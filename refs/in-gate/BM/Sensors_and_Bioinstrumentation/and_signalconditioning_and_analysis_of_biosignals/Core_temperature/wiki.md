Normal human body temperature, also known as normothermia or euthermia, is the
typical temperature range found in humans. The normal human body temperature
range is typically stated as 36.5â37.5 Â°C (97.7â99.5 Â°F).[8] The
"perfect" body temperature has been stated as 36.5 by Dr Andrea Ward.
Individual body temperature depends upon the age, exertion, infection, sex, and
reproductive status of the subject, the time of day, the place in the body at
which the measurement is made, and the subject's state of consciousness
(waking, sleeping or sedated), activity level, and emotional state. It is
typically maintained within this range by thermoregulation.

***** Methods of measurement[edit] *****
A medical_thermometer showing a temperature reading of 38.7 Â°C
Taking a person's temperature is an initial part of a full clinical
examination. There are various types of medical_thermometers, as well as sites
used for measurement, including:
    * In the rectum (rectal temperature)
    * In the mouth (oral temperature)
    * Under the arm (axillary temperature)
    * In the ear (tympanic temperature)
    * in the nose
    * In the vagina (vaginal temperature)
    * In the bladder
    * On the skin of the forehead over the temporal_artery
***** Variations[edit] *****
Diurnal variation in body temperature, ranging from about 37.5 Â°C from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m., and falling to about 36.4 Â°C from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Temperature control (thermoregulation) is part of a homeostatic mechanism that
keeps the organism at optimum operating_temperature, as the temperature affects
the rate of chemical_reactions. In humans, the average internal temperature is
37.0 Â°C (98.6 Â°F), though it varies among individuals. However, no person
always has exactly the same temperature at every moment of the day.
Temperatures cycle regularly up and down through the day, as controlled by the
person's circadian_rhythm. The lowest temperature occurs about two hours before
the person normally wakes up. Additionally, temperatures change according to
activities and external factors.[9][unreliable_medical_source?]
In addition to varying throughout the day, normal body temperature may also
differ as much as 0.5 Â°C (0.9 Â°F) from one day to the next, so that the
highest or lowest temperatures on one day will not always exactly match the
highest or lowest temperatures on the next day.
Normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the
time of day. Consequently, each type of measurement has a range of normal
temperatures. The range for normal human body temperatures, taken orally, is
36.8Â±0.5 Â°C (98.2Â±0.9 Â°F).[10] This means that any oral temperature between
36.3 and 37.3 Â°C (97.3 and 99.1 Â°F) is likely to be normal.
The normal human body temperature is often stated as 36.5â37.5 Â°C
(97.7â99.5 Â°F).[8] In adults a review of the literature has found a wider
range of 33.2â38.2 Â°C (91.8â100.8 Â°F) for normal temperatures, depending
on the gender and location measured.[11]
Reported values vary depending on how it is measured: oral (under the tongue):
36.8Â±0.4 Â°C (98.2Â±0.72 Â°F),[12] internal (rectal, vaginal): 37.0 Â°C
(98.6 Â°F).[12] A rectal or vaginal measurement taken directly inside the body
cavity is typically slightly higher than oral measurement, and oral measurement
is somewhat higher than skin measurement. Other places, such as under the arm
or in the ear, produce different typical temperatures.[12] While some people
think of these averages as representing normal or ideal measurements, a wide
range of temperatures has been found in healthy people.[5] The body temperature
of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 Â°C (0.9 Â°F) with lower
temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and
evening, as the body's needs and activities change.[12] Other circumstances
also affect the body's temperature. The core body temperature of an individual
tends to have the lowest value in the second half of the sleep cycle; the
lowest point, called the nadir, is one of the primary markers for circadian
rhythms. The body temperature also changes when a person is hungry, sleepy,
sick, or cold.
**** Natural rhythms[edit] ****
Body temperature normally fluctuates over the day following Circadian_rhythms,
with the lowest levels around 4 a.m. and the highest in the late afternoon,
between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. (assuming the person sleeps at night and stays awake
during the day).[10][12] Therefore, an oral temperature of 37.3 Â°C (99.1 Â°F)
would, strictly speaking, be a normal, healthy temperature in the afternoon but
not in the early morning.[12] An individual's body temperature typically
changes by about 0.5 Â°C (0.9 Â°F) between its highest and lowest points each
day.[10][12]
Body temperature is sensitive to many hormones, so women have a temperature
rhythm that varies with the menstrual_cycle, called a circamensal rhythm.[9] A
woman's basal_body_temperature rises sharply after ovulation, as estrogen
production decreases and progesterone increases. Fertility_awareness programs
use this change to identify when a woman has ovulated in order to achieve or
avoid pregnancy. During the luteal_phase of the menstrual cycle, both the
lowest and the average temperatures are slightly higher than during other parts
of the cycle. However, the amount that the temperature rises during each day is
slightly lower than typical, so the highest temperature of the day is not very
much higher than usual.[13][unreliable_medical_source?] Hormonal_contraceptives
both suppress the circamensal rhythm and raise the typical body temperature by
about 0.6 Â°C (1.1 Â°F).[9]
Temperature also varies with the change of seasons during each year. This
pattern is called a circannual rhythm.[13] Studies of seasonal variations have
produced inconsistent results. People living in different climates may have
different seasonal patterns.
Increased physical fitness increases the amount of daily variation in
temperature.[13]
With increased age, both average body temperature and the amount of daily
variability in the body temperature tend to decrease.[13] Elderly patients may
have a decreased ability to generate body heat during a fever, so even a
somewhat_elevated_temperature can indicate a serious underlying cause in
geriatrics.
**** Measurement methods[edit] ****
                  Temperature by measurement technique[14]
Method   Women                              Men
Oral     33.2â38.1 Â°C (91.8â1035.7â37.7 Â°C (96.3â99.9 Â°F)
Rectal   36.8â37.1 Â°C (98.2â9836.7â37.5 Â°C (98.1â99.5 Â°F)
Tympanic 35.7â37.5 Â°C (96.3â9935.5â37.5 Â°C (95.9â99.5 Â°F)
Different methods used for measuring temperature produce different results. The
temperature reading depends on which part of the body is being measured. The
typical daytime temperatures among healthy adults are as follows:
    * Temperature in the anus (rectum/rectal), vagina, or in the ear (otic) is
      about 37.5 Â°C (99.5 Â°F)[15][medical_citation_needed]
    * Temperature in the mouth (oral) is about 36.8 Â°C (98.2 Â°F)[10]
    * Temperature under the arm (axillary) is about 36.5 Â°C (97.7 Â°F)[15]
      [medical_citation_needed]
Generally, oral, rectal, gut, and core body temperatures, although slightly
different, are well-correlated.
Oral temperatures are influenced by drinking, chewing, smoking, and breathing
with the mouth open. Mouth breathing, cold drinks or food reduce oral
temperatures; hot drinks, hot food, chewing, and smoking raise oral
temperatures.[9]
Each measurement method also has different normal ranges depending on sex.
[citation_needed]
**** Variations due to outside factors[edit] ****
Many outside factors affect the measured temperature as well. "Normal" values
are generally given for an otherwise healthy, non-fasting adult, dressed
comfortably, indoors, in a room that is kept at a normal room temperature, 22.7
to 24.4 Â°C (73 to 76 Â°F), during the morning, but not shortly after arising
from sleep. Furthermore, for oral temperatures, the subject must not have
eaten, drunk, or smoked anything in at least the previous fifteen to twenty
minutes, as the temperature of the food, drink, or smoke can dramatically
affect the reading.
Temperature is increased after eating or drinking anything with calories.
Caloric restriction, as for a weight-loss_diet, decreases overall body
temperature.[9] Drinking alcohol decreases the amount of daily change, slightly
lowering daytime temperatures and noticeably raising nighttime temperatures.[9]
Exercise raises body temperatures. In adults, a noticeable increase usually
requires strenuous exercise or exercise sustained over a significant time.
Children develop higher temperatures with milder activities, like playing.
Psychological factors also influence body temperature: a very excited person
often has an elevated temperature.
Wearing more clothing slows daily temperature change and raises body
temperature.[9] Similarly, sleeping with an electric_blanket raises the body
temperature at night.[9]
Sleep disturbances also affect temperatures. Normally, body temperature drops
significantly at a person's normal bedtime and throughout the night. Short-term
sleep_deprivation produces a higher temperature at night than normal, but long-
term sleep deprivation appears to reduce temperatures.[9] Insomnia and poor
sleep quality are associated with smaller and later drops in body temperature.
[9] Similarly, waking up unusually early, sleeping in, jet_lag and changes to
shift_work schedules may affect body temperature.[9]
***** Concepts[edit] *****
**** Fever[edit] ****
Main article: Fever
A temperature setpoint is the level at which the body attempts to maintain its
temperature. When the setpoint is raised, the result is a fever. Most fevers
are caused by infectious_disease and can be lowered, if desired, with
antipyretic medications.
An early morning temperature higher than 37.2 Â°C (99.0 Â°F) or a late
afternoon temperature higher than 37.7 Â°C (99.9 Â°F) is normally considered a
fever, assuming that the temperature is elevated due to a change in the
hypothalamus's setpoint.[12] Lower thresholds are sometimes appropriate for
elderly people.[12] The normal daily temperature variation is typically 0.5 Â°C
(0.90 Â°F), but can be greater among people recovering from a fever.[12]
An organism at optimum temperature is considered afebrile or apyrexic, meaning
"without fever". If temperature is raised, but the setpoint is not raised, then
the result is hyperthermia.
**** Hyperthermia[edit] ****
Main article: Hyperthermia
Hyperthermia occurs when the body produces or absorbs more heat than it can
dissipate. It is usually caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures. The
heat-regulating mechanisms of the body eventually become overwhelmed and unable
to deal effectively with the heat, causing the body temperature to climb
uncontrollably. Hyperthermia at or above about 40 Â°C (104 Â°F) is a life-
threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Common
symptoms include headache, confusion, and fatigue. If sweating has resulted in
dehydration, then the affected person may have dry, red skin.
In a medical setting, mild hyperthermia is commonly called heat exhaustion or
heat prostration; severe hyperthermia is called heat stroke. Heat stroke may
come on suddenly, but it usually follows the untreated milder stages. Treatment
involves cooling and rehydrating the body; fever-reducing drugs are useless for
this condition. This may be done through moving out of direct sunlight to a
cooler and shaded environment, drinking water, removing clothing that might
keep heat close to the body, or sitting in front of a fan. Bathing in tepid or
cool water, or even just washing the face and other exposed areas of the skin,
can be helpful.
With fever, the body's core temperature rises to a higher temperature through
the action of the part of the brain that controls the body temperature; with
hyperthermia, the body temperature is raised without the influence of the heat
control centers.
**** Hypothermia[edit] ****
Main article: Hypothermia
In hypothermia, body temperature drops below that required for normal
metabolism and bodily functions. In humans, this is usually due to excessive
exposure to cold air or water, but it can be deliberately_induced_as_a_medical
treatment. Symptoms usually appear when the body's core temperature drops by
1â2 Â°C (1.8â3.6 Â°F) below normal temperature.
**** Basal body temperature[edit] ****
Main article: Basal_body_temperature
Basal body temperature is the lowest temperature attained by the body during
rest (usually during sleep). It is generally measured immediately after
awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken, although the
temperature measured at that time is somewhat higher than the true basal body
temperature. In women, temperature differs at various points in the menstrual
cycle, and this can be used in the long term to track ovulation both for the
purpose of aiding conception or avoiding pregnancy. This process is called
fertility_awareness.
**** Core temperature[edit] ****
Core temperature, also called core body temperature, is the operating
temperature of an organism, specifically in deep structures of the body such as
the liver, in comparison to temperatures of peripheral tissues. Core
temperature is normally maintained within a narrow range so that essential
enzymatic reactions can occur. Significant core temperature elevation
(hyperthermia) or depression (hypothermia) over more than a brief period of
time is incompatible with human life.
Temperature examination in the rectum is the traditional gold_standard
measurement used to estimate core temperature (oral temperature is affected by
hot or cold drinks and mouth-breathing). Rectal temperature is expected to be
approximately one Fahrenheit degree higher than an oral temperature taken on
the same person at the same time. Ear thermometers measure eardrum temperature
using infrared sensors. The blood supply to the tympanic_membrane is shared
with the brain. However, this method of measuring body temperature is not as
accurate as rectal measurement and has a low sensitivity for fevers, missing
three or four out of every ten fevers in children.[16] Ear temperature
measurement may be acceptable for observing trends in body temperature but is
less useful in consistently identifying fevers.
Until recently, direct measurement of core body temperature required surgical
insertion of a probe, so a variety of indirect methods have commonly been used.
The rectal or vaginal temperature is generally considered to give the most
accurate assessment of core body temperature, particularly in hypothermia. In
the early 2000s, ingestible thermistors in capsule form were produced, allowing
the temperature inside the digestive_tract to be transmitted to an external
receiver; one study found that these were comparable in accuracy to rectal
temperature measurement.[17]

      (57.6 Â°F).[20]
***** Historical understanding[edit] *****
In the 19th century, most books quoted "blood heat" as 98 Â°F, until a study
published the mean (but not the variance) of a large sample as 36.88 Â°C
(98.38 Â°F).[21] Subsequently that mean was widely quoted as "37 Â°C or 98.4
Â°F"[22][23] until editors realised 37 Â°C is closer to 98.6 Â°F than 98.4 Â°F.
The 37 Â°C value was set by German physician Carl_Reinhold_August_Wunderlich in
his 1868 book,[24] which put temperature charts into widespread clinical use.
[25] Dictionaries and other sources that quoted these averages did add the word
"about" to show that there is some variance, but generally did not state how
wide the variance is.
