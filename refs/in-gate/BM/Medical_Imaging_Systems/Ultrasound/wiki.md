Fetal ultrasound
Ultrasound is sound_waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit
of human hearing. Ultrasound is not different from "normal" (audible) sound in
its physical properties, except that humans cannot hear it. This limit varies
from person to person and is approximately 20 kilohertz (20,000 hertz) in
healthy young adults. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz
up to several gigahertz.
Ultrasound is used in many different fields. Ultrasonic devices are used to
detect objects and measure distances. Ultrasound_imaging or sonography is often
used in medicine. In the nondestructive_testing of products and structures,
ultrasound is used to detect invisible flaws. Industrially, ultrasound is used
for cleaning, mixing, and accelerating chemical processes. Animals such as bats
and porpoises use ultrasound for locating prey and obstacles.[1] Scientists are
also studying ultrasound using graphene diaphragms as a method of
communication.[2]

***** History *****
Galton whistle, one of the first devices to produce ultrasound
Acoustics, the science of sound, starts as far back as Pythagoras in the 6th
century BC, who wrote on the mathematical properties of stringed_instruments.
Echolocation in bats was discovered by Lazzaro_Spallanzani in 1794, when he
demonstrated that bats hunted and navigated by inaudible sound, not vision.
Francis_Galton in 1893 invented the Galton_whistle, an adjustable whistle that
produced ultrasound, which he used to measure the hearing range of humans and
other animals, demonstrating that many animals could hear sounds above the
hearing range of humans. The first technological application of ultrasound was
an attempt to detect submarines by Paul_Langevin in 1917. The piezoelectric
effect, discovered by Jacques and Pierre_Curie in 1880, was useful in
transducers to generate and detect ultrasonic waves in air and water.[3]
***** Definition *****
Approximate frequency ranges corresponding to ultrasound, with rough guide of
some applications
Ultrasound is defined by the American_National_Standards_Institute as "sound at
frequencies greater than 20 kHz". In air at atmospheric pressure, ultrasonic
waves have wavelengths of 1.9 cm or less.
***** Perception *****
**** Humans ****
The upper frequency limit in humans (approximately 20 kHz) is due to
limitations of the middle_ear. Auditory_sensation can occur if highâintensity
ultrasound is fed directly into the human_skull and reaches the cochlea through
bone_conduction, without passing through the middle ear.[4]
Children can hear some high-pitched sounds that older adults cannot hear,
because in humans the upper limit pitch of hearing tends to decrease with age.
[5] An American cell_phone company has used this to create ring signals that
supposedly are only audible to younger humans,[6] but many older people can
hear the signals, which may be because of the considerable variation of age-
related deterioration in the upper hearing threshold. The_Mosquito is an
electronic device that uses a high pitched frequency to deter loitering by
young people.
**** Animals ****
Bats use ultrasounds to navigate in the darkness.
A dog_whistle, a whistle which emits sound in the ultrasonic range, used to
train dogs and other animals
Bats use a variety of ultrasonic ranging (echolocation) techniques to detect
their prey. They can detect frequencies beyond 100 kHz, possibly up to 200 kHz.
[7]
Many insects have good ultrasonic hearing, and most of these are nocturnal
insects listening for echolocating bats. These include many groups of moths,
beetles, praying_mantids and lacewings. Upon hearing a bat, some insects will
make evasive_manoeuvres to escape being caught.[8] Ultrasonic frequencies
trigger a reflex_action in the noctuid moth that causes it to drop slightly in
its flight to evade attack.[9] Tiger_moths also emit clicks which may disturb
bats' echolocation,[10][11] and in other cases may advertise the fact that they
are poisonous by emitting sound.[12][13]
Dogs and cats' hearing range extends into the ultrasound; the top end of a
dog's hearing range is about 45 kHz, while a cat's is 64 kHz.[14][15] The wild
ancestors of cats and dogs evolved this higher hearing range to hear high-
frequency sounds made by their preferred prey, small rodents.[14] A dog_whistle
is a whistle that emits ultrasound, used for training and calling dogs. The
frequency of most dog whistles is within the range of 23 to 54 kHz.[16]
Toothed_whales, including dolphins, can hear ultrasound and use such sounds in
their navigational system (biosonar) to orient and to capture prey.[17]
Porpoises have the highest known upper hearing limit at around 160 kHz.[18]
Several types of fish can detect ultrasound. In the order Clupeiformes, members
of the subfamily Alosinae (shad) have been shown to be able to detect sounds up
to 180 kHz, while the other subfamilies (e.g. herrings) can hear only up to
4 kHz.[19]
Ultrasound generator/speaker systems are sold as electronic_pest_control
devices, which are claimed to frighten away rodents and insects, but there is
no scientific evidence that the devices work.[20][21][22]
***** Detection and ranging *****
**** Non-contact sensor ****
An ultrasonic level or sensing system requires no contact with the target. For
many processes in the medical, pharmaceutical, military and general industries
this is an advantage over inline sensors that may contaminate the liquids
inside a vessel or tube or that may be clogged by the product.
Both continuous wave and pulsed systems are used. The principle behind a
pulsed-ultrasonic technology is that the transmit signal consists of short
bursts of ultrasonic energy. After each burst, the electronics looks for a
return signal within a small window of time corresponding to the time it takes
for the energy to pass through the vessel. Only a signal received during this
window will qualify for additional signal processing.
A popular consumer application of ultrasonic ranging was the Polaroid_SX-70
camera, which included a lightweight transducer system to focus the camera
automatically. Polaroid later licensed this ultrasound technology and it became
the basis of a variety of ultrasonic products.
**** Motion sensors and flow measurement ****
A common ultrasound application is an automatic door opener, where an
ultrasonic sensor detects a person's approach and opens the door. Ultrasonic
sensors are also used to detect intruders; the ultrasound can cover a wide area
from a single point. The flow in pipes or open channels can be measured by
ultrasonic flowmeters, which measure the average velocity of flowing liquid. In
rheology, an acoustic_rheometer relies on the principle of ultrasound. In fluid
mechanics, fluid flow can be measured using an ultrasonic_flow_meter.
**** Nondestructive testing ****
See also: Macrosonic and Ultrasonic_testing
Principle of flaw detection with ultrasound. A void in the solid material
reflects some energy back to the transducer, which is detected and displayed.
Ultrasonic_testing is a type of nondestructive_testing commonly used to find
flaws in materials and to measure the thickness of objects. Frequencies of 2 to
10 MHz are common, but for special purposes other frequencies are used.
Inspection may be manual or automated and is an essential part of modern
manufacturing processes. Most metals can be inspected as well as plastics and
aerospace composites. Lower frequency ultrasound (50â500 kHz) can also be
used to inspect less dense materials such as wood, concrete and cement.
Ultrasound inspection of welded joints has been an alternative to radiography
for nondestructive_testing since the 1960s. Ultrasonic inspection eliminates
the use of ionizing radiation, with safety and cost benefits. Ultrasound can
also provide additional information such as the depth of flaws in a welded
joint. Ultrasonic inspection has progressed from manual methods to computerized
systems that automate much of the process. An ultrasonic test of a joint can
identify the existence of flaws, measure their size, and identify their
location. Not all welded materials are equally amenable to ultrasonic
inspection; some materials have a large grain size that produces a high level
of background noise in measurements.[23]

Ultrasonic_thickness_measurement is one technique used to monitor quality of
welds.
**** Ultrasonic range finding ****
Principle of an active sonar
Main article: Sonar
A common use of ultrasound is in underwater range_finding; this use is also
called Sonar. An ultrasonic pulse is generated in a particular direction. If
there is an object in the path of this pulse, part or all of the pulse will be
reflected back to the transmitter as an echo and can be detected through the
receiver path. By measuring the difference in time between the pulse being
transmitted and the echo being received, it is possible to determine the
distance.
The measured travel time of Sonar pulses in water is strongly dependent on the
temperature and the salinity of the water. Ultrasonic ranging is also applied
for measurement in air and for short distances. For example, hand-held
ultrasonic measuring tools can rapidly measure the layout of rooms.
Although range finding underwater is performed at both sub-audible and audible
frequencies for great distances (1 to several kilometers), ultrasonic range
finding is used when distances are shorter and the accuracy of the distance
measurement is desired to be finer. Ultrasonic measurements may be limited
through barrier layers with large salinity, temperature or vortex
differentials. Ranging in water varies from about hundreds to thousands of
meters, but can be performed with centimeters to meters accuracy
**** Ultrasound Identification (USID) ****
Ultrasound_Identification (USID) is a Real_Time_Locating System (RTLS) or
Indoor_Positioning_System (IPS) technology used to automatically track and
identify the location of objects in real time using simple, inexpensive nodes
(badges/tags) attached to or embedded in objects and devices, which then
transmit an ultrasound signal to communicate their location to microphone
sensors.
***** Imaging *****
Main article: Medical_ultrasonography

The potential for ultrasonic imaging of objects, with a 3 GHz sound wave
producing resolution comparable to an optical image, was recognized by Sokolov
in 1939, but techniques of the time produced relatively low-contrast images
with poor sensitivity.[24] Ultrasonic imaging uses frequencies of 2 megahertz
and higher; the shorter wavelength allows resolution of small internal details
in structures and tissues. The power density is generally less than 1 watt per
square centimetre to avoid heating and cavitation effects in the object under
examination.[25] High and ultra high ultrasound waves are used in acoustic
microscopy, with frequencies up to 4 gigahertz. Ultrasonic imaging applications
include industrial nondestructive testing, quality control and medical uses.
[24]
***** Acoustic microscopy *****
Acoustic_microscopy is the technique of using sound waves to visualize
structures too small to be resolved by the human eye. Frequencies up to several
gigahertz are used in acoustic microscopes. The reflection and diffraction of
sound waves from microscopic structures can yield information not available
with light.
**** Human medicine ****
See also: Medical_ultrasonography
Medical sonography (ultrasonography) is an ultrasound-based diagnostic medical
imaging technique used to visualize muscles, tendons, and many internal organs
to capture their size, structure and any pathological lesions with real time
tomographic images. Ultrasound has been used by radiologists and sonographers
to image the human body for at least 50 years and has become a widely used
diagnostic tool. The technology is relatively inexpensive and portable,
especially when compared with other techniques, such as magnetic_resonance
imaging (MRI) and computed_tomography (CT). Ultrasound is also used to
visualize fetuses during routine and emergency prenatal_care. Such diagnostic
applications used during pregnancy are referred to as obstetric_sonography. As
currently applied in the medical field, properly performed ultrasound poses no
known risks to the patient.[26] Sonography does not use ionizing_radiation, and
the power levels used for imaging are too low to cause adverse heating or
pressure effects in tissue.[27][28] Although the long-term effects due to
ultrasound exposure at diagnostic intensity are still unknown,[29] currently
most doctors feel that the benefits to patients outweigh the risks.[30] The
ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle has been advocated for an
ultrasound examination â that is, keeping the scanning time and power
settings as low as possible but consistent with diagnostic imaging â and that
by that principle nonmedical uses, which by definition are not necessary, are
actively discouraged.[31]
Ultrasound is also increasingly being used in trauma and first aid cases, with
emergency_ultrasound becoming a staple of most EMT response teams. Furthermore,
ultrasound is used in remote diagnosis cases where teleconsultation is
required, such as scientific experiments in space or mobile sports team
diagnosis.[32]
According to RadiologyInfo,[33] ultrasounds are useful in the detection of
pelvic abnormalities and can involve techniques known as abdominal
(transabdominal) ultrasound, vaginal (transvaginal or endovaginal) ultrasound
in women, and also rectal (transrectal) ultrasound in men.
**** Veterinary medicine ****
See also: Preclinical_imaging
Diagnostic ultrasound is used externally in horses for evaluation of soft
tissue and tendon injuries, and internally in particular for reproductive work
â evaluation of the reproductive tract of the mare and pregnancy detection.
[34] It may also be used in an external manner in stallions for evaluation of
testicular condition and diameter as well as internally for reproductive
evaluation (deferent duct etc.).[35]
Starting at the turn of the century, ultrasound technology began to be used by
the beef cattle industry to improve animal health and the yield of cattle
operations.[36] Ultrasound is used to evaluate fat thickness, rib eye area, and
intramuscular fat in living animals.[37] It is also used to evaluate the health
and characteristics of unborn calves.
Ultrasound technology provides a means for cattle producers to obtain
information that can be used to improve the breeding and husbandry of cattle.
The technology can be expensive, and it requires a substantial time commitment
for continuous data collection and operator training.[37] Nevertheless, this
technology has proven useful in managing and running a cattle breeding
operation.[36]
***** Processing and power *****
High-power applications of ultrasound often use frequencies between 20 kHz and
a few hundred kHz. Intensities can be very high; above 10 watts per square
centimeter, cavitation can be inducted in liquid media, and some applications
use up to 1000 watts per square centimeter. Such high intensities can induce
chemical changes or produce significant effects by direct mechanical action,
and can inactivate harmful microorganisms.[25]
**** Physical therapy ****
Main article: therapeutic_ultrasound
Ultrasound has been used since the 1940s by physical and occupational
therapists for treating connective_tissue: ligaments, tendons, and fascia (and
also scar_tissue).[38] Conditions for which ultrasound may be used for
treatment include the follow examples: ligament sprains, muscle strains,
tendonitis, joint inflammation, plantar_fasciitis, metatarsalgia, facet
irritation, impingement_syndrome, bursitis, rheumatoid_arthritis,
osteoarthritis, and scar tissue adhesion.
**** Biomedical applications ****
Ultrasound also has therapeutic applications, which can be highly beneficial
when used with dosage precautions.[39] Relatively high power ultrasound can
break up stony deposits or tissue, accelerate the effect of drugs in a targeted
area, assist in the measurement of the elastic properties of tissue, and can be
used to sort cells or small particles for research.
**** Ultrasonic impact treatment ****

Ultrasonic_impact_treatment (UIT) uses ultrasound to enhance the mechanical and
physical properties of metals.[40] It is a metallurgical processing technique
in which ultrasonic energy is applied to a metal object. Ultrasonic treatment
can result in controlled residual compressive stress, grain refinement and
grain size reduction. Low and high cycle fatigue are enhanced and have been
documented to provide increases up to ten times greater than non-UIT specimens.
Additionally, UIT has proven effective in addressing stress_corrosion_cracking,
corrosion_fatigue and related issues.
When the UIT tool, made up of the ultrasonic transducer, pins and other
components, comes into contact with the work piece it acoustically couples with
the work piece, creating harmonic resonance.[41] This harmonic resonance is
performed at a carefully calibrated frequency, to which metals respond very
favorably.
Depending on the desired effects of treatment a combination of different
frequencies and displacement amplitude is applied. These frequencies range
between 25 and 55 kHz,[42] with the displacement amplitude of the resonant body
of between 22 and 50 Âµm (0.00087 and 0.0020 in).
UIT devices rely on magnetostrictive transducers.
**** Processing ****
Main article: Sonication
Ultrasonication offers great potential in the processing of liquids and
slurries, by improving the mixing and chemical reactions in various
applications and industries. Ultrasonication generates alternating low-pressure
and high-pressure waves in liquids, leading to the formation and violent
collapse of small vacuum bubbles. This phenomenon is termed cavitation and
causes high speed impinging liquid jets and strong hydrodynamic shear-forces.
These effects are used for the deagglomeration and milling of micrometre and
nanometre-size materials as well as for the disintegration of cells or the
mixing of reactants. In this aspect, ultrasonication is an alternative to high-
speed mixers and agitator bead mills. Ultrasonic foils under the moving wire in
a paper machine will use the shock waves from the imploding bubbles to
distribute the cellulose fibres more uniformly in the produced paper web, which
will make a stronger paper with more even surfaces. Furthermore, chemical
reactions benefit from the free radicals created by the cavitation as well as
from the energy input and the material transfer through boundary layers. For
many processes, this sonochemical (see sonochemistry) effect leads to a
substantial reduction in the reaction time, like in the transesterification of
oil into biodiesel.
Schematic of bench and industrial-scale ultrasonic liquid processors
Substantial ultrasonic intensity and high ultrasonic vibration amplitudes are
required for many processing applications, such as nano-crystallization, nano-
emulsification,[43] deagglomeration, extraction, cell disruption, as well as
many others. Commonly, a process is first tested on a laboratory scale to prove
feasibility and establish some of the required ultrasonic exposure parameters.
After this phase is complete, the process is transferred to a pilot (bench)
scale for flow-through pre-production optimization and then to an industrial
scale for continuous production. During these scale-up steps, it is essential
to make sure that all local exposure conditions (ultrasonic amplitude,
cavitation intensity, time spent in the active cavitation zone, etc.) stay the
same. If this condition is met, the quality of the final product remains at the
optimized level, while the productivity is increased by a predictable "scale-up
factor". The productivity increase results from the fact that laboratory, bench
and industrial-scale ultrasonic processor systems incorporate progressively
larger ultrasonic_horns, able to generate progressively larger high-intensity
cavitation zones and, therefore, to process more material per unit of time.
This is called "direct scalability". It is important to point out that
increasing the power of the ultrasonic processor alone does not result in
direct scalability, since it may be (and frequently is) accompanied by a
reduction in the ultrasonic amplitude and cavitation intensity. During direct
scale-up, all processing conditions must be maintained, while the power rating
of the equipment is increased in order to enable the operation of a larger
ultrasonic horn.[44][45][46]
**** Ultrasonic manipulation and characterization of particles ****
A researcher at the Industrial Materials Research Institute, Alessandro
Malutta, devised an experiment that demonstrated the trapping action of
ultrasonic standing waves on wood pulp fibers diluted in water and their
parallel orienting into the equidistant pressure planes.[47] The time to orient
the fibers in equidistant planes is measured with a laser and an electro-
optical sensor. This could provide the paper industry a quick on-line fiber
size measurement system. A somewhat different implementation was demonstrated
at Pennsylvania State University using a microchip which generated a pair of
perpendicular standing surface acoustic waves allowing to position particles
equidistant to each other on a grid. This experiment, called acoustic_tweezers,
can be used for applications in material sciences, biology, physics, chemistry
and nanotechnology.
**** Ultrasonic cleaning ****
Main article: Ultrasonic_cleaning
Ultrasonic_cleaners, sometimes mistakenly called supersonic cleaners, are used
at frequencies from 20 to 40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts,
watches, dental_instruments, surgical_instruments, diving_regulators and
industrial parts. An ultrasonic cleaner works mostly by energy released from
the collapse of millions of microscopic cavitations near the dirty surface. The
bubbles made by cavitation collapse forming tiny jets directed at the surface.
**** Ultrasonic disintegration ****
Similar to ultrasonic cleaning, biological_cells including bacteria can be
disintegrated. High power ultrasound produces cavitation that facilitates
particle disintegration or reactions. This has uses in biological_science for
analytical or chemical purposes (sonication and sonoporation) and in killing
bacteria in sewage. High power ultrasound can disintegrate corn slurry and
enhance liquefaction and saccharification for higher ethanol yield in dry corn
milling plants.[48][49]
**** Ultrasonic humidifier ****
The ultrasonic humidifier, one type of nebulizer (a device that creates a very
fine spray), is a popular type of humidifier. It works by vibrating a metal
plate at ultrasonic frequencies to nebulize (sometimes incorrectly called
"atomize") the water. Because the water is not heated for evaporation, it
produces a cool mist. The ultrasonic pressure waves nebulize not only the water
but also materials in the water including calcium, other minerals, viruses,
fungi, bacteria,[50] and other impurities. Illness caused by impurities that
reside in a humidifier's reservoir fall under the heading of "Humidifier
Fever".
Ultrasonic humidifiers are frequently used in aeroponics, where they are
generally referred to as foggers.
**** Ultrasonic welding ****
In ultrasonic_welding of plastics, high frequency (15 kHz to 40 kHz ) low
amplitude vibration is used to create heat by way of friction between the
materials to be joined. The interface of the two parts is specially designed to
concentrate the energy for maximum weld strength.
**** Sonochemistry ****
Main article: Sonochemistry
Power ultrasound in the 20â100 kHz range is used in chemistry. The ultrasound
does not interact directly with molecules to induce the chemical change, as its
typical wavelength (in the millimeter range) is too long compared to the
molecules. Instead, the energy causes cavitation which generates extremes of
temperature and pressure in the liquid where the reaction happens. Ultrasound
also breaks up solids and removes passivating layers of inert material to give
a larger surface_area for the reaction to occur over. Both of these effects
make the reaction faster. In 2008, Atul_Kumar reported synthesis of Hantzsch
esters and polyhydroquinoline derivatives via multi-component reaction protocol
in aqueous micelles using ultrasound.[51]
Ultrasound is used in extraction, using different frequencies.
**** Weapons ****
Ultrasound has been studied as a basis for sonic_weapons, for applications such
as riot control, disorientation of attackers, up to lethal levels of sound.
**** Wireless communication ****
In July 2015, The_Economist reported that researchers at the University_of
California,_Berkeley have conducted ultrasound studies using graphene
diaphragms. The thinness and low weight of graphene combined with its strength
make it an effective material to use in ultrasound communications. One
suggested application of the technology would be underwater communications,
where radio waves typically do not travel well.[2]
***** Other uses *****
Ultrasound when applied in specific configurations can produce short bursts of
light in an exotic phenomenon known as sonoluminescence. This phenomenon is
being investigated partly because of the possibility of bubble_fusion (a
nuclear_fusion reaction hypothesized to occur during sonoluminescence).
Ultrasound is used when characterizing particulates through the technique of
ultrasound_attenuation_spectroscopy or by observing electroacoustic_phenomena
or by transcranial_pulsed_ultrasound.
Audio can be propagated by modulated_ultrasound.
A formerly popular consumer application of ultrasound was in television remote
controls for adjusting volume and changing channels. Introduced by Zenith in
the late 1950s, the system used a hand-held remote control containing short rod
resonators struck by small hammers, and a microphone on the set. Filters and
detectors discriminated between the various operations. The principal
advantages were that no battery was needed in the hand-held control box and,
unlike radio waves, the ultrasound was unlikely to affect neighboring sets.
Ultrasound remained in use until displaced by infrared systems starting in the
late 1980s.[52]
***** Safety *****
Occupational exposure to ultrasound in excess of 120 dB may lead to hearing
loss. Exposure in excess of 155 dB may produce heating effects that are harmful
to the human body, and it has been calculated that exposures above 180 dB may
lead to death.[53] The UK's independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising
Radiation (AGNIR) produced a report in 2010, which was published by the UK
Health Protection Agency (HPA). This report recommended an exposure limit for
the general public to airborne ultrasound sound pressure levels (SPL) of 70 dB
(at 20 kHz), and 100 dB (at 25 kHz and above).[54]
