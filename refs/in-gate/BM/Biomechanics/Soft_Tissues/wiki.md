In anatomy, soft tissue includes the tissues that connect, support, or surround
other structures and organs of the body, not being hard_tissue such as bone.
Soft tissue includes tendons, ligaments, fascia, skin, fibrous_tissues, fat,
and synovial_membranes (which are connective_tissue), and muscles, nerves and
blood_vessels (which are not connective tissue).[1]
It is sometimes defined by what it is not. Soft tissue has been defined as
"nonepithelial, extraskeletal mesenchyme exclusive of the reticuloendothelial
system and glia".[2]

***** Composition[edit] *****
The characteristic substances inside the extracellular_matrix of this kind of
tissue are the collagen, elastin and ground_substance. Normally the soft tissue
is very hydrated because of the ground substance. The fibroblasts are the most
common cell responsible for the production of soft tissues' fibers and ground
substance. Variations of fibroblasts, like chondroblasts, may also produce
these substances.[3]
***** Mechanical characteristics[edit] *****
At small strains, elastin confers stiffness to the tissue and stores most of
the strain_energy. The collagen fibers are comparatively inextensible and are
usually loose (wavy, crimped). With increasing tissue deformation the collagen
is gradually stretched in the direction of deformation. When taut, these fibers
produce a strong growth in tissue stiffness. The composite behavior is
analogous to a nylon_stocking, whose rubber band does the role of elastin as
the nylon does the role of collagen. In soft tissues, the collagen limits the
deformation and protects the tissues from injury.
Human soft tissue is highly deformable, and its mechanical properties vary
significantly from one person to another. Impact testing results showed that
the stiffness and the damping resistance of a test subjectâs tissue are
correlated with the mass, velocity, and size of the striking object. Such
properties may be useful for forensics investigation when contusions were
induced.[4] When a solid object impacts a human soft tissue, the energy of the
impact will be absorbed by the tissues to reduce the effect of the impact or
the pain level; subjects with more soft tissue thickness tended to absorb the
impacts with less aversion.[5]

soft tissue.
Soft tissues have the potential to undergo large deformations and still return
to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. they are hyperelastic
materials, and their stress-strain_curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are
also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic
properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis.[6]
[7] In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several
methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models
based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive
equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a
linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.[8]
**** Pseudoelasticity[edit] ****
Even though soft tissues have viscoelastic properties, i.e. stress as function
of strain rate, it can be approximated by a hyperelastic model after
precondition to a load pattern. After some cycles of loading and unloading the
material, the mechanical response becomes independent of strain rate.
          S  =  S  (  E  ,     E  &#x02D9;    )  &#x2192;   S  =  S  (  E  )
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {S} =\mathbf {S} (\mathbf {E} ,{\dot {\mathbf {E}
      }})\quad \rightarrow \quad \mathbf {S} =\mathbf {S} (\mathbf {E} )}  [
      {\mathbf  {S}}={\mathbf  {S}}({\mathbf  {E}},{\dot  {{\mathbf
      {E}}}})\quad \rightarrow \quad {\mathbf  {S}}={\mathbf  {S}}({\mathbf
      {E}})]
Despite the independence of strain rate, preconditioned soft tissues still
present hysteresis, so the mechanical response can be modeled as hyperelastic
with different material constants at loading and unloading. By this method the
elasticity theory is used to model an inelastic material. Fung has called this
model as pseudoelastic to point out that the material is not truly elastic.[7]
**** Residual stress[edit] ****
In physiological state soft tissues usually present residual_stress that may be
released when the tissue is excised. Physiologists and histologists must be
aware of this fact to avoid mistakes when analyzing excised tissues. This
retraction usually causes a visual artifact.[7]
**** Fung-elastic material[edit] ****
Fung developed a constitutive_equation for preconditioned soft_tissues which is
         W =   1 2    [  q + c  (   e  Q   &#x2212; 1  )   ]    {\displaystyle
      W={\frac {1}{2}}\left[q+c\left(e^{Q}-1\right)\right]}  [W={\frac  {1}
      {2}}\left[q+c\left(e^{Q}-1\right)\right]]
with
         q =  a  i j k l    E  i j    E  k l    Q =  b  i j k l    E  i j    E
      k l     {\displaystyle q=a_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl}\qquad Q=b_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_
      {kl}}  [q=a_{{ijkl}}E_{{ij}}E_{{kl}}\qquad Q=b_{{ijkl}}E_{{ij}}E_{{kl}}]
quadratic forms of Green-Lagrange_strains      E  i j     {\displaystyle E_
{ij}}  [E_{{ij}}] and      a  i j k l     {\displaystyle a_{ijkl}}  [a_{
{ijkl}}],      b  i j k l     {\displaystyle b_{ijkl}}  [b_{{ijkl}}] and     c
{\displaystyle c}  [c] material constants.[7]     W   {\displaystyle W}  [W] is
the strain_energy_function per volume unit, which is the mechanical strain
energy for a given temperature.
*** Isotropic simplification[edit] ***
The Fung-model, simplified with isotropic hypothesis (same mechanical
properties in all directions). This written in respect of the principal
stretches (     &#x03BB;  i     {\displaystyle \lambda _{i}}  [\lambda _{i}]):
         W =   1 2    [  a (  &#x03BB;  1   2   +  &#x03BB;  2   2   +
      &#x03BB;  3   2   &#x2212; 3 ) + b  (   e  c (  &#x03BB;  1   2   +
      &#x03BB;  2   2   +  &#x03BB;  3   2   &#x2212; 3 )   &#x2212; 1  )   ]
      {\displaystyle W={\frac {1}{2}}\left[a(\lambda _{1}^{2}+\lambda _{2}^
      {2}+\lambda _{3}^{2}-3)+b\left(e^{c(\lambda _{1}^{2}+\lambda _{2}^
      {2}+\lambda _{3}^{2}-3)}-1\right)\right]}  [W={\frac  {1}{2}}\left[a
      (\lambda _{1}^{2}+\lambda _{2}^{2}+\lambda _{3}^{2}-3)+b\left(e^{{c
      (\lambda _{1}^{2}+\lambda _{2}^{2}+\lambda _{3}^{2}-3)}}-1\right)\right]]
      ,
where a, b and c are constants.
*** Simplification for small and big stretches[edit] ***
For small strains, the exponential term is very small, thus negligible.
         W =   1 2    a  i j k l    E  i j    E  k l     {\displaystyle W=
      {\frac {1}{2}}a_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl}}  [W={\frac  {1}{2}}a_{{ijkl}}E_{
      {ij}}E_{{kl}}]
On the other hand, the linear term is negligible when the analysis rely only on
big strains.
         W =   1 2   c  (   e   b  i j k l    E  i j    E  k l     &#x2212; 1
      )    {\displaystyle W={\frac {1}{2}}c\left(e^{b_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl}}-
      1\right)}  [W={\frac  {1}{2}}c\left(e^{{b_{{ijkl}}E_{{ij}}E_{{kl}}}}-
      1\right)]
**** Gent-elastic material[edit] ****

      &#x2212; 3   J  m     )   )    {\displaystyle W=-{\frac {\mu J_{m}}
      {2}}\ln \left(1-\left({\frac {\lambda _{1}^{2}+\lambda _{2}^{2}+\lambda _
      {3}^{2}-3}{J_{m}}}\right)\right)}  [W=-{\frac  {\mu J_{m}}{2}}\ln \left
      (1-\left({\frac  {\lambda _{1}^{2}+\lambda _{2}^{2}+\lambda _{3}^{2}-3}
      {J_{m}}}\right)\right)]
where     &#x03BC; > 0   {\displaystyle \mu >0}  [\mu >0] is the shear modulus
for infinitesimal strains and      J  m   > 0   {\displaystyle J_{m}>0}  [
{\displaystyle J_{m}>0}] is a stiffening parameter, associated with limiting
chain extensibility.[9] This constitutive model cannot be stretched in uni-
axial tension beyond a maximal stretch      J  m     {\displaystyle J_{m}}  [J_
{m}], which is the positive root of
          &#x03BB;  m   2   + 2  &#x03BB;  m   &#x2212;  J  m   &#x2212; 3 = 0
      {\displaystyle \lambda _{m}^{2}+2\lambda _{m}-J_{m}-3=0}  [\lambda _{m}^
      {2}+2\lambda _{m}-J_{m}-3=0]
***** Remodeling and growth[edit] *****
Soft tissues have the potential to grow and remodel reacting to chemical and
mechanical long term changes. The rate the fibroblasts produce tropocollagen is
proportional to these stimuli. Diseases, injuries and changes in the level of
mechanical load may induce remodeling. An example of this phenomenon is the
thickening of farmer's hands. The remodeling of connective tissues is well
known in bones by the Wolff's_law (bone_remodeling). Mechanobiology is the
science that study the relation between stress and growth at cellular level.[6]
Growth and remodeling have a major role in the cause of some common soft tissue
diseases, like arterial stenosis and aneurisms [10][11] and any soft tissue
fibrosis. Other instance of tissue remodeling is the thickening of the cardiac
muscle in response to the growth of blood_pressure detected by the arterial
wall.
***** Imaging techniques[edit] *****
There are certain issues that have to be kept in mind when choosing an imaging
technique for visualizing soft tissue ECM components. The accuracy of the image
analysis relies on the properties and the quality of the raw data and,
therefore, the choice of the imaging technique must be based upon issues such
as:
   1. Having an optimal resolution for the components of interest;
   2. Achieving high contrast of those components;
   3. Keeping the artifact count low;
   4. Having the option of volume data acquisition;
   5. Keeping the data volume low;
   6. Establishing an easy and reproducible setup for tissue analysis.
The collagen fibers are approximately 1-2 Î¼m thick. Thus, the resolution of
the imaging technique needs to be approximately 0.5 Î¼m. Some techniques allow
the direct acquisition of volume data while other need the slicing of the
specimen. In both cases, the volume that is extracted must be able to follow
the fiber bundles across the volume. High contrast makes segmentation easier,
especially when color information is available. In addition, the need for
fixation must also be addressed. It has been shown that soft tissue fixation in
formalin causes shrinkage, altering the structure of the original tissue. Some
typical values of contraction for different fixation are: formalin (5% - 10%),
alcohol (10%), bouin (<5%).[12]
