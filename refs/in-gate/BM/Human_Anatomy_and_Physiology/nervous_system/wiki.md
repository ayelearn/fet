The nervous system is a highly_complex part of an animal that coordinates its
actions and sensory information by transmitting signals to and from different
parts of its body. The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact
the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine_system to respond to such
events.[1] Nervous_tissue first arose in wormlike_organisms about 550 to 600
million years ago. In vertebrates it consists of two main parts, the central
nervous_system (CNS) and the peripheral_nervous_system (PNS). The CNS consists
of the brain and spinal_cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are
enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to every
other part of the body. Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called
motor or efferent nerves, while those nerves that transmit information from the
body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent. Spinal_nerves serve both
functions and are called mixed nerves. The PNS is divided into three separate
subsystems, the somatic, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Somatic nerves
mediate voluntary movement. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided
into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic
nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while
the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed
state. The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal
system. Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily.
Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial_nerves while those exiting
from the spinal cord are called spinal_nerves.
At the cellular level, the nervous system is defined by the presence of a
special type of cell, called the neuron, also known as a "nerve cell". Neurons
have special structures that allow them to send signals rapidly and precisely
to other cells. They send these signals in the form of electrochemical waves
traveling along thin fibers called axons, which cause chemicals called
neurotransmitters to be released at junctions called synapses. A cell that
receives a synaptic signal from a neuron may be excited, inhibited, or
otherwise modulated. The connections between neurons can form neural_pathways,
neural_circuits, and larger networks that generate an organism's perception of
the world and determine its behavior. Along with neurons, the nervous system
contains other specialized cells called glial_cells (or simply glia), which
provide structural and metabolic support.
Nervous systems are found in most multicellular animals, but vary greatly in
complexity.[2] The only multicellular animals that have no nervous system at
all are sponges, placozoans, and mesozoans, which have very simple body plans.
The nervous systems of the radially_symmetric organisms ctenophores (comb
jellies) and cnidarians (which include anemones, hydras, corals and jellyfish)
consist of a diffuse nerve_net. All other animal species, with the exception of
a few types of worm, have a nervous system containing a brain, a central cord
(or two cords running in parallel), and nerves radiating from the brain and
central cord. The size of the nervous system ranges from a few hundred cells in
the simplest worms, to around 300 billion cells in African elephants.[3]
The central nervous system functions to send signals from one cell to others,
or from one part of the body to others and to receive feedback. Malfunction of
the nervous system can occur as a result of genetic defects, physical damage
due to trauma or toxicity, infection or simply of ageing. The medical specialty
of neurology studies disorders of the nervous system and looks for
interventions that can prevent or treat them. In the peripheral nervous system,
the most common problem is the failure of nerve conduction, which can be due to
different causes including diabetic_neuropathy and demyelinating disorders such
as multiple_sclerosis and amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis. Neuroscience is the
field of science that focuses on the study of the nervous system.

***** Structure *****
The nervous system derives its name from nerves, which are cylindrical bundles
of fibers (the axons of neurons), that emanate from the brain and spinal_cord,
and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body.[4] Nerves are large
enough to have been recognized by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans,[5]
but their internal structure was not understood until it became possible to
examine them using a microscope.[6] The author Michael Nikoletseas wrote:[7]
     "It is difficult to believe that until approximately year 1900 it was
     not known that neurons are the basic units of the brain (Santiago
     RamÃ³n_y_Cajal). Equally surprising is the fact that the concept of
     chemical transmission in the brain was not known until around 1930
     (Henry_Hallett_Dale and Otto_Loewi). We began to understand the basic
     electrical phenomenon that neurons use in order to communicate among
     themselves, the action potential, in the 1950s (Alan_Lloyd_Hodgkin,
     Andrew_Huxley and John_Eccles). It was in the 1960s that we became
     aware of how basic neuronal networks code stimuli and thus basic
     concepts are possible (David_H._Hubel and Torsten_Wiesel). The
     molecular revolution swept across US universities in the 1980s. It
     was in the 1990s that molecular mechanisms of behavioral phenomena
     became widely known (Eric_Richard_Kandel)."
A microscopic examination shows that nerves consist primarily of axons, along
with different membranes that wrap around them and segregate them into
fascicles. The neurons that give rise to nerves do not lie entirely within the
nerves themselvesâtheir cell bodies reside within the brain, spinal_cord, or
peripheral ganglia.[4]
All animals more advanced than sponges have nervous systems. However, even
sponges, unicellular animals, and non-animals such as slime molds have cell-to-
cell signalling mechanisms that are precursors to those of neurons.[8] In
radially symmetric animals such as the jellyfish and hydra, the nervous system
consists of a nerve_net, a diffuse network of isolated cells.[9] In bilaterian
animals, which make up the great majority of existing species, the nervous
system has a common structure that originated early in the Ediacaran period,
over 550 million years ago.[10][11]
**** Cells ****
The nervous system contains two main categories or types of cells: neurons and
glial_cells.

The nervous system is defined by the presence of a special type of cellâthe
neuron (sometimes called "neurone" or "nerve cell").[4] Neurons can be
distinguished from other cells in a number of ways, but their most fundamental
property is that they communicate with other cells via synapses, which are
membrane-to-membrane junctions containing molecular machinery that allows rapid
transmission of signals, either electrical or chemical.[4] Many types of neuron
possess an axon, a protoplasmic protrusion that can extend to distant parts of
the body and make thousands of synaptic contacts;[12] axons typically extend
throughout the body in bundles called nerves.
Even in the nervous system of a single species such as humans, hundreds of
different types of neurons exist, with a wide variety of morphologies and
functions.[12] These include sensory_neurons that transmute physical stimuli
such as light and sound into neural signals, and motor_neurons that transmute
neural signals into activation of muscles or glands; however in many species
the great majority of neurons participate in the formation of centralized
structures (the brain and ganglia) and they receive all of their input from
other neurons and send their output to other neurons.[4]
*** Glial cells ***
Glial_cells (named from the Greek for "glue") are non-neuronal cells that
provide support and nutrition, maintain homeostasis, form myelin, and
participate in signal transmission in the nervous system.[13] In the human
brain, it is estimated that the total number of glia roughly equals the number
of neurons, although the proportions vary in different brain areas.[14] Among
the most important functions of glial cells are to support neurons and hold
them in place; to supply nutrients to neurons; to insulate neurons
electrically; to destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons; and to provide
guidance cues directing the axons of neurons to their targets.[13] A very
important type of glial cell (oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system,
and Schwann_cells in the peripheral nervous system) generates layers of a fatty
substance called myelin that wraps around axons and provides electrical
insulation which allows them to transmit action potentials much more rapidly
and efficiently. Recent findings indicate that glial cells, such as microglia
and astrocytes, serve as important resident immune cells within the central
nervous system.

brain

The nervous system of vertebrates (including humans) is divided into the
central_nervous_system (CNS) and the peripheral_nervous_system (PNS).[15]
The (CNS) is the major division, and consists of the brain and the spinal_cord.
[15] The spinal_canal contains the spinal cord, while the cranial_cavity
contains the brain. The CNS is enclosed and protected by the meninges, a three-
layered system of membranes, including a tough, leathery outer layer called the
dura_mater. The brain is also protected by the skull, and the spinal cord by
the vertebrae.
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is a collective term for the nervous system
structures that do not lie within the CNS.[16] The large majority of the axon
bundles called nerves are considered to belong to the PNS, even when the cell
bodies of the neurons to which they belong reside within the brain or spinal
cord. The PNS is divided into somatic and visceral parts. The somatic part
consists of the nerves that innervate the skin, joints, and muscles. The cell
bodies of somatic sensory neurons lie in dorsal_root_ganglia of the spinal
cord. The visceral part, also known as the autonomic nervous system, contains
neurons that innervate the internal organs, blood vessels, and glands. The
autonomic nervous system itself consists of two parts: the sympathetic_nervous
system and the parasympathetic_nervous_system. Some authors also include
sensory neurons whose cell bodies lie in the periphery (for senses such as
hearing) as part of the PNS; others, however, omit them.[17]
The vertebrate nervous system can also be divided into areas called grey_matter
("gray matter" in American spelling) and white_matter.[18] Grey matter (which
is only grey in preserved tissue, and is better described as pink or light
brown in living tissue) contains a high proportion of cell bodies of neurons.
White matter is composed mainly of myelinated axons, and takes its color from
the myelin. White matter includes all of the nerves, and much of the interior
of the brain and spinal cord. Grey matter is found in clusters of neurons in
the brain and spinal cord, and in cortical layers that line their surfaces.
There is an anatomical convention that a cluster of neurons in the brain or
spinal cord is called a nucleus, whereas a cluster of neurons in the periphery
is called a ganglion.[19] There are, however, a few exceptions to this rule,
notably including the part of the forebrain called the basal_ganglia.[20]
**** Comparative anatomy and evolution ****
Main article: Evolution_of_nervous_systems
*** Neural precursors in sponges ***
Sponges have no cells connected to each other by synaptic_junctions, that is,
no neurons, and therefore no nervous system. They do, however, have homologs of
many genes that play key roles in synaptic function. Recent studies have shown
that sponge cells express a group of proteins that cluster together to form a
structure resembling a postsynaptic_density (the signal-receiving part of a
synapse).[8] However, the function of this structure is currently unclear.
Although sponge cells do not show synaptic transmission, they do communicate
with each other via calcium waves and other impulses, which mediate some simple
actions such as whole-body contraction.[21]
*** Radiata ***
Jellyfish, comb_jellies, and related animals have diffuse nerve nets rather
than a central nervous system. In most jellyfish the nerve net is spread more
or less evenly across the body; in comb jellies it is concentrated near the
mouth. The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons, which pick up chemical,
tactile, and visual signals; motor neurons, which can activate contractions of
the body wall; and intermediate neurons, which detect patterns of activity in
the sensory neurons and, in response, send signals to groups of motor neurons.
In some cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete
ganglia.[9]
The development of the nervous system in radiata is relatively unstructured.
Unlike bilaterians, radiata only have two primordial cell layers, endoderm and
ectoderm. Neurons are generated from a special set of ectodermal precursor
cells, which also serve as precursors for every other ectodermal cell type.[22]
*** Bilateria ***

Nervous system of a bilaterian animal, in the form of a nerve cord with
segmental enlargements, and a "brain" at the front
The vast majority of existing animals are bilaterians, meaning animals with
left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other. All
bilateria are thought to have descended from a common wormlike ancestor that
appeared in the Ediacaran period, 550â600 million years ago.[10] The
fundamental bilaterian body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running
from mouth to anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a "ganglion") for
each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the
"brain".
Area of the human body surface innervated by each spinal nerve
Even mammals, including humans, show the segmented bilaterian body plan at the
level of the nervous system. The spinal cord contains a series of segmental
ganglia, each giving rise to motor and sensory nerves that innervate a portion
of the body surface and underlying musculature. On the limbs, the layout of the
innervation pattern is complex, but on the trunk it gives rise to a series of
narrow bands. The top three segments belong to the brain, giving rise to the
forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.[23]
Bilaterians can be divided, based on events that occur very early in embryonic
development, into two groups (superphyla) called protostomes and deuterostomes.
[24] Deuterostomes include vertebrates as well as echinoderms, hemichordates
(mainly acorn worms), and Xenoturbellidans.[25] Protostomes, the more diverse
group, include arthropods, molluscs, and numerous types of worms. There is a
basic difference between the two groups in the placement of the nervous system
within the body: protostomes possess a nerve cord on the ventral (usually
bottom) side of the body, whereas in deuterostomes the nerve cord is on the
dorsal (usually top) side. In fact, numerous aspects of the body are inverted
between the two groups, including the expression patterns of several genes that
show dorsal-to-ventral gradients. Most anatomists now consider that the bodies
of protostomes and deuterostomes are "flipped over" with respect to each other,
a hypothesis that was first proposed by Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire for insects in
comparison to vertebrates. Thus insects, for example, have nerve cords that run
along the ventral midline of the body, while all vertebrates have spinal cords
that run along the dorsal midline.[26]
*** Worms ***
Earthworm nervous system. Top: side view of the front of the worm. Bottom:
nervous system in isolation, viewed from above
Worms are the simplest bilaterian animals, and reveal the basic structure of
the bilaterian nervous system in the most straightforward way. As an example,
earthworms have dual nerve_cords running along the length of the body and
merging at the tail and the mouth. These nerve cords are connected by
transverse nerves like the rungs of a ladder. These transverse nerves help
coordinate the two sides of the animal. Two ganglia at the head (the "nerve
ring") end function similar to a simple brain. Photoreceptors on the animal's
eyespots provide sensory information on light and dark.[27]
The nervous system of one very small roundworm, the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans, has been completely mapped out in a connectome including its synapses.
Every neuron and its cellular_lineage has been recorded and most, if not all,
of the neural connections are known. In this species, the nervous system is
sexually_dimorphic; the nervous systems of the two sexes, males and female
hermaphrodites, have different numbers of neurons and groups of neurons that
perform sex-specific functions. In C. elegans, males have exactly 383 neurons,
while hermaphrodites have exactly 302 neurons.[28]
*** Arthropods ***
Internal anatomy of a spider, showing the nervous system in blue
Arthropods, such as insects and crustaceans, have a nervous system made up of a
series of ganglia, connected by a ventral_nerve_cord made up of two parallel
connectives running along the length of the belly.[29] Typically, each body
segment has one ganglion on each side, though some ganglia are fused to form
the brain and other large ganglia. The head segment contains the brain, also
known as the supraesophageal_ganglion. In the insect_nervous_system, the brain
is anatomically divided into the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum, and
tritocerebrum. Immediately behind the brain is the subesophageal_ganglion,
which is composed of three pairs of fused ganglia. It controls the mouthparts,
the salivary_glands and certain muscles. Many arthropods have well-developed
sensory organs, including compound_eyes for vision and antennae for olfaction
and pheromone sensation. The sensory information from these organs is processed
by the brain.
In insects, many neurons have cell bodies that are positioned at the edge of
the brain and are electrically passiveâthe cell bodies serve only to provide
metabolic support and do not participate in signalling. A protoplasmic fiber
runs from the cell body and branches profusely, with some parts transmitting
signals and other parts receiving signals. Thus, most parts of the insect_brain
have passive cell bodies arranged around the periphery, while the neural signal
processing takes place in a tangle of protoplasmic fibers called neuropil, in
the interior.[30]
*** "Identified" neurons ***
A neuron is called identified if it has properties that distinguish it from
every other neuron in the same animalâproperties such as location,
neurotransmitter, gene expression pattern, and connectivityâand if every
individual organism belonging to the same species has one and only one neuron
with the same set of properties.[31] In vertebrate nervous systems very few
neurons are "identified" in this senseâin humans, there are believed to be
noneâbut in simpler nervous systems, some or all neurons may be thus unique.
In the roundworm C._elegans, whose nervous system is the most thoroughly
described of any animal's, every neuron in the body is uniquely identifiable,
with the same location and the same connections in every individual worm. One
notable consequence of this fact is that the form of the C. elegans nervous
system is completely specified by the genome, with no experience-dependent
plasticity.[28]
The brains of many molluscs and insects also contain substantial numbers of
identified neurons.[31] In vertebrates, the best known identified neurons are
the gigantic Mauthner_cells of fish.[32] Every fish has two Mauthner cells,
located in the bottom part of the brainstem, one on the left side and one on
the right. Each Mauthner cell has an axon that crosses over, innervating
neurons at the same brain level and then travelling down through the spinal
cord, making numerous connections as it goes. The synapses generated by a
Mauthner cell are so powerful that a single action potential gives rise to a
major behavioral response: within milliseconds the fish curves its body into a
C-shape, then straightens, thereby propelling itself rapidly forward.
Functionally this is a fast escape response, triggered most easily by a strong
sound wave or pressure wave impinging on the lateral line organ of the fish.
Mauthner cells are not the only identified neurons in fishâthere are about 20
more types, including pairs of "Mauthner cell analogs" in each spinal segmental
nucleus. Although a Mauthner cell is capable of bringing about an escape
response individually, in the context of ordinary behavior other types of cells
usually contribute to shaping the amplitude and direction of the response.
Mauthner cells have been described as command_neurons. A command neuron is a
special type of identified neuron, defined as a neuron that is capable of
driving a specific behavior individually.[33] Such neurons appear most commonly
in the fast escape systems of various speciesâthe squid_giant_axon and squid
giant_synapse, used for pioneering experiments in neurophysiology because of
their enormous size, both participate in the fast escape circuit of the squid.
The concept of a command neuron has, however, become controversial, because of
studies showing that some neurons that initially appeared to fit the
description were really only capable of evoking a response in a limited set of
circumstances.[34]
***** Function *****
At the most basic level, the function of the nervous system is to send signals
from one cell to others, or from one part of the body to others. There are
multiple ways that a cell can send signals to other cells. One is by releasing
chemicals called hormones into the internal circulation, so that they can
diffuse to distant sites. In contrast to this "broadcast" mode of signaling,
the nervous system provides "point-to-point" signalsâneurons project their
axons to specific target areas and make synaptic connections with specific
target cells.[35] Thus, neural signaling is capable of a much higher level of
specificity than hormonal signaling. It is also much faster: the fastest nerve
signals travel at speeds that exceed 100 meters per second.
At a more integrative level, the primary function of the nervous system is to
control the body.[4] It does this by extracting information from the
environment using sensory receptors, sending signals that encode this
information into the central nervous system, processing the information to
determine an appropriate response, and sending output signals to muscles or
glands to activate the response. The evolution of a complex nervous system has
made it possible for various animal species to have advanced perception
abilities such as vision, complex social interactions, rapid coordination of
organ systems, and integrated processing of concurrent signals. In humans, the
sophistication of the nervous system makes it possible to have language,
abstract representation of concepts, transmission of culture, and many other
features of human society that would not exist without the human brain.
**** Neurons and synapses ****
Major elements in synaptic transmission. An electrochemical wave called an
action_potential travels along the axon of a neuron. When the wave reaches a
synapse, it provokes release of a small amount of neurotransmitter molecules,
which bind to chemical receptor molecules located in the membrane of the target
cell.
Most neurons send signals via their axons, although some types are capable of
dendrite-to-dendrite communication. (In fact, the types of neurons called
amacrine_cells have no axons, and communicate only via their dendrites.) Neural
signals propagate along an axon in the form of electrochemical waves called
action_potentials, which produce cell-to-cell signals at points where axon
terminals make synaptic contact with other cells.[36]
Synapses may be electrical or chemical. Electrical_synapses make direct
electrical connections between neurons,[37] but chemical_synapses are much more
common, and much more diverse in function.[38] At a chemical synapse, the cell
that sends signals is called presynaptic, and the cell that receives signals is
called postsynaptic. Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full of
molecular machinery that carries out the signalling process. The presynaptic
area contains large numbers of tiny spherical vessels called synaptic_vesicles,
packed with neurotransmitter chemicals.[36] When the presynaptic terminal is
electrically stimulated, an array of molecules embedded in the membrane are
activated, and cause the contents of the vesicles to be released into the
narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, called the
synaptic_cleft. The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors embedded in the
postsynaptic membrane, causing them to enter an activated state.[38] Depending
on the type of receptor, the resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be
excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory in more complex ways. For example,
release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic contact between a
motor_neuron and a muscle_cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle cell.
[39] The entire synaptic transmission process takes only a fraction of a
millisecond, although the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much longer
(even indefinitely, in cases where the synaptic signal leads to the formation
of a memory_trace).[12]

There are literally hundreds of different types of synapses. In fact, there are
over a hundred known neurotransmitters, and many of them have multiple types of
receptors.[40] Many synapses use more than one neurotransmitterâa common
arrangement is for a synapse to use one fast-acting small-molecule
neurotransmitter such as glutamate or GABA, along with one or more peptide
neurotransmitters that play slower-acting modulatory roles. Molecular
neuroscientists generally divide receptors into two broad groups: chemically
gated_ion_channels and second_messenger_systems. When a chemically gated ion
channel is activated, it forms a passage that allows specific types of ions to
flow across the membrane. Depending on the type of ion, the effect on the
target cell may be excitatory or inhibitory. When a second messenger system is
activated, it starts a cascade of molecular interactions inside the target
cell, which may ultimately produce a wide variety of complex effects, such as
increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the cell to stimuli, or even
altering gene_transcription.
According to a rule called Dale's_principle, which has only a few known
exceptions, a neuron releases the same neurotransmitters at all of its
synapses.[41] This does not mean, though, that a neuron exerts the same effect
on all of its targets, because the effect of a synapse depends not on the
neurotransmitter, but on the receptors that it activates.[38] Because different
targets can (and frequently do) use different types of receptors, it is
possible for a neuron to have excitatory effects on one set of target cells,
inhibitory effects on others, and complex modulatory effects on others still.
Nevertheless, it happens that the two most widely used neurotransmitters,
glutamate and GABA, each have largely consistent effects. Glutamate has several
widely occurring types of receptors, but all of them are excitatory or
modulatory. Similarly, GABA has several widely occurring receptor types, but
all of them are inhibitory.[42] Because of this consistency, glutamatergic
cells are frequently referred to as "excitatory neurons", and GABAergic cells
as "inhibitory neurons". Strictly speaking, this is an abuse of
terminologyâit is the receptors that are excitatory and inhibitory, not the
neuronsâbut it is commonly seen even in scholarly publications.
One very important subset of synapses are capable of forming memory_traces by
means of long-lasting activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength.[43] The
best-known form of neural memory is a process called long-term_potentiation
(abbreviated LTP), which operates at synapses that use the neurotransmitter
glutamate acting on a special type of receptor known as the NMDA_receptor.[44]
The NMDA receptor has an "associative" property: if the two cells involved in
the synapse are both activated at approximately the same time, a channel opens
that permits calcium to flow into the target cell.[45] The calcium entry
initiates a second messenger cascade that ultimately leads to an increase in
the number of glutamate receptors in the target cell, thereby increasing the
effective strength of the synapse. This change in strength can last for weeks
or longer. Since the discovery of LTP in 1973, many other types of synaptic
memory traces have been found, involving increases or decreases in synaptic
strength that are induced by varying conditions, and last for variable periods
of time.[44] The reward_system, that reinforces desired behaviour for example,
depends on a variant form of LTP that is conditioned on an extra input coming
from a reward-signalling pathway that uses dopamine as neurotransmitter.[46]
All these forms of synaptic modifiability, taken collectively, give rise to
neural_plasticity, that is, to a capability for the nervous system to adapt
itself to variations in the environment.
**** Neural circuits and systems ****
The basic neuronal function of sending signals to other cells includes a
capability for neurons to exchange signals with each other. Networks formed by
interconnected groups of neurons are capable of a wide variety of functions,
including feature detection, pattern generation and timing,[47] and there are
seen to be countless types of information processing possible. Warren_McCulloch
and Walter_Pitts showed in 1943 that even artificial_neural_networks formed
from a greatly simplified mathematical abstraction of a neuron are capable of
universal_computation.[48]

Historically, for many years the predominant view of the function of the
nervous system was as a stimulus-response associator.[49] In this conception,
neural processing begins with stimuli that activate sensory neurons, producing
signals that propagate through chains of connections in the spinal cord and
brain, giving rise eventually to activation of motor neurons and thereby to
muscle contraction, i.e., to overt responses. Descartes believed that all of
the behaviors of animals, and most of the behaviors of humans, could be
explained in terms of stimulus-response circuits, although he also believed
that higher cognitive functions such as language were not capable of being
explained mechanistically.[50] Charles_Sherrington, in his influential 1906
book The Integrative Action of the Nervous System,[49] developed the concept of
stimulus-response mechanisms in much more detail, and Behaviorism, the school
of thought that dominated Psychology through the middle of the 20th century,
attempted to explain every aspect of human behavior in stimulus-response terms.
[51]
However, experimental studies of electrophysiology, beginning in the early 20th
century and reaching high productivity by the 1940s, showed that the nervous
system contains many mechanisms for generating patterns of activity
intrinsically, without requiring an external stimulus.[52] Neurons were found
to be capable of producing regular sequences of action potentials, or sequences
of bursts, even in complete isolation.[53] When intrinsically active neurons
are connected to each other in complex circuits, the possibilities for
generating intricate temporal patterns become far more extensive.[47] A modern
conception views the function of the nervous system partly in terms of
stimulus-response chains, and partly in terms of intrinsically generated
activity patternsâboth types of activity interact with each other to generate
the full repertoire of behavior.[54]
*** Reflexes and other stimulus-response circuits ***
Simplified schema of basic nervous system function: signals are picked up by
sensory receptors and sent to the spinal cord and brain, where processing
occurs that results in signals sent back to the spinal cord and then out to
motor neurons
The simplest type of neural circuit is a reflex_arc, which begins with a
sensory input and ends with a motor output, passing through a sequence of
neurons connected in series.[55] This can be shown in the "withdrawal reflex"
causing a hand to jerk back after a hot stove is touched. The circuit begins
with sensory_receptors in the skin that are activated by harmful levels of
heat: a special type of molecular structure embedded in the membrane causes
heat to change the electrical field across the membrane. If the change in
electrical potential is large enough to pass the given threshold, it evokes an
action potential, which is transmitted along the axon of the receptor cell,
into the spinal cord. There the axon makes excitatory synaptic contacts with
other cells, some of which project (send axonal output) to the same region of
the spinal cord, others projecting into the brain. One target is a set of
spinal interneurons that project to motor neurons controlling the arm muscles.
The interneurons excite the motor neurons, and if the excitation is strong
enough, some of the motor neurons generate action potentials, which travel down
their axons to the point where they make excitatory synaptic contacts with
muscle cells. The excitatory signals induce contraction of the muscle cells,
which causes the joint angles in the arm to change, pulling the arm away.
In reality, this straightforward schema is subject to numerous complications.
[55] Although for the simplest reflexes there are short neural paths from
sensory neuron to motor neuron, there are also other nearby neurons that
participate in the circuit and modulate the response. Furthermore, there are
projections from the brain to the spinal cord that are capable of enhancing or
inhibiting the reflex.
Although the simplest reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely
within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the
brain.[56] For example, when an object in the periphery of the visual field
moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are
initiated. The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the
final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not all
that different from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are
completely different. Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the
visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving
the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum,
and several brainstem nuclei. These areas perform signal-processing functions
that include feature_detection, perceptual analysis, memory_recall, decision-
making, and motor_planning.[57]
Feature_detection is the ability to extract biologically relevant information
from combinations of sensory signals.[58] In the visual_system, for example,
sensory receptors in the retina of the eye are only individually capable of
detecting "points of light" in the outside world.[59] Second-level visual
neurons receive input from groups of primary receptors, higher-level neurons
receive input from groups of second-level neurons, and so on, forming a
hierarchy of processing stages. At each stage, important information is
extracted from the signal ensemble and unimportant information is discarded. By
the end of the process, input signals representing "points of light" have been
transformed into a neural representation of objects in the surrounding world
and their properties. The most sophisticated sensory processing occurs inside
the brain, but complex feature extraction also takes place in the spinal cord
and in peripheral sensory organs such as the retina.
*** Intrinsic pattern generation ***
Although stimulus-response mechanisms are the easiest to understand, the
nervous system is also capable of controlling the body in ways that do not
require an external stimulus, by means of internally generated rhythms of
activity. Because of the variety of voltage-sensitive ion channels that can be
embedded in the membrane of a neuron, many types of neurons are capable, even
in isolation, of generating rhythmic sequences of action potentials, or
rhythmic alternations between high-rate bursting and quiescence. When neurons
that are intrinsically rhythmic are connected to each other by excitatory or
inhibitory synapses, the resulting networks are capable of a wide variety of
dynamical behaviors, including attractor dynamics, periodicity, and even chaos.
A network of neurons that uses its internal structure to generate temporally
structured output, without requiring a corresponding temporally structured
stimulus, is called a central_pattern_generator.
Internal pattern generation operates on a wide range of time scales, from
milliseconds to hours or longer. One of the most important types of temporal
pattern is circadian_rhythmicityâthat is, rhythmicity with a period of
approximately 24 hours. All animals that have been studied show circadian
fluctuations in neural activity, which control circadian alternations in
behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental studies dating from the
1990s have shown that circadian rhythms are generated by a "genetic clock"
consisting of a special set of genes whose expression level rises and falls
over the course of the day. Animals as diverse as insects and vertebrates share
a similar genetic clock system. The circadian clock is influenced by light but
continues to operate even when light levels are held constant and no other
external time-of-day cues are available. The clock genes are expressed in many
parts of the nervous system as well as many peripheral organs, but in mammals,
all of these "tissue clocks" are kept in synchrony by signals that emanate from
a master timekeeper in a tiny part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic
nucleus.
**** Mirror neurons ****
A mirror_neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the
animal observes the same action performed by another.[60][61][62] Thus, the
neuron "mirrors" the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself
acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate species.[63] Birds
have been shown to have imitative resonance behaviors and neurological evidence
suggests the presence of some form of mirroring system.[63][64] In humans,
brain activity consistent with that of mirror neurons has been found in the
premotor_cortex, the supplementary_motor_area, the primary_somatosensory_cortex
and the inferior_parietal_cortex.[65] The function of the mirror system is a
subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive neuroscience and
cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological
mechanism for the perception/action coupling (see the common_coding_theory).
[62] They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the
actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some
researchers also speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions,
and thus contribute to theory_of_mind skills,[66][67] while others relate
mirror neurons to language abilities.[68] However, to date, no widely accepted
neural or computational models have been put forward to describe how mirror
neuron activity supports cognitive functions such as imitation.[69] There are
neuroscientists who caution that the claims being made for the role of mirror
neurons are not supported by adequate research.[70][71]
***** Development *****
Main article: Development_of_the_nervous_system
In vertebrates, landmarks of embryonic neural_development include the birth and
differentiation of neurons from stem_cell precursors, the migration of immature
neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions,
outgrowth of axons from neurons and guidance of the motile growth_cone through
the embryo towards postsynaptic partners, the generation of synapses between
these axons and their postsynaptic partners, and finally the lifelong changes
in synapses which are thought to underlie learning and memory.[72]
All bilaterian animals at an early stage of development form a gastrula, which
is polarized, with one end called the animal_pole and the other the vegetal
pole. The gastrula has the shape of a disk with three layers of cells, an inner
layer called the endoderm, which gives rise to the lining of most internal
organs, a middle layer called the mesoderm, which gives rise to the bones and
muscles, and an outer layer called the ectoderm, which gives rise to the skin
and nervous system.[73]
   Human embryo, showing neural groove Four stages in the development of the
                                       neural tube in the human embryo
In vertebrates, the first sign of the nervous system is the appearance of a
thin strip of cells along the center of the back, called the neural_plate. The
inner portion of the neural plate (along the midline) is destined to become the
central_nervous_system (CNS), the outer portion the peripheral_nervous_system
(PNS). As development proceeds, a fold called the neural_groove appears along
the midline. This fold deepens, and then closes up at the top. At this point
the future CNS appears as a cylindrical structure called the neural_tube,
whereas the future PNS appears as two strips of tissue called the neural_crest,
running lengthwise above the neural tube. The sequence of stages from neural
plate to neural tube and neural crest is known as neurulation.
In the early 20th century, a set of famous experiments by Hans Spemann and
Hilde Mangold showed that the formation of nervous tissue is "induced" by
signals from a group of mesodermal cells called the organizer region.[72] For
decades, though, the nature of the induction process defeated every attempt to
figure it out, until finally it was resolved by genetic approaches in the
1990s. Induction of neural tissue requires inhibition of the gene for a so-
called bone_morphogenetic_protein, or BMP. Specifically the protein BMP4
appears to be involved. Two proteins called Noggin and Chordin, both secreted
by the mesoderm, are capable of inhibiting BMP4 and thereby inducing ectoderm
to turn into neural tissue. It appears that a similar molecular mechanism is
involved for widely disparate types of animals, including arthropods as well as
vertebrates. In some animals, however, another type of molecule called
Fibroblast_Growth_Factor or FGF may also play an important role in induction.
Induction of neural tissues causes formation of neural precursor cells, called
neuroblasts.[74] In drosophila, neuroblasts divide asymmetrically, so that one
product is a "ganglion mother cell" (GMC), and the other is a neuroblast. A GMC
divides once, to give rise to either a pair of neurons or a pair of glial
cells. In all, a neuroblast is capable of generating an indefinite number of
neurons or glia.
As shown in a 2008 study, one factor common to all bilateral organisms
(including humans) is a family of secreted signaling_molecules called
neurotrophins which regulate the growth and survival of neurons.[75] Zhu et al.
identified DNT1, the first neurotrophin found in flies. DNT1 shares structural
similarity with all known neurotrophins and is a key factor in the fate of
neurons in Drosophila. Because neurotrophins have now been identified in both
vertebrate and invertebrates, this evidence suggests that neurotrophins were
present in an ancestor common to bilateral organisms and may represent a common
mechanism for nervous system formation.

Layers protecting the brain and spinal cord.
The central nervous system is protected by major physical and chemical
barriers. Physically, the brain and spinal cord are surrounded by tough
meningeal membranes, and enclosed in the bones of the skull and vertebral
column, which combine to form a strong physical shield. Chemically, the brain
and spinal cord are isolated by the bloodâbrain_barrier, which prevents most
types of chemicals from moving from the bloodstream into the interior of the
CNS. These protections make the CNS less susceptible in many ways than the PNS;
the flip side, however, is that damage to the CNS tends to have more serious
consequences.
Although nerves tend to lie deep under the skin except in a few places such as
the ulnar_nerve near the elbow joint, they are still relatively exposed to
physical damage, which can cause pain, loss of sensation, or loss of muscle
control. Damage to nerves can also be caused by swelling or bruises at places
where a nerve passes through a tight bony channel, as happens in carpal_tunnel
syndrome. If a nerve is completely transected, it will often regenerate, but
for long nerves this process may take months to complete. In addition to
physical damage, peripheral_neuropathy may be caused by many other medical
problems, including genetic conditions, metabolic conditions such as diabetes,
inflammatory conditions such as GuillainâBarrÃ©_syndrome, vitamin deficiency,
infectious diseases such as leprosy or shingles, or poisoning by toxins such as
heavy metals. Many cases have no cause that can be identified, and are referred
to as idiopathic. It is also possible for nerves to lose function temporarily,
resulting in numbness as stiffnessâcommon causes include mechanical pressure,
a drop in temperature, or chemical interactions with local_anesthetic drugs
such as lidocaine.
Physical damage to the spinal cord may result in loss_of_sensation_or_movement.
If an injury to the spine produces nothing worse than swelling, the symptoms
may be transient, but if nerve fibers in the spine are actually destroyed, the
loss of function is usually permanent. Experimental studies have shown that
spinal nerve fibers attempt to regrow in the same way as nerve fibers, but in
the spinal cord, tissue destruction usually produces scar tissue that cannot be
penetrated by the regrowing nerves.
