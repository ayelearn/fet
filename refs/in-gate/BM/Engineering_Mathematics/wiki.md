From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Engineering mathematics is a branch of applied_mathematics concerning
mathematical_methods_and_techniques that are typically used in engineering and
industry. Along with fields like engineering_physics and engineering_geology,
both of which may belong in the wider category engineering_science, engineering
mathematics is an interdisciplinary subject motivated by engineers' needs both
for practical, theoretical and other considerations outwith their
specialization, and to deal with constraints to be effective in their work.
***** Description[edit] *****
Historically, engineering mathematics consisted mostly of applied_analysis,
most notably: differential_equations; real and complex_analysis (including
vector and tensor_analysis); approximation_theory (broadly construed, to
include asymptotic, variational, and perturbative_methods, representations,
numerical_analysis); Fourier_analysis; potential_theory; as well as linear
algebra and applied probability, outside of analysis. These areas of
mathematics were intimately tied to the development of Newtonian_physics, and
the mathematical_physics of that period. This history also left a legacy: until
the early 20th century subjects such as classical_mechanics were often taught
in applied mathematics departments at American universities, and fluid
mechanics may still be taught in (applied) mathematics as well as engineering
departments.[1]
The success of modern numerical computer methods and software has led to the
emergence of computational_mathematics, computational_science, and
computational_engineering (the last two are sometimes lumped together and
abbreviated as CS&E), which occasionally use high-performance_computing for the
simulation of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and
engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary fields, but are also
of interest to engineering mathematics.[2]
Specialized branches include engineering_optimization and engineering
statistics.
Engineering mathematics in tertiary_education typically consists of
mathematical methods and models courses.[3]
