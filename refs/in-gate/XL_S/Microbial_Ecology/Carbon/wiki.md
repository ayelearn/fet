Carbon (from Latin: carbo "coal") is a chemical_element with the symbol C and
atomic_number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentâmaking four electrons
available to form covalent chemical_bonds. It belongs to group 14 of the
periodic table.[13] Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable,
while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years.
[14] Carbon is one of the few_elements_known_since_antiquity.[15]
Carbon is the 15th most_abundant_element_in_the_Earth's_crust, and the fourth
most_abundant_element_in_the_universe_by_mass after hydrogen, helium, and
oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic_compounds, and its
unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on
Earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all_known_life. It
is the second most abundant element in the human_body by mass (about 18.5%)
after oxygen.[16]
The atoms of carbon can bond together in different ways, termed allotropes_of
carbon. The best known are graphite, diamond, and amorphous_carbon.[17] The
physical_properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For
example, graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent.
Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the
Greek verb "Î³ÏÎ¬ÏÎµÎ¹Î½" which means "to write"), while diamond is the
hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical
conductor while diamond has a low electrical_conductivity. Under normal
conditions, diamond, carbon_nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal
conductivities of all_known_materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under
normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically_stable form
at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require
high temperature to react even with oxygen.
The most common oxidation_state of carbon in inorganic_compounds is +4, while
+2 is found in carbon_monoxide and transition_metal carbonyl complexes. The
largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon
dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat,
oil, and methane_clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, more than
any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,[18] and
yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible
compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been
referred to as the "king of the elements".[19]

Theoretically predicted phase diagram of carbon
The allotropes_of_carbon include graphite, one of the softest known substances,
and diamond, the hardest naturally occurring substance. It bonds readily with
other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming
multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable multivalent atoms. Carbon is known
to form almost ten million different compounds, a large majority of all
chemical_compounds.[18] Carbon also has the highest sublimation point of all
elements. At atmospheric_pressure it has no melting point, as its triple_point
is at 10.8Â±0.2 MPa and 4,600 Â± 300 K (4,330 Â± 300 Â°C; 7,820 Â± 540 Â°F),[2]
[3] so it sublimes at about 3,900 K (3,630 Â°C; 6,560 Â°F).[20][21] Graphite is
much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more
thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi_system is much more vulnerable
to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric
acid at standard conditions to mellitic_acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the
hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.[22]
Carbon sublimes in a carbon arc, which has a temperature of about 5800 K
(5,530 Â°C or 9,980 Â°F). Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon
remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest-melting-point metals such
as tungsten or rhenium. Although thermodynamically prone to oxidation, carbon
resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as iron and copper, which
are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.
Carbon is the sixth element, with a ground-state electron_configuration of
1s22s22p2, of which the four outer electrons are valence_electrons. Its first
four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7 kJ/mol, are much
higher than those of the heavier group-14 elements. The electronegativity of
carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group-14 elements
(1.8â1.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals, as well as some of the
second- and third-row transition_metals. Carbon's covalent_radii are normally
taken as 77.2 pm (CâC), 66.7 pm (C=C) and 60.3 pm (Câ¡C), although these may
vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to. In
general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher
bond order.[23]
Carbon compounds form the basis of all known life on Earth, and the
carbonânitrogen_cycle provides some of the energy produced by the Sun and
other stars. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most
forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At
standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers.
It does not react with sulfuric_acid, hydrochloric_acid, chlorine or any
alkalis. At elevated temperatures, carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon
oxides and will rob oxygen from metal oxides to leave the elemental metal. This
exothermic_reaction is used in the iron and steel industry to smelt iron and to
control the carbon content of steel:
      Fe
      3O
      4 + 4 C(s) â 3 Fe(s) + 4 CO(g)
Carbon monoxide can be recycled to smelt even more iron:

      3O
      4 + 4 CO(g) â 3 Fe(s) + 4 CO
      2(g)
with sulfur to form carbon_disulfide and with steam in the coal-gas reaction:
      C(s) + H2O(g) â CO(g) + H2(g).
Carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic
carbides, such as the iron carbide cementite in steel and tungsten_carbide,
widely used as an abrasive and for making hard tips for cutting tools.

**** Allotropes ****
Main article: Allotropes_of_carbon
Atomic_carbon is a very short-lived species and, therefore, carbon is
stabilized in various multi-atomic structures with different molecular
configurations called allotropes. The three relatively well-known allotropes of
carbon are amorphous_carbon, graphite, and diamond. Once considered exotic,
fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include
buckyballs,[29][30] carbon_nanotubes,[31] carbon_nanobuds[32] and nanofibers.
[33][34] Several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered, such as
lonsdaleite,[35] glassy_carbon,[36] carbon_nanofoam[37] and linear_acetylenic
carbon (carbyne).[38]
Graphene is a two-dimensional sheet of carbon with the atoms arranged in a
hexagonal lattice. As of 2009, graphene appears to be the strongest material
ever tested.[39] The process of separating it from graphite will require some
further technological development before it is economical for industrial
processes.[40] If successful, graphene could be used in the construction of a
space_elevator. It could also be used to safely store hydrogen for use in a
hydrogen based engine in cars.[41]
A large sample of glassy carbon
The amorphous form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline,
irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is
present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as
charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated_carbon. At normal pressures, carbon
takes the form of graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three
others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in
aromatic_hydrocarbons.[42] The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the
resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van_der_Waals
forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the
sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of
the outer electrons of each atom to form a Ï-cloud, graphite conducts
electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently_bonded sheet. This
results in a lower bulk electrical_conductivity for carbon than for most
metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of
graphite over diamond at room temperature.
Some allotropes of carbon: a) diamond; b) graphite; c) lonsdaleite; dâf)
fullerenes (C60, C540, C70); g) amorphous_carbon; h) carbon_nanotube
At very high pressures, carbon forms the more compact allotrope, diamond,
having nearly twice the density of graphite. Here, each atom is bonded
tetrahedrally to four others, forming a 3-dimensional network of puckered six-
membered rings of atoms. Diamond has the same cubic_structure as silicon and
germanium, and because of the strength of the carbon-carbon bonds, it is the
hardest naturally occurring substance measured by resistance_to_scratching.
Contrary to the popular belief that "diamonds are forever", they are
thermodynamically unstable (ÎfGÂ°(diamond, 298 K) = 2.9 kJ/mol[43]) under
normal conditions (298 K, 105 Pa) and transform into graphite.[17] Due to a
high activation energy barrier, the transition into graphite is so slow at
normal temperature that it is unnoticeable. The bottom left corner of the phase
diagram for carbon has not been scrutinized experimentally. However, a recent
computational study employing density_functional_theory methods reached the
conclusion that as T â 0 K and p â 0 Pa, diamond becomes more stable than
graphite by approximately 1.1 kJ/mol.[44] Under some conditions, carbon
crystallizes as lonsdaleite, a hexagonal crystal lattice with all atoms
covalently bonded and properties similar to those of diamond.[35]
Fullerenes are a synthetic crystalline formation with a graphite-like
structure, but in place of flat hexagonal_cells only, some of the cells of
which fullerenes are formed may be pentagons, nonplanar hexagons, or even
heptagons of carbon atoms. The sheets are thus warped into spheres, ellipses,
or cylinders. The properties of fullerenes (split into buckyballs, buckytubes,
and nanobuds) have not yet been fully analyzed and represent an intense area of
research in nanomaterials. The names fullerene and buckyball are given after
Richard_Buckminster_Fuller, popularizer of geodesic_domes, which resemble the
structure of fullerenes. The buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed
completely of carbon bonded trigonally, forming spheroids (the best-known and
simplest is the soccerball-shaped C60 buckminsterfullerene).[29] Carbon
nanotubes (buckytubes) are structurally similar to buckyballs, except that each
atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow cylinder.[30]
[31] Nanobuds were first reported in 2007 and are hybrid buckytube/buckyball
materials (buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube)
that combine the properties of both in a single structure.[32]
Of the other discovered allotropes, carbon_nanofoam is a ferromagnetic
allotrope discovered in 1997. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of
carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the
atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the
lightest known solids, with a density of about 2 kg/m3.[45] Similarly, glassy
carbon contains a high proportion of closed porosity,[36] but contrary to
normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, but
have a more random arrangement. Linear_acetylenic_carbon[38] has the chemical
structure[38] â(C:::C)nâ. Carbon in this modification is linear with sp
orbital_hybridization, and is a polymer with alternating single and triple
bonds. This carbyne is of considerable interest to nanotechnology as its
Young's_modulus is 40 times that of the hardest known material â diamond.[46]
In 2015, a team at the North_Carolina_State_University announced the
development of another allotrope they have dubbed Q-carbon, created by a high
energy low duration laser pulse on amorphous carbon dust. Q-carbon is reported
to exhibit ferromagnetism, fluorescence, and a hardness superior to diamonds.

Carbon is the fourth_most_abundant_chemical_element in the observable_universe
by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun,
stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets.[48] Some meteorites
contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar_system was still a
protoplanetary_disk.[49] Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense
pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.[50]
In 2014 NASA announced a greatly_upgraded_database for tracking polycyclic
aromatic_hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. More than 20% of the carbon in
the universe may be associated with PAHs, complex compounds of carbon and
hydrogen without oxygen.[51] These compounds figure in the PAH_world_hypothesis
where they are hypothesized to have a role in abiogenesis and formation of
life. PAHs seem to have been formed "a couple of billion years" after the Big
Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new_stars
and exoplanets.[48]
It has been estimated that the solid earth as a whole contains 730 ppm of
carbon, with 2000 ppm in the core and 120 ppm in the combined mantle and crust.
[52] Since the mass of the earth is 5.972Ã1024 kg, this would imply 4360
million gigatonnes of carbon. This is much more than the amount of carbon in
the oceans or atmosphere (below).
In combination with oxygen in carbon_dioxide, carbon is found in the Earth's
atmosphere (approximately 810 gigatonnes of carbon) and dissolved in all water
bodies (approximately 36,000 gigatonnes of carbon). Around 1,900 gigatonnes of
carbon are present in the biosphere. Hydrocarbons (such as coal, petroleum, and
natural_gas) contain carbon as well. Coal "reserves"_(not_"resources") amount
to around 900 gigatonnes with perhaps 18,000 Gt of resources.[53] Oil_reserves
are around 150 gigatonnes. Proven sources of natural gas are about
175Ã1012 cubic metres (containing about 105 gigatonnes of carbon), but studies
estimate another 900Ã1012 cubic metres of "unconventional" deposits such as
shale_gas, representing about 540 gigatonnes of carbon.[54]
Carbon is also found in methane_hydrates in polar regions and under the seas.
Various estimates put this carbon between 500, 2500 Gt,[55] or 3,000 Gt.[56]
In the past, quantities of hydrocarbons were greater. According to one source,
in the period from 1751 to 2008 about 347 gigatonnes of carbon were released as
carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels.[57] Another
source puts the amount added to the atmosphere for the period since 1750 at 879
Gt, and the total going to the atmosphere, sea, and land (such as peat_bogs) at
almost 2,000 Gt.[58]
Carbon is a constituent (about 12% by mass) of the very large masses of
carbonate rock (limestone, dolomite, marble and so on). Coal is very rich in
carbon (anthracite contains 92â98%)[59] and is the largest commercial source
of mineral carbon, accounting for 4,000 gigatonnes or 80% of fossil_fuel.[60]
As for individual carbon allotropes, graphite is found in large quantities in
the United_States (mostly in New_York and Texas), Russia, Mexico, Greenland,
and India. Natural diamonds occur in the rock kimberlite, found in ancient
volcanic "necks", or "pipes". Most diamond deposits are in Africa, notably in
South_Africa, Namibia, Botswana, the Republic_of_the_Congo, and Sierra_Leone.
Diamond deposits have also been found in Arkansas, Canada, the Russian Arctic,
Brazil, and in Northern and Western Australia. Diamonds are now also being
recovered from the ocean floor off the Cape_of_Good_Hope. Diamonds are found
naturally, but about 30% of all industrial diamonds used in the U.S. are now
manufactured.
Carbon-14 is formed in upper layers of the troposphere and the stratosphere at
altitudes of 9â15 km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic_rays.[61]
Thermal_neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14,
forming carbon-14 and a proton. As such, 1.5%Ã10â10 of atmospheric carbon
dioxide contains carbon-14.[62]
Carbon-rich asteroids are relatively preponderant in the outer parts of the
asteroid_belt in our solar_system. These asteroids have not yet been directly
sampled by scientists. The asteroids can be used in hypothetical space-based
carbon_mining, which may be possible in the future, but is currently
technologically impossible.[63]
**** Isotopes ****
Main article: Isotopes_of_carbon
Isotopes of carbon are atomic_nuclei that contain six protons plus a number of
neutrons (varying from 2 to 16). Carbon has two stable, naturally occurring
isotopes.[14] The isotope carbon-12 (12C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth,
while carbon-13 (13C) forms the remaining 1.07%.[14] The concentration of 12C
is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions
discriminate against 13C.[64] In 1961, the International_Union_of_Pure_and
Applied_Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted the isotope carbon-12 as the basis for atomic
weights.[65] Identification of carbon in nuclear_magnetic_resonance (NMR)
experiments is done with the isotope 13C.
Carbon-14 (14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope, created in the upper
atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of
nitrogen with cosmic_rays.[66] It is found in trace amounts on Earth of 1 part
per trillion (0.0000000001%) or more, mostly confined to the atmosphere and
superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials.[67]
This isotope decays by 0.158 MeV Î²â_emission. Because of its relatively
short half-life of 5730 years, 14C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The
amount of 14C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but
decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in
radiocarbon_dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to
determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000 years.
[68][69]
There are 15 known isotopes of carbon and the shortest-lived of these is 8C
which decays through proton_emission and alpha_decay and has a half-life of
1.98739x10â21 s.[70] The exotic 19C exhibits a nuclear_halo, which means its
radius is appreciably larger than would be expected if the nucleus were a
sphere of constant density.[71]
**** Formation in stars ****
Main articles: Triple-alpha_process and CNO_cycle
Formation of the carbon atomic nucleus occurs within a giant or supergiant star
through the triple-alpha_process. This requires a nearly simultaneous collision
of three alpha_particles (helium nuclei), as the products of further nuclear
fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce
lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and
decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei.[72] The triple-alpha process
happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvins and helium
concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe
prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big
Bang.
According to current physical cosmology theory, carbon is formed in the
interiors of stars on the horizontal_branch.[73] When massive stars die as
supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes
component material for the formation of the next-generation_star systems with
accreted planets.[48][74] The Solar_System is one such star system with an
abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.
The CNO_cycle is an additional hydrogen fusion mechanism that powers stars,
wherein carbon operates as a catalyst.
Rotational transitions of various isotopic forms of carbon monoxide (for
example, 12CO, 13CO, and 18CO) are detectable in the submillimeter wavelength
range, and are used in the study of newly_forming_stars in molecular_clouds.
[75]
**** Carbon cycle ****
Main article: Carbon_cycle
Diagram of the carbon cycle. The black numbers indicate how much carbon is
stored in various reservoirs, in billions tonnes ("GtC" stands for gigatonnes
of carbon; figures are circa 2004). The purple numbers indicate how much carbon
moves between reservoirs each year. The sediments, as defined in this diagram,
do not include the â70 million GtC of carbonate rock and kerogen.
Under terrestrial conditions, conversion of one element to another is very
rare. Therefore, the amount of carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus,
processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it
somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon_cycle.
For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon_dioxide from the atmosphere (or
seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin_cycle, a process of
carbon_fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is
exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more
complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved
in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may
become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.[76][77]
***** Compounds *****
Main article: Compounds_of_carbon
**** Organic compounds ****
Structural formula of methane, the simplest possible organic compound.
Correlation between the carbon cycle and formation of organic compounds. In
plants, carbon dioxide formed by carbon fixation can join with water in
photosynthesis (green) to form organic compounds, which can be used and further
converted by both plants and animals.
Carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbonâcarbon_bonds, a
property that is called catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable.
Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of
unique compounds shows that more contain carbon than do not.[78] A similar
claim can be made for hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain
hydrogen.[citation_needed]
The simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbonâa large family of
organic_molecules that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of
carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other atoms, known
as heteroatoms. Common heteroatoms that appear in organic compounds include
oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and the nonradioactive halogens, as well
as the metals lithium and magnesium. Organic compounds containing bonds to
metal are known as organometallic compounds (see below). Certain groupings of
atoms, often including heteroatoms, recur in large numbers of organic
compounds. These collections, known as functional_groups, confer common
reactivity patterns and allow for the systematic study and categorization of
organic compounds. Chain length, shape and functional groups all affect the
properties of organic molecules.
In most stable compounds of carbon (and nearly all stable organic compounds),
carbon obeys the octet_rule and is tetravalent, meaning that a carbon atom
forms a total of four covalent bonds (which may include double and triple
bonds). Exceptions include a small number of stabilized carbocations (three
bonds, positive charge), radicals (three bonds, neutral), carbanions (three
bonds, negative charge) and carbenes (two bonds, neutral), although these
species are much more likely to be encountered as unstable, reactive
intermediates.
Carbon occurs in all known organic life and is the basis of organic_chemistry.
When united with hydrogen, it forms various hydrocarbons that are important to
industry as refrigerants, lubricants, solvents, as chemical feedstock for the
manufacture of plastics and petrochemicals, and as fossil_fuels.
When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of
important biological compounds including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols,
fats, and aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms
alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino
acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other
elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and
adenosine_triphosphate (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in
all living cells.
**** Inorganic compounds ****
Commonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or
which do not contain bonds to the other carbon atoms, halogens, or hydrogen,
are treated separately from classical organic_compounds; the definition is not
rigid, and the classification of some compounds can vary from author to author
(see reference articles above). Among these are the simple oxides of carbon.
The most prominent oxide is carbon_dioxide (CO
2). This was once the principal constituent of the paleoatmosphere, but is a
minor component of the Earth's_atmosphere today.[79] Dissolved in water, it
forms carbonic_acid (H
2CO
3), but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single
carbon it is unstable.[80] Through this intermediate, though, resonance-
stabilized carbonate ions are produced. Some important minerals are carbonates,
notably calcite. Carbon_disulfide (CS
2) is similar.[22] Nevertheless, due to its physical properties and its
association with organic synthesis, carbon disulfide is sometimes classified as
an organic solvent.[81]
The other common oxide is carbon_monoxide (CO). It is formed by incomplete
combustion, and is a colorless, odorless gas. The molecules each contain a
triple bond and are fairly polar, resulting in a tendency to bind permanently
to hemoglobin molecules, displacing oxygen, which has a lower binding affinity.
[82][83] Cyanide (CNâ), has a similar structure, but behaves much like a
halide ion (pseudohalogen). For example, it can form the nitride cyanogen
molecule ((CN)2), similar to diatomic halides. Likewise, the heavier analog of
cyanide, cyaphide (CPâ), is also considered inorganic, though most simple
derivatives are highly unstable. Other uncommon oxides are carbon_suboxide (C
3O
2),[84] the unstable dicarbon_monoxide (C2O),[85][86] carbon_trioxide (CO3),
[87][88] cyclopentanepentone (C5O5),[89] cyclohexanehexone (C6O6),[89] and
mellitic_anhydride (C12O9). However, mellitic anhydride is the triple acyl
anhydride of mellitic acid; moreover, it contains a benzene ring. Thus, many
chemists consider it to be organic.
With reactive metals, such as tungsten, carbon forms either carbides (C4â) or
acetylides (C2â
2) to form alloys with high melting points. These anions are also associated
with methane and acetylene, both very weak acids. With an electronegativity of
2.5,[90] carbon prefers to form covalent_bonds. A few carbides are covalent
lattices, like carborundum (SiC), which resembles diamond. Nevertheless, even
the most polar and salt-like of carbides are not completely ionic compounds.
[91]
**** Organometallic compounds ****
Main article: Organometallic_chemistry
Organometallic compounds by definition contain at least one carbon-metal
covalent bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include
simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), Î·2-alkene
compounds (for example, Zeise's_salt), and Î·3-allyl compounds (for example,
allylpalladium_chloride_dimer); metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl
ligands (for example, ferrocene); and transition_metal_carbene_complexes. Many
metal_carbonyls and metal_cyanides exist (for example, tetracarbonylnickel and
potassium_ferricyanide); some workers consider metal carbonyl and cyanide
complexes without other carbon ligands to be purely inorganic, and not
organometallic. However, most organometallic chemists consider metal complexes
with any carbon ligand, even 'inorganic carbon' (e.g., carbonyls, cyanides, and
certain types of carbides and acetylides) to be organometallic in nature. Metal
complexes containing organic ligands without a carbon-metal covalent bond
(e.g., metal carboxylates) are termed metalorganic compounds.
While carbon is understood to strongly prefer formation of four covalent bonds,
other exotic bonding schemes are also known. An interesting compound containing
an octahedral hexacoordinated carbon atom has been reported. The cation of the
compound is [(Ph3PAu)6C]2+. This phenomenon has been attributed to the
aurophilicity of the gold ligands, which provide additional stabilization of an
otherwise labile species.[92] In nature, the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco)
responsible for microbial nitrogen_fixation likewise has an octahedral carbon
center (formally a carbide, C(-IV)) bonded to six iron atoms. In 2016, it was
confirmed that, in line with earlier theoretical predictions, hexamethylbenzene
dication contains a carbon atom with six bonds, with the formulation [MeC(Î·5-
C5Me5)]2+, making it an "organic metallocene". Thus, a MeC3+ fragment is bonded
to a Î·5-C5Me5â fragment through all five of the carbons of the ring.[93]
It is important to note that in the cases above, each of the bonds to carbon
contain less than two formal electron pairs, making them hypercoordinate, but
not hypervalent. Even in cases of alleged 10-C-5 species (that is, a carbon
with five ligands and a formal electron count of ten), as reported by Akiba and
co-workers,[94] electronic structure calculations conclude that the total
number of electrons around carbon is still less than eight, as in the case of
other compounds described by three-center_bonding.
***** History and etymology *****
Antoine_Lavoisier in his youth
The English name carbon comes from the Latin carbo for coal and charcoal,[95]
whence also comes the French charbon, meaning charcoal. In German, Dutch and
Danish, the names for carbon are Kohlenstoff, koolstof and kulstof
respectively, all literally meaning coal-substance.
Carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of soot and
charcoal to the earliest human civilizations. Diamonds were known probably as
early as 2500 BCE in China, while carbon in the form of charcoal was made
around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in a
pyramid covered with clay to exclude air.[96][97]
Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele
In 1722, RenÃ©_Antoine_Ferchault_de_RÃ©aumur demonstrated that iron was
transformed into steel through the absorption of some substance, now known to
be carbon.[98] In 1772, Antoine_Lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of
carbon; when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither
produced any water and that both released the same amount of carbon_dioxide per
gram. In 1779,[99] Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele showed that graphite, which had been
thought of as a form of lead, was instead identical with charcoal but with a
small admixture of iron, and that it gave "aerial acid" (his name for carbon
dioxide) when oxidized with nitric acid.[100] In 1786, the French scientists
Claude_Louis_Berthollet, Gaspard_Monge and C. A. Vandermonde confirmed that
graphite was mostly carbon by oxidizing it in oxygen in much the same way
Lavoisier had done with diamond.[101] Some iron again was left, which the
French scientists thought was necessary to the graphite structure. In their
publication they proposed the name carbone (Latin carbonum) for the element in
graphite which was given off as a gas upon burning graphite. Antoine Lavoisier
then listed carbon as an element in his 1789 textbook.[102]
A new allotrope of carbon, fullerene, that was discovered in 1985[103] includes
nanostructured forms such as buckyballs and nanotubes.[29] Their
discoverers â Robert_Curl, Harold_Kroto and Richard_Smalley â received the
Nobel_Prize in Chemistry in 1996.[104] The resulting renewed interest in new
forms lead to the discovery of further exotic allotropes, including glassy
carbon, and the realization that "amorphous_carbon" is not strictly amorphous.
[36]
***** Production *****
**** Graphite ****
Main article: Graphite
Commercially viable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the
world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil
and North_Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in
association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and
metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre
or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England
were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century,
pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips
before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are
obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on
water.[105]
There are three types of natural graphiteâamorphous, flake or crystalline
flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most
abundant. Contrary to science, in industry "amorphous" refers to very small
crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used
for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large
amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United
States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it
occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite
can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed
into expandable graphite for many uses, such as flame_retardants. The foremost
deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar.
Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of
natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps,
and it is only commercially mined in Sri Lanka.[105]
According to the USGS, world production of natural graphite was 1.1 million
tonnes in 2010, to which China contributed 800,000 t, India 130,000 t, Brazil
76,000 t, North Korea 30,000 t and Canada 25,000 t. No natural graphite was
reported mined in the United States, but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with
an estimated value of $998 million was produced in 2009.[105]
**** Diamond ****
Main article: Diamond
Diamond output in 2005
The diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful
businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations
around the world (see figure).
Only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The
ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger
diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles
are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density
fraction with the help of X-ray_fluorescence, after which the final sorting
steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the
separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to
stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.[106]
Historically diamonds were known to be found only in alluvial deposits in
southern_India.[107] India led the world in diamond production from the time of
their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC[108] to the mid-18th
century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by
the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the
first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.[109]
Diamond production of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only
started in the 1870s after the discovery of the diamond fields in South Africa.
Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5 billion
carats have been mined since that date.[110] About 20% of that amount has been
mined in the last 5 years alone, and during the last ten years 9 new mines have
started production while 4 more are waiting to be opened soon. Most of these
mines are located in Canada, Zimbabwe, Angola, and one in Russia.[110]
In the United States, diamonds have been found in Arkansas, Colorado and
Montana.[111][112] In 2004, a startling discovery of a microscopic diamond in
the United States[113] led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite
pipes in a remote part of Montana.[114]
Today, most commercially viable diamond deposits are in Russia, Botswana,
Australia and the Democratic_Republic_of_Congo.[115] In 2005, Russia produced
almost one-fifth of the global diamond output, reports the British_Geological
Survey. Australia has the richest diamantiferous pipe with production reaching
peak levels of 42 metric tons (41 long tons; 46 short tons) per year in the
1990s.[111] There are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the
Northwest_Territories of Canada, Siberia (mostly in Yakutia_territory; for
example, Mir_pipe and Udachnaya_pipe), Brazil, and in Northern and Western
Australia.

Carbon is essential to all known living systems, and without it life as we know
it could not exist (see alternative_biochemistry). The major economic use of
carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably
the fossil_fuel methane gas and crude_oil (petroleum). Crude_oil is distilled
in refineries by the petrochemical_industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and
other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by
plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used
primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon
polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made
from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included
at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of
these synthetic substances come from crude oil.
The uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form alloys
with iron, of which the most common is carbon_steel. Graphite is combined with
clays to form the 'lead' used in pencils used for writing and drawing. It is
also used as a lubricant and a pigment, as a molding material in glass
manufacture, in electrodes for dry batteries and in electroplating and
electroforming, in brushes for electric_motors and as a neutron_moderator in
nuclear_reactors.
Charcoal is used as a drawing material in artwork, barbecue grilling, iron
smelting, and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as fuel
for production of energy and heating. Gem quality diamond is used in jewelry,
and industrial_diamonds are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for
machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and
carbon_fiber, made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to
reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight composite_materials.
Carbon_fiber is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic
structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting
material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have
structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may
re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers
with higher specific_tensile_strength than steel.[116]
Carbon_black is used as the black pigment in printing ink, artist's oil paint
and water colours, carbon_paper, automotive finishes, India_ink and laser
printer toner. Carbon_black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as
tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated_charcoal is used as an absorbent and
adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas_masks, water
purification, and kitchen extractor_hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins,
poisons, or gases from the digestive_system. Carbon is used in chemical
reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron
(smelting). Case_hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel
components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium,
are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and
grinding tools. Carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in
clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of
the interior surfaces in the built_environment other than glass, stone and
metal.
**** Diamonds ****
The diamond industry falls into two categories: one dealing with gem-grade
diamonds and the other, with industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in
both types of diamonds exists, the two markets act in dramatically different
ways.
Unlike precious_metals such as gold or platinum, gem diamonds do not trade as a
commodity: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is
not a very active market for resale of diamonds.
Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity,
with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant.
About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20 tonnes
annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones are relegated for industrial use
(known as bort).[117] synthetic_diamonds, invented in the 1950s, found almost
immediate industrial applications; 3 billion carats (600 tonnes) of synthetic
diamond is produced annually.[118]
The dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and
polishing. Most of these applications do not require large diamonds; in fact,
most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used
industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into
a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications.[119] Specialized
applications include use in laboratories as containment for high_pressure
experiments (see diamond_anvil_cell), high-performance bearings, and limited
use in specialized windows.[120][121] With the continuing advances in the
production of synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible.
Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor
suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance
property, as a heat_sink in electronics.[122]
***** Precautions *****
Worker at carbon_black plant in Sunray,_Texas (photo by John_Vachon, 1942)
Pure carbon has extremely low toxicity to humans and can be handled and even
ingested safely in the form of graphite or charcoal.[citation_needed] It is
resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the
digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is
likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon_black was probably one of the first
pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ãtzi_the_Iceman was found to have
carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200 years after his
death.[123] Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities
can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung
disease, coalworker's_pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be
harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel
engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs.[124] In these examples,
the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals)
rather than from the carbon itself.
Carbon generally has low toxicity to life_on_Earth; but carbon nanoparticles
are deadly to Drosophila.[125]
Carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the presence of air at high
temperatures. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert for
hundreds of millions of years in the absence of oxygen, may spontaneously
combust when exposed to air in coal mine waste tips, ship cargo holds and coal
bunkers,[126][127] and storage dumps.
In nuclear_applications where graphite is used as a neutron_moderator,
accumulation of Wigner_energy followed by a sudden, spontaneous release may
occur. Annealing to at least 250 Â°C can release the energy safely, although in
the Windscale_fire the procedure went wrong, causing other reactor materials to
combust.
The great variety of carbon compounds include such lethal poisons as
tetrodotoxin, the lectin ricin from seeds of the castor_oil_plant Ricinus
communis, cyanide (CNâ), and carbon_monoxide; and such essentials to life as
glucose and protein.
