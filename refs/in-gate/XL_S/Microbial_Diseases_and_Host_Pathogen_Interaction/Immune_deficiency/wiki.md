Immune deficiency
Other names Immune deficiency
Specialty   Immunology
Immunodeficiency is a state in which the immune_system's ability to fight
infectious_disease and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases of
immunodeficiency are acquired ("secondary") due to extrinsic factors that
affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include
HIV infection, extremes of age, and environmental_factors, such as nutrition.
[1] In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as
steroids, can be either an adverse_effect or the intended purpose of the
treatment. Examples of such use is in organ_transplant surgery as an anti-
rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system,
as in autoimmune_diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their
immune_system, or primary_immunodeficiency. A person who has an
immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An
immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic
infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone.
Immunodeficiency also decreases cancer_immunosurveillance, in which the immune
system scans the body's cells and kills neoplastic ones.

***** Types[edit] *****
**** By affected component[edit] ****
    * Humoral_immune_deficiency (including B cell deficiency or dysfunction),
      with signs or symptoms depending on the cause, but generally include
      signs of hypogammaglobulinemia (decrease of one or more types of
      antibodies) with presentations including repeated mild respiratory
      infections, and/or agammaglobulinemia (lack of all or most antibody
      production) which results in frequent severe infections and is often
      fatal.[2]
    * T_cell_deficiency, often causes secondary disorders such as acquired
      immune_deficiency_syndrome (AIDS).[3]
    * Granulocyte deficiency, including decreased numbers of granulocytes
      (called as granulocytopenia or, if absent, agranulocytosis) such as of
      neutrophil_granulocytes (termed neutropenia). Granulocyte deficiencies
      also include decreased function of individual granulocytes, such as in
      chronic_granulomatous_disease.
    * Asplenia, where there is no function of the spleen
    * Complement_deficiency is where the function of the complement_system is
      deficient
In reality, immunodeficiency often affects multiple components, with notable
examples including severe_combined_immunodeficiency (which is primary) and
acquired_immune_deficiency_syndrome (which is secondary).

**** Primary or secondary[edit] ****
Distinction between primary versus secondary immunodeficiencies are based on,
respectively, whether the cause originates in the immune system itself or is,
in turn, due to insufficiency of a supporting component of it or an external
decreasing factor of it.
*** Primary immunodeficiency[edit] ***
Main article: Primary_immunodeficiency
A number of rare_diseases feature a heightened susceptibility to infections
from childhood onward. Primary Immunodeficiency is also known as congenital
immunodeficiencies.[7] Many of these disorders are hereditary and are autosomal
recessive or X-linked. There are over 95 recognised primary immunodeficiency
syndromes; they are generally grouped by the part of the immune system that is
malfunctioning, such as lymphocytes or granulocytes.[8]
The treatment of primary immunodeficiencies depends on the nature of the
defect, and may involve antibody infusions, long-term antibiotics and (in some
cases) stem_cell_transplantation.The characteristics of lacking and/or impaired
antibody functions can be related to illnesses such as X-Linked
Agammaglobulinemia and Common Variable Immune Deficiency [9]
*** Secondary immunodeficiencies[edit] ***
Further information: Immunosuppression
Secondary immunodeficiencies, also known as acquired immunodeficiencies, can
result from various immunosuppressive agents, for example, malnutrition, aging,
particular medications (e.g., chemotherapy, disease-modifying_antirheumatic
drugs, immunosuppressive_drugs after organ_transplants, glucocorticoids) and
environmental_toxins like mercury and other heavy_metals, pesticides and
petrochemicals like styrene, dichlorobenzene, xylene, and ethylphenol. For
medications, the term immunosuppression generally refers to both beneficial and
potential adverse effects of decreasing the function of the immune system,
while the term immunodeficiency generally refers solely to the adverse effect
of increased risk for infection.
Many specific diseases directly or indirectly cause immunosuppression. This
includes many types of cancer, particularly those of the bone marrow and blood
cells (leukemia, lymphoma, multiple_myeloma), and certain chronic infections.
Immunodeficiency is also the hallmark of acquired_immunodeficiency_syndrome
(AIDS),[7] caused by the human_immunodeficiency_virus (HIV). HIV directly
infects a small number of T_helper_cells, and also impairs other immune system
responses indirectly.
Various hormonal and metabolic disorders can also result in immune deficiency
including anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes and hypoglycemia.
Smoking, alcoholism and drug abuse also depress immune response.

There are a large number of immunodeficiency syndromes that present clinical
and laboratory characteristics of autoimmunity. The decreased ability of the
immune system to clear infections in these patients may be responsible for
causing autoimmunity through perpetual immune system activation.[10]
 This section may be too technical for most readers to understand. Please help
 improve_it to make_it_understandable_to_non-experts, without removing the
 technical details. (November 2016)(Learn_how_and_when_to_remove_this_template
 message)
One example is common_variable_immunodeficiency (CVID) where multiple
autoimmune diseases are seen, e.g., inflammatory_bowel_disease, autoimmune
thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune thyroid disease. Familial_hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis, an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency, is
another example. Low_blood_levels_of_red_blood_cells,_white_blood_cells,_and
platelets, rashes, lymph_node_enlargement, and enlargement_of_the_liver_and
spleen are commonly seen in these patients. Presence of multiple uncleared
viral infections due to lack of perforin are thought to be responsible. In
addition to chronic and/or recurrent infections many autoimmune diseases
including arthritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, scleroderma and type 1
diabetes are also seen in X-linked_agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Recurrent
bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammation of the gut and lungs
are seen in chronic_granulomatous_disease (CGD) as well. CGD is caused by a
decreased production of nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate (NADPH)
oxidase by neutrophils. Hypomorphic RAG mutations are seen in patients with
midline_granulomatous_disease; an autoimmune disorder that is commonly seen in
patients with granulomatosis_with_polyangiitis and NK/T cell lymphomas.
Wiskott-Aldrich_syndrome (WAS) patients also present with eczema, autoimmune
manifestations, recurrent bacterial infections and lymphoma. In autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal_dystrophy (APECED) also autoimmunity
and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g.,
hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical failure) and chronic mucocutaneous
candidiasis. Finally, IgA deficiency is also sometimes associated with the
development of autoimmune and atopic phenomena.
***** Causes[edit] *****
The cause of immunodeficiency varies depending on the nature of the disorder.
The cause can be either genetic or acquired by malnutrition and poor sanitary
conditions. Only for some genetic causes, the exact genes are known.[11]
Although there is no true discrimination to who this disease affects, the genes
are passed from mother to child, and on occasion from father to child. Women
tend not to show symptoms due to their second X chromosome not having the
mutation while men are symptomatic, due to having one X chromosome.[9]
***** Treatment[edit] *****
Available treatment falls into two modalities: treating infections and boosting
the immune system.
Prevention of Pneumocystis_pneumonia using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is
useful in those who are immunocompromised.[12] In the early 1950s
Immunoglobulin(Ig) was used by doctors to treat patients with primary
immunodeficiency through intramuscular injection. Ig replacement therapy are
infusions that can be either subcutaneous or intravenously administrated,
resulting in higher Ig levels for about three to four weeks, although this
varies with each patient.[9]
***** Prognosis[edit] *****
Prognosis depends greatly on the nature and severity of the condition. Some
deficiencies cause early mortality (before age one), others with or even
without treatment are lifelong conditions that cause little mortality or
morbidity. Newer stem cell transplant technologies may lead to gene based
treatments of debilitating and fatal genetic immune deficiencies. Prognosis of
acquired immune deficiencies depends on avoiding or treating the causative
agent or condition (like AIDS).
