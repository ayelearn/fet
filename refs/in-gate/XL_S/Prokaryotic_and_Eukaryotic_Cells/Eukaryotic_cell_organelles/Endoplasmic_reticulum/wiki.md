The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a type of organelle found in eukaryotic_cells
that forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or
tube-like structures known as cisternae. The membranes of the ER are continuous
with the outer nuclear_membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types
of eukaryotic cells, but is absent from red_blood_cells and spermatozoa.
There are two types of ER: rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic
reticulum. The outer (cytosolic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is
studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein_synthesis. The rough
endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes. The
smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid synthesis
but not metabolism, the production of steroid_hormones, and detoxification.[1]
The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells.

***** History[edit] *****
The ER was observed with light_microscope by Garnier in 1897, who coined the
term "ergastoplasm".[2][3] With electron_microscopy, the lacy membranes of the
endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 by Keith_R._Porter, Albert
Claude, and Ernest F. Fullam.[4] Later, the word "reticulum", which means
"network", was applied by Porter in 1953 to describe this fabric of membranes.

3D rendering of endoplasmic reticulum
The general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes
called cisternae. These sac-like structures are held together by the
cytoskeleton. The phospholipid_membrane encloses the cisternal space (or
lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear_space but separate from the
cytosol. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the
synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and
cell type and cell function. The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic
reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other,
depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell. Transformation can
include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes.
Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.[6]

**** Rough endoplasmic reticulum[edit] ****

synthesized into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (which appears at upper right
in animation when approximately half of animation is done). The total animation
time is about 2 minutes.
The surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated RER or Rough
ER) (also called granular endoplasmic reticulum) is studded with protein-
manufacturing ribosomes giving it a "rough" appearance (hence its name).[8] The
binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the
translocon.[9] However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's
structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A
ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex
forms in the cytosol. This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins
translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory_pathway.[10] The
first 5â30 amino_acids polymerized encode a signal_peptide, a molecular
message that is recognized and bound by a signal_recognition_particle (SRP).
Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where
translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen
and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a
signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point
may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are
also known to stay associated with translocons.[11]
The membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum forms large double membrane
sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the
nuclear_envelope.[12] The double membrane sheets are stacked and connected
through several right or left-handed helical ramps, the so-called Terasaki
ramps, giving rise to a structure resembling a multi-storey_car_park.[13][14]
Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and
the Golgi_apparatus, membrane-bound transport_vesicles shuttle proteins between
these two compartments.[15] Vesicles are surrounded by coating_proteins called
COPI and COPII. COPII targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and COPI marks
them to be brought back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough
endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the Golgi_complex to target_new
proteins to their proper destinations. A second method of transport out of the
endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called membrane_contact_sites, where the
membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely
together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.[16][17]
The rough endoplasmic reticulum is key in multiple functions:
    * Manufacture of lysosomal enzymes with a mannose-6-phosphate marker added
      in the cis-Golgi network.[citation_needed]
    * Manufacture of secreted proteins, either secreted constitutively with no
      tag or secreted in a regulatory manner involving clathrin and paired
      basic amino acids in the signal_peptide.
    * Integral_membrane_proteins that stay embedded in the membrane as vesicles
      exit and bind to new membranes. Rab proteins are key in targeting the
      membrane; SNAP and SNARE proteins are key in the fusion event.
    * Initial glycosylation as assembly continues. This is N-linked (O-linking
      occurs in the Golgi).
          o N-linked glycosylation: If the protein is properly folded,
            Oligosaccharyltransferase recognizes the AA sequence NXS or NXT
            (with the S/T residue phosphorylated) and adds a 14-sugar backbone
            (2-N-acetylglucosamine, 9-branching mannose, and 3-glucose at the
            end) to the side-chain nitrogen of Asn.
**** Smooth endoplasmic reticulum[edit] ****

magnification.
In most cells the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (abbreviated SER) is scarce.
Instead there are areas where the ER is partly smooth and partly rough, this
area is called the transitional ER. The transitional ER gets its name because
it contains ER exit sites. These are areas where the transport vesicles that
contain lipids and proteins made in the ER, detach from the ER and start moving
to the Golgi_apparatus. Specialized cells can have a lot of smooth endoplasmic
reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions.[6] It
synthesizes lipids, phospholipids,[18][19][20] and steroids. Cells which
secrete these products, such as those in the testes, ovaries, and sebaceous
glands have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.[21] It also carries
out the metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of natural metabolism
products and of alcohol and drugs, attachment of receptors on cell membrane
proteins, and steroid_metabolism.[22] In muscle cells, it regulates calcium ion
concentration. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types
(both animal and plant), and it serves different functions in each. The smooth
endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which
converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, a step in gluconeogenesis. It is
connected to the nuclear_envelope and consists of tubules that are located near
the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is
reticular in appearance.[12] In some cells, there are dilated areas like the
sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic
reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or
storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.
*** Sarcoplasmic reticulum[edit] ***
Main article: Sarcoplasmic_reticulum
See also: Calcium-induced_calcium_release
Skeletal_muscle fiber, with sarcoplasmic reticulum colored in blue.
The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), from the Greek ÏÎ¬ÏÎ¾ sarx ("flesh"), is
smooth ER found in myocytes. The only structural difference between this
organelle and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the medley of proteins they
have, both bound to their membranes and drifting within the confines of their
lumens. This fundamental difference is indicative of their functions: The
endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes molecules, while the sarcoplasmic reticulum
stores calcium ions and pumps them out into the sarcoplasm when the muscle
fiber is stimulated.[23][24] After their release from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum, calcium ions interact with contractile proteins that utilize ATP to
shorten the muscle fiber. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in
excitation-contraction_coupling.[25]
***** Functions[edit] *****
The endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding
of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and the transport of synthesized
proteins in vesicles to the Golgi_apparatus. Correct folding of newly made
proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins,
including protein_disulfide_isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member
BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family.
Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi
apparatus â unfolded proteins cause an unfolded_protein_response as a stress
response in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation,
glucose deprivation, and viral infection[26] or the over-expression of proteins
[27] can lead to endoplasmic_reticulum_stress_response (ER stress), a state in
which the folding of proteins slows, leading to an increase in unfolded
proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/
ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.[28]
**** Protein transport[edit] ****
Secretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, are moved across the endoplasmic
reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum
throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal_sequence.
The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a
few amino_acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the
polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the
translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are
destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport
vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human
fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the
depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria,
which are also associated with the ER.[29]
The endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in
essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its
resident proteins are retained within it through a retention motif. This motif
is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most
common retention sequences are KDEL for lumen located proteins and KKXX for
transmembrane protein.[30] However, variations of KDEL and KKXX do occur, and
other sequences can also give rise to endoplasmic reticulum retention. It is
not known whether such variation can lead to sub-ER localizations. There are
three KDEL (1, 2 and 3) receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high
degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors
remain to be established.[31]
**** Bioenergetics regulation by a CaATiER mechanism[edit] ****
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) does not harbor an ATP-regeneration machinery,
and therefore requires ATP import from mitochondria to exert its biological
function. For example, the imported ATP is used for protein folding and
trafficking [32]
***** Clinical significance[edit] *****
Abnormalities in XBP1 lead to a heightened endoplasmic_reticulum_stress
response and subsequently causes a higher susceptibility for inflammatory
processes that may even contribute to Alzheimer's_disease.[33] In the colon,
XBP1 anomalies have been linked to the inflammatory bowel diseases including
Crohn's_disease.[34]
The unfolded_protein_response (UPR) is a cellular_stress_response related to
the endoplasmic reticulum.[35] The UPR is activated in response to an
accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum. The UPR functions to restore normal function of the cell by halting
protein translation, degrading misfolded proteins, and activating the signaling
pathways that lead to increasing the production of molecular chaperones
involved in protein_folding. Sustained overactivation of the UPR has been
implicated in prion diseases as well as several other neurodegenerative
diseases and the inhibition of the UPR could become a treatment for those
diseases.[36]
