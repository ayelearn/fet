Biological membrane that separates the interior of a cell from its outside
environment

Comparison of Eukaryotes vs. Prokaryotes
The cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane (PM) or cytoplasmic
membrane, and historically referred to as the plasmalemma) is a biological
membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside_environment
(the extracellular space) which protects the cell from its environment.[1][2]
Cell membrane is consisted of a lipid_bilayer, including cholesterols (a lipid
component) that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity under
various temperature, in combination with proteins such as integral_proteins,
and peripheral_proteins that go across inside and outside of the membrane
serving as membrane_transporter, and loosely attached to the outer (peripheral)
side of the cell membrane acting as several kinds of enzymes shaping the cell ,
respectively.[3] The cell membrane controls_the_movement_of_substances in and
out of cells and organelles. In this way, it is selectively_permeable to ions
and organic_molecules.[4] In addition, cell membranes are involved in a variety
of cellular processes such as cell_adhesion, ion_conductivity and cell
signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular
structures, including the cell_wall, the carbohydrate layer called the
glycocalyx, and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the
cytoskeleton. In the field of synthetic biology, cell membranes can be
artificially_reassembled.[5][6][7]

***** History *****
Main article: History_of_cell_membrane_theory
While Robert_Hookeâs discovery of cells in 1665 led to the proposal of the
Cell_Theory, Hooke misled the cell_membrane_theory that all cells contained a
hard cell wall since only plant cells could be observed at the time.[8]
Microscopists focused on the cell wall for well over 150 years until advances
in microscopy were made. In the early 19th century, cells were recognized as
being separate entities, unconnected, and bound by individual cell walls after
it was found that plant cells could be separated. This theory extended to
include animal cells to suggest a universal mechanism for cell protection and
development. By the second half of the 19th century, microscopy was still not
advanced enough to make a distinction between cell membranes and cell walls.
However, some microscopists correctly identified at this time that while
invisible, it could be inferred that cell membranes existed in animal cells due
to intracellular movement of components internally but not externally and that
membranes werenât the equivalent of a cell wall to plant cell. It was also
inferred that cell membranes werenât vital components to all cells. Many
refuted the existence of a cell membrane still towards the end of the 19th
century. In 1890, an update to the Cell Theory stated that cell membranes
existed, but were merely secondary structures. It wasnât until later studies
with osmosis and permeability that cell membranes gained more recognition.[8]
In 1895, Ernest_Overton proposed that cell membranes were made of lipids.[9]
The lipid bilayer hypothesis, proposed in 1925 by Gorter and Grendel,[10]
created speculation to the description of the cell membrane bilayer structure
based on crystallographic studies and soap bubble observations. In an attempt
to accept or reject the hypothesis, researchers measured membrane thickness.[8]
In 1925 it was determined by Fricke that the thickness of erythrocyte and yeast
cell membranes ranged between 3.3 and 4 nm, a thickness compatible with a lipid
monolayer. The choice of the dielectric constant used in these studies was
called into question but future tests could not disprove the results of the
initial experiment. Independently, the leptoscope was invented in order to
measure very thin membranes by comparing the intensity of light reflected from
a sample to the intensity of a membrane standard of known thickness. The
instrument could resolve thicknesses that depended on pH measurements and the
presence of membrane proteins that ranged from 8.6 to 23.2 nm, with the lower
measurements supporting the lipid bilayer hypothesis. Later in the 1930s, the
membrane structure model developed in general agreement to be the
paucimolecular_model of Davson and Danielli (1935). This model was based on
studies of surface tension between oils and echinoderm eggs. Since the surface
tension values appeared to be much lower than would be expected for an
oilâwater interface, it was assumed that some substance was responsible for
lowering the interfacial tensions in the surface of cells. It was suggested
that a lipid bilayer was in between two thin protein layers. The paucimolecular
model immediately became popular and it dominated cell membrane studies for the
following 30 years, until it became rivaled by the fluid mosaic model of Singer
and Nicolson (1972).[11][8]
Despite the numerous models of the cell membrane proposed prior to the fluid
mosaic_model, it remains the primary archetype for the cell membrane long after
its inception in the 1970s.[8] Although the fluid_mosaic_model has been
modernized to detail contemporary discoveries, the basics have remained
constant: the membrane is a lipid bilayer composed of hydrophilic exterior
heads and a hydrophobic interior where proteins can interact with hydrophilic
heads through polar interactions, but proteins that span the bilayer fully or
partially have hydrophobic amino acids that interact with the non-polar lipid
interior. The fluid_mosaic_model not only provided an accurate representation
of membrane mechanics, it enhanced the study of hydrophobic forces, which would
later develop into an essential descriptive limitation to describe biological
macromolecules.[8]
For many centuries, the scientists cited disagreed with the significance of the
structure they were seeing as the cell membrane. For almost two centuries, the
membranes were seen but mostly disregarded this as an important structure with
cellular function. It was not until the 20th century that the significance of
the cell membrane as it was acknowledged. Finally, two scientists Gorter and
Grendel (1925) made the discovery that the membrane is âlipid-basedâ. From
this, they furthered the idea that this structure would have to be in a
formation that mimicked layers. Once studied further, it was found by comparing
the sum of the cell surfaces and the surfaces of the lipids, a 2:1 ratio was
estimated; thus, providing the first basis of the bilayer structure known
today. This discovery initiated many new studies that arose globally within
various fields of scientific studies, confirming that the structure and
functions of the cell membrane are widely accepted.[8]
The structure has been variously referred to by different writers as the
ectoplast (de_Vries, 1885),[12] Plasmahaut (plasma skin, Pfeffer, 1877, 1891),
[13] Hautschicht (skin layer, Pfeffer, 1886; used with a different meaning by
Hofmeister, 1867), plasmatic membrane (Pfeffer, 1900),[14] plasma membrane,
cytoplasmic membrane, cell envelope and cell membrane.[15][16] Some authors who
did not believe that there was a functional permeable boundary at the surface
of the cell preferred to use the term plasmalemma (coined by Mast, 1924) for
the external region of the cell.[17][18][19]
***** Composition *****
Cell membranes contain a variety of biological molecules, notably lipids and
proteins. Composition is not set, but constantly changing for fluidity and
changes in the environment, even fluctuating during different stages of cell
development. Specifically, the amount of cholesterol in human primary neuron
cell membrane changes, and this change in composition affects fluidity
throughout development stages.[20]
Material is incorporated into the membrane, or deleted from it, by a variety of
mechanisms:
    * Fusion of intracellular vesicles with the membrane (exocytosis) not only
      excretes the contents of the vesicle but also incorporates the vesicle
      membrane's components into the cell membrane. The membrane may form blebs
      around extracellular material that pinch off to become vesicles
      (endocytosis).
    * If a membrane is continuous with a tubular structure made of membrane
      material, then material from the tube can be drawn into the membrane
      continuously.
    * Although the concentration of membrane components in the aqueous phase is
      low (stable membrane components have low solubility in water), there is
      an exchange of molecules between the lipid and aqueous phases.
**** Lipids ****
Examples of the major membrane phospholipids and glycolipids:
phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn),
phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylserine (PtdSer).
The cell membrane consists of three classes of amphipathic lipids:
phospholipids, glycolipids, and sterols. The amount of each depends upon the
type of cell, but in the majority of cases phospholipids are the most abundant,
often contributing for over 50% of all lipids in plasma membranes.[21][22]
Glycolipids only account for a minute amount of about 2% and sterols make up
the rest. In RBC studies, 30% of the plasma membrane is lipid. However, for the
majority of eukaryotic cells, the composition of plasma membranes is about half
lipids and half proteins by weight.
The fatty chains in phospholipids and glycolipids usually contain an even
number of carbon atoms, typically between 16 and 20. The 16- and 18-carbon
fatty acids are the most common. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated,
with the configuration of the double bonds nearly always "cis". The length and
the degree of unsaturation of fatty acid chains have a profound effect on
membrane fluidity as unsaturated lipids create a kink, preventing the fatty
acids from packing together as tightly, thus decreasing the melting_temperature
(increasing the fluidity) of the membrane.[21][22] The ability of some
organisms to regulate the_fluidity_of_their_cell_membranes by altering lipid
composition is called homeoviscous_adaptation.
The entire membrane is held together via non-covalent interaction of
hydrophobic tails, however the structure is quite fluid and not fixed rigidly
in place. Under physiological_conditions phospholipid molecules in the cell
membrane are in the liquid_crystalline_state. It means the lipid molecules are
free to diffuse and exhibit rapid lateral diffusion along the layer in which
they are present.[21] However, the exchange of phospholipid molecules between
intracellular and extracellular leaflets of the bilayer is a very slow process.
Lipid_rafts and caveolae are examples of cholesterol-enriched microdomains in
the cell membrane.[22] Also, a fraction of the lipid in direct contact with
integral membrane proteins, which is tightly bound to the protein surface is
called annular_lipid_shell; it behaves as a part of protein complex.
In animal cells cholesterol is normally found dispersed in varying degrees
throughout cell membranes, in the irregular spaces between the hydrophobic
tails of the membrane lipids, where it confers a stiffening and strengthening
effect on the membrane.[4] Additionally, the amount of cholesterol in
biological membranes varies between organisms, cell types, and even in
individual cells. Cholesterol, a major component of animal plasma membranes,
regulates the fluidity of the overall membrane, meaning that cholesterol
controls the amount of movement of the various cell membrane components based
on its concentrations.[4] In high temperatures, cholesterol inhibits the
movement of phospholipid fatty acid chains, causing a reduced permeability to
small molecules and reduced membrane fluidity. The opposite is true for the
role of cholesterol in cooler temperatures. Cholesterol production, and thus
concentration, is up-regulated (increased) in response to cold temperature. At
cold temperatures, cholesterol interferes with fatty acid chain interactions.
Acting as antifreeze, cholesterol maintains the fluidity of the membrane.
Cholesterol is more abundant in cold-weather animals than warm-weather animals.
In plants, which lack cholesterol, related compounds called sterols perform the
same function as cholesterol.[4]
**** Phospholipids forming lipid vesicles ****
Lipid vesicles or liposomes are approximately spherical pockets that are
enclosed by a lipid bilayer.[23] These structures are used in laboratories to
study the effects of chemicals in cells by delivering these chemicals directly
to the cell, as well as getting more insight into cell membrane permeability.
Lipid vesicles and liposomes are formed by first suspending a lipid in an
aqueous solution then agitating the mixture through sonication, resulting in a
vesicle. By measuring the rate of efflux from that of the inside of the vesicle
to the ambient solution, allows researcher to better understand membrane
permeability. Vesicles can be formed with molecules and ions inside the vesicle
by forming the vesicle with the desired molecule or ion present in the
solution. Proteins can also be embedded into the membrane through solubilizing
the desired proteins in the presence of detergents and attaching them to the
phospholipids in which the liposome is formed. These provide researchers with a
tool to examine various membrane protein functions.
**** Carbohydrates ****
Plasma membranes also contain carbohydrates, predominantly glycoproteins, but
with some glycolipids (cerebrosides and gangliosides). Carbohydrates are
important in the role of cell-cell_recognition in eukaryotes; they are located
on the surface of the cell where they recognize host cells and share
information, viruses that bind to cells using these receptors cause an
infection [24] For the most part, no glycosylation occurs on membranes within
the cell; rather generally glycosylation occurs on the extracellular surface of
the plasma membrane. The glycocalyx is an important feature in all cells,
especially epithelia with microvilli. Recent data suggest the glycocalyx
participates in cell adhesion, lymphocyte_homing,[24] and many others. The
penultimate sugar is galactose and the terminal sugar is sialic_acid, as the
sugar backbone is modified in the Golgi_apparatus. Sialic acid carries a
negative charge, providing an external barrier to charged particles.
**** Proteins ****

                                                                                           Ion

              dissociates to carry on its work in the cytoplasm.                           hormones
The cell membrane has large content of proteins, typically around 50% of
membrane volume[25] These proteins are important for cell because they are
responsible for various biological activities. Approximately a third of the
genes in yeast code specifically for them, and this number is even higher in
multicellular organisms.[23] Membrane proteins consist of three main types:
Integral proteins, peripheral proteins, and lipid-anchored proteins.[4]
As shown in the adjacent table, integral proteins are amphipathic transmembrane
proteins. Examples of integral proteins include ion channels, proton pumps, and
g-protein coupled receptors. Ion channels allow inorganic ions such as sodium,
potassium, calcium, or chlorine to diffuse down their electrochemical gradient
across the lipid bilayer through hydrophilic pores across the membrane. The
electrical behavior of cells (i.e. nerve cells) are controlled by ion channels.
[4] Proton pumps are protein pumps that are embedded in the lipid bilayer that
allow protons to travel through the membrane by transferring from one amino
acid side chain to another. Processes such as electron transport and generating
ATP use proton pumps.[4] A G-protein coupled receptor is a single polypeptide
chain that crosses the lipid bilayer seven times responding to signal molecules
(i.e. hormones and neurotransmitters). G-protein coupled receptors are used in
processes such as cell to cell signaling, the regulation of the production of
cAMP, and the regulation of ion channels.[4]
The cell membrane, being exposed to the outside environment, is an important
site of cellâcell communication. As such, a large variety of protein
receptors and identification proteins, such as antigens, are present on the
surface of the membrane. Functions of membrane proteins can also include
cellâcell contact, surface recognition, cytoskeleton contact, signaling,
enzymatic activity, or transporting substances across the membrane.
Most membrane proteins must be inserted in some way into the membrane.[26] For
this to occur, an N-terminus "signal sequence" of amino acids directs proteins
to the endoplasmic_reticulum, which inserts the proteins into a lipid bilayer.
Once inserted, the proteins are then transported to their final destination in
vesicles, where the vesicle fuses with the target membrane.
***** Function *****
A detailed diagram of the cell membrane
Illustration depicting cellular diffusion
The cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of living cells, physically
separating the intracellular components from the extracellular environment. The
cell membrane also plays a role in anchoring the cytoskeleton to provide shape
to the cell, and in attaching to the extracellular_matrix and other cells to
hold them together to form tissues. Fungi, bacteria, most archaea, and plants
also have a cell_wall, which provides a mechanical support to the cell and
precludes the passage of larger_molecules.
The cell membrane is selectively_permeable and able to regulate what enters and
exits the cell, thus facilitating the transport of materials needed for
survival. The movement of substances across the membrane can be either
"passive", occurring without the input of cellular energy, or "active",
requiring the cell to expend energy in transporting it. The membrane also
maintains the cell_potential. The cell membrane thus works as a selective
filter that allows only certain things to come inside or go outside the cell.
The cell employs a number of transport mechanisms that involve biological
membranes:
1. Passive osmosis and diffusion: Some substances (small molecules, ions) such
as carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2), can move across the plasma membrane by
diffusion, which is a passive transport process. Because the membrane acts as a
barrier for certain molecules and ions, they can occur in different
concentrations on the two sides of the membrane. Diffusion occurs when small
molecules and ions move freely from high concentration to low concentration in
order to equilibrate the membrane. It is considered a passive transport process
because it does not require energy and is propelled by the concentration
gradient created by each side of the membrane.[27] Such a concentration
gradient across a semipermeable membrane sets up an osmotic_flow for the water.
Osmosis, in biological systems involves a solvent, moving through a
semipermeable membrane similarly to passive diffusion as the solvent still
moves with the concentration gradient and requires no energy. While water is
the most common solvent in cell, it can also be other liquids as well as
supercritical liquids and gases.[28]
2. Transmembrane_protein_channels and transporters: Transmembrane proteins
extend through the lipid bilayer of the membranes; they function on both sides
of the membrane to transport molecules across it.[29] Nutrients, such as sugars
or amino acids, must enter the cell, and certain products of metabolism must
leave the cell. Such molecules can diffuse passively through protein channels
such as aquaporins in facilitated_diffusion or are pumped across the membrane
by transmembrane_transporters. Protein channel proteins, also called permeases,
are usually quite specific, and they only recognize and transport a limited
variety of chemical substances, often limited to a single substance. Another
example of a transmembrane protein is a cell-surface receptor, which allow cell
signaling molecules to communicate between cells.[29]
3. Endocytosis: Endocytosis is the process in which cells absorb molecules by
engulfing them. The plasma membrane creates a small deformation inward, called
an invagination, in which the substance to be transported is captured.This
invagination is caused by proteins on the outside on the cell membrane, acting
as receptors and clustering into depressions that eventually promote
accumulation of more proteins and lipids on the cytosolic side of the membrane.
[30] The deformation then pinches off from the membrane on the inside of the
cell, creating a vesicle containing the captured substance. Endocytosis is a
pathway for internalizing solid particles ("cell eating" or phagocytosis),
small molecules and ions ("cell drinking" or pinocytosis), and macromolecules.
Endocytosis requires energy and is thus a form of active transport.
4. Exocytosis: Just as material can be brought into the cell by invagination
and formation of a vesicle, the membrane of a vesicle can be fused with the
plasma membrane, extruding its contents to the surrounding medium. This is the
process of exocytosis. Exocytosis occurs in various cells to remove undigested
residues of substances brought in by endocytosis, to secrete substances such as
hormones and enzymes, and to transport a substance completely across a cellular
barrier. In the process of exocytosis, the undigested waste-containing food
vacuole or the secretory vesicle budded from Golgi_apparatus, is first moved by
cytoskeleton from the interior of the cell to the surface. The vesicle membrane
comes in contact with the plasma membrane. The lipid molecules of the two
bilayers rearrange themselves and the two membranes are, thus, fused. A passage
is formed in the fused membrane and the vesicles discharges its contents
outside the cell
***** Prokaryotes *****
Prokaryotes are divided into two different groups, Archaea and Bacteria, with
bacteria dividing further into gram-positive and gram-negative. Gram-negative
bacteria have both a plasma membrane and an outer_membrane separated by
periplasm, however, other prokaryotes have only a plasma membrane. These two
membranes differ in many aspects. The outer membrane of the gram-negative
bacteria differ from other prokaryotes due to phospholipids forming the
exterior of the bilayer, and lipoproteins and phospholipids forming the
interior.[31] The outer membrane typically has a porous quality due to its
presence of membrane proteins, such as gram-negative porins, which are pore-
forming proteins. The inner, plasma membrane is also generally symmetric
whereas the outer membrane is asymmetric because of proteins such as the
aforementioned. Also, for the prokaryotic membranes, there are multiple things
that can affect the fluidity. One of the major factors that can affect the
fluidity is fatty acid composition. For example, when the bacteria
Staphylococcus aureus was grown in 37â¦C for 24h, the membrane exhibited a
more fluid state instead of a gel-like state. This supports the concept that in
higher temperatures, the membrane is more fluid than in colder temperatures.
When the membrane is becoming more fluid and needs to become more stabilized,
it will make longer fatty acid chains or saturated fatty acid chains in order
to help stabilize the membrane.[32] Bacteria are also surrounded by a cell_wall
composed of peptidoglycan (amino acids and sugars). Some eukaryotic cells also
have cell walls, but none that are made of peptidoglycan. The outer membrane of
gram negative bacteria is rich in lipopolysaccharides, which are combined poly-
or oligosaccharide and carbohydrate lipid regions that stimulate the cellâs
natural immunity.[33] The outer membrane can bleb out into periplasmic
protrusions under stress conditions or upon virulence requirements while
encountering a host target cell, and thus such blebs may work as virulence
organelles.[34] Bacterial cells provide numerous examples of the diverse ways
in which prokaryotic cell membranes are adapted with structures that suit the
organismâs niche. For example, proteins on the surface of certain bacterial
cells aid in their gliding motion.[35] Many gram-negative bacteria have cell
membranes which contain ATP-driven protein exporting systems.[35]
***** Structures *****
**** Fluid mosaic model ****
According to the fluid_mosaic_model of S._J._Singer and G._L._Nicolson (1972),
which replaced the earlier model_of_Davson_and_Danielli, biological membranes
can be considered as a two-dimensional_liquid in which lipid and protein
molecules diffuse more or less easily.[36] Although the lipid bilayers that
form the basis of the membranes do indeed form two-dimensional liquids by
themselves, the plasma membrane also contains a large quantity of proteins,
which provide more structure. Examples of such structures are protein-protein
complexes, pickets and fences formed by the actin-based cytoskeleton, and
potentially lipid_rafts.
**** Lipid bilayer ****
Diagram of the arrangement of amphipathic lipid molecules to form a lipid
bilayer. The yellow polar head groups separate the grey hydrophobic tails from
the aqueous cytosolic and extracellular environments.
Lipid_bilayers form through the process of self-assembly. The cell membrane
consists primarily of a thin layer of amphipathic phospholipids that
spontaneously arrange so that the hydrophobic "tail" regions are isolated from
the surrounding water while the hydrophilic "head" regions interact with the
intracellular (cytosolic) and extracellular faces of the resulting bilayer.
This forms a continuous, spherical lipid_bilayer. Hydrophobic interactions
(also known as the hydrophobic_effect) are the major driving forces in the
formation of lipid bilayers. An increase in interactions between hydrophobic
molecules (causing clustering of hydrophobic regions) allows water molecules to
bond more freely with each other, increasing the entropy of the system. This
complex interaction can include noncovalent interactions such as van_der_Waals,
electrostatic and hydrogen bonds.
Lipid bilayers are generally impermeable to ions and polar molecules. The
arrangement of hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails of the lipid bilayer
prevent polar solutes (ex. amino acids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins,
and ions) from diffusing across the membrane, but generally allows for the
passive diffusion of hydrophobic molecules. This affords the cell the ability
to control the movement of these substances via transmembrane_protein complexes
such as pores, channels and gates. Flippases and scramblases concentrate
phosphatidyl_serine, which carries a negative charge, on the inner membrane.
Along with NANA, this creates an extra barrier to charged moieties moving
through the membrane.
Membranes serve diverse functions in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. One
important role is to regulate the movement of materials into and out of cells.
The phospholipid bilayer structure (fluid mosaic model) with specific membrane
proteins accounts for the selective permeability of the membrane and passive
and active transport mechanisms. In addition, membranes in prokaryotes and in
the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes facilitate the synthesis of ATP
through chemiosmosis.
**** Membrane polarity ****
See also: Epithelial_polarity
Alpha intercalated cell
The apical membrane of a polarized cell is the surface of the plasma membrane
that faces inward to the lumen. This is particularly evident in epithelial and
endothelial_cells, but also describes other polarized cells, such as neurons.
The basolateral_membrane of a polarized cell is the surface of the plasma
membrane that forms its basal and lateral surfaces. It faces outwards, towards
the interstitium, and away from the lumen. Basolateral membrane is a compound
phrase referring to the terms "basal (base) membrane" and "lateral (side)
membrane", which, especially in epithelial cells, are identical in composition
and activity. Proteins (such as ion channels and pumps) are free to move from
the basal to the lateral surface of the cell or vice versa in accordance with
the fluid_mosaic_model. Tight_junctions join epithelial cells near their apical
surface to prevent the migration of proteins from the basolateral membrane to
the apical membrane. The basal and lateral surfaces thus remain roughly
equivalent[clarification_needed] to one another, yet distinct from the apical
surface.
**** Membrane structures ****
Diagram of the Cell Membrane's structures and their function.
Cell membrane can form different types of "supramembrane" structures such as
caveola, postsynaptic_density, podosome, invadopodium, focal_adhesion, and
different types of cell_junctions. These structures are usually responsible for
cell_adhesion, communication, endocytosis and exocytosis. They can be
visualized by electron_microscopy or fluorescence_microscopy. They are composed
of specific proteins, such as integrins and cadherins.
**** Cytoskeleton ****
The cytoskeleton is found underlying the cell membrane in the cytoplasm and
provides a scaffolding for membrane proteins to anchor to, as well as forming
organelles that extend from the cell. Indeed, cytoskeletal elements interact
extensively and intimately with the cell membrane.[37] Anchoring proteins
restricts them to a particular cell surface — for example, the apical surface
of epithelial cells that line the vertebrate gut — and limits how far they may
diffuse within the bilayer. The cytoskeleton is able to form appendage-like
organelles, such as cilia, which are microtubule-based extensions covered by
the cell membrane, and filopodia, which are actin-based extensions. These
extensions are ensheathed in membrane and project from the surface of the cell
in order to sense the external environment and/or make contact with the
substrate or other cells. The apical surfaces of epithelial cells are dense
with actin-based finger-like projections known as microvilli, which increase
cell surface area and thereby increase the absorption rate of nutrients.
Localized decoupling of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane results in formation
of a bleb.
**** Intracellular membranes ****
The content of the cell, inside the cell membrane, is composed of numerous
membrane-bound organelles, which contribute to the overall function of the
cell. The origin, structure, and function of each organelle leads to a large
variation in the cell composition due to the individual uniqueness associated
with each organelle.
    * Mitochondria and chloroplasts are considered to have evolved from
      bacteria, known as the endosymbiotic_theory. This theory arose from the
      idea that Paracoccus and Rhodopseaudomonas, types of bacteria, share
      similar functions to mitochondria and blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria,
      share similar functions to chloroplasts. The endosymbiotic_theory
      proposes that through the course of evolution, a eukaryotic cell engulfed
      these 2 types of bacteria, leading to the formation of mitochondria and
      chloroplasts inside eukaryotic cells. This engulfment lead to the 2
      membranes systems of these organelles in which the outer membrane
      originated from the host's plasma membrane and the inner membrane was the
      endosymbiont's plasma membrane. Considering that mitochondria and
      chloroplasts both contain their own DNA is further support that both of
      these organelles evolved from engulfed bacteria that thrived inside a
      eukaryotic cell.[38]
    * In eukaryotic cells, the nuclear_membrane separates the contents of the
      nucleus from the cytoplasm of the cell.[39] The nuclear membrane is
      formed by an inner and outer membrane, providing the strict regulation of
      materials in to and out of the nucleus. Materials move between the
      cytosol and the nucleus through nuclear_pores in the nuclear membrane. If
      a cellâs nucleus is more active in transcription, its membrane will
      have more pores. The protein composition of the nucleus can vary greatly
      from the cytosol as many proteins are unable to cross through pores via
      diffusion. Within the nuclear membrane, the inner and outer membranes
      vary in protein composition, and only the outer membrane is continuous
      with the endoplasmic_reticulum (ER) membrane. Like the ER, the outer
      membrane also possesses ribosomes responsible for producing and
      transporting proteins into the space between the two membranes. The
      nuclear membrane disassembles during the early stages of mitosis and
      reassembles in later stages of mitosis.[40]
    * The ER, which is part of the endomembrane system, which makes up a very
      large portion of the cell's total membrane content. The ER is an enclosed
      network of tubules and sacs, and its main functions include protein
      synthesis, and lipid metabolism. There are 2 types of ER, smooth and
      rough. The rough ER has ribosomes attached to it used for protein
      synthesis, while the smooth ER is used more for the processing of toxins
      and calcium regulation in the cell.[41]
    * The Golgi_apparatus has two interconnected round Golgi cisternae.
      Compartments of the apparatus forms multiple tubular-reticular networks
      responsible for organization, stack connection and cargo transport that
      display a continuous grape-like stringed vesicles ranging from 50-60 nm.
      The apparatus consists of three main compartments, a flat disc-shaped
      cisterna with tubular-reticular networks and vesicles.[42]
**** Variations ****
The cell membrane has different lipid and protein compositions in distinct
types_of_cells and may have therefore specific names for certain cell types.
    * Sarcolemma in myocytes: âSarcolemmaâ is the name given to the cell
      membrane of myocytes (also known as muscle cells).[43] Although the
      sarcolemma is similar to other cell membranes, it has other functions
      that set it apart. For instance, the sarcolemma transmits synaptic
      signals, helps generate action potentials, and is very involved in muscle
      contractions.[44] Unlike other cell membranes, the sarcolemma makes up
      small channels called ât-tubulesâ that pass through the entirety of
      muscle cells. It has also been found that the average sarcolemma is 10 m
      thick as opposed to the 4 m thickness of a general cell membrane.[45][43]
    * Oolemma is the cell membrane in oocytes: The oolemma of oocytes,
      (immature egg cells) are not consistent with a lipid bilayer as they lack
      a bilayer and do not consist of lipids.[46] Rather, the structure has an
      inner layer, the fertilization envelope, and the exterior is made up of
      the vitelline layer, which is made up of glycoproteins; however, channels
      and proteins are still present for their functions in the membrane.
    * Axolemma: The specialized plasma membrane on the axons of nerve cells
      that is responsible for the generation of the action potential. It
      consists of a granular, densely packed lipid bilayer that works closely
      with the cytoskeleton components spectrin and actin. These cytoskeleton
      components are able to bind to and interact with transmembrane proteins
      in the axolemma.[47][48]
***** Permeability *****
See also: Intestinal_permeability
The permeability of a membrane is the rate of passive diffusion of molecules
through the membrane. These molecules are known as permeant molecules.
Permeability depends mainly on the electric_charge and polarity of the molecule
and to a lesser extent the molar_mass of the molecule. Due to the cell
membrane's hydrophobic nature, small electrically neutral molecules pass
through the membrane more easily than charged, large ones. The inability of
charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane results in pH_partition of
substances throughout the fluid_compartments of the body.
