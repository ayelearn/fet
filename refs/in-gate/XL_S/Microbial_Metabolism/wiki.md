Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Microbial metabolism is the means by which a microbe obtains the energy and
nutrients (e.g. carbon) it needs to live and reproduce. Microbes use many
different types of metabolic strategies and species can often be differentiated
from each other based on metabolic characteristics. The specific metabolic
properties of a microbe are the major factors in determining that microbe's
ecological_niche, and often allow for that microbe to be useful in industrial
processes or responsible for biogeochemical cycles.

Flow chart to determine the metabolic characteristics of microorganisms
Main article: Primary_nutritional_groups
All microbial metabolisms can be arranged according to three principles:
1. How the organism obtains carbon for synthesising cell mass:
    * autotrophic â carbon is obtained from carbon_dioxide (CO
      2)
    * heterotrophic â carbon is obtained from organic_compounds
    * mixotrophic â carbon is obtained from both organic compounds and by
      fixing carbon dioxide
2. How the organism obtains reducing_equivalents used either in energy
conservation or in biosynthetic reactions:
    * lithotrophic â reducing equivalents are obtained from inorganic
      compounds
    * organotrophic â reducing equivalents are obtained from organic
      compounds
3. How the organism obtains energy for living and growing:
    * chemotrophic â energy is obtained from external chemical_compounds
    * phototrophic â energy is obtained from light
In practice, these terms are almost freely combined. Typical examples are as
follows:
    * chemolithoautotrophs obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic
      compounds and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide. Examples:
      Nitrifying_bacteria, Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, Iron-oxidizing_bacteria,
      Knallgas-bacteria
    * photolithoautotrophs obtain energy from light and carbon from the
      fixation of carbon dioxide, using reducing equivalents from inorganic
      compounds. Examples: Cyanobacteria (water (H
      2O) as reducing equivalent donor), Chlorobiaceae, Chromatiaceae (hydrogen
      sulfide (
      H
      2S
      ) as reducing equivalent donor), Chloroflexus (hydrogen (H
      2) as reducing equivalent donor)
    * chemolithoheterotrophs obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic
      compounds, but cannot fix carbon dioxide (CO
      2). Examples: some Thiobacilus, some Beggiatoa, some Nitrobacter spp.,
      Wolinella (with H
      2 as reducing equivalent donor), some Knallgas-bacteria, some sulfate-
      reducing_bacteria
    * chemoorganoheterotrophs obtain energy, carbon, and reducing equivalents
      for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Examples: most
      bacteria, e. g. Escherichia_coli, Bacillus spp., Actinobacteria
    * photoorganoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, carbon and reducing
      equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Some
      species are strictly heterotrophic, many others can also fix carbon
      dioxide and are mixotrophic. Examples: Rhodobacter, Rhodopseudomonas,
      Rhodospirillum, Rhodomicrobium, Rhodocyclus, Heliobacterium, Chloroflexus
      (alternatively to photolithoautotrophy with hydrogen)
***** Heterotrophic microbial metabolism[edit] *****
Some microbes are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic),
using organic compounds as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic
microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as
commensals or parasites) or find in dead organic matter of all kind
(saprophages). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily
decay of all organisms after death. Many eukaryotic microorganisms are
heterotrophic by predation or parasitism, properties also found in some
bacteria such as Bdellovibrio (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria,
causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as Myxococcus (predators of
other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single
cells of Myxobacteria). Most pathogenic bacteria can be viewed as heterotrophic
parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic
microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown
of large organic polymers such as cellulose, chitin or lignin which are
generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large
polymers to carbon dioxide (mineralization) requires several different
organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers,
one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-
products, and one able to use the excreted wastes. There are many variations on
this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and
secrete different waste products. Some organisms are even able to degrade more
recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them
useful in bioremediation.
Biochemically, prokaryotic heterotrophic metabolism is much more versatile than
that of eukaryotic organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic
metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using glycolysis (also called EMP
pathway) for sugar metabolism and the citric_acid_cycle to degrade acetate,
producing energy in the form of ATP and reducing power in the form of NADH or
quinols. These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved
in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth
(sometimes in reverse direction). However, many bacteria and archaea utilize
alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate
pathway (also called ED_pathway) in Pseudomonas. Moreover, there is a third
alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the pentose
phosphate_pathway. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a
large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary
history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes. It is also
noteworthy that the mitochondrion, the small membrane-bound intracellular
organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the
endosymbiosis of a bacterium related to obligate intracellular Rickettsia, and
also to plant-associated Rhizobium or Agrobacterium. Therefore, it is not
surprising that all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with
these Proteobacteria. Most microbes respire (use an electron_transport_chain),
although oxygen is not the only terminal_electron_acceptor that may be used. As
discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has
important biogeochemical consequences.
***** Fermentation[edit] *****
Main article: Fermentation_(biochemistry)
Fermentation is a specific type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses organic
carbon instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. This means that these
organisms do not use an electron transport chain to oxidize NADH to NAD+
 and therefore must have an alternative method of using this reducing power and
maintaining a supply of NAD+
 for the proper functioning of normal metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis). As
oxygen is not required, fermentative organisms are anaerobic. Many organisms
can use fermentation under anaerobic conditions and aerobic_respiration when
oxygen is present. These organisms are facultative_anaerobes. To avoid the
overproduction of NADH, obligately fermentative organisms usually do not have a
complete citric acid cycle. Instead of using an ATP_synthase as in respiration,
ATP in fermentative organisms is produced by substrate-level_phosphorylation
where a phosphate group is transferred from a high-energy organic compound to
ADP to form ATP. As a result of the need to produce high energy phosphate-
containing organic compounds (generally in the form of Coenzyme_A-esters)
fermentative organisms use NADH and other cofactors to produce many different
reduced metabolic by-products, often including hydrogen gas (H
2). These reduced organic compounds are generally small organic_acids and
alcohols derived from pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis. Examples include
ethanol, acetate, lactate, and butyrate. Fermentative organisms are very
important industrially and are used to make many different types of food
products. The different metabolic end products produced by each specific
bacterial species are responsible for the different tastes and properties of
each food.
Not all fermentative organisms use substrate-level phosphorylation. Instead,
some organisms are able to couple the oxidation of low-energy organic compounds
directly to the formation of a proton_(or_sodium)_motive_force and therefore
ATP_synthesis. Examples of these unusual forms of fermentation include
succinate fermentation by Propionigenium_modestum and oxalate fermentation by
Oxalobacter_formigenes. These reactions are extremely low-energy yielding.
Humans and other higher animals also use fermentation to produce lactate from
excess NADH, although this is not the major form of metabolism as it is in
fermentative microorganisms.
***** Special metabolic properties[edit] *****
**** Methylotrophy[edit] ****
Methylotrophy refers to the ability of an organism to use C1-compounds as
energy sources. These compounds include methanol, methyl_amines, formaldehyde,
and formate. Several other less common substrates may also be used for
metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs
include the bacteria Methylomonas and Methylobacter. Methanotrophs are a
specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use methane (CH
4) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol (CH
3OH), formaldehyde (CH
2O), formate (HCOOâ
), and carbon dioxide CO
2 initially using the enzyme methane_monooxygenase. As oxygen is required for
this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are obligate_aerobes. Reducing
power in the form of quinones and NADH is produced during these oxidations to
produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation. Methylotrophs and
methanotrophs are not considered as autotrophic, because they are able to
incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular
carbon before it is completely oxidized to CO
2 (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the serine_pathway
(Methylosinus, Methylocystis) or the ribulose_monophosphate_pathway
(Methylococcus), depending on the species of methylotroph.
In addition to aerobic methylotrophy, methane can also be oxidized
anaerobically. This occurs by a consortium of sulfate-reducing bacteria and
relatives of methanogenic Archaea working syntrophically (see below). Little is
currently known about the biochemistry and ecology of this process.
Methanogenesis is the biological production of methane. It is carried out by
methanogens, strictly anaerobic Archaea such as Methanococcus,
Methanocaldococcus, Methanobacterium, Methanothermus, Methanosarcina,
Methanosaeta and Methanopyrus. The biochemistry of methanogenesis is unique in
nature in its use of a number of unusual cofactors to sequentially reduce
methanogenic substrates to methane, such as coenzyme_M and methanofuran.[1]
These cofactors are responsible (among other things) for the establishment of a
proton gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis.
Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds
oxidized. Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide (CO
2) to methane (CH
4) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas (H
2) chemolithoautotrophically. These methanogens can often be found in
environments containing fermentative organisms. The tight association of
methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see
below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen,
relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess
hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth. This type of syntrophic
relationship is specifically known as interspecies_hydrogen_transfer. A second
group of methanogens use methanol (CH
3OH) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are chemoorganotrophic, but still
autotrophic in using CO
2 as only carbon source. The biochemistry of this process is quite different
from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens. Lastly, a third group of
methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from acetate (CH
3COOâ
) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving
organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens. All autotrophic
methanogens use a variation of the reductive_acetyl-CoA_pathway to fix CO
2 and obtain cellular carbon.
**** Syntrophy[edit] ****
Syntrophy, in the context of microbial metabolism, refers to the pairing of
multiple species to achieve a chemical_reaction that, on its own, would be
energetically unfavorable. The best studied example of this process is the
oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, ethanol and butyrate)
by organisms such as Syntrophomonas. Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to
acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable. However, when a
hydrogenotrophic (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen
gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10â5 atm)
and thereby shift the equilibrium of the butyrate oxidation reaction under
standard conditions (ÎGÂºâ) to non-standard conditions (ÎGâ). Because the
concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is "pulled" towards the
products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for
butyrate oxidation: ÎGÂºâ= +48.2 kJ/mol, but ÎG' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10â5
atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further
metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from
methanogenesis is lowered from ÎGÂºâ= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions
to ÎG' = -17 kJ/mol at 10â5 atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies
hydrogen transfer. In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used
by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual
mineralization of these compounds. These reactions help prevent the excess
sequestration of carbon over geologic time scales, releasing it back to the
biosphere in usable forms such as methane and CO
2.
***** Anaerobic respiration[edit] *****
While aerobic_organisms during respiration use oxygen as a terminal_electron
acceptor, anaerobic_organisms use other electron acceptors. These inorganic
compounds have a lower reduction potential than oxygen, meaning that
respiration is less efficient in these organisms and leads to slower growth
rates than aerobes. Many facultative_anaerobes can use either oxygen or
alternative terminal electron acceptors for respiration depending on the
environmental conditions.
Most respiring anaerobes are heterotrophs, although some do live
autotrophically. All of the processes described below are dissimilative,
meaning that they are used during energy production and not to provide
nutrients for the cell (assimilative). Assimilative pathways for many forms of
anaerobic_respiration are also known.
**** Denitrification â nitrate as electron acceptor[edit] ****
Main article: Denitrification
Denitrification is the utilization of nitrate (NOâ
3) as a terminal electron acceptor. It is a widespread process that is used by
many members of the Proteobacteria. Many facultative anaerobes use
denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential.
Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric iron (Fe3+
) and some organic electron_acceptors. Denitrification involves the stepwise
reduction of nitrate to nitrite (NOâ
2), nitric_oxide (NO), nitrous_oxide (N
2O), and dinitrogen (N
2) by the enzymes nitrate_reductase, nitrite_reductase, nitric oxide reductase,
and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively. Protons are transported across the
membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase
to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration. Some
organisms (e.g. E._coli) only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can
accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite.
Others (e.g. Paracoccus_denitrificans or Pseudomonas_stutzeri) reduce nitrate
completely. Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process
because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide)
are important greenhouse_gases that react with sunlight and ozone to produce
nitric acid, a component of acid_rain. Denitrification is also important in
biological wastewater treatment where it is used to reduce the amount of
nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing eutrophication.
Denitrification can be determined via a nitrate_reductase_test.
**** Sulfate reduction â sulfate as electron acceptor[edit] ****
Main article: Sulfate-reducing_bacteria
Dissimilatory_sulfate_reduction is a relatively energetically poor process used
by many Gram-negative bacteria found within the deltaproteobacteria, Gram-
positive organisms relating to Desulfotomaculum or the archaeon Archaeoglobus.
Hydrogen_sulfide (H
2S) is produced as a metabolic end product. For sulfate reduction electron
donors and energy are needed.
*** Electron donors[edit] ***
Many sulfate reducers are organotrophic, using carbon compounds such as lactate
and pyruvate (among many others) as electron_donors,[2] while others are
lithotrophic, using hydrogen gas (H
2) as an electron donor.[3] Some unusual autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria
(e.g. Desulfotignum_phosphitoxidans) can use phosphite (HPOâ
3) as an electron donor[4] whereas others (e.g. Desulfovibrio_sulfodismutans,
Desulfocapsa_thiozymogenes, Desulfocapsa_sulfoexigens) are capable of sulfur
disproportionation (splitting one compound into two different compounds, in
this case an electron donor and an electron acceptor) using elemental sulfur
(S0), sulfite (SO2â
3), and thiosulfate (S
2O2â
3) to produce both hydrogen sulfide (H
2S) and sulfate (SO2â
4).[5]
*** Energy for reduction[edit] ***
All sulfate-reducing organisms are strict anaerobes. Because sulfate is
energetically stable, before it can be metabolized it must first be activated
by adenylation to form APS (adenosine 5â-phosphosulfate) thereby consuming
ATP. The APS is then reduced by the enzyme APS reductase to form sulfite
(SO2â
3) and AMP. In organisms that use carbon compounds as electron donors, the ATP
consumed is accounted for by fermentation of the carbon substrate. The hydrogen
produced during fermentation is actually what drives respiration during sulfate
reduction.
**** Acetogenesis â carbon dioxide as electron acceptor[edit] ****
Main article: Acetogenesis
Acetogenesis is a type of microbial metabolism that uses hydrogen (H
2) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide (CO
2) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and
acceptors used in methanogenesis (see above). Bacteria that can autotrophically
synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens. Carbon dioxide reduction in all
homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway. This pathway is also used for
carbon fixation by autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic
methanogens. Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen
and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate,
which is secreted as an end product.
**** Other inorganic electron acceptors[edit] ****
Ferric iron (Fe3+
) is a widespread anaerobic terminal electron acceptor both for autotrophic and
heterotrophic organisms. Electron flow in these organisms is similar to those
in electron_transport, ending in oxygen or nitrate, except that in ferric iron-
reducing organisms the final enzyme in this system is a ferric iron reductase.
Model organisms include Shewanella_putrefaciens and Geobacter_metallireducens.
Since some ferric iron-reducing bacteria (e.g. G. metallireducens) can use
toxic hydrocarbons such as toluene as a carbon source, there is significant
interest in using these organisms as bioremediation agents in ferric iron-rich
contaminated aquifers.
Although ferric iron is the most prevalent inorganic electron acceptor, a
number of organisms (including the iron-reducing bacteria mentioned above) can
use other inorganic ions in anaerobic respiration. While these processes may
often be less significant ecologically, they are of considerable interest for
bioremediation, especially when heavy_metals or radionuclides are used as
electron acceptors. Examples include:
    * Manganic_ion (Mn4+
      ) reduction to manganous_ion (Mn2+
      )
    * Selenate (SeO2â
      4) reduction to selenite (SeO2â
      3) and selenite reduction to inorganic selenium (Se0)
    * Arsenate (AsO3â
      4) reduction to arsenite (AsO3â
      3)
    * Uranyl_ion ion (UO2+
      2) reduction to uranium_dioxide (UO
      2)
**** Organic terminal electron acceptors[edit] ****
A number of organisms, instead of using inorganic compounds as terminal
electron acceptors, are able to use organic compounds to accept electrons from
respiration. Examples include:
    * Fumarate reduction to succinate
    * Trimethylamine_N-oxide (TMAO) reduction to trimethylamine (TMA)
    * Dimethyl_sulfoxide (DMSO) reduction to Dimethyl_sulfide (DMS)
    * Reductive dechlorination
TMAO is a chemical commonly produced by fish, and when reduced to TMA produces
a strong odor. DMSO is a common marine and freshwater chemical which is also
odiferous when reduced to DMS. Reductive dechlorination is the process by which
chlorinated organic compounds are reduced to form their non-chlorinated
endproducts. As chlorinated organic compounds are often important (and
difficult to degrade) environmental pollutants, reductive dechlorination is an
important process in bioremediation.
***** Chemolithotrophy[edit] *****
Chemolithotrophy is a type of metabolism where energy is obtained from the
oxidation of inorganic compounds. Most chemolithotrophic organisms are also
autotrophic. There are two major objectives to chemolithotrophy: the generation
of energy (ATP) and the generation of reducing power (NADH).
**** Hydrogen oxidation[edit] ****
Main article: Hydrogen_oxidizing_bacteria
Many organisms are capable of using hydrogen (H
2) as a source of energy. While several mechanisms of anaerobic hydrogen
oxidation have been mentioned previously (e.g. sulfate reducing- and acetogenic
bacteria), hydrogen can also be used as an energy source aerobically in the
knallgas reaction:[6]
      2 H2 + O2 â 2 H2O + energy
In these organisms, hydrogen is oxidized by a membrane-bound hydrogenase
causing proton pumping via electron transfer to various quinones and
cytochromes. In many organisms, a second cytoplasmic hydrogenase is used to
generate reducing power in the form of NADH, which is subsequently used to fix
carbon dioxide via the Calvin_cycle. Hydrogen-oxidizing organisms, such as
Cupriavidus necator (formerly Ralstonia_eutropha), often inhabit oxic-anoxic
interfaces in nature to take advantage of the hydrogen produced by anaerobic
fermentative organisms while still maintaining a supply of oxygen.
**** Sulfur oxidation[edit] ****
Sulfur oxidation involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as
sulfide H
2S), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate (S
2O2â
3) to form sulfuric_acid (H
2SO
4). A classic example of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is Beggiatoa, a microbe
originally described by Sergei_Winogradsky, one of the founders of
environmental_microbiology. Another example is Paracoccus. Generally, the
oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored
either inside or outside of the cell until needed. This two step process occurs
because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur
or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated
across the membrane. Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for
carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using reverse_electron_flow, an
energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their thermodynamic
gradient to produce NADH. Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted
to sulfite (SO2â
3) and subsequently converted to sulfate (SO2â
4) by the enzyme sulfite_oxidase.[7] Some organisms, however, accomplish the
same oxidation using a reversal of the APS reductase system used by sulfate-
reducing bacteria (see above). In all cases the energy liberated is transferred
to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production.[7] In addition to
aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. Thiobacillus_denitrificans) use
nitrate (NOâ
3) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.
Ferrous iron (Fe2+
) oxidation[edit]
Further information: Acidophiles_in_acid_mine_drainage
Ferrous_iron is a soluble form of iron that is stable at extremely low pHs or
under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron
is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric (Fe3+
) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble ferric_hydroxide (Fe(OH)
3). There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes. The
first are acidophiles, such as the bacteria Acidithiobacillus_ferrooxidans and
Leptospirillum_ferrooxidans, as well as the archaeon Ferroplasma. These
microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important
in acid_mine_drainage. The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at
near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example Gallionella_ferruginea,
Leptothrix_ochracea, or Mariprofundus_ferrooxydans) live at the oxic-anoxic
interfaces and are microaerophiles. The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes
are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas,[8] which use
ferrous iron to produce NADH for autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.
Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process
which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme
rusticyanin to facilitate the formation of proton motive force. Like sulfur
oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon
dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.
**** Nitrification[edit] ****
Nitrification is the process by which ammonia (NH
3) is converted to nitrate (NOâ
3). Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes:
oxidation of ammonia to nitrite (NOâ
2) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. Nitrosomonas) and oxidation of nitrite to
nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Nitrobacter). Both of these
processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates
for both types of organisms. Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the
stepwise oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine (NH
2OH) by the enzyme ammonia_monooxygenase in the cytoplasm, followed by the
oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme hydroxylamine
oxidoreductase in the periplasm.
Electron and proton cycling are very complex but as a net result only one
proton is translocated across the membrane per molecule of ammonia oxidized.
Nitrite oxidation is much simpler, with nitrite being oxidized by the enzyme
nitrite_oxidoreductase coupled to proton translocation by a very short electron
transport chain, again leading to very low growth rates for these organisms.
Oxygen is required in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation, meaning that both
nitrosifying and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are aerobes. As in sulfur and iron
oxidation, NADH for carbon dioxide fixation using the Calvin cycle is generated
by reverse electron flow, thereby placing a further metabolic burden on an
already energy-poor process.
In 2015, two groups independently showed the microbial genus Nitrospira is
capable of complete nitrification (Comammox).[9][10]
**** Anammox[edit] ****
Anammox stands for anaerobic ammonia oxidation and the organisms responsible
were relatively recently discovered, in the late 1990s.[11] This form of
metabolism occurs in members of the Planctomycetes (e.g. Candidatus Brocadia
anammoxidans) and involves the coupling of ammonia oxidation to nitrite
reduction. As oxygen is not required for this process, these organisms are
strict anaerobes. Amazingly, hydrazine (N
2H
4 â rocket fuel) is produced as an intermediate during anammox metabolism. To
deal with the high toxicity of hydrazine, anammox bacteria contain a hydrazine-
containing intracellular organelle called the anammoxasome, surrounded by
highly compact (and unusual) ladderane lipid membrane. These lipids are unique
in nature, as is the use of hydrazine as a metabolic intermediate. Anammox
organisms are autotrophs although the mechanism for carbon dioxide fixation is
unclear. Because of this property, these organisms could be used to remove
nitrogen in industrial_wastewater_treatment processes.[12] Anammox has also
been shown to have widespread occurrence in anaerobic aquatic systems and has
been speculated to account for approximately 50% of nitrogen gas production in
the ocean.[13]
***** Phototrophy[edit] *****
Main article: Phototrophic_prokaryotes
Many microbes (phototrophs) are capable of using light as a source of energy to
produce ATP and organic_compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.
Of these, algae are particularly significant because they are oxygenic, using
water as an electron_donor for electron transfer during photosynthesis.[14]
Phototrophic bacteria are found in the phyla Cyanobacteria, Chlorobi,
Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes.[15] Along with plants these
microbes are responsible for all biological generation of oxygen gas on Earth.
Because chloroplasts were derived from a lineage of the Cyanobacteria, the
general principles of metabolism in these endosymbionts can also be applied to
chloroplasts.[16] In addition to oxygenic photosynthesis, many bacteria can
also photosynthesize anaerobically, typically using sulfide (H
2S) as an electron donor to produce sulfate. Inorganic sulfur (S
0), thiosulfate (S
2O2â
3) and ferrous iron (Fe2+
) can also be used by some organisms. Phylogenetically, all oxygenic
photosynthetic bacteria are Cyanobacteria, while anoxygenic photosynthetic
bacteria belong to the purple bacteria (Proteobacteria), Green_sulfur_bacteria
(e.g. Chlorobium), Green_non-sulfur_bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus), or the
heliobacteria (Low %G+C Gram positives). In addition to these organisms, some
microbes (e.g. the Archaeon Halobacterium or the bacterium Roseobacter, among
others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme bacteriorhodopsin,
a light-driven proton pump. However, there are no known Archaea that carry out
photosynthesis.[15]
As befits the large diversity of photosynthetic bacteria, there are many
different mechanisms by which light is converted into energy for metabolism.
All photosynthetic organisms locate their photosynthetic_reaction_centers
within a membrane, which may be invaginations of the cytoplasmic_membrane
(Proteobacteria), thylakoid_membranes (Cyanobacteria), specialized antenna
structures called chlorosomes (Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), or the
cytoplasmic membrane itself (heliobacteria). Different photosynthetic bacteria
also contain different photosynthetic pigments, such as chlorophylls and
carotenoids, allowing them to take advantage of different portions of the
electromagnetic_spectrum and thereby inhabit different niches. Some groups of
organisms contain more specialized light-harvesting structures (e.g.
phycobilisomes in Cyanobacteria and chlorosomes in Green sulfur and non-sulfur
bacteria), allowing for increased efficiency in light utilization.
Biochemically, anoxygenic photosynthesis is very different from oxygenic
photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the Z_scheme
of electron flow in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH. Two
different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is
generated both by using cyclic electron flow and the quinone pool. In
anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, electron flow is cyclic, with all electrons
used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction
center. A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool. In
heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed
using the protein ferredoxin, an energetically favorable reaction. In purple
bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse electron flow due to the lower chemical
potential of this reaction center. In all cases, however, a proton motive force
is generated and used to drive ATP production via an ATPase.
Most photosynthetic microbes are autotrophic, fixing carbon dioxide via the
Calvin cycle. Some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus) are
photoheterotrophs, meaning that they use organic carbon compounds as a carbon
source for growth. Some photosynthetic organisms also fix nitrogen (see below).
***** Nitrogen fixation[edit] *****
Main article: Nitrogen_fixation
Nitrogen is an element required for growth by all biological systems. While
extremely common (80% by volume) in the atmosphere, dinitrogen gas (N
2) is generally biologically inaccessible due to its high activation_energy.
Throughout all of nature, only specialized bacteria and Archaea are capable of
nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen gas into ammonia (NH
3), which is easily assimilated by all organisms.[17] These prokaryotes,
therefore, are very important ecologically and are often essential for the
survival of entire ecosystems. This is especially true in the ocean, where
nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are often the only sources of fixed nitrogen, and
in soils, where specialized symbioses exist between legumes and their nitrogen-
fixing partners to provide the nitrogen needed by these plants for growth.
Nitrogen fixation can be found distributed throughout nearly all bacterial
lineages and physiological classes but is not a universal property. Because the
enzyme nitrogenase, responsible for nitrogen fixation, is very sensitive to
oxygen which will inhibit it irreversibly, all nitrogen-fixing organisms must
possess some mechanism to keep the concentration of oxygen low. Examples
include:
    * heterocyst formation (cyanobacteria e.g. Anabaena) where one cell does
      not photosynthesize but instead fixes nitrogen for its neighbors which in
      turn provide it with energy
    * root nodule symbioses (e.g. Rhizobium) with plants that supply oxygen to
      the bacteria bound to molecules of leghaemoglobin
    * anaerobic lifestyle (e.g. Clostridium_pasteurianum)
    * very fast metabolism (e.g. Azotobacter_vinelandii)
The production and activity of nitrogenases is very highly regulated, both
because nitrogen fixation is an extremely energetically expensive process
(16â24 ATP are used per N
2 fixed) and due to the extreme sensitivity of the nitrogenase to oxygen.
