Study of the internal structure of plants
Chloroplasts in leaf cells of the moss Mnium_stellare
Plant anatomy or phytotomy is the general term for the study of the internal
structure of plants. Originally it included plant_morphology, the description
of the physical form and external structure of plants, but since the mid-20th
century plant anatomy has been considered a separate field referring only to
internal plant structure.[1][2] Plant anatomy is now frequently investigated at
the cellular_level, and often involves the sectioning of tissues and
microscopy.[3]

***** Structural divisions[edit] *****
This is a diagram of the anatomy of a plant with labels of structural parts of
the plants and the roots. 1. Shoot system. 2. Root system. 3. Hypocotyl. 4.
Terminal bud. 5. Leaf blade. 6. Internode. 7. Axillary bud. 8. Petiole. 9.
Stem. 10. Node. 11. Tap root. 12. Root hairs. 13. Root tip. 14. Root cap
Some studies of plant anatomy use a systems approach, organized on the basis of
the plant's activities, such as nutrient transport, flowering, pollination,
embryogenesis or seed development. [4] Others are more classically[5] divided
into the following structural categories:
Vascular_tissue of a gooseberry (left) and a vine branch (right) from Grew's
Anatomy of Plants
Root_tip
      Flower anatomy, including study of the Calyx, Corolla, Androecium, and
      Gynoecium
      Leaf_anatomy, including study of the Epidermis, stomata and Palisade
      cells
      Stem anatomy, including Stem_structure and vascular_tissues, buds and
      shoot_apex
      Fruit/Seed anatomy, including structure of the Ovule, Seed, Pericarp and
      Accessory_fruit
      Wood anatomy, including structure of the Bark, Cork, Xylem, Phloem,
      Vascular_cambium, Heartwood_and_sapwood and branch_collar
      Root anatomy, including structure of the Root, root_tip, endodermis
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_botany
About 300 BC Theophrastus wrote a number of plant treatises, only two of which
survive, Enquiry_into_Plants (Î ÎµÏá½¶ ÏÏÏá¿¶Î½ á¼±ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î±), and On
the Causes of Plants (Î ÎµÏá½¶ ÏÏÏá¿¶Î½ Î±á¼°ÏÎ¹á¿¶Î½). He developed
concepts of plant morphology and classification, which did not withstand the
scientific scrutiny of the Renaissance.
A Swiss physician and botanist, Gaspard_Bauhin, introduced binomial
nomenclature into plant taxonomy. He published Pinax theatri botanici in 1596,
which was the first to use this convention for naming of species. His criteria
for classification included natural relationships, or 'affinities', which in
many cases were structural.
It was in the late 1600s that plant anatomy became refined into a modern
science. Italian doctor and microscopist, Marcello_Malpighi, was one of the two
founders of plant anatomy. In 1671 he published his Anatomia Plantarum, the
first major advance in plant physiogamy since Aristotle. The other founder was
the British doctor Nehemiah_Grew. He published An Idea of a Philosophical
History of Plants in 1672 and The Anatomy of Plants in 1682. Grew is credited
with the recognition of plant cells, although he called them 'vesicles' and
'bladders'. He correctly identified and described the sexual organs of plants
(flowers) and their parts.[6]
In the eighteenth century, Carl_Linnaeus established taxonomy based on
structure, and his early work was with plant anatomy. While the exact
structural level which is to be considered to be scientifically valid for
comparison and differentiation has changed with the growth of knowledge, the
basic principles were established by Linnaeus. He published his master work,
Species Plantarum in 1753.
In 1802, French botanist Charles-FranÃ§ois_Brisseau_de_Mirbel, published
TraitÃ© d'anatomie et de physiologie vÃ©gÃ©tale (Treatise on Plant Anatomy and
Physiology) establishing the beginnings of the science of plant cytology.
In 1812, Johann_Jacob_Paul_Moldenhawer published BeytrÃ¤ge zur Anatomie der
Pflanzen, describing microscopic studies of plant tissues.
In 1813 a Swiss botanist, Augustin_Pyrame_de_Candolle, published ThÃ©orie
Ã©lÃ©mentaire de la botanique, in which he argued that plant anatomy, not
physiology, ought to be the sole basis for plant classification. Using a
scientific basis, he established structural criteria for defining and
separating plant genera.
In 1830, Franz_Meyen published Phytotomie, the first comprehensive review of
plant anatomy.
In 1838 German botanist Matthias_Jakob_Schleiden, published Contributions to
Phytogenesis, stating, "the lower plants all consist of one cell, while the
higher plants are composed of (many) individual cells" thus confirming and
continuing Mirbel's work.
A German-Polish botanist, Eduard_Strasburger, described the mitotic process in
plant cells and further demonstrated that new cell nuclei can only arise from
the division of other pre-existing nuclei. His Studien Ã¼ber Protoplasma was
published in 1876.
Gottlieb_Haberlandt, a German botanist, studied plant physiology and classified
plant tissue based upon function. On this basis, in 1884 he published
Physiologische Pflanzenanatomie (Physiological Plant Anatomy) in which he
described twelve types of tissue systems (absorptive, mechanical,
photosynthetic, etc.).
British paleobotanists Dunkinfield_Henry_Scott and William_Crawford_Williamson
described the structures of fossilized plants at the end of the nineteenth
century. Scott's Studies in Fossil Botany was published in 1900.
Following Charles_Darwin's Origin of Species a Canadian botanist, Edward
Charles_Jeffrey, who was studying the comparative anatomy and phylogeny of
different vascular_plant groups, applied the theory to plants using the form
and structure of plants to establish a number of evolutionary lines. He
published his The Anatomy of Woody Plants in 1917.
The growth of comparative plant anatomy was spearheaded by British botanist
Agnes_Arber. She published Water Plants: A Study of Aquatic Angiosperms in
1920, Monocotyledons: A Morphological Study in 1925, and The Gramineae: A Study
of Cereal, Bamboo and Grass in 1934.[7]
Following World_War_II, Katherine_Esau published, Plant Anatomy (1953), which
became the definitive textbook on plant structure in North American
universities and elsewhere, it was still in print as of 2006.[8] She followed
up with her Anatomy of seed plants in 1960.
