The eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Actin_filaments are shown in red, and microtubules
composed of beta tubulin are in green.
A cytoskeleton is present in the cytoplasm of all cells, including bacteria,
and archaea. It is a complex, dynamic network of interlinking protein_filaments
that extends from the cell_nucleus to the cell_membrane.[1] The cytoskeletal
systems of different organisms are composed of similar proteins. In eukaryotes,
the cytoskeletal matrix is a dynamic structure composed of three main proteins,
which are capable of rapid growth or disassembly dependent on the cell's
requirements.[2]
The structure, function and dynamic behavior of the cytoskeleton can be very
different, depending on organism and cell type.[3][4] Even within one cell the
cytoskeleton can change through association with other proteins and the
previous history of the network.[5]
A multitude of functions can be performed by the cytoskeleton. Its primary
function is to give the cell its shape and mechanical resistance to
deformation, and through association with extracellular connective_tissue and
other cells it stabilizes entire tissues.[3][6] The cytoskeleton can also
contract, thereby deforming the cell and the cell's environment and allowing
cells_to_migrate.[5] Moreover, it is involved in many cell_signaling pathways:
in the uptake of extracellular material (endocytosis),[7] segregates
chromosomes during cellular_division,[3] is involved in cytokinesis (the
division of a mother cell into two daughter cells),[4] provides a scaffold to
organize the contents of the cell in space [5] and for intracellular_transport
(for example, the movement of vesicles and organelles within the cell);[3] and
can be a template for the construction of a cell_wall.[3] Furthermore, it forms
specialized structures, such as flagella, cilia, lamellipodia and podosomes.
A large-scale example of an action performed by the cytoskeleton is muscle
contraction. This is carried out by groups of highly specialized cells working
together. A main component in the cytoskeleton that helps show the true
function of this muscle contraction is the microfilament. Microfilaments are
composed of the most abundant cellular protein known as actin.[8] During
contraction of a muscle, within each muscle cell, myosin molecular motors
collectively exert forces on parallel actin filaments. Muscle contraction
starts from nerve impulses which then causes increased amounts of calcium to be
released from the sarcoplasmic_reticulum. Increases in calcium in the cytosol
allows muscle contraction to begin with the help of two proteins, tropomyosin
and troponin.[8] Tropomyosin inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin,
while troponin senses the increase in calcium and releases the inhibition.[9]
This action contracts the muscle cell, and through the synchronous process in
many muscle cells, the entire muscle.

***** History[edit] *****
In 1903, Nikolai_K._Koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by
a network of tubules that he termed the cytoskeleton. The concept of a protein
mosaic that dynamically coordinated cytoplasmic biochemistry was proposed by
Rudolph Peters in 1929[10] while the term (cytosquelette, in French) was first
introduced by French embryologist Paul_Wintrebert in 1931.[11]
When the cytoskeleton was first introduced, it was thought to be an
uninteresting gel-like substance that helps organelles stay in place.[12] Much
research took place to try to understand the purpose of the cytoskeleton and
its components. With the help of Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose, they
discovered that microtubules vibrate within neurons in the brain which suggest
that brain waves come from deeper microtubule vibrations.[13] This discovery
showed that the cytoskeleton is not just a gel like substance but it actually
has a purpose.[disputed  – discuss]
Initially, it was thought that the cytoskeleton was exclusive to eukaryotes but
in 1992, it was discovered to be present in prokaryotes as well. This discovery
came after the realization that bacteria possess proteins that are homologous
to tubulin and actin; the main components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.[14]
***** Eukaryotic cytoskeleton[edit] *****
Actin cytoskeleton of mouse embryo fibroblasts, stained with phalloidin
Eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments:
microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate_filaments. Each type is formed
by the polymerization of a distinct type of protein_subunit and has its own
characteristic shape and intracellular distribution. Microfilaments are
polymers of the protein actin and are 7 nm in diameter. Microtubules are
composed of tubulin and are 25 nm in diameter. Intermediate filaments are
composed of various proteins, depending on the type of cell in which they are
found; they are normally 8-12 nm in diameter.[1] The cytoskeleton provides the
cell with structure and shape, and by excluding macromolecules from some of the
cytosol, it adds to the level of macromolecular_crowding in this compartment.
[15] Cytoskeletal elements interact extensively and intimately with cellular
membranes.[16]
Research into neurodegenerative_disorders such as Parkinson's_disease,
Alzheimer's_disease, Huntington's_disease, and amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis
(ALS) indicate that the cytoskeleton is affected in these diseases. Parkinson's
disease is marked by the degradation of neurons, resulting in tremors,
rigidity, and other non-motor symptoms. Research has shown that microtubule
assembly and stability in the cytoskeleton is compromised causing the neurons
to degrade over time.[17] In Alzheimer's disease, tau_proteins which stabilize
microtubules, malfunction in the progression of the disease, causing pathology
with the cytoskeleton.[18] Excess glutamine in the Huntington protein which is
involved with linking vesicles to the cytoskeleton is also proposed to be a
factor in the development of Huntington's disease.[19] Amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis which results in a loss of movement caused by the degradation of
motor neurons is also seen to involve defects in the cytoskeleton.[20]
A number of small-molecule cytoskeletal_drugs have been discovered that
interact with actin and microtubules. These compounds have proven useful in
studying the cytoskeleton and several have clinical applications.
All filaments interact with accessory proteins that regulate and link the
filaments to other cell compounds and each other. The accessory proteins are
essential for controlled assembly of cytoskeletal filaments in particular
locations, and they include motor_proteins.[21]
**** Microfilaments[edit] ****
Main article: Microfilament
This image shows the structure of a microfilament, which creates the structure
in the cytoskeleton of an eukaryotic cell.
Microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, are composed of linear polymers
of G-actin proteins, and generate force when the growing (plus) end of the
filament pushes against a barrier, such as the cell membrane. They also act as
tracks for the movement of myosin molecules that affix to the microfilament and
"walk" along them. In general, the major component or protein of microfilaments
are actin. The G-actin monomer combines to form a polymer which continues to
form the microfilament (actin filament). These subunits then assemble into two
chains that intertwine into what are called F-actin chains.[22] Myosin motoring
along F-actin filaments generates contractile forces in so-called actomyosin
fibers, both in muscle as well as most non-muscle cell types.[23] Actin
structures are controlled by the Rho_family of small GTP-binding proteins such
as Rho itself for contractile acto-myosin filaments ("stress fibers"), Rac for
lamellipodia and Cdc42 for filopodia.
Functions include:
    * Muscle_contraction
    * Cell movement
    * Intracellular transport/trafficking
    * Maintenance of eukaryotic cell shape
    * Cytokinesis
    * Cytoplasmic streaming[22]
**** Intermediate filaments[edit] ****
Microscopy of keratin filaments inside cells
Main article: Intermediate_filament
This picture shows the structure of an Intermediate Filament, which creates the
structure of the cytoskeleton in an eukaryotic cell.

Intermediate filaments are a part of the cytoskeleton of many eukaryotic cells.
These filaments, averaging 10 nanometers in diameter, are more stable (strongly
bound) than microfilaments, and heterogeneous constituents of the cytoskeleton.
Like actin filaments, they function in the maintenance of cell-shape by bearing
tension (microtubules, by contrast, resist compression but can also bear
tension during mitosis and during the positioning of the centrosome).
Intermediate filaments organize the internal tridimensional structure of the
cell, anchoring organelles and serving as structural components of the nuclear
lamina. They also participate in some cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions.
Nuclear_lamina exist in all animals and all tissues. Some animals like the
fruit_fly do not have any cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. In those animals
that express cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, these are tissue specific.[6]
Keratin intermediate filaments in epithelial cells provide protection for
different mechanical stresses the skin may endure. They also provide protection
for organs against metabolic, oxidative, and chemical stresses. Strengthening
of epithelial cells with these intermediate filaments may prevent onset of
apoptosis, or cell death, by reducing the probability of stress.[24]
Intermediate filaments are most commonly known as the support system or
âscaffoldingâ for the cell and nucleus while also playing a role in some
cell functions. In combination with proteins and desmosomes, the intermediate
filaments form cell-cell connections and anchor the cell-matrix junctions that
are used in messaging between cells as well as vital functions of the cell.
These connections allow the cell to communicate through the desmosome of
multiple cells to adjust structures of the tissue based on signals from the
cells environment. Mutations in the IF proteins have been shown to cause
serious medical issues such as premature aging, desmin mutations compromising
organs, Alexander_Disease, and muscular_dystrophy.[25]
Different intermediate filaments are:
    * made of vimentins. Vimentin intermediate filaments are in general present
      in mesenchymal cells.
    * made of keratin. Keratin is present in general in epithelial cells.
    * neurofilaments of neural cells.
    * made of lamin, giving structural support to the nuclear envelope.
    * made of desmin, play an important role in structural and mechanical
      support of muscle cells.[26]
**** Microtubules[edit] ****
Microtubules in a gel-fixated cell
Main article: Microtubule
Microtubules are hollow cylinders about 23 nm in diameter (lumen =
approximately 15 nm in diameter), most commonly comprising 13 protofilaments
that, in turn, are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin. They have a very dynamic
behavior, binding GTP for polymerization. They are commonly organized by the
centrosome.
This picture shows the structure of a microtubule filament which creates shape
in an eukaryotic cell.
In nine triplet sets (star-shaped), they form the centrioles, and in nine
doublets oriented about two additional microtubules (wheel-shaped), they form
cilia and flagella. The latter formation is commonly referred to as a "9+2"
arrangement, wherein each doublet is connected to another by the protein
dynein. As both flagella and cilia are structural components of the cell, and
are maintained by microtubules, they can be considered part of the
cytoskeleton. There are two types of cilia: motile and non-motile cilia. Cilia
are short and more numerous than flagella. The motile cilia have a rhythmic
waving or beating motion compared to the non-motile cilia which receive sensory
information for the cell; processing signals from the other cells or the fluids
surrounding it. Additionally, the microtubules control the beating (movement)
of the cilia and flagella.[27] Also, the dynein arms attached to the
microtubules function as the molecular motors. The motion of the cilia and
flagella is created by the microtubules sliding past one another, which
requires ATP.[27] They play key roles in:
    * intracellular transport (associated with dyneins and kinesins, they
      transport organelles like mitochondria or vesicles).
    * Cross section diagram through the cilium shows the â9 + 2â
      arrangement of microtubules.
      the axoneme of cilia and flagella.
    * the mitotic_spindle.
    * synthesis of the cell wall in plants.
In addition to the roles described above, Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose
have proposed that microtubules function in consciousness.[28]

**** Septins[edit] ****
Main article: Septin
Septins are a group of the highly conserved GTP binding proteins found in
eukaryotes. Different septins form protein_complexes with each other. These can
assemble to filaments and rings. Therefore, septins can be considered part of
the cytoskeleton.[32] The function of septins in cells include serving as a
localized attachment site for other proteins, and preventing the diffusion of
certain molecules from one cell compartment to another.[32] In yeast cells,
they build scaffolding to provide structural support during cell division and
compartmentalize parts of the cell. Recent research in human cells suggests
that septins build cages around bacterial pathogens, immobilizing the harmful
microbes and preventing them from invading other cells.[33]
**** Spectrin[edit] ****
Main article: Spectrin
Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that lines the intracellular side of the
plasma_membrane in eukaryotic cells. Spectrin forms pentagonal or hexagonal
arrangements, forming a scaffolding and playing an important role in
maintenance of plasma_membrane integrity and cytoskeletal structure.[34]
**** Yeast cytoskeleton[edit] ****
See also: Yeast
In budding yeast (an important model_organism), actin forms cortical patches,
actin cables, and a cytokinetic ring and the cap. Cortical patches are discrete
actin bodies on the membrane and are vital for endocytosis, especially the
recycling of glucan synthase which is important for cell_wall synthesis. Actin
cables are bundles of actin_filaments and are involved in the transport of
vesicles towards the cap (which contains a number of different proteins to
polarize cell growth) and in the positioning of mitochondria. The cytokinetic
ring forms and constricts around the site of cell_division.[35]
***** Prokaryotic cytoskeleton[edit] *****
Main article: Prokaryotic_cytoskeleton
Prior to the work of Jones et al., 2001, the cell wall was believed to be the
deciding factor for many bacterial cell shapes, including rods and spirals.
When studied, many misshapen bacteria were found to have mutations linked to
development of a cell_envelope.[36] The cytoskeleton was once thought to be a
feature only of eukaryotic cells, but homologues to all the major proteins of
the eukaryotic cytoskeleton have been found in prokaryotes.[37] Harold Erickson
notes that before 1992, only eukaryotes were believed to have cytoskeleton
components. However, research in the early '90s suggested that bacteria and
archaea had homologues of actin and tubulin, and that these were the basis of
eukaryotic microtubules and microfilaments.[38] Although the evolutionary
relationships are so distant that they are not obvious from protein sequence
comparisons alone, the similarity of their three-dimensional structures and
similar functions in maintaining cell shape and polarity provides strong
evidence that the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytoskeletons are truly
homologous.[39] Three laboratories independently discovered that FtsZ, a
protein already known as a key player in bacterial cytokinesis, had the
"tubulin signature sequence" present in all Î±-, Î²-, and Î³-tubulins.[38]
However, some structures in the bacterial cytoskeleton may not have been
identified as of yet.[23][40]
**** FtsZ[edit] ****
FtsZ was the first protein of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton to be identified.
Like tubulin, FtsZ forms filaments in the presence of guanosine_triphosphate
(GTP), but these filaments do not group into tubules. During cell_division,
FtsZ is the first protein to move to the division site, and is essential for
recruiting other proteins that synthesize the new cell_wall between the
dividing cells.
**** MreB and ParM[edit] ****
Prokaryotic actin-like proteins, such as MreB, are involved in the maintenance
of cell shape. All non-spherical bacteria have genes encoding actin-like
proteins, and these proteins form a helical network beneath the cell membrane
that guides the proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis.[41]
Some plasmids encode a separate system that involves an actin-like protein
ParM. Filaments of ParM exhibit dynamic_instability, and may partition plasmid
DNA into the dividing daughter cells by a mechanism analogous to that used by
microtubules during eukaryotic mitosis.[23][42]
**** Crescentin[edit] ****
The bacterium Caulobacter_crescentus contains a third protein, crescentin, that
is related to the intermediate filaments of eukaryotic cells. Crescentin is
also involved in maintaining cell shape, such as helical and vibrioid forms of
bacteria, but the mechanism by which it does this is currently unclear.[43]
Additionally, curvature could be described by the displacement of crescentic
filaments, after the disruption of peptidoglycan synthesis.[44]
***** Common features and differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes[edit]
*****
By definition, the cytoskeleton is composed of proteins that can form
longitudinal arrays (fibres) in all organisms. These filament forming proteins
have been classified into 4 classes. Tubulin-like, actin-like, Walker_A
cytoskeletal_ATPases (WACA-proteins), and intermediate_filaments.[4][23]
Tubulin-like proteins are tubulin in eukaryotes and FtsZ, TubZ, RepX in
prokaryotes. Actin-like proteins are actin in eukaryotes and MreB, FtsA in
prokaryotes. An example of a WACA-proteins, which are mostly found in
prokaryotes, is MinD. Examples for intermediate filaments, which have almost
exclusively been found in animals (i.e. eukaryotes) are the lamins, keratins,
vimentin, neurofilaments, and desmin.[4]
Although tubulin-like proteins share some amino_acid_sequence similarity, their
equivalence in protein-fold and the similarity in the GTP binding site is more
striking. The same holds true for the actin-like proteins and their structure
and ATP binding domain.[4][23]
Cytoskeletal proteins are usually correlated with cell shape, DNA segregation
and cell division in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Which proteins fulfill which
task is very different. For example, DNA segregation in all eukaryotes happens
through use of tubulin, but in prokaryotes either WACA proteins, actin-like or
tubulin-like proteins can be used. Cell division is mediated in eukaryotes by
actin, but in prokaryotes usually by tubulin-like (often FtsZ-ring) proteins
and sometimes (Crenarchaeota) ESCRT-III, which in eukaryotes still has a role
in the last step of division.[4]
***** Cytoplasmic streaming[edit] *****
Cytoplasmic_streaming, also known as cylcosis, is the active movement of a
cellâs contents along the components of the cytoskeleton. While mainly seen
in plants, all cell types use this process for transportation of waste,
nutrients, and organelles to other parts of the cell. [45] Plant and algae
cells are generally larger than many other cells; so cytoplasmic streaming is
important in these types of cells. This is because the cellâs extra volume
requires cytoplasmic streaming in order to move organelles throughout the
entire cell.[46] Organelles move along microfilaments in the cytoskeleton
driven by myosin motors binding and pushing along actin filament bundles.[45]
