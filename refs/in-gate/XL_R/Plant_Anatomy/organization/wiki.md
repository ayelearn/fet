***** Types[edit] *****
There are a variety of legal types of organisations, including corporations,
governments, non-governmental_organisations, political_organisations,
international_organisations, armed_forces, charities, not-for-profit
corporations, partnerships, cooperatives, and educational_institutions.
A hybrid_organisation is a body that operates in both the public_sector and the
private_sector simultaneously, fulfilling public duties and developing
commercial market activities.
A voluntary_association is an organisation consisting of volunteers. Such
organisations may be able to operate without legal formalities, depending on
jurisdiction, including informal clubs or coordinating bodies with a goal in
mind which they may express in the form of an Manifesto, Mission_statement,or
in an informal manner reflected in what they do because remember every action
done by an organization both legal and illegal reflects a goal in mind.[1][2]
Organisations may also operate secretly or illegally in the case of secret
societies, criminal_organisations and resistance_movements. And in some cases
may have obstacles from other organizations (ex: MLK's_organization)[3] but
what makes an organization an organization is not the paperwork that makes it
official but to be an organization there must be four things:
   1. A goal in mind
   2. A leader or committee making the decision
   3. action involved
   4. communication and members.
But what makes an organization recognized by the government is either filling
out Incorporation_(business) or recognition in the form of either societal
pressure (ex: Advocacy_group), causing concerns (ex: Resistance_movement) or
being considered the spokesperson of a group of people subject to negotiation
(ex: the Polisario_Front_being_recognized_as_the_sole_representative_of_the
Sahawri_people_and_forming_a_partially_recognized_state.)
Compare the concept of social_groups, which may include non-organizations.[4]
***** Structures[edit] *****

Main article: Organizational_structure
The study of organisations includes a focus on optimising organisational
structure. According to management_science, most human organisations fall
roughly into four types:[citation_needed]
    * Committees or juries
    * Ecologies
    * Matrix organisations
    * Pyramids or hierarchies
**** Committees or juries[edit] ****
These consist of a group of peers who decide as a group, perhaps by voting. The
difference between a jury and a committee is that the members of the committee
are usually assigned to perform or lead further actions after the group comes
to a decision, whereas members of a jury come to a decision. In common_law
countries, legal juries render decisions of guilt, liability and quantify
damages; juries are also used in athletic contests, book awards and similar
activities. Sometimes a selection committee functions like a jury. In the
Middle Ages, juries in continental Europe were used to determine the law
according to consensus among local notables.
Committees are often the most reliable way to make decisions. Condorcet's_jury
theorem proved that if the average member votes better than a roll of dice,
then adding more members increases the number of majorities that can come to a
correct vote (however correctness is defined). The problem is that if the
average member is subsequently worse than a roll of dice, the committee's
decisions grow worse, not better; therefore, staffing is crucial.
Parliamentary procedure, such as Robert's_Rules_of_Order, helps prevent
committees from engaging in lengthy discussions without reaching decisions.
**** Ecologies[edit] ****
This organisational structure promotes internal competition. Inefficient
components of the organisation starve, while effective ones get more work.
Everybody is paid for what they actually do, and so runs a tiny business that
has to show a profit, or they are fired.
Companies who utilise this organisation type reflect a rather one-sided view of
what goes on in ecology. It is also the case that a natural ecosystem has a
natural border - ecoregions do not, in general, compete with one another in any
way, but are very autonomous.
The pharmaceutical_company GlaxoSmithKline talks about functioning as this type
of organisation in this_external_article from The_Guardian. By:Bastian Batac De
Leon.
**** Matrix organisation[edit] ****
See also: Matrix_management
This organisational type assigns each worker two bosses in two different
hierarchies. One hierarchy is "functional" and assures that each type of expert
in the organisation is well-trained, and measured by a boss who is super-expert
in the same field. The other direction is "executive" and tries to get projects
completed using the experts. Projects might be organised by products, regions,
customer types, or some other schemes.
As an example, a company might have an individual with overall responsibility
for products X and Y, and another individual with overall responsibility for
engineering, quality control, etc. Therefore, subordinates responsible for
quality control of project X will have two reporting lines.
**** Pyramids or hierarchical[edit] ****
A hierarchy exemplifies an arrangement with a leader who leads other individual
members of the organisation. This arrangement is often associated with basis
that there are enough imagine a real pyramid, if there are not enough stone
blocks to hold up the higher ones, gravity would irrevocably bring down the
monumental structure. So one can imagine that if the leader does not have the
support of his subordinates, the entire structure will collapse. Hierarchies
were satirised in The_Peter_Principle (1969), a book that introduced
hierarchiology and the saying that "in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise
to his level of incompetence."
***** Theories[edit] *****
See also: Organizational_theory
In the social sciences, organisations are the object of analysis for a number
of disciplines, such as sociology, economics,[5] political_science, psychology,
management, and organisational_communication. The broader analysis of
organisations is commonly referred to as organisational_structure,
organisational_studies, organisational_behaviour, or organisation analysis. A
number of different perspectives exist, some of which are compatible:
    * From a functional perspective, the focus is on how entities like
      businesses or state authorities are used.
    * From an institutional perspective, an organisation is viewed as a
      purposeful structure within a social context.
    * From a process-related perspective, an organisation is viewed as an
      entity is being (re-)organised, and the focus is on the organisation as a
      set of tasks or actions.
Sociology can be defined as the science of the institutions of modernity;
specific institutions serve_a_function, akin to the individual organs of a
coherent body. In the social and political sciences in general, an
"organisation" may be more loosely understood as the planned, coordinated and
purposeful action of human beings working through collective action to reach a
common goal or construct a tangible product. This action is usually framed by
formal membership and form (institutional rules). Sociology distinguishes the
term organisation into planned formal and unplanned informal (i.e.
spontaneously formed) organisations. Sociology analyses organisations in the
first line from an institutional perspective. In this sense, organisation is an
enduring arrangement of elements. These elements and their actions are
determined by rules so that a certain task can be fulfilled through a system of
coordinated division_of_labour.
Economic approaches to organisations also take the division_of_labour as a
starting point. The division of labour allows for (economies of)
specialisation. Increasing specialisation necessitates coordination. From an
economic point of view, markets and organisations are alternative coordination
mechanisms for the execution of transactions.[5]
An organisation is defined by the elements that are part of it (who belongs to
the organisation and who does not?), its communication (which elements
communicate and how do they communicate?), its autonomy (which changes are
executed autonomously by the organisation or its elements?), and its rules of
action compared to outside events (what causes an organisation to act as a
collective actor?).
By coordinated and planned cooperation of the elements, the organisation is
able to solve tasks that lie beyond the abilities of the single elements. The
price paid by the elements is the limitation of the degrees_of_freedom of the
elements. Advantages of organisations are enhancement (more of the same),
addition (combination of different features) and extension. Disadvantages can
be inertness (through co-ordination) and loss of interaction.
Among the theories that are or have been influential are:
    * Activity_theory is the major theoretical influence, acknowledged by de
      Clodomir_Santos_de_Morais in the development of Organisation_Workshop
      method.
    * Actorânetwork_theory, an approach to social theory and research,
      originating in the field of science studies, which treats objects as part
      of social networks.
    * Complexity_theory_and_organisations, the use of complexity_theory in the
      field of strategic_management and organisational studies.
    * Contingency_theory, a class of behavioural theory that claims that there
      is no best way to organize a corporation, to lead a company, or to make
      decisions.
    * Critical_management_studies, a loose but extensive grouping of
      theoretically informed critiques of management, business, and
      organisation, grounded originally in a critical_theory perspective
    * Economic_sociology, studies both the social effects and the social causes
      of various economic phenomena.
    * Enterprise_architecture, the conceptual model that defines the
      coalescence of organisational structure and organisational behaviour.
    * Garbage_Can_Model, describes a model which disconnects problems,
      solutions and decision makers from each other.
    * Principalâagent_problem, concerns the difficulties in motivating one
      party (the "agent"), to act in the best interests of another (the
      "principal") rather than in his or her own interests
    * Scientific_management (mainly following Frederick_W._Taylor), a theory of
      management that analyses and synthesises workflows.
    * Social_entrepreneurship, the process of pursuing innovative solutions to
      social problems.
    * Transaction_cost_theory, the idea that people begin to organise their
      production in firms when the transaction cost of coordinating production
      through the market exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than
      within the firm.
    * Weber's_Ideal_of_Bureaucracy (refer to Max_Weber's chapter on
      "Bureaucracy" in his book Economy_and_Society)
***** Leadership[edit] *****
Main article: Leadership
A leader in a formal, hierarchical_organisation, is appointed to a managerial
position and has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the
authority of his position. However, he must possess adequate personal
attributes to match his authority, because authority is only potentially
available to him. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager
may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge his role in the
organisation and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of
position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields
personal influence and power can legitimise this only by gaining a formal
position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.[6]
**** Formal organisations[edit] ****
An organisation that is established as a means for achieving defined objectives
has been referred to as a formal_organisation. Its design specifies how goals
are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organisation. Divisions,
departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work structure.
Thus, the formal organisation is expected to behave impersonally in regard to
relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's
definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Each
employee receives a salary and enjoys a degree of tenure that safeguards him
from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher
his position in the hierarchy, the greater his presumed expertise in
adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at
lower levels of the organisation. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms
the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions
in the organisation and endows them with the authority attached to their
position.[7]
**** Informal organisations[edit] ****
In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader
emerges within the context of the informal_organisation that underlies the
formal structure. The informal organisation expresses the personal objectives
and goals of the individual membership. Their objectives and goals may or may
not coincide with those of the formal organisation. The informal organisation
represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterise
human life â the spontaneous emergence of groups and organisations as ends in
themselves.[7]
In prehistoric times, man was preoccupied with his personal security,
maintenance, protection, and survival. Now man spends a major portion of his
waking hours working for organisations. His need to identify with a community
that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging
continues unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal
organisation and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.[6]
Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organisation. Their
personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and
other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or
several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an
appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power.
Influence is the ability of a person to gain cooperation from others by means
of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence
because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of
a means of punishment.[6]

      Many of these are enormously important, but they lack an organization's
      purposive activity. Among the more conspicuous 'non-organizations' are
      races and ethnic groups (they have no programs), social classes (their
      collective identities are not unequivocal and their rosters not exact),
      cliques and play groups (they lack a collective identity), interest
      groups such as 'liberals' or 'old-fashioned conservatives' (they have no
