[edit_on_Wikidata]
The circulatory system, also called the cardiovascular system or the vascular
system, is an organ_system that permits blood to circulate and transport
nutrients (such as amino_acids and electrolytes), oxygen, carbon_dioxide,
hormones, and blood_cells to and from the cells in the body to provide
nourishment and help in fighting_diseases, stabilize_temperature and pH, and
maintain homeostasis.
The circulatory system includes the lymphatic_system, which circulates lymph.
[1] The passage of lymph for example takes much longer than that of blood.[2]
Blood is a fluid consisting of plasma, red_blood_cells, white_blood_cells, and
platelets that is circulated by the heart through the vertebrate vascular
system, carrying oxygen and nutrients to and waste materials away from all body
tissues. Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been
filtered from the interstitial_fluid (between cells) and returned to the
lymphatic system. The cardiovascular (from Latin words meaning "heart" and
"vessel") system comprises the blood, heart, and blood_vessels.[3] The lymph,
lymph_nodes, and lymph_vessels form the lymphatic system, which returns
filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid (between cells) as lymph.
The circulatory system of the blood is seen as having two components, a
systemic circulation and a pulmonary circulation.[4]
While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed cardiovascular system
(meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and
capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system. The
lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system providing an accessory
route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood.[5] The more
primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems.
Many diseases affect the circulatory system. This includes cardiovascular
disease, affecting the cardiovascular system, and lymphatic_disease affecting
the lymphatic system. Cardiologists are medical professionals which specialise
in the heart, and cardiothoracic_surgeons specialise in operating on the heart
and its surrounding areas. Vascular_surgeons focus on other parts of the
circulatory system.

***** Structure *****
**** Cardiovascular system ****
Depiction of the heart, major veins and arteries constructed from body scans.
Cross section of a human artery
Relative percentages of cardiac output delivered to major organ systems
The essential components of the human cardiovascular system are the heart,
blood and blood_vessels.[6] It includes the pulmonary_circulation, a "loop"
through the lungs where blood is oxygenated; and the systemic circulation, a
"loop" through the rest of the body to provide oxygenated blood. The systemic
circulation can also be seen to function in two parts â a macrocirculation
and a microcirculation. An average adult contains five to six quarts (roughly
4.7 to 5.7 liters) of blood, accounting for approximately 7% of their total
body weight.[7] Blood consists of plasma, red_blood_cells, white_blood_cells,
and platelets. Also, the digestive_system works with the circulatory system to
provide the nutrients the system needs to keep the heart pumping.[8]
The cardiovascular systems of humans are closed, meaning that the blood never
leaves the network of blood_vessels. In contrast, oxygen and nutrients diffuse
across the blood vessel layers and enter interstitial_fluid, which carries
oxygen and nutrients to the target cells, and carbon dioxide and wastes in the
opposite direction. The other component of the circulatory system, the
lymphatic_system, is open.
*** Arteries ***
See also: Arterial_tree
Oxygenated blood enters the systemic circulation when leaving the left
ventricle, through the aortic_semilunar_valve. The first part of the systemic
circulation is the aorta, a massive and thick-walled artery. The aorta arches
and gives branches supplying the upper part of the body after passing through
the aortic opening of the diaphragm at the level of thoracic ten vertebra, it
enters the abdomen. Later it descends down and supplies branches to abdomen,
pelvis, perineum and the lower limbs. The walls of aorta are elastic. This
elasticity helps to maintain the blood_pressure throughout the body. When the
aorta receives almost five litres of blood from the heart, it recoils and is
responsible for pulsating blood pressure. Moreover, as aorta branches into
smaller arteries, their elasticity goes on decreasing and their compliance goes
on increasing.
*** Capillaries ***
Arteries branch into small passages called arterioles and then into the
capillaries.[9] The capillaries merge to bring blood into the venous system.
[10]
*** Veins ***
Capillaries merge into venules, which merge into veins. The venous system feeds
into the two major veins: the superior_vena_cava – which mainly drains tissues
above the heart – and the inferior_vena_cava – which mainly drains tissues
below the heart. These two large veins empty into the right_atrium of the
heart.
*** Portal veins ***
Main article: Portal_vein
The general rule is that arteries from the heart branch out into capillaries,
which collect into veins leading back to the heart. Portal_veins are a slight
exception to this. In humans the only significant example is the hepatic_portal
vein which combines from capillaries around the gastrointestinal_tract where
the blood absorbs the various products of digestion; rather than leading
directly back to the heart, the hepatic portal vein branches into a second
capillary system in the liver.
*** Heart ***
Main article: Heart
View from the front
The heart pumps oxygenated blood to the body and deoxygenated blood to the
lungs. In the human heart there is one atrium and one ventricle for each
circulation, and with both a systemic and a pulmonary circulation there are
four chambers in total: left_atrium, left_ventricle, right_atrium and right
ventricle. The right atrium is the upper chamber of the right side of the
heart. The blood that is returned to the right atrium is deoxygenated (poor in
oxygen) and passed into the right ventricle to be pumped through the pulmonary
artery to the lungs for re-oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The left
atrium receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs as well as the pulmonary
vein which is passed into the strong left ventricle to be pumped through the
aorta to the different organs of the body.
*** Coronary vessels ***
Main article: Coronary_circulation
The heart itself is supplied with oxygen and nutrients through a small "loop"
of the systemic circulation and derives very little from the blood contained
within the four chambers. The coronary circulation system provides a blood
supply to the heart_muscle itself. The coronary circulation begins near the
origin of the aorta by two coronary_arteries: the right_coronary_artery and the
left_coronary_artery. After nourishing the heart muscle, blood returns through
the coronary veins into the coronary_sinus and from this one into the right
atrium. Back flow of blood through its opening during atrial_systole is
prevented by the Thebesian_valve. The smallest_cardiac_veins drain directly
into the heart chambers.[8]
*** Lungs ***
The pulmonary circulation as it passes from the heart. Showing both the
pulmonary and bronchial_arteries.
Main article: Pulmonary_circulation
The circulatory_system_of_the_lungs is the portion of the cardiovascular system
in which oxygen-depleted blood is pumped away from the heart, via the pulmonary
artery, to the lungs and returned, oxygenated, to the heart via the pulmonary
vein.
Oxygen deprived blood from the superior and inferior vena_cava enters the right
atrium of the heart and flows through the tricuspid_valve (right
atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle, from which it is then pumped
through the pulmonary_semilunar_valve into the pulmonary artery to the lungs.
Gas_exchange occurs in the lungs, whereby CO
2 is released from the blood, and oxygen is absorbed. The pulmonary vein
returns the now oxygen-rich blood to the left_atrium.[8]
A separate system known as the bronchial_circulation supplies blood to the
tissue of the larger airways of the lung.
*** Systemic circulation ***
The systemic circulation and capillary networks shown and also as separate from
the pulmonary circulation
Systemic circulation is the portion of the cardiovascular system which
transports oxygenated blood away from the heart through the aorta from the left
ventricle where the blood has been previously deposited from pulmonary
circulation, to the rest of the body, and returns oxygen-depleted blood back to
the heart.[8]
*** Brain ***
Main article: Cerebral_circulation
The brain has a dual blood supply that comes from arteries at its front and
back. These are called the "anterior" and "posterior" circulation respectively.
The anterior circulation arises from the internal_carotid_arteries and supplies
the front of the brain. The posterior circulation arises from the vertebral
arteries, and supplies the back of the brain and brainstem. The circulation
from the front and the back join together (anastomise) at the Circle_of_Willis.
*** Kidneys ***
The renal_circulation receives around 20% of the cardiac output. It branches
from the abdominal_aorta and returns blood to the ascending vena_cava. It is
the blood supply to the kidneys, and contains many specialized blood vessels.
**** Lymphatic system ****
Main article: Lymphatic_system
The lymphatic_system is part of the circulatory system. It is a network of
lymphatic_vessels and lymph_capillaries, lymph_nodes and organs, and lymphatic
tissues and circulating lymph. One of its major functions is to carry the
lymph, draining and returning interstitial_fluid back towards the heart for
return to the cardiovascular system, by emptying into the lymphatic_ducts. Its
other main function is in the adaptive_immune_system.[11]
***** Development *****
Main article: Fetal_circulation
The development of the circulatory system starts with vasculogenesis in the
embryo. The human arterial and venous systems develop from different areas in
the embryo. The arterial system develops mainly from the aortic_arches, six
pairs of arches which develop on the upper part of the embryo. The venous
system arises from three bilateral veins during weeks 4 â 8 of embryogenesis.
Fetal_circulation begins within the 8th week of development. Fetal circulation
does not include the lungs, which are bypassed via the truncus_arteriosus.
Before birth the fetus obtains oxygen (and nutrients) from the mother through
the placenta and the umbilical_cord.[12]
**** Heart ****
Main article: Heart_development
**** Arteries ****
Main article: Aortic_arches
The human arterial system originates from the aortic arches and from the dorsal
aortae starting from week 4 of embryonic life. The first and second aortic
arches regress and forms only the maxillary_arteries and stapedial_arteries
respectively. The arterial system itself arises from aortic arches 3, 4 and 6
(aortic arch 5 completely regresses).
The dorsal aortae, present on the dorsal side of the embryo, are initially
present on both sides of the embryo. They later fuse to form the basis for the
aorta itself. Approximately thirty smaller arteries branch from this at the
back and sides. These branches form the intercostal_arteries, arteries of the
arms and legs, lumbar arteries and the lateral sacral arteries. Branches to the
sides of the aorta will form the definitive renal, suprarenal and gonadal
arteries. Finally, branches at the front of the aorta consist of the vitelline
arteries and umbilical_arteries. The vitelline arteries form the celiac,
superior and inferior_mesenteric_arteries of the gastrointestinal tract. After
birth, the umbilical arteries will form the internal_iliac_arteries.
**** Veins ****
The human venous system develops mainly from the vitelline_veins, the umbilical
veins and the cardinal_veins, all of which empty into the sinus_venosus.
***** Function *****
**** Cardiovascular system ****
Animation of a typical human red blood cell cycle in the circulatory system.
This animation occurs at a faster rate (~20 seconds of the average 60-second
cycle) and shows the red blood cell deforming as it enters capillaries, as well
as the bars changing color as the cell alternates in states of oxygenation
along the circulatory system.
Main article: Blood_Â§ Oxygen_transport
About 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human,
breathing air at sea-level pressure, is chemically combined with hemoglobin
molecules. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and
not connected to hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter
of oxygen in mammals and many other species.
**** Lymphatic system ****
Main article: Lymphatic_system_Â§ Function
***** Clinical significance *****
Many diseases affect the circulatory system. These include a number of
cardiovascular_diseases, affecting the cardiovascular system, and lymphatic
diseases affecting the lymphatic system. Cardiologists are medical
professionals which specialise in the heart, and cardiothoracic_surgeons
specialise in operating on the heart and its surrounding areas. Vascular
surgeons focus on other parts of the circulatory system.
**** Cardiovascular disease ****
Main article: Cardiovascular_disease
Diseases affecting the cardiovascular system are called cardiovascular_disease.
Many of these diseases are called "lifestyle_diseases" because they develop
over time and are related to a person's exercise habits, diet, whether they
smoke, and other lifestyle choices a person makes. Atherosclerosis is the
precursor to many of these diseases. It is where small atheromatous_plaques
build up in the walls of medium and large arteries. This may eventually grow or
rupture to occlude the arteries. It is also a risk factor for acute_coronary
syndromes, which are diseases which are characterised by a sudden deficit of
oxygenated blood to the heart tissue. Atherosclerosis is also associated with
problems such as aneurysm formation or splitting ("dissection") of arteries.
Another major cardiovascular disease involves the creation of a clot,_called_a
"thrombus". These can originate in veins or arteries. Deep_venous_thrombosis,
which mostly occurs in the legs, is one cause of clots in the veins of the
legs, particularly when a person has been stationary for a long time. These
clots may embolise, meaning travel to another location in the body. The results
of this may include pulmonary_embolus, transient_ischaemic_attacks, or stroke.
Cardiovascular diseases may also be congenital in nature, such as heart_defects
or persistent_fetal_circulation, where the circulatory changes that are
supposed to happen after birth do not. Not all congenital changes to the
circulatory system are associated with diseases, a large number are anatomical
variations.
**** Investigations ****
Magnetic_resonance_angiography of aberrant_subclavian_artery
The function and health of the circulatory system and its parts are measured in
a variety of manual and automated ways. These include simple methods such as
those that are part of the cardiovascular_examination, including the taking of
a person's pulse as an indicator of a person's heart_rate, the taking of blood
pressure through a sphygmomanometer or the use of a stethoscope to listen to
the heart for murmurs which may indicate problems with the heart's_valves. An
electrocardiogram can also be used to evaluate the way in which electricity is
conducted through the heart.
Other more invasive means can also be used. A cannula or catheter inserted into
an artery may be used to measure pulse_pressure or pulmonary_wedge_pressures.
Angiography, which involves injecting a dye into an artery to visualise an
arterial tree, can be used in the heart (coronary_angiography) or brain. At the
same time as the arteries are visualised, blockages or narrowings may be fixed
through the insertion of stents, and active bleeds may be managed by the
insertion of coils. An MRI may be used to image arteries, called an MRI
angiogram. For evaluation of the blood supply to the lungs a CT_pulmonary
angiogram may be used.
Vascular_ultrasonography include for example:
    * Intravascular_ultrasound
    * Ultrasonography_of_deep_venous_thrombosis
    * Ultrasonography_of_chronic_venous_insufficiency_of_the_legs
**** Surgery ****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (March
         2015)
There are a number of surgical procedures performed on the circulatory system:
    * Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery
    * Coronary_stent used in angioplasty
    * Vascular_surgery
    * Vein_stripping
    * Cosmetic procedures
Cardiovascular procedures are more likely to be performed in an inpatient
setting than in an ambulatory care setting; in the United States, only 28% of
cardiovascular surgeries were performed in the ambulatory care setting.[13]
***** Society and culture *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (March
         2015)
In Ancient Greece, the heart was thought to be the source of innate heat for
the body. The circulatory system as we know it was discovered by William_Harvey
***** Other animals *****
While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed cardiovascular system
(meaning that the blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and
capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open cardiovascular system. The
lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system providing an accessory
route for excess interstitial fluid to be returned to the blood.[5] The more
primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack circulatory systems.
The blood vascular system first appeared probably in an ancestor of the
triploblasts over 600 million years ago, overcoming the time-distance
constraints of diffusion, while endothelium evolved in an ancestral vertebrate
some 540â510 million years ago.[14]
**** Open circulatory system ****
See also: Hemolymph
The open circulatory system of the grasshopper â made up of a heart, vessels
and hemolymph. The hemolymph is pumped through the heart, into the aorta,
dispersed into the head and throughout the hemocoel, then back through the
ostia in the heart and the process repeated.
In arthropods, the open circulatory system is a system in which a fluid in a
cavity called the hemocoel bathes the organs directly with oxygen and nutrients
and there is no distinction between blood and interstitial_fluid; this combined
fluid is called hemolymph or haemolymph.[15] Muscular movements by the animal
during locomotion can facilitate hemolymph movement, but diverting flow from
one area to another is limited. When the heart relaxes, blood is drawn back
toward the heart through open-ended pores (ostia).
Hemolymph fills all of the interior hemocoel of the body and surrounds all
cells. Hemolymph is composed of water, inorganic salts (mostly sodium,
chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium), and organic_compounds (mostly
carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). The primary oxygen transporter molecule
is hemocyanin.
There are free-floating cells, the hemocytes, within the hemolymph. They play a
role in the arthropod immune_system.
Flatworms, such as this Pseudoceros_bifurcus, lack specialized circulatory
organs
**** Closed circulatory system ****
Two-chambered heart of a fish
The circulatory systems of all vertebrates, as well as of annelids (for
example, earthworms) and cephalopods (squids, octopuses and relatives) are
closed, just as in humans. Still, the systems of fish, amphibians, reptiles,
and birds show various stages of the evolution of the circulatory system.[16]
In fish, the system has only one circuit, with the blood being pumped through
the capillaries of the gills and on to the capillaries of the body tissues.
This is known as single cycle circulation. The heart of fish is, therefore,
only a single pump (consisting of two chambers).
In amphibians and most reptiles, a double circulatory system is used, but the
heart is not always completely separated into two pumps. Amphibians have a
three-chambered heart.
In reptiles, the ventricular_septum of the heart is incomplete and the
pulmonary_artery is equipped with a sphincter_muscle. This allows a second
possible route of blood flow. Instead of blood flowing through the pulmonary
artery to the lungs, the sphincter may be contracted to divert this blood flow
through the incomplete ventricular septum into the left_ventricle and out
through the aorta. This means the blood flows from the capillaries to the heart
and back to the capillaries instead of to the lungs. This process is useful to
ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals in the regulation of their body temperature.
Birds, mammals, and crocodilians show complete separation of the heart into two
pumps, for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-
chambered heart of birds and crocodilians evolved independently from that of
mammals.[17]
**** No circulatory system ****
Circulatory systems are absent in some animals, including flatworms. Their body
cavity has no lining or enclosed fluid. Instead a muscular pharynx leads to an
extensively branched digestive_system that facilitates direct diffusion of
nutrients to all cells. The flatworm's dorso-ventrally flattened body shape
also restricts the distance of any cell from the digestive system or the
exterior of the organism. Oxygen can diffuse from the surrounding water into
the cells, and carbon_dioxide can diffuse out. Consequently, every cell is able
to obtain nutrients, water and oxygen without the need of a transport system.
Some animals, such as jellyfish, have more extensive branching from their
gastrovascular_cavity (which functions as both a place of digestion and a form
of circulation), this branching allows for bodily fluids to reach the outer
layers, since the digestion begins in the inner layers.

included. Other organs are numbered and arranged around it. Before cutting out
the figures on this page, Vesalius suggests that readers glue the page onto
parchment and gives instructions on how to assemble the pieces and paste the
multilayered figure onto a base "muscle man" illustration. "Epitome", fol.14a.
HMD Collection, WZ 240 V575dhZ 1543.
The earliest known writings on the circulatory system are found in the Ebers
Papyrus (16th century BCE), an ancient_Egyptian_medical_papyrus containing over
700 prescriptions and remedies, both physical and spiritual. In the papyrus, it
acknowledges the connection of the heart to the arteries. The Egyptians thought
air came in through the mouth and into the lungs and heart. From the heart, the
air travelled to every member through the arteries. Although this concept of
the circulatory system is only partially correct, it represents one of the
earliest accounts of scientific thought.
In the 6th century BCE, the knowledge of circulation of vital fluids through
the body was known to the Ayurvedic physician Sushruta in ancient_India.[18] He
also seems to have possessed knowledge of the arteries, described as 'channels'
by Dwivedi & Dwivedi (2007).[18] The valves_of_the_heart were discovered by a
physician of the Hippocratean school around the 4th century BCE. However their
function was not properly understood then. Because blood pools in the veins
after death, arteries look empty. Ancient anatomists assumed they were filled
with air and that they were for transport of air.
The Greek_physician, Herophilus, distinguished veins from arteries but thought
that the pulse was a property of arteries themselves. Greek anatomist
Erasistratus observed that arteries that were cut during life bleed. He
ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is
replaced with blood that entered by very small vessels between veins and
arteries. Thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow of
blood.[19]
In 2nd century AD Rome, the Greek physician Galen knew that blood vessels
carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and
thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Growth and energy
were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial
blood gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart.
Blood flowed from both creating organs to all parts of the body where it was
consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver. The heart did
not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and
the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves.
Galen believed that the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from
the left ventricle to the right by passing through 'pores' in the
interventricular septum, air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to
the left side of the heart. As the arterial blood was created 'sooty' vapors
were created and passed to the lungs also via the pulmonary artery to be
exhaled.
In 1025, The_Canon_of_Medicine by the Persian_physician, Avicenna, "erroneously
accepted the Greek notion regarding the existence of a hole in the ventricular
septum by which the blood traveled between the ventricles." Despite this,
Avicenna "correctly wrote on the cardiac_cycles and valvular function", and
"had a vision of blood circulation" in his Treatise on Pulse.[20][verification
needed] While also refining Galen's erroneous theory of the pulse, Avicenna
provided the first correct explanation of pulsation: "Every beat of the pulse
comprises two movements and two pauses. Thus, expansion : pause : contraction :
pause. [...] The pulse is a movement in the heart and arteries ... which takes
the form of alternate expansion and contraction."[21]
In 1242, the Arabian_physician, Ibn_al-Nafis, became the first person to
accurately describe the process of pulmonary_circulation, for which he is
sometimes considered the father of circulatory_physiology.[22][failed
verification] Ibn al-Nafis stated in his Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's
Canon:
     "...the blood from the right chamber of the heart must arrive at the
     left chamber but there is no direct pathway between them. The thick
     septum of the heart is not perforated and does not have visible pores
     as some people thought or invisible pores as Galen thought. The blood
     from the right chamber must flow through the vena arteriosa
     (pulmonary_artery) to the lungs, spread through its substances, be
     mingled there with air, pass through the arteria venosa (pulmonary
     vein) to reach the left chamber of the heart and there form the vital
     spirit..."
In addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what would become a larger theory
of the capillary circulation. He stated that "there must be small
communications or pores (manafidh in Arabic) between the pulmonary artery and
vein," a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more
than 400 years.[23] Ibn al-Nafis' theory, however, was confined to blood
transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body.
Michael_Servetus was the first European to describe the function of pulmonary
circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time,
for a few reasons. He firstly described it in the "Manuscript of Paris"[24][25]
(near 1546), but this work was never published. And later he published this
description, but in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a
book on medicine. Only three copies of the book survived but these remained
hidden for decades, the rest were burned shortly after its publication in 1553
because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities.
Better known discovery of pulmonary circulation was by Vesalius's successor at
Padua, Realdo_Colombo, in 1559.
Image of veins from William_Harvey's Exercitatio_Anatomica_de_Motu_Cordis_et
Sanguinis_in_Animalibus, 1628
Finally, the English physician William_Harvey, a pupil of Hieronymus_Fabricius
(who had earlier described the valves of the veins without recognizing their
function), performed a sequence of experiments, and published his Exercitatio
Anatomica_de_Motu_Cordis_et_Sanguinis_in_Animalibus in 1628, which
"demonstrated that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and
arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most importantly,
he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood
through minute connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual
leap that was quite different from Ibn al-Nafis' refinement of the anatomy and
bloodflow in the heart and lungs."[26] This work, with its essentially correct
exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey was not able to
identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; these were later
discovered by Marcello_Malpighi in 1661.
In 1956, AndrÃ©_FrÃ©dÃ©ric_Cournand, Werner_Forssmann and Dickinson_W._Richards
were awarded the Nobel_Prize in Medicine "for their discoveries concerning
heart_catheterization and pathological changes in the circulatory system."[27]
In his Nobel lecture, Forssmann credits Harvey as birthing cardiology with the
publication of his book in 1628.[28]
In the 1970s, Diana_McSherry developed computer-based systems to create images
of the circulatory system and heart without the need for surgery.[29]
