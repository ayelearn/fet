Life cycle of the black rot pathogen, Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campes
Plant pathology (also phytopathology) is the scientific study of diseases in
plants caused by pathogens (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions
(physiological factors).[1] Organisms that cause infectious disease include
fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, viroids, virus-like organisms,
phytoplasmas, protozoa, nematodes and parasitic_plants. Not included are
ectoparasites like insects, mites, vertebrate, or other pests_that_affect_plant
health by eating of plant tissues. Plant pathology also involves the study of
pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact,
plant_disease_epidemiology, plant_disease_resistance, how plant diseases affect
humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases.

***** Overview[edit] *****
See also: Morphological_symptoms_of_plant_diseases
Control of plant diseases is crucial to the reliable production of food, and it
provides significant problems in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and
other inputs. Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent
disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant
disease impacts such as Irish_potato_famine and chestnut_blight, as well as
recurrent severe plant diseases like rice_blast, soybean_cyst_nematode, and
citrus_canker. However, disease control is reasonably successful for most
crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for
good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as
crop_rotation, use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant
density, control of field moisture, and pesticide use. Across large regions and
many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields
by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often
exceeds 20% in less developed settings. Continuing advances in the science of
plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, and to keep up with
changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of
plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices. Plant diseases cause
major economic losses for farmers worldwide. The Food_and_Agriculture
Organization estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about
25% of crop loss. To solve this issue, new methods are needed to detect
diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and
spectroscopy and biophotonics that are able to diagnose plant health and
metabolism.[2]
***** Plant pathogens[edit] *****

Powdery_mildew, a biotrophic fungus
**** Fungi[edit] ****
Most phytopathogenic fungi belong to the Ascomycetes and the Basidiomycetes.
The fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually via the production of spores
and other structures. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or
they may be soilborne. Many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living
saprotrophically, carrying out the part of their life cycle in the soil. These
are facultative saprotrophs. Fungal diseases may be controlled through the use
of fungicides and other agriculture practices. However, new races of fungi
often evolve that are resistant to various fungicides. Biotrophic fungal
pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host
cells. Necrotrophic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract
nutrients from the dead host cells. Significant fungal plant pathogens include:
[citation_needed]
Rice_blast, caused by a necrotrophic fungus
*** Ascomycetes[edit] ***
    * Fusarium spp. (Fusarium wilt disease)
    * Thielaviopsis spp. (canker rot, black root rot, Thielaviopsis root rot)
    * Verticillium spp.
    * Magnaporthe_grisea (rice blast)
    * Sclerotinia_sclerotiorum (cottony rot)
*** Basidiomycetes[edit] ***
    * Ustilago spp. (smuts) smut of barley
    * Rhizoctonia spp.
    * Phakospora_pachyrhizi (soybean rust)
    * Puccinia spp. (severe rusts of cereals and grasses)
    * Armillaria spp. (honey fungus species, virulent pathogens of trees)
**** Fungus-like organisms[edit] ****
*** Oomycetes[edit] ***
The oomycetes are fungus-like organisms.[3] They include some of the most
destructive plant pathogens including the genus Phytophthora, which includes
the causal agents of potato_late_blight[3] and sudden_oak_death.[4][5]
Particular species of oomycetes are responsible for root_rot.
Despite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomycetes have developed
similar infection strategies. Oomycetes are capable of using effector proteins
to turn off a plant's defenses in its infection process.[6] Plant pathologists
commonly group them with fungal pathogens.
Significant oomycete plant pathogens include:
    * Pythium spp.
    * Phytophthora spp., including the potato blight of the Great_Irish_Famine
      (1845â1849)
*** Phytomyxea[edit] ***
Some slime_molds in Phytomyxea cause important diseases, including club_root in
cabbage and its relatives and powdery_scab in potatoes. These are caused by
species of Plasmodiophora and Spongospora, respectively.
**** Bacteria[edit] ****
Crown gall disease caused by Agrobacterium
Most bacteria that are associated with plants are actually saprotrophic and do
no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species,
are able to cause disease.[7] Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in
subtropical and tropical regions of the world.
Most plant pathogenic bacteria are rod-shaped (bacilli). In order to be able to
colonize the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors. Five main types of
bacterial pathogenicity factors are known: uses of cell wallâdegrading
enzymes, toxins, effector proteins, phytohormones and exopolysaccharides.
Pathogens such as Erwinia species use cell wallâdegrading enzymes to cause
soft_rot. Agrobacterium species change the level of auxins to cause tumours
with phytohormones. Exopolysaccharides are produced by bacteria and block xylem
vessels, often leading to the death of the plant.
Bacteria control the production of pathogenicity_factors via quorum_sensing.
Vitis_vinifera with "Ca. Phytoplasma vitis" infection
Significant bacterial plant pathogens:
    * Burkholderia[8]
    * Proteobacteria
          o Xanthomonas spp.
          o Pseudomonas spp.
    * Pseudomonas_syringae_pv._tomato causes tomato plants to produce less
      fruit, and it "continues to adapt to the tomato by minimizing its
      recognition by the tomato immune system."[9]
*** Phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas[edit] ***
Main article: phytoplasma
Phytoplasma and Spiroplasma are genera of bacteria that lack cell walls and are
related to the mycoplasmas, which are human pathogens. Together they are
referred to as the mollicutes. They also tend to have smaller genomes than most
other bacteria. They are normally transmitted by sap-sucking insects, being
transferred into the plant's phloem where it reproduces.
Tobacco_mosaic_virus
**** Viruses, viroids and virus-like organisms[edit] ****
Main article: Plant_Virus
There are many types of plant_virus, and some are even asymptomatic. Under
normal circumstances, plant viruses cause only a loss of crop_yield. Therefore,
it is not economically viable to try to control them, the exception being when
they infect perennial species, such as fruit trees.
Most plant viruses have small, single-stranded RNA genomes. However some plant
viruses also have double stranded RNA or single or double stranded DNA genomes.
These genomes may encode only three or four proteins: a replicase, a coat
protein, a movement_protein, in order to allow cell to cell movement through
plasmodesmata, and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector.
Plant viruses can have several more proteins and employ many different
molecular translation methods.
Plant viruses are generally transmitted from plant to plant by a vector, but
mechanical and seed transmission also occur. Vector transmission is often by an
insect (for example, aphids), but some fungi, nematodes, and protozoa have been
shown to be viral vectors. In many cases, the insect and virus are specific for
virus transmission such as the beet_leafhopper that transmits the curly_top
virus causing disease in several crop plants.[10]
**** Nematodes[edit] ****
Main article: Nematodes
Root-knot_nematode galls
Nematodes are small, multicellular wormlike animals. Many live freely in the
soil, but there are some species that parasitize plant roots. They are a
problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where they may infect
crops. Potato cyst nematodes (Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis) are
widely distributed in Europe and North and South America and cause $300 million
worth of damage in Europe every year. Root knot nematodes have quite a large
host range, they parasitize plant root systems and thus directly affect the
uptake of water and nutrients needed for normal plant growth and reproduction,
[11] whereas cyst nematodes tend to be able to infect only a few species.
Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to
facilitate their lifestyle.
**** Protozoa and algae[edit] ****
There are a few examples of plant diseases caused by protozoa (e.g.,
Phytomonas, a kinetoplastid).[12] They are transmitted as durable zoospores
that may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years.
Further, they can transmit plant viruses. When the motile zoospores come into
contact with a root_hair they produce a plasmodium which invades the roots.
Some colourless parasitic algae (e.g., Cephaleuros) also cause plant diseases.
[citation_needed]
**** Parasitic plants[edit] ****
Parasitic plants such as mistletoe and dodder are included in the study of
phytopathology. Dodder, for example, is used as a conduit either for the
transmission of viruses or virus-like agents from a host plant to a plant that
is not typically a host or for an agent that is not graft-transmissible.
***** Common pathogenic infection methods[edit] *****
    * Cell wall-degrading enzymes: These are used to break down the plant cell
      wall in order to release the nutrients inside.
    * Toxins: These can be non-host-specific, which damage all plants, or host-
      specific, which cause damage only on a host plant.
    * Effector proteins: These can be secreted into the extracellular
      environment or directly into the host cell, often via the Type_three
      secretion_system. Some effectors are known to suppress host defense
      processes. This can include: reducing the plants internal signaling
      mechanisms or reduction of phytochemicals production.[13] Bacteria,
      fungus and oomycetes are known for this function.[3][14]
Spores: Spores of phytopathogenic fungi can be a source of infection on host
plants. Spores first adhere to the cuticular layer on leaves and stems of host
plant. In order for this to happen the infectious spore must be transported
from the pathogen source, this occurs via wind, water, and vectors such as
insects and humans. When favourable conditions are present, the spore will
produce a modified hyphae called a germ tube. This germ tube later forms a
bulge called an appressorium, which forms melanized cell walls to build up
tugour pressure. Once enough turgor pressure is accumulated the appressorium
asserts pressure against the cuticular layer in the form of a hardened
penetration peg. This process is also aided by the secretion of cell wall
degrading enzymes from the appressorium. Once the penetration peg enters the
host tissue it develops a specialized hyphae called a haustorium. Based on the
pathogens life cycle, this haustorium can invade and feed neighbouring cells
intracellularly or exist intercellulary within a host.[15]
***** Physiological plant disorders[edit] *****
Main article: Physiological_plant_disorders
Abiotic disorders can be caused by natural processes such as drought, frost,
snow and hail; flooding and poor drainage; nutrient_deficiency; deposition of
mineral salts such as sodium_chloride and gypsum; windburn and breakage by
storms; and wildfires. Similar disorders (usually classed as abiotic) can be
caused by human intervention, resulting in soil compaction, pollution of air
and soil, salinisation_caused_by_irrigation and road salting, over-application
of herbicides, clumsy handling (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees), and vandalism.

***** Epidemiology[edit] *****
Main article: Plant_disease_epidemiology
Epidemiology: The study of factors affecting the outbreak and spread of
infectious diseases.[16]
Plant disease triangle
A disease tetrahedron (disease pyramid) best captures the elements involved
with plant diseases. This pyramid uses the disease triangle as a foundation,
consisting of elements such as: host, pathogen and environment. In addition to
these three elements, humans and time add the remaining elements to create a
disease tetrahedron.
History: Plant disease epidemics that are historically known based on
tremendous losses:
- Irish potato late blight[17]
- Dutch elm disease [18]
- Chestnut blight in North America[19]
Factors affecting epidemics:
Host: Resistance or susceptibility level, age and genetics.
Pathogen: Amount of innoculum, genetics, and type of reproduction

***** Disease resistance[edit] *****
Main article: Plant_disease_resistance
Plant disease resistance is the ability of a plant to prevent and terminate
infections from plant pathogens.
Structures that help plants prevent disease are: cuticular layer, cell walls
and stomata guard cells. These act as a barrier to prevent pathogens from
entering the plant host.
Once diseases have over come these barriers, plant receptors initiate
signalling pathways to create molecules to compete against the foreign
molecules. These pathways are influenced and triggered by genes within the host
plant and are susceptible to being manipulated by genetic breeding to create
varieties of plants that are resistant to destructive pathogens.[20]

***** Management[edit] *****
Further information: Pest_control and Antagonism_(phytopathology)
  Quarantine
      A diseased patch of vegetation or individual plants can be isolated from
      other, healthy growth. Specimens may be destroyed or relocated into a
      greenhouse for treatment or study. Another option is to avoid the
      introduction of harmful nonnative organisms by controlling all human
      traffic and activity (e.g., AQIS), although legislation and enforcement
      are crucial in order to ensure lasting effectiveness.
  Cultural
      Farming in some societies is kept on a small scale, tended by peoples
      whose culture includes farming traditions going back to ancient times.
      (An example of such traditions would be lifelong training in techniques
      of plot terracing, weather anticipation and response, fertilization,
      grafting, seed care, and dedicated gardening.) Plants that are intently
      monitored often benefit from not only active external protection but also
      a greater overall vigor. While primitive in the sense of being the most
      labor-intensive solution by far, where practical or necessary it is more
      than adequate.
  Plant resistance
      Sophisticated agricultural developments now allow growers to choose from
      among systematically cross-bred species to ensure the greatest hardiness
      in their crops, as suited for a particular region's pathological profile.
      Breeding practices have been perfected over centuries, but with the
      advent of genetic manipulation even finer control of a crop's immunity
      traits is possible. The engineering of food plants may be less rewarding,
      however, as higher output is frequently offset by popular suspicion and
      negative opinion about this "tampering" with nature.
  Chemical
      (See: pesticide_application) Many natural and synthetic compounds can be
      employed to combat the above threats. This method works by directly
      eliminating disease-causing organisms or curbing their spread; however,
      it has been shown to have too broad an effect, typically, to be good for
      the local ecosystem. From an economic standpoint, all but the simplest
      natural additives may disqualify a product from "organic" status,
      potentially reducing the value of the yield.
  Biological
      Crop_rotation may be an effective means to prevent a parasitic population
      from becoming well-established, as an organism affecting leaves would be
      starved when the leafy crop is replaced by a tuberous type, etc. Other
      means to undermine parasites without attacking them directly may exist.
  Integrated
      The use of two or more of these methods in combination offers a higher
      chance of effectiveness.
***** History[edit] *****
