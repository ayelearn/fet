Heterosis, hybrid vigor, or outbreeding enhancement, is the improved or
increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. An
offspring is heterotic if its traits are enhanced as a result of mixing the
genetic contributions of its parents. These effects can be due to Mendelian or
non-Mendelian_inheritance.

***** Definitions[edit] *****
In proposing the term heterosis to replace the older term heterozygosis, G.H.
Shull aimed to avoid limiting the term to the effects that can be explained by
heterozygosity in Mendelian inheritance.[1]
     The physiological vigor of an organism as manifested in its rapidity
     of growth, its height and general robustness, is positively
     correlated with the degree of dissimilarity in the gametes by whose
     union the organism was formed â¦ The more numerous the differences
     between the uniting gametes â at least within certain limits â
     the greater on the whole is the amount of stimulation â¦ These
     differences need not be Mendelian in their inheritance â¦ To avoid
     the implication that all the genotypic differences which stimulate
     cell-division, growth and other physiological activities of an
     organism are Mendelian in their inheritance and also to gain brevity
     of expression I suggest â¦ that the word 'heterosis' be adopted.
Heterosis is often discussed as the opposite of inbreeding_depression although
differences in these two concepts can be seen in evolutionary considerations
such as the role of genetic_variation or the effects of genetic_drift in small
populations on these concepts. Inbreeding depression occurs when related
parents have children with traits that negatively influence their fitness
largely due to homozygosity. In such instances, outcrossing should result in
heterosis.
Not all outcrosses result in heterosis. For example, when a hybrid inherits
traits from its parents that are not fully compatible, fitness can be reduced.
This is a form of outbreeding_depression.
***** Dominance versus overdominance[edit] *****
Dominance versus overdominance is a scientific_controversy in the field of
genetics that has persisted for more than a century.[2] These two alternative
hypotheses were first stated in 1908.
***** Genetic basis[edit] *****
When a population is small or inbred, it tends to lose genetic diversity.
Inbreeding_depression is the loss of fitness due to loss of genetic diversity.
Inbred strains tend to be homozygous for recessive alleles that are mildly
harmful (or produce a trait that is undesirable from the standpoint of the
breeder). Heterosis or hybrid vigor, on the other hand, is the tendency of
outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness.
Selective breeding of plants and animals, including hybridization, began long
before there was an understanding of underlying scientific principles. In the
early 20th century, after Mendel's_laws came to be understood and accepted,
geneticists undertook to explain the superior vigor of many plant hybrids. Two
competing hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, were developed:[3]
Genetic basis of heterosis. Dominance hypothesis. Scenario A. Fewer genes are
under-expressed in the homozygous individual. Gene expression in the offspring
is equal to the expression of the fittest parent. Overdominance hypothesis.
Scenario B. Over-expression of certain genes in the heterozygous offspring.
(The size of the circle depicts the expression level of gene A)
    * Dominance hypothesis. The dominance hypothesis attributes the superiority
      of hybrids to the suppression of undesirable recessive alleles from one
      parent by dominant alleles from the other. It attributes the poor
      performance of inbred strains to loss of genetic diversity, with the
      strains becoming purely homozygous at many loci. The dominance hypothesis
      was first expressed in 1908 by the geneticist Charles_Davenport.[4] Under
      the dominance hypothesis, deleterious alleles are expected to be
      maintained in a random-mating population at a selectionâmutation
      balance that would depend on the rate of mutation, the effect of the
      alleles and the degree to which alleles are expressed in heterozygotes.
      [5]
    * Overdominance hypothesis. Certain combinations of alleles that can be
      obtained by crossing two inbred strains are advantageous_in_the
      heterozygote. The overdominance hypothesis attributes the heterozygote
      advantage to the survival of many alleles that are recessive and harmful
      in homozygotes. It attributes the poor performance of inbred strains to a
      high percentage of these harmful recessives. The overdominance hypothesis
      was developed independently by Edward_M._East (1908)[6] and George_Shull
      (1908).[7] Genetic variation at an overdominant locus is expected to be
      maintained by balancing selection. The high fitness of heterozygous
      genotypes favours the persistence of an allelic polymorphism in the
      population.[5]
Dominance and overdominance have different consequences for the gene_expression
profile of the individuals. If overdominance is the main cause for the fitness
advantages of heterosis, then there should be an over-expression of certain
genes in the heterozygous offspring compared to the homozygous parents. On the
other hand, if dominance is the cause, fewer genes should be under-expressed in
the heterozygous offspring compared to the parents. Furthermore, for any given
gene, the expression should be comparable to the one observed in the fitter of
the two parents.
***** Historical retrospective[edit] *****
Population geneticist James_Crow (1916-2012) believed, in his younger days,
that overdominance was a major contributor to hybrid vigor. In 1998 he
published a retrospective review of the developing science.[8] According to
Crow, the demonstration of several cases of heterozygote_advantage in
Drosophila and other organisms first caused great enthusiasm for the
overdominance theory among scientists studying plant hybridization. But
overdominance implies that yields on an inbred strain should decrease as inbred
strains are selected for the performance of their hybrid crosses, as the
proportion of harmful recessives in the inbred population rises. Over the
years, experimentation in plant genetics has proven that the reverse occurs,
that yields increase in both the inbred strains and the hybrids, suggesting
that dominance alone may be adequate to explain the superior yield of hybrids.
Only a few conclusive cases of overdominance have been reported in all of
genetics. Since the 1980s, as experimental evidence has mounted, the dominance
theory has made a comeback.
Crow writes:
     "The current view ... is that the dominance hypothesis is the major
     explanation of inbreeding decline and [of] the high yield of hybrids.
     There is little statistical evidence for contributions from
     overdominance and epistasis. But whether the best hybrids are getting
     an extra boost from overdominance or favorable epistatic
     contributions remains an open question."[8]
***** Controversy[edit] *****
The term heterosis often causes confusion and even controversy, particularly in
selective breeding of domestic_animals, because it is sometimes (incorrectly)
claimed that all crossbred plants and animals are "genetically superior" to
their parents, due to heterosis[citation_needed]. However, there are two
problems with this claim:
    * First, according to an article published in the journal Genome_Biology,
      "genetic_superiority" is an ill-defined term and not generally accepted
      terminology within the scientific field of genetics.[9] A related term
      fitness is well defined, but it can rarely be directly measured. Instead,
      scientists use objective, measurable quantities, such as the number of
      seeds a plant produces, the germination rate of a seed, or the percentage
      of organisms that survive to reproductive age.[10] From this perspective,
      crossbred plants and animals exhibiting heterosis may have "superior"
      traits, but this does not necessarily equate to any evidence of outright
      "genetic superiority". Use of the term "superiority" is commonplace for
      example in crop breeding, where it is well understood to mean a better-
      yielding, more robust plant for agriculture. Such a plant may yield
      better on a farm, but would likely struggle to survive in the wild,
      making this use open to misinterpretation. In human genetics any question
      of "genetic superiority" is even more problematic due to the historical
      and political implications of any such claim. Some may even go as far as
      to describe it as a questionable value judgement in the realm of
      politics, not science.[9]
    * Second, not all hybrids exhibit heterosis (see outbreeding_depression).
An example of the ambiguous value judgements imposed on hybrids and hybrid
vigor is the mule. While mules are almost always infertile, they are valued for
a combination of hardiness and temperament that is different from either of
their horse or donkey parents. While these qualities may make them "superior"
for particular uses by humans, the infertility issue implies that these animals
would most likely become extinct without the intervention of humans through
animal_husbandry, making them "inferior" in terms of natural_selection.
***** Genetic and epigenetic bases[edit] *****
Main articles: Heterozygote_advantage, Histone_H3, and microRNA
Since the early 1900s, two competing genetic hypotheses, not necessarily
mutually exclusive, have been developed to explain hybrid vigor. More recently,
an epigenetic component of hybrid vigor has also been established.[11][12]
The genetic dominance hypothesis attributes the superiority of hybrids to the
masking of expression of undesirable (deleterious) recessive alleles from one
parent by dominant (usually wild-type) alleles from the other (see
Complementation_(genetics)). It attributes the poor performance of inbred
strains to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles. The
genetic overdominance hypothesis states that some combinations of alleles
(which can be obtained by crossing two inbred strains) are especially
advantageous_when_paired_in_a_heterozygous_individual. This hypothesis is
commonly invoked to explain the persistence of some alleles (most famously the
Sickle_cell_trait allele) that are harmful in homozygotes. In normal
circumstances, such harmful alleles would be removed from a population through
the process of natural selection. Like the dominance hypothesis, it attributes
the poor performance of inbred strains to expression of such harmful recessive
alleles. In any case, outcross matings provide the benefit of masking
deleterious recessive alleles in progeny. This benefit has been proposed to be
a major factor in the maintenance of sexual reproduction among eukaryotes, as
summarized in the article Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction.
An epigenetic contribution to heterosis has been established in plants,[12] and
it has also been reported in animals.[13] MicroRNAs (miRNAs), discovered in
1993, are a class of non-coding small RNAs which repress the translation of
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or cause degradation of mRNAs.[14] In hybrid plants,
most miRNAs have non-additive expression (it might be higher or lower than the
levels in the parents).[12] This suggests that the small RNAs are involved in
the growth, vigor and adaptation of hybrids.[12]
'Heterosis without hybridity' effects on plant size have been demonstrated in
genetically isogenic F1 triploid (autopolyploid) plants, where paternal genome
excess F1 triploids display positive heterosis, whereas maternal genome excess
F1s display negative heterosis effects.[15] Such findings demonstrate that
heterosis effects, with a genome dosage-dependent epigenetic basis, can be
generated in F1 offspring that are genetically isogenic (i.e. harbour no
heterozygosity).[15][16] It has been shown[11] that hybrid vigor in an
allopolyploid hybrid of two Arabidopsis species was due to epigenetic control
in the upstream regions of two genes, which caused major downstream alteration
in chlorophyll and starch accumulation. The mechanism involves acetylation and/
or methylation of specific amino acids in histone_H3, a protein closely
associated with DNA, which can either activate or repress associated genes.
**** Major histocompatibility complex in animals[edit] ****
One example of where particular genes may be important in vertebrate animals
for heterosis is the major_histocompatibility_complex (MHC). Vertebrates
inherit several copies of both MHC_class_I and MHC_class_II from each parent,
which are used in antigen_presentation as part of the adaptive immune system.
Each different copy of the genes is able to bind and present a different set of
potential peptides to T-lymphocytes. These genes are highly polymorphic
throughout populations, but will be more similar in smaller, more closely
related populations. Breeding between more genetically distant individuals will
decrease the chance of inheriting two alleles which are the same or similar,
allowing a more diverse range of peptides to be presented. This therefore gives
a decreased chance that any particular pathogen will not be recognised, and
means that more antigenic proteins on any pathogen are likely to be recognised,
giving a greater range of T-cell activation and therefore a greater response.
This will also mean that the immunity acquired to the pathogen will be against
a greater range of antigens, meaning that the pathogen must mutate more before
immunity is lost. Thus hybrids will be less likely to be succumb to pathogenic
disease and will be more capable of fighting off infection.
***** Plants[edit] *****
Crosses between inbreds from different heterotic groups result in vigorous F1
hybrids with significantly more heterosis than F1 hybrids from inbreds within
the same heterotic group or pattern. Heterotic groups are created by plant
breeders to classify inbred lines, and can be progressively improved by
reciprocal recurrent selection.
Heterosis is used to increase yields, uniformity, and vigor. Hybrid breeding
methods are used in maize, sorghum, rice, sugar_beet, onion, spinach,
sunflowers, broccoli and to create a more psychoactive cannabis.
**** Corn (maize)[edit] ****
Nearly all field corn (maize) grown in most developed_nations exhibits
heterosis. Modern corn hybrids substantially outyield conventional cultivars
and respond better to fertilizer.
Corn heterosis was famously demonstrated in the early 20th century by George_H.
Shull and Edward_M._East after hybrid corn was invented by Dr. William_James
Beal of Michigan_State_University based on work begun in 1879 at the urging of
Charles_Darwin. Dr. Beal's work led to the first published account of a field
experiment demonstrating hybrid vigor in corn, by Eugene_Davenport and Perry
Holden, 1881. These various pioneers of botany and related fields showed that
crosses of inbred lines made from a Southern dent and a Northern flint,
respectively, showed substantial heterosis and outyielded conventional
cultivars of that era. However, at that time such hybrids could not be
economically made on a large scale for use by farmers. Donald_F._Jones at the
Connecticut Agricultural_Experiment_Station, New_Haven invented the first
practical method of producing a high-yielding hybrid maize in 1914-1917. Jones'
method produced a double-cross hybrid, which requires two crossing steps
working from four distinct original inbred lines. Later work by corn breeders
produced inbred lines with sufficient vigor for practical production of a
commercial hybrid in a single step, the single-cross hybrids. Single-cross
hybrids are made from just two original parent inbreds. They are generally more
vigorous and also more uniform than the earlier double-cross hybrids. The
process of creating these hybrids often involves detasseling.
Temperate maize hybrids are derived from two main heterotic groups: Iowa Stiff
Stalk Synthetic, and non stiff stalk.[citation_needed]
**** Rice (Oryza sativa)[edit] ****
Rice production has seen enormous rise in China due to heavy uses of hybrid
rice. In China, efforts have generated a super hybrid rice strain (LYP9) with a
production capability of ~15 tons per hectare. In India also, several varieties
have shown high vigor, including RH-10 and Suruchi 5401.
***** Hybrid livestock[edit] *****
The concept of heterosis is also applied in the production of commercial
livestock. In cattle, crosses between Black_Angus and Hereford produce a cross
known as a "Black_Baldy". In swine, "blue butts" are produced by the cross of
Hampshire and Yorkshire. Other, more exotic hybrids such as "beefalo" are also
used for specialty markets.
**** Poultry[edit] ****
Within poultry, sex-linked genes have been used to create hybrids in which
males and females can be sorted at one day old by color. Specific genes used
for this are genes for barring and wing feather growth. Crosses of this sort
create what are sold as Black Sex-links, Red Sex-links, and various other
crosses that are known by trade names.
Commercial broilers are produced by crossing different strains of White Rocks
and White Cornish, the Cornish providing a large frame and the Rocks providing
the fast rate of gain. The hybrid vigor produced allows the production of
uniform birds with a marketable carcass at 6â9 weeks of age.
Likewise, hybrids between different strains of White Leghorn are used to
produce laying flocks that provide the majority of white eggs for sale in the
United States.
***** Dogs[edit] *****
In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than
pure breeds.[17]
John Scott and John_L._Fuller performed a detailed study of purebred cocker
spaniels, purebred basenjis, and hybrids between them.[18] They found that
hybrids ran faster than either parent, perhaps due to heterosis. Other
characteristics, such as basal heart rate, did not show any heterosisâthe
dog's basal heart rate was close to the average of its parentsâperhaps due to
the additive effects of multiple genes.[19]
Sometimes people working on a dog breeding program find no useful heterosis.
[20]
***** Humans[edit] *****
See also: Exogamy
Human beings are all extremely genetically similar to one another.[21][22][23]
Michael Mingroni has proposed heterosis, in the form of hybrid vigor associated
with historical reductions of the levels of inbreeding, as an explanation of
the Flynn_effect, the steady rise in IQ test scores around the world during the
twentieth century. However, James_R._Flynn has pointed out that even if
everyone mated with a sibling in 1900, subsequent increases in heterosis would
not be a sufficient explanation of the observed IQ gains.[24]

      humans has resulted in a high relatedness among all living people, as
      indicated for example by the very low fixation index (FST) among living
      human populations.

      November 2013. The massive efforts to study the human genome in detail
      have produced extraordinary amounts of genetic data. Although we still
      fail to understand the molecular bases of most complex traits, including
      many common diseases, we now have a clearer idea of the degree of genetic
      resemblance between humans and other primate species. We also know that
      humans are genetically very close to each other, indeed more than any
      other primates, that most of our genetic diversity is accounted for by
      individual differences within populations, and that only a small fraction
      of the speciesâ genetic variance falls between populations and
      geographic groups thereof.

      (4 September 2010). Most studies of human population genetics begin by
      citing a seminal 1972 paper by Richard Lewontin bearing the title of this
      subsection [29]. Given the central role this work has played in our
      field, we will begin by discussing it briefly and return to its
      conclusions throughout the chapter. ... A key conclusion of the paper is
      that 85.4% of the total genetic variation observed occurred within each
      group. That is, he reported that the vast majority of genetic differences
      are found within populations rather than between them. ... His finding
      has been reproduced in study after study up through the present: two
      random individuals from any one group (which could be a continent or even
      a local population) are almost as different as any two random individuals
      from the entire world
