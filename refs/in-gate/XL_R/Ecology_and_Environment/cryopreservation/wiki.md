Tubes of biological samples being placed in liquid nitrogen.
Cryogenically preserved samples being removed from a liquid nitrogen dewar.
Cryo-preservation or cryo-conservation is a process where organelles, cells,
tissues, extracellular_matrix, organs, or any other biological constructs
susceptible to damage caused by unregulated chemical_kinetics are preserved by
cooling to very low temperatures[1] (typically â80 Â°C using solid carbon
dioxide or â196 Â°C using liquid_nitrogen). At low enough temperatures, any
enzymatic or chemical activity which might cause damage to the biological
material in question is effectively stopped. Cryopreservation methods seek to
reach low temperatures without causing additional damage caused by the
formation of ice crystals during freezing. Traditional cryopreservation has
relied on coating the material to be frozen with a class of molecules termed
cryoprotectants. New methods are constantly being investigated due to the
inherent toxicity of many cryoprotectants.[2] By default it should be
considered that cryopreservation alters or compromises the_structure_and
function_of_cells unless it is proven otherwise for a particular cell
population. Cryoconservation_of_animal_genetic_resources is the process in
which animal genetic material is collected and stored with the intention of
conservation of the breed.

***** Natural cryopreservation[edit] *****
Water-bears (Tardigrada), microscopic multicellular organisms, can survive
freezing by replacing most of their internal water with the sugar trehalose,
preventing it from crystallization that otherwise damages cell_membranes.
Mixtures of solutes can achieve similar effects. Some solutes, including salts,
have the disadvantage that they may be toxic at intense concentrations. In
addition to the water-bear, wood frogs can tolerate the freezing of their blood
and other tissues. Urea is accumulated in tissues in preparation for
overwintering, and liver glycogen is converted in large quantities to glucose
in response to internal ice formation. Both urea and glucose act as
"cryoprotectants" to limit the amount of ice that forms and to reduce osmotic
shrinkage of cells. Frogs can survive many freeze/thaw events during winter if
no more than about 65% of the total body water freezes. Research exploring the
phenomenon of "freezing frogs" has been performed primarily by the Canadian
researcher, Dr. Kenneth_B._Storey.[citation_needed]
Freeze tolerance, in which organisms survive the winter by freezing solid and
ceasing life functions, is known in a few vertebrates: five species of frogs
(Rana_sylvatica, Pseudacris_triseriata, Hyla_crucifer, Hyla_versicolor, Hyla
chrysoscelis), one of salamanders (Hynobius keyserlingi), one of snakes
(Thamnophis_sirtalis) and three of turtles (Chrysemys_picta, Terrapene
carolina, Terrapene_ornata).[3] Snapping turtles Chelydra_serpentina and wall
lizards Podarcis_muralis also survive nominal freezing but it has not been
established to be adaptive for overwintering. In the case of Rana sylvatica one
cryopreservant is ordinary glucose, which increases in concentration by
approximately 19 mmol/l when the frogs are cooled slowly.[3]
***** History[edit] *****
See also: Cryonics_Â§ History
One of the most important early theoreticians of cryopreservation was James
Lovelock. In 1953, he suggested that damage to red_blood_cells during freezing
was due to osmotic stress,[4] and that increasing the salt concentration in a
dehydrating cell might damage it.[5][6] In the mid-1950s, he experimented with
the cryopreservation of rodents, determining that hamsters could be frozen with
60% of the water in the brain crystallized into ice with no adverse effects;
other organs were shown to be susceptible to damage.[7] This work led other
scientists to attempt the short-term freezing of rats by 1955, which were fully
active 4 to 7 days after being revived.[8]
Cryopreservation was applied to humans beginning in 1954 with three pregnancies
resulting from the insemination of previously frozen sperm.[9] Fowl sperm was
cryopreserved in 1957 by a team of scientists in the UK directed by Christopher
Polge.[10] During 1963, Peter Mazur, at Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory in the
U.S., demonstrated that lethal intracellular freezing could be avoided if
cooling was slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during
progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. That rate differs between
cells of differing size and water permeability: a typical cooling rate around
1 Â°C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with
cryoprotectants such as glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide, but the rate is not a
universal optimum.[11]
The first human body to be frozen with the hope of future revival was James
Bedford's, a few hours after his cancer-caused death in 1967.[12] Bedford is
the only cryonics patient frozen before 1974 still preserved today.[13]
***** Temperature[edit] *****
Storage at very low temperatures is presumed to provide an indefinite longevity
to cells, although the actual effective life is rather difficult to prove.
Researchers experimenting with dried seeds found that there was noticeable
variability of deterioration when samples were kept at different temperatures
â even ultra-cold temperatures. Temperatures less than the glass_transition
point (Tg) of polyol's water solutions, around â136 Â°C (137 K; â213 Â°F),
seem to be accepted as the range where biological_activity very substantially
slows, and â196 Â°C (77 K; â321 Â°F), the boiling point of liquid_nitrogen,
is the preferred temperature for storing important specimens. While
refrigerators, freezers and extra-cold freezers are used for many items,
generally the ultra-cold of liquid nitrogen is required for successful
preservation of the more complex biological structures to virtually stop all
biological activity.
***** Risks[edit] *****
Phenomena which can cause damage to cells during cryopreservation mainly occur
during the freezing stage, and include: solution effects, extracellular ice
formation, dehydration and intracellular ice formation. Many of these effects
can be reduced by cryoprotectants. Once the preserved material has become
frozen, it is relatively safe from further damage. However, estimates based on
the accumulation of radiation-induced DNA damage during cryonic storage have
suggested a maximum storage period of 1000 years.[14]
  Solution effects
      As ice crystals grow in freezing water, solutes are excluded, causing
      them to become concentrated in the remaining liquid water. High
      concentrations of some solutes can be very damaging.
  Extracellular ice formation
      When tissues are cooled slowly, water migrates out of cells and ice forms
      in the extracellular space. Too much extracellular ice can cause
      mechanical damage to the cell membrane due to crushing.
  Dehydration
      Migration of water, causing extracellular ice formation, can also cause
      cellular dehydration. The associated stresses on the cell can cause
      damage directly.
  Intracellular ice formation
      While some organisms and tissues can tolerate some extracellular ice, any
      appreciable intracellular ice is almost always fatal to cells.
***** Main methods to prevent risks[edit] *****
The main techniques to prevent cryopreservation damages are a well established
combination of controlled rate and slow freezing and a newer flash-freezing
process known as vitrification.
**** Slow programmable freezing[edit] ****
A tank of liquid_nitrogen, used to supply a cryogenic freezer (for storing
laboratory samples at a temperature of about â150 Â°C)
Controlled-rate and slow freezing, also known as slow programmable freezing
(SPF),[15] is a set of well established techniques developed during the early
1970s which enabled the first human embryo frozen birth Zoe Leyland during
1984. Since then, machines that freeze biological samples using programmable
sequences, or controlled rates, have been used all over the world for human,
animal and cell biology â "freezing down" a sample to better preserve it for
eventual thawing, before it is frozen, or cryopreserved, in liquid nitrogen.
Such machines are used for freezing oocytes, skin, blood products, embryo,
sperm, stem cells and general tissue preservation in hospitals, veterinary
practices and research laboratories around the world. As an example, the number
of live births from frozen embryos 'slow frozen' is estimated at some 300,000
to 400,000 or 20% of the estimated 3 million in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
births.[16]
Lethal intracellular freezing can be avoided if cooling is slow enough to
permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the
extracellular fluid. To minimize the growth of extracellular ice crystal growth
and recrystallization,[17] biomaterials such as alginates, polyvinyl_alcohol or
chitosan can be used to impede ice crystal growth along with traditional small
molecule cryoprotectants.[18] That rate differs between cells of differing size
and water permeability: a typical cooling rate of about 1 Â°C/minute is
appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with cryoprotectants such
as glycerol or dimethyl_sulfoxide, but the rate is not a universal optimum. The
1 Â°C / minute rate can be achieved by using devices such as a rate-controlled
freezer or a benchtop portable freezing container.[19]
Several independent studies have provided evidence that frozen embryos stored
using slow-freezing techniques may in some ways be 'better' than fresh in IVF.
The studies indicate that using frozen embryos and eggs rather than fresh
embryos and eggs reduced the risk of stillbirth and premature delivery though
the exact reasons are still being explored.
**** Vitrification[edit] ****
Researchers Greg_Fahy and William F. Rall helped to introduce vitrification to
reproductive cryopreservation in the mid-1980s.[20] As of 2000, researchers
claim vitrification provides the benefits of cryopreservation without damage
due to ice crystal formation.[21] The situation became more complex with the
development of tissue engineering as both cells and biomaterials need to remain
ice-free to preserve high cell viability and functions, integrity of constructs
and structure of biomaterials. Vitrification of tissue engineered constructs
was first reported by Lilia Kuleshova,[22] who also was the first scientist to
achieve vitrification of oocytes, which resulted in live birth in 1999.[23] For
clinical cryopreservation, vitrification usually requires the addition of
cryoprotectants prior to cooling. The cryoprotectants act like antifreeze: they
decrease the freezing temperature. They also increase the viscosity. Instead of
crystallizing, the syrupy solution becomes an amorphous_iceâit vitrifies.
Rather than a phase change from liquid to solid by crystallization, the
amorphous state is like a "solid liquid", and the transformation is over a
small temperature range described as the "glass_transition" temperature.
Vitrification of water is promoted by rapid cooling, and can be achieved
without cryoprotectants by an extremely rapid decrease of temperature
(megakelvins per second). The rate that is required to attain glassy state in
pure water was considered to be impossible until 2005.[24]
Two conditions usually required to allow vitrification are an increase of the
viscosity and a decrease of the freezing temperature. Many solutes do both, but
larger molecules generally have a larger effect, particularly on viscosity.
Rapid cooling also promotes vitrification.
For established methods of cryopreservation, the solute must penetrate the cell
membrane in order to achieve increased viscosity and decrease freezing
temperature inside the cell. Sugars do not readily permeate through the
membrane. Those solutes that do, such as dimethyl_sulfoxide, a common
cryoprotectant, are often toxic in intense concentration. One of the difficult
compromises of vitrifying cryopreservation concerns limiting the damage
produced by the cryoprotectant itself due to cryoprotectant toxicity. Mixtures
of cryoprotectants and the use of ice blockers have enabled the Twenty-First
Century_Medicine company to vitrify a rabbit kidney to â135 Â°C with their
proprietary vitrification mixture. Upon rewarming, the kidney was transplanted
successfully into a rabbit, with complete functionality and viability, able to
sustain the rabbit indefinitely as the sole functioning kidney.[25]
**** Persufflation[edit] ****
Blood can be replaced with inert noble_gases and/or metabolically vital gases
like oxygen, so that organs can cool more quickly and less antifreeze is
needed. Since regions of tissue are separated by gas, small expansions do not
accumulate, thereby protecting against shattering.[26] A small company, Arigos
Biomedical, "has already recovered pig hearts from the 120 degrees below zero",
[27] although the definition of "recovered" is not clear. Pressures of 60 atm
can help increase heat exchange rates.[28] Gaseous oxygen perfusion/
persufflation can enhance organ preservation relative to static cold storage or
hypothermic machine perfusion, since the lower viscosity of gases, may help
reach more regions of preserved organs and deliver more oxygen per gram tissue.
[29]
***** Freezable tissues[edit] *****
Generally, cryopreservation is easier for thin samples and small clumps of
individual cells, because these can be cooled more quickly and so require
lesser doses of toxic cryoprotectants. Therefore, cryopreservation of human
livers and hearts for storage and transplant is still impractical.
Nevertheless, suitable combinations of cryoprotectants and regimes of cooling
and rinsing during warming often allow the successful cryopreservation of
biological materials, particularly cell suspensions or thin tissue samples.
Examples include:
    * Semen in semen_cryopreservation
    * Blood
          o Special cells for transfusion
          o Stem_cells. It is optimal in high concentration of synthetic serum,
            stepwise equilibration and slow cooling.[30]
          o Umbilical_cord_blood Further information: Cord_blood
            bank#Cryopreservation
    * Tissue samples like tumors and histological_cross_sections
    * Eggs (oocytes) in oocyte_cryopreservation
    * Embryos at cleavage stage (that are 2, 4 or 8 cells) or at blastocyst
      stage, in embryo_cryopreservation
    * Ovarian_tissue in ovarian_tissue_cryopreservation
    * Plant seeds or shoots may be cryopreserved for conservation purposes.
Additionally, efforts are underway to preserve humans cryogenically, known as
cryonics. For such efforts either the brain within the head or the entire body
may experience the above process. Cryonics is in a different category from the
aforementioned examples, however: while countless cryopreserved cells,
vaccines, tissue and other biological samples have been thawed and used
successfully, this has not yet been the case at all for cryopreserved brains or
bodies. At issue are the criteria for defining "success".
Proponents of cryonics claim that cryopreservation using present technology,
particularly vitrification of the brain, may be sufficient to preserve people
in an "information_theoretic" sense so that they could be revived and made
whole by hypothetical vastly advanced future technology. Not only is there no
guarantee of its success, many people[who?] argue that human cryopreservation
is unethical. According to certain views[which?] of the mind body problem, some
philosophers[who?] believe that the mind, which contains thoughts, memories,
and personality, is separate from the brain. When someone dies, their mind
leaves the body. If a cryopreserved patient gets successfully resuscitated, no
one knows if they would be the same person that they once were or if they would
be an empty shell of the memory of who they once were.[improper_synthesis?]
Right now scientists are trying to see if transplanting cryopreserved human
organs for transplantation is viable, if so this would be a major step forward
for the possibility of reviving a cryopreserved human.[31]
**** Embryos[edit] ****
Main article: Embryo_cryopreservation
Cryopreservation for embryos is used for embryo storage, e.g., when in_vitro
fertilization (IVF) has resulted in more embryos than is currently needed.
Pregnancies have been reported from embryos stored for 16 years.[32] Many
studies have evaluated the children born from frozen embryos, or
âfrostiesâ. The result has been uniformly positive with no increase in
birth defects or development abnormalities.[33] A study of more than 11,000
cryopreserved human embryos showed no significant effect of storage time on
post-thaw survival for IVF or oocyte donation cycles, or for embryos frozen at
the pronuclear or cleavage stages.[34] Additionally, the duration of storage
did not have any significant effect on clinical pregnancy, miscarriage,
implantation, or live birth rate, whether from IVF or oocyte donation cycles.
[34] Rather, oocyte age, survival proportion, and number of transferred embryos
are predictors of pregnancy outcome.[34]
**** Ovarian tissue[edit] ****
Main article: Ovarian_tissue_cryopreservation
Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is of interest to women who want to preserve
their reproductive function beyond the natural limit, or whose reproductive
potential is threatened by cancer therapy,[35] for example in hematologic
malignancies or breast cancer.[36] The procedure is to take a part of the ovary
and perform slow freezing before storing it in liquid nitrogen whilst therapy
is undertaken. Tissue can then be thawed and implanted near the fallopian,
either orthotopic (on the natural location) or heterotopic (on the abdominal
wall),[36] where it starts to produce new eggs, allowing normal conception to
occur.[37] The ovarian tissue may also be transplanted into mice that are
immunocompromised (SCID_mice) to avoid graft_rejection, and tissue can be
harvested later when mature follicles have developed.[38]
**** Oocytes[edit] ****
Main article: Oocyte_cryopreservation
Human oocyte cryopreservation is a new technology in which a womanâs eggs
(oocytes) are extracted, frozen and stored. Later, when she is ready to become
pregnant, the eggs can be thawed, fertilized, and transferred to the uterus as
embryos. Since 1999, when the birth of the first baby from an embryo derived
from vitrified-warmed womanâs eggs was reported by Kuleshova and co-workers
in the journal of Human Reproduction,[22] this concept has been recognized and
widespread. This break-through in achieving vitrification of womanâs oocytes
made an important advance in our knowledge and practice of the IVF process, as
clinical pregnancy rate is four times higher after oocyte vitrification than
after slow freezing.[39] Oocyte vitrification is vital for preservation
fertility in young oncology patients and for individuals undergoing IVF who
object, either for religious or ethical reasons, to the practice of freezing
embryos.
**** Semen[edit] ****
Main article: Semen_cryopreservation
Semen can be used successfully almost indefinitely after cryopreservation. The
longest reported successful storage is 22 years.[40] It can be used for sperm
donation where the recipient wants the treatment in a different time or place,
or as a means of preserving fertility for men undergoing vasectomy or
treatments that may compromise their fertility, such as chemotherapy, radiation
therapy or surgery.
**** Testicular tissue[edit] ****
Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue is a developing method to avail
reproduction to young boys who need to have gonadotoxic therapy. Animal data
are promising, since healthy offspring have been obtained after transplantation
of frozen testicular cell suspensions or tissue pieces. However, none of the
fertility restoration options from frozen tissue, i.e. cell suspension
transplantation, tissue_grafting and in_vitro_maturation (IVM) has proved
efficient and safe in humans as yet.[41]
**** Moss[edit] ****
Four different ecotypes of Physcomitrella_patens stored at the IMSC.
Cryopreservation of whole moss plants, especially Physcomitrella_patens, has
been developed by Ralf_Reski and coworkers[42] and is performed at the
International_Moss_Stock_Center. This biobank collects, preserves, and
distributes moss mutants and moss ecotypes.[43]
**** Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)[edit] ****
MSCs, when transfused immediately within a few hours post-thawing, may show
reduced function or show decreased efficacy in treating diseases as compared to
those MSCs which are in log phase of cell growth (fresh). As a result,
cryopreserved MSCs should be brought back into log phase of cell growth in in
vitro culture before these are administered for clinical trials or experimental
therapies. Re-culturing of MSCs will help in recovering from the shock the
cells get during freezing and thawing. Various clinical trials on MSCs have
failed which used cryopreserved products immediately post-thaw as compared to
those clinical trials which used fresh MSCs.[44]
***** Preservation of microbiology cultures[edit] *****
Bacteria and fungi can be kept short-term (months to about a year, depending)
refrigerated, however, cell division and metabolism is not completely arrested
and thus is not an optimal option for long-term storage (years) or to preserve
cultures genetically or phenotypically, as cell divisions can lead to mutations
or sub-culturing can cause phenotypic changes. A preferred option, species-
dependent, is cryopreservation. Nematode worms are the only multicellular
eukaryotes that have been shown to survive cryopreservation. [45]Shatilovich

Sections. 480 (1): 100â102. doi:10.1134/S0012496618030079. PMID 30009350.
**** Fungi[edit] ****
Fungi, notably zygomycetes, ascomycetes and higher basidiomycetes, regardless
of sporulation, are able to be stored in liquid nitrogen or deep-frozen.
Crypreservation is a hallmark method for fungi that do not sporulate (otherwise
other preservation methods for spores can be used at lower costs and ease),
sporulate but have delicate spores (large or freeze-dry sensitive), are
pathogenic (dangerous to keep metabolically active fungus) or are to be used
for genetic stocks (ideally to have identical composition as the original
deposit). As with many other organisms, cryoprotectants like DMSO or glycerol
(e.g. filamentous fungi 10% glycerol or yeast 20% glycerol) are used.
Differences between choosing cryoprotectants are species (or class) dependent,
but generally for fungi penetrating cryoprotectants like DMSO, glycerol or
polyethylene glycol are most effective (other non-penetrating ones include
sugars mannitol, sorbitol, dextran, etc.). Freeze-thaw repetition is not
recommended as it can decrease viability. Back-up deep-freezers or liquid
nitrogen storage sites are recommended. Multiple protocols for freezing are
summarized below (each uses screw-cap polypropylene cryotubes):[46]
**** Bacteria[edit] ****
Many common culturable laboratory strains are deep-frozen to preserve
genetically and phenotypically stable, long-term stocks. Sub-culturing and
prolonged refrigerated samples may lead to loss of plasmid(s) or mutations.
Common final glycerol percentages are 15, 20 and 25. From a fresh culture
plate, one single colony of interest is chosen and liquid culture is made. From
the liquid culture, the medium is directly mixed with equal amount of glycerol;
the colony should be checked for any defects like mutations. All antibiotics
should be washed from the culture before long-term storage. Methods vary, but
mixing can be done gently by inversion or rapidly by vortex and cooling can
vary by either placing the cryotube directly at â50 to â95 Â°C, shock-
freezing in liquid nitrogen or gradually cooling and then storing at â80 Â°C
or cooler (liquid nitrogen or liquid nitrogen vapor). Recovery of bacteria can
also vary, namely if beads are stored within the tube then the few beads can be
used to plate or the frozen stock can be scraped with a loop and then plated,
however, since only little stock is needed the entire tube should never be
completely thawed and repeated freeze-thaw should be avoided. 100% recovery is
not feasible regardless of methodology.[47][48][49]
**** Worms[edit] ****
The microscopic soil-dwelling nematode roundworms Panagrolaimus_detritophagus
and Plectus_parvus are the only eukaryotic organisms that have been proven to
be viable after long-term cryopreservation to date. In this case, the
preservation was natural rather than artificial, due to permafrost.
