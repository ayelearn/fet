Somaclonal variation is the variation seen in plants that have been produced by
plant_tissue_culture. Chromosomal rearrangements are an important source of
this variation. The term somaclonal variation is a phenomenon of broad
taxonomic occurrence, reported for species of different ploidy levels, and for
outcrossing and inbreeding, vegetatively and seed propagated, and cultivated
and non-cultivated plants. Characters affected include both qualitative and
quantitative traits.
Somaclonal variation is not restricted to, but is particularly common in,
plants regenerated from callus. The variations can be genotypic or phenotypic,
which in the latter case can be either genetic or epigenetic in origin. Typical
genetic alterations are: changes in chromosome numbers (polyploidy and
aneuploidy), chromosome structure (translocations, deletions, insertions and
duplications) and DNA sequence (base mutations). A typical epigenetics-related
event would be gene_methylation.[1][2]
If no visual, morphogenic changes are apparent, other plant screening
procedures must be applied. There are both benefits and disadvantages to
somaclonal variation. The phenomenon of high variability in individuals from
plant cell cultures or adventitious shoots has been named somaclonal variation.

***** Advantages[edit] *****
The major likely benefit of somaclonal variation is plant/crop improvement.
Somaclonal variation leads to the creation of additional genetic variability.
Characteristics for which somaclonal mutants can be enriched during in vitro
culture includes resistance to disease pathotoxins, herbicides, high salt
concentration, mineral toxicity and tolerance to environmental or chemical
stress, as well as for increased production of secondary metabolites.
Suitable for breeding of new species.
***** Disadvantages[edit] *****
A serious disadvantage of somaclonal variation occurs in operations which
require clonal uniformity, as in the horticulture and forestry industries where
tissue culture is employed for rapid propagation of elite genotypes.
    * Sometimes leads to undesirable results
    * Selected variants are random and genetically unstable
    * Require extensive and extended field trials
    * Not suitable for complex agronomic traits like yield, quality etc.
    * May develop variants with pleiotropic effects.
***** Reducing somaclonal variation[edit] *****
Different steps can be used to reduce somaclonal variation. It is well known
that increasing numbers of subculture increases the likelihood of somaclonal
variation, so the number of subcultures in micropropagation protocols should be
kept to a minimum. Regular reinitiation of clones from new explants might
reduce variability over time. Another way of reducing somaclonal variation is
to avoid 2,4-D in the culture medium, as this hormone is known to introduce
variation. Vitrification, commonly referred to as hyperhydricity in the tissue
culture world, may be a problem in some species. Hyperhydricity is a
physiological malformation that results in excessive hydration, low
lignification, impaired stomatal function and reduced mechanical strength of
tissue culture-generated plants. In case of forest trees, mature elite trees
can be identified and rapidly cloned by this technique.[citation_needed]
High production cost has limited the application of this technique to more
valuable ornamental crops and some fruit trees.
