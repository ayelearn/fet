The gums or gingiva (plural: gingivae), consist of the mucosal tissue that lies
over the mandible and maxilla inside the mouth. Gum health and disease can have
an effect on general health.[1]

***** Structure[edit] *****
The gums are part of the soft_tissue lining of the mouth. They surround the
teeth and provide a seal around them. Unlike the soft tissue linings of the
lips and cheeks, most of the gums are tightly bound to the underlying bone
which helps resist the friction of food passing over them. Thus when healthy,
it presents an effective barrier to the barrage of periodontal insults to
deeper tissue. Healthy gums are usually coral pink in light skinned people, but
may be naturally darker with melanin pigmentation.
Changes in color, particularly increased redness, together with swelling and an
increased tendency to bleed, suggest an inflammation that is possibly due to
the accumulation of bacterial_plaque. Overall, the clinical appearance of the
tissue reflects the underlying histology, both in health and disease. When gum
tissue is not healthy, it can provide a gateway for periodontal disease to
advance into the deeper tissue of the periodontium, leading to a poorer
prognosis for long-term retention of the teeth. Both the type of periodontal
therapy and homecare instructions given to patients by dental professionals and
restorative care are based on the clinical conditions of the tissue.[2]

The gums are divided anatomically into marginal, attached and interdental
areas.
**** Marginal gums[edit] ****
The marginal gum is the edge of the gums surrounding the teeth in collar-like
fashion. In about half of individuals, it is demarcated from the adjacent,
attached gums by a shallow linear depression, the free gingival groove. This
slight depression on the outer surface of the gum does not correspond to the
depth of the gingival sulcus but instead to the apical border of the junctional
epithelium. This outer groove varies in depth according to the area of the oral
cavity; the groove is very prominent on mandibular anteriors and premolars.
The marginal gum varies in width from 0.5 to 2.0 mm from the free gingival
crest to the attached gingiva. The marginal gingiva follows the scalloped
pattern established by the contour of the cementoenamel_junction (CEJ) of the
teeth. The marginal gingiva has a more translucent appearance than the attached
gingiva, yet has a similar clinical appearance, including pinkness, dullness,
and firmness. In contrast, the marginal gingiva lacks the presence of
stippling, and the tissue is mobile or free from the underlying tooth surface,
as can be demonstrated with a periodontal probe. The marginal gingiva is
stabilized by the gingival_fibers that have no bony support. The gingival
margin, or free gingival crest, at the most superficial part of the marginal
gingiva, is also easily seen clinically, and its location should be recorded on
a patientâs chart.[2]
**** Attached gum[edit] ****
The attached gums are continuous with the marginal gum. It is firm, resilient,
and tightly bound to the underlying periosteum of alveolar bone. The facial
aspect of the attached gum extends to the relatively loose and movable alveolar
mucosa, from which it is demarcated by the mucogingival_junction. Attached gum
may present with surface_stippling. The tissue when dried is dull, firm, and
immobile, with varying amounts of stippling. The width of the attached gum
varies according to its location. The width of the attached gum on the facial
aspect differs in different areas of the mouth. It is generally greatest in the
incisor region (3.5 to 4.5 mm in the maxilla and 3.3 to 3.9 mm in the mandible)
and less in the posterior segments, with the least width in the first premolar
area (1.9 mm in the maxilla and 1.8 mm in the mandible). However, certain
levels of attached gum may be necessary for the stability of the underlying
root of the tooth.[2]
**** Interdental gum[edit] ****
The interdental gum lies between the teeth. They occupy the gingival embrasure,
which is the interproximal space beneath the area of tooth contact. The
interdental_papilla can be pyramidal or have a "col" shape. Attached gums are
resistant to the forces of chewing and covered in keratin.
The col varies in depth and width, depending on the expanse of the contacting
tooth surfaces. The epithelium covering the col consists of the marginal gum of
the adjacent teeth, except that it is nonkeratinized. It is mainly present in
the broad interdental gingiva of the posterior teeth, and generally is not
present with those interproximal tissue associated with anterior teeth because
the latter tissue is narrower. In the absence of contact between adjacent
teeth, the attached gum extends uninterrupted from the facial to the lingual
aspect. The col may be important in the formation of periodontal disease but is
visible clinically only when teeth are extracted.[2]
  Interdental Areas
It is the part of gum which extends in between two teeth up to the contact
point. There is a facial side interdental papilla and a lingual side
interdental papilla. Interdental papilla has a summit and margins that are
concave. The tip and the margins are unattached and the central portion
attached. In inflammations the interdental papilla loses its concavity.
***** Characteristics of healthy gums[edit] *****
**** Color[edit] ****
Healthy gums usually have a color that has been described as "coral pink."
Other colours like red, white, and blue can signify inflammation (gingivitis)
or pathology. Although described as the colour coral pink, variation in colour
is possible. This can be the result of factors such as: thickness and degree of
keratinization of the epithelium, blood flow to the gums, natural pigmentation,
disease and medications.[3]
Since the colour of the gums can vary, uniformity of colour is more important
than the underlying color itself. Excess deposits of melanin can cause dark
spots or patches on the gums (melanin gingival hyperpigmentation), especially
at the base of the interdental papillae. Gum_depigmentation (aka gum bleaching)
is a procedure used in cosmetic dentistry to remove these discolorations.
**** Contour[edit] ****
Healthy gums have a smooth curved or scalloped appearance around each tooth.
Healthy gums fill and fit each space between the teeth, unlike the swollen gum
papilla seen in gingivitis or the empty interdental embrasure seen in
periodontal disease. Healthy gums hold tight to each tooth in that the gum
surface narrows to "knife-edge" thin at the free_gingival_margin. On the other
hand, inflamed gums have a "puffy" or "rolled" margin.
**** Texture[edit] ****
Healthy gums have a firm texture that is resistant to movement, and the surface
texture often exhibits surface_stippling. Unhealthy gums, on the other hand, is
often swollen and less firm. Healthy gums have an orange-peel like texture to
it due to the stippling.
**** Reaction to disturbance[edit] ****
Healthy gums usually have no reaction to normal disturbance such as brushing or
periodontal_probing. Unhealthy gums, conversely, will show bleeding_on_probing
(BOP) and/or purulent_exudate.
***** Clinical significance[edit] *****
The gingival cavity microecosystem, fueled by food residues and saliva, can
support the growth of many microorganisms, of which some can be injurious to
health. Improper or insufficient oral_hygiene can thus lead to many gum and
periodontal disorders, including gingivitis or periodontitis, which are major
causes for tooth failure. Recent studies have also shown that anabolic_steroids
are also closely associated with gingival_enlargement requiring a gingivectomy
for many cases. Gingival_recession is when there is an apical movement of the
gum margin away from the biting (occlusal) surface.[4] It may indicate an
underlying inflammation such as periodontitis[5] or pyorrhea,[5] a pocket
formation, dry_mouth[5] or displacement of the marginal_gums away from the
tooth by mechanical (such as brushing),[5] chemical, or surgical means.[6]
Gingival retraction, in turn, may expose the dental neck and leave it
vulnerable to the action of external stimuli, and may cause root sensitivity.
