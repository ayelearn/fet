Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of
which are used in food. The various types of sugar are derived from different
sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also
known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. "Table sugar" or "granulated
sugar" refers to sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. In the body,
sucrose is hydrolysed into fructose and glucose.
Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants, but sucrose is especially
concentrated in sugarcane and sugar_beet, making them ideal for efficient
commercial extraction to make refined sugar. Sugarcane originated in tropical
Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia,[1] and is known of from_before_6,000
BP, sugar beet was first_described_in_writing (1575) by Olivier_de_Serres and
originated in southwestern,_northern_and_Southeast_Europe_along_the_Atlantic
coasts_and_the_Mediterranean_Sea,_in_North_Africa,_Macaronesia,_to_Western
Asia. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two
billion tonnes. Other disaccharides include maltose (from malted grain) and
lactose (from milk). Longer chains of sugar molecules are called
oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Some other chemical substances, such as
glycerol and sugar_alcohols, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as
sugar.

Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes added
to_commercially_available_beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener
for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The
average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 lb) of sugar each year, or 33.1
kilograms (73 lb) in developed_countries, equivalent to over 260 food_calories
per day. As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century,
researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined
sugar, was damaging to human_health. Excessive consumption of sugar has been
implicated in the onset of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular_disease, dementia,
and tooth_decay. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but
with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations
for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015, the World_Health
Organization recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free
sugars to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total
energy_intake.[2]

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The etymology reflects the spread of the commodity. From Sanskrit (ÅarkarÄ),
meaning "ground or candied sugar," came Persian shakar, then to 12th_century
French sucre and the English sugar.[3]
The English word jaggery, a coarse brown_sugar made from date_palm sap or
sugarcane juice, has a similar etymological origin: Portuguese jÃ¡gara from the
Malayalam cakkarÄ, which is from the Sanskrit ÅarkarÄ.[4]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_sugar
**** Ancient world to Renaissance[edit] ****
Sugar_cane plantation
*** Asia[edit] ***
Sugar has been produced in the Indian_subcontinent[1] since ancient times and
its cultivation spread from there into modern-day Afghanistan through the
Khyber_Pass.[5] It was not plentiful or cheap in early times, and in most parts
of the world, honey was more often used for sweetening. Originally, people
chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Sugarcane was a native of
tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.[1][6]
Different species seem to have originated from different locations with
Saccharum_barberi originating in India and S._edule and S._officinarum coming
from New_Guinea.[6][7] One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane
is in Chinese manuscripts dating to 8th century BCE, which state that the use
of sugarcane originated in India.[8]
In the tradition of Indian medicine (Äyurveda), the sugarcane is known by the
name Iká¹£u and the sugarcane juice is known as PhÄá¹ita. Its varieties,
synonyms and characterics are defined in nighaá¹á¹­us such as the
BhÄvaprakÄÅa (1.6.23, group of sugarcanes).[9] Sugar remained relatively
unimportant until the Indians discovered methods of turning sugarcane_juice
into granulated crystals that were easier to store and to transport.[10]
Crystallized sugar was discovered by the time of the Imperial_Guptas, around
the 5th century CE.[10] In the local Indian language, these crystals were
called khanda (Devanagari: à¤à¤£à¥à¤¡, Khaá¹á¸a), which is the source of
the word candy.[11] Indian sailors, who carried clarified_butter and sugar as
supplies, introduced knowledge of sugar along the various trade_routes they
travelled.[10] Traveling Buddhist monks took sugar crystallization_methods to
China.[12] During the reign of Harsha (r. 606â647) in North_India, Indian
envoys in Tang_China taught methods of cultivating sugarcane after Emperor
Taizong_of_Tang (r. 626â649) made known his interest in sugar. China
established its first sugarcane plantations in the seventh century.[13] Chinese
documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647 CE, to
obtain technology for sugar refining.[14] In the Indian subcontinent,[1] the
Middle East and China, sugar became a staple of cooking and desserts.
*** Europe[edit] ***
Two elaborate sugar triomfi of goddesses for a dinner given by the Earl_of
Castlemaine, British Ambassador in Rome, 1687
Nearchus, admiral of Alexander_of_Macedonia, knew of sugar during the year 325
B.C., because of his participation in the_campaign_of_India led by Alexander
(Arrian, Anabasis).[15][16] The Greek physician Pedanius_Dioscorides in the 1st
century CE described sugar in his medical treatise De_Materia_Medica,[17] and
Pliny_the_Elder, a 1st-century CE Roman, described sugar in his Natural
History: "Sugar is made in Arabia as well, but Indian sugar is better. It is a
kind of honey found in cane, white as gum, and it crunches between the teeth.
It comes in lumps the size of a hazelnut. Sugar is used only for medical
purposes."[18] Crusaders brought sugar back to Europe after their campaigns in
the Holy_Land, where they encountered caravans carrying "sweet salt". Early in
the 12th century, Venice acquired some villages near Tyre and set up estates to
produce sugar for export to Europe. It supplemented the use of honey, which had
previously been the only available sweetener.[19] Crusade chronicler William_of
Tyre, writing in the late 12th century, described sugar as "very necessary for
the use and health of mankind".[20] In the 15th century, Venice was the chief
sugar refining and distribution center in Europe.[8]
There was a drastic change in the mid-15th century, when Madeira and the Canary
Islands were settled from Europe, and sugar grown there.[21] After this an
"all-consuming passion for sugar ... swept through society" as it became far
more easily available, though initially still very expensive.[22] By 1492,
Madeira was producing over three million pounds weight of sugar annually.[23]
Genoa, one of the centers of distribution, became known for candied fruit,
while Venice specialized in pastries, sweets (candies), and sugar_sculptures.
Sugar was considered to have "valuable medicinal properties" as a "warm" food
under prevailing categories, being "helpful to the stomach, to cure cold
diseases, and sooth lung complaints".[24]
A feast given in Tours in 1457 by Gaston_de_Foix, which is "probably the best
and most complete account we have of a late medieval banquet" includes the
first mention of sugar sculptures, as the final food brought in was "a heraldic
menagerie sculpted in sugar: lions, stags, monkeys ... each holding in paw or
beak the arms of the Hungarian king".[25] Other recorded grand feasts in the
decades following included similar pieces.[26] Originally the sculptures seem
to have been eaten in the meal, but later they become merely table decorations,
the most elaborate called triomfi. Several significant sculptors are known to
have produced them; in some cases their preliminary drawings survive. Early
ones were in brown sugar, partly cast in molds, with the final touches carved.
They continued to be used until at least the Coronation Banquet for Edward_VII
of_the_United_Kingdom in 1903; among other sculptures every guest was given a
sugar crown to take away.[27]

In August 1492 Christopher_Columbus stopped at La_Gomera in the Canary_Islands
for wine and water, intending to stay only four days. He became romantically
involved with the governor of the island, Beatriz_de_Bobadilla_y_Ossorio, and
stayed a month. When he finally sailed, she gave him cuttings of sugarcane,
which he carried to the New World. This was the introduction of this plant.[28]
The cuttings were planted and the first sugar-cane harvest in Hispaniola took
place in 1501. Many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the
1520s.[29] The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800
cane-sugar mills in Santa_Catarina_Island and another 2,000 on the north coast
of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam.

Sugar was a luxury in Europe until the 18th century, when it became more widely
available. It became highly popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be
considered[by_whom?] a necessity. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar
as an essential food ingredient resulted in major economic and social changes.
[30] Demand drove, in part, the colonization of tropical islands and areas
where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could be
successful. The demand for cheap labor to perform the labor-intensive
cultivation and processing increased the demand for the slave trade from Africa
(in particular West Africa).
After slavery was abolished, the demand for workers in the British Caribbean
colonies was filled by indentured_laborers from Indian subcontinent (in
particular India).[31][32][33] Millions of slave and indentured laborers were
brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast
Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. Thus the modern ethnic mix of
many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been
influenced by the demand for sugar.[34][35][36]
This is a close-up image of sugar cane. Demand for sugar helped create the
colonial_system in areas where cultivation of sugar cane was profitable.
Sugar also led to some industrialization of areas where sugar cane was grown.
For example, in the 1790s Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment,
promoted to the British Government the idea that sugar cane could grow in
British India, where it had started, with many advantages and at less expense
than in the West Indies. As a result, sugar factories were established in Bihar
in eastern India.[37][38] During the Napoleonic_Wars, sugar-beet production
increased in continental Europe because of the difficulty of importing sugar
when shipping was subject to blockade. By 1880 the sugar beet was the main
source of sugar in Europe. It was also cultivated in Lincolnshire and other
parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part
of its sugar from its colonies.[39]
Until the late nineteenth century, sugar was purchased in loaves, which had to
be cut using implements called sugar_nips.[40] In later years, granulated sugar
was more usually sold in bags. Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth
century. The first inventor of a process to produce sugar in cube form was
Moravian Jakub_KryÅ¡tof_Rad, director of a sugar company in DaÄice. He began
sugar-cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on
January 23, 1843. Henry_Tate of Tate_&_Lyle was another early manufacturer of
sugar cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent
for sugar-cube manufacture from German Eugen_Langen, who in 1872 had invented a
different method of processing of sugar cubes.[41]
Sugar was rationed during World War I and more sharply during World War II.[42]
[43][44][45][46] This led to the development and use of various artificial
sweeteners.[42][47]
***** Chemistry[edit] *****
Sucrose: a disaccharide of glucose (left) and fructose (right), important
molecules in the body.
Main article: Carbohydrate
Scientifically, sugar loosely refers to a number of carbohydrates, such as
monosaccharides, disaccharides, or oligosaccharides. Monosaccharides are also
called "simple sugars," the most important being glucose. Most monosaccharides
have a formula that conforms to C
nH
2nO
n with n between 3 and 7 (deoxyribose being an exception). Glucose has the
molecular_formula C
6H
12O
6. The names of typical sugars end with -ose, as in "glucose" and "fructose".
Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of carbohydrates soluble in
water. The acyclic mono- and disaccharides contain either aldehyde groups or
ketone groups. These carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers.
All saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or
more monosaccharides joined by glycosidic_bonds with the resultant loss of a
molecule of water (H
2O) per bond.[48]
Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with other
monosaccharides, creating disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides
(such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic
bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption
the principal monosaccharides present in the blood and internal tissues include
glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring
structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains
non-free, so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur.
Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less
than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.[48]
**** Natural polymers[edit] ****
Biopolymers of sugars are common in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants
produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is
used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose (C
6H
12O
6) or (as in cane and beet) sucrose (C
12H
22O
11). Monosaccharides may be further converted into structural_polysaccharides
such as cellulose and pectin for cell_wall construction or into energy reserves
in the form of storage_polysaccharides such as starch or inulin. Starch,
consisting of two different polymers of glucose, is a readily degradable form
of chemical energy stored by cells, and can be converted to other types of
energy.[48] Another polymer of glucose is cellulose, which is a linear chain
composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units. It is used by plants as
a structural component in their cell walls. Humans can digest cellulose only to
a very limited extent, though ruminants can do so with the help of symbiotic
bacteria in their gut.[49] DNA and RNA are built up of the monosaccharides
deoxyribose and ribose, respectively. Deoxyribose has the formula C
5H
10O
4 and ribose the formula C
5H
10O
5.[50]
**** Flammability and heat response[edit] ****
Magnification of grains of refined sucrose, the most common free sugar.
Because sugars burn easily when exposed to flame, the handling of sugars risks
dust_explosion. The risk of explosion is higher when the sugar has been milled
to superfine texture, such as for use in chewing_gum.[51] The 2008_Georgia
sugar_refinery_explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed
most of the refinery, was caused by the ignition of sugar dust.
In its culinary use, exposing sugar to heat causes caramelization. As the
process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the
characteristic caramel flavor.
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Monosaccharides[edit] ****
Fructose, galactose, and glucose are all simple sugars, monosaccharides, with
the general formula C6H12O6. They have five hydroxyl groups (âOH) and a
carbonyl group (C=O) and are cyclic when dissolved in water. They each exist as
several isomers with dextro- and laevo-rotatory forms that cause polarized
light to diverge to the right or the left.[52]
    * Fructose, or fruit sugar, occurs naturally in fruits, some root
      vegetables, cane sugar and honey and is the sweetest of the sugars. It is
      one of the components of sucrose or table sugar. It is used as a high-
      fructose_syrup, which is manufactured from hydrolyzed corn starch that
      has been processed to yield corn_syrup, with enzymes then added to
      convert part of the glucose into fructose.[53]
    * Galactose generally does not occur in the free state but is a constituent
      with glucose of the disaccharide lactose or milk sugar. It is less sweet
      than glucose. It is a component of the antigens found on the surface of
      red_blood_cells that determine blood_groups.[54]
    * Glucose, dextrose or grape sugar, occurs naturally in fruits and plant
      juices and is the primary product of photosynthesis. Most ingested
      carbohydrates are converted into glucose during digestion and it is the
      form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the
      bloodstream. Glucose syrup is a liquid form of glucose that is widely
      used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch
      by enzymatic_hydrolysis.[55]
**** Disaccharides[edit] ****
Lactose, maltose, and sucrose are all compound sugars, disaccharides, with the
general formula C12H22O11. They are formed by the combination of two
monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water.[52]
    * Lactose is the naturally occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of
      lactose is formed by the combination of a molecule of galactose with a
      molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent
      parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme
      but some adults no longer form it and they are unable to digest lactose.
      [56]
    * Maltose is formed during the germination of certain grains, the most
      notable being barley, which is converted into malt, the source of the
      sugar's name. A molecule of maltose is formed by the combination of two
      molecules of glucose. It is less sweet than glucose, fructose or sucrose.
      [52] It is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the
      enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme
      maltase.[57]
    * Sucrose is found in the stems of sugarcane and roots of sugar beet. It
      also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in
      particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different
      proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of
      sweetness experienced when eating them.[52] A molecule of sucrose is
      formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of
      fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts
      during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.[58]

Due to rising demand, sugar production in general increased some 14% over the
period 2009 to 2018.[61] The largest importers were China, Indonesia, and the
United States.[61]
**** Sugar beet[edit] ****
In 2016, global production of sugar_beets was 277 million tonnes, led by Russia
with 19% of the world total (table).
The sugar beet became a major source of sugar in the 19th_century when methods
for extracting the sugar became available. It is a biennial_plant,[62] a
cultivated_variety of Beta_vulgaris in the family Amaranthaceae, the tuberous
root of which contains a high proportion of sucrose. It is cultivated as a root
crop in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil.
The crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and
excess soil removed. The roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in
the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant where
the crop is washed and sliced, and the sugar extracted by diffusion.[63] Milk
of_lime is added to the raw juice with calcium_carbonate. After water is
evaporated by boiling the syrup under a vacuum, the syrup is cooled and seeded
with sugar crystals. The white_sugar that crystallizes can be separated in a
centrifuge and dried, requiring no further refining.[63]

Global production of sugarcane in 2016 was 1.9 billion tonnes, with Brazil
producing 41% of the world total and India 18% (table).
Sugarcane refers to any of several species, or their hybrids, of giant grasses
in the genus Saccharum in the family Poaceae. They have been cultivated in
tropical climates in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia over centuries
for the sucrose found in their stems.[1] A great expansion in sugarcane
production took place in the 18th_century with the establishment of slave
plantations in the Americas. The use of slavery for the labor-intensive process
resulted in sugar production, enabling prices cheap enough for most people to
buy. Mechanization reduced some labor needs, but in the 21st_century,
cultivation and production relied on low-wage laborers.
Sugar cane requires a frost-free climate with sufficient rainfall during the
growing season to make full use of the plant's substantial growth potential.
The crop is harvested mechanically or by hand, chopped into lengths and
conveyed rapidly to the processing_plant (commonly known as a sugar_mill) where
it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by
diffusion.[65] The juice is clarified with lime and heated to destroy enzymes.
The resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators, after
which further water is removed. The resulting supersaturated solution is seeded
with sugar crystals, facilitating crystal formation and drying.[65] Molasses is
a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems, known as bagasse,[65]
is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process. The crystals of
raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are, can
be bleached by sulfur_dioxide, or can be treated in a carbonatation process to
produce a whiter product.[65] About 2,500 litres (660 US gal) of irrigation
water is needed for every one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar produced.[66]
**** Refining[edit] ****
See also: Sugar_refinery, Non-centrifugal_cane_sugar, and White_sugar
A pack of sugar made from sugar beet
Refined sugar is made from raw sugar that has undergone a refining process to
remove the molasses.[67][68] Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from
sugarcane or sugar_beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process
removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or white_sugar.[69][70]
The sugar may be transported in bulk to the country where it will be used and
the refining process often takes place there. The first stage is known as
affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup
that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The
crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The
resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation
process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when
this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time.
Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated_carbon or an
ion-exchange_resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled
and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The
liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air
and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners'
molasses.[71]
The International_Commission_for_Uniform_Methods_of_Sugar_Analysis sets
standards for the measurement of the purity of refined sugar, known as ICUMSA
numbers; lower numbers indicate a higher level of purity in the refined sugar.
[72]
Refined sugar is widely used for industrial needs for higher quality. Refined
sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500).[73] The
level of purity associated with the colors of sugar, expressed by standard
number ICUMSA, the smaller ICUMSA numbers indicate the higher purity of sugar.
[73]
***** Forms and uses[edit] *****
Rock_candy crystallized out of a supersaturated_sugar_solution that contains
green dye.
    * Brown_sugars are granulated sugars, either containing residual molasses,
      or with the grains deliberately coated with molasses to produce a light-
      or dark-colored sugar. They are used in baked goods, confectionery, and
      toffees.[74]
    * Granulated sugars are used at the table, to sprinkle on foods and to
      sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness
      and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding
      and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-
      organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied
      fruits, jams, and marmalades.[75]
    * Invert_sugars and syrups are blended to manufacturers specifications and
      are used in breads, cakes, and beverages for adjusting sweetness, aiding
      moisture retention and avoiding crystallization of sugars.[74]
    * Liquid sugars are strong syrups consisting of 67% granulated sugar
      dissolved in water. They are used in the food processing of a wide range
      of products including beverages, hard_candy, ice_cream, and jams.[74]
    * Low-calorie sugars and artificial sweeteners are often made of
      maltodextrin with added sweeteners. Maltodextrin is an easily digestible
      synthetic polysaccharide consisting of short chains of glucose molecules
      and is made by the partial hydrolysis of starch.[76]
    * Milled sugars (known as confectioner's sugar and powdered sugar) are
      ground to a fine powder. They are used as powdered_sugar (also known as
      icing sugar or confectionary sugar), for dusting foods and in baking and
      confectionery.[74]
    * Molasses is commonly used to make rum, and sugar byproducts are used to
      make ethanol for fuel.
    * Polyols are sugar_alcohols and are used in chewing gums where a sweet
      flavor is required that lasts for a prolonged time in the mouth.[77]
    * Screened sugars are crystalline products separated according to the size
      of the grains. They are used for decorative table sugars, for blending in
      dry mixes and in baking and confectionery.[74]
    * Sugar cubes(de) (sometimes called sugar lumps) are white or brown
      granulated sugars lightly steamed and pressed together in block shape.
      They are used to sweeten drinks.[74]
    * Sugarloaf was the usual cone-form in which refined sugar was produced and
      sold until the late 19th century. This shape is still in use in Germany
      (for preparation of Feuerzangenbowle) as well as Iran and Morocco.
    * Syrups and treacles are dissolved invert sugars heated to develop the
      characteristic flavors. (Treacles have added molasses.) They are used in
      a range of baked goods and confectionery including toffees and licorice.
      [74]
    * In winemaking, fruit_sugars are converted into alcohol by a fermentation
      process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit has a low sugar
      content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of
      the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet
      wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course,
      leaving behind some residual_sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.
      [78]
***** Consumption[edit] *****
In most parts of the world, sugar is an important part of the human diet,
making food more palatable and providing food_energy. After cereals and
vegetable oils, sugar derived from sugarcane and beet provided more
kilocalories per capita per day on average than other food groups.[79]
According to one source, per_capita consumption of sugar in 2016 was highest in
the United States, followed by Germany and the Netherlands.[80]

Brown and white granulated sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates,
respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat
(table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference
Daily_Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams
(one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or
any other nutrient.[81] Because brown sugar contains 5â10% molasses
reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor
than white sugar.[82]
***** Health effects[edit] *****
**** Sugar industry funding and health information[edit] ****
Main article: Sugar_marketing_Â§ Influence_on_health_information_and_guidelines
Sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugary foods and drinks have sought to
influence medical research and public_health recommendations,[83][84] with
substantial and largely clandestine spending documented from the 1960s to 2016.
[85][86][87][88] The results of research on the health effects of sugary food
and drink differ significantly, depending on whether the researcher has
financial ties to the food and drink industry.[89][90][91] A 2013 medical
review concluded that "unhealthy commodity industries should have no role in
the formation of national or international NCD [non-communicable_disease]
policy".[92]
There have been similar efforts to steer coverage of sugar-related health
information in popular media, including news media and social media.[93][94]
[95]
**** Obesity and metabolic syndrome[edit] ****
A 2003 World_Health_Organization technical report provided evidence that high
intake of sugary drinks (including fruit_juice) increased the risk of obesity
by adding to overall energy_intake.[96] By itself, sugar is not a factor
causing obesity and metabolic_syndrome, but rather â when over-consumed â
is a component of unhealthy dietary behavior.[96] Meta-analyses showed that
excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increased the risk of
developing type_2_diabetes and metabolic syndrome â including weight gain and
obesity â in adults and children.[97][98]
**** Addiction[edit] ****
A 2018 systematic_review concluded that the potential for sugar_addiction was
greater when in combination with dietary fats.[99]
**** Hyperactivity[edit] ****
Some studies report evidence of causality between high consumption of refined
sugar and hyperactivity.[100] One review of low-quality studies of children
consuming high amounts of energy_drinks showed association with higher rates of
unhealthy behaviors, including smoking and alcohol abuse, and with
hyperactivity and insomnia.[101]
**** Tooth decay[edit] ****
The 2003 WHO report stated that "Sugars are undoubtedly the most important
dietary factor in the development of dental_caries".[96] A review of human
studies showed that the incidence of caries is lower when sugar intake is less
than 10% of total energy consumed.[102]
**** Nutritional displacement[edit] ****
The "empty_calories" argument states that a diet high in added sugar will
reduce consumption of foods that contain essential_nutrients.[103] This
nutrient displacement occurs if sugar makes up more than 25% of daily energy
intake,[104] a proportion associated with poor diet quality and risk of
obesity.[105] Displacement may occur at lower levels of consumption.[104]
**** Alzheimer's disease[edit] ****
Claims have been made of a sugarâAlzheimer's_disease connection, but there is
inconclusive evidence that cognitive decline is related to dietary fructose or
overall energy intake.[106][107]
**** Recommended dietary intake[edit] ****
The World_Health_Organization recommends that both adults and children reduce
the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake, and suggests
a reduction to below 5%. "Free sugars" include monosaccharides and
disaccharides added to foods, and sugars found in fruit juice and concentrates,
as well as in honey and syrups. According to the WHO, "[t]hese recommendations
were based on the totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the
relationship between free sugars intake and body weight (low and moderate
quality evidence) and dental caries (very low and moderate quality evidence)."
[2]
On May 20, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced changes to the
Nutrition Facts panel displayed on all foods, to be effective by July 2018. New
to the panel is a requirement to list "Added sugars" by weight and as a percent
of Daily Value (DV). For vitamins and minerals, the intent of DVs is to
indicate how much should be consumed. For added sugars, the guidance is that
100% DV should not be exceeded. 100% DV is defined as 50 grams. For a person
consuming 2000 calories a day, 50 grams is equal to 200 calories and thus 10%
of total caloriesâthe same guidance as the World Health Organization.[108] To
put this in context, most 12 ounce (335 mL) cans of soda contain 39 grams of
sugar. In the United States, a government survey on food consumption in
2013â2014 reported that, for men and women aged 20 and older, the average
total sugar intakesânaturally occurring in foods and addedâwere,
respectively, 125 and 99 g/day.[109]
***** Measurements[edit] *****
Various culinary sugars have different densities due to differences in particle
size and inclusion of moisture.
Domino_Sugar gives the following weight to volume conversions (in United_States
customary_units):[110]
    * Firmly packed brown sugar 1 lb = 2.5 cups (or 1.3 L per kg, 0.77 kg/L)
    * Granulated sugar 1 lb = 2.25 cups (or 1.17 L per kg, 0.85 kg/L)
    * Unsifted confectioner's sugar 1 lb = 3.75 cups (or 2.0 L per kg, 0.5 kg/
      L)
The "Engineering Resources â Bulk Density Chart" published in Powder and Bulk
gives different values for the bulk densities:[111]
    * Beet sugar 0.80 g/mL
    * Dextrose sugar 0.62 g/mL ( = 620 kg/m^3)
    * Granulated sugar 0.70 g/mL
    * Powdered sugar 0.56 g/mL
***** Society and culture[edit] *****
Manufacturers of sugary products, such as soft_drinks and candy, and the Sugar
Research_Foundation have been accused of trying to influence consumers and
medical associations in the 1960s and 1970s by creating doubt about the
potential health hazards of sucrose overconsumption, while promoting saturated
fat as the main dietary risk factor in cardiovascular_diseases.[85] In 2016,
the criticism led to recommendations that diet policymakers emphasize the need
for high-quality research that accounts for multiple biomarkers on development
of cardiovascular diseases.[85]
