Food microbiology is the study of the microorganisms that inhibit, create, or
contaminate food, including the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage,
pathogens that may cause disease especially if food is improperly cooked or
stored, those used to produce fermented_foods such as cheese, yogurt, bread,
beer, and wine, and those with other useful roles such as producing probiotics.

***** Food safety[edit] *****
A microbiologist working in a biosafety laboratory tests for high risk
pathogens in food.
Food_safety is a major focus of food microbiology. Numerous agents of disease,
pathogens, are readily transmitted via food, including bacteria, and viruses.
Microbial toxins are also possible contaminants of food. However,
microorganisms and their products can also be used to combat these pathogenic
microbes. Probiotic bacteria, including those that produce bacteriocins, can
kill and inhibit pathogens. Alternatively, purified bacteriocins such as nisin
can be added directly to food products. Finally, bacteriophages, viruses that
only infect bacteria, can be used_to_kill_bacterial_pathogens.[5] Thorough
preparation of food, including proper cooking, eliminates most bacteria and
viruses. However, toxins produced by contaminants may not be liable to change
to non-toxic forms by heating or cooking the contaminated food due to other
safety conditions.
***** Fermentation[edit] *****
See also: Fermentation_in_food_processing and Yeast_in_winemaking
Fermentation is one of the methods to preserve food and alter its quality.
Yeast, especially Saccharomyces_cerevisiae, is used to leaven bread, brew beer
and make wine. Certain bacteria, including lactic_acid_bacteria, are used to
make yogurt, cheese, hot_sauce, pickles, fermented sausages and dishes such as
kimchi. A common effect of these fermentations is that the food product is less
hospitable to other microorganisms, including pathogens and spoilage-causing
microorganisms, thus extending the food's shelf-life. Some cheese varieties
also require molds to ripen and develop their characteristic flavors.
***** Microbial biopolymers[edit] *****
Several microbially produced biopolymers are used in the food_industry.[6]
**** Alginate[edit] ****
Alginates can be used as thickening_agents.[7] Although listed here under the
category 'Microbial polysaccharides', commercial alginates are currently only
produced by extraction from brown_seaweeds such as Laminaria_hyperborea or L.
japonica.
**** Poly-γ-glutamic acid[edit] ****
Poly-Î³-glutamic_acid (Î³-PGA) produced by various strains of Bacillus has
potential applications as a thickener in the food industry.[8]
***** Food testing[edit] *****

To ensure safety_of_food_products, microbiological tests such as testing for
pathogens and spoilage organisms are required. This way the risk of
contamination under normal use conditions can be examined and food_poisoning
outbreaks can be prevented. Testing of food products and ingredients is
important along the whole supply_chain as possible flaws of products can occur
at every stage of production.[9] Apart from detecting spoilage, microbiological
tests can also determine germ content, identify yeasts and molds, and
salmonella. For salmonella, scientists are also developing rapid and portable
technologies capable of identifying unique variants of Salmonella .[10]
Polymerase_Chain_Reaction (PCR) is a quick and inexpensive method to generate
numbers of copies of a DNA fragment at a specific band ("PCR (Polymerase Chain
Reaction)," 2008). For that reason, scientists are using PCR to detect
different kinds of viruses or bacteria, such as HIV and anthrax based on their
unique DNA patterns. Various kits are commercially available to help in food
pathogen nucleic acids extraction,[11] PCR detection, and differentiation.[12]
The detection of bacterial strands in food products is very important to
everyone in the world, for it helps prevent the occurrence of food borne
illness. Therefore, PCR is recognized as a DNA detector in order to amplify and
trace the presence of pathogenic strands in different processed food.
