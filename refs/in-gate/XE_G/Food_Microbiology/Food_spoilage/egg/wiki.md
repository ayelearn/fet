The egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an embryo develops
until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. An egg
results from fertilization of an egg_cell. Most arthropods, vertebrates
(excluding mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions,
do not.
Reptile eggs, bird_eggs, and monotreme eggs are laid out of water and are
surrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible. Eggs laid on
land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range
while the embryo grows. When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches,
i.e., breaks out of the egg's shell. Some embryos have a temporary egg_tooth
they use to crack, pip, or break the eggshell or covering.
The largest recorded egg is from a whale_shark and was 30 cm Ã 14 cm Ã 9 cm
(11.8 in Ã 5.5 in Ã 3.5 in) in size.[1] Whale shark eggs typically hatch
within the mother. At 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) and up to 17.8 cm Ã 14 cm (7.0 in
Ã 5.5 in), the ostrich egg is the largest egg of any living bird,[2] though
the extinct elephant_bird and some dinosaurs laid larger eggs. The bee
hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg, which weighs half of a gram
(around 0.02 oz). Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish, amphibians,
insects, and other invertebrates can be even smaller.
Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed
"spores," or in spermatophytes "seeds," or in gametophytes "egg cells".

**** Fish and amphibian eggs ****

Salmon fry hatching. The larva has grown around the remains of the yolk and the
remains of the soft, transparent egg are discarded.
The most common reproductive strategy for fish is known as oviparity, in which
the female lays undeveloped eggs that are externally fertilized by a male.
Typically large numbers of eggs are laid at one time (an adult female cod can
produce 4â6 million eggs in one spawning) and the eggs are then left to
develop without parental care. When the larvae hatch from the egg, they often
carry the remains of the yolk in a yolk sac which continues to nourish the
larvae for a few days as they learn how to swim. Once the yolk is consumed,
there is a critical point after which they must learn how to hunt and feed or
they will die.
A few fish, notably the rays and most sharks use ovoviviparity in which the
eggs are fertilized and develop internally. However the larvae still grow
inside the egg consuming the egg's yolk and without any direct nourishment from
the mother. The mother then gives birth to relatively mature young. In certain
instances, the physically most developed offspring will devour its smaller
siblings for further nutrition while still within the mother's body. This is
known as intrauterine_cannibalism.
In certain scenarios, some fish such as the hammerhead_shark and reef_shark are
viviparous, with the egg being fertilized and developed internally, but with
the mother also providing direct nourishment.
The eggs of fish and amphibians are jellylike. Cartilagenous fish (sharks,
skates, rays, chimaeras) eggs are fertilized internally and exhibit a wide
variety of both internal and external embryonic development. Most fish species
spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, typically with the male inseminating
the eggs after the female lays them. These eggs do not have a shell and would
dry out in the air. Even air-breathing amphibians lay their eggs in water, or
in protective foam as with the Coast foam-nest treefrog, Chiromantis
xerampelina.
**** Bird eggs ****
Main article: Bird_egg
Bird eggs are laid by females and incubated for a time that varies according to
the species; a single young hatches from each egg. Average clutch_sizes range
from one (as in condors) to about 17 (the grey_partridge). Some birds lay eggs
even when not fertilized (e.g. hens); it is not uncommon for pet owners to find
their lone bird nesting on a clutch of unfertilized eggs, which are sometimes
called wind-eggs.
*** Colors ***
Guillemot eggs
The default color of vertebrate eggs is the white of the calcium_carbonate from
which the shells are made, but some birds, mainly passerines, produce colored
eggs. The pigment biliverdin and its zinc chelate give a green or blue ground
color, and protoporphyrin produces reds and browns as a ground color or as
spotting.
Non-passerines typically have white eggs, except in some ground-nesting groups
such as the Charadriiformes, sandgrouse and nightjars, where camouflage is
necessary, and some parasitic cuckoos which have to match the passerine host's
egg. Most passerines, in contrast, lay colored eggs, even if there is no need
of cryptic colors.
However some have suggested that the protoporphyrin markings on passerine eggs
actually act to reduce brittleness by acting as a solid state lubricant.[10] If
there is insufficient calcium available in the local soil, the egg shell may be
thin, especially in a circle around the broad end. Protoporphyrin speckling
compensates for this, and increases inversely to the amount of calcium in the
soil.[11]
For the same reason, later eggs in a clutch are more spotted than early ones as
the female's store of calcium is depleted.
The color of individual eggs is also genetically influenced, and appears to be
inherited through the mother only, suggesting that the gene responsible for
pigmentation is on the sex determining W_chromosome (female birds are WZ, males
ZZ).
It used to be thought that color was applied to the shell immediately before
laying, but this research shows that coloration is an integral part of the
development of the shell, with the same protein responsible for depositing
calcium carbonate, or protoporphyrins when there is a lack of that mineral.
In species such as the common_guillemot, which nest in large groups, each
female's eggs have very different markings, making it easier for females to
identify their own eggs on the crowded cliff ledges on which they breed.
*** Shell ***
Bird eggshells are diverse. For example:
    * cormorant eggs are rough and chalky
    * tinamou eggs are shiny
    * duck eggs are oily and waterproof
    * cassowary eggs are heavily pitted
Tiny pores in bird eggshells allow the embryo to breathe. The domestic_hen's
egg has around 7000 pores.[12]
Some bird eggshells have a coating of vaterite spherules, which is a rare
polymorph of calcium carbonate. In Greater_Ani Crotophaga major this vaterite
coating is thought to act as a shock absorber, protecting the calcite shell
from fracture during incubation, such as colliding with other eggs in the nest.
[13]
*** Shape ***
A 3-D model of an egg
Most bird eggs have an oval_shape, with one end rounded and the other more
pointed. This shape results from the egg being forced through the oviduct.
Muscles contract the oviduct behind the egg, pushing it forward. The egg's wall
is still shapeable, and the pointed end develops at the back. Long, pointy eggs
are an incidental consequence of having a streamlined body typical of birds
with strong flying abilities; flight narrows the oviduct, which changes the
type of egg a bird can lay.[14] Cliff-nesting birds often have highly conical
eggs. They are less likely to roll off, tending instead to roll around in a
tight circle; this trait is likely to have arisen due to evolution via natural
selection. In contrast, many hole-nesting birds have nearly spherical eggs.[15]
*** Predation ***
Many animals feed on eggs. For example, principal predators of the black
oystercatcher's eggs include raccoons, skunks, mink, river and sea otters,
gulls, crows and foxes. The stoat (Mustela erminea) and long-tailed_weasel (M.
frenata) steal ducks' eggs. Snakes of the genera Dasypeltis and Elachistodon
specialize in eating eggs.
Brood_parasitism occurs in birds when one species lays its eggs in the nest of
another. In some cases, the host's eggs are removed or eaten by the female, or
expelled by her chick. Brood parasites include the cowbirds and many Old World
cuckoos.

**** Amniote eggs and embryos ****
Turtle eggs in a nest dug by a female common snapping turtle (Chelydra
serpentina)
Like amphibians, amniotes are air-breathing vertebrates, but they have complex
eggs or embryos, including an amniotic_membrane. Amniotes include reptiles
(including dinosaurs and their descendants, birds) and mammals.
Reptile eggs are often rubbery and are always initially white. They are able to
survive in the air. Often the sex of the developing embryo is determined by the
temperature of the surroundings, with cooler temperatures favouring males. Not
all reptiles lay eggs; some are viviparous ("live birth").
Dinosaurs laid eggs, some of which have been preserved as petrified fossils.
Among mammals, early extinct species laid eggs, as do platypuses and echidnas
(spiny anteaters). Platypuses and two genera of echidna are Australian
monotremes. Marsupial and placental mammals do not lay eggs, but their unborn
young do have the complex tissues that identify amniotes.
**** Mammalian eggs ****
The eggs of the egg-laying mammals (the platypus and the echidnas) are
macrolecithal eggs very much like those of reptiles. The eggs of marsupials are
likewise macrolecithal, but rather small, and develop inside the body of the
female, but do not form a placenta. The young are born at a very early stage,
and can be classified as a "larva" in the biological sense.[16]
In placental_mammals, the egg itself is void of yolk, but develops an umbilical
cord from structures that in reptiles would form the yolk sac. Receiving
nutrients from the mother, the fetus completes the development while inside the
uterus.
**** Invertebrate eggs ****

Eggs are common among invertebrates, including insects, spiders, mollusks, and
crustaceans.
***** Evolution and structure *****
All sexually reproducing life, including both plants and animals, produces
gametes. The male gamete cell, sperm, is usually motile whereas the female
gamete cell, the ovum, is generally larger and sessile. The male and female
gametes combine to produce the zygote cell. In multicellular organisms the
zygote subsequently divides in an organised manner into smaller more
specialised cells, so that this new individual develops into an embryo. In most
animals the embryo is the sessile initial stage of the individual life cycle,
and is followed by the emergence (that is, the hatching) of a motile stage. The
zygote or the ovum itself or the sessile organic vessel containing the
developing embryo may be called the egg.
A recent proposal suggests that the phylotypic animal body_plans originated in
cell aggregates before the existence of an egg stage of development. Eggs, in
this view, were later evolutionary innovations, selected for their role in
ensuring genetic uniformity among the cells of incipient multicellular
organisms.[17]
***** Scientific classifications *****
Scientists often classify animal reproduction according to the degree of
development that occurs before the new individuals are expelled from the adult
body, and by the yolk which the egg provides to nourish the embryo.
**** Egg size and yolk ****
Vertebrate eggs can be classified by the relative amount of yolk. Simple eggs
with little yolk are called microlecithal, medium-sized eggs with some yolk are
called mesolecithal, and large eggs with a large concentrated yolk are called
macrolecithal.[7] This classification of eggs is based on the eggs of
chordates, though the basic principle extends to the whole animal_kingdom.
*** Microlecithal ***
Microlecithal eggs from the roundworm Toxocara
Microlecithal eggs from the flatworm Paragonimus_westermani
Small eggs with little yolk are called microlecithal. The yolk is evenly
distributed, so the cleavage of the egg cell cuts through and divides the egg
into cells of fairly similar sizes. In sponges and cnidarians the dividing eggs
develop directly into a simple larva, rather like a morula with cilia. In
cnidarians, this stage is called the planula, and either develops directly into
the adult animals or forms new adult individuals through a process of budding.
[18]
Microlecithal eggs require minimal yolk mass. Such eggs are found in flatworms,
roundworms, annelids, bivalves, echinoderms, the lancelet and in most marine
arthropods.[19] In anatomically simple animals, such as cnidarians and
flatworms, the fetal development can be quite short, and even microlecithal
eggs can undergo direct development. These small eggs can be produced in large
numbers. In animals with high egg mortality, microlecithal eggs are the norm,
as in bivalves and marine arthropods. However, the latter are more complex
anatomically than e.g. flatworms, and the small microlecithal eggs do not allow
full development. Instead, the eggs hatch into larvae, which may be markedly
different from the adult animal.
In placental mammals, where the embryo is nourished by the mother throughout
the whole fetal period, the egg is reduced in size to essentially a naked egg
cell.
*** Mesolecithal ***
Frogspawn is mesolecithal.
Mesolecithal eggs have comparatively more yolk than the microlecithal eggs. The
yolk is concentrated in one part of the egg (the vegetal pole), with the cell
nucleus and most of the cytoplasm in the other (the animal pole). The cell
cleavage is uneven, and mainly concentrated in the cytoplasma-rich animal pole.
[3]
The larger yolk content of the mesolecithal eggs allows for a longer fetal
development. Comparatively anatomically simple animals will be able to go
through the full development and leave the egg in a form reminiscent of the
adult animal. This is the situation found in hagfish and some snails.[4][19]
Animals with smaller size eggs or more advanced anatomy will still have a
distinct larval stage, though the larva will be basically similar to the adult
animal, as in lampreys, coelacanth and the salamanders.[3]
*** Macrolecithal ***
A baby tortoise begins to emerge "fully developed" from its macrolecithal egg.
Eggs with a large yolk are called macrolecithal. The eggs are usually few in
number, and the embryos have enough food to go through full fetal development
in most groups.[7] Macrolecithal eggs are only found in selected
representatives of two groups: Cephalopods and vertebrates.[7][20]
Macrolecithal eggs go through a different type of development than other eggs.
Due to the large size of the yolk, the cell division can not split up the yolk
mass. The fetus instead develops as a plate-like structure on top of the yolk
mass, and only envelopes it at a later stage.[7] A portion of the yolk mass is
still present as an external or semi-external yolk_sac at hatching in many
groups. This form of fetal development is common in bony_fish, even though
their eggs can be quite small. Despite their macrolecithal structure, the small
size of the eggs does not allow for direct development, and the eggs hatch to a
larval stage ("fry"). In terrestrial animals with macrolecithal eggs, the large
volume to surface ratio necessitates structures to aid in transport of oxygen
and carbon dioxide, and for storage of waste products so that the embryo does
not suffocate or get poisoned from its own waste while inside the egg, see
amniote.[9]
In addition to bony fish and cephalopods, macrolecithal eggs are found in
cartilaginous_fish, reptiles, birds and monotreme mammals.[3] The eggs of the
coelacanths can reach a size of 9 cm in diameter, and the young go through full
development while in the uterus, living on the copious yolk.[21]
**** Egg-laying reproduction ****
Animals are commonly classified by their manner of reproduction, at the most
general level distinguishing egg-laying (Latin. oviparous) from live-bearing
(Latin. viviparous).
These classifications are divided into more detail according to the development
that occurs before the offspring are expelled from the adult's body.
Traditionally:[22]
    * Ovuliparity means the female spawns unfertilized eggs (ova), which must
      then be externally fertilised. Ovuliparity is typical of bony_fish,
      anurans, echinoderms, bivalves and cnidarians. Most aquatic organisms are
      ovuliparous. The term is derived from the diminiutive meaning "little
      egg".
    * Oviparity is where fertilisation occurs internally and so the eggs laid
      by the female are zygotes (or newly developing embryos), often with
      important outer tissues added (for example, in a chicken egg, no part
      outside of the yolk originates with the zygote). Oviparity is typical of
      birds, reptiles, some cartilaginous fish and most arthropods. Terrestrial
      organisms are typically oviparous, with egg-casings that resist
      evaporation of moisture.
    * Ovo-viviparity is where the zygote is retained in the adultâs body but
      there are no trophic (feeding) interactions. That is, the embryo still
      obtains all of its nutrients from inside the egg. Most live-bearing fish,
      amphibians or reptiles are actually ovoviviparous. Examples include the
      reptile Anguis_fragilis, the sea horse (where zygotes are retained in the
      maleâs ventral "marsupium"), and the frogs Rhinoderma darwinii (where
      the eggs develop in the vocal sac) and Rheobatrachus (where the eggs
      develop in the stomach).
    * Histotrophic viviparity means embryos develop in the femaleâs oviducts
      but obtain nutrients by consuming other ova, zygotes or sibling embryos
      (oophagy or adelphophagy). This intra-uterine_cannibalism occurs in some
      sharks and in the black salamander Salamandra atra. Marsupials excrete a
      "uterine milk" supplementing the nourishment from the yolk sak.[23]
    * Hemotrophic viviparity is where nutrients are provided from the female's
      blood through a designated organ. This most commonly occurs through a
      placenta, found in most_mammals. Similar structures are found in some
      sharks and in the lizard Pseudomoia pagenstecheri.[24][25] In some hylid
      frogs, the embryo is fed by the mother through specialized gills.[26]
The term hemotropic derives from the Latin for blood-feeding, contrasted with
histotrophic for tissue-feeding.[27]
***** Human use *****
**** Food ****
Main article: Egg_as_food
Eggs laid by many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, and
fish, have probably been eaten by mankind for millennia. Popular choices for
egg consumption are chicken, duck, roe, and caviar, but by a wide margin the
egg most often humanly consumed is the chicken egg, typically unfertilized.
*** Eggs and Kashrut ***
See also: Kashrut_Â§ Pareve_foods, and Kosher_foods_Â§ Eggs
According to the Kashrut, that is the set of Jewish dietary_laws, kosher food
may be consumed according to halakha (Jewish law). Kosher meat and milk (or
derivatives) cannot be mixed (Deuteronomy_14:21) or stored together. Eggs are
considered pareve (neither meat nor dairy) despite being an animal product and
can be mixed with either milk or kosher meat. Mayonnaise, for instance, is
usually marked "pareve" despite by definition containing egg.[28]
**** Vaccine manufacture ****
Many vaccines for infectious diseases are produced in fertile chicken eggs. The
basis of this technology was the discovery in 1931 by Alice_Miles_Woodruff and
Ernest_William_Goodpasture at Vanderbilt_University that the rickettsia and
viruses that cause a variety of diseases will grow in chicken embryos. This
enabled the development of vaccines against influenza, chicken_pox, smallpox,
yellow_fever, typhus, Rocky_mountain_spotted_fever and other diseases.
**** Culture ****
The egg is a symbol of new life and rebirth in many cultures around the world.
Christians view Easter eggs as symbolic of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[29] A popular Easter tradition in some parts of the world is the decoration of
hard-boiled eggs (usually by dyeing, but often by spray-painting). Adults often
hide the eggs for children to find, an activity known as an Easter egg hunt. A
similar tradition of egg painting exists in areas of the world influenced by
the culture of Persia. Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year
tradition (called Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and
sets them together in a bowl. The tradition of a dancing_egg is held during the
feast of Corpus Christi in Barcelona and other Catalan cities since the 16th
century. It consists of an emptied egg, positioned over the water jet from a
fountain, which starts turning without falling.[30]
Although a food item, eggs are sometimes thrown at houses, cars, or people.
This act, known commonly as "egging" in the various English-speaking countries,
is a minor form of vandalism and, therefore, usually a criminal offense and is
capable of damaging property (egg whites can degrade certain types of vehicle
paint) as well as causing serious eye injury. On Halloween, for example, trick
or treaters have been known to throw eggs (and sometimes flour) at property or
people from whom they received nothing.[citation_needed] Eggs are also often
thrown in protests, as they are inexpensive and nonlethal, yet very messy when
broken.[31]
***** Collecting *****
Egg collecting was a popular hobby in various contexts, including among the
first Australians favored this practice. Traditionally, the embryo would be
removed before a collector stored the egg shell.[32]
Collecting eggs of wild birds is now banned by many countries and regions in
consideration of the threaten to rare species. In the United Kingdom, the
practice is prohibited by the Protection_of_Birds_Act_1954 and Wildlife_and
Countryside_Act_1981.[33] On the other hand, ongoing underground trading is
becoming a serious issue.[34]
Since the protection of wild bird eggs was regulated, early collections have
come to the museums as curiosities. For example, the Australian Museum hosts a
collection of about 20,000 registered clutches of eggs,[35] and the collection
in Western Australia Museum has been archived in a gallery.[36] Scientists
regard egg collections as a good natural-history data, as the details recorded
in the collectors' notes have helped them to understand birds' nesting
behaviors.[37]
