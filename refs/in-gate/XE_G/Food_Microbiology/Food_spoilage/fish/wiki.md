Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.
They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.
Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous
and bony_fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged
within lobe-finned_fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However,
traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e.,
the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the
same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as
a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in
systematic_biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including
tetrapods.[1][2] The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a
typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.
The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied
chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked
a true_spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile
than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the
Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the
Paleozoic developed external_armor that protected them from predators. The
first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as
sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of
arthropods.
Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to
vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers
like white_shark and tuna can hold a higher core_temperature.[3][4]
Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of
acoustic communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the
transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another.
The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often
used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.[5] The
sounds emitted by fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved.
They can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the
skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating
specialized organs such as the swimbladder.[6]
Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all
aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to
the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and
anglerfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of
the ocean. With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species
diversity than any other group of vertebrates.[7][8]
Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as_food.
Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild_fisheries (see fishing) or
farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also
caught by recreational_fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and
exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have had a role in culture through the ages,
serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and
movies.

***** Evolution *****
Main article: Evolution_of_fish
[Drawing_of_animal_with_large_mouth,_long_tail,_very_small_dorsal_fins,_and
pectoral_fins_that_attach_towards_the_bottom_of_the_body,_resembling_lizard
legs_in_scale_and_development.[9]]
Dunkleosteus was a gigantic, 10-metre (33 ft) long prehistoric_fish of class
Placodermi.
Fish do not represent a monophyletic group, and therefore the "evolution of
fish" is not studied as a single event.[10]
Early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small, jawless,
armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct.
An extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first
jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may
indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed_mouth. It is unclear if the
advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a
combination of factors.
Fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like sea_squirt, whose
larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish
may have kept_the_larval_form_into_adulthood (as some sea squirts do today),
although perhaps the reverse is the case.
**** Taxonomy ****
Fish are a paraphyletic group: that is, any clade containing all fish also
contains the tetrapods, which are not fish. For this reason, groups such as the
class Pisces seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal
classifications.
Leedsichthys (left), of the subclass Actinopterygii, is the largest known fish,
with estimates in 2005 putting its maximum size at 16 metres (52 ft).
Traditional classification divides fish into three extant classes, and with
extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree, sometimes as their own
classes:[11][12]
    * Class Agnatha (jawless fish)
          o Subclass Cyclostomata (hagfish and lampreys)
          o Subclass Ostracodermi (armoured jawless fish) â 
    * Class Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish)
          o Subclass Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays)
          o Subclass Holocephali (chimaeras and extinct relatives)
    * Class Placodermi (armoured fish) â 
    * Class Acanthodii ("spiny sharks", sometimes classified under bony
      fishes)â 
    * Class Osteichthyes (bony fish)
          o Subclass Actinopterygii (ray finned fishes)
          o Subclass Sarcopterygii (fleshy finned fishes, ancestors of
            tetrapods)
The above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in non-specialist and
general works. Many of the above groups are paraphyletic, in that they have
given rise to successive groups: Agnathans are ancestral to Chondrichthyes, who
again have given rise to Acanthodiians, the ancestors of Osteichthyes. With the
arrival of phylogenetic_nomenclature, the fishes has been split up into a more
detailed scheme, with the following major groups:
    * Class Myxini (hagfish)
    * Class Pteraspidomorphi â  (early jawless fish)
    * Class Thelodonti â 
    * Class Anaspida â 
    * Class Petromyzontida_or_Hyperoartia
          o Petromyzontidae (lampreys)
    * Class Conodonta (conodonts) â 
    * Class Cephalaspidomorphi â  (early jawless fish)
          o (unranked) Galeaspida â 
          o (unranked) Pituriaspida â 
          o (unranked) Osteostraci â 
    * Infraphylum Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates)
          o Class Placodermi â  (armoured fish)
          o Class Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish)
          o Class Acanthodii â  (spiny sharks)
          o Superclass Osteichthyes (bony fish)
                # Class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish)
                      # Subclass Chondrostei
                            # Order Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and
                              paddlefishes)
                            # Order Polypteriformes (reedfishes and bichirs).
                      # Subclass Neopterygii
                            # Infraclass Holostei (gars and bowfins)
                            # Infraclass Teleostei (many orders of common fish)
                # Class Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish)
                      # Subclass Actinistia (coelacanths)
                      # Subclass Dipnoi (lungfish)
â  â indicates extinct taxon
Some palaeontologists contend that because Conodonta are chordates, they are
primitive fish. For a fuller treatment of this taxonomy, see the vertebrate
article.
The position of hagfish in the phylum Chordata is not settled. Phylogenetic
research in 1998 and 1999 supported the idea that the hagfish and the lampreys
form a natural group, the Cyclostomata, that is a sister group of the
Gnathostomata.[13][14]
The various fish groups account for more than half of vertebrate species. There
are almost 28,000 known extant species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish,
with 970 sharks,_rays,_and_chimeras and about 108 hagfish and lampreys.[15] A
third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to
smallest, these families are Cyprinidae, Gobiidae, Cichlidae, Characidae,
Loricariidae, Balitoridae, Serranidae, Labridae, and Scorpaenidae. About 64
families are monotypic, containing only one species. The final total of extant
species may grow to exceed 32,500.[16]

A relative of the seahorses, the leafy_seadragon's appendages allow it to

The psychedelic mandarin_dragonet is one of only two animal species known to
have blue colouring because of cellular pigment.[17]
The term "fish" most precisely describes any non-tetrapod craniate (i.e. an
animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone) that has gills throughout
life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins.[18] Unlike groupings
such as birds or mammals, fish are not a single clade but a paraphyletic
collection of taxa, including hagfishes, lampreys, sharks_and_rays, ray-finned
fish, coelacanths, and lungfish.[19][20] Indeed, lungfish and coelacanths are
closer relatives of tetrapods (such as mammals, birds, amphibians, etc.) than
of other fish such as ray-finned_fish or sharks, so the last_common_ancestor of
all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods. As paraphyletic groups are no longer
recognised in modern systematic_biology, the use of the term "fish" as a
biological group must be avoided.
Many types of aquatic_animals commonly referred to as "fish" are not fish in
the sense given above; examples include shellfish, cuttlefish, starfish,
crayfish and jellyfish. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a
distinction â sixteenth century natural historians classified also seals,
whales, amphibians, crocodiles, even hippopotamuses, as well as a host of
aquatic invertebrates, as fish.[21] However, according to the definition above,
all mammals, including cetaceans like whales and dolphins, are not fish. In
some contexts, especially in aquaculture, the true fish are referred to as
finfish (or fin fish) to distinguish them from these other animals.
A typical fish is ectothermic, has a streamlined body for rapid swimming,
extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to
breathe atmospheric oxygen, has two sets of paired fins, usually one or two
(rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin
that is usually covered with scales, and lays eggs.
Each criterion has exceptions. Tuna, swordfish, and some species of sharks show
some_warm-blooded_adaptations â they can heat their bodies significantly
above ambient water temperature.[19] Streamlining and swimming performance
varies from fish such as tuna, salmon, and jacks that can cover 10â20 body-
lengths per second to species such as eels and rays that swim no more than 0.5
body-lengths per second.[22] Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from
the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures.
Lungfish have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, gouramis have a
structure called the labyrinth_organ that performs a similar function, while
many catfish, such as Corydoras extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach.
[23] Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering
such seemingly un-fishlike forms as seahorses, pufferfish, anglerfish, and
gulpers. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in moray_eels), or
covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as placoid
(typical of sharks and rays), cosmoid (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), ganoid
(various fossil fish but also living gars and bichirs), cycloid, and ctenoid
(these last two are found on most bony_fish).[24] There are even fish that live
mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water.[25] Mudskippers feed and
interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their
burrows.[26] A single, undescribed_species of Phreatobius, has been called a
true "land fish" as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged
leaf_litter.[27][28] Many species live in underground_lakes, underground_rivers
or aquifers and are popularly known as cavefish.[29]
Fish range in size from the huge 16-metre (52 ft) whale_shark to the tiny 8-
millimetre (0.3 in) stout_infantfish.
Fish species diversity is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and
freshwater ecosystems. Coral_reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute the center of
diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most
diverse in large river_basins of tropical_rainforests, especially the Amazon,
Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical
freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical_fishes represent about 10% of all
vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin,
such as CantÃ£o_State_Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur
in all of Europe.[30]

**** Respiration ****
See also: Aquatic_respiration
*** Gills ***
Most fish exchange gases using gills on either side of the pharynx. Gills
consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a
capillary network that provides a large surface_area for exchanging oxygen and
carbon_dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their
mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in
the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent_exchange. The gills
push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx.
Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However,
bony_fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden
beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.
Juvenile bichirs have external gills, a very primitive feature that they share
with larval amphibians.
*** Air breathing ***
[Photo_of_fish_head_split_in_half_longitudinally_with_gill_filaments_crossing
from_top_to_bottom]
Tuna gills inside the head. The fish head is oriented snout-downwards, with the
view looking towards the mouth.
Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended periods.
Amphibious_fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up
to several days,[dubious  – discuss] or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen
depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The
skin of anguillid_eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal_cavity of the
electric_eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae,
Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts.
[31] Lungfish, with the exception of the Australian_lungfish, and bichirs have
paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air
through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have
a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras,
and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by
absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have
evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air.
Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth_organ above the
gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling
labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and
the Clariidae catfish family.
Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally
variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline.
Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly
suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water
that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish
are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state
of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.
Air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative
air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African_lungfish, must
breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as
the catfish Hypostomus_plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will
otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are
facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the
surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.[31]
**** Circulation ****
Didactic_model of a fish heart
Fish have a closed-loop_circulatory_system. The heart pumps the blood in a
single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four
parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.[32] The first part is
the sinus_venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins
before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large
muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to
the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular
chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus_arteriosus, a
large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the
aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.
**** Digestion ****
Jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other
organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the
esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish,
processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric_caeca, which secrete
digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas
add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive
tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient
absorption.
**** Excretion ****
As with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as
ammonia. Some of the wastes diffuse through the gills. Blood wastes are
filtered by the kidneys.
Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of osmosis. Their kidneys return
water to the body. The reverse happens in freshwater_fish: they tend to gain
water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish
have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move
from freshwater to saltwater.
**** Scales ****
Main article: Fish_scale
The scales of fish originate from the mesoderm (skin); they may be similar in
structure to teeth.
**** Sensory and nervous system ****
[Anatomical_diagram_showing_the_pairs_of_olfactory,_telencephalon,_and_optic
lobes,_followed_by_the_cerebellum_and_the_mylencephalon]
Dorsal view of the brain of the rainbow_trout
*** Central nervous system ***
Fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with
other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized
bird or mammal.[33] However, some fish have relatively large brains, most
notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to
body weight as birds and marsupials.[34]
Fish brains are divided into several regions. At the front are the olfactory
lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils
via the two olfactory_nerves.[33] The olfactory lobes are very large in fish
that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the
olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to
the cerebrum in higher_vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned
mostly with olfaction.[33] Together these structures form the forebrain.
Connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram,
this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The
diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis.[33]
The pineal_body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light,
maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.[33]
The midbrain (or mesencephalon) contains the two optic_lobes. These are very
large in species that hunt by sight, such as rainbow_trout and cichlids.[33]
The hindbrain (or metencephalon) is particularly involved in swimming and
balance.[33] The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the
biggest part of the brain.[33] Hagfish and lampreys have relatively small
cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in
their electrical_sense.[33]
The brain stem (or myelencephalon) is the brain's posterior.[33] As well as
controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem
governs respiration and osmoregulation.[33]
*** Sense organs ***
Most fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have
color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see vision_in_fishes). Many
fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of
taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well.
Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral_line_system, which
detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish
and prey.[35] Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae_of
Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.
[36] Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can
produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social
communication.
Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on
multiple landmarks or symbols. Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess
spatial memory and visual discrimination.[37]
** Vision **
Main article: Vision_in_fishes
Vision is an important sensory_system for most species of fish. Fish eyes are
similar to those of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a
more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for
scotopic and photopic_vision), and most species have colour_vision. Some fish
can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized_light. Amongst jawless_fish, the
lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots.
[38] Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep
sea_fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.
** Hearing **
See also: Sensory_systems_in_fish_Â§ Hearing
Hearing is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Fish sense
sound using their lateral_lines and their ears.
*** Cognition ***
Further information: Fish_intelligence
New research has expanded preconceptions about the cognitive capacities of
fish. For example, manta_rays have exhibited behavior linked to self-awareness
in mirror_test cases. Placed in front of a mirror, individual rays engaged in
contingency testing, that is, repetitive behavior aiming to check whether their
reflection's behavior mimics their body movement.[39]
Wrasses have also passed the mirror test in a 2018 scientific study.[40][41].
Cases of tool use have also been noticed, notably in the Choerodon family, in
archerfish and Atlantic_cod.[42]
*** Capacity for pain ***
Further information: Pain_in_fish
Experiments done by William Tavolga provide evidence that fish have pain and
fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, toadfish grunted when
electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an
electrode.[43]
In 2003, Scottish scientists at the University_of_Edinburgh and the Roslin
Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with
pain in other animals. Bee venom and acetic_acid injected into the lips
resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides
and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to
relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do.[44][45] Neurons fired in a
pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.[45]
Professor James D. Rose of the University_of_Wyoming claimed the study was
flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess "conscious awareness,
particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours".[46] Rose
argues that since fish brains are so different from human brains, fish are
probably not conscious in the manner humans are, so that reactions similar to
human reactions to pain instead have other causes. Rose had published a study a
year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a
neocortex.[47] However, animal behaviorist Temple_Grandin argues that fish
could still have consciousness without a neocortex because "different species
can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions."
[45]
Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible suffering of fish
caused by angling. Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types
of fishing, and the British RSPCA now formally prosecutes individuals who are
cruel to fish.[48]
**** Muscular system ****

shaped_section_connected_by_a_much_thinner_element]
Swim bladder of a rudd (Scardinius_erythrophthalmus)
Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side
of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the
body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the
water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's
fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface
area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount
of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must
compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an
internal organ called a swim_bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through
manipulation of gases.
*** Endothermy ***
Although most fish are exclusively ectothermic, there are exceptions. The only
known bony fishes (infraclass Teleostei) that exhibit endothermy are in the
suborder Scombroidei â which includes the billfishes, tunas, and the
butterfly_kingfish, a basal species of mackerel[49] â and also the opah. The
opah, a lampriform, was demonstrated in 2015 to utilize "whole-body
endothermy", generating heat with its swimming muscles to warm its body while
countercurrent exchange (as in respiration) minimizes heat loss.[50] It is able
to actively hunt prey such as squid and swim for long distances due to the
ability to warm its entire body, including its heart,[51] which is a trait
typically found in only mammals and birds (in the form of homeothermy). In the
cartilaginous fishes (class Chondrichthyes), sharks of the families Lamnidae
(porbeagle, mackerel, salmon, and great white sharks) and Alopiidae (thresher
sharks) exhibit endothermy. The degree of endothermy varies from the
billfishes, which warm only their eyes and brain, to the bluefin_tuna and the
porbeagle_shark, which maintain body temperatures in excess of 20 Â°C (68 Â°F)
above ambient water temperatures.[49]
Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such
as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous_system
processing, and higher rates of digestion.
**** Reproductive system ****
Further information: Fish_reproduction and Spawn_(biology)
Organs: 1. Liver, 2. Gas_bladder, 3. Roe, 4. Pyloric caeca, 5. Stomach, 6.
Intestine
Fish reproductive organs include testicles and ovaries. In most species, gonads
are paired organs of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.[52]
There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive
fitness.
In terms of spermatogonia distribution, the structure of teleosts testes has
two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the seminiferous
tubules, while in atherinomorph fish they are confined to the distal portion of
these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic spermatogenesis in
relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous
tubules lumen.[52]
Fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or
cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the
coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are
eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which
they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed
to the exterior through the oviduct.[53] Gymnovaries are the primitive
condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize
most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct.[52]
Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids and a few other teleosts.
Oogonia development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the
determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and
fertilization processes. Changes in the nucleus, ooplasm, and the surrounding
layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.[52]
Postovulatory follicles are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not
have endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly
reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A
degenerative process called follicular_atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes
not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in
other development stages.[52]
Some fish, like the California_sheephead, are hermaphrodites, having both
testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in
hamlets, have them simultaneously.
Over 97% of all known fish are oviparous,[54] that is, the eggs develop outside
the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include salmon, goldfish,
cichlids, tuna, and eels. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes
place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their
gametes into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice
internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of intromittent_organ to
deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the
oviparous sharks, such as the horn_shark, and oviparous rays, such as skates.
In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known
as claspers.
Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the
open water column. The eggs have an average diameter of 1 millimetre
(0.039 in).
    * Egg of lamprey
    * Egg of catshark (mermaids'_purse)
    * Egg of bullhead_shark
    * Egg of chimaera
    * Ovary of fish (CorumbatÃ¡)
The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larvae. They are usually
poorly formed, carry a large yolk_sac (for nourishment), and are very different
in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous
fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow
and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become
juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to
feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate
zooplankton density, starving many larvae.
In ovoviviparous fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal
fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother,
depending instead on the yolk. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar
examples of ovoviviparous fish include guppies, angel_sharks, and coelacanths.
Some species of fish are viviparous. In such species the mother retains the
eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure
analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply
with that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches,
splitfins, and lemon_shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the
developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been
observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin_mako and porbeagle, but
is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus
ebrardtii.[55] Intrauterine_cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of
vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This
behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey_nurse
shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.[55]
Aquarists commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as livebearers.
***** Acoustic communication in fish *****
Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals
from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a
means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding,
aggression or courtship behaviour.[5] The sounds emitted can vary depending on
the species and stimulus involved. Fish can produce either stridulatory sounds
by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory
sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.[6]
**** Stridulatory sound producing mechanisms ****
French grunts â Haemulon flavolineatum
There are some species of fish that can produce sounds by rubbing or grinding
their bones together. These noises produced by bone-on-bone interactions are
known as 'stridulatory sounds'.[6]
An example of this is seen in Haemulon_flavolineatum, a species commonly
referred to as the 'French grunt fish', as it produces a grunting noise by
grinding its teeth together.[6] This behaviour is most pronounced when the H.
flavolineatum is in distress situations.[6] The grunts produced by this species
of fishes generate a frequency of approximately 700 Hz, and last approximately
47 milliseconds.[6] The H._flavolineatum does not emit sounds with frequencies
greater than 1000 Hz, and does not detect sounds that have frequencies greater
than 1050 Hz.[6]
In a study conducted by Oliveira et al. (2014), the longsnout seahorse,
Hippocampus_reidi, was recorded producing two different categories of sounds;
âclicksâ and âgrowlsâ. The sounds emitted by the H._reidi are
accomplished by rubbing their coronet bone across the grooved section of their
neurocranium.[56] âClickingâ sounds were found to be primarily produced
during courtship and feeding, and the frequencies of clicks were within the
range of 50 Hz-800 Hz.[57] The frequencies were noted to be on the higher end
of the range during spawning periods, when the female and male fishes were less
than fifteen centimeters apart.[57] Growl sounds were produced when the H.
reidi encountered stressful situations, such as handling by researchers.[57]
The âgrowlâ sounds consist of a series of sound pulses and are emitted
simultaneously with body vibrations.[57]
**** Non-stridulatory sound producing mechanisms ****
Oyster toadfish
Some fish species create noise by engaging specialized muscles that contract
and cause swimbladder vibrations.
Oyster_toadfish produce loud grunting sounds by contracting muscles located
along the sides of their swim bladder, known as sonic muscles[58] Female and
male toadfishes emit short-duration grunts, often as a fright response.[59] In
addition to short-duration grunts, male toadfishes produce âboat whistle
callsâ.[60] These calls are longer in duration, lower in frequency, and are
primarily used to attract mates.[60] The sounds emitted by the O. tao have
frequency range of 140 Hz to 260 Hz.[60] The frequencies of the calls depend on
the rate at which the sonic muscles contract.[61][58]
The red drum, Sciaenops_ocellatus, produces drumming sounds by vibrating its
swimbladder.[62] Vibrations are caused by the rapid contraction of sonic
muscles that surround the dorsal aspect of the swimbladder.[62] These
vibrations result in repeated sounds with frequencies that range from 100 to
>200 Hz.[62] The S._Ocellatus can produce different calls depending on the
stimuli involved.[62] The sounds created in courtship situations are different
from those made during distressing events such as predatorial attacks.[62]
Unlike the males of the S._Ocellatus species, the females of this species don't
produce sounds and lack sound-producing (sonic) muscles.[62]
***** Diseases *****
Main article: Fish_diseases_and_parasites
Like other animals, fish suffer from diseases and parasites. To prevent disease
they have a variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and
scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and
inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish
can develop an inflammatory_response that increases blood flow to the infected
region and delivers white_blood_cells that attempt to destroy pathogens.
Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's
body, i.e., an immune_response.[63] In recent years, vaccines have become
widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example
furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi_herpes_virus in koi.[64][65]
Some species use cleaner_fish to remove external parasites. The best known of
these are the Bluestreak_cleaner_wrasses of the genus Labroides found on coral
reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans. These small fish maintain so-called
"cleaning stations" where other fish congregate and perform specific movements
to attract the attention of the cleaners.[66] Cleaning behaviors have been
observed in a number of fish groups, including an interesting case between two
cichlids of the same genus, Etroplus_maculatus, the cleaner, and the much
larger Etroplus suratensis.[67]
**** Immune system ****
Immune organs vary by type of fish.[68] In the jawless_fish (lampreys and
hagfish), true lymphoid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of
lymphoid_tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example,
erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma_cells are produced in the anterior kidney
(or pronephros) and some areas of the gut (where granulocytes mature.) They
resemble primitive bone_marrow in hagfish. Cartilaginous_fish (sharks and rays)
have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are
unique to Chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to
mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's_organ within the walls
of their esophagus, and a spiral_valve in their intestine. These organs house
typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also
possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most
important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages
develop and are stored. Chondrostean fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs)
possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is
associated with the meninges (membranes surrounding the central nervous
system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains
lymphocytes, reticular_cells and a small number of macrophages. The
chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; where erythrocytes,
granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.
Like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei)
include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many
different immune cells.[69] In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen
and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut
and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes,
neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas
lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus.[70][71] In 2006, a
lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of
teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system
presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T_cells accumulate while waiting
to encounter an antigen.[72]
B and T lymphocytes bearing immunoglobulins and T_cell_receptors, respectively,
are found in all jawed fishes. Indeed, the adaptive_immune_system as a whole
evolved in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate.[73]
***** Conservation *****
The 2006 IUCN Red_List names 1,173 fish species that are threatened with
extinction.[74] Included are species such as Atlantic_cod,[75] Devil's_Hole
pupfish,[76] coelacanths,[77] and great_white_sharks.[78] Because fish live
underwater they are more difficult to study than terrestrial animals and
plants, and information about fish populations is often lacking. However,
freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in
relatively small water bodies. For example, the Devil's_Hole_pupfish occupies
only a single 3 by 6 metres (10 by 20 ft) pool.[79]
**** Overfishing ****
[Photo_of_shark_in_profile_surrounded_by_other,_much_smaller_fish_in_bright
sunlight]
Whale_sharks, the largest species of fish, are classified as vulnerable.
Main article: Overfishing
Overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and tuna.[80][81]
Overfishing eventually causes population (known as stock) collapse because the
survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial
extinction does not mean that the species is extinct, merely that it can no
longer sustain a fishery.
One well-studied example of fishery collapse is the Pacific_sardine Sadinops
sagax caerulues fishery off the California coast. From a 1937 peak of 790,000
long tons (800,000 t) the catch steadily declined to only 24,000 long tons
(24,000 t) in 1968, after which the fishery was no longer economically viable.
[82]
The main tension between fisheries_science and the fishing_industry is that the
two groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive
fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the fishing
industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it.[83]
[84] On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent
protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.[85]
[86]
**** Habitat destruction ****
See also: Environmental_impact_of_fishing
A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation
including water_pollution, the building of dams, removal of water for use by
humans, and the introduction of exotic species.[87] An example of a fish that
has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid_sturgeon, a North
American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.[88]
**** Exotic species ****
Introduction of non-native species has occurred in many habitats. One of the
best studied examples is the introduction of Nile_perch into Lake_Victoria in
the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid
species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others
are probably extinct.[89] Carp, snakeheads,[90] tilapia, European_perch, brown
trout, rainbow_trout, and sea_lampreys are other examples of fish that have
caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.
***** Importance to humans *****
**** Economic importance ****
Main articles: Fishing_industry, Aquaculture, and Fish_farming
[A_row_of_square_artificial_ponds,_with_trees_on_either_side]
These fish-farming ponds were created as a cooperative project in a rural
village.
Throughout history, humans have utilized fish_as_a_food_source. Historically
and today, most fish protein has come by means of catching wild fish. However,
aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE.
in China,[91] is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall,
about one-sixth of the world's protein is estimated to be provided by fish.[92]
That proportion is considerably elevated in some developing_nations and regions
heavily dependent on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to
trade.
Catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known as fishing, while the
organized effort by humans to catch fish is called a fishery. Fisheries are a
huge global business and provide income for millions of people.[92] The annual
yield from all fisheries worldwide is about 154 million tons,[93] with popular
species including herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, and salmon. However,
the term fishery is broadly applied, and includes more organisms than just
fish, such as mollusks and crustaceans, which are often called "fish" when used
as food.
**** Recreation ****
Main articles: Fishkeeping, Recreational_fishing, and Angling
Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for
food, appearing in cave_art, being raised as ornamental_fish in ponds, and
displayed in aquariums in homes, offices, or public settings.
Recreational fishing is fishing for pleasure or competition; it can be
contrasted with commercial_fishing, which is fishing for profit. The most
common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and
any one of a wide range of baits. Angling is a method of fishing, specifically
the practice of catching fish by means of an "angle" (hook). Anglers must
select the right hook, cast accurately, and retrieve at the right speed while
considering water and weather conditions, species, fish response, time of the
day, and other factors.
**** Culture ****

Avatar of Vishnu as a Matsya
Fish themes have symbolic significance in many religions. In ancient
Mesopotamia, fish offerings were made to the gods from the very earliest times.
[94] Fish were also a major symbol of Enki, the god of water.[94] Fish
frequently appear as filling motifs in cylinder_seals from the Old_Babylonian
(c. 1830 BC â c. 1531 BC) and Neo-Assyrian (911â609 BC) periods.[94]
Starting during the Kassite_Period (c. 1600 BC â c. 1155 BC) and lasting
until the early Persian_Period (550â30 BC), healers and exorcists dressed in
ritual garb resembling the bodies of fish.[94] During the Seleucid_Period
(312â63 BC), the legendary Babylonian culture_hero Oannes, described by
Berossus, was said to have dressed in the skin of a fish.[94] Fish were sacred
to the Syrian goddess Atargatis[95] and, during her festivals, only her priests
were permitted to eat them.[95]
The ichthus is a Christian symbol of a fish signifying that the person who uses
it is a Christian.[95][96]
In the Book_of_Jonah, a work of Jewish literature probably written in the
fourth century BC, the central figure, a prophet named Jonah, is swallowed by a
giant fish after being thrown overboard by the crew of the ship he is
travelling on.[97][98][99] The fish later vomits Jonah out on shore after three
days.[97][98][99] This book was later included as part of the Hebrew_Bible, or
Christian Old_Testament,[100][101] and a version of the story it contains is
summarized in Surah 37:139-148 of the Quran.[102] Early_Christians used the
ichthys, a symbol of a fish, to represent Jesus,[95][96] because the Greek word
for fish, ÎÎ§ÎÎ¥Î£ Ichthys, could be used as an acronym for "ÎÎ·ÏÎ¿á¿¦Ï
Î§ÏÎ¹ÏÏÏÏ, ÎÎµÎ¿á¿¦ Î¥á¼±ÏÏ, Î£ÏÏÎ®Ï" (Iesous Christos, Theou Huios,
Soter), meaning "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour".[95][96] The gospels also
refer to "fishers of men"[103] and feeding_the_multitude. In the dhamma of
Buddhism, the fish symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of
movement in the water. Often drawn in the form of carp which are regarded in
the Orient as sacred on account of their elegant beauty, size and life-span.
Among the deities said to take the form of a fish are Ika-Roa of the
Polynesians, Dagon of various ancient Semitic_peoples, the shark-gods of
Hawai&#x2bb;i and Matsya of the Hindus. The astrological symbol Pisces is based
on a constellation of the same_name, but there is also a second fish
constellation in the night sky, Piscis_Austrinus.[104]
Fish feature prominently in art and literature, in movies such as Finding_Nemo
and books such as The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea. Large fish, particularly sharks,
have frequently been the subject of horror_movies and thrillers, most notably
the novel Jaws, which spawned a series of films of the same_name that in turn
inspired similar films or parodies such as Shark_Tale and Snakehead_Terror.
Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as Piranha;
however, contrary to popular belief, the red-bellied_piranha is actually a
generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans.[105] Legends
of half-human, half-fish mermaids have featured in folklore, including the
stories of Hans_Christian_Andersen.
***** Terminology *****
**** Fish or fishes ****
Though often used interchangeably, in biology these words have different
meanings. Fish is used as a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple
individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe different species
or species groups.[106][107][108] Thus a pond that contained a single species
might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120
fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes.
The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.
**** True fish and finfish ****
    * In biology, the term fish is most strictly used to describe any animal
      with a backbone that has gills throughout life and has limbs, if any, in
      the shape of fins.[109] Many types of aquatic_animals with common names
      ending in "fish" are not fish in this sense; examples include shellfish,
      cuttlefish, starfish, crayfish and jellyfish. In earlier times, even
      biologists did not make a distinction â sixteenth century natural
      historians classified also seals, whales, amphibians, crocodiles, even
      hippopotamuses, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.[21]
    * In fisheries, the term fish is used as a collective term, and includes
      mollusks, crustaceans and any aquatic_animal which is harvested.[110]
    * The strict biological definition of a fish, above, is sometimes called a
      true fish. True fish are also referred to as finfish or fin fish to
      distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or
      aquaculture.
**** Shoal or school ****
Main article: Shoaling_and_schooling
[Photo_of_thousands_of_fish_separated_from_each_other_by_distances_of_2_inches_
(51 mm)_or_less]
These goldband_fusiliers are schooling because their swimming is synchronised.
A random assemblage of fish merely using some localised resource such as food
or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in
an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a
school depending on the degree of organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised
group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other
members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that
it remains close to the other members of the group. Schools of fish are much
more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at
the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is
believed to provide a variety of advantages.[111]
Examples:
    * Cichlids congregating at lekking sites form an aggregation.
    * Many minnows and characins form shoals.
    * Anchovies, herrings and silversides are classic examples of schooling
      fish.
While the words "school" and "shoal" have different meanings within biology,
the distinctions are often ignored by non-specialists who treat the words as
synonyms. Thus speakers of British_English commonly use "shoal" to describe any
grouping of fish, and speakers of American_English commonly use "school" just
as loosely.[112]
