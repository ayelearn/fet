Clostridium is a genus of Gram-positive_bacteria. This genus includes several
significant human pathogens, including the causative agent of botulism. The
genus formerly included an important cause of diarrhea, Clostridioides
difficile, which was separated after 16S rRNA analysis. They are obligate
anaerobes capable of producing endospores. The normal, reproducing cells of
Clostridium, called the vegetative form, are rod-shaped, which gives them their
name, from the Greek ÃÂºÃÂ»ÃÂ‰ÃÂƒÃÂ„ÃÂ®ÃÂ or spindle. Clostridium endospores have a
distinct bowling pin or bottle shape, distinguishing them from other bacterial
endospores, which are usually ovoid in shape. Clostridium species inhabit soils
and the intestinal tract of animals, including humans.[2] Clostridium is a
normal inhabitant of the healthy lower reproductive tract of women.[3]
The gut_microbiota of healthy humans contains commensal Clostridium bacteria.
[4] Species from Clostridium cluster XIVa and Clostridium cluster IV are
important in human guts, but despite the naming, these clusters encompass many
bacteria outside the genus Clostridium.[4]

***** Overview[edit] *****
Clostridium contains around 100 species that include common free-living
bacteria, as well as important pathogens.[5] The main species responsible for
disease in humans are:[6]
    * Clostridium_botulinum can produce botulinum_toxin in food or wounds and
      can cause botulism. This same toxin is known as Botox and is used in
      cosmetic_surgery to paralyze facial muscles to reduce the signs of aging;
      it also has numerous other therapeutic uses.
    * Clostridium_perfringens causes a wide range of symptoms, from food
      poisoning to cellulitis, fasciitis, and gas_gangrene.
    * Clostridium_tetani causes tetanus.
    * Clostridium_sordellii can cause a fatal infection in exceptionally rare
      cases after medical abortions.[7]
Bacillus and Clostridium are often described as gram-variable, because they
show an increasing number of gram-negative cells as the culture ages.[8]
Clostridium and Bacillus are both in the phylum Firmicutes, but they are in
different classes, orders, and families. Microbiologists distinguish
Clostridium from Bacillus by the following features:[2]
    * Clostridium grows in anaerobic conditions; Bacillus grows in aerobic
      conditions.
    * Clostridium forms bottle-shaped endospores; Bacillus forms oblong
      endospores.
    * Clostridium does not form the enzyme catalase; Bacillus secretes catalase
      to destroy toxic byproducts of oxygen metabolism.
Clostridium and Desulfotomaculum are both in the class Clostridia and order
Clostridiales, and they both produce bottle-shaped endospores, but they are in
different families. Clostridium can be distinguished from Desulfotomaculum on
the basis of the nutrients each genus uses (the latter requires sulfur).
Glycolysis and fermentation of pyruvic_acid by Clostridia yield the end
products butyric_acid, butanol, acetone, isopropanol, and carbon_dioxide.[8]
The Schaeffer-Fulton_stain (0.5% malachite_green in water) can be used to
distinguish endospores of Bacillus and Clostridium from other microorganisms.
[9] There is a commercially available polymerase_chain_reaction (PCR) test kit
(Bactotype) for the detection of C. perfringens and other pathogenic bacteria.
[10]
***** Treatment[edit] *****
In general, the treatment of clostridial infection is high-dose penicillin_G,
to which the organism has remained susceptible.[11] Clostridium_welchii and
Clostridium_tetani respond to sulfonamides.[12] Clostridia are also susceptible
to tetracyclines, carbapenems (imipenem), metronidazole, vancomycin, and
chloramphenicol.[13]
The vegetative cells of clostridia are heat-labile and are killed by short
heating at temperatures above 72Ã¢Â€Â“75Â Ã‚Â°C. The thermal destruction of
Clostridium spores requires higher temperatures (above 121.1Â Ã‚Â°C, for example
in an autoclave) and longer cooking times (20Â min, with a few exceptional cases
of > 50Â min recorded in the literature). Clostridia and Bacilli are quite
radiation-resistant, requiring doses of about 30Â kGy, which is a serious
obstacle to the development of shelf-stable irradiated_foods for general use in
the retail market.[14] The addition of lysozyme, nitrate, nitrite and propionic
acid salts inhibits clostridia in various foods.[15][16][17]
Fructooligosaccharides (fructans) such as inulin, occurring in relatively large
amounts in a number of foods such as chicory, garlic, onion, leek, artichoke,
and asparagus, have a prebiotic or bifidogenic effect, selectively promoting
the growth and metabolism of beneficial bacteria in the colon, such as
bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, while inhibiting harmful ones, such as
clostridia, fusobacteria, and bacteroides.[18]
***** History[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (April
         2019)
In the late 1700s, Germany experienced a number of outbreaks of an illness that
seemed connected to eating certain sausages. In 1817, the German neurologist
Justinus_Kerner detected rod-shaped cells in his investigations into this so-
called sausage poisoning. In 1897, the Belgian biology professor Emile_van
Ermengem published his finding of an endospore-forming organism he isolated
from spoiled ham. Biologists classified van Ermengem's discovery along with
other known gram-positive spore formers in the genus Bacillus. This
classification presented problems, however, because the isolate grew only in
anaerobic conditions, but Bacillus grew well in oxygen.[2]
Circa 1880, in the course of studying fermentation and butyric_acid synthesis,
a scientist surnamed Prazmowski first assigned a binomial name to Clostridium
butyricum.[19]:107Ã¢Â€Â“108 The mechanisms of anaerobic_respiration were still not
yet well elucidated at that time,[19]:107Ã¢Â€Â“108 so taxonomy of anaerobes was
still nascent.
In 1924, Ida_A._Bengtson separated van Ermengem's microorganisms from the
Bacillus group and assigned them to the genus Clostridium. By Bengtson's
classification scheme, Clostridium contained all of the anaerobic endospore-
forming rod-shaped bacteria, except the genus Desulfotomaculum.[2]
***** Use[edit] *****
    * Clostridium_thermocellum can use lignocellulosic waste and generate
      ethanol, thus making it a possible candidate for use in production of
      ethanol_fuel. It also has no oxygen requirement and is thermophilic,
      which reduces cooling cost.
    * Clostridium_acetobutylicum was first used by Chaim_Weizmann to produce
      acetone and biobutanol from starch in 1916 for the production of cordite
      (smokeless gunpowder).
    * Clostridium_botulinum produces a potentially lethal neurotoxin used in a
      diluted form in the drug Botox, which is carefully injected to nerves in
      the face, which prevents the movement of the expressive muscles of the
      forehead, to delay the wrinkling effect of aging. It is also used to
      treat spasmodic_torticollis and provides relief for around 12 to 16
      weeks.[20]
    * Clostridium_butyricum MIYAIRI 588 strain is marketed in Japan, Korea, and
      China for Clostridium_difficile prophylaxis due to its reported ability
      to interfere with the growth of the latter.
    * Clostridium_histolyticum has been used as a source of the enzyme
      collagenase, which degrades animal tissue. Clostridium species excrete
      collagenase to eat through tissue and, thus, help the pathogen spread
      throughout the body. The medical profession uses collagenase for the same
      reason in the dÃƒÂ©bridement of infected wounds.[2] Hyaluronidase,
      deoxyribonuclease, lecithinase, leukocidin, protease, lipase, and
      hemolysin are also produced by some clostridia that cause gas gangrene.
      [8][21]
    * Clostridium_ljungdahlii, recently discovered in commercial chicken
      wastes, can produce ethanol from single-carbon sources including
      synthesis_gas, a mixture of carbon_monoxide and hydrogen, that can be
      generated from the partial combustion of either fossil_fuels or biomass.
      [22]
    * Clostridium_butyricum converts glycerol to 1,3-propanediol.[23]
    * Genes from Clostridium_thermocellum have been inserted into transgenic
      mice to allow the production of endoglucanase. The experiment was
      intended to learn more about how the digestive capacity of monogastric
      animals could be improved.
    * Nonpathogenic strains of Clostridium may help in the treatment of
      diseases such as cancer. Research shows that Clostridium can selectively
      target cancer cells. Some strains can enter and replicate within solid
      tumors. Clostridium could, therefore, be used to deliver therapeutic
      proteins to tumours. This use of Clostridium has been demonstrated in a
      variety of preclinical models.[24]
    * Mixtures of Clostridium species, such as Clostridium_beijerinckii,
      Clostridium_butyricum, and species from other genera have been shown to
      produce biohydrogen from yeast waste.[25]
