German sauerkraut
Sauerkraut (/ËsaÊ.ÉrkraÊt/; German:[ËzaÊÉËkÊaÊt] ([About_this
sound]listen), lit. "sour cabbage"[1]) is finely cut raw cabbage that has been
fermented by various lactic_acid_bacteria.[2][3] It has a long shelf_life and a
distinctive sour flavor, both of which result from the lactic_acid formed when
the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage leaves.[4][5]

***** Overview and history[edit] *****
Polish kiszona kapusta
Fermented foods have a long history in many cultures, with sauerkraut being one
of the most well-known instances of traditional fermented moist cabbage side
dishes.[6][better source needed] The Roman writers Cato (in his De_Agri
Cultura) and Columella (in his De_re_Rustica) mentioned preserving cabbages and
turnips with salt.[citation_needed]
Although "sauerkraut" is a German word, the dish did not originate in Germany.
Some claim that the Mongol_Emperor Genghis_Khan brought it to Europe.[7] Others
claim that it originally came from China and the surrounding areas and Europe
the Tatars brought it to Europe,[8] and improved upon the original Chinese
recipe by fermenting it with salt instead of rice wine.[9] It took root mostly
in Central and Eastern_European cuisines, but also in other countries including
the Netherlands, where it is known as zuurkool, and France, where the name
became choucroute.[10] The English name is borrowed from German where it means
literally "sour herb" or "sour cabbage".[11] The names in Slavic and other
Central_and_Eastern_European languages have similar meanings with the German
word: "fermented cabbage" (Albanian: lakÃ«r turshi, Azerbaijani: kÉlÉm
turÅusu,[12] Belarusian: ÐºÐ²Ð°ÑÐ°Ð½Ð°Ñ ÐºÐ°Ð¿ÑÑÑÐ°, Czech: kysanÃ©

Before frozen_foods, refrigeration, and cheap transport from warmer areas
became readily available in northern, central and eastern_Europe, sauerkraut
â like other preserved foods â provided a source of nutrients during the
winter. Captain James_Cook always took a store of sauerkraut on his sea
voyages, since experience had taught him it prevented scurvy.[14][15]
The word "Kraut", derived from this food, is a derogatory term for the German
people.[16] During World_War_I, due to concerns the American public would
reject a product with a German name, American sauerkraut makers relabeled their
product as "Liberty Cabbage" for the duration of the war.[17]
***** Production[edit] *****
Homemade sauerkraut
Sauerkraut is made by a process of pickling called lactic_acid_fermentation
that is analogous to how traditional (not heat-treated) pickled_cucumbers and
kimchi are made. The cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt, and left to
ferment. Fully cured sauerkraut keeps for several months in an airtight
container stored at 15 Â°C (60 Â°F) or below. Neither refrigeration nor
pasteurization is required, although these treatments prolong storage life.
Fermentation by lactobacilli is introduced naturally, as these air-borne
bacteria culture on raw cabbage leaves where they grow. Yeasts also are
present, and may yield soft sauerkraut of poor flavor when the fermentation
temperature is too high. The fermentation process has three phases,
collectively sometimes referred to as population dynamics. In the first phase,
anaerobic bacteria such as Klebsiella and Enterobacter lead the fermentation,
and begin producing an acidic environment that favors later bacteria. The
second phase starts as the acid levels become too high for many bacteria, and
Leuconostoc_mesenteroides and other Leuconostoc spp. take dominance. In the
third phase, various Lactobacillus species, including L._brevis and L.
plantarum, ferment any remaining sugars, further lowering the pH.[18] Properly
cured sauerkraut is sufficiently acidic to prevent a favorable environment for
the growth of Clostridium_botulinum, the toxins of which cause botulism.[2][3]
A 2004 genomic study found an unexpectedly large diversity of lactic acid
bacteria in sauerkraut, and that previous studies had oversimplified this
diversity. Weissella was found to be a major organism in the initial,
heterofermentative stage, up to day 7. It was also found that Lactobacillus
brevis and Pediococcus pentosaceus had smaller population numbers in the first
14 days than previous studies had reported.[19]
The Dutch sauerkraut industry found that inoculating a new batch of sauerkraut
with an old batch resulted in an excessively sour product. This sourdough
process is known as "backslopping" or "inoculum enrichment"; when used in
making sauerkraut, first- and second-stage population dynamics, important to
developing flavor, are bypassed. This is due primarily to the greater initial
activity of species L. plantarum.[20]
***** Regional varieties[edit] *****
Eastern European-style sauerkraut pickled with carrots and served as a salad
In Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Polish, Russian, Baltic_states and Ukrainian
cuisine, chopped cabbage is often pickled together with shredded carrots. Other
ingredients may include whole or quartered apples for additional flavor or
cranberry for flavor and better keeping (the benzoic_acid in cranberries is a
common preservative). Bell_peppers and beets are added in some recipes for
colour. The resulting sauerkraut salad is typically served cold, as zakuski or
a side dish. A home made type of very mild sauerkraut is available, where white
cabbage is pickled with salt in a refrigerator for only three to seven days.
This process results in very little lactic acid production. Sometimes in Russia
the double fermentation is used, with the initial step producing an
exceptionally sour product, which is then "corrected" by adding 30-50% more
fresh cabbage and fermenting the mix again. The flavor additives like apples,
beets, cranberries and sometimes even watermelons are usually introduced at
this step.
Sauerkraut may be used as a filling for Polish pierogi, Romanian sarmale and
galuste, Ukrainian varenyky, Russian pirogiand pirozhki.[21] Sauerkraut is also
the central ingredient in traditional soups, such as shchi (a national_dish of
Russia), kwaÅnica (Poland), kapustnica (Slovakia), and zelÅaÄka (Czech
Republic). It is an ingredient of Polish bigos (a hunter's stew). [1]
In Germany, cooked sauerkraut is often flavored with juniper_berries[22] or
caraway seeds; apples and white wine are added in popular variations.
Traditionally it is served warm, with pork (e.g. eisbein, schweinshaxe,
Kassler) or sausages (smoked or fried sausages, Frankfurter_WÃ¼rstchen, Vienna
sausages, black_pudding), accompanied typically by roasted or steamed potatoes
or dumplings (knÃ¶del or schupfnudel).[23] Similar recipes are common in other
Central European cuisines. The Czech national_dish vepÅo knedlo zelo consists
of roast pork with knedliky and sauerkraut.
In France, sauerkraut is the main ingredient of the Alsatian meal choucroute
garnie (French for "dressed sauerkraut"), sauerkraut with sausages (Strasbourg
sausages, smoked Morteau or MontbÃ©liard sausages), charcuterie (bacon, ham,
etc.), and often potatoes.
Sauerkraut, along with pork, is eaten traditionally in Pennsylvania on New
Year's Day. The tradition, started by the Pennsylvania_Dutch, is thought to
bring good luck for the upcoming year.[24] Sauerkraut is also used in American
cuisine as a condiment upon various foods, such as sandwiches and hot dogs.[4]
[5][25] In Maryland, particularly in Baltimore and on the Eastern Shore,
sauerkraut is a traditional accompaniment for the Thanksgiving turkey.[26]

Many health benefits have been claimed for sauerkraut:
    * It is a high source of vitamins C and K;[27] the fermentation process
      increases the bioavailability of nutrients rendering sauerkraut even more
      nutritious than the original cabbage.[28] It is also low in calories and
      high in calcium and magnesium, and it is a very good source of dietary
      fiber, folate, iron, potassium, copper and manganese.[27]
    * If unpasteurized and uncooked, sauerkraut also contains live lactobacilli
      and beneficial microbes and is rich in enzymes. Fiber and probiotics
      improve digestion and promote the growth of healthy bowel flora,
      protecting against many diseases of the digestive tract.[28][29]
    * During the American_Civil_War, the physician John_Jay_Terrell
      (1829â1922)[30] was able to successfully reduce the death rate from
      disease among prisoners of war; he attributed this to feeding his
      patients raw sauerkraut.[31]
    * Sauerkraut and its juice is a time-honored folk_remedy for canker_sores.
      The treatment is to rinse the mouth with sauerkraut juice for about 30
      seconds several times a day, or place a wad of sauerkraut against the
      affected area for a minute or so before chewing and swallowing the
      sauerkraut.[32]
    * In 2002, the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry reported that
      Finnish researchers found the isothiocyanates produced in sauerkraut
      fermentation inhibit the growth of cancer_cells in test tube and animal
      studies.[33] A Polish study in 2010 concluded that "induction of the key
      detoxifying enzymes by cabbage juices, particularly sauerkraut, may be
      responsible for their chemopreventive activity demonstrated by
      epidemiological studies and in animal models".[34][35][36][37][38][39]
      [40][41]
    * Sauerkraut is high in the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, both
      associated with preserving ocular_health.[42]
**** Disadvantages[edit] ****
Excessive consumption of sauerkraut may lead to bloating and flatulence due to
the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small_intestine cannot break down.
[43]
***** Scientific discovery[edit] *****
One of the early scientists who was involved in identifying the biology and
function of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR),
Philippe_Horvath, focused on the genetics of a lactic-acid bacteria used in the
production of sauerkraut.[44]
