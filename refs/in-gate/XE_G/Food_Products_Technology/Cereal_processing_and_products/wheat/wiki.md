Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a
worldwide staple_food.[2][3][4] The many_species_of_wheat together make up the
genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common_wheat (T. aestivum).
The archaeological_record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the
regions of the Fertile_Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel
is a type of fruit called a caryopsis.
Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million
hectares, 2014).[5] World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops
combined.[6] In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes,[7]
making it the second most-produced cereal after maize.[7][8] Since 1960, world
production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow
further through the middle of the 21st_century.[9] Global demand for wheat is
increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten
proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption
is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the
westernization_of_the_diet.[10][11]
Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates.[10] Globally, it is the leading
source of vegetal protein in human food, having a protein content of about 13%,
which is relatively high compared to other major cereals [12] but relatively
low in protein_quality for supplying essential_amino_acids.[13][14] When eaten
as the whole_grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary_fiber.
[10]
In a small part of the general population, gluten â the major part of wheat
protein â can trigger coeliac_disease, noncoeliac_gluten_sensitivity, gluten
ataxia, and dermatitis_herpetiformis.[15]

***** Origin and history[edit] *****
Spikelets of a hulled wheat, einkorn
Cultivation and repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of wild grasses
led to the creation of domestic strains, as mutant forms ('sports') of wheat
were preferentially chosen by farmers. In domesticated wheat, grains are
larger, and the seeds (inside the spikelets) remain attached to the ear by a
toughened rachis during harvesting.[16] In wild strains, a more fragile rachis
allows the ear to easily shatter and disperse the spikelets.[17] Selection for
these traits by farmers might not have been deliberately intended, but simply
have occurred because these traits made gathering the seeds easier;
nevertheless such 'incidental' selection was an important part of crop
domestication. As the traits that improve wheat as a food source also involve
the loss of the plant's natural seed dispersal mechanisms, highly domesticated
strains of wheat cannot survive in the wild.
Cultivation of wheat began to spread beyond the Fertile_Crescent after about
8000 BCE. Jared_Diamond traces the spread of cultivated emmer_wheat starting in
the Fertile Crescent sometime before 8800 BCE. Archaeological analysis of wild
emmer indicates that it was first cultivated in the southern Levant, with finds
dating back as far as 9600 BCE.[18][19] Genetic analysis of wild einkorn wheat
suggests that it was first grown in the Karacadag_Mountains in southeastern
Turkey. Dated archeological remains of einkorn wheat in settlement sites near
this region, including those at Abu_Hureyra in Syria, suggest the domestication
of einkorn near the Karacadag Mountain Range.[20] With the anomalous exception
of two grains from Iraq_ed-Dubb, the earliest carbon-14 date for einkorn wheat
remains at Abu_Hureyra is 7800 to 7500 years BCE.[21]
Remains of harvested emmer from several sites near the Karacadag Range have
been dated to between 8600 (at Cayonu) and 8400 BCE (Abu Hureyra), that is, in
the Neolithic_period. With the exception of Iraq ed-Dubb, the earliest carbon-
14 dated remains of domesticated emmer wheat were found in the earliest levels
of Tell_Aswad, in the Damascus basin, near Mount_Hermon in Syria. These remains
were dated by Willem_van_Zeist and his assistant Johanna Bakker-Heeres to
8800 BCE. They also concluded that the settlers of Tell Aswad did not develop
this form of emmer themselves, but brought the domesticated grains with them
from an as yet unidentified location elsewhere.[22]
The cultivation of emmer reached Greece, Cyprus and Indian_subcontinent by
6500 BCE, Egypt shortly after 6000 BCE, and Germany and Spain by 5000 BCE.[23]
"The early Egyptians were developers of bread and the use of the oven and
developed baking into one of the first large-scale food production industries."
[24] By 3000 BCE, wheat had reached the British Isles and Scandinavia. A
millennium later it reached China.
The oldest evidence for hexaploid wheat has been confirmed through DNA analysis
of wheat seeds, dating to around 6400-6200 BCE, recovered from ÃatalhÃ¶yÃ¼k.
[25] The first identifiable bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) with sufficient
gluten for yeasted breads has been identified using DNA analysis in samples
from a granary dating to approximately 1350 BCE at Assiros in Macedonia.[26]
From Asia, wheat continued to spread across Europe. In the British Isles, wheat
straw (thatch) was used for roofing in the Bronze Age, and was in common use
until the late 19th century.[27]
***** Farming techniques[edit] *****

Technological advances in soil preparation and seed placement at planting time,
use of crop_rotation and fertilizers to improve plant growth, and advances in
harvesting methods have all combined to promote wheat as a viable crop. When
the use of seed_drills replaced broadcasting sowing of seed in the 18th
century, another great increase in productivity occurred.
Yields of pure wheat per unit area increased as methods of crop rotation were
applied to long cultivated land, and the use of fertilizers became widespread.
Improved agricultural husbandry has more recently included threshing machines
and reaping machines (the 'combine_harvester'), tractor-drawn cultivators and
planters, and better varieties (see Green_Revolution and Norin_10_wheat). Great
expansion of wheat production occurred as new arable land was farmed in the
Americas and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries.
***** Physiology[edit] *****
Leaves emerge from the shoot apical meristem in a telescoping fashion until the
transition to reproduction ie. flowering.[28] The last leaf produced by a wheat
plant is known as the flag leaf. It is denser and has a higher photosynthetic
rate than other leaves, to supply carbohydrate to the developing ear. In
temperate countries the flag leaf, along with the second and third highest leaf
on the plant, supply the majority of carbohydrate in the grain and their
condition is paramount to yield formation.[29][30] Wheat is unusual among
plants in having more stomata on the upper (adaxial) side of the leaf, than on
the under (abaxial) side.[31] It has been theorised that this might be an
effect of it having been domesticated and cultivated longer than any other
plant.[32] Winter wheat generally produces up to 15 leaves per shoot and spring
wheat up to 9[33] and winter crops may have up to 35 tillers (shoots) per plant
(depending on cultivar).[33]
Wheat roots are among the deepest of arable crops, extending as far down as 2m.
[34] While the roots of a wheat plant are growing, the plant also accumulates
an energy store in its stem, in the form of fructans,[35] which helps the plant
to yield under drought and disease pressure,[36] but it has been observed that
there is a trade-off between root growth and stem non-structural carbohydrate
reserves.[37] Root growth is likely to be prioritised in drought-adapted crops,
while stem non-structural carbohydrate is prioritised in varieties developed
for countries where disease is a bigger issue. Depending on variety, wheat may
be awned or not awned. Producing awns incurs a cost in grain number,[38] but
wheat awns photosynthesise more water-use-efficiently than their leaves,[39] so
awns are much more frequent in varieties of wheat grown in hot drought-prone
countries than those generally seen in temperate countries. For this reason,
awned varieties could become more widely grown due to climate_change. In
Europe, however, a decline in climate resilience of wheat has been observed.
[40]
***** Genetics[edit] *****
Wheat genetics is more complicated than that of most other domesticated
species. Some wheat species are diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, but many
are stable polyploids, with four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six
(hexaploid).[41]
    * Einkorn wheat (T. monococcum) is diploid (AA, two complements of seven
      chromosomes, 2n=14).[4]
    * Most tetraploid wheats (e.g. emmer and durum_wheat) are derived from wild
      emmer, T. dicoccoides. Wild emmer is itself the result of a hybridization
      between two diploid wild grasses, T. urartu and a wild goatgrass such as
      Aegilops searsii or Ae._speltoides. The unknown grass has never been
      identified among now surviving wild grasses, but the closest living
      relative is Aegilops speltoides.[42] The hybridization that formed wild
      emmer (AABB) occurred in the wild, long before domestication,[41] and was
      driven by natural selection.
    * Hexaploid wheats evolved in farmers' fields. Either domesticated emmer or
      durum wheat hybridized with yet another wild diploid grass (Aegilops
      tauschii) to make the hexaploid wheats, spelt wheat and bread_wheat.[41]
      These have three sets of paired chromosomes, three times as many as in
      diploid wheat.
The presence of certain versions of wheat genes has been important for crop
yields. Apart from mutant versions of genes selected in antiquity during
domestication, there has been more recent deliberate selection of alleles that
affect growth characteristics. Genes for the 'dwarfing' trait, first used by
Japanese_wheat_breeders to produce short-stalked wheat, have had a huge effect
on wheat yields worldwide, and were major factors in the success of the Green
Revolution in Mexico and Asia, an initiative led by Norman_Borlaug. Dwarfing
genes enable the carbon that is fixed in the plant during photosynthesis to be
diverted towards seed production, and they also help prevent the problem of
lodging. 'Lodging' occurs when an ear stalk falls over in the wind and rots on
the ground, and heavy nitrogenous fertilization of wheat makes the grass grow
taller and become more susceptible to this problem. By 1997, 81% of the
developing world's wheat area was planted to semi-dwarf wheats, giving both
increased yields and better response to nitrogenous fertilizer.
Wild grasses in the genus Triticum and related genera, and grasses such as rye
have been a source of many disease-resistance traits for cultivated wheat
breeding since the 1930s.[43]
Heterosis, or hybrid vigor (as in the familiar F1 hybrids of maize), occurs in
common (hexaploid) wheat, but it is difficult to produce seed of hybrid
cultivars on a commercial scale (as is done with maize) because wheat flowers
are perfect and normally self-pollinate. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been
produced using chemical hybridizing agents; these chemicals selectively
interfere with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male
sterility systems. Hybrid wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe
(particularly France), the United States and South Africa.[44] F1 hybrid wheat
cultivars should not be confused with the standard method of breeding inbred
wheat cultivars by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then selfing or
inbreeding the progeny many (ten or more) generations before release selections
are identified to be released as a variety or cultivar.
Synthetic hexaploids made by crossing the wild goatgrass wheat ancestor
Aegilops_tauschii and various durum wheats are now being deployed, and these
increase the genetic diversity of cultivated wheats.[45][46][47]
Stomata (or leaf pores) are involved in both uptake of carbon dioxide gas from
the atmosphere and water vapor losses from the leaf due to water transpiration.
Basic physiological investigation of these gas exchange processes has yielded
valuable carbon isotope based methods that are used for breeding wheat
varieties with improved water-use efficiency. These varieties can improve crop
productivity in rain-fed dry-land wheat farms.[48]
In 2010, a team of UK scientists funded by BBSRC announced they had decoded the
wheat genome for the first time (95% of the genome of a variety of wheat known
as Chinese Spring line 42).[49] This genome was released in a basic format for
scientists and plant breeders to use but was not a fully annotated sequence
which was reported in some of the media.[50]
On 29 November 2012, an essentially complete gene set of bread wheat was
published.[51] Random shotgun libraries of total DNA and cDNA from the T.
aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS42) were sequenced in Roche 454 pyrosequencer
using GS FLX Titanium and GS FLX+ platforms to generate 85 Gb of sequence (220
million reads), equivalent to 5X genome coverage and identified between 94,000
and 96,000 genes.[51]
This sequence data provides direct access to about 96,000 genes, relying on
orthologous gene sets from other cereals. and represents an essential step
towards a systematic understanding of biology and engineering the cereal crop
for valuable traits. Its implications in cereal genetics and breeding includes
the examination of genome variation, association mapping using natural
populations, performing wide crosses and alien introgression, studying the
expression and nucleotide polymorphism in transcriptomes, analyzing population
genetics and evolutionary biology, and studying the epigenetic modifications.
Moreover, the availability of large-scale genetic markers generated through NGS
technology will facilitate trait mapping and make marker-assisted breeding much
more feasible.[52]
Moreover, the data not only facilitate in deciphering the complex phenomena
such as heterosis and epigenetics, it may also enable breeders to predict which
fragment of a chromosome is derived from which parent in the progeny line,
thereby recognizing crossover events occurring in every progeny line and
inserting markers on genetic and physical maps without ambiguity. In due
course, this will assist in introducing specific chromosomal segments from one
cultivar to another. Besides, the researchers had identified diverse classes of
genes participating in energy production, metabolism and growth that were
probably linked with crop yield, which can now be utilized for the development
of transgenic wheat. Thus whole genome sequence of wheat and the availability
of thousands of SNPs will inevitably permit the breeders to stride towards
identifying novel traits, providing biological knowledge and empowering
biodiversity-based breeding.[52]
***** Plant breeding[edit] *****
Sheaved and stooked wheat
Wheat field in Punjab
In traditional agricultural systems wheat populations often consist of
landraces, informal farmer-maintained populations that often maintain high
levels of morphological diversity. Although landraces of wheat are no longer
grown in Europe and North America, they continue to be important elsewhere. The
origins of formal wheat breeding lie in the nineteenth century, when single
line varieties were created through selection of seed from a single plant noted
to have desired properties. Modern wheat breeding developed in the first years
of the twentieth century and was closely linked to the development of Mendelian
genetics. The standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars is by crossing
two lines using hand emasculation, then selfing or inbreeding the progeny.
Selections are identified (shown to have the genes responsible for the varietal
differences) ten or more generations before release as a variety or cultivar.
[53]
The major breeding objectives include high grain yield, good quality, disease
and insect resistance and tolerance to abiotic stresses, including mineral,
moisture and heat tolerance. The major diseases in temperate environments
include the following, arranged in a rough order of their significance from
cooler to warmer climates: eyespot, Stagonospora_nodorum_blotch (also known as
glume blotch), yellow or stripe_rust, powdery_mildew, Septoria_tritici_blotch
(sometimes known as leaf blotch), brown or leaf_rust, Fusarium_head_blight, tan
spot and stem_rust. In tropical areas, spot_blotch (also known as
Helminthosporium leaf blight) is also important.
Wheat has also been the subject of mutation_breeding, with the use of gamma, x-
rays, ultraviolet light, and sometimes harsh chemicals. The varieties of wheat
created through these methods are in the hundreds (going as far back as 1960),
more of them being created in higher populated countries such as China.[54]
Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc content was developed through gamma
radiation breeding.[55] Modern bread wheat varieties have been cross-bred to
contain greater amounts of gluten,[56] which affords significant advantages for
improving the quality of breads and pastas from a functional point of view.[57]
Gluten is appreciated for its unique viscoelastic properties.[57] It gives
elasticity to dough and is responsible for dough's gas-retaining properties.
[57]
International wheat breeding is led by CIMMYT in Mexico. ICARDA is another
major public sector international wheat breeder, but it was forced to relocate
from Syria in the Syrian_Civil_War. The world record wheat yield is about 17t/
ha, reached in New Zealand in 2017.[58] A project in the UK, led by Rothamsted
Research has aimed to raise wheat yields in the country to 20t/ha by 2020, but
in 2018 the UK record stood at 16t/ha, and the average yield was just 8t/ha.
[59][60]
**** Hybrid wheat[edit] ****
Because wheat self-pollinates, creating hybrid_varieties is extremely labor-
intensive; the high cost of hybrid wheat seed relative to its moderate benefits
have kept farmers from adopting them widely[61][62] despite nearly 90 years of
effort.[63] F1_hybrid wheat cultivars should not be confused with wheat
cultivars deriving from standard plant_breeding. Heterosis or hybrid vigor (as
in the familiar F1 hybrids of maize) occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, but it
is difficult to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale as is
done with maize because wheat flowers are perfect in the botanical sense,
meaning they have both male and female parts, and normally self-pollinate.[53]
Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been produced using chemical hybridizing
agents, plant_growth_regulators that selectively interfere with pollen
development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic_male_sterility systems. Hybrid
wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France),
the United_States and South Africa.[64]
***** Hulled versus free-threshing wheat[edit] *****
Left: Naked wheat, Bread wheat Triticum aestivum; Right: Hulled wheat, Einkorn,
Triticum monococcum. Note how the einkorn ear breaks down into intact
spikelets.
The four wild species of wheat, along with the domesticated varieties einkorn,
[65] emmer[66] and spelt,[67] have hulls. This more primitive morphology (in
evolutionary terms) consists of toughened glumes that tightly enclose the
grains, and (in domesticated wheats) a semi-brittle rachis that breaks easily
on threshing. The result is that when threshed, the wheat ear breaks up into
spikelets. To obtain the grain, further processing, such as milling or
pounding, is needed to remove the hulls or husks. In contrast, in free-
threshing (or naked) forms such as durum wheat and common wheat, the glumes are
fragile and the rachis tough. On threshing, the chaff breaks up, releasing the
grains. Hulled wheats are often stored as spikelets because the toughened
glumes give good protection against pests of stored grain.[65]
***** Naming[edit] *****
Further information: Taxonomy_of_wheat

Model of a wheat grain, Botanical_Museum_Greifswald
There are many botanical classification systems used for wheat species,
discussed in a separate article on wheat_taxonomy. The name of a wheat species
from one information source may not be the name of a wheat species in another.
Within a species, wheat cultivars are further classified by wheat breeders and
farmers in terms of:
    * Growing season, such as winter_wheat vs. spring wheat.[68]
    * Protein content. Bread wheat protein content ranges from 10% in some soft
      wheats with high starch contents, to 15% in hard wheats.
    * The quality of the wheat protein gluten. This protein can determine the
      suitability of a wheat to a particular dish. A strong and elastic gluten
      present in bread wheats enables dough to trap carbon dioxide during
      leavening, but elastic gluten interferes with the rolling of pasta into
      thin sheets. The gluten protein in durum wheats used for pasta is strong
      but not elastic.
    * Grain color (red, white or amber). Many wheat varieties are reddish-brown
      due to phenolic compounds present in the bran layer which are transformed
      to pigments by browning enzymes. White wheats have a lower content of
      phenolics and browning enzymes, and are generally less astringent in
      taste than red wheats. The yellowish color of durum wheat and semolina
      flour made from it is due to a carotenoid pigment called lutein, which
      can be oxidized to a colorless form by enzymes present in the grain.

Hexaploid species
    * Common_wheat or bread wheat (T. aestivum) â A hexaploid species that is
      the most widely cultivated in the world.
    * Spelt (T. spelta) â Another hexaploid species cultivated in limited
      quantities.[quantify] Spelt is sometimes considered a subspecies[by
      whom?] of the closely related species common_wheat (T. aestivum), in
      which case its botanical name is considered to be T. aestivum ssp.
      spelta.
Tetraploid species
    * Durum (T. durum) â A tetraploid form of wheat widely used today, and
      the second most widely cultivated wheat.
    * Emmer (T. dicoccon) â A tetraploid species, cultivated in ancient_times
      but no longer in widespread use.
    * Khorasan (T. turgidum ssp. turanicum, also called T. turanicum) is a
      tetraploid wheat species. It is an ancient grain type; Khorasan refers to
      a historical region in modern-day Afghanistan and the northeast of Iran.
      This grain is twice the size of modern-day wheat and is known for its
      rich nutty flavor.
Diploid species
    * Einkorn (T. monococcum) â A diploid species with wild and cultivated
      variants. Domesticated at the same time as emmer wheat.
**** Classes used in North America[edit] ****
The named classes of wheat in English are more or less the same in Canada as in
the US, as broadly the same commercial cash crop strains can be found in both.
The classes used in the United_States are :[69][70]
    * Durum â Very hard, translucent, light-colored grain used to make
      semolina flour for pasta & bulghur; high in protein, specifically, gluten
      protein.
    * Hard Red Spring â Hard, brownish, high-protein wheat used for bread and
      hard baked goods. Bread Flour and high-gluten flours are commonly made
      from hard red spring wheat. It is primarily traded at the Minneapolis
      Grain_Exchange.
    * Hard Red Winter â Hard, brownish, mellow high-protein wheat used for
      bread, hard baked goods and as an adjunct in other flours to increase
      protein in pastry flour for pie crusts. Some brands of unbleached all-
      purpose flours are commonly made from hard red winter wheat alone. It is
      primarily traded on the Kansas_City_Board_of_Trade. One variety is known
      as "turkey red wheat", and was brought to Kansas by Mennonite immigrants
      from Russia.[71]
    * Soft Red Winter â Soft, low-protein wheat used for cakes, pie crusts,
      biscuits, and muffins. Cake flour, pastry flour, and some self-rising
      flours with baking_powder and salt added, for example, are made from soft
      red winter wheat. It is primarily traded on the Chicago_Board_of_Trade.
    * Hard White â Hard, light-colored, opaque, chalky, medium-protein wheat
      planted in dry, temperate areas. Used for bread and brewing.
    * Soft White â Soft, light-colored, very low protein wheat grown in
      temperate moist areas. Used for pie crusts and pastry. Pastry flour, for
      example, is sometimes made from soft white winter wheat.
Red wheats may need bleaching; therefore, white wheats usually command higher
prices than red wheats on the commodities market.

Raw wheat can be ground into flour or, using hard durum wheat only, can be
ground into semolina; germinated and dried creating malt; crushed or cut into
cracked wheat; parboiled (or steamed), dried, crushed and de-branned into
bulgur also known as groats.[citation_needed] If the raw wheat is broken into
parts at the mill, as is usually done, the outer husk or bran can be used
several ways
Wheat is a major ingredient in such foods as bread, porridge, crackers,
biscuits, Muesli, pancakes, pasta and noodles, pies, pastries, pizza, polenta
and semolina, cakes, cookies, muffins, rolls, doughnuts, gravy, beer, vodka,
boza (a fermented_beverage), and breakfast_cereals.[72]
In manufacturing wheat products, gluten is valuable to impart viscoelastic
functional qualities in dough,[73] enabling the preparation of diverse
processed foods such as breads, noodles, and pasta that facilitate wheat
consumption.[74][10]
**** Nutrition[edit] ****
In 100 grams, wheat provides 327 kilocalories and is a rich source (20% or more
of the Daily_Value, DV) of multiple essential_nutrients, such as protein,
dietary_fiber, manganese, phosphorus and niacin (table). Several B_vitamins and
other dietary_minerals are in significant content. Wheat is 13% water, 71%
carbohydrates, and 1.5% fat. Its 13% protein content is mostly gluten (75-80%
of the protein in wheat).[73]
Wheat proteins have a low quality for human nutrition, according to the new
protein quality method (DIAAS) promoted by the Food_and_Agriculture
Organization.[14][75] Though they contain adequate amounts of the other
essential amino acids, at least for adults, wheat proteins are deficient in the
essential_amino_acid, lysine.[10][76] Because the proteins present in the wheat
endosperm (gluten proteins) are particularly poor in lysine, white_flours are
more deficient in lysine compared with whole grains.[10] Significant efforts in
plant breeding are being made to develop lysine-rich wheat varieties, without
success as of 2017.[77] Supplementation with proteins from other food sources
(mainly legumes) is commonly used to compensate for this deficiency,[13] since
the limitation of a single essential amino acid causes the others to break down
and become excreted, which is especially important during the period of growth.

100 g (3.5 oz) of hard red winter wheat contain about 12.6 g (0.44 oz) of
protein, 1.5 g (0.053 oz) of total fat, 71 g (2.5 oz) of carbohydrate (by
difference), 12.2 g (0.43 oz) of dietary_fiber, and 3.2 mg (0.00011 oz) of iron
(17% of the daily requirement); the same weight of hard red spring wheat
contains about 15.4 g (0.54 oz) of protein, 1.9 g (0.067 oz) of total fat, 68 g
(2.4 oz) of carbohydrate (by difference), 12.2 g (0.43 oz) of dietary fiber,
and 3.6 mg (0.00013 oz) of iron (20% of the daily requirement).[82]
**** Worldwide consumption[edit] ****
Wheat is grown on more than 218,000,000 hectares (540,000,000 acres),[83] a
larger area than for any other crop. World trade in wheat is greater than for
all other crops combined. With rice, wheat is the world's most favored staple
food. It is a major diet component because of the wheat plant's agronomic
adaptability with the ability to grow from near arctic regions to equator, from
sea level to plains of Tibet, approximately 4,000 m (13,000 ft) above sea
level. In addition to agronomic adaptability, wheat offers ease of grain
storage and ease of converting grain into flour for making edible, palatable,
interesting and satisfying foods. Wheat is the most important source of
carbohydrate in a majority of countries.[citation_needed]
The most common forms of wheat are white and red wheat. However, other natural
forms of wheat exist. Other commercially minor but nutritionally promising
species of naturally evolved wheat species include black, yellow and blue
wheat.[6][84][85]
**** Health effects[edit] ****
Consumed worldwide by billions of people, wheat is a significant food for human
nutrition, particularly in the least_developed_countries where wheat products
are primary foods.[2][10] When eaten as the whole_grain, wheat is a healthy
food source of multiple nutrients and dietary_fiber recommended for children
and adults, in several daily servings containing a variety of foods that meet
whole grain-rich criteria.[10][74][86][87] Dietary fiber may also help people
feel full and therefore help with a healthy weight.[88] Further, wheat is a
major source for natural and biofortified nutrient supplementation, including
dietary fiber, protein and dietary minerals.[89]
Manufacturers of foods containing wheat as a whole grain in specified amounts
are allowed a health_claim for marketing purposes in the United States,
stating: "low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and
vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated
with many factors" and "diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and rich in
fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain some types of dietary
fiber, particularly soluble_fiber, may reduce the risk of heart disease, a
disease associated with many factors".[90][91] The scientific opinion of the
European_Food_Safety_Authority (EFSA) related to health claims on gut health/
bowel function, weight control, blood glucose/insulin levels, weight
management, blood cholesterol, satiety, glycaemic index, digestive function and
cardiovascular health is "that the food constituent, whole grain, (...) is not
sufficiently characterised in relation to the claimed health effects" and "that
a cause and effect relationship cannot be established between the consumption
of whole grain and the claimed effects considered in this opinion."[74][92]
*** Concerns[edit] ***
In genetically susceptible people, gluten â a major part of wheat protein â
can trigger coeliac_disease.[73][93] Coeliac disease affects about 1% of the
general population in developed_countries.[94][93] There is evidence that most
cases remain undiagnosed and untreated.[93] The only known effective treatment
is a strict lifelong gluten-free_diet.[93]
While coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to wheat proteins, it is not the
same as a wheat_allergy.[94][93] Other diseases triggered_by_eating_wheat are
non-coeliac_gluten_sensitivity,[94][15] which is estimated to affect 0.5% to
13% of the general population.[95] gluten_ataxia and dermatitis_herpetiformis.
[15]
It has been speculated that FODMAPs present in wheat (mainly fructans) are the
cause of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. As of 2019, reviews have concluded
that FODMAPs only explain certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating,
but not the extra-digestive_symptoms that people with non-coeliac gluten
sensitivity may develop, such as neurological_disorders, fibromyalgia,
psychological disturbances, and dermatitis.[96][97][98]
Other proteins present in wheat called amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) have
been identified as the possible activator of the innate_immune_system in
coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.[98][97] ATIs are part of
the plant's natural defense against insects and may cause toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)-mediated intestinal inflammation in humans.[97][99][100] These TLR4-
stimulating activities of ATIs are limited to gluten-containing cereals.[98] A
2017 study in mice demonstrated that ATIs exacerbate preexisting inflammation
and might also worsen it at extraintestinal sites. This may explain why there
is an increase of inflammation in people with preexisting diseases upon
ingestion of ATIs-containing grains.[97]
**** Comparison with other staple foods[edit] ****
The following table shows the nutrient content of wheat and other major staple
foods in a raw form.[101]
Raw forms of these staples, however, are not edible and cannot be digested.
These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked as appropriate for human
consumption. In sprouted or cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-
nutritional contents of each of these grains is remarkably different from that
of raw form of these grains reported in this table.
In cooked form, the nutrition value for each staple depends on the cooking
method (for example: baking, boiling, steaming, frying, etc.).

***** Commercial use[edit] *****
Harvested wheat grain that enters trade is classified according to grain
properties for the purposes of the commodity_markets. Wheat buyers use these to
decide which wheat to buy, as each class has special uses, and producers use
them to decide which classes of wheat will be most profitable to cultivate.
Wheat is widely cultivated as a cash_crop because it produces a good yield per
unit area, grows well in a temperate_climate even with a moderately short
growing_season, and yields a versatile, high-quality flour that is widely used
in baking. Most breads are made with wheat flour, including many breads named
for the other grains they contain, for example, most rye and oat breads. The
popularity of foods made from wheat flour creates a large demand for the grain,
even in economies with significant food surpluses.

In recent years, low international wheat prices have often encouraged farmers
in the United States to change to more profitable crops. In 1998, the price at
harvest of a 60 pounds (27 kg) bushel[103] was $2.68 per.[104] Some information
providers, following CBOT practice, quote the wheat market in per ton
denomination.[105] A USDA report revealed that in 1998, average operating costs
were $1.43 per bushel and total costs were $3.97 per bushel.[104] In that
study, farm wheat yields averaged 41.7 bushels per acre (2.2435 metric ton/
hectare), and typical total wheat production value was $31,900 per farm, with
total farm production value (including other crops) of $173,681 per farm, plus
$17,402 in government payments. There were significant profitability
differences between low- and high-cost farms, mainly due to crop yield
differences, location, and farm size.

The combine Claas_Lexion_584_06833 mows, threshes, shreds the chaff and blows

In 2016, global wheat production was 749 million tonnes.[7] Wheat is the
primary food staple in North Africa and the Middle East, and is growing in uses
in Asia. Unlike rice, wheat production is more widespread globally, though 47%
of the world total in 2014 was produced by just four countries â China,
India, Russia and the United States (table).[8]
**** Historical factors[edit] ****
In the 20th century, global wheat output expanded by about 5-fold, but until
about 1955 most of this reflected increases in wheat crop area, with lesser
(about 20%) increases in crop yields per unit area. After 1955 however, there
was a ten-fold increase in the rate of wheat yield improvement per year, and
this became the major factor allowing global wheat production to increase. Thus
technological innovation and scientific crop management with synthetic_nitrogen
fertilizer, irrigation and wheat breeding were the main drivers of wheat output
growth in the second half of the century. There were some significant decreases
in wheat crop area, for instance in North America.[106]
Better seed storage and germination ability (and hence a smaller requirement to
retain harvested crop for next year's seed) is another 20th-century
technological innovation. In Medieval England, farmers saved one-quarter of
their wheat harvest as seed for the next crop, leaving only three-quarters for
food and feed consumption. By 1999, the global average seed use of wheat was
about 6% of output.
Several factors are currently slowing the rate of global expansion of wheat
production: population growth rates are falling while wheat yields continue to
rise, and the better economic profitability of other crops such as soybeans and
maize, linked with investment in modern genetic technologies, has promoted
shifts to other crops.
**** Farming systems[edit] ****
In 2014, the most productive crop_yields for wheat were in Ireland, producing
10 tonnes per hectare.[8] In addition to gaps in farming system technology and
knowledge, some large wheat grain-producing countries have significant losses
after harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage
technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmers' inability to bring the
produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. Various studies in
India, for example, have concluded that about 10% of total wheat production is
lost at farm level, another 10% is lost because of poor storage and road
networks, and additional amounts lost at the retail level.[107]
In the Punjab_region of the Indian subcontinent, as well as North China,
irrigation has been a major contributor to increased grain output. More widely
over the last 40 years, a massive increase in fertilizer use together with the
increased availability of semi-dwarf varieties in developing countries, has
greatly increased yields per hectare.[9] In developing countries, use of
(mainly nitrogenous) fertilizer increased 25-fold in this period. However,
farming systems rely on much more than fertilizer and breeding to improve
productivity. A good illustration of this is Australian wheat growing in the
southern winter cropping zone, where, despite low rainfall (300 mm), wheat
cropping is successful even with relatively little use of nitrogenous
fertilizer. This is achieved by 'rotation cropping' (traditionally called the
ley system) with leguminous pastures and, in the last decade, including a
canola crop in the rotations has boosted wheat yields by a further 25%.[108] In
these low rainfall areas, better use of available soil-water (and better
control of soil erosion) is achieved by retaining the stubble after harvesting
and by minimizing tillage.[109]

There are substantial differences in wheat farming, trading, policy, sector
growth, and wheat uses in different regions of the world.[7] The largest
exporters of wheat in 2013 were, in order of exported quantities: United States
(33.2 million tonnes), Canada (19.8 million tonnes), France (19.6 million
tonnes), Australia (18 million tonnes), and the Russian Federation (13.8
million tonnes).[110] The largest importers of wheat in 2013 were, in order of
imported quantities: Egypt (10.3 million tonnes), Brazil (7.3 million tonnes),
Indonesia (6.7 million tonnes), Algeria (6.3 million tonnes) and Japan (6.2
million tonnes).[110]
In the rapidly developing countries of Asia and Africa, westernization of diets
associated with increasing prosperity is leading to growth in per capita demand
for wheat at the expense of the other food staples.[7][9]
In the past, there has been significant governmental intervention in wheat
markets, such as price supports in the US and farm payments in the EU. In the
EU, these subsidies have encouraged heavy use of fertilizer inputs with
resulting high crop yields. In Australia and Argentina, direct government
subsidies are much lower.[citation_needed]
**** Most productive[edit] ****
The average annual world farm yield for wheat in 2014 was 3.3 tonnes per
hectare (330 grams per square meter).[8] Ireland wheat farms were the most
productive in 2014, with a nationwide average of 10.0 tonnes per hectare,
followed by the Netherlands (9.2), and Germany, New Zealand and the United
Kingdom (each with 8.6).[8]
**** Futures contracts[edit] ****
Wheat futures are traded on the Chicago_Board_of_Trade, Kansas_City_Board_of
Trade, and Minneapolis_Grain_Exchange, and have delivery dates in March (H),
May (K), July (N), September (U), and December (Z).[111]
***** Agronomy[edit] *****

**** Crop development[edit] ****
Wheat normally needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest,
depending upon climate, seed type, and soil conditions (winter wheat lies
dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal crop management requires that the
farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the
growing plants. In particular, spring fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and
growth_regulators are typically applied only at specific stages of plant
development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second
application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage)
is about 1 cm in size (Z31 on Zadoks_scale). Knowledge of stages is also
important to identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example,
pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between anthesis and
maturity are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made
worse by water stress.[112] Farmers also benefit from knowing when the 'flag
leaf' (last leaf) appears, as this leaf represents about 75% of photosynthesis
reactions during the grain filling period, and so should be preserved from
disease or insect attacks to ensure a good yield.
Several systems exist to identify crop stages, with the Feekes and Zadoks
scales being the most widely used. Each scale is a standard system which
describes successive stages reached by the crop during the agricultural season.

***** Diseases[edit] *****
Main articles: Wheat_diseases and List_of_wheat_diseases
Rust-affected wheat seedlings
There are many wheat diseases, mainly caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses.
[113] Plant_breeding to develop new disease-resistant varieties, and sound crop
management practices are important for preventing disease. Fungicides, used to
prevent the significant crop losses from fungal disease, can be a significant
variable cost in wheat production. Estimates of the amount of wheat production
lost owing to plant diseases vary between 10â25% in Missouri.[114] A wide
range of organisms infect wheat, of which the most important are viruses and
fungi.[115]
The main wheat-disease categories are:
    * Seed-borne diseases: these include seed-borne scab, seed-borne
      Stagonospora (previously known as Septoria), common_bunt (stinking smut),
      and loose_smut. These are managed with fungicides.
    * Leaf- and head- blight diseases: Powdery mildew, leaf_rust, Septoria
      tritici leaf blotch, Stagonospora (Septoria) nodorum leaf and glume
      blotch, and Fusarium head scab.[116]
    * Crown and root_rot diseases: Two of the more important of these are
      'take-all' and Cephalosporium stripe. Both of these diseases are soil
      borne.
    * Stem rust diseases: Caused by basidiomycete fungi e.g. Ug99
    * Viral diseases: Wheat_spindle_streak_mosaic (yellow mosaic) and barley
      yellow_dwarf are the two most common viral diseases. Control can be
      achieved by using resistant varieties.
**** Pests[edit] ****
Wheat is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterfly and
moth) species including the_flame, rustic_shoulder-knot, setaceous_Hebrew
character and turnip_moth. Early in the season, many species of birds,
including the long-tailed_widowbird, and rodents feed upon wheat crops. These
animals can cause significant damage to a crop by digging up and eating newly
planted seeds or young plants. They can also damage the crop late in the season
by eating the grain from the mature spike. Recent post-harvest losses in
cereals amount to billions of dollars per year in the United States alone, and
damage to wheat by various borers, beetles and weevils is no exception.[117]
Rodents can also cause major losses during storage, and in major grain growing
regions, field mice numbers can sometimes build up explosively to plague
proportions because of the ready availability of food.[118] To reduce the
amount of wheat lost to post-harvest pests, Agricultural_Research_Service
scientists have developed an "insect-o-graph," which can detect insects in
wheat that are not visible to the naked eye. The device uses electrical signals
to detect the insects as the wheat is being milled. The new technology is so
precise that it can detect 5â10 infested seeds out of 300,000 good ones.[119]
Tracking insect infestations in stored grain is critical for food safety as
well as for the marketing value of the crop.
