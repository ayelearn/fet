Fruit preserves are preparations of fruits, vegetables and sugar, often stored
in glass jam jars.
Many varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit
preserves, such as those made from strawberry or apricot, and savory preserves,
such as those made from tomatoes or squash. The ingredients used and how they
are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are
all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the
fruit used. In English, the word, in plural form, "preserves" is used to
describe all types of jams and jellies.

***** Regional terminology[edit] *****
Jams, jellies and honeys, Minnesota_State_Fair
The term preserves is usually interchangeable with jams. Other names include:
chutney, confit, conserve, fruit butter, fruit curd, fruit spread, jelly, and
marmalade.[citation_needed]
Some cookbooks define preserves as cooked and gelled whole fruit (or
vegetable), which includes a significant portion of the fruit.[1] In the
English speaking world, the two terms are more strictly differentiated and,
when this is not the case, the more usual generic term is 'jam'.[2]
The singular preserve or conserve is used as a collective noun for high fruit
content jam, often for marketing purposes. Additionally, the name of the type
of fruit preserves will also vary depending on the regional variant of English
being used.
***** Variations[edit] *****
Five varieties of fruit preserves (clockwise from top): apple, quince, plum,
squash, orange (in the center)
**** Chutney[edit] ****
Main article: Chutney
A chutney is a relish of Indian origin made of fruit, spices and herbs.
Although originally intended to be eaten soon after production, modern chutneys
are often made to be sold, so require preservatives â often sugar and
vinegar â to ensure they have a suitable shelf life. Mango chutney, for
example, is mangoes reduced with sugar.
**** Confit[edit] ****
Main article: Confit
While confit, the past participle of the French verb confire, "to preserve", is
most often applied to preservation of meats,[3] it is also used for fruits or
vegetables seasoned and cooked with honey or sugar till jam-like.[4] Savory
confits, such as ones made with garlic or fennel, may call for a savory oil,
such as virgin olive oil, as the preserving agent.[5][6]
Konfyt (Afrikaans: "jam" or "fruit preserve"[7]) is a type of jam eaten in
Southern Africa.[clarification_needed] It is made by boiling selected fruit or
fruits (such as strawberries, apricots, oranges, lemons, water melons, berries,
peaches, prickly pears or others) and sugar, and optionally adding a small
quantity of ginger to enhance the flavour. The origins of the jam is obscure
but it is theorized that it came from the French. The word is also based on the
French term confiture via the Dutch confijt (meaning candied fruit).[8]
**** Conserve[edit] ****
Strawberry varenye (murabba)
A conserve, or whole fruit jam,[9] is a preserve made of fruit stewed in sugar.
Traditional whole fruit preserves are particularly popular in Eastern_Europe
(Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) where they are called varenye, the Baltic_region
where they're known by a native name in each of the countries (Lithuanian:
uogienÄ, Latvian: ievÄrÄ«jums, Estonian: moos, Romanian: dulceaÈÄ), as well
as in many regions of Western, Central and Southern Asia, where they are
referred to as murabba.
Often the making of conserves can be trickier than making a standard jam; it
requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for just enough
time to allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit,[10] and sugar to
penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break
down and liquify. This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar
over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the
fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only to bring to the setting
point.[9][11] As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not
particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking
for longer periods to avoid issues such as tough skins.[10] Currants_and
gooseberries, and a number of plums are among these fruits.
Because of this shorter cooking period, not as much pectin will be released
from the fruit, and as such, conserves (particularly home-made conserves) will
sometimes be slightly softer set than some jams.[11]
An alternative definition holds that conserves are preserves made from a
mixture of fruits or vegetables. Conserves may also include dried fruit or
nuts.[12]
**** Fruit butter[edit] ****
Main article: Fruit_butter
Fruit butter, in this context, refers to a process where the whole fruit is
forced through a sieve or blended after the heating process.
      "Fruit butters are generally made from larger fruits, such as apples,
      plums, peaches or grapes. Cook until softened and run through a sieve to
      give a smooth consistency. After sieving, cook the pulp ... add sugar and
      cook as rapidly as possible with constant stirring.â¦ The finished
      product should mound up when dropped from a spoon, but should not cut
      like jelly. Neither should there be any free liquid."âBerolzheimer R
      (ed) et al. (1959)[13]
**** Fruit curd[edit] ****
Main article: Fruit_curd
Fruit curd is a dessert topping and spread usually made with lemon, lime,
orange, or raspberry.[14] The basic ingredients are beaten egg yolks, sugar,
fruit juice and zest which are gently cooked together until thick and then
allowed to cool, forming a soft, smooth, intensely flavored spread. Some
recipes also include egg_whites or butter.[15]
**** Fruit spread[edit] ****
Although the FDA has Requirements for Specific Standardized Fruit Butters,
Jellies, Preserves, and Related Products,[16] there is no specification of the
meaning of the term Fruit spread. Although some assert it refers to a jam or
preserve with no added sugar,[17][18] there are many fruit spreads by leading
manufacturers that do contain added sugar. This can be easily verified by
searching the listings under fruit spread on common web sites, such as those of
Amazon or Walmart, or to look at the ingredient list[19] and nutritional
information[20] on specific fruit spread products.[21]
**** Jam[edit] ****
"Jam" redirects here. For other uses, see Jam_(disambiguation).
"Strawberry jam" redirects here. For the album, see Strawberry_Jam.
Jam typically contains both the juice and flesh of a fruit or vegetable,[22]
although one cookbook defines it as a cooked and jelled puree.[1] The term
"jam" refers to a product made of whole fruit cut into pieces or crushed, then
heated with water and sugar to activate its pectin before being put into
containers:
      "Jams are usually made from pulp and juice of one fruit, rather than a
      combination of several fruits. Berries and other small fruits are most
      frequently used, though larger fruits such as apricots, peaches, or plums
      cut into small pieces or crushed are also used for jams. Good jam has a
      soft even consistency without distinct pieces of fruit, a bright color, a
      good fruit flavor and a semi-jellied texture that is easy to spread but
      has no free liquid." â Berolzheimer R (ed) et al. (1959)[notes_1]
Pectin is mainly D-galacturonic acid connected by Î± (1â4) glycosidic
linkages. The side chains of pectin may contain small amounts of other sugars
such as L-fructose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-xylose. In jams, pectin is what
thickens the final product via cross-linking of the large polymer chains.[23]
Freezer jam is uncooked (or cooked less than 5 minutes), then stored frozen. It
is popular in parts of North America for its very fresh taste.
Recipes without added pectin use the natural pectin in the fruit to set. Tart
apples, sour blackberries, cranberries, currants, gooseberries, Concord_grapes,
soft plums, and quinces work well in recipes without added pectin.[24]
Other fruits, such as apricots, blueberries, cherries, peaches, pineapple,
raspberries, rhubarb, and strawberries are low in pectin. In order to set, or
gel, they must be combined with one of the higher pectin fruits or used with
commercially produced or homemade pectin.[25][26] Use of added pectin decreases
cooking time.
In Canada, fruit jam is categorized into two types: fruit jam and fruit jam
with pectin. Both types contain fruit, fruit_pulp or canned fruit and are
boiled with water and a sweetening ingredient. Both must have 66% water-soluble
solids. Fruit jam and fruit jam with pectin may contain a class II
preservative, a pH adjusting agent or an antifoaming_agent. Both types cannot
contain apple or rhubarb fruit.[27]
Though both types of jam are very similar, there are some differences in fruit
percent, added pectin and added acidity. Fruit jam must have at least 45% fruit
and may contain added pectin to compensate for the natural pectin level found
in the fruit. Fruit jam with pectin need only contain 27% fruit and is allowed
to contain added acidity to compensate for the natural acidity of the fruit.
[27]
Jam is created by boiling fruit, fruit pulp or canned fruit with water to and
adding a sweetening ingredient. In Canada, jam must contain at least 45% of the
named fruit and 66% water soluble solids. Jam may contain small amounts of
pectin, pectinous preparation or acid ingredients if there is a deficiency in
natural pectin. In Canada, Jam may also contain a class II preservative, a pH
adjusting agent, an antifoaming agent and cannot contain any apple or rhubarb.
[28]
**** Jelly[edit] ****
This drawing depicts a pectin molecule. These molecules combine to form the
network responsible for making jelly.
In North America, jelly (from the French gelÃ©e)[29] refers exclusively to a
clear or translucent fruit spread made from sweetened fruit (or vegetable)
juiceâthus differing from jam by excluding the fruit's fleshâand is set by
using its naturally occurring pectin, whereas outside North America jelly more
often refers to a gelatin-based_dessert,[30][31][32] though the term is also
used to refer to clear jams such as blackcurrant and apple. In the United
Kingdom, redcurrant_jelly is a condiment often served with lamb, game meat
including venison, turkey and goose in a festive or Sunday_roast. It is a clear
jam, set with pectin from the fruit, and is made in the same way, by adding the
redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining.
Pectin is essential to the formation of jelly because it acts as a gelling
agent, meaning when the pectin chains combine, they create a network that
results in a gel. The strength and effectiveness of the side chains and the
bonds they form depend on the pH of the pectin, the optimal pH is between
2.8â3.2.[33]
Additional pectin may be added where the original fruit does not supply enough,
for example with grapes.[22] Jelly can be made from sweet, savory or hot
ingredients. It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with
the additional step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating.
A muslin or stockinette "jelly bag" is traditionally used as a filter,
suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under
gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for
example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the
resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can come in a variety of flavors
such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is
typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a
peanut_butter_and_jelly_sandwich.
      "Good jelly is clear and sparkling and has a fresh flavor of the fruit
      from which it is made. It is tender enough to quiver when moved, but
      holds angles when cut... Pectin is best extracted from the fruit by heat,
      therefore cook the fruit until soft before straining to obtain the
      juice ... Pour cooked fruit into a jelly bag which has been wrung out of
      cold water. Hang up and let drain. When dripping has ceased the bag may
      be squeezed to remove remaining juice, but this may cause cloudy jelly."
      â [34][notes_2]
In Canada, the Food and Drug Regulations of the Food_and_Drugs_Act of Canada
categorizes jelly into two types: jelly, and jelly with pectin.[35] Jelly may
be made from the fruit, the fruit juice, or a fruit juice concentrate, and must
contain at least 62% water soluble solids.[36] Jelly may contain an acid
ingredient that makes up for any lack in the natural acidity of the fruit, a
chemical to adjust the pH, and/or an antifoaming_agent.[37] Jelly with pectin
must be made with a minimum of 62% water soluble solids and a minimum of 32%
juice of the named fruit, and may contain an acid ingredient that compensates
for the lack in the natural acidity of the fruit; the additional juice of
another fruit; a gelling agent; food colour; a Class II preservative (such as
benzoates, sorbates, or nitrites); a chemical to adjust the pH; and/or an
antifoaming_agent.[38]
**** Marmalade[edit] ****
Main article: Marmalade
Apple marmalade
Marmalade is a fruit preserve made from the juice and peel of citrus_fruits
boiled with sugar and water. It can be produced from lemons, limes,
grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, bergamots and other citrus fruits, or
any combination thereof. Marmalade is generally distinguished from jam by its
fruit peel.
The benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish
Seville_orange, Citrus aurantium var. aurantium, prized for its high pectin
content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which
it imparts to the preserve. In America, marmalade is sweet.
***** Production[edit] *****
Jam being made in a pot
In general, jam is produced by taking mashed or chopped fruit or vegetable pulp
and boiling it with sugar and water. The proportion of sugar and fruit varies
according to the type of fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is
equal weights of each. When the mixture reaches a temperature of 104 Â°C
(219 Â°F),[39] the acid and the pectin in the fruit react with the sugar, and
the jam will set on cooling. However, most cooks work by trial_and_error,
bringing the mixture to a "fast rolling boil", watching to see if the seething
mass changes texture, and dropping small samples on a plate to see if they run
or set.[40]
Commercially produced jams are usually produced using one of two methods. The
first is the open pan method, which is essentially a larger scale version of
the method a home jam maker would use. This gives a traditional flavor, with
some caramelization of the sugars. The second commercial process involves the
use of a vacuum vessel, where the jam is placed under a vacuum, which has the
effect of reducing its boiling temperature to anywhere between 65 and 80 Â°C
depending on the recipe and the end result desired. The lower boiling
temperature enables the water to be driven off as it would be when using the
traditional open pan method, but with the added benefit of retaining more of
the volatile flavor compounds from the fruit, preventing caramelization of the
sugars, and of course reducing the overall energy required to make the product.
However, once the desired amount of water has been driven off, the jam still
needs to be heated briefly to 95 to 100 Â°C (203 to 212 Â°F) to kill off any
micro-organisms that may be present; the vacuum pan method does not kill them
all.
During commercial filling it is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and
lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during
storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a
vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down tamper-evident safety
button when used.
***** Packaging[edit] *****
Glass or plastic jars are an efficient method of storing and preserving jam.
Though sugar can keep for exceedingly long times, containing it in a jar is far
more useful than older methods. Other methods of packaging jam, especially for
industrially produced products, include cans and plastic packets, especially
used in the food service industry for individual servings. Fruit preserves
typically are of low water_activity and can be stored at room temperature after
opening, if used within a short period of time.
***** Legal definitions[edit] *****
**** US FDA definitions[edit] ****
The U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration (FDA) published standards of identity in
21 CFR 150, and treats jam and preserves as synonymous, but distinguishes jelly
from jams and preserves. All of these are cooked and pectin-gelled fruit
products, but jellies are based entirely on fruit juice or other liquids, while
jams and preserves are gelled fruit that may include the seeds and pulp. The
United_States_Department_of_Agriculture offers grading service based on these
standards.[22]
**** Canadian regulations[edit] ****
Under the Processed Products Regulations (C.R.C., c. 291), jams, jellies,
citrus marmalade and preserves are defined. Each must contain a minimum
percentage of the named fruit and a minimum percentage of water-soluble solids.
Jams "shall be the product made by boiling fruit, fruit pulp or canned fruit to
a suitable consistency with water and a sweetening ingredient", jellies "shall
be the product made by boiling fruit juice or concentrated fruit juice that is
free from seeds and pulp with water and a sweetening ingredient until it
acquires a gelatinous consistency."[41]
**** European Union directives on jam[edit] ****
In the European_Union, the jam directive (Council Directive 79/693/EEC, 24 July
1979)[42] set minimum standards for the amount of "fruit" in jam, but the
definition of fruit was expanded to take account of several unusual kinds of
jam made in the EU. For this purpose, "fruit" is considered to include fruits
that are not usually treated in a culinary sense as fruits, such as tomatoes,
cucumbers, and pumpkins; fruits that are not normally made into jams; and
vegetables that are sometimes made into jams, such as rhubarb (the edible part
of the stalks), carrots, and sweet_potatoes. This definition continues to apply
in the new directive, Council Directive 2001/113/EC of 20 December 2001
relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut purÃ©e
intended for human consumption.[43]
Extra jam is subject to somewhat stricter rules that set higher standards for
the minimum fruit content (45% instead of 35% as a general rule, but lower for
some fruits such as redcurrants and blackcurrants), as well specifying as the
use of unconcentrated fruit pulp, and forbidding the mixture of certain fruits
and vegetables with others.[43]
Extra jelly similarly specifies that the quantity of fruit juice or aqueous
extracts used to make 1,000 grams of finished product must not be less than
that laid down for the manufacture of extra jam.[44]
