Psychometrics is a field of study concerned with the theory and technique of
psychological measurement. As defined by the US National_Council_on_Measurement
in_Education (NCME), psychometrics refers to psychological measurement.
Generally, it refers to the field in psychology and education that is devoted
to testing, measurement, assessment, and related activities.[1]
The field is concerned with the objective measurement of skills and knowledge,
abilities, attitudes, personality_traits, and educational_achievement. Some
psychometric researchers focus on the construction and validation of assessment
instruments such as questionnaires, tests, raters' judgments, and personality
tests. Others focus on research relating to measurement theory (e.g., item
response_theory; intraclass_correlation).
Practitioners are described as psychometricians. Psychometricians usually
possess a specific qualification, and most are psychologists with advanced
graduate training. In addition to traditional academic institutions, many
psychometricians work for the government or in human_resources departments.
Others specialize as learning_and_development professionals.

***** Historical foundation[edit] *****
Psychological testing has come from two streams of thought: the first, from
Darwin, Galton, and Cattell on the measurement of individual differences, and
the second, from Herbart, Weber, Fechner, and Wundt and their psychophysical
measurements of a similar construct. The second set of individuals and their
research is what has led to the development of experimental_psychology, and
standardized testing.[2]
**** Victorian stream[edit] ****
Charles Darwin was the inspiration behind Sir Francis Galton who led to the
creation of psychometrics. In 1859, Darwin published his book "The_Origin_of
Species", which pertained to individual differences in animals. This book
discussed how individual members in a species differ and how they possess
characteristics that are more adaptive and successful or less adaptive and less
successful. Those who are adaptive and successful are the ones that survive and
give way to the next generation, who would be just as or more adaptive and
successful. This idea, studied previously in animals, led to Galton's interest
and study of human beings and how they differ one from another, and more
importantly, how to measure those differences.
Galton wrote a book entitled "Hereditary Genius" about different
characteristics that people possess and how those characteristics make them
more "fit" than others. Today these differences, such as sensory and motor
functioning (reaction time, visual acuity, and physical strength) are important
domains of scientific psychology. Much of the early theoretical and applied
work in psychometrics was undertaken in an attempt to measure intelligence.
Galton, often referred to as "the father of psychometrics," devised and
included mental tests among his anthropometric measures. James McKeen Cattell,
who is considered a pioneer of psychometrics went on to extend Galton's work.
Cattell also coined the term mental test, and is responsible for the research
and knowledge which ultimately led to the development of modern tests. (Kaplan
& Saccuzzo, 2010)
**** German stream[edit] ****
The origin of psychometrics also has connections to the related field of
psychophysics. Around the same time that Darwin, Galton, and Cattell were
making their discoveries, Herbart was also interested in "unlocking the
mysteries of human consciousness" through the scientific method. (Kaplan &
Saccuzzo, 2010) Herbart was responsible for creating mathematical models of the
mind, which were influential in educational practices in years to come.
E.H. Weber built upon Herbart's work and tried to prove the existence of a
psychological threshold, saying that a minimum stimulus was necessary to
activate a sensory system. After Weber, G.T. Fechner expanded upon the
knowledge he gleaned from Herbart and Weber, to devise the law that the
strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. A
follower of Weber and Fechner, Wilhelm Wundt is credited with founding the
science of psychology. It is Wundt's influence that paved the way for others to
develop psychological testing.[2]
**** 20th century[edit] ****
The psychometrician L._L._Thurstone, founder and first president of the
Psychometric Society in 1936, developed and applied a theoretical approach to
measurement referred to as the law_of_comparative_judgment, an approach that
has close connections to the psychophysical theory of Ernst_Heinrich_Weber and
Gustav_Fechner. In addition, Spearman and Thurstone both made important
contributions to the theory and application of factor_analysis, a statistical
method developed and used extensively in psychometrics.[citation_needed] In the
late 1950s, Leopold_Szondi made an historical and epistemological assessment of
the impact of statistical thinking onto psychology during previous few decades:
"in the last decades, the specifically psychological thinking has been almost
completely suppressed and removed, and replaced by a statistical thinking.
Precisely here we see the cancer of testology and testomania of today."[3]
More recently, psychometric theory has been applied in the measurement of
personality, attitudes, and beliefs, and academic_achievement. Measurement of
these unobservable phenomena is difficult, and much of the research and
accumulated science in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to
properly define and quantify such phenomena. Critics, including practitioners
in the physical_sciences and social_activists, have argued that such definition
and quantification is impossibly difficult, and that such measurements are
often misused, such as with psychometric personality tests used in employment
procedures:
      "For example, an employer wanting someone for a role requiring consistent
      attention to repetitive detail will probably not want to give that job to
      someone who is very creative and gets bored easily."[4]
Figures who made significant contributions to psychometrics include Karl
Pearson, Henry_F._Kaiser, Carl_Brigham, L._L._Thurstone, Anne_Anastasi, Georg
Rasch, Eugene_Galanter, Johnson_O'Connor, Frederic_M._Lord, Ledyard_R_Tucker,
Arthur_Jensen, and David_Andrich.
***** Definition of measurement in the social sciences[edit] *****
The definition of measurement in the social sciences has a long history. A
currently widespread definition, proposed by Stanley_Smith_Stevens (1946), is
that measurement is "the assignment of numerals to objects or events according
to some rule." This definition was introduced in the paper in which Stevens
proposed four levels_of_measurement. Although widely adopted, this definition
differs in important respects from the more classical definition of measurement
adopted in the physical sciences, namely that scientific measurement entails
"the estimation or discovery of the ratio of some magnitude of a quantitative
attribute to a unit of the same attribute" (p. 358)[5]
Indeed, Stevens's definition of measurement was put forward in response to the
British Ferguson Committee, whose chair, A. Ferguson, was a physicist. The
committee was appointed in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement
of Science to investigate the possibility of quantitatively estimating sensory
events. Although its chair and other members were physicists, the committee
also included several psychologists. The committee's report highlighted the
importance of the definition of measurement. While Stevens's response was to
propose a new definition, which has had considerable influence in the field,
this was by no means the only response to the report. Another, notably
different, response was to accept the classical definition, as reflected in the
following statement:
      Measurement in psychology and physics are in no sense different.
      Physicists can measure when they can find the operations by which they
      may meet the necessary criteria; psychologists have but to do the same.
      They need not worry about the mysterious differences between the meaning
      of measurement in the two sciences. (Reese, 1943, p. 49)
These divergent responses are reflected in alternative approaches to
measurement. For example, methods based on covariance_matrices are typically
employed on the premise that numbers, such as raw scores derived from
assessments, are measurements. Such approaches implicitly entail Stevens's
definition of measurement, which requires only that numbers are assigned
according to some rule. The main research task, then, is generally considered
to be the discovery of associations between scores, and of factors posited to
underlie such associations.[citation_needed]
On the other hand, when measurement models such as the Rasch_model are
employed, numbers are not assigned based on a rule. Instead, in keeping with
Reese's statement above, specific criteria for measurement are stated, and the
goal is to construct procedures or operations that provide data that meet the
relevant criteria. Measurements are estimated based on the models, and tests
are conducted to ascertain whether the relevant criteria have been met.
[citation_needed]
***** Instruments and procedures[edit] *****
The first[citation_needed]psychometric instruments were designed to measure the
concept of intelligence.[6] One historical approach involved the Stanford-Binet
IQ_test, developed originally by the French psychologist Alfred_Binet.
Intelligence tests are useful tools for various purposes. An alternative
conception of intelligence is that cognitive capacities within individuals are
a manifestation of a general component, or general_intelligence_factor, as well
as cognitive capacity specific to a given domain.[citation_needed]
Another major focus in psychometrics has been on personality_testing. There
have been a range of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and measuring
personality. Some of the better known instruments include the Minnesota
Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory, the Five-Factor_Model (or "Big 5") and tools
such as Personality_and_Preference_Inventory and the Myers-Briggs_Type
Indicator. Attitudes have also been studied extensively using psychometric
approaches.[citation_needed] A common method in the measurement of attitudes is
the use of the Likert_scale. An alternative method involves the application of
unfolding measurement models, the most general being the Hyperbolic Cosine
Model (Andrich & Luo, 1993).[7]
***** Theoretical approaches[edit] *****
Psychometricians have developed a number of different measurement theories.
These include classical_test_theory (CTT) and item_response_theory (IRT).[8][9]
An approach which seems mathematically to be similar to IRT but also quite
distinctive, in terms of its origins and features, is represented by the Rasch
model for measurement. The development of the Rasch model, and the broader
class of models to which it belongs, was explicitly founded on requirements of
measurement in the physical sciences.[10]
Psychometricians have also developed methods for working with large matrices of
correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include:
factor_analysis,[11] a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data;
multidimensional_scaling,[12] a method for finding a simple representation for
data with a large number of latent dimensions; and data_clustering, an approach
to finding objects that are like each other. All these multivariate descriptive
methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More
recently, structural_equation_modeling[13] and path_analysis represent more
sophisticated approaches to working with large covariance_matrices. These
methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and
tested to determine if they are adequate fits.
One of the main deficiencies in various factor analyses is a lack of consensus
in cutting points for determining the number of latent factors. A usual
procedure is to stop factoring when eigenvalues drop below one because the
original sphere shrinks. The lack of the cutting points concerns other
multivariate methods, also.[citation_needed]
**** Key concepts[edit] ****
Key concepts in classical test theory are reliability and validity. A reliable
measure is one that measures a construct consistently across time, individuals,
and situations. A valid measure is one that measures what it is intended to
measure. Reliability is necessary, but not sufficient, for validity.
Both reliability and validity can be assessed statistically. Consistency over
repeated measures of the same test can be assessed with the Pearson correlation
coefficient, and is often called test-retest reliability.[14] Similarly, the
equivalence of different versions of the same measure can be indexed by a
Pearson_correlation, and is called equivalent forms reliability or a similar
term.[14]
Internal consistency, which addresses the homogeneity of a single test form,
may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test, which is
termed split-half reliability; the value of this Pearson_product-moment
correlation_coefficient for two half-tests is adjusted with the
SpearmanâBrown_prediction_formula to correspond to the correlation between
two full-length tests.[14] Perhaps the most commonly used index of reliability
is Cronbach's_Î±, which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half
coefficients. Other approaches include the intra-class_correlation, which is
the ratio of variance of measurements of a given target to the variance of all
targets.
There are a number of different forms of validity. Criterion-related validity
can be assessed by correlating a measure with a criterion measure theoretically
expected to be related. When the criterion measure is collected at the same
time as the measure being validated the goal is to establish concurrent
validity; when the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish
predictive_validity. A measure has construct_validity if it is related to
measures of other constructs as required by theory. Content_validity is a
demonstration that the items of a test do an adequate job of covering the
domain being measured. In a personnel selection example, test content is based
on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or
other characteristics obtained from a job_analysis.
Item_response_theory models the relationship between latent_traits and
responses to test items. Among other advantages, IRT provides a basis for
obtaining an estimate of the location of a test-taker on a given latent trait
as well as the standard error of measurement of that location. For example, a
university student's knowledge of history can be deduced from his or her score
on a university test and then be compared reliably with a high school student's
knowledge deduced from a less difficult test. Scores derived by classical test
theory do not have this characteristic, and assessment of actual ability
(rather than ability relative to other test-takers) must be assessed by
comparing scores to those of a "norm group" randomly selected from the
population. In fact, all measures derived from classical test theory are
dependent on the sample tested, while, in principle, those derived from item
response theory are not.
Many psychometricians are also concerned with finding and eliminating test bias
from their psychological tests. Test bias is a form of systematic (i.e., non-
random) error which leads to examinees from one demographic group having an
unwarranted advantage over examinees from another demographic group.[15]
According to leading experts, test bias may cause differences in average scores
across demographic groups, but differences in group scores are not sufficient
evidence that test bias is actually present because the test could be measuring
real differences among groups.[16][15] Psychometricians use sophisticated
scientific methods to search for test bias and eliminate it. Research shows
that it is usually impossible for people reading a test item to accurately
determine whether it is biased or not.[17]
***** Standards of quality[edit] *****
The considerations of validity and reliability typically are viewed as
essential elements for determining the quality of any test. However,
professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these
concerns within broader contexts when developing standards and making overall
judgments about the quality of any test as a whole within a given context. A
consideration of concern in many applied research settings is whether or not
the metric of a given psychological inventory is meaningful or arbitrary.[18]
**** Testing standards[edit] ****
In 2014, the American Educational Research Association (AERA), American
Psychological Association (APA), and National Council on Measurement in
Education (NCME) published a revision of the Standards_for_Educational_and
Psychological_Testing,[19] which describes standards for test development,
evaluation, and use. The Standards cover essential topics in testing including
validity, reliability/errors of measurement, and fairness in testing. The book
also establishes standards related to testing operations including test design
and development, scores, scales, norms, score linking, cut scores, test
administration, scoring, reporting, score interpretation, test documentation,
and rights and responsibilities of test takers and test users. Finally, the
Standards cover topics related to testing applications, including psychological
testing_and_assessment, workplace testing and credentialing, educational
testing_and_assessment, and testing in program_evaluation and public policy.
**** Evaluation standards[edit] ****
In the field of evaluation, and in particular educational_evaluation, the Joint
Committee_on_Standards_for_Educational_Evaluation[20] has published three sets
of standards for evaluations. The Personnel Evaluation Standards[21] was
published in 1988, The Program Evaluation Standards (2nd edition)[22] was
published in 1994, and The Student Evaluation Standards[23] was published in
2003.
Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a
variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for
designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of
evaluation.[24] Each of the standards has been placed in one of four
fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper,
useful, feasible, and accurate. In these sets of standards, validity and
reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. For example,
the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will
provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and
performance.
***** Non-human: animals and machines[edit] *****
Psychometrics addresses human abilities, attitudes, traits and educational
evolution. Notably, the study of behavior, mental processes and abilities of
non-human animals is usually addressed by comparative_psychology, or with a
continuum between non-human animals and the rest of animals by evolutionary
psychology. Nonetheless there are some advocators for a more gradual transition
between the approach taken for humans and the approach taken for (non-human)
animals.[25][26][27] [28]
The evaluation of abilities, traits and learning evolution of machines has been
mostly unrelated to the case of humans and non-human animals, with specific
approaches in the area of artificial_intelligence. A more integrated approach,
under the name of universal psychometrics, has also been proposed.[29]
