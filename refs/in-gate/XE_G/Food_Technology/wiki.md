Food technology is a branch of food_science that deals with the production
processes that make_foods.
Early scientific_research into food technology concentrated on food
preservation. Nicolas_Appertâs development in 1810 of the canning process was
a decisive event. The process wasnât called canning then and Appert did not
really know the principle on which his process worked, but canning has had a
major impact on food preservation techniques.
Louis_Pasteur's research on the spoilage of wine and his description of how to
avoid spoilage in 1864 was an early attempt to apply scientific knowledge to
food handling. Besides research into wine_spoilage, Pasteur researched the
production of alcohol, vinegar, wines and beer, and the souring_of_milk. He
developed pasteurizationâthe process of heating milk and milk products to
destroy food spoilage and disease-producing organisms. In his research into
food technology, Pasteur became the pioneer into bacteriology and of modern
preventive_medicine.

***** Developments[edit] *****
Freeze-dried coffee, a form of instant_coffee
Developments in food technology have contributed greatly to the food supply and
have changed our world. Some of these developments are:
    * Instantized_Milk_Powder - D.D. Peebles (U.S. patent 2,835,586) developed
      the first instant milk powder, which has become the basis for a variety
      of new products that are rehydratable. This process increases the surface
      area of the powdered product by partially rehydrating spray-dried milk
      powder.
    * Freeze-drying - The first application of freeze drying was most likely in
      the pharmaceutical industry; however, a successful large-scale industrial
      application of the process was the development of continuous freeze
      drying of coffee.
    * High-Temperature_Short_Time_Processing - These processes, for the most
      part, are characterized by rapid heating and cooling, holding for a short
      time at a relatively high temperature and filling aseptically into
      sterile containers.
    * Decaffeination of Coffee and Tea - Decaffeinated coffee and tea was first
      developed on a commercial basis in Europe around 1900. The process is
      described in U.S. patent 897,763. Green coffee beans are treated with
      water, heat and solvents to remove the caffeine from the beans.
    * Process_optimization - Food Technology now allows production of foods to
      be more efficient, Oil saving technologies are now available on different
      forms. Production methods and methodology have also become increasingly
      sophisticated.
***** Consumer acceptance[edit] *****
Historically, consumers paid little attention to food technologies. Nowadays
the food production chain is long and complicated, and foods and food
technologies are diverse. Consequently consumers are uncertain about the
determinants of food quality and safety and find it difficult to understand
them. Now, acceptance of food products very often depends on perceived benefits
and risks associated with the food. Popular views of food processing
technologies matter. Especially innovative food processing technologies often
are perceived as risky by consumers[1]
Acceptance of the different food technologies varies. While pasteurization is
well recognized and accepted, high pressure treatment and even microwaves often
are perceived as risky. Studies by the Hightech Europe project found that
traditional technologies were well accepted in contrast to innovative
technologies.[2]
Consumers form their attitude towards innovative food technologies through
three main mechanisms: First, through knowledge or beliefs about risks and
benefits correlated with the technology; second, through attitudes based on
their own experience; and third, through application of higher order values and
beliefs.[3] A number of scholars consider the risk-benefit trade-off as one of
the main determinants of consumer acceptance[4], although some researchers
place more emphasis on the role of benefit perception (rather than risk) in
consumer acceptance[5].
Rogers (2010) defines five major criteria that explain differences in the
acceptance of new technology by consumers: complexity, compatibility, relative
advantage, trialability and observability[6].
Acceptance of innovative technologies can be improved by providing non-
emotional and concise information about these new technological processes
methods. The HighTech project also suggests that written information has a
higher impact on consumers than audio-visual information.[7]
