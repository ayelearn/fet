The alkaline earth metals are six chemical_elements in group 2 of the periodic
table. They are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr),
barium (Ba), and radium (Ra).[1] The elements have very similar properties:
they are all shiny, silvery-white, somewhat reactive metals at standard
temperature_and_pressure.[2]
Structurally, they have in common an outer s- electron_shell which is full;[2]
[3][4] that is, this orbital contains its full complement of two electrons,
which these elements readily lose to form cations with charge +2, and an
oxidation_state of +2.[5]
All the discovered alkaline earth metals occur in nature, although radium
occurs only through the decay_chain of uranium and thorium and not as a
primordial element.[6] Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis
of element_120, the next potential member of the group, but they have all met
with failure.

***** Characteristics[edit] *****
**** Chemical[edit] ****
As with other groups, the members of this family show patterns in their
electronic_configuration, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends
in chemical behavior:

Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the
group. The chemistry of radium is not well-established due to its
radioactivity;[2] thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited.
The alkaline earth metals are all silver-colored and soft, and have relatively
low densities, melting_points, and boiling_points. In chemical terms, all of
the alkaline earth metals react with the halogens to form the alkaline earth
metal halides, all of which are ionic_crystalline_compounds (except for
beryllium_chloride, which is covalent). All the alkaline earth metals except
beryllium also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and, thus,
should be handled with great care. The heavier alkaline earth metals react more
vigorously than the lighter ones.[2] The alkaline earth metals have the second-
lowest first ionization_energies in their respective periods of the periodic
table[4] because of their somewhat low effective_nuclear_charges and the
ability to attain a full_outer_shell configuration by losing just two
electrons. The second ionization energy of all of the alkaline metals is also
somewhat low.[2][4]
Beryllium is an exception: It does not react with water or steam, and its
halides are covalent. If beryllium did form compounds with an ionization state
of +2, it would polarize electron clouds that are near it very strongly and
would cause extensive orbital_overlap, since beryllium has a high charge
density. All compounds that include beryllium have a covalent bond.[7] Even the
compound beryllium_fluoride, which is the most ionic beryllium compound, has a
low melting point and a low electrical conductivity when melted.[8][9][10]
All the alkaline earth metals have two electrons in their valence shell, so the
energetically preferred state of achieving a filled electron_shell is to lose
two electrons to form doubly charged positive ions.
*** Compounds and reactions[edit] ***
The alkaline earth metals all react with the halogens to form ionic halides,
such as calcium_chloride (CaCl
2), as well as reacting with oxygen to form oxides such as strontium_oxide
(SrO). Calcium, strontium, and barium react with water to produce hydrogen_gas
and their respective hydroxides, and also undergo transmetalation reactions to
exchange ligands.

*** Carbonyl complexes[edit] ***
Calcium, strontium, and barium all form octacarbonyl complexes and an 18-
electron valence shell. The compounds were characterized in frozen neon
matrices by vibrational spectroscopy and in gas phase by mass spectrometry.
Analysis of the electronic structure reveals that not only barium but also
strontium and calcium may effectively use their (n â 1)d atomic orbitals in
chemical bonding, suggesting they behave like transition metals.[15]

Of the six alkaline earth metals, beryllium, calcium, barium, and radium have
at least one naturally occurring radioisotope; magnesium and strontium do not.
Beryllium-7, beryllium-10, and calcium-41 are trace_radioisotopes; calcium-48
and barium-130 have very long half-lives and thus are primordial_radionuclides;
and all isotopes_of_radium are radioactive. Calcium-48 is the lightest nuclide
to undergo double_beta_decay.[22] Calcium and barium are weakly radioactive:
calcium contains about 0.1874% calcium-48,[23] and barium contains about
0.1062% barium-130.[24] The longest lived isotope of radium is radium-226 with
a half-life of 1600 years; it and radium-223, -224, and -228 occur naturally in
the decay_chains of primordial thorium and uranium.
***** History[edit] *****
**** Etymology[edit] ****
The alkaline earth metals are named after their oxides, the alkaline earths,
whose old-fashioned names were beryllia, magnesia, lime, strontia, and baryta.
These oxides are basic (alkaline) when combined with water. "Earth" is an old
term applied by early chemists to nonmetallic substances that are insoluble in
water and resistant to heatingâproperties shared by these oxides. The
realization that these earths were not elements but compounds is attributed to
the chemist Antoine_Lavoisier. In his TraitÃ©_ÃlÃ©mentaire_de_Chimie (Elements
of Chemistry) of 1789 he called them salt-forming earth elements. Later, he
suggested that the alkaline earths might be metal oxides, but admitted that
this was mere conjecture. In 1808, acting on Lavoisier's idea, Humphry_Davy
became the first to obtain samples of the metals by electrolysis of their
molten earths,[25] thus supporting Lavoisier's hypothesis and causing the group
to be named the alkaline earth metals.
**** Discovery[edit] ****
The calcium compounds calcite and lime have been known and used since
prehistoric times.[26] The same is true for the beryllium compounds beryl and
emerald.[27] The other compounds of the alkaline earth metals were discovered
starting in the early 15th century. The magnesium compound magnesium_sulfate
was first discovered in 1618 by a farmer at Epsom in England. Strontium
carbonate was discovered in minerals in the Scottish village of Strontian in
1790. The last element is the least abundant: radioactive radium, which was
extracted from uraninite in 1898.[28][29][30]
All elements except beryllium were isolated by electrolysis of molten
compounds. Magnesium, calcium, and strontium were first produced by Humphry
Davy in 1808, whereas beryllium was independently isolated by Friedrich_WÃ¶hler
and Antoine_Bussy in 1828 by reacting beryllium compounds with potassium. In
1910, radium was isolated as a pure metal by Curie and AndrÃ©-Louis_Debierne
also by electrolysis.[28][29][30]
*** Beryllium[edit] ***
Emerald is a form of beryl, the principal mineral of beryllium.
Beryl, a mineral that contains beryllium, has been known since the time of the
Ptolemaic_Kingdom in Egypt.[27] Although it was originally thought that beryl
was an aluminium_silicate,[31] beryl was later found to contain a then-unknown
element when, in 1797, Louis-Nicolas_Vauquelin dissolved aluminium_hydroxide
from beryl in an alkali.[32] In 1828, Friedrich_WÃ¶hler[33] and Antoine_Bussy
[34] independently isolated this new element, beryllium, by the same method,
which involved a reaction of beryllium_chloride with metallic potassium; this
reaction was not able to produce large ingots of beryllium.[35] It was not
until 1898, when Paul_Lebeau performed an electrolysis of a mixture of
beryllium_fluoride and sodium_fluoride, that large pure samples of beryllium
were produced.[35]
*** Magnesium[edit] ***
Magnesium was first produced by Sir_Humphry_Davy in England in 1808 using
electrolysis of a mixture of magnesia and mercuric_oxide.[36] Antoine_Bussy
prepared it in coherent form in 1831. Davy's first suggestion for a name was
magnium,[36] but the name magnesium is now used.
*** Calcium[edit] ***
Lime has been used as a material for building since 7000 to 14,000 BCE,[26] and
kilns_used_for_lime have been dated to 2,500 BCE in Khafaja, Mesopotamia.[37]
[38] Calcium as a material has been known since at least the first century, as
the ancient_Romans were known to have used calcium_oxide by preparing it from
lime. Calcium_sulfate has been known to be able to set broken bones since the
tenth century. Calcium itself, however, was not isolated until 1808, when
Humphry_Davy, in England, used electrolysis on a mixture of lime and mercuric
oxide,[39] after hearing that JÃ¶ns_Jakob_Berzelius had prepared a calcium
amalgam from the electrolysis of lime in mercury.
*** Strontium[edit] ***
In 1790, physician Adair_Crawford discovered ores with distinctive properties,
which were named strontites in 1793 by Thomas_Charles_Hope, a chemistry
professor at the University_of_Glasgow,[40] who confirmed Crawford's discovery.
Strontium was eventually isolated in 1808 by Sir Humphry_Davy by electrolysis
of a mixture of strontium_chloride and mercuric_oxide. The discovery was
announced by Davy on 30 June 1808 at a lecture to the Royal Society.[41]
*** Barium[edit] ***
Barite, the material that was first found to contain barium.
Barite, a mineral containing barium, was first recognized as containing a new
element in 1774 by Carl_Scheele, although he was able to isolate only barium
oxide. Barium oxide was isolated again two years later by Johan_Gottlieb_Gahn.
Later in the 18th century, William_Withering noticed a heavy mineral in the
Cumberland lead mines, which are now known to contain barium. Barium itself was
finally isolated in 1808 when Sir_Humphry_Davy used electrolysis with molten
salts, and Davy named the element barium, after baryta. Later, Robert_Bunsen
and Augustus_Matthiessen isolated pure barium by electrolysis of a mixture of
barium chloride and ammonium chloride.[42][43]
*** Radium[edit] ***
While studying uraninite, on 21 December 1898, Marie and Pierre_Curie
discovered that, even after uranium had decayed, the material created was still
radioactive. The material behaved somewhat similarly to barium_compounds,
although some properties, such as the color of the flame test and spectral
lines, were much different. They announced the discovery of a new element on 26
December 1898 to the French_Academy_of_Sciences.[44] Radium was named in 1899
from the word radius, meaning ray, as radium emitted power in the form of rays.
[45]
***** Occurrence[edit] *****
Series of alkaline earth metals.
Beryllium occurs in the earth's crust at a concentration of two to six parts
per_million (ppm),[46] much of which is in soils, where it has a concentration
of six ppm. Beryllium is one of the rarest elements in seawater, even rarer
than elements such as scandium, with a concentration of 0.2 parts per trillion.
[47][48] However, in freshwater, beryllium is somewhat more common, with a
concentration of 0.1 parts per billion.[49]
Magnesium and calcium are very common in the earth's crust, being respectively
the fifth- eighth-most-abundant elements. None of the alkaline earth metals are
found in their elemental state. Common magnesiumâcontaining minerals are
carnallite, magnesite, and dolomite. Common calcium-containing minerals are
chalk, limestone, gypsum, and anhydrite.[2]
Strontium is the fifteenth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust. The
principal minerals are celestite and strontianite.[50] Barium is slightly less
common, much of it in the mineral barite.[51]
Radium, being a decay_product of uranium, is found in all uranium-bearing ores.
[52] Due to its relatively short half-life,[53] radium from the Earth's early
history has decayed, and present-day samples have all come from the much slower
decay of uranium.[52]
***** Production[edit] *****

Emerald, a variety of beryl, is a naturally occurring compound of beryllium.
Most beryllium is extracted from beryllium hydroxide. One production method is
sintering, done by mixing beryl, sodium_fluorosilicate, and soda at high
temperatures to form sodium_fluoroberyllate, aluminium_oxide, and silicon
dioxide. A solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium_hydroxide in water is
then used to form beryllium_hydroxide by precipitation. Alternatively, in the
melt method, powdered beryl is heated to high temperature, cooled with water,
then heated again slightly in sulfuric_acid, eventually yielding beryllium
hydroxide. The beryllium hydroxide from either method then produces beryllium
fluoride and beryllium_chloride through a somewhat long process. Electrolysis
or heating of these compounds can then produce beryllium.[7]
In general, strontium carbonate is extracted from the mineral celestite through
two methods: by leaching the celestite with sodium_carbonate, or in a more
complicated way involving coal.[54]
To produce barium, barite is subjected to barium_sulfide by carbothermic
reduction. which is dissolved with other elements to form other compounds, such
as barium_nitrate. These in turn are thermally decompressed into barium_oxide,
which eventually yields pure barium after a reaction with aluminium.[51] The
most important supplier of barium is China, which produces more than 50% of
world supply.[55]
***** Applications[edit] *****
Beryllium is used mostly for military applications,[56] but there are other
uses of beryllium, as well. In electronics, beryllium is used as a p-type
dopant in some semiconductors,[57] and beryllium_oxide is used as a high-
strength electrical_insulator and heat_conductor.[58] Due to its light weight
and other properties, beryllium is also used in mechanics when stiffness, light
weight, and dimensional stability are required at wide temperature ranges.[59]
[60]
Magnesium has many uses. It offers advantages over other materials such as
aluminium, although this usage has fallen out of favor due to magnesium's
flammability.[61] Magnesium is also often alloyed with aluminium or zinc to
form materials with more desirable properties than any pure metal.[62]
Magnesium has many other uses in industrial applications, such as having a role
in the production of iron and steel, and the production of titanium.[63]
Calcium also has many uses. One of its uses is as a reducing_agent in the
separation of other metals from ore, such as uranium. It is also used in the
production of the alloys of many metals, such as aluminium and copper alloys,
and is also used to deoxidize alloys as well. Calcium also has a role in the
making of cheese, mortars, and cement.[64]
Strontium and barium do not have as many applications as the lighter alkaline
earth metals, but still have uses. Strontium_carbonate is often used in the
manufacturing of red fireworks,[65] and pure strontium is used in the study of
neurotransmitter release in neurons.[66][67] Radioactive strontium-90 finds
some use in RTGs,[68][69] which utilize its decay_heat. Barium has some use in
vacuum_tubes to remove gases,[51] and barium_sulfate has many uses in the
petroleum industry,[4] as well as other industries.[4][51][70]
Due to its radioactivity, radium no longer has many applications, but it used
to have many. Radium used to be used often in luminous_paints,[71] although
this use was stopped after workers got sick.[72] As people used to think that
radioactivity was a good thing, radium used to be added to drinking_water,
toothpaste, and many other products, although they are also not used anymore
due to their health effects.[61] Radium is no longer even used for its
radioactive properties, as there are more powerful and safer emitters than
radium.[73][74]
***** Representative reactions of alkaline earth metals[edit] *****
Reaction with halogens
      Ca + Cl2 â CaCl2
Anhydrous calcium chloride is a hygroscopic substance that is used as a
desiccant. Exposed to air, it will absorb water vapour from the air, forming a
solution. This property is known as deliquescence.

***** Identification of alkaline earth cations[edit] *****
The flame test
The table below[75] presents the colours observed when the flame of a Bunsen
burner is exposed to salts of alkaline earth metals. Be and Mg do not impart
colour to the flame due to their small size.[76]
Metal Colour
Ca    Brick-red
Sr    Crimson red
Ba    Green/Yellow
Ra    Carmine red
In solution
Mg2+
Disodium_phosphate is a very selective reagent for magnesium ions and, in the
presence of ammonium salts and ammonia, forms a white precipitate of ammonium
magnesium phosphate.
      Mg2+ + NH3 + Na2HPO4 â (NH4)MgPO4 + 2Na+
Ca2+
Ca2+ forms a white precipitate with ammonium oxalate. Calcium oxalate is
insoluble in water, but is soluble in mineral acids.
      Ca2+ + (COO)2(NH4)2 â (COO)2Ca + NH4+
Sr2+
Strontium ions precipitate with soluble sulphate salts.
      Sr2+ + Na2SO4 â SrSO4 + 2Na+
All ions of alkaline earth metals form white precipitate with ammonium
carbonate in the presence of ammonium chloride and ammonia.
***** Compounds of alkaline earth metals[edit] *****
Oxides
The alkaline earth metal oxides are formed from the thermal decomposition of
the corresponding carbonates.
      CaCO3 â CaO + CO2 (at approx. 9000C)
In laboratory, they are obtained from hydroxides:
      Mg(OH)2 â MgO + H2O
or nitrates:
      Ca(NO3)2 â CaO + 2NO + 1/2O2
The oxides exhibit basic character: they turn phenolphthalein red and litmus,
blue. They react with water to form hydroxides in an exothermic reaction.
      CaO + H2O â Ca(OH)2 + Q
Calcium oxide reacts with carbon to form acetylide.
      CaO + 3C â CaC2 + CO (at 25000)
      CaC2 + N2 â CaCN2 + C
      CaCN2 + H2SO4 â CaSO4 + H2NâCN
      H2NâCN + H2O â (H2N)CO (urea)
      CaCN2 + 2H2O â CaCO3 + NH3
Hydroxides
They are generated from the corresponding oxides on reaction with water. They
exhibit basic character: they turn phenolphthalein pink and litmus, blue.
Beryllium hydroxide is an exception as it exhibits amphoteric character.
      Be(OH)2 + 2HCl â BeCl2 + H2O
      Be(OH)2 + NaOH â Na[Be(OH)3]
Salts
Ca and Mg are found in nature in many compounds such as dolomite, aragonite,
magnesite (carbonate rocks). Calcium and magnesium ions are found in hard
water. Hard water represents a multifold issue. It is of great interest to
remove these ions, thus softening the water. This procedure can be done using
reagents such as calcium_hydroxide, sodium_carbonate or sodium_phosphate. A
more common method is to use ion-exchange aluminosilicates or ion-exchange
resins that trap Ca2+ and Mg2+ and liberate Na+ instead:
      Na2OÂ·Al2O3Â·6SiO2 + Ca2+ â CaOÂ·Al2O3Â·6SiO2 + 2Na+
***** Biological role and precautions[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (January
         2013)
Magnesium and calcium are ubiquitous and essential to all known living
organisms. They are involved in more than one role, with, for example,
magnesium or calcium ion_pumps playing a role in some cellular processes,
magnesium functioning as the active center in some enzymes, and calcium salts
taking a structural role, most notably in bones.
Strontium plays an important role in marine aquatic life, especially hard
corals, which use strontium to build their exoskeletons. It and barium have
some uses in medicine, for example "barium_meals" in radiographic imaging,
whilst strontium compounds are employed in some toothpastes. Excessive amounts
of strontium-90 are toxic due to its radioactivity and strontium-90 mimics
calcium and then can kill.
Beryllium and radium, however, are toxic. Beryllium's low aqueous solubility
means it is rarely available to biological systems; it has no known role in
living organisms and, when encountered by them, is usually highly toxic.[7]
Radium has a low availability and is highly radioactive, making it toxic to
life.
***** Extensions[edit] *****
The next alkaline earth metal after radium is thought to be element_120,
although this may not be true due to relativistic_effects.[77] The synthesis of
element 120 was first attempted in March 2007, when a team at the Flerov
Laboratory_of_Nuclear_Reactions in Dubna bombarded plutonium-244 with iron-58
ions; however, no atoms were produced, leading to a limit of 400 fb for the
cross-section at the energy studied.[78] In April 2007, a team at the GSI
attempted to create element 120 by bombarding uranium-238 with nickel-64,
although no atoms were detected, leading to a limit of 1.6 pb for the reaction.
Synthesis was again attempted at higher sensitivities, although no atoms were
detected. Other reactions have been tried, although all have been met with
failure.[79]
The chemistry of element 120 is predicted to be closer to that of calcium or
strontium[80] instead of barium or radium. This is unusual as periodic_trends
would predict element 120 to be more reactive than barium and radium. This
lowered reactivity is due to the expected energies of element 120's valence
electrons, increasing element 120's ionization_energy and decreasing the
metallic and ionic_radii.[80]
***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ Noble_gas_notation is used for conciseness; the nearest noble gas that
      precedes the element in question is written first, and then the electron
      configuration is continued from that point forward.
   2. ^ Energies are given in âkJ/mol, solubilities in mol/L; HE means
      "hydration_energy".
   3. ^ The number given in parentheses refers to the measurement_uncertainty.
      This uncertainty applies to the least_significant_figure(s) of the number
      prior to the parenthesized value (i.e., counting from rightmost digit to
      left). For instance, 1.00794(7) stands for 1.00794Â±0.00007, whereas
      1.00794(72) stands for 1.00794Â±0.00072.[16]
   4. ^ The element does not have any stable nuclides, and a value in brackets
      indicates the mass_number of the longest-lived isotope of the element.
      [17][18]
   5. ^ The color of the flame test of pure radium has never been observed; the
      crimson-red color is an extrapolation from the flame test color of its
      compounds.[21]
