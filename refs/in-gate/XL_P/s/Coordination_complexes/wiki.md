Cisplatin, PtCl2(NH3)2, is a coordination complex of platinum(II) with two
chloride and two ammonia ligands. It is one of the most successful anticancer
drugs.
In chemistry, a coordination complex consists of a central atom or ion, which
is usually metallic and is called the coordination centre, and a surrounding
array of bound molecules or ions, that are in turn known as ligands or
complexing agents.[1][2][3] Many metal-containing compounds, especially those
of transition_metals, are coordination complexes.[4] A coordination complex
whose centre is a metal atom is called a metal complex.

***** Nomenclature and terminology[edit] *****
Coordination complexes are so pervasive that their structures and reactions are
described in many ways, sometimes confusingly. The atom within a ligand that is
bonded to the central metal atom or ion is called the donor atom. In a typical
complex, a metal ion is bonded to several donor atoms, which can be the same or
different. A polydentate (multiple bonded) ligand is a molecule or ion that
bonds to the central atom through several of the ligand's atoms; ligands with
2, 3, 4 or even 6 bonds to the central atom are common. These complexes are
called chelate_complexes; the formation of such complexes is called chelation,
complexation, and coordination.
The central atom or ion, together with all ligands, comprise the coordination
sphere.[5][6] The central atoms or ion and the donor atoms comprise the first
coordination sphere.
Coordination refers to the "coordinate covalent bonds" (dipolar_bonds) between
the ligands and the central atom. Originally, a complex implied a reversible
association of molecules, atoms, or ions through such weak chemical_bonds. As
applied to coordination chemistry, this meaning has evolved. Some metal
complexes are formed virtually irreversibly and many are bound together by
bonds that are quite strong.[7][8]
The number of donor atoms attached to the central atom or ion is called the
coordination_number. The most common coordination numbers are 2, 4, and
especially 6. A hydrated ion is one kind of a complex ion (or simply a
complex), a species formed between a central metal ion and one or more
surrounding ligands, molecules or ions that contain at least one lone pair of
electrons.
If all the ligands are monodentate, then the number of donor atoms equals the
number of ligands. For example, the cobalt(II) hexahydrate ion or the
hexaaquacobalt(II) ion [Co(H2O)6]2+ is a hydrated-complex ion that consists of
six water molecules attached to a metal ion Co. The oxidation state and the
coordination number reflect the number of bonds formed between the metal ion
and the ligands in the complex ion. However, the coordination number of Pt
(en)2+
2 is 4 (rather than 2) since it has two bidentate ligands, which contain four
donor atoms in total.
Any donor atom will give a pair of electrons. There are some donor atoms or
groups which can offer more than one pair of electrons. Such are called
bidentate (offers two pairs of electrons) or polydentate (offers more than two
pairs of electrons). In some cases an atom or a group offers a pair of
electrons to two similar or different central metal atoms or acceptorsâby
division of the electron pairâinto a three-center_two-electron_bond. These
are called bridging ligands.
***** History[edit] *****
Alfred_Werner
Coordination complexes have been known since the beginning of modern chemistry.
Early well-known coordination complexes include dyes such as Prussian_blue.
Their properties were first well understood in the late 1800s, following the
1869 work of Christian_Wilhelm_Blomstrand. Blomstrand developed what has come
to be known as the complex ion chain theory. The theory claimed that the reason
coordination complexes form is because in solution, ions would be bound via
ammonia chains. He compared this effect to the way that various carbohydrate
chains form.
Following this theory, Danish scientist Sophus_Mads_JÃ¸rgensen made
improvements to it. In his version of the theory, JÃ¸rgensen claimed that when
a molecule dissociates in a solution there were two possible outcomes: the ions
would bind via the ammonia chains Blomstrand had described or the ions would
bind directly to the metal.
It was not until 1893 that the most widely accepted version of the theory today
was published by Alfred_Werner. Wernerâs work included two important changes
to the Blomstrand theory. The first was that Werner described the two different
ion possibilities in terms of location in the coordination sphere. He claimed
that if the ions were to form a chain this would occur outside of the
coordination sphere while the ions that bound directly to the metal would do so
within the coordination sphere.[9] In one of Wernerâs most important
discoveries however he disproved the majority of the chain theory. Werner was
able to discover the spatial arrangements of the ligands that were involved in
the formation of the complex hexacoordinate cobalt. His theory allows one to
understand the difference between a coordinated ligand and a charge balancing
ion in a compound, for example the chloride ion in the cobaltammine chlorides
and to explain many of the previously inexplicable isomers.
In 1914, Werner first resolved the coordination complex, called hexol, into
optical isomers, overthrowing the theory that only carbon compounds could
possess chirality.
***** Structures[edit] *****
Structure of hexol
The ions or molecules surrounding the central atom are called ligands. Ligands
are generally bound to the central atom by a coordinate_covalent_bond (donating
electrons from a lone_electron_pair into an empty metal orbital), and are said
to be coordinated to the atom. There are also organic ligands such as alkenes
whose pi_bonds can coordinate to empty metal orbitals. An example is ethene in
the complex known as Zeise's_salt, K+[PtCl3(C2H4)]â.
**** Geometry[edit] ****
In coordination chemistry, a structure is first described by its coordination
number, the number of ligands attached to the metal (more specifically, the
number of donor atoms). Usually one can count the ligands attached, but
sometimes even the counting can become ambiguous. Coordination numbers are
normally between two and nine, but large numbers of ligands are not uncommon
for the lanthanides and actinides. The number of bonds depends on the size,
charge, and electron_configuration of the metal ion and the ligands. Metal ions
may have more than one coordination number.
Typically the chemistry of transition metal complexes is dominated by
interactions between s and p molecular_orbitals of the donor-atoms in the
ligands and the d orbitals of the metal ions. The s, p, and d orbitals of the
metal can accommodate 18 electrons (see 18-Electron_rule). The maximum
coordination number for a certain metal is thus related to the electronic
configuration of the metal ion (to be more specific, the number of empty
orbitals) and to the ratio of the size of the ligands and the metal ion. Large
metals and small ligands lead to high coordination numbers, e.g. [Mo(CN)8]4â.
Small metals with large ligands lead to low coordination numbers, e.g. Pt[P
(CMe3)]2. Due to their large size, lanthanides, actinides, and early transition
metals tend to have high coordination numbers.
Different ligand structural arrangements result from the coordination number.
Most structures follow the points-on-a-sphere pattern (or, as if the central
atom were in the middle of a polyhedron where the corners of that shape are the
locations of the ligands), where orbital overlap (between ligand and metal
orbitals) and ligand-ligand repulsions tend to lead to certain regular
geometries. The most observed geometries are listed below, but there are many
cases that deviate from a regular geometry, e.g. due to the use of ligands of
different types (which results in irregular bond lengths; the coordination
atoms do not follow a points-on-a-sphere pattern), due to the size of ligands,
or due to electronic_effects (see, e.g., JahnâTeller_distortion):
    * Linear for two-coordination
    * Trigonal_planar for three-coordination
    * Tetrahedral or square_planar for four-coordination
    * Trigonal_bipyramidal for five-coordination
    * Octahedral for six-coordination
    * Pentagonal_bipyramidal for seven-coordination
    * Square_antiprismatic for eight-coordination
    * Tricapped_trigonal_prismatic for nine-coordination
The idealized descriptions of 5-, 7-, 8-, and 9- coordination are often
indistinct geometrically from alternative structures with slightly different L-
M-L (ligand-metal-ligand) angles, e.g. the difference between square pyramidal
and trigonal bipyramidal structures.[10]
    * Square_pyramidal for five-coordination[11]
    * Capped_octahedral or capped_trigonal_prismatic for seven-coordination[12]
    * Dodecahedral or bicapped_trigonal_prismatic for eight-coordination[13]
    * Capped_square_antiprismatic for nine-coordination
In systems with low d_electron_count, due to special electronic effects such as
(second-order) JahnâTeller stabilization,[14] certain geometries (in which
the coordination atoms do not follow a points-on-a-sphere pattern) are
stabilized relative to the other possibilities, e.g. for some compounds the
trigonal prismatic geometry is stabilized relative to octahedral structures for
six-coordination.
    * Bent for two-coordination
    * Trigonal_pyramidal for three-coordination
    * Trigonal_prismatic for six-coordination
**** Isomerism[edit] ****
The arrangement of the ligands is fixed for a given complex, but in some cases
it is mutable by a reaction that forms another stable isomer.
There exist many kinds of isomerism in coordination complexes, just as in many
other compounds.
*** Stereoisomerism[edit] ***
Stereoisomerism occurs with the same bonds in different orientations relative
to one another. Stereoisomerism can be further classified into:[15]
** Cisâtrans isomerism and facialâmeridional isomerism[edit] **
Cisâtrans_isomerism occurs in octahedral and square_planar complexes (but not
tetrahedral). When two ligands are adjacent they are said to be cis, when
opposite each other, trans. When three identical ligands occupy one face of an
octahedron, the isomer is said to be facial, or fac. In a fac isomer, any two
identical ligands are adjacent or cis to each other. If these three ligands and
the metal ion are in one plane, the isomer is said to be meridional, or mer. A
mer isomer can be considered as a combination of a trans and a cis, since it
contains both trans and cis pairs of identical ligands.
    * cis-[CoCl2(NH3)4]+
    * trans-[CoCl2(NH3)4]+
    * fac-[CoCl3(NH3)3]
    * mer-[CoCl3(NH3)3]
** Optical isomerism[edit] **
Optical_isomerism occurs when a molecule is not superimposable with its mirror
image. It is so called because the two isomers are each optically_active, that
is, they rotate the plane of polarized_light in opposite directions. In the
first molecule shown, the symbol Î (lambda) is used as a prefix to describe
the left-handed propeller twist formed by three bidentate ligands. The second
molecule is the mirror image of the first, with the symbol Î (delta) as a
prefix for the right-handed propeller twist. The third and fourth molecules are
a similar pair of Î and Î isomers, in this case with two bidentate ligands
and two identical monodentate ligands.[16]
    * Î-[Fe(ox)3]3â
    * Î-[Fe(ox)3]3â
    * Î-cis-[CoCl2(en)2]+
    * Î-cis-[CoCl2(en)2]+
*** Structural isomerism[edit] ***
Structural_isomerism occurs when the bonds are themselves different. There are
four types of structural isomerism: ionisation isomerism, solvate or hydrate
isomerism, linkage isomerism and coordination isomerism.
   1. Ionisation isomerism â the isomers give different ions in solution
      although they have the same composition. This type of isomerism occurs
      when the counter ion of the complex is also a potential ligand. For
      example, pentaamminebromocobalt(III) sulphate [Co(NH3)5Br]SO4 is red
      violet and in solution gives a precipitate with barium chloride,
      confirming the presence of sulphate ion, while pentaamminesulphatecobalt
      (III) bromide [Co(NH3)5SO4]Br is red and tests negative for sulphate ion
      in solution, but instead gives a precipitate of AgBr with silver nitrate.
      [17]
   2. Solvate or hydrate isomerism â the isomers have the same composition
      but differ with respect to the number of molecules of solvent that serve
      as ligand vs simply occupying sites in the crystal. Examples: [Cr
      (H2O)6]Cl3 is violet colored, [CrCl(H2O)5]Cl2Â·H2O is blue-green, and
      [CrCl2(H2O)4]ClÂ·2H2O is dark green. See water_of_crystallization.[17]
   3. Linkage_isomerism occurs with ambidentate ligands that can bind in more
      than one place. For example, NO2 is an ambidentate ligand: It can bind to
      a metal at either the N atom or an O atom.[18]
   4. Coordination isomerism â this occurs when both positive and negative
      ions of a salt are complex ions and the two isomers differ in the
      distribution of ligands between the cation and the anion. For example,
      [Co(NH3)6][Cr(CN)6] and [Cr(NH3)6][Co(CN)6].[17]
***** Electronic properties[edit] *****
Many of the properties of transition metal complexes are dictated by their
electronic structures. The electronic structure can be described by a
relatively ionic model that ascribes formal charges to the metals and ligands.
This approach is the essence of crystal_field_theory (CFT). Crystal field
theory, introduced by Hans_Bethe in 1929, gives a quantum_mechanically based
attempt at understanding complexes. But crystal field theory treats all
interactions in a complex as ionic and assumes that the ligands can be
approximated by negative point charges.
More sophisticated models embrace covalency, and this approach is described by
ligand_field_theory (LFT) and Molecular_orbital_theory (MO). Ligand field
theory, introduced in 1935 and built from molecular orbital theory, can handle
a broader range of complexes and can explain complexes in which the
interactions are covalent. The chemical applications of group_theory can aid in
the understanding of crystal or ligand field theory, by allowing simple,
symmetry based solutions to the formal equations.
Chemists tend to employ the simplest model required to predict the properties
of interest; for this reason, CFT has been a favorite for the discussions when
possible. MO and LF theories are more complicated, but provide a more realistic
perspective.
The electronic configuration of the complexes gives them some important
properties:
**** Color of transition metal complexes[edit] ****
Synthesis of copper(II)-tetraphenylporphyrin, a metal complex, from
tetraphenylporphyrin and copper(II)_acetate_monohydrate.
Transition metal complexes often have spectacular colors caused by electronic
transitions by the absorption of light. For this reason they are often applied
as pigments. Most transitions that are related to colored metal complexes are
either dâd transitions or charge_transfer_bands. In a dâd transition, an
electron in a d orbital on the metal is excited by a photon to another d
orbital of higher energy, therefore dâd transitions occur only for partially-
filled d-orbital complexes (d1â9). For complexes having d0 or d10
configuration, charge transfer is still possible even though dâd transitions
are not. A charge transfer band entails promotion of an electron from a metal-
based orbital into an empty ligand-based orbital (metal-to-ligand_charge
transfer or MLCT). The converse also occurs: excitation of an electron in a
ligand-based orbital into an empty metal-based orbital (ligand-to-metal_charge
transfer or LMCT). These phenomena can be observed with the aid of electronic
spectroscopy; also known as UV-Vis.[19] For simple compounds with high
symmetry, the dâd transitions can be assigned using TanabeâSugano_diagrams.
These assignments are gaining increased support with computational_chemistry.

**** Colors of lanthanide complexes[edit] ****
Superficially lanthanide complexes are similar to those of the transition
metals in that some are coloured. However, for the common Ln3+ ions (Ln =
lanthanide) the colors are all pale, and hardly influenced by the nature of the
ligand. The colors are due to 4f electron transitions. As the 4f orbitals in
lanthanides are âburiedâ in the xenon core and shielded from the ligand by
the 5s and 5p orbitals they are therefore not influenced by the ligands to any
great extent leading to a much smaller crystal_field splitting than in the
transition metals. The absorption spectra of an Ln3+ ion approximates to that
of the free ion where the electronic states are described by spin-orbit
coupling. This contrasts to the transition metals where the ground state is
split by the crystal field. Absorptions for Ln3+ are weak as electric dipole
transitions are parity forbidden (Laporte_Rule forbidden) but can gain
intensity due to the effect of a low-symmetry ligand field or mixing with
higher electronic states (e.g. d orbitals). Also absorption bands are extremely
sharp which contrasts with those observed for transition metals which generally
have broad bands.[20][21] This can lead to extremely unusual effects, such as
significant color changes under different forms of lighting.
**** Magnetism[edit] ****
Main article: magnetochemistry
Metal complexes that have unpaired electrons are magnetic. Considering only
monometallic complexes, unpaired electrons arise because the complex has an odd
number of electrons or because electron pairing is destabilized. Thus,
monomeric Ti(III) species have one "d-electron" and must be (para)magnetic,
regardless of the geometry or the nature of the ligands. Ti(II), with two d-
electrons, forms some complexes that have two unpaired electrons and others
with none. This effect is illustrated by the compounds TiX2[(CH3)2PCH2CH2P
(CH3)2]2: when X = Cl, the complex is paramagnetic (high-spin configuration),
whereas when X = CH3, it is diamagnetic (low-spin configuration). It is
important to realize that ligands provide an important means of adjusting the
ground_state properties.
In bi- and polymetallic complexes, in which the individual centres have an odd
number of electrons or that are high-spin, the situation is more complicated.
If there is interaction (either direct or through ligand) between the two (or
more) metal centres, the electrons may couple (antiferromagnetic_coupling,
resulting in a diamagnetic compound), or they may enhance each other
(ferromagnetic_coupling). When there is no interaction, the two (or more)
individual metal centers behave as if in two separate molecules.
**** Reactivity[edit] ****
Complexes show a variety of possible reactivities:[22]
    * Electron transfers
            A common reaction between coordination complexes involving ligands
            are inner and outer_sphere_electron_transfers. They are two
            different mechanisms of electron_transfer redox reactions, largely
            defined by the late Henry_Taube. In an inner sphere reaction, a
            ligand with two lone_electron_pairs acts as a bridging_ligand, a
            ligand to which both coordination centres can bond. Through this,
            electrons are transferred from one centre to another.
    * (Degenerate) ligand_exchange
            One important indicator of reactivity is the rate of degenerate
            exchange of ligands. For example, the rate of interchange of
            coordinate water in [M(H2O)6]n+ complexes varies over 20 orders of
            magnitude. Complexes where the ligands are released and rebound
            rapidly are classified as labile. Such labile complexes can be
            quite stable thermodynamically. Typical labile metal complexes
            either have low-charge (Na+), electrons in d-orbitals that are
            antibonding with respect to the ligands (Zn2+), or lack covalency
            (Ln3+, where Ln is any lanthanide). The lability of a metal complex
            also depends on the high-spin vs. low-spin configurations when such
            is possible. Thus, high-spin Fe(II) and Co(III) form labile
            complexes, whereas low-spin analogues are inert. Cr(III) can exist
            only in the low-spin state (quartet), which is inert because of its
            high formal oxidation state, absence of electrons in orbitals that
            are MâL antibonding, plus some "ligand field stabilization"
            associated with the d3 configuration.
    * Associative processes
            Complexes that have unfilled or half-filled orbitals often show the
            capability to react with substrates. Most substrates have a singlet
            ground-state; that is, they have lone electron pairs (e.g., water,
            amines, ethers), so these substrates need an empty orbital to be
            able to react with a metal centre. Some substrates (e.g., molecular
            oxygen) have_a_triplet_ground_state, which results that metals with
            half-filled orbitals have a tendency to react with such substrates
            (it must be said that the dioxygen molecule also has lone pairs, so
            it is also capable to react as a 'normal' Lewis base).
If the ligands around the metal are carefully chosen, the metal can aid in
(stoichiometric or catalytic) transformations of molecules or be used as a
sensor.
***** Classification[edit] *****
Metal complexes, also known as coordination compounds, include all metal
compounds, aside from metal vapors, plasmas, and alloys. The study of
"coordination chemistry" is the study of "inorganic chemistry" of all alkali
and alkaline_earth_metals, transition_metals, lanthanides, actinides, and
metalloids. Thus, coordination chemistry is the chemistry of the majority of
the periodic table. Metals and metal ions exist, in the condensed phases at
least, only surrounded by ligands.
The areas of coordination chemistry can be classified according to the nature
of the ligands, in broad terms:
    * Classical (or "Werner Complexes"): Ligands in classical coordination
      chemistry bind to metals, almost exclusively, via their lone_pairs of
      electrons residing on the main-group atoms of the ligand. Typical ligands
      are H2O, NH3, Clâ, CNâ, en. Some of the simplest members of such
      complexes are described in metal_aquo_complexes, metal_ammine_complexes,
      Examples: [Co(EDTA)]â, [Co(NH3)6]Cl3, [Fe(C2O4)3]K3
    * Organometallic Chemistry: Ligands are organic (alkenes, alkynes, alkyls)
      as well as "organic-like" ligands such as phosphines, hydride, and CO.
      Example: (C5H5)Fe(CO)2CH3
    * Bioinorganic Chemistry: Ligands are those provided by nature, especially
      including the side chains of amino acids, and many cofactors such as
      porphyrins.
      Example: hemoglobin contains heme, a porphyrin complex of iron
      Example: chlorophyll contains a porphyrin complex of magnesium
      Many natural ligands are "classical" especially including water.
    * Cluster Chemistry: Ligands are all of the above also include other metals
      as ligands.
      Example Ru3(CO)12
    * In some cases there are combinations of different fields:
      Example: [Fe4S4(Scysteinyl)4]2â, in which a cluster is embedded in a
      biologically active species.
Mineralogy, materials_science, and solid_state_chemistry â as they apply to
metal ions â are subsets of coordination chemistry in the sense that the
metals are surrounded by ligands. In many cases these ligands are oxides or
sulfides, but the metals are coordinated nonetheless, and the principles and
guidelines discussed below apply. In hydrates, at least some of the ligands are
water molecules. It is true that the focus of mineralogy, materials science,
and solid state chemistry differs from the usual focus of coordination or
inorganic chemistry. The former are concerned primarily with polymeric
structures, properties arising from a collective effects of many highly
interconnected metals. In contrast, coordination chemistry focuses on
reactivity and properties of complexes containing individual metal atoms or
small ensembles of metal atoms.
***** Nomenclature of Coordination complexes[edit] *****
The basic procedure for naming a complex:
   1. When naming a complex ion, the ligands are named before the metal ion.
   2. Write the names of the ligands in alphabetical order. (Numerical prefixes
      do not affect the order.)
          o Multiple occurring monodentate ligands receive a prefix according
            to the number of occurrences: di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, or hexa.
            Polydentate ligands (e.g., ethylenediamine, oxalate) receive bis-,
            tris-, tetrakis-, etc.
          o Anions end in o. This replaces the final 'e' when the anion ends
            with '-ide', '-ate' or '-ite', e.g. chloride becomes chlorido and
            sulfate becomes sulfato. Formerly, '-ide' was changed to '-o' (e.g.
            chloro and cyano), but this rule has been modified in the 2005
            IUPAC recommendations and the correct forms for these ligands are
            now chlorido and cyanido.[23]
          o Neutral ligands are given their usual name, with some exceptions:
            NH3 becomes ammine; H2O becomes aqua or aquo; CO becomes carbonyl;
            NO becomes nitrosyl.
   3. Write the name of the central atom/ion. If the complex is an anion, the
      central atom's name will end in -ate, and its Latin name will be used if
      available (except for mercury).
   4. The oxidation state of the central atom is to be specified (when it is
      one of several possible, or zero), and should be written as a Roman
      numeral (or 0) enclosed in parentheses.
   5. Name of the cation should be preceded by the name of anion. (if
      applicable, as in last example)
Examples:
metal     changed to
cobalt    cobaltate
aluminium aluminate
chromium  chromate
vanadium  vanadate
copper    cuprate
iron      ferrate
      [Cu(H2O)6] 2+ â hexaaquacopper(II) ion
      [NiCl4]2â â tetrachloridonickelate(II) ion (The use of chloro- was
      removed from IUPAC naming convention)[24]
      [CuCl5NH3]3â â amminepentachloridocuprate(II) ion
      [Cd(CN)2(en)2] â dicyanidobis(ethylenediamine)cadmium(II)
      [CoCl(NH3)5]SO4 â pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) sulfate
      K4[Fe(CN)6] â potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II)
The coordination number of ligands attached to more than one metal (bridging
ligands) is indicated by a subscript to the Greek symbol Î¼ placed before the
ligand name. Thus the dimer of aluminium_trichloride is described by Al2Cl4
(Î¼2-Cl)2.
Any anionic group can be electronically stabilized by any cation. An anionic
complex can be stabilised by a hydrogen cation, becoming an acidic complex
which can dissociate to release the cationic hydrogen. This kind of complex
compound has a name with "ic" added after the central metal. For example, H2[Pt
(CN)4] has the name tetracyanoplatinic (II) acid.
***** Stability constant[edit] *****
Main article: Stability_constants_of_complexes
The affinity of metal ions for ligands is described by a stability constant,
also called the formation constant, and is represented by the symbol Kf. It is
the equilibrium_constant for its assembly from the constituent metal and
ligands, and can be calculated accordingly, as in the following example for a
simple case:
      (X)Metal(aq) + (Y)Lewis Base(aq) â (Z)Complex Ion(aq)
          K  f   =    [  Complex ion   ]  Z     [  Metal ion   ]  X   [  Lewis
      base   ]  Y        {\displaystyle K_{f}={\frac {[{\text{Complex ion}}]^
      {Z}}{[{\text{Metal ion}}]^{X}[{\text{Lewis base}}]^{Y}}}}  [
      {\displaystyle K_{f}={\frac {[{\text{Complex ion}}]^{Z}}{[{\text{Metal
      ion}}]^{X}[{\text{Lewis base}}]^{Y}}}}]
where X, Y, and Z are the stoichiometric coefficients of each species.
Formation constants vary widely. Large values indicate that the metal has high
affinity for the ligand, provided the system is at equilibrium.[25]
Sometimes the stability constant will be in a different form known as the
constant of destability. This constant is expressed as the inverse of the
constant of formation and is denoted as Kd = 1/Kf .[26] This constant
represents the reverse reaction for the decomposition of a complex ion into its
individual metal and ligand components. When comparing the values for Kd, the
larger the value, the more unstable the complex ion is.
As a result of these complex ions forming in solutions they also can play a key
role in solubility of other compounds. When a complex ion is formed it can
alter the concentrations of its components in the solution. For example:
      Ag+
      (aq) + 2NH4OH(aq) â Ag(NH3)+
      2 + H2O
      AgCl(s) + H2O(l) â Ag+
      (aq) + Clâ
      (aq)
If these reactions both occurred in the same reaction vessel, the solubility of
the silver chloride would be increased by the presence of NH4OH because
formation of the Diammine argentum(I) complex consumes a significant portion of
the free silver ions from the solution. By Le_Chatelier's_principle, this
causes the equilibrium reaction for the dissolving of the silver chloride,
which has silver ion as a product, to shift to the right.
This new solubility can be calculated given the values of Kf and Ksp for the
original reactions. The solubility is found essentially by combining the two
separate equilibria into one combined equilibrium reaction and this combined
reaction is the one that determines the new solubility. So Kc, the new
solubility constant, is denoted by:
          K  c   =  K  s p   &#x2217;  K  f     {\displaystyle K_{c}=K_{sp}*K_
      {f}}  [{\displaystyle K_{c}=K_{sp}*K_{f}}]

***** Application of coordination compounds[edit] *****
Metals only exist in solution as coordination complexes, it follows then that
this class of compounds is useful in a wide variety of ways.
**** Bioinorganic chemistry[edit] ****
In bioinorganic_chemistry and bioorganometallic_chemistry, coordination
complexes serve either structural or catalytic functions. An estimated 30% of
proteins contain metal ions. Examples include the intensely colored vitamin
B12, the heme_group in hemoglobin, the cytochromes, the chlorin_group in
chlorophyll, and carboxypeptidase, a hydrolytic enzyme important in digestion.
Another complex ion enzyme is catalase, which decomposes the cell's waste
hydrogen_peroxide.
**** Industry[edit] ****
Homogeneous_catalysis is a major application of coordination compounds for the
production of organic substances. Processes include hydrogenation,
hydroformylation, oxidation. In one example, a combination of titanium
trichloride and triethylaluminium gives rise to ZieglerâNatta_catalysts, used
for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene to give polymers of great
commercial importance as fibers, films, and plastics.
Nickel, cobalt, and copper can be extracted using hydrometallurgical_processes
involving complex ions. They are extracted from their ores as ammine complexes.
Metals can also be separated using the selective precipitation and solubility
of complex ions. Cyanide is used chiefly for extraction of gold and silver from
their ores.
Phthalocyanine complexes are an important class of pigments.
**** Analysis[edit] ****
At one time, coordination compounds were used to identify the presence of
metals in a sample. Qualitative_inorganic_analysis has largely been superseded
by instrumental methods of analysis such as atomic_absorption_spectroscopy
(AAS), inductively_coupled_plasma_atomic_emission_spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and
inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry (ICP-MS).
