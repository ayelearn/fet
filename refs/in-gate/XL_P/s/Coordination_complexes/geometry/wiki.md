projective_geometry
Geometry (from the Ancient_Greek: Î³ÎµÏÎ¼ÎµÏÏÎ¯Î±; geo- "earth", -metron
"measurement") is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape,
size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A
mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.
Geometry arose independently in a number of early cultures as a practical way
for dealing with lengths, areas, and volumes. Geometry began to see elements of
formal mathematical_science emerging in the West as early as the 6th century
BC.[1] By the 3rd century BC, geometry was put into an axiomatic_form by
Euclid, whose treatment, Euclid's_Elements, set a standard for many centuries
to follow.[2] Geometry arose independently in India, with texts providing rules
for geometric constructions appearing as early as the 3rd century BC.[3]
Islamic scientists preserved Greek ideas and expanded on them during the Middle
Ages.[4] By the early 17th century, geometry had been put on a solid analytic
footing by mathematicians such as RenÃ©_Descartes and Pierre_de_Fermat. Since
then, and into modern times, geometry has expanded into non-Euclidean_geometry
and manifolds, describing spaces that lie beyond the normal range of human
experience.[5]
While geometry has evolved significantly throughout the years, there are some
general concepts that are more or less fundamental to geometry. These include
the concepts of points, lines, planes, surfaces, angles, and curves, as well as
the more advanced notions of manifolds and topology or metric.[6]
Geometry has applications to many fields, including art, architecture, physics,
as well as to other branches of mathematics.

***** Overview *****
Contemporary geometry has many subfields:
    * Euclidean_geometry is geometry in its classical sense. The mandatory
      educational curriculum of the majority of nations includes the study of
      points, lines, planes, angles, triangles, congruence, similarity, solid
      figures, circles, and analytic_geometry.[7] Euclidean geometry also has
      applications in computer_science, crystallography, and various branches
      of modern mathematics.
    * Differential_geometry uses techniques of calculus and linear_algebra to
      study problems in geometry. It has applications in physics, including in
      general_relativity.
    * Topology is the field concerned with the properties of geometric objects
      that are unchanged by continuous_mappings. In practice, this often means
      dealing with large-scale properties of spaces, such as connectedness and
      compactness.
    * Convex_geometry investigates convex shapes in the Euclidean space and its
      more abstract analogues, often using techniques of real_analysis. It has
      close connections to convex_analysis, optimization and functional
      analysis and important applications in number_theory.
    * Algebraic_geometry studies geometry through the use of multivariate
      polynomials and other algebraic techniques. It has applications in many
      areas, including cryptography and string_theory.
    * Discrete_geometry is concerned mainly with questions of relative position
      of simple geometric objects, such as points, lines and circles. It shares
      many methods and principles with combinatorics.
    * Computational_geometry deals with algorithms and their implementations
      for manipulating geometrical objects. Although being a young area of
      geometry, it has many applications in computer_vision, image_processing,
      computer-aided_design, medical_imaging, etc.
***** History *****
Main article: History_of_geometry
A European and an Arab practicing geometry in the 15th century.
The earliest recorded beginnings of geometry can be traced to ancient
Mesopotamia and Egypt in the 2nd millennium BC.[8][9] Early geometry was a
collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles,
areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in
surveying, construction, astronomy, and various crafts. The earliest known
texts on geometry are the Egyptian Rhind_Papyrus (2000â1800 BC) and Moscow
Papyrus (c. 1890 BC), the Babylonian_clay_tablets such as Plimpton_322 (1900
BC). For example, the Moscow Papyrus gives a formula for calculating the volume
of a truncated pyramid, or frustum.[10] Later clay tablets (350â50 BC)
demonstrate that Babylonian astronomers implemented trapezoid procedures for
computing Jupiter's position and motion within time-velocity space. These
geometric procedures anticipated the Oxford_Calculators, including the mean
speed_theorem, by 14 centuries.[11] South of Egypt the ancient_Nubians
established a system of geometry including early versions of sun clocks.[12]
[13]
In the 7th century BC, the Greek mathematician Thales_of_Miletus used geometry
to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance
of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive
reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales'_Theorem.
[1] Pythagoras established the Pythagorean_School, which is credited with the
first proof of the Pythagorean_theorem,[14] though the statement of the theorem
has a long history.[15][16] Eudoxus (408âc. 355 BC) developed the method_of
exhaustion, which allowed the calculation of areas and volumes of curvilinear
figures,[17] as well as a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of
incommensurable_magnitudes, which enabled subsequent geometers to make
significant advances. Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid,
whose Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook
of all time,[18] introduced mathematical_rigor through the axiomatic_method and
is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of
definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the
Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent
logical framework.[19] The Elements was known to all educated people in the
West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in
geometry classes today.[20] Archimedes (c. 287â212 BC) of Syracuse used the
method_of_exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the
summation_of_an_infinite_series, and gave remarkably accurate approximations of
Pi.[21] He also studied the spiral bearing his name and obtained formulas for
the volumes of surfaces_of_revolution.

translation of Euclid's_Elements, (c. 1310)
Indian mathematicians also made many important contributions in geometry. The
Satapatha_Brahmana (3rd century BC) contains rules for ritual geometric
constructions that are similar to the Sulba_Sutras.[3] According to (Hayashi
2005, p. 363), the Åulba SÅ«tras contain "the earliest extant verbal
expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already
been known to the Old Babylonians. They contain lists of Pythagorean_triples,
[22] which are particular cases of Diophantine_equations.[23] In the Bakhshali
manuscript, there is a handful of geometric problems (including problems about
volumes of irregular solids). The Bakhshali manuscript also "employs a decimal
place value system with a dot for zero."[24] Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya (499)
includes the computation of areas and volumes. Brahmagupta wrote his
astronomical work BrÄhma_Sphuá¹­a_SiddhÄnta in 628. Chapter 12, containing 66
Sanskrit verses, was divided into two sections: "basic operations" (including
cube roots, fractions, ratio and proportion, and barter) and "practical
mathematics" (including mixture, mathematical series, plane figures, stacking
bricks, sawing of timber, and piling of grain).[25] In the latter section, he
stated his famous theorem on the diagonals of a cyclic_quadrilateral. Chapter
12 also included a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral (a
generalization of Heron's_formula), as well as a complete description of
rational_triangles (i.e. triangles with rational sides and rational areas).[25]
In the Middle_Ages, mathematics_in_medieval_Islam contributed to the
development of geometry, especially algebraic_geometry.[26][27] Al-Mahani (b.
853) conceived the idea of reducing geometrical problems such as duplicating
the cube to problems in algebra.[28] ThÄbit_ibn_Qurra (known as Thebit in
Latin) (836â901) dealt with arithmetic operations applied to ratios of
geometrical quantities, and contributed to the development of analytic
geometry.[4] Omar_KhayyÃ¡m (1048â1131) found geometric solutions to cubic
equations.[29] The theorems of Ibn_al-Haytham (Alhazen), Omar Khayyam and Nasir
al-Din_al-Tusi on quadrilaterals, including the Lambert_quadrilateral and
Saccheri_quadrilateral, were early results in hyperbolic_geometry, and along
with their alternative postulates, such as Playfair's_axiom, these works had a
considerable influence on the development of non-Euclidean geometry among later
European geometers, including Witelo (c. 1230âc. 1314), Gersonides
(1288â1344), Alfonso, John_Wallis, and Giovanni_Girolamo_Saccheri.[30]
In the early 17th century, there were two important developments in geometry.
The first was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with coordinates
and equations, by RenÃ©_Descartes (1596â1650) and Pierre_de_Fermat
(1601â1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of calculus
and a precise quantitative science of physics. The second geometric development
of this period was the systematic study of projective_geometry by Girard
Desargues (1591â1661). Projective geometry is a geometry without measurement
or parallel lines, just the study of how points are related to each other.
Two developments in geometry in the 19th century changed the way it had been
studied previously. These were the discovery of non-Euclidean_geometries by
Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, JÃ¡nos Bolyai and Carl Friedrich Gauss and of
the formulation of symmetry as the central consideration in the Erlangen
Programme of Felix_Klein (which generalized the Euclidean and non-Euclidean
geometries). Two of the master geometers of the time were Bernhard_Riemann
(1826â1866), working primarily with tools from mathematical_analysis, and
introducing the Riemann_surface, and Henri_PoincarÃ©, the founder of algebraic
topology and the geometric theory of dynamical_systems. As a consequence of
these major changes in the conception of geometry, the concept of "space"
became something rich and varied, and the natural background for theories as
different as complex_analysis and classical_mechanics.
***** Important concepts in geometry *****
The following are some of the most important concepts in geometry.[6][7]
**** Axioms ****
An illustration of Euclid's parallel_postulate
See also: Euclidean_geometry
Euclid took an abstract approach to geometry in his Elements, one of the most
influential books ever written. Euclid introduced certain axioms, or
postulates, expressing primary or self-evident properties of points, lines, and
planes. He proceeded to rigorously deduce other properties by mathematical
reasoning. The characteristic feature of Euclid's approach to geometry was its
rigor, and it has come to be known as axiomatic or synthetic geometry. At the
start of the 19th century, the discovery of non-Euclidean_geometries by Nikolai
Ivanovich_Lobachevsky (1792â1856), JÃ¡nos_Bolyai (1802â1860), Carl
Friedrich_Gauss (1777â1855) and others led to a revival of interest in this
discipline, and in the 20th century, David_Hilbert (1862â1943) employed
axiomatic reasoning in an attempt to provide a modern foundation of geometry.
**** Points ****
Main article: Point_(geometry)
Points are considered fundamental objects in Euclidean geometry. They have been
defined in a variety of ways, including Euclid's definition as 'that which has
no part'[31] and through the use of algebra or nested sets.[32] In many areas
of geometry, such as analytic geometry, differential geometry, and topology,
all objects are considered to be built up from points. However, there has been
some study of geometry without reference to points.[33]
**** Lines ****
Main article: Line_(geometry)
Euclid described a line as "breadthless length" which "lies equally with
respect to the points on itself".[31] In modern mathematics, given the
multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the
geometry is described. For instance, in analytic_geometry, a line in the plane
is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear
equation,[34] but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence_geometry, a
line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on
it.[35] In differential geometry, a geodesic is a generalization of the notion
of a line to curved_spaces.[36]
**** Planes ****
Main article: Plane_(geometry)
A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far.[31]
Planes are used in every area of geometry. For instance, planes can be studied
as a topological_surface without reference to distances or angles;[37] it can
be studied as an affine_space, where collinearity and ratios can be studied but
not distances;[38] it can be studied as the complex_plane using techniques of
complex_analysis;[39] and so on.
**** Angles ****
Main article: Angle
Euclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of
two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each
other.[31] In modern terms, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called
the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the
angle.[40]
Acute (a), obtuse (b), and straight (c) angles. The acute and obtuse angles are
also known as oblique angles.
In Euclidean_geometry, angles are used to study polygons and triangles, as well
as forming an object of study in their own right.[31] The study of the angles
of a triangle or of angles in a unit_circle forms the basis of trigonometry.
[41]
In differential_geometry and calculus, the angles between plane_curves or space
curves or surfaces can be calculated using the derivative.[42][43]
**** Curves ****
Main article: Curve_(geometry)
A curve is a 1-dimensional object that may be straight (like a line) or not;
curves in 2-dimensional space are called plane_curves and those in 3-
dimensional space are called space_curves.[44]
In topology, a curve is defined by a function from an interval of the real
numbers to another space.[37] In differential geometry, the same definition is
used, but the defining function is required to be differentiable [45] Algebraic
geometry studies algebraic_curves, which are defined as algebraic_varieties of
dimension one.[46]
**** Surfaces ****
Main article: Surface_(mathematics)
A sphere is a surface that can be defined parametrically (by x = r sin Î¸ cos
Ï, y = r sin Î¸ sin Ï, z = r cos Î¸) or implicitly (by x2 + y2 + z2 â r2 =
0.)
A surface is a two-dimensional object, such as a sphere or paraboloid.[47] In
differential_geometry[45] and topology,[37] surfaces are described by two-
dimensional 'patches' (or neighborhoods) that are assembled by diffeomorphisms
or homeomorphisms, respectively. In algebraic geometry, surfaces are described
by polynomial_equations.[46]
**** Manifolds ****
Main article: Manifold
A manifold is a generalization of the concepts of curve and surface. In
topology, a manifold is a topological_space where every point has a
neighborhood that is homeomorphic to Euclidean space.[37] In differential
geometry, a differentiable_manifold is a space where each neighborhood is
diffeomorphic to Euclidean space.[45]
Manifolds are used extensively in physics, including in general_relativity and
string_theory[48]
**** Topologies and metrics ****
Main article: Topology
Visual checking of the Pythagorean_theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle as in the
Zhoubi_Suanjing 500â200 BC. The Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the
Euclidean_metric.
A topology is a mathematical structure on a set that tells how elements of the
set relate spatially to each other.[37] The best-known examples of topologies
come from metrics, which are ways of measuring distances between points.[49]
For instance, the Euclidean_metric measures the distance between points in the
Euclidean_plane, while the hyperbolic_metric measures the distance in the
hyperbolic_plane. Other important examples of metrics include the Lorentz
metric of special_relativity and the semi-Riemannian_metrics of general
relativity.[50]
**** Compass and straightedge constructions ****
Main article: Compass_and_straightedge_constructions
Classical geometers paid special attention to constructing geometric objects
that had been described in some other way. Classically, the only instruments
allowed in geometric constructions are the compass and straightedge. Also,
every construction had to be complete in a finite number of steps. However,
some problems turned out to be difficult or impossible to solve by these means
alone, and ingenious constructions using parabolas and other curves, as well as
mechanical devices, were found.
**** Dimension ****
Main article: Dimension
The Koch_snowflake, with fractal_dimension=log4/log3 and topological
dimension=1
Where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a line), 2 (a plane) and 3
(our ambient world conceived of as three-dimensional_space), mathematicians
have used higher_dimensions for nearly two centuries. The concept of dimension
has gone through stages of being any natural_number n, to being possibly
infinite with the introduction of Hilbert_space, to being any positive real
number in fractal_geometry. Dimension_theory is a technical area, initially
within general_topology, that discusses definitions; in common with most
mathematical ideas, dimension is now defined rather than an intuition.
Connected topological_manifolds have a well-defined dimension; this is a
theorem (invariance_of_domain) rather than anything a priori.
The issue of dimension still matters to geometry as many classic questions
still lack complete answers. For instance, many open problems in topology
depend on the dimension of an object for the result. In physics, dimensions 3
of space and 4 of space-time are special cases in geometric_topology, and
dimensions 10 and 11 are key ideas in string_theory. Currently, the existence
of the theoretical dimensions is purely defined by technical reasons; it is
likely that further research may result in a geometric reason for the
significance of 10 or 11 dimensions in the theory, lending credibility or
possibly disproving string theory.
**** Symmetry ****
Main article: Symmetry
A tiling of the hyperbolic_plane
The theme of symmetry in geometry is nearly as old as the science of geometry
itself. Symmetric shapes such as the circle, regular_polygons and platonic
solids held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were
investigated in detail before the time of Euclid. Symmetric patterns occur in
nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the
graphics of M.C._Escher. Nonetheless, it was not until the second half of 19th
century that the unifying role of symmetry in foundations of geometry was
recognized. Felix_Klein's Erlangen_program proclaimed that, in a very precise
sense, symmetry, expressed via the notion of a transformation group, determines
what geometry is. Symmetry in classical Euclidean_geometry is represented by
congruences and rigid motions, whereas in projective_geometry an analogous role
is played by collineations, geometric_transformations that take straight lines
into straight lines. However it was in the new geometries of Bolyai and
Lobachevsky, Riemann, Clifford and Klein, and Sophus_Lie that Klein's idea to
'define a geometry via its symmetry_group' proved most influential. Both
discrete and continuous symmetries play prominent roles in geometry, the former
in topology and geometric_group_theory, the latter in Lie_theory and Riemannian
geometry.
A different type of symmetry is the principle of duality in projective_geometry
(see Duality_(projective_geometry)) among other fields. This meta-phenomenon
can roughly be described as follows: in any theorem, exchange point with plane,
join with meet, lies in with contains, and you will get an equally true
theorem. A similar and closely related form of duality exists between a vector
space and its dual space.
**** Non-Euclidean geometry ****
Differential_geometry uses tools from calculus to study problems involving
curvature.
In the nearly two thousand years since Euclid, while the range of geometrical
questions asked and answered inevitably expanded, the basic understanding of
space remained essentially the same. Immanuel_Kant argued that there is only
one, absolute, geometry, which is known to be true a priori by an inner faculty
of mind: Euclidean geometry was synthetic_a_priori.[51] This dominant view was
overturned by the revolutionary discovery of non-Euclidean_geometry in the
works of Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Gauss (who never published his theory). They
demonstrated that ordinary Euclidean_space is only one possibility for
development of geometry. A broad vision of the subject of geometry was then
expressed by Riemann in his 1867 inauguration lecture Ãber die Hypothesen,
welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen (On the hypotheses on which geometry is
based),[52] published only after his death. Riemann's new idea of space proved
crucial in Einstein's general_relativity_theory, and Riemannian_geometry, that
considers very general spaces in which the notion of length is defined, is a
mainstay of modern geometry.
***** Contemporary geometry *****
**** Euclidean geometry ****
Geometry lessons in the 20th century
Euclidean_geometry has become closely connected with computational_geometry,
computer_graphics, convex_geometry, incidence_geometry, finite_geometry,
discrete_geometry, and some areas of combinatorics. Attention was given to
further work on Euclidean geometry and the Euclidean groups by crystallography
and the work of H._S._M._Coxeter, and can be seen in theories of Coxeter_groups
and polytopes. Geometric_group_theory is an expanding area of the theory of
more general discrete_groups, drawing on geometric models and algebraic
techniques.
**** Differential geometry ****
Differential_geometry has been of increasing importance to mathematical_physics
due to Einstein's general_relativity postulation that the universe is curved.
Contemporary differential geometry is intrinsic, meaning that the spaces it
considers are smooth_manifolds whose geometric structure is governed by a
Riemannian_metric, which determines how distances are measured near each point,
and not a priori parts of some ambient flat Euclidean space.
**** Topology and geometry ****
A thickening of the trefoil_knot
The field of topology, which saw massive development in the 20th century, is in
a technical sense a type of transformation_geometry, in which transformations
are homeomorphisms. This has often been expressed in the form of the dictum
'topology is rubber-sheet geometry'. Contemporary geometric_topology and
differential_topology, and particular subfields such as Morse_theory, would be
counted by most mathematicians as part of geometry. Algebraic_topology and
general_topology have gone their own ways.[citation_needed][dubious  – discuss]
**** Algebraic geometry ****
Quintic CalabiâYau_threefold
The field of algebraic_geometry is the modern incarnation of the Cartesian
geometry of co-ordinates. From late 1950s through mid-1970s it had undergone
major foundational development, largely due to work of Jean-Pierre_Serre and
Alexander_Grothendieck. This led to the introduction of schemes and greater
emphasis on topological methods, including various cohomology_theories. One of
seven Millennium_Prize_problems, the Hodge_conjecture, is a question in
algebraic geometry.
The study of low-dimensional algebraic varieties, algebraic_curves, algebraic
surfaces and algebraic varieties of dimension 3 ("algebraic threefolds"), has
been far advanced. GrÃ¶bner_basis theory and real_algebraic_geometry are among
more applied subfields of modern algebraic geometry. Arithmetic_geometry is an
active field combining algebraic geometry and number_theory. Other directions
of research involve moduli_spaces and complex_geometry. Algebro-geometric
methods are commonly applied in string and brane theory.
***** Applications *****
Geometry has found applications in many fields, some of which are described
below.
**** Art ****
Main article: Mathematics_and_art
Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. For instance, the theory
of perspective showed that there is more to geometry than just the metric
properties of figures: perspective is the origin of projective_geometry.
**** Architecture ****
Main articles: Mathematics_and_architecture and Architectural_geometry
Mathematics and architecture are related, since, as with other arts, architects
use mathematics for several reasons. Apart from the mathematics needed when
engineering buildings, architects use geometry: to define the spatial form of a
building; from the Pythagoreans of the sixth century BC onwards, to create
forms considered harmonious, and thus to lay out buildings and their
surroundings according to mathematical, aesthetic and sometimes religious
principles; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as
tessellations; and to meet environmental goals, such as to minimise wind speeds
around the bases of tall buildings.
**** Physics ****
Main article: Mathematical_physics
The 421polytope, orthogonally projected into the E8 Lie_group Coxeter_plane.
Lie groups have several applications in physics.
The field of astronomy, especially as it relates to mapping the positions of
stars and planets on the celestial_sphere and describing the relationship
between movements of celestial bodies, have served as an important source of
geometric problems throughout history.
Modern geometry has many ties to physics as is exemplified by the links between
pseudo-Riemannian geometry and general_relativity. One of the youngest physical
theories, string_theory, is also very geometric in flavour.
**** Other fields of mathematics ****
Geometry has also had a large effect on other areas of mathematics. For
instance, the introduction of coordinates by RenÃ©_Descartes and the concurrent
developments of algebra marked a new stage for geometry, since geometric
figures such as plane_curves could now be represented analytically in the form
of functions and equations. This played a key role in the emergence of
infinitesimal_calculus in the 17th century. The subject of geometry was further
enriched by the study of the intrinsic structure of geometric objects that
originated with Euler and Gauss and led to the creation of topology and
differential_geometry.
The Pythagoreans discovered that the sides of a triangle could have
incommensurable lengths.
An important area of application is number_theory. In ancient_Greece the
Pythagoreans considered the role of numbers in geometry. However, the discovery
of incommensurable lengths, which contradicted their philosophical views, made
them abandon abstract numbers in favor of concrete geometric quantities, such
as length and area of figures. Since the 19th century, geometry has been used
for solving problems in number theory, for example through the geometry_of
numbers or, more recently, scheme_theory, which is used in Wiles's_proof_of
Fermat's_Last_Theorem.
While the visual nature of geometry makes it initially more accessible than
other mathematical areas such as algebra or number_theory, geometric language
is also used in contexts far removed from its traditional, Euclidean provenance
(for example, in fractal_geometry and algebraic_geometry).[53]
Analytic_geometry applies methods of algebra to geometric questions, typically
by relating geometric curves to algebraic equations. These ideas played a key
role in the development of calculus in the 17th century and led to the
discovery of many new properties of plane curves. Modern algebraic_geometry
considers similar questions on a vastly more abstract level.
Leonhard_Euler, in studying problems like the Seven_Bridges_of_KÃ¶nigsberg,
considered the most fundamental properties of geometric figures based solely on
shape, independent of their metric properties. Euler called this new branch of
geometry geometria situs (geometry of place), but it is now known as topology.
Topology grew out of geometry, but turned into a large independent discipline.
It does not differentiate between objects that can be continuously deformed
into each other. The objects may nevertheless retain some geometry, as in the
case of hyperbolic_knots.

  28. ^ Pythagorean triples are triples of integers     ( a , b , c )
      {\displaystyle (a,b,c)}  [(a,b,c)] with the property:      a  2   +  b  2
      =  c  2     {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}  [a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}]. Thus,
      3  2   +  4  2   =  5  2     {\displaystyle 3^{2}+4^{2}=5^{2}}  [3^{2}+4^
      {2}=5^{2}],      8  2   +  15  2   =  17  2     {\displaystyle 8^{2}+15^
      {2}=17^{2}}  [8^{2}+15^{2}=17^{2}],      12  2   +  35  2   =  37  2
      {\displaystyle 12^{2}+35^{2}=37^{2}}  [12^{2}+35^{2}=37^{2}] etc.
  29. ^ (Cooke_2005, p. 198): "The arithmetic content of the Åulva SÅ«tras
      consists of rules for finding Pythagorean triples such as (3, 4, 5), (5,
      12, 13), (8, 15, 17), and (12, 35, 37). It is not certain what practical
      use these arithmetic rules had. The best conjecture is that they were
      part of religious ritual. A Hindu home was required to have three fires
      burning at three different altars. The three altars were to be of
      different shapes, but all three were to have the same area. These
      conditions led to certain "Diophantine" problems, a particular case of
      which is the generation of Pythagorean triples, so as to make one square
      integer equal to the sum of two others."

      pp. 241â242. Omar Khayyam (c. 1050â1123), the "tent-maker," wrote an
      Algebra that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of
      third degree. Like his Arab predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided for
      quadratic equations both arithmetic and geometric solutions; for general
      cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the 16th century later
      showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence he gave only
      geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve
      cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazan, but
      Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to
      cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). .. For
      equations of higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently did not
      envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain more than
      three dimensions, ... One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic
      eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and
      geometric algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later
      with Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he
      wrote, "Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has
      thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra
      and geometry are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts
      which are proved."

           Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam, and al-Tusi, had
           made the most considerable contribution to this branch of
           geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only
           in the 19th century. In essence, their propositions concerning
           the properties of quadrangles which they considered, assuming
           that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse,
           embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the
           elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various
           geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate
           V. It is extremely important that these scholars established
           the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the
           angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the
           theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly
           influenced the relevant investigations of their European
           counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate
           on parallel lines â made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of
           the 13th century, while revising Ibn al-Haytham's Book_of
           Optics (Kitab al-Manazir) â was undoubtedly prompted by
           Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the 14th century by
           the Jewish scholar Levi ben Gerson, who lived in southern
           France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly
           border on Ibn al-Haytham's demonstration. Above, we have
           demonstrated that Pseudo-Tusi's Exposition of Euclid had
           stimulated both J. Wallis's and G. Saccheri's studies of the
           theory of parallel lines.

      perspective, these objects are just finite sets of points, but by
      invoking powerful geometric imagery and using well developed geometric
