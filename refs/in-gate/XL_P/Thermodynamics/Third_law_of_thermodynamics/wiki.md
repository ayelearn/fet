The Third law_of_thermodynamics is sometimes stated as follows, regarding the
properties of closed systems in thermodynamic_equilibrium:
     The Entropy of a system approaches a constant value as its
     temperature approaches absolute_zero.
This constant value cannot depend on any other parameters characterizing the
closed system, such as pressure or applied magnetic field. At absolute zero
(zero kelvin) the system must be in a state with the minimum possible energy.
Entropy is related to the number of accessible microstates, and there is
typically one unique state (called the ground_state) with minimum energy.[1] In
such a case, the entropy at absolute zero will be exactly zero. If the system
does not have a well-defined order (if its order is glassy, for example), then
there may remain some finite entropy as the system is brought to very low
temperatures, either because the system becomes locked into a configuration
with non-minimal energy or because the minimum energy state is non-unique. The
constant value is called the residual_entropy of the system.[2] The entropy is
essentially a state-function meaning the inherent value of different atoms,
molecules, and other configurations of particles including subatomic or atomic
material is defined by entropy, which can be discovered near 0 K. The
NernstâSimon statement of the third law of thermodynamics concerns
thermodynamic processes at a fixed, low temperature:
     The entropy change associated with any condensed system undergoing a
     reversible isothermal process approaches zero as the temperature at
     which it is performed approaches 0 K.
Here a condensed system refers to liquids and solids. A classical formulation
by Nernst (actually a consequence of the Third Law) is:
     It is impossible for any process, no matter how idealized, to reduce
     the entropy of a system to its absolute-zero value in a finite number
     of operations.[3]
There also exists a formulation of the Third Law which approaches the subject
by postulating a specific energy behavior:
     If the composite of two thermodynamic systems constitutes an isolated
     system, then any energy exchange in any form between those two
     systems is bounded.[4]

***** History[edit] *****
The third law was developed by chemist Walther_Nernst during the years
1906â12, and is therefore often referred to as Nernst's theorem or Nernst's
postulate. The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system
at absolute_zero is a well-defined constant. This is because a system at zero
temperature exists in its ground_state, so that its entropy is determined only
by the degeneracy of the ground state.
In 1912 Nernst stated the law thus: "It is impossible for any procedure to lead
to the isotherm T = 0 in a finite number of steps."[5]
An alternative version of the third law of thermodynamics as stated by Gilbert
N._Lewis and Merle_Randall in 1923:
      If the entropy of each element in some (perfect) crystalline state be
      taken as zero at the absolute zero of temperature, every substance has a
      finite positive entropy; but at the absolute zero of temperature the
      entropy may become zero, and does so become in the case of perfect
      crystalline substances.
This version states not only ÎS will reach zero at 0 K, but S itself will also
reach zero as long as the crystal has a ground state with only one
configuration. Some crystals form defects which cause a residual entropy. This
residual entropy disappears when the kinetic barriers to transitioning to one
ground state are overcome.[6]
With the development of statistical_mechanics, the third law of thermodynamics
(like the other laws) changed from a fundamental law (justified by experiments)
to a derived law (derived from even more basic laws). The basic law from which
it is primarily derived is the statistical-mechanics definition of entropy for
a large system:
         S &#x2212;  S  0   =  k  B   ln  &#x03A9; &#xA0;   {\displaystyle S-S_
      {0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln \,\Omega \ }  [{\displaystyle S-S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln
      \,\Omega \ }]
where S is entropy, kB is the Boltzmann_constant, and     &#x03A9;
{\displaystyle \Omega }  [\Omega ] is the number of microstates consistent with
the macroscopic configuration. The counting of states is from the reference
state of absolute zero, which corresponds to the entropy of S0.
***** Explanation[edit] *****
In simple terms, the third law states that the entropy of a perfect crystal of
a pure substance approaches zero as the temperature approaches zero. The
alignment of a perfect crystal leaves no ambiguity as to the location and
orientation of each part of the crystal. As the energy of the crystal is
reduced, the vibrations of the individual atoms are reduced to nothing, and the
crystal becomes the same everywhere.
a) Single possible configuration for a system at absolute zero, i.e., only one
microstate is accessible. Thus S = k ln W = 0. b) At temperatures greater than
absolute zero, multiple microstates are accessible due to atomic vibration
(exaggerated in the figure). Since the number of accessible microstates is
greater than 1, S = k ln W > 0.
The third law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of
entropy at any other temperature. The entropy of a closed system, determined
relative to this zero point, is then the absolute entropy of that system.
Mathematically, the absolute entropy of any system at zero temperature is the
natural log of the number of ground states times Boltzmann's_constant kB =
1.38Ã10â23 J Kâ1.
The entropy of a perfect crystal lattice as defined by Nernst's theorem is zero
provided that its ground state is unique, because ln(1) = 0. If the system is
composed of one-billion atoms, all alike, and lie within the matrix of a
perfect crystal, the number of combinations of one-billion identical things
taken one-billion at a time is Î© = 1. Hence:
         S &#x2212;  S  0   =  k  B   ln &#x2061; &#x03A9; =  k  B   ln
      &#x2061;  1  = 0   {\displaystyle S-S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln \Omega =k_
      {\text{B}}\ln {1}=0}  [{\displaystyle S-S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln \Omega =k_
      {\text{B}}\ln {1}=0}]
The difference is zero, hence the initial entropy S0 can be any selected value
so long as all other such calculations include that as the initial entropy. As
a result, the initial entropy value of zero is selected S0 = 0 is used for
convenience.
         S &#x2212;  S  0   = S &#x2212; 0 = 0   {\displaystyle S-S_{0}=S-0=0}
      [S-S_{0}=S-0=0]
         S = 0   {\displaystyle S=0}  [S=0]
**** Example : Entropy change of a crystal lattice heated by an incoming photon
[edit] ****
Suppose a system consisting of a crystal lattice with volume V of N identical
atoms at T= 0 K, and an incoming photon of wavelength Î» and energy Îµ.
Initially, there is only one accessible microstate :
    S  0   =  k  B   ln &#x2061; &#x03A9; =  k  B   ln &#x2061;  1  = 0
{\displaystyle S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln \Omega =k_{\text{B}}\ln {1}=0}  [
{\displaystyle S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln \Omega =k_{\text{B}}\ln {1}=0}] .
Let's assume the crystal lattice absorbs the incoming photon. There is a unique
atom in the lattice that interacts and absorbs this photon. So after
absorption, there is N possible microstates accessible by the system, each of
the microstates corresponding to one excited atom, and the other atoms
remaining at ground state.
The entropy, energy, and temperature of the closed system rises and can be
calculated. The entropy change is:
   &#x0394; S = S &#x2212;  S  0   =  k  B   ln &#x2061;  &#x03A9;
{\displaystyle \Delta S=S-S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln {\Omega }}  [{\displaystyle
\Delta S=S-S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln {\Omega }}]
From the second law of thermodynamics:
   &#x0394; S = S &#x2212;  S  0   =    &#x03B4; Q  T     {\displaystyle \Delta
S=S-S_{0}={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}}  [\Delta S = S - S_0 = \frac{\delta Q}{T} ]
Hence:
   &#x0394; S = S &#x2212;  S  0   =  k  B   ln &#x2061; ( &#x03A9; ) =
&#x03B4; Q  T     {\displaystyle \Delta S=S-S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln(\Omega )=
{\frac {\delta Q}{T}}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta S=S-S_{0}=k_{\text{B}}\ln(\Omega
)={\frac {\delta Q}{T}}}]
Calculating entropy change:
   S &#x2212; 0 =  k  B   ln &#x2061;  N  = 1.38 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 23
&#x00D7; ln &#x2061;  ( 3 &#x00D7;  10  22   )  = 70 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 23
J     K   &#x2212; 1     {\displaystyle S-0=k_{\text{B}}\ln {N}=1.38\times 10^

\ln {(3\times 10^{22})}=70\times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm {J} \,\mathrm {K} ^{-1}}]
We assume N = 3.1022 and Î» = 1 cm . The energy change of the system as a
result of absorbing the single photon whose energy is Îµ:
   &#x03B4; Q = &#x03F5; =    h c  &#x03BB;   =    6.62 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212;

0.01   m     = 2 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 23     J    {\displaystyle \delta
Q=\epsilon ={\frac {hc}{\lambda }}={\frac {6.62\times 10^{-34}\,\mathrm {J}

{0.01\,\mathrm {m} }}=2\times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm {J} }  [ \delta Q = \epsilon =

\times 3 \times 10^{8} \,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.01 \,\mathrm{m}}=2
\times 10^{-23} \,\mathrm{J}]
The temperature of the closed system rises by:
   T =   &#x03F5;  &#x0394; S    =    2 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 23     J    70
&#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 23     J     K   &#x2212; 1      = 0.02857 K
{\displaystyle T={\frac {\epsilon }{\Delta S}}={\frac {2\times 10^{-
23}\,\mathrm {J} }{70\times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm {J} \,\mathrm {K} ^{-
1}}}=0.02857K}  [{\displaystyle T={\frac {\epsilon }{\Delta S}}={\frac {2\times
10^{-23}\,\mathrm {J} }{70\times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm {J} \,\mathrm {K} ^{-
1}}}=0.02857K}]
This can be interpreted as the average temperature of the system over the range
from     0 < S < 70 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 23     J     K   &#x2212; 1
{\displaystyle 0<S<70\times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm {J} \,\mathrm {K} ^{-1}}  [
{\displaystyle 0<S<70\times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm {J} \,\mathrm {K} ^{-1}}][7]. A
single atom was assumed to absorb the photon but the temperature and entropy
change characterizes the entire system.
**** Systems with non-zero entropy at absolute zero[edit] ****
An example of a system which does not have a unique ground state is one whose
net spin is a half-integer, for which time-reversal_symmetry gives two
degenerate ground states. For such systems, the entropy at zero temperature is
at least kB*ln(2) (which is negligible on a macroscopic scale). Some
crystalline systems exhibit geometrical_frustration, where the structure of the
crystal lattice prevents the emergence of a unique ground state. Ground-state
helium (unless under pressure) remains liquid.
In addition, glasses and solid solutions retain large entropy at 0 K, because
they are large collections of nearly degenerate states, in which they become
trapped out of equilibrium. Another example of a solid with many nearly-
degenerate ground states, trapped out of equilibrium, is ice_Ih, which has
"proton_disorder".
For the entropy at absolute zero to be zero, the magnetic moments of a
perfectly ordered crystal must themselves be perfectly ordered; from an
entropic perspective, this can be considered to be part of the definition of a
"perfect crystal". Only ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and diamagnetic
materials can satisfy this condition. However, ferromagnetic materials do not,
in fact, have zero entropy at zero temperature, because the spins of the
unpaired electrons are all aligned and this gives a ground-state spin
degeneracy. Materials that remain paramagnetic at 0 K, by contrast, may have
many nearly-degenerate ground states (for example, in a spin_glass), or may
retain dynamic disorder (a quantum_spin_liquid).[citation_needed]
***** Consequences[edit] *****
Fig. 1 Left side: Absolute zero can be reached in a finite number of steps if S
(0,X1)â S(0, X2). Right: An infinite number of steps is needed since S(0,X1)=
S(0,X2).
**** Absolute zero[edit] ****
The third law is equivalent to the statement that
      It is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce the
      temperature of any closed system to zero temperature in a finite number
      of finite operations.[8]
The reason that T = 0 cannot be reached according to the third law is explained
as follows: Suppose that the temperature of a substance can be reduced in an
isentropic process by changing the parameter X from X2 to X1. One can think of
a multistage nuclear_demagnetization setup where a magnetic field is switched
on and off in a controlled way.[9] If there were an entropy difference at
absolute zero, T = 0 could be reached in a finite number of steps. However, at
T = 0 there is no entropy difference so an infinite number of steps would be
needed. The process is illustrated in Fig. 1.
**** Specific heat[edit] ****
A non-quantitative description of his third law that Nernst gave at the very
beginning was simply that the specific heat can always be made zero by cooling
the material down far enough.[10] A modern, quantitative analysis follows.
Supposed that the heat capacity of a sample in the low temperature region has
the form of a power law C(T,X)=C0TÎ± asymptotically as Tâ0, and we wish to
find which values of Î± are compatible with the third law. We have
    &#x222B;   T  0     T      C (  T  &#x2032;   , X )   T  &#x2032;
d  T  &#x2032;   =    C  0   &#x03B1;   (  T  &#x03B1;   &#x2212;  T  0
&#x03B1;   ) .   {\displaystyle \int _{T_{0}}^{T}{\frac {C(T^{\prime },X)} (11)
{T^{\prime }}}dT^{\prime }={\frac {C_{0}}{\alpha }}(T^{\alpha }-T_{0}^
{\alpha }).}  [\int_{T_0}^T \frac {C(T^\prime,X)}{T^\prime}dT^\prime =
\frac {C_0}{ \alpha}(T^{ \alpha}-T_0^{ \alpha}).]
By the discussion of third law (above), this integral must be bounded as
T0â0, which is only possible if Î±>0. So the heat capacity must go to zero at
absolute zero
    lim  T &#x2192; 0   C ( T , X ) = 0.   {\displaystyle \lim _ (12)
{T\rightarrow 0}C(T,X)=0.}  [ \lim_{T \rightarrow 0}C(T,X)=0.]
if it has the form of a power law. The same argument shows that it cannot be
bounded below by a positive constant, even if we drop the power-law assumption.
On the other hand, the molar specific heat at constant volume of a monatomic
classical ideal gas, such as helium at room temperature, is given by CV=(3/2)R
with R the molar ideal gas constant. But clearly a constant heat capacity does
not satisfy Eq. (12). That is, a gas with a constant heat capacity all the way
to absolute zero violates the third law of thermodynamics. We can verify this
more fundamentally by substituting CV in Eq. (14), which yields
   S ( T , V ) = S (  T  0   , V ) +   3 2   R ln &#x2061;   T  T  0     .
{\displaystyle S(T,V)=S(T_{0},V)+{\frac {3}{2}}R\ln {\frac {T}{T_{0}}}.}   (13)
[S(T,V) = S(T_0,V) + \frac{3}{2}R \ln \frac{T}{T_0}.]
In the limit T0 â 0 this expression diverges, again contradicting the third
law of thermodynamics.
The conflict is resolved as follows: At a certain temperature the quantum
nature of matter starts to dominate the behavior. Fermi particles follow
FermiâDirac_statistics and Bose particles follow BoseâEinstein_statistics.
In both cases the heat capacity at low temperatures is no longer temperature
independent, even for ideal gases. For Fermi gases
    C  V   =    &#x03C0;  2   2   R   T  T  F       {\displaystyle C_{V}=
{\frac {\pi ^{2}}{2}}R{\frac {T}{T_{\text{F}}}}}  [{\displaystyle C_{V}=  (14)
{\frac {\pi ^{2}}{2}}R{\frac {T}{T_{\text{F}}}}}]
with the Fermi temperature TF given by
    T  F   =   1  8  &#x03C0;  2          N  A   2    h  2     M R
(    3  &#x03C0;  2    N  A     V  m     )   2  /  3   .   {\displaystyle
T_{\text{F}}={\frac {1}{8\pi ^{2}}}{\frac {N_{\text{A}}^{2}h^{2}}
{MR}}\left({\frac {3\pi ^{2}N_{\text{A}}}{V_{\text{m}}}}\right)^{2/3}.}  [ (15)
{\displaystyle T_{\text{F}}={\frac {1}{8\pi ^{2}}}{\frac {N_{\text{A}}^
{2}h^{2}}{MR}}\left({\frac {3\pi ^{2}N_{\text{A}}}{V_{\text{m}}}}\right)^
{2/3}.}]
Here NA is Avogadro's number, Vm the molar volume, and M the molar mass.
For Bose gases
    C  V   = 1.93.. R   (   T  T  B     )   3  /  2     {\displaystyle C_
{V}=1.93..R\left({\frac {T}{T_{\text{B}}}}\right)^{3/2}}  [{\displaystyle (16)
C_{V}=1.93..R\left({\frac {T}{T_{\text{B}}}}\right)^{3/2}}]
with TB given by
    T  B   =   1 11.9..       N  A   2    h  2     M R      (    N  A    V
m     )   2  /  3   .   {\displaystyle T_{\text{B}}={\frac {1}{11.9..}}
{\frac {N_{\text{A}}^{2}h^{2}}{MR}}\left({\frac {N_{\text{A}}}{V_{\text    (17)
{m}}}}\right)^{2/3}.}  [{\displaystyle T_{\text{B}}={\frac {1}{11.9..}}
{\frac {N_{\text{A}}^{2}h^{2}}{MR}}\left({\frac {N_{\text{A}}}{V_{\text
{m}}}}\right)^{2/3}.}]
The specific heats given by Eq. (14) and (16) both satisfy Eq. (12). Indeed,
they are power laws with Î±=1 and Î±=3/2 respectively.
Even within a purely classical setting, the density of a classical ideal gas at
fixed particle number becomes arbitrarily high as T goes to zero, so the
interparticle spacing goes to zero. The assumption of non-interacting particles
presumably breaks down when they are sufficiently close together, so the value
of      C  V     {\displaystyle C_{V}}  [C_{V}] gets modified away from its
ideal constant value.
**** Vapor pressure[edit] ****
The only liquids near absolute zero are Â³He and â´He. Their heat of
evaporation has a limiting value given by
   L =  L  0   +  C  p   T   {\displaystyle L=L_{0}+C_{p}T}  [L=L_0+C_pT] (18)
with L0 and Cp constant. If we consider a container, partly filled with liquid
and partly gas, the entropy of the liquidâgas mixture is
   S ( T , x ) =  S  l   ( T ) + x (    L  0   T   +  C  p   )
{\displaystyle S(T,x)=S_{l}(T)+x({\frac {L_{0}}{T}}+C_{p})}  [S(T,x) = S_l (19)
(T)+x(\frac{L_0}{T}+C_p)]
where Sl(T) is the entropy of the liquid and x is the gas fraction. Clearly the
entropy change during the liquidâgas transition (x from 0 to 1) diverges in
the limit of Tâ0. This violates Eq.(8). Nature solves this paradox as
follows: at temperatures below about 50 mK the vapor pressure is so low that
the gas density is lower than the best vacuum in the universe. In other words:
below 50 mK there is simply no gas above the liquid.
**** Latent heat of melting[edit] ****
The melting curves of Â³He and â´He both extend down to absolute zero at
finite pressure. At the melting pressure, liquid and solid are in equilibrium.
The third law demands that the entropies of the solid and liquid are equal at
T=0. As a result, the latent heat of melting is zero and the slope of the
melting curve extrapolates to zero as a result of the ClausiusâClapeyron
equation.
**** Thermal expansion coefficient[edit] ****
The thermal expansion coefficient is defined as
    &#x03B1;  V   =   1  V  m       (    &#x2202;  V  m     &#x2202; T
)   p   .   {\displaystyle \alpha _{V}={\frac {1}{V_{m}}}\left({\frac      (20)
{\partial V_{m}}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}.}  [{\displaystyle \alpha _{V}=
{\frac {1}{V_{m}}}\left({\frac {\partial V_{m}}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}.}]
With the Maxwell_relation
     (    &#x2202;  V  m     &#x2202; T    )   p   = &#x2212;
(    &#x2202;  S  m     &#x2202; p    )   T     {\displaystyle \left(
{\frac {\partial V_{m}}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}=-\left({\frac {\partial S_ (21)
{m}}{\partial p}}\right)_{T}}  [{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial V_
{m}}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}=-\left({\frac {\partial S_{m}}{\partial
p}}\right)_{T}}]
and Eq. (8) with X=p it is shown that
    lim  T &#x2192; 0    &#x03B1;  V   = 0.   {\displaystyle \lim _  (22)
{T\rightarrow 0}\alpha _{V}=0.}  [\lim_{T \rightarrow 0}\alpha_V=0.]
So the thermal expansion coefficient of all materials must go to zero at zero
kelvin.
