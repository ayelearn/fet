In chemistry and atomic_physics, the electron affinity (Eea) of an atom or
molecule is defined as the amount of energy released or spent when an electron
is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative
ion.[1]
            X + eÃ¢ÂˆÂ’ Ã¢Â†Â’ XÃ¢ÂˆÂ’ + energy
In solid_state_physics, the electron affinity for a surface is defined somewhat
differently (see below).

***** Measurement and use of electron affinity[edit] *****
This property is used to measure atoms and molecules in the gaseous state only,
since in a solid or liquid state their energy_levels would be changed by
contact with other atoms or molecules. A list of the electron affinities was
used by Robert_S._Mulliken to develop an electronegativity scale for atoms,
equal to the average of the electron affinity and ionization_potential.[2][3]
Other theoretical concepts that use electron affinity include electronic
chemical potential and chemical_hardness. Another example, a molecule or atom
that has a more positive value of electron affinity than another is often
called an electron_acceptor and the less positive an electron_donor. Together
they may undergo charge-transfer reactions.
**** Sign convention[edit] ****
To use electron affinities properly, it is essential to keep track of sign. For
any reaction that releases energy, the change ÃÂ”E in total_energy has a
negative value and the reaction is called an exothermic_process. Electron
capture for almost all non-noble_gas atoms involves the release of energy[4]
and thus are exothermic. The positive values that are listed in tables of Eea
are amounts or magnitudes. It is the word, released within the definition
energy released that supplies the negative sign to ÃÂ”E. Confusion arises in
mistaking Eea for a change in energy, ÃÂ”E, in which case the positive values
listed in tables would be for an endo- not exo-thermic process. The relation
between the two is Eea = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ÃÂ”E(attach).
However, if the value assigned to Eea is negative, the negative sign implies a
reversal of direction, and energy is required to attach an electron. In this
case, the electron capture is an endothermic process and the relationship, Eea
= Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ÃÂ”E(attach) is still valid. Negative values typically arise for the
capture of a second electron, but also for the nitrogen atom.
The usual expression for calculating Eea when an electron is attached is
            Eea = (EinitialÂ Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â Efinal)attach = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ÃÂ”E(attach)
This expression does follow the convention ÃÂ”X = X(final) Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ X(initial) since
Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ÃÂ”E = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’(E(final) Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ E(initial)) = E(initial) Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ E(final).
Equivalently, electron affinity can also be defined as the amount of energy
required to detach an electron from the atom while it holds a single-excess-
electron thus making the atom a negative_ion,[1] i.e. the energy change for the
process
            XÃ¢ÂˆÂ’ Ã¢Â†Â’ X + eÃ¢ÂˆÂ’
If the same table is employed for the forward and reverse reactions, without
switching signs, care must be taken to apply the correct definition to the
corresponding direction, attachment (release) or detachment (require). Since
almost all detachments (require +) an amount of energy listed on the table,
those detachment reactions are endothermic, or ÃÂ”E(detach) > 0.
            Eea = (Efinal Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ Einitial)detach = ÃÂ”E(detach) = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ÃÂ”E(attach).
***** Electron affinities of the elements[edit] *****
Electron affinity (Eea) vs atomic number (Z). Note the sign convention
explanation in the previous section.
Main article: Electron_affinity_(data_page)
Although Eea varies greatly across the periodic table, some patterns emerge.
Generally, nonmetals have more positive Eea than metals. Atoms whose anions are
more stable than neutral atoms have a greater Eea. Chlorine most strongly
attracts extra electrons; neon most weakly attracts an extra electron. The
electron affinities of the noble gases have not been conclusively measured, so
they may or may not have slightly negative values.
Eea generally increases across a period (row) in the periodic table prior to
reaching group 18. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the
atom; a group_17 atom releases more energy than a group_1 atom on gaining an
electron because it obtains a filled valence_shell and therefore is more
stable. In group 18, the valence shell is full, meaning that added electrons
are unstable, tending to be ejected very quickly.
Counterintuitively, Eea does not decrease when progressing down the rows of the
periodic table, as can be clearly seen in the group_2 data. Thus, electron
affinity follows the same "left-right" trend as electronegativity, but not the
"up-down" trend.

***** Molecular electron affinities[edit] *****
The electron affinity of molecules is a complicated function of their
electronic structure. For instance the electron affinity for benzene is
negative, as is that of naphthalene, while those of anthracene, phenanthrene
and pyrene are positive. In_silico experiments show that the electron affinity
of hexacyanobenzene surpasses that of fullerene.[5]
***** "Electron affinity" as defined in solid state physics[edit] *****
Band_diagram of semiconductor-vacuum interface showing electron affinity EEA,
defined as the difference between near-surface vacuum energy Evac, and near-
surface conduction_band edge EC. Also shown: Fermi_level EF, valence_band edge
EV, work_function W.
In the field of solid_state_physics, the electron affinity is defined
differently than in chemistry and atomic physics. For a semiconductor-vacuum
interface (that is, the surface of a semiconductor), electron affinity,
typically denoted by EEA or ÃÂ‡, is defined as the energy obtained by moving an
electron from the vacuum just outside the semiconductor to the bottom of the
conduction_band just inside the semiconductor:[6]
          E   E A    &#x2261;  E   v a c    &#x2212;  E   C      {\displaystyle
      E_{\rm {EA}}\equiv E_{\rm {vac}}-E_{\rm {C}}}  [E_{\rm {EA}}\equiv E_{\rm
      {vac}}-E_{\rm {C}}]
In an intrinsic semiconductor at absolute_zero, this concept is functionally
analogous to the chemistry definition of electron affinity, since an added
electron will spontaneously go to the bottom of the conduction band. At nonzero
temperature, and for other materials (metals, semimetals, heavily doped
semiconductors), the analogy does not hold since an added electron will instead
go to the Fermi_level on average. In any case, the value of the electron
affinity of a solid substance is very different from the chemistry and atomic
physics electron affinity value for an atom of the same substance in gas phase.
For example, a silicon crystal surface has electron affinity 4.05Â eV, whereas
an isolated silicon atom has electron affinity 1.39Â eV.
The electron affinity of a surface is closely related to, but distinct from,
its work_function. The work function is the thermodynamic_work that can be
obtained by reversibly, isothermally moving an electron from the vacuum to the
material; this thermodynamic electron goes to the Fermi_level on average, not
the conduction band edge:     W =  E   v a c    &#x2212;  E   F
{\displaystyle W=E_{\rm {vac}}-E_{\rm {F}}}  [W=E_{\rm {vac}}-E_{\rm {F}}].
While the work_function of a semiconductor can be changed by doping, the
electron affinity ideally does not change with doping and so it is closer to
being a material constant. However, like work function the electron affinity
does depend on the surface termination (crystal face, surface chemistry, etc.)
and is strictly a surface property.
In semiconductor physics, the primary use of the electron affinity is not
actually in the analysis of semiconductorÃ¢Â€Â“vacuum surfaces, but rather in
heuristic electron_affinity_rules for estimating the band_bending that occurs
at the interface of two materials, in particular metalÃ¢Â€Â“semiconductor
junctions and semiconductor heterojunctions.
In certain circumstances, the electron affinity may become negative.[7] Often
negative electron affinity is desired to obtain efficient cathodes that can
supply electrons to the vacuum with little energy loss. The observed electron
yield as a function of various parameters such as bias voltage or illumination
conditions can be used to describe these structures with band_diagrams in which
the electron affinity is one parameter. For one illustration of the apparent
effect of surface termination on electron emission, see Figure 3 in Marchywka
Effect.
