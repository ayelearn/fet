Periodic trends for ionization energy (Ei) vs. atomic_number: note that within
each of the seven periods the Ei (colored circles) of an element begins at a
minimum for the first column of the periodic table (the alkali metals), and
progresses to a maximum for the last column (the noble gases) which are
indicated by vertical lines and labelled with a noble gas element symbol, and
which also serve as lines dividing the 7 periods. The maximum ionization energy
for each row diminishes as one progresses from row 1 to row 7 in a given
column, due to the increasing distance of the outer electron shell from the
nucleus as inner shells are added.
In physics and chemistry, ionization energy (American_English spelling) or
ionisation energy (British_English spelling), denoted Ei, is the minimum amount
of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron, the valence
electron, of an isolated neutral gaseous atom or molecule. It is quantitatively
expressed as
            X + energy â X+ + eâ
where X is any atom or molecule capable of ionization, X+ is that atom or
molecule with an electron removed, and eâ is the removed electron. This is
generally an endothermic_process. Generally, the closer the outermost electrons
are to the nucleus_of_the_atom , the higher the atom's or element's ionization
energy.
The sciences of physics and chemistry use different measures of ionization
energy. In physics, the unit is the amount of energy required to remove a
single electron from a single atom or molecule, expressed as electronvolts. In
chemistry, the unit is the amount of energy required for all of the atoms in a
mole of substance to lose one electron each: molar ionization energy or
enthalpy, expressed as kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) or kilocalories per mole
(kcal/mol).[1]
Comparison of Ei of elements in the periodic_table reveals two periodic_trends:
   1. Ei generally increases as one moves from left to right within a given
      period (that is, row).
   2. Ei generally decreases as one moves from top to bottom in a given group
      (that is, column).
The latter trend results from the outer electron_shell being progressively
farther from the nucleus, with the addition of one inner shell per row as one
moves down the column.
The nth ionization energy refers to the amount of energy required to remove an
electron from the species with a charge of (n-1). For example, the first three
ionization energies are defined as follows:
            1st ionization energy
                  X â X+ + eâ
            2nd ionization energy
                  X+ â X2+ + eâ
            3rd ionization energy
                  X2+ â X3+ + eâ
The term ionization potential is an older name for ionization energy,[2]
because the oldest method of measuring ionization energy was based on ionizing
a sample and accelerating the electron removed using an electrostatic
potential. However this term is now considered obsolete.[3] Some factors
affecting the ionization energy include:
   1. Nuclear charge: the greater the magnitude of nuclear_charge the more
      tightly the electrons are held by the nucleus and hence more will be
      ionization energy.
   2. Number of electron shells: the greater the size of the atom, the less
      tightly the electrons are held by the nucleus and ionization energy will
      be less.
   3. Effective_nuclear_charge (Zeff): the greater the magnitude of electron
      shielding and penetration the less tightly the electrons are held by the
      nucleus, the lower the Zeff of the electron, and hence less will be the
      ionization energy.[4]
   4. Type of orbital ionized: the atom having a more stable electronic
      configuration has less tendency to lose electrons and consequently has
      high ionization energy.
   5. Occupancy of the orbital matters: if the orbital is half or completely
      filled then it is harder to remove electrons

Generally, the (n+1)th ionization energy is larger than the nth ionization
energy. When the next ionization energy involves removing an electron from the
same electron_shell, the increase in ionization energy is primarily due to the
increased net charge of the ion from which the electron is being removed.
Electrons removed from more highly charged ions of a particular element
experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal
requires more energy. In addition, when the next ionization energy involves
removing an electron from a lower electron shell, the greatly decreased
distance between the nucleus and the electron also increases both the
electrostatic force and the distance over which that force must be overcome to
remove the electron. Both of these factors further increase the ionization
energy.
Some values for elements of the third period are given in the following table:
   Successive ionization energy values / kJmolâ1
               (96.485 kJ/mol â¡ 1 eV)

   Na     496  4,560
   Mg     738  1,450 7,730

   Si     786  1,577 3,228  4,354 16,100
    P   1,060  1,890 2,905  4,950  6,270 21,200

   Ar   1,520  2,665 3,945  5,770  7,230  8,780  12,000
Large jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when passing
noble_gas configurations. For example, as can be seen in the table above, the
first two molar ionization energies of magnesium (stripping the two 3s
electrons from a magnesium atom) are much smaller than the third, which
requires stripping off a 2p electron from the neon configuration of Mg2+. That
electron is much closer to the nucleus than the previous 3s electron.
Ionization energy is also a periodic trend within the periodic table
organization. Moving left to right within a period, or upward within a group,
the first ionization energy generally increases, with some exceptions such as
aluminum and sulfur in the table above. As the nuclear charge of the nucleus
increases across the period, the atomic_radius decreases and the electron cloud
becomes closer towards the nucleus.
***** Electrostatic explanation[edit] *****
Atomic ionization energy can be predicted by an analysis using electrostatic
potential and the Bohr_model of the atom, as follows (note that the derivation
uses Gaussian_units).
Consider an electron of charge -e and an atomic nucleus with charge +Ze, where
Z is the number of protons in the nucleus. According to the Bohr model, if the
electron were to approach and bond with the atom, it would come to rest at a
certain radius a. The electrostatic potential V at distance a from the ionic
nucleus, referenced to a point infinitely far away, is:
   V =    Z e  a       {\displaystyle V={\frac {Ze}{a}}\,\!}  [V={\frac {Ze}
{a}}\,\!]
Since the electron is negatively charged, it is drawn inwards by this positive
electrostatic potential. The energy required for the electron to "climb out"
and leave the atom is:
   E = e V =    Z  e  2    a       {\displaystyle E=eV={\frac {Ze^{2}}{a}}\,\!}
[E=eV={\frac {Ze^{2}}{a}}\,\!]
This analysis is incomplete, as it leaves the distance a as an unknown
variable. It can be made more rigorous by assigning to each electron of every
chemical_element a characteristic distance, chosen so that this relation agrees
with experimental data.
It is possible to expand this model considerably by taking a semi-classical
approach, in which momentum is quantized. This approach works very well for the
hydrogen atom, which only has one electron. The magnitude of the angular
momentum for a circular orbit is:
   L =  |   r  &#x00D7;  p   |  = r m v = n &#x210F;   {\displaystyle L=|
{\boldsymbol {r}}\times {\boldsymbol {p}}|=rmv=n\hbar }  [{\displaystyle L=|
{\boldsymbol {r}}\times {\boldsymbol {p}}|=rmv=n\hbar }]
The total energy of the atom is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies,
that is:
   E = T + U =    p  2    2  m   e       &#x2212;    Z  e  2    r   =     m   e
v  2    2   &#x2212;    Z  e  2    r     {\displaystyle E=T+U={\frac {p^{2}}
{2m_{\rm {e}}}}-{\frac {Ze^{2}}{r}}={\frac {m_{\rm {e}}v^{2}}{2}}-{\frac {Ze^
{2}}{r}}}  [{\displaystyle E=T+U={\frac {p^{2}}{2m_{\rm {e}}}}-{\frac {Ze^{2}}
{r}}={\frac {m_{\rm {e}}v^{2}}{2}}-{\frac {Ze^{2}}{r}}}]
Velocity can be eliminated from the kinetic energy term by setting the Coulomb
attraction equal to the centripetal force, giving:
   T =    Z  e  2     2 r      {\displaystyle T={\frac {Ze^{2}}{2r}}}  [T=
{\frac {Ze^{2}}{2r}}]
Solving the angular momentum for v and substituting this into the expression
for kinetic energy, we have:
       n  2    &#x210F;  2     r  m   e       = Z  e  2     {\displaystyle
{\frac {n^{2}\hbar ^{2}}{rm_{\rm {e}}}}=Ze^{2}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {n^
{2}\hbar ^{2}}{rm_{\rm {e}}}}=Ze^{2}}]
This establishes the dependence of the radius on n. That is:
   r ( n ) =     n  2    &#x210F;  2     Z  m   e     e  2
{\displaystyle r(n)={\frac {n^{2}\hbar ^{2}}{Zm_{\rm {e}}e^{2}}}}  [
{\displaystyle r(n)={\frac {n^{2}\hbar ^{2}}{Zm_{\rm {e}}e^{2}}}}]
Now the energy can be found in terms of Z, e, and r. Using the new value for
the kinetic energy in the total energy equation above, it is found that:
   E = &#x2212;    Z  e  2     2 r      {\displaystyle E=-{\frac {Ze^{2}}{2r}}}
[E=-{\frac {Ze^{2}}{2r}}]
At its smallest value, n is equal to 1 and r is the Bohr_radius a0 which equals
&#x210F;  2    m  e  2        {\displaystyle {\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{me^{2}}}}  [
{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{me^{2}}}]. Now, the equation for the energy can be
established in terms of the Bohr radius. Doing so gives the result:
   E = &#x2212;   1  n  2         Z  2    e  2     2  a  0      = &#x2212;
Z  2   13.6 e V   n  2       {\displaystyle E=-{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}{\frac {Z^
{2}e^{2}}{2a_{0}}}=-{\frac {Z^{2}13.6eV}{n^{2}}}}  [E=-{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}{\frac
{Z^{2}e^{2}}{2a_{0}}}=-{\frac {Z^{2}13.6eV}{n^{2}}}]
***** Quantum-mechanical explanation[edit] *****
According to the more complete theory of quantum_mechanics, the location of an
electron is best described as a probability distribution within an electron
cloud, i.e. atomic_orbital. The energy can be calculated by integrating over
this cloud. The cloud's underlying mathematical representation is the
wavefunction which is built from Slater_determinants consisting of molecular
spin orbitals. These are related by Pauli's_exclusion_principle to the
antisymmetrized products of the atomic or molecular_orbitals.
In general, calculating the nth ionization energy requires calculating the
energies of     Z &#x2212; n + 1   {\displaystyle Z-n+1}  [Z-n+1] and     Z
&#x2212; n   {\displaystyle Z-n}  [Z-n] electron systems. Calculating these
energies exactly is not possible except for the simplest systems (i.e.
hydrogen), primarily because of difficulties in integrating the electron
correlation terms. Therefore, approximation methods are routinely employed,
with different methods varying in complexity (computational time) and in
accuracy compared to empirical data. This has become a well-studied problem and
is routinely done in computational_chemistry. At the lowest level of
approximation, the ionization energy is provided by Koopmans'_theorem.
***** Vertical and adiabatic ionization energy in molecules[edit] *****
Figure 1. FranckâCondon principle energy diagram. For ionization of a
diatomic molecule the only nuclear coordinate is the bond length. The lower
curve is the potential_energy_curve of the neutral molecule, and the upper
curve is for the positive ion with a longer bond length. The blue arrow is
vertical ionization, here from the ground state of the molecule to the v=2
level of the ion.
Ionization of molecules often leads to changes in molecular_geometry, and two
types of (first) ionization energy are defined â adiabatic and vertical.[5]
**** Adiabatic ionization energy[edit] ****
The adiabatic ionization energy of a molecule is the minimum amount of energy
required to remove an electron from a neutral molecule, i.e. the difference
between the energy of the vibrational ground_state of the neutral species (v" =
0 level) and that of the positive ion (v' = 0). The specific equilibrium
geometry of each species does not affect this value.
**** Vertical ionization energy[edit] ****
Due to the possible changes in molecular geometry that may result from
ionization, additional transitions may exist between the vibrational ground
state of the neutral species and vibrational excited_states of the positive
ion. In other words, ionization is accompanied by vibrational_excitation. The
intensity of such transitions are explained by the FranckâCondon_principle,
which predicts that the most probable and intense transition corresponds to the
vibrational excited state of the positive ion that has the same geometry as the
neutral molecule. This transition is referred to as the "vertical" ionization
energy since it is represented by a completely vertical line on a potential
energy diagram (see Figure).
For a diatomic molecule, the geometry is defined by the length of a single
bond. The removal of an electron from a bonding molecular_orbital weakens the
bond and increases the bond length. In Figure 1, the lower potential_energy
curve is for the neutral molecule and the upper surface is for the positive
ion. Both curves plot the potential energy as a function of bond length. The
horizontal lines correspond to vibrational_levels with their associated
vibrational_wave_functions. Since the ion has a weaker bond, it will have a
longer bond length. This effect is represented by shifting the minimum of the
potential energy curve to the right of the neutral species. The adiabatic
ionization is the diagonal transition to the vibrational ground state of the
ion. Vertical ionization may involve vibrational excitation of the ionic state
and therefore requires greater energy.
In many circumstances, the adiabatic ionization energy is often a more
interesting physical quantity since it describes the difference in energy
between the two potential energy surfaces. However, due to experimental
limitations, the adiabatic ionization energy is often difficult to determine,
whereas the vertical detachment energy is easily identifiable and measurable.
***** Analogs of ionization energy to other systems[edit] *****
While the term ionization energy is largely used only for gas-phase atomic or
molecular species, there are a number of analogous quantities that consider the
amount of energy required to remove an electron from other physical systems.
**** Electron binding energy[edit] ****
Electron binding_energy is a generic term for the ionization energy that can be
used for species with any charge state. For example, the electron binding
energy for the chloride ion is the minimum amount of energy required to remove
an electron from the chlorine atom when it has a charge of -1. In this
particular example, the electron binding energy has the same magnitude as the
electron affinity for the neutral chlorine atom. In another example, the
electron binding energy refers the minimum amount of energy required to remove
an electron from the dicarboxylate dianion âO2C(CH2)8COâ
2.The highest specific binding energy is 8.8 MeV, and occurs for nickel. Nickel
has 28 protons, a magic number
**** Work function[edit] ****
Work_function is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron
from a solid surface.
