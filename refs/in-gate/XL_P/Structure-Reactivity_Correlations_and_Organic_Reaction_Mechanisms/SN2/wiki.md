Structure of the SN2 transition state
The SN2 reaction is a type of reaction_mechanism that is common in organic
chemistry. In this mechanism, one bond is broken and one bond is formed
synchronously, i.e., in one step. SN2 is a kind of nucleophilic_substitution
reaction mechanism. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow (rate-
determining) step, this leads to the term substitution nucleophilic (bi-
molecular) or SN2, the other major kind is SN1.[1] Many other more specialized
mechanisms describe substitution reactions.
The reaction type is so common that it has other names, e.g. "bimolecular
nucleophilic substitution", or, among inorganic chemists, "associative
substitution" or "interchange mechanism".

***** Reaction mechanism[edit] *****
The reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp3 carbon center with an
electronegative, stable leaving group attached to it (often denoted X), which
is frequently a halide atom. The breaking of the CâX bond and the formation
of the new bond (often denoted CâY or CâNu) occur simultaneously through a
transition_state in which a carbon under nucleophilic attack is
pentacoordinate, and approximately sp2 hybridised. The nucleophile attacks the
carbon at 180Â° to the leaving_group, since this provides the best overlap
between the nucleophile's lone pair and the CâX Ï* antibonding orbital. The
leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed
with inversion of the tetrahedral geometry at the central atom.
If the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral, then this often leads to
inversion of configuration (stereochemistry), called a Walden_inversion.
In an example of the SN2 reaction, the attack of Brâ (the nucleophile) on an
ethyl_chloride (the electrophile) results in ethyl_bromide, with chloride
ejected as the leaving group.:
SN2 reaction of chloroethane with bromide ion
SN2 attack occurs if the backside route of attack is not sterically_hindered by
substituents on the substrate. Therefore, this mechanism usually occurs at
unhindered primary_and_secondary_carbon centres. If there is steric crowding on
the substrate near the leaving group, such as at a tertiary carbon centre, the
substitution will involve an SN1 rather than an SN2 mechanism, (an SN1 would
also be more likely in this case because a sufficiently stable carbocation
intermediary could be formed).
***** Factors affecting the rate of the reaction[edit] *****
Four factors affect the rate of the reaction:[2][3]
**** Substrate[edit] ****
The substrate plays the most important part in determining the rate of the
reaction. This is because the nucleophile attacks from the back of the
substrate, thus breaking the carbon-leaving group bond and forming the carbon-
nucleophile bond. Therefore, to maximise the rate of the SN2 reaction, the back
of the substrate must be as unhindered as possible. Overall, this means that
methyl and primary substrates react the fastest, followed by secondary
substrates. Tertiary substrates do not participate in SN2 reactions, because of
steric_hindrance. Structures that can form highly stable cations by simple loss
of the leaving group, for example, as a resonance-stabilized carbocation, are
especially likely to react via an SN1 pathway in competition with SN2.
**** Nucleophile[edit] ****
Like the substrate, steric_hindrance affects the nucleophile's strength. The
methoxide anion, for example, is both a strong base and nucleophile because it
is a methyl nucleophile, and is thus very much unhindered. tert-Butoxide, on
the other hand, is a strong base, but a poor nucleophile, because of its three
methyl groups hindering its approach to the carbon. Nucleophile strength is
also affected by charge and electronegativity: nucleophilicity increases with
increasing negative charge and decreasing electronegativity. For example, OHâ
is a better nucleophile than water, and Iâ is a better nucleophile than Brâ
(in polar protic solvents). In a polar aprotic solvent, nucleophilicity
increases up a column of the periodic table as there is no hydrogen bonding
between the solvent and nucleophile; in this case nucleophilicity mirrors
basicity. Iâ would therefore be a weaker nucleophile than Brâ because it is
a weaker base. Verdict - A strong/anionic nucleophile always favours SN2 manner
of nucleophillic substitution.
**** Solvent[edit] ****
The solvent affects the rate of reaction because solvents may or may not
surround a nucleophile, thus hindering or not hindering its approach to the
carbon atom.[4] Polar aprotic solvents, like tetrahydrofuran, are better
solvents for this reaction than polar protic_solvents because polar protic
solvents will hydrogen_bond to the nucleophile, hindering it from attacking the
carbon with the leaving group. A polar aprotic solvent with low dielectric
constant or a hindered dipole end will favour SN2 manner of nucleophilic
substitution reaction. Examples: DMSO, DMF, acetone etc. In polar aprotic
solvent, nucleophilicity parallels basicity.
**** Leaving group[edit] ****
The stability of the leaving group as an anion and the strength of its bond to
the carbon atom both affect the rate of reaction. The more stable the conjugate
base of the leaving group is, the more likely that it will take the two
electrons of its bond to carbon during the reaction. Therefore, the weaker the
leaving group is as a conjugate base, and thus the stronger its corresponding
acid, the better the leaving group. Examples of good leaving groups are
therefore the halides (except fluoride, due to its strong bond to the carbon
atom) and tosylate, whereas HOâ and H2Nâ are not.
***** Reaction kinetics[edit] *****
The rate of an SN2 reaction is second_order, as the rate-determining_step
depends on the nucleophile concentration, [Nuâ] as well as the concentration
of substrate, [RX].
      r = k[RX][Nuâ]
This is a key difference between the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. In the SN1
reaction the nucleophile attacks after the rate-limiting step is over, whereas
in SN2 the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step. In
other words, the rate of SN1 reactions depend only on the concentration of the
substrate while the SN2 reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the
substrate and nucleophile.
It has been shown[5] that except in uncommon (but predictable cases) primary
and secondary substrates go exclusively by the SN2 mechanism while tertiary
substrates go via the SN1 reaction. There are two factors which complicate
determining the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions at secondary
carbons:
1) Many reactions studied are solvolysis reactions where a solvent
moleculeâoften an alcohol, is the nucleophile. While still a second order
reaction mechanistically, the reaction is kinetically first order as the
concentration of the nucleophileâthe solvent molecule, is effectively
constant during the reaction. This type of reaction is often called a pseudo
first order reaction.
2) In reactions where the leaving group is also a good nucleophileâbromide
for instance, the leaving group can perform an SN2 reaction on a substrate
molecule. If the substrate is chiral, this inverts the configuration of the
substrate before solvolysis, leading to a racemized productâthe product that
would be expected from an SN1 mechanism. In the case of a bromide leaving group
in alcoholic solvent Cowdrey et al.[6] have shown that bromide can have an SN2
rate constant 100-250 times higher than the rate constant for ethanol. Thus,
after only a few percent solvolysis of an enantiospecific substrate, it becomes
racemic.
The examples in textbooks of secondary substrates going by the SN1 mechanism
invariably involve the use of bromide (or other good nucleophile) as the
leaving group have confused the understanding of alkyl nucleophilic
substitution reactions at secondary carbons for 80 years[3]. Work with the 2-
adamantyl system (SN2 not possible) by Schleyer and co-workers,[7] the use of
azide (an excellent nucleophile but very poor leaving group) by Weiner and
Sneen,[8][9] the development of sulfonate leaving groups (non-nucleophilic good
leaving groups), and the demonstration of significant experimental problems in
the initial claim of an SN1 mechanism in the solvolysis of optically active 2-
bromooctane by Hughes et al.[10][3] have demonstrated conclusively that
secondary substrates go exclusively (except in unusual but predictable cases)
by the SN2 mechanism.
***** E2 competition[edit] *****
A common side_reaction taking place with SN2 reactions is E2_elimination: the
incoming anion can act as a base rather than as a nucleophile, abstracting a
proton and leading to formation of the alkene. This pathway is favored with
sterically hindered nucleophiles. Elimination reactions are usually favoured at
elevated temperatures[11] because of increased entropy. This effect can be
demonstrated in the gas-phase reaction between a sulfonate and a simple alkyl
bromide taking place inside a mass_spectrometer:[12][13]
      [Competition_experiment_between_SN2_and_E2]
With ethyl_bromide, the reaction product is predominantly the substitution
product. As steric_hindrance around the electrophilic center increases, as with
isobutyl bromide, substitution is disfavored and elimination is the predominant
reaction. Other factors favoring elimination are the strength of the base. With
the less basic benzoate substrate, isopropyl bromide reacts with 55%
substitution. In general, gas phase reactions and solution phase reactions of
this type follow the same trends, even though in the first, solvent_effects are
eliminated.
***** Roundabout mechanism[edit] *****
A development attracting attention in 2008 concerns a SN2 roundabout mechanism
observed in a gas-phase reaction between chloride ions and methyl_iodide with a
special technique called crossed molecular beam imaging. When the chloride ions
have sufficient velocity, the energy of the resulting iodide ions after the
collision is much lower than expected, and it is theorized that energy is lost
as a result of a full roundabout of the methyl group around the iodine atom
before the actual displacement takes place.[14][15][16]
