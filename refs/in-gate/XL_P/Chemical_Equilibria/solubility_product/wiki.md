Solubility equilibrium is a type of dynamic_equilibrium that exists when a
chemical_compound in the solid state is in chemical_equilibrium with a solution
of that compound. The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with
chemical reaction with another constituent of the solvent, such as acid or
alkali. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent
equilibrium_constant. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical,
environmental and many other scenarios.

***** Definitions[edit] *****
A solubility equilibrium exists when a chemical_compound in the solid state is
in chemical_equilibrium with a solution of that compound. The equilibrium is an
example of dynamic_equilibrium in that some individual molecules migrate
between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of dissolution and
precipitation are equal to one another. When equilibrium is established, the
solution is said to be saturated. The concentration of the solute in a
saturated solution is known as the solubility. Units of solubility may be molar
(mol dmâ3) or expressed as mass per unit volume, such as Î¼g mlâ1.
Solubility is temperature dependent. A solution containing a higher
concentration of solute than the solubility is said to be supersaturated. A
supersaturated solution may be induced to come to equilibrium by the addition
of a "seed" which may be a tiny crystal of the solute, or a tiny solid
particle, which initiates precipitation.
There are three main types of solubility equilibria.
   1. Simple dissolution.
   2. Dissolution with dissociation reaction. This is characteristic of salts.
      The equilibrium constant is known in this case as a solubility product.
   3. Dissolution with ionization reaction. This is characteristic of the
      dissolution of weak_acids or weak_bases in aqueous media of varying pH.
In each case an equilibrium_constant can be specified as a quotient of
activities. This equilibrium constant is dimensionless as activity is a
dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the
equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity
coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See equilibrium
chemistry#Equilibrium_constant for details. Moreover, the concentration of
solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the
equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility
equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are
measured. Solubility constants defined in terms of concentrations are not only
temperature dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the
solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.
**** Phase effect[edit] ****
Equilibria are defined for specific crystal phases. Therefore, the solubility
product is expected to be different depending on the phase of the solid. For
example, aragonite and calcite will have different solubility products even
though they have both the same chemical identity (calcium_carbonate). Under any
given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the
other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is
established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable
precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a metastable state.
In pharmacology, the metastable state is sometimes referred to as amorphous
state. Amorphous drugs have higher solubility than their crystalline
counterparts due to the absence of long-distance interactions inherent in
crystal lattice. Thus, it takes less energy to solvate the molecules in
amorphous phase. The_effect of amorphous phase on solubility is widely used to
make drugs more soluble. [1][2]
**** Particle size effect[edit] ****
The thermodynamic solubility constant is defined for large monocrystals.
Solubility will increase with decreasing size of solute particle (or droplet)
because of the additional surface energy. This effect is generally small unless
particles become very small, typically smaller than 1 Î¼m. The effect of the
particle size on solubility constant can be quantified as follows:
         log &#x2061;  (  &#x2217;    K  A   ) = log &#x2061;  (  &#x2217;    K
      A &#x2192; 0   ) +    &#x03B3;  A   m      3.454 R T      {\displaystyle
      \log(^{*}K_{A})=\log(^{*}K_{A\to 0})+{\frac {\gamma A_{\mathrm {m} }}
      {3.454RT}}}  [{\displaystyle \log(^{*}K_{A})=\log(^{*}K_{A\to 0})+{\frac
      {\gamma A_{\mathrm {m} }}{3.454RT}}}]
where *KA is the solubility constant for the solute particles with the molar
surface area A, *KAâ0 is the solubility constant for substance with molar
surface area tending to zero (i.e., when the particles are large), Î³ is the
surface_tension of the solute particle in the solvent, Am is the molar surface
area of the solute (in m2/mol), Ris the universal_gas_constant, and T is the
absolute_temperature.[3]
**** Salt effects[edit] ****
The salt effects[4] (salting_in and salting-out) refers to the fact that the
presence of a salt which has no_ion_in_common with the solute, has an effect on
the ionic_strength of the solution and hence on activity_coefficients, so that
the equilibrium constant, expressed as a concentration quotient, changes.
**** Temperature effect[edit] ****
[SolubilityVsTemperature.png]
Solubility is sensitive to changes in temperature. For example, sugar is more
soluble in hot water than cool water. It occurs because solubility constants,
like other types of equilibrium constants, are functions of temperature. In
accordance with Le_Chatelier's_Principle, when the dissolution process is
endothermic (heat is absorbed), solubility increases with rising temperature.
This effect is the basis for the process of recrystallization, which can be
used to purify a chemical compound. When dissolution is exothermic (heat is
released) solubility decreases with rising temperature.[5] Sodium_sulfate shows
increasing solubility with temperature below about 32.4 Â°C, but a decreasing
solubility at higher temperature.[6] This is because the solid phase is the
decahydrate (Na
2SO
4Â·10H
2O) below the transition temperature, but a different hydrate above that
temperature.
The dependence on temperature of solubility for an ideal solution (achieved for
low solubility substances) is given by the following expression containing the
enthalpy of melting ÎmH and mole fraction of the solute at saturation:
     (    &#x2202; ln &#x2061;  x  i     &#x2202; T    )   P   =        H
&#x00AF;     i ,  a q    &#x2212;  H  i ,  c r      R  T  2
{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \ln x_{i}}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}={\frac
{{\bar {H}}_{i,\mathrm {aq} }-H_{i,\mathrm {cr} }}{RT^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle
\left({\frac {\partial \ln x_{i}}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}={\frac {{\bar {H}}_
{i,\mathrm {aq} }-H_{i,\mathrm {cr} }}{RT^{2}}}}]
where         H &#x00AF;     i ,  a q      {\displaystyle {\bar {H}}_{i,\mathrm
{aq} }}  [{\displaystyle {\bar {H}}_{i,\mathrm {aq} }}] is the partial_molar
enthalpy of the solute at infinite dilution and      H  i ,  c r
{\displaystyle H_{i,\mathrm {cr} }}  [{\displaystyle H_{i,\mathrm {cr} }}] the
enthalpy per mole of the pure crystal[7].
This differential expression for a non-electrolyte can be integrated on a
temperature interval to give[8]:
         l n  x  i   =     &#x0394;  m    H  i    R    (  1  /   T  f
      &#x2212; 1  /  T  )    {\displaystyle lnx_{i}={\frac {\Delta _{m}H_{i}}
      {R}}\left(1/T_{f}-1/T\right)}  [{\displaystyle lnx_{i}={\frac {\Delta _
      {m}H_{i}}{R}}\left(1/T_{f}-1/T\right)}]
For nonideal solutions activity of the solute at saturation appears instead of
mole fraction solubility in the derivative w.r.t. temperature:
     (    &#x2202; ln &#x2061;  a  i     &#x2202; T    )   P   =     H  i ,  a
q    &#x2212;  H  i ,  c r      R  T  2        {\displaystyle \left({\frac
{\partial \ln a_{i}}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}={\frac {H_{i,\mathrm {aq} }-H_
{i,\mathrm {cr} }}{RT^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \ln a_{i}}
{\partial T}}\right)_{P}={\frac {H_{i,\mathrm {aq} }-H_{i,\mathrm {cr} }}{RT^
{2}}}}]
**** Pressure effect[edit] ****
For condensed phases (solids and liquids), the pressure dependence of
solubility is typically weak and usually neglected in practice. Assuming an
ideal_solution, the dependence can be quantified as:
           (    &#x2202; ln &#x2061;  x  i     &#x2202; P    )   T   = &#x2212;
      V &#x00AF;     i ,  a q    &#x2212;  V  i ,  c r      R T
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \ln x_{i}}{\partial P}}\right)_
      {T}=-{\frac {{\bar {V}}_{i,\mathrm {aq} }-V_{i,\mathrm {cr} }}{RT}}}  [
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \ln x_{i}}{\partial P}}\right)_
      {T}=-{\frac {{\bar {V}}_{i,\mathrm {aq} }-V_{i,\mathrm {cr} }}{RT}}}]
where the index i iterates the components, xi is the mole fraction of the ith
component in the solution, P is the pressure, the index T refers to constant
temperature, -Vi,aq is the partial_molar_volume of the ith component in the
solution, Vi,cr is the partial molar volume of the ith component in the
dissolving solid, and R is the universal_gas_constant.[9]
The pressure dependence of solubility does occasionally have practical
significance. For example, precipitation_fouling of oil fields and wells by
calcium_sulfate (which decreases its solubility with decreasing pressure) can
result in decreased productivity with time.
***** Simple dissolution[edit] *****
Dissolution of an organic solid can be described as an equilibrium between the
substance in its solid and dissolved forms. For example, when sucrose (table
sugar) forms a saturated solution
      C12H22O11(s) â C12H22O11(aq).
An equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written, as for any chemical
reaction (products over reactants):
          K  &#x2296;   =    {    C   12     H   22     O   11   ( a q )  }
      {    C   12     H   22     O   11   ( s )  }      {\displaystyle K^
      {\ominus }={\frac {\left\{\mathrm {{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}
      \right\}}{\left\{\mathrm {{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(s)} \right\}}}}  [
      {\displaystyle K^{\ominus }={\frac {\left\{\mathrm {{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_
      {11}(aq)} \right\}}{\left\{\mathrm {{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(s)}
      \right\}}}}]
where Ko is called the thermodynamic solubility constant. The braces indicate
activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, unity. Therefore
          K  &#x2296;   =  {    C   12     H   22     O   11   ( a q )  }
      {\displaystyle K^{\ominus }=\left\{\mathrm {{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)}
      \right\}}  [{\displaystyle K^{\ominus }=\left\{\mathrm {{C}_{12}{H}_{22}
      {O}_{11}(aq)} \right\}}]
The activity of a substance, A, in solution can be expressed as the product of
the concentration, [A], and an activity_coefficient, Î³. When Ko is divided by
Î³, the solubility constant, Ks,
          K   s    =  [    C   12     H   22     O   11   ( a q )  ]
      {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {s} }=\left[\mathrm {{C}_{12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}
      (aq)} \right]\,}  [{\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {s} }=\left[\mathrm {{C}_
      {12}{H}_{22}{O}_{11}(aq)} \right]\,}]
is obtained. This is equivalent to defining the standard_state as the saturated
solution so that the activity coefficient is equal to one. The solubility
constant is a true constant only if the activity coefficient is not affected by
the presence of any other solutes that may be present. The unit of the
solubility constant is the same as the unit of the concentration of the solute.
For sucrose K = 1.971 mol dmâ3 at 25 Â°C. This shows that the solubility of
sucrose at 25 Â°C is nearly 2 mol dmâ3 (540 g/l). Sucrose is unusual in that
it does not easily form a supersaturated solution at higher concentrations, as
do most other carbohydrates.
***** Dissolution with dissociation[edit] *****
Ionic compounds normally dissociate into their constituent ions when they
dissolve in water. For example, for silver_chloride:
      AgCl(s) â Ag+(aq) + Clâ(aq)
The expression for the equilibrium constant for this reaction is:
          K  &#x2296;   =     {    Ag  +       ( aq )     }   {    Cl  &#x2212;
      ( aq )     }    {   AgCl   ( s )        }    =  {    Ag  +       ( aq )
      }   {    Cl  &#x2212;       ( aq )     }    {\displaystyle K^{\ominus }=
      {\frac {\left\{{\ce {Ag+}}_{{\ce {(aq)}}}\right\}\left\{{\ce {Cl-}}_{{\ce
      {(aq)}}}\right\}}{\left\{{\ce {AgCl_{(s)}}}\right\}}}=\left\{{\ce {Ag+}}_
      {{\ce {(aq)}}}\right\}\left\{{\ce {Cl-}}_{{\ce {(aq)}}}\right\}}  [
      {\displaystyle K^{\ominus }={\frac {\left\{{\ce {Ag+}}_{{\ce {
      (aq)}}}\right\}\left\{{\ce {Cl-}}_{{\ce {(aq)}}}\right\}}{\left\{{\ce
      {AgCl_{(s)}}}\right\}}}=\left\{{\ce {Ag+}}_{{\ce {(aq)}}}\right\}\left\{
      {\ce {Cl-}}_{{\ce {(aq)}}}\right\}}]
where      K  &#x2296;     {\displaystyle K^{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle K^
{\ominus }}] is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and braces indicate
activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, equal to one.
When the solubility of the salt is very low the activity coefficients of the
ions in solution are nearly equal to one. By setting them to be actually equal
to one this expression reduces to the solubility product expression:
          K   sp    = [   Ag  +    ] [   Cl  &#x2212;    ] = [   Ag  +     ]  2
      = [   Cl  &#x2212;     ]  2   .    {\displaystyle K_{{\ce {sp}}}=[{\ce
      {Ag+}}][{\ce {Cl-}}]=[{\ce {Ag+}}]^{2}=[{\ce {Cl-}}]^{2}.\,}  [
      {\displaystyle K_{{\ce {sp}}}=[{\ce {Ag+}}][{\ce {Cl-}}]=[{\ce {Ag+}}]^
      {2}=[{\ce {Cl-}}]^{2}.\,}]
For 2:2 and 3:3 salts, such as CaSO4 and FePO4, the general expression for the
solubility product is the same as for a 1:1 electrolyte
      AB â Ap+ + Bpâ
      Ksp = [A][B] = [A]2 = [B]2 (electrical charges are omitted in general
      expressions, for simplicity of notation)
The equilibrium expression for an unsymmetrical salt like CaCl2 or Na2(SO4) is
given by
      ApBq â p Aq+ + q Bpâ
A solute like Sn(SO4)2 is a 1:2 electrolyte like CaCl2, so a more complicated
expression is needed for the solution equilibrium as the ionic charges are Sn4+
and SO42-. The solubility product, however, depends only on stoichiometry and
is given by
      Ksp = [A]p[B]q
When the product dissociates the concentration of B is equal to q/p times the
concentration of A.
      [B] = q/p[A]
Therefore
          K   sp    = [  A   ]  p     (   q p   )   q   [  A   ]  q   =   (   q
      p   )   q   [  A   ]  p + q     {\displaystyle K_{{\ce {sp}}}=[{\ce
      {A}}]^{p}\left({\frac {q}{p}}\right)^{q}[{\ce {A}}]^{q}=\left({\frac {q}
      {p}}\right)^{q}[{\ce {A}}]^{p+q}}  [{\displaystyle K_{{\ce {sp}}}=[{\ce
      {A}}]^{p}\left({\frac {q}{p}}\right)^{q}[{\ce {A}}]^{q}=\left({\frac {q}
      {p}}\right)^{q}[{\ce {A}}]^{p+q}}]
         [  A  ] =     K   sp       (   q p   )   q      p + q
      {\displaystyle [{\ce {A}}]={\sqrt[{p+q}]{K_{{\ce {sp}}} \over {\left(
      {\frac {q}{p}}\right)^{q}}}}}  [{\displaystyle [{\ce {A}}]={\sqrt[{p+q}]
      {K_{{\ce {sp}}} \over {\left({\frac {q}{p}}\right)^{q}}}}}]
The solubility, S is 1/p[A]. One may incorporate 1/p and insert it under the
root to obtain
         S =    [  A  ]  p   =    [  B  ]  q   =     K   sp        (   q p   )
      q     p  p + q      p + q    =     K   sp       q  q     p  p      p + q

      {\sqrt[{p+q}]{K_{{\ce {sp}}} \over {q^{q}}p^{p}}}}  [{\displaystyle S={[
      {\ce {A}}] \over p}={[{\ce {B}}] \over q}={\sqrt[{p+q}]{K_{{\ce {sp}}}

                    {\ce {sp}}} \over 108}}}]
Solubility products are often expressed in logarithmic form. Thus, for calcium
sulfate, Ksp = 4.93Ã10â5, log Ksp = â4.32. The smaller the value, or the
more negative the log value, the lower the solubility.
Some salts are not fully dissociated in solution. Examples include MgSO4,
famously discovered by Manfred_Eigen to be present in seawater as both an inner
sphere_complex and an outer_sphere_complex.[10] The solubility of such salts is
calculated by the method outlined in dissolution_with_reaction.
**** Hydroxides[edit] ****
For hydroxides solubility products are often given in a modified form, K*sp,
using hydrogen ion concentration in place of hydroxide ion concentration.[11]
The two concentrations are related by the self-ionization constant for water,
Kw.
      Kw = [H+][OHâ]
For example,
      Ca(OH)2 â Ca2+ + 2 OHâ
      Ksp = [Ca2+][OHâ]2 = [Ca2+]Kw2[H+]â2
      K*sp = Ksp/K2
      w = [Ca2+][H+]â2
log Ksp for Ca(OH)2 is about â5 at ambient temperatures; log K*sp = â5 + 2
Ã 14 = 23, approximately.
**** Common-ion effect[edit] ****
The common-ion_effect is the effect of decreasing the solubility of one salt,
when another salt, which has an ion in common with it, is also present. For
example, the solubility of silver_chloride, AgCl, is lowered when sodium
chloride, a source of the common ion chloride, is added to a suspension of AgCl
in water.[12]
      AgCl(s) â Ag+(aq) + Clâ(aq);      Ksp = [Ag+][Clâ]
The solubility, S, in the absence of a common ion can be calculated as follows.
The concentrations [Ag+] and [Clâ] are equal because one mole of AgCl
dissociates into one mole of Ag+ and one mole of Clâ. Let the concentration
of [Ag+](aq) be denoted by x.
      Ksp = x2;      S = x = √Ksp
Ksp for AgCl is equal to 1.77Ã10â10 mol2 dmâ6 at 25 Â°C, so the solubility
is 1.33Ã10â5 mol dmâ3.
Now suppose that sodium chloride is also present, at a concentration of
0.01 mol dmâ3. The solubility, ignoring any possible effect of the sodium
ions, is now calculated by
      Ksp = x(0.01 + x)
This is a quadratic equation in x, which is also equal to the solubility.
      x2 + 0.01x â Ksp = 0
In the case of silver chloride x2 is very much smaller than 0.01x, so this term
can be ignored. Therefore
      S = x = Ksp/0.01 = 1.77Ã10â8 mol dmâ3,
a considerable reduction. In gravimetric_analysis for silver, the reduction in
solubility due to the common ion effect is used to ensure "complete"
precipitation of AgCl.
***** Dissolution with reaction[edit] *****
When a concentrated solution of ammonia is added to a suspension of silver
chloride dissolution occurs because a complex of Ag+ is formed
A typical reaction with dissolution involves a weak_base, B, dissolving in an
acidic aqueous solution.
      B(s) + H+ (aq) â BH+ (aq)
This reaction is very important for pharmaceutical products.[13] Dissolution of
weak acids in alkaline media is similarly important.
      HnA(s) + OHâ(aq) â Hnâ1Aâ(aq) + H2O
The uncharged molecule usually has lower solubility than the ionic form, so
solubility depends on pH and the acid_dissociation_constant of the solute. The
term "intrinsic solubility" is used to describe the solubility of the un-
ionized form in the absence of acid or alkali.
Leaching of aluminium salts from rocks and soil by acid_rain is another example
of dissolution with reaction: alumino-silicates are bases which react with the
acid to form soluble species, such as Al3+(aq).
Formation of a chemical complex may also change solubility. A well-known
example, is the addition of a concentrated solution of ammonia to a suspension
of silver_chloride, in which dissolution is favoured by the formation of an
ammine complex.
      AgCl(s) + 2 NH3(aq) â [Ag(NH3)2]+(aq) + Clâ(aq)
Another example involves the addition of water_softeners to washing powders to
inhibit the precipitation of salts of magnesium and calcium ions, which are
present in hard_water, by forming complexes with them.
The calculation of solubility in these cases requires two or more simultaneous
equilibria to be considered. For example,
      Intrinsic solubility    B(s) â B(aq)         Ks = [B(aq)]
      equilibrium
      Acidâbase equilibriB(aq) + H+(aq) â BH+ Ka = [B(aq)][H+(aq)]/
                              (aq)                      [BH+(aq)]
***** Experimental determination[edit] *****
The determination of solubility is fraught with difficulties.[3] First and
foremost is the difficulty in establishing that the system is in equilibrium at
the chosen temperature. This is because both precipitation and dissolution
reactions may be extremely slow. If the process is very slow solvent
evaporation may be an issue. Supersaturation may occur. With very insoluble
substances, the concentrations in solution are very low and difficult to
determine. The methods used fall broadly into two categories, static and
dynamic.
**** Static methods[edit] ****
In static methods a mixture is brought to equilibrium and the concentration of
a species in the solution phase is determined by chemical_analysis. This
usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases. In order to do
this the equilibration and separation should be performed in a thermostatted
room.[14] Very low concentrations can be measured if a radioactive tracer is
incorporated in the solid phase.
A variation of the static method is to add a solution of the substance in a
non-aqueous solvent, such as dimethyl_sulfoxide, to an aqueous buffer mixture.
[15] Immediate precipitation may occur giving a cloudy mixture. The solubility
measured for such a mixture is known as "kinetic solubility". The cloudiness is
due to the fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in
Tyndall_scattering. In fact the particles are so small that the particle_size
effect comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium
solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the
crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process
known as precipitate ageing.[16]
**** Dynamic methods[edit] ****
Solubility values of organic acids, bases, and ampholytes of pharmaceutical
interest may be obtained by a process called "Chasing equilibrium solubility".
[17] In this procedure, a quantity of substance is first dissolved at a pH
where it exists predominantly in its ionized form and then a precipitate of the
neutral (un-ionized) species is formed by changing the pH. Subsequently, the
rate of change of pH due to precipitation or dissolution is monitored and
strong acid and base titrant are added to adjust the pH to discover the
equilibrium conditions when the two rates are equal. The advantage of this
method is that it is relatively fast as the quantity of precipitate formed is
quite small. However, the performance of the method may be affected by the
formation supersaturated solutions.
