****** Common-ion effect ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The common-ion effect states that in a chemical solution in which several
species reversibly associate with each other by an equilibrium process,
increasing the concentration of any one of its dissociated components by adding
another chemical that also contains it will cause an increased amount of
association.[1] This result is a consequence of Le_Chatelier's_principle for
the equilibrium reaction of the association/dissociation. The effect is
commonly seen as an effect on the solubility of salts and other weak
electrolytes. Adding an additional amount of one of the ions of the salt
generally leads to increased precipitation of the salt, which reduces the
concentration of both ions of the salt until the solubility_equilibrium is
reached. The effect is based on the fact that both the original salt and the
other added chemical have one ion in common with each other.

***** Solubility effects[edit] *****
Main article: solubility_equilibrium
A practical example used very widely in areas drawing drinking_water from chalk
or limestone aquifers is the addition of sodium carbonate to the raw water to
reduce the hardness of the water. In the water_treatment process, highly
soluble sodium_carbonate salt is added to precipitate out sparingly soluble
calcium_carbonate. The very pure and finely divided precipitate of calcium
carbonate that is generated is a valuable by-product used in the manufacture of
toothpaste.
The salting-out process used in the manufacture of soaps benefits from the
common-ion effect. Soaps are sodium salts of fatty_acids. Addition of sodium
chloride reduces the solubility of the soap salts. The soaps precipitate due to
a combination of common-ion effect and increased ionic_strength.
Sea, brackish and other waters that contain appreciable amount of sodium ions
(Na+) interfere with the normal behavior of soap because of common-ion effect.
In the presence of excess Na+, the solubility of soap salts is reduced, making
the soap less effective.
***** Buffering effect[edit] *****
Main article: buffer_solution
A buffer solution contains an acid and its conjugate base or a base and its
conjugate acid.[2] Addition of the conjugate ion will result in a change of pH
of the buffer solution. For example, if both sodium_acetate and acetic_acid are
dissolved in the same solution they both dissociate and ionize to produce
acetate_ions. Sodium acetate is a strong_electrolyte, so it dissociates
completely in solution. Acetic acid is a weak_acid, so it only ionizes
slightly. According to Le_Chatelier's_principle, the addition of acetate ions
from sodium acetate will suppress the ionization of acetic acid and shift its
equilibrium to the left. Thus the percent dissociation of the acetic acid will
decrease, and the pH of the solution will increase. The ionization of an acid
or a base is limited by the presence of its conjugate base or acid.
      NaCH3CO2(s) â Na+(aq) + CH3CO2â(aq)
      CH3CO2H(aq) â H+(aq) + CH3CO2â(aq)
This will decrease the hydronium concentration, and thus the common-ion
solution will be less acidic than a solution containing only acetic acid.
***** Exceptions[edit] *****
Many transition-metal compounds violate this rule due to the formation of
complex ions, a scenario not part of the equilibria that are involved in simple
precipitation of salts from ionic solution. For example, copper(I)_chloride is
insoluble in water, but it dissolves when chloride ions are added, such as when
hydrochloric_acid is added. This is due to the formation of soluble CuCl2â
complex ions.
***** Uncommon-ion effect[edit] *****
Sometimes adding an ion other than the ones that are part of the precipitated
salt itself can increase the solubility of the salt. This "salting_in" is
called the "uncommon-ion effect" (also "salt effect" or the "diverse-ion
effect"). It occurs because as the total ion concentration increases, inter-ion
attraction within the solution can become an important factor.[3] This
alternate equilibrium makes the ions less available for the precipitation
reaction. This is also called odd ion effect.
