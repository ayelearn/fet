In a chemical_reaction, chemical equilibrium is the state in which both
reactants and products are present in concentrations which have no further
tendency to change with time, so that there is no observable change in the
properties of the system.[1] Usually, this state results when the forward
reaction proceeds at the same rate as the reverse_reaction. The reaction_rates
of the forward and backward reactions are generally not zero, but equal. Thus,
there are no net changes in the concentrations of the reactant(s) and product
(s). Such a state is known as dynamic_equilibrium.[2][3]

***** Historical introduction[edit] *****
The concept of chemical equilibrium was developed after Berthollet (1803) found
that some chemical_reactions are reversible.[4] For any reaction mixture to
exist at equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward (reverse) reactions
are equal. In the following chemical_equation with arrows pointing both ways to
indicate equilibrium,[5] A and B are reactant chemical species, S and T are
product species, and Î±, Î², Ï, and Ï are the stoichiometric_coefficients of
the respective reactants and products:
      Î± A + Î² B â Ï S + Ï T
The equilibrium concentration position of a reaction is said to lie "far to the
right" if, at equilibrium, nearly all the reactants are consumed. Conversely
the equilibrium position is said to be "far to the left" if hardly any product
is formed from the reactants.
Guldberg and Waage (1865), building on Berthollet's ideas, proposed the law_of
mass_action:
              forward reaction rate     =  k  +     A   &#x03B1;     B
      &#x03B2;        backward reaction rate     =  k  &#x2212;     S
      &#x03C3;     T   &#x03C4;         {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\text
      {forward reaction rate}}&=k_{+}{\ce {A}}^{\alpha }{\ce {B}}^{\beta }\\
      {\text{backward reaction rate}}&=k_{-}{\ce {S}}^{\sigma }{\ce {T}}^{\tau
      }\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\text{forward reaction
      rate}}&=k_{+}{\ce {A}}^{\alpha }{\ce {B}}^{\beta }\\{\text{backward
      reaction rate}}&=k_{-}{\ce {S}}^{\sigma }{\ce {T}}^{\tau }\end
      {aligned}}}]
where A, B, S and T are active_masses and k+ and kâ are rate_constants. Since
at equilibrium forward and backward rates are equal:
          k  +     {  A  }   &#x03B1;     {  B  }   &#x03B2;   =  k  &#x2212;
      {  S  }   &#x03C3;     {  T  }   &#x03C4;     {\displaystyle k_{+}\left\{
      {\ce {A}}\right\}^{\alpha }\left\{{\ce {B}}\right\}^{\beta }=k_{-}\left\{
      {\ce {S}}\right\}^{\sigma }\left\{{\ce {T}}\right\}^{\tau }}  [
      {\displaystyle k_{+}\left\{{\ce {A}}\right\}^{\alpha }\left\{{\ce
      {B}}\right\}^{\beta }=k_{-}\left\{{\ce {S}}\right\}^{\sigma }\left\{{\ce
      {T}}\right\}^{\tau }}]
and the ratio of the rate constants is also a constant, now known as an
equilibrium_constant.
          K  c   =    k  +    k  &#x2212;     =    {  S   }  &#x03C3;   {  T
      }  &#x03C4;     {  A   }  &#x03B1;   {  B   }  &#x03B2;
      {\displaystyle K_{c}={\frac {k_{+}}{k_{-}}}={\frac {\{{\ce {S}}\}^{\sigma
      }\{{\ce {T}}\}^{\tau }}{\{{\ce {A}}\}^{\alpha }\{{\ce {B}}\}^{\beta }}}}
      [{\displaystyle K_{c}={\frac {k_{+}}{k_{-}}}={\frac {\{{\ce {S}}\}^
      {\sigma }\{{\ce {T}}\}^{\tau }}{\{{\ce {A}}\}^{\alpha }\{{\ce {B}}\}^
      {\beta }}}}]
By convention the products form the numerator. However, the law_of_mass_action
is valid only for concerted one-step reactions that proceed through a single
transition_state and is not valid in general because rate_equations do not, in
general, follow the stoichiometry of the reaction as Guldberg and Waage had
proposed (see, for example, nucleophilic_aliphatic_substitution by SN1 or
reaction of hydrogen and bromine to form hydrogen_bromide). Equality of forward
and backward reaction rates, however, is a necessary_condition for chemical
equilibrium, though it is not sufficient to explain why equilibrium occurs.
Despite the failure of this derivation, the equilibrium constant for a reaction
is indeed a constant, independent of the activities of the various species
involved, though it does depend on temperature as observed by the van_'t_Hoff
equation. Adding a catalyst will affect both the forward reaction and the
reverse reaction in the same way and will not have an effect on the equilibrium
constant. The catalyst will speed up both reactions thereby increasing the
speed at which equilibrium is reached.[2][6]
Although the macroscopic equilibrium concentrations are constant in time,
reactions do occur at the molecular level. For example, in the case of acetic
acid dissolved in water and forming acetate and hydronium ions,
      CH3CO2H + H2O â CH
      3COâ
      2 + H3O+
a proton may hop from one molecule of acetic acid on to a water molecule and
then on to an acetate anion to form another molecule of acetic acid and leaving
the number of acetic acid molecules unchanged. This is an example of dynamic
equilibrium. Equilibria, like the rest of thermodynamics, are statistical
phenomena, averages of microscopic behavior.
Le_ChÃ¢telier's_principle (1884) predicts the behavior of an equilibrium system
when changes to its reaction conditions occur. If a dynamic equilibrium is
disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to
partially reverse the change. For example, adding more S from the outside will
cause an excess of products, and the system will try to counteract this by
increasing the reverse reaction and pushing the equilibrium point backward
(though the equilibrium constant will stay the same).
If mineral_acid is added to the acetic acid mixture, increasing the
concentration of hydronium ion, the amount of dissociation must decrease as the
reaction is driven to the left in accordance with this principle. This can also
be deduced from the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:
         K =    {   CH  3       CO  2   &#x2212;    } {   H  3       O  +    }
      {  CH  3       CO  2      H }       {\displaystyle K={\frac {\{{\ce
      {CH3CO2-}}\}\{{\ce {H3O+}}\}}{{\ce {\{CH3CO2H\}}}}}}  [{\displaystyle K=
      {\frac {\{{\ce {CH3CO2-}}\}\{{\ce {H3O+}}\}}{{\ce {\{CH3CO2H\}}}}}}]
If {H3O+} increases {CH3CO2H} must increase and CH
3COâ
2 must decrease. The H2O is left out, as it is the solvent and its
concentration remains high and nearly constant.
A quantitative version is given by the reaction_quotient.
J._W._Gibbs suggested in 1873 that equilibrium is attained when the Gibbs_free
energy of the system is at its minimum value (assuming the reaction is carried
out at constant temperature and pressure). What this means is that the
derivative of the Gibbs energy with respect to reaction_coordinate (a measure
of the extent_of_reaction that has occurred, ranging from zero for all
reactants to a maximum for all products) vanishes, signaling a stationary
point. This derivative is called the reaction Gibbs energy (or energy change)
and corresponds to the difference between the chemical_potentials of reactants
and products at the composition of the reaction mixture.[1] This criterion is
both necessary and sufficient. If a mixture is not at equilibrium, the
liberation of the excess Gibbs energy (or Helmholtz_energy at constant volume
reactions) is the "driving force" for the composition of the mixture to change
until equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium constant can be related to the
standard Gibbs_free_energy change for the reaction by the equation
          &#x0394;  r    G  &#x2296;   = &#x2212; R T ln &#x2061;  K   e q
      {\displaystyle \Delta _{r}G^{\ominus }=-RT\ln K_{\mathrm {eq} }}  [
      {\displaystyle \Delta _{r}G^{\ominus }=-RT\ln K_{\mathrm {eq} }}]
where R is the universal_gas_constant and T the temperature.
When the reactants are dissolved in a medium of high ionic_strength the
quotient of activity_coefficients may be taken to be constant. In that case the
concentration quotient, Kc,
          K  c   =    [  S   ]  &#x03C3;   [  T   ]  &#x03C4;     [  A   ]
      &#x03B1;   [  B   ]  &#x03B2;        {\displaystyle K_{\ce {c}}={\frac {[
      {\ce {S}}]^{\sigma }[{\ce {T}}]^{\tau }}{[{\ce {A}}]^{\alpha }[{\ce
      {B}}]^{\beta }}}}  [{\displaystyle K_{\ce {c}}={\frac {[{\ce {S}}]^
      {\sigma }[{\ce {T}}]^{\tau }}{[{\ce {A}}]^{\alpha }[{\ce {B}}]^{\beta
      }}}}]
where [A] is the concentration of A, etc., is independent of the analytical
concentration of the reactants. For this reason, equilibrium constants for
solutions are usually determined in media of high ionic strength. Kc varies
with ionic_strength, temperature and pressure (or volume). Likewise Kp for
gases depends on partial_pressure. These constants are easier to measure and
encountered in high-school chemistry courses.
***** Thermodynamics[edit] *****
At constant temperature and pressure, one must consider the Gibbs_free_energy,
G, while at constant temperature and volume, one must consider the Helmholtz
free_energy, A, for the reaction; and at constant internal energy and volume,
one must consider the entropy, S, for the reaction.
The constant volume case is important in geochemistry and atmospheric_chemistry
where pressure variations are significant. Note that, if reactants and products
were in standard_state (completely pure), then there would be no reversibility
and no equilibrium. Indeed, they would necessarily occupy disjoint volumes of
space. The mixing of the products and reactants contributes a large entropy
(known as entropy_of_mixing) to states containing equal mixture of products and
reactants. The standard Gibbs energy change, together with the Gibbs energy of
mixing, determine the equilibrium state.[7][8]
In this article only the constant pressure case is considered. The relation
between the Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant can be found by
considering chemical_potentials.[1]
At constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs_free_energy, G, for the
reaction depends only on the extent_of_reaction: Î¾ (Greek letter xi), and can
only decrease according to the second_law_of_thermodynamics. It means that the
derivative of G with Î¾ must be negative if the reaction happens; at the
equilibrium the derivative being equal to zero.
           (    d G   d &#x03BE;    )   T , p   = 0 &#xA0;   {\displaystyle
      \left({\frac {dG}{d\xi }}\right)_{T,p}=0~}  [\left({\frac {dG}{d\xi
      }}\right)_{T,p}=0~]:     equilibrium
In order to meet the thermodynamic condition for equilibrium, the Gibbs energy
must be stationary, meaning that the derivative of G with respect to the extent
of_reaction: Î¾, must be zero. It can be shown that in this case, the sum of
chemical_potentials of the products is equal to the sum of those corresponding
to the reactants. Therefore, the sum of the Gibbs energies of the reactants
must be the equal to the sum of the Gibbs energies of the products.
         &#x03B1;  &#x03BC;   A    + &#x03B2;  &#x03BC;   B    = &#x03C3;
      &#x03BC;   S    + &#x03C4;  &#x03BC;   T       {\displaystyle \alpha \mu
      _{\mathrm {A} }+\beta \mu _{\mathrm {B} }=\sigma \mu _{\mathrm {S} }+\tau
      \mu _{\mathrm {T} }\,}  [{\displaystyle \alpha \mu _{\mathrm {A} }+\beta
      \mu _{\mathrm {B} }=\sigma \mu _{\mathrm {S} }+\tau \mu _{\mathrm {T}
      }\,}]
where Î¼ is in this case a partial molar Gibbs energy, a chemical_potential.
The chemical potential of a reagent A is a function of the activity, {A} of
that reagent.
          &#x03BC;   A    =  &#x03BC;  A   &#x2296;   + R T ln &#x2061; {  A  }
      {\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {A} }=\mu _{A}^{\ominus }+RT\ln\{\mathrm {A}
      \}\,}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {A} }=\mu _{A}^{\ominus }+RT\ln\
      {\mathrm {A} \}\,}]
(where Î¼o
A is the standard chemical potential).
The definition of the Gibbs_energy equation interacts with the fundamental
thermodynamic_relation to produce
         d G = V d p &#x2212; S d T +  &#x2211;  i = 1   k    &#x03BC;  i   d
      N  i     {\displaystyle dG=Vdp-SdT+\sum _{i=1}^{k}\mu _{i}dN_{i}}
      [dG=Vdp-SdT+\sum _{i=1}^{k}\mu _{i}dN_{i}].
Inserting dNi = Î½i dÎ¾ into the above equation gives a Stoichiometric
coefficient (     &#x03BD;  i   &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \nu _{i}~}  [\nu _
{i}~]) and a differential that denotes the reaction occurring once (dÎ¾). At
constant pressure and temperature the above equations can be written as
           (    d G   d &#x03BE;    )   T , p   =  &#x2211;  i = 1   k
      &#x03BC;  i    &#x03BD;  i   =  &#x0394;   r     G  T , p
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dG}{d\xi }}\right)_{T,p}=\sum _{i=1}^{k}\mu
      _{i}\nu _{i}=\Delta _{\mathrm {r} }G_{T,p}}  [{\displaystyle \left({\frac
      {dG}{d\xi }}\right)_{T,p}=\sum _{i=1}^{k}\mu _{i}\nu _{i}=\Delta _
      {\mathrm {r} }G_{T,p}}] which is the "Gibbs free energy change for the
      reaction.
This results in:
          &#x0394;   r     G  T , p   = &#x03C3;  &#x03BC;   S    + &#x03C4;
      &#x03BC;   T    &#x2212; &#x03B1;  &#x03BC;   A    &#x2212; &#x03B2;
      &#x03BC;   B       {\displaystyle \Delta _{\mathrm {r} }G_{T,p}=\sigma
      \mu _{\mathrm {S} }+\tau \mu _{\mathrm {T} }-\alpha \mu _{\mathrm {A} }-
      \beta \mu _{\mathrm {B} }\,}  [{\displaystyle \Delta _{\mathrm {r} }G_
      {T,p}=\sigma \mu _{\mathrm {S} }+\tau \mu _{\mathrm {T} }-\alpha \mu _
      {\mathrm {A} }-\beta \mu _{\mathrm {B} }\,}].
By substituting the chemical potentials:
          &#x0394;   r     G  T , p   = ( &#x03C3;  &#x03BC;   S    &#x2296;
      + &#x03C4;  &#x03BC;   T    &#x2296;   ) &#x2212; ( &#x03B1;  &#x03BC;

      ln &#x2061; {  S  } + &#x03C4; R T ln &#x2061; {  T  } ) &#x2212;
      ( &#x03B1; R T ln &#x2061; {  A  } + &#x03B2; R T ln &#x2061; {  B  } )
      {\displaystyle \Delta _{\mathrm {r} }G_{T,p}=(\sigma \mu _{\mathrm {S} }^
      {\ominus }+\tau \mu _{\mathrm {T} }^{\ominus })-(\alpha \mu _{\mathrm {A}

      RT\ln\{\mathrm {B} \})}  [{\displaystyle \Delta _{\mathrm {r} }G_{T,p}=
      (\sigma \mu _{\mathrm {S} }^{\ominus }+\tau \mu _{\mathrm {T} }^{\ominus
      })-(\alpha \mu _{\mathrm {A} }^{\ominus }+\beta \mu _{\mathrm {B} }^
      {\ominus })+(\sigma RT\ln\{\mathrm {S} \}+\tau RT\ln\{\mathrm {T} \})-
      (\alpha RT\ln\{\mathrm {A} \}+\beta RT\ln\{\mathrm {B} \})}],
the relationship becomes:

      {\ominus }}]:
which is the standard Gibbs energy change for the reaction that can be
calculated using thermodynamical tables. The reaction_quotient is defined as:
          Q   r    =    {  S   }  &#x03C3;   {  T   }  &#x03C4;     {  A   }

      }={\frac {\{\mathrm {S} \}^{\sigma }\{\mathrm {T} \}^{\tau }}{\{\mathrm

Therefore,
           (    d G   d &#x03BE;    )   T , p   =  &#x0394;   r     G  T , p
      =  &#x0394;   r     G  &#x2296;   + R T ln &#x2061;  Q   r

At equilibrium:

leading to:

Obtaining the value of the standard Gibbs energy change, allows the calculation
of the equilibrium constant.

            Q_{\mathrm {r} }={\frac {\prod (a_{j})^{\nu _{j}}}{\prod (a_{i})^
            {\nu _{i}}}}~}  [{\displaystyle Q_{\mathrm {r} }={\frac {\prod (a_
            {j})^{\nu _{j}}}{\prod (a_{i})^{\nu _{i}}}}~}], the reaction
            quotient decreases.
      then
                Q   r    <  K   e q    &#xA0;   {\displaystyle Q_{\mathrm {r}
            }<K_{\mathrm {eq} }~}  [{\displaystyle Q_{\mathrm {r} }<K_{\mathrm
            {eq} }~}]     and           (    d G   d &#x03BE;    )   T , p   <
            0 &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dG}{d\xi }}\right)_
            {T,p}<0~}  [\left({\frac {dG}{d\xi }}\right)_{T,p}<0~]
      The reaction will shift to the right (i.e. in the forward direction, and
      thus more products will form).
    * If activity of a product j increases
      then
                Q   r    >  K   e q    &#xA0;   {\displaystyle Q_{\mathrm {r}
            }>K_{\mathrm {eq} }~}  [{\displaystyle Q_{\mathrm {r} }>K_{\mathrm
            {eq} }~}]     and           (    d G   d &#x03BE;    )   T , p   >
            0 &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \left({\frac {dG}{d\xi }}\right)_
            {T,p}>0~}  [\left({\frac {dG}{d\xi }}\right)_{T,p}>0~]
      The reaction will shift to the left (i.e. in the reverse direction, and
      thus less products will form).
Note that activities and equilibrium constants are dimensionless numbers.
**** Treatment of activity[edit] ****
The expression for the equilibrium constant can be rewritten as the product of
a concentration quotient, Kc and an activity_coefficient quotient, Î.
         K =    [  S   ]  &#x03C3;   [  T   ]  &#x03C4;   . . .   [  A   ]
      &#x03B1;   [  B   ]  &#x03B2;   . . .    &#x00D7;       &#x03B3;   S
      &#x03C3;      &#x03B3;   T      &#x03C4;   . . .      &#x03B3;   A
      &#x03B1;      &#x03B3;   B      &#x03B2;   . . .    =  K   c    &#x0393;
      {\displaystyle K={\frac {[\mathrm {S} ]^{\sigma }[\mathrm {T} ]^{\tau
      }...}{[\mathrm {A} ]^{\alpha }[\mathrm {B} ]^{\beta }...}}\times {\frac {
      {\gamma _{\mathrm {S} }}^{\sigma }{\gamma _{\mathrm {T} }}^{\tau }...}{
      {\gamma _{\mathrm {A} }}^{\alpha }{\gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}^{\beta
      }...}}=K_{\mathrm {c} }\Gamma }  [{\displaystyle K={\frac {[\mathrm {S}
      ]^{\sigma }[\mathrm {T} ]^{\tau }...}{[\mathrm {A} ]^{\alpha }[\mathrm
      {B} ]^{\beta }...}}\times {\frac {{\gamma _{\mathrm {S} }}^{\sigma }
      {\gamma _{\mathrm {T} }}^{\tau }...}{{\gamma _{\mathrm {A} }}^{\alpha }
      {\gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}^{\beta }...}}=K_{\mathrm {c} }\Gamma }]
[A] is the concentration of reagent A, etc. It is possible in principle to
obtain values of the activity coefficients, Î³. For solutions, equations such
as the DebyeâHÃ¼ckel_equation or extensions such as Davies_equation[9]
Specific_ion_interaction_theory or Pitzer_equations[10] may be used.Software_
(below) However this is not always possible. It is common practice to assume
that Î is a constant, and to use the concentration quotient in place of the
thermodynamic equilibrium constant. It is also general practice to use the term
equilibrium constant instead of the more accurate concentration quotient. This
practice will be followed here.
For reactions in the gas phase partial_pressure is used in place of
concentration and fugacity_coefficient in place of activity coefficient. In the
real world, for example, when making ammonia in industry, fugacity coefficients
must be taken into account. Fugacity, f, is the product of partial pressure and
fugacity coefficient. The chemical potential of a species in the gas phase is
given by
         &#x03BC; =  &#x03BC;  &#x2296;   + R T ln &#x2061;  (   f  b a r    )
      =  &#x03BC;  &#x2296;   + R T ln &#x2061;  (   p  b a r    )  + R T ln
      &#x2061; &#x03B3;   {\displaystyle \mu =\mu ^{\ominus }+RT\ln \left(
      {\frac {f}{\mathrm {bar} }}\right)=\mu ^{\ominus }+RT\ln \left({\frac {p}
      {\mathrm {bar} }}\right)+RT\ln \gamma }  [{\displaystyle \mu =\mu ^
      {\ominus }+RT\ln \left({\frac {f}{\mathrm {bar} }}\right)=\mu ^{\ominus
      }+RT\ln \left({\frac {p}{\mathrm {bar} }}\right)+RT\ln \gamma }]
so the general expression defining an equilibrium constant is valid for both
solution and gas phases.
**** Concentration quotients[edit] ****
In aqueous solution, equilibrium constants are usually determined in the
presence of an "inert" electrolyte such as sodium_nitrate NaNO3 or potassium
perchlorate KClO4. The ionic_strength of a solution is given by
         I =   1 2    &#x2211;  i = 1   N    c  i    z  i   2
      {\displaystyle I={\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}c_{i}z_{i}^{2}}  [
      {\displaystyle I={\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}c_{i}z_{i}^{2}}]
where ci and zi stand for the concentration and ionic charge of ion type i, and
the sum is taken over all the N types of charged species in solution. When the
concentration of dissolved salt is much higher than the analytical
concentrations of the reagents, the ions originating from the dissolved salt
determine the ionic strength, and the ionic strength is effectively constant.
Since activity coefficients depend on ionic strength the activity coefficients
of the species are effectively independent of concentration. Thus, the
assumption that Î is constant is justified. The concentration quotient is a
simple multiple of the equilibrium constant.[11]
          K   c    =   K &#x0393;     {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {c} }={\frac
      {K}{\Gamma }}}  [{\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {c} }={\frac {K}{\Gamma }}}]
However, Kc will vary with ionic strength. If it is measured at a series of
different ionic strengths the value can be extrapolated to zero ionic strength.
[10] The concentration quotient obtained in this manner is known,
paradoxically, as a thermodynamic equilibrium constant.
To use a published value of an equilibrium constant in conditions of ionic
strength different from the conditions used in its determination, the value
should be adjustedSoftware_(below).
**** Metastable mixtures[edit] ****
A mixture may appear to have no tendency to change, though it is not at
equilibrium. For example, a mixture of SO2 and O2 is metastable as there is a
kinetic_barrier to formation of the product, SO3.
      2 SO2 + O2 â 2 SO3
The barrier can be overcome when a catalyst is also present in the mixture as
in the contact_process, but the catalyst does not affect the equilibrium
concentrations.
Likewise, the formation of bicarbonate from carbon_dioxide and water is very
slow under normal conditions
      CO2 + 2 H2O â HCOâ
      3 + H3O+
but almost instantaneous in the presence of the catalytic enzyme carbonic
anhydrase.
***** Pure substances[edit] *****
When pure substances (liquids or solids) are involved in equilibria their
activities do not appear in the equilibrium constant[12] because their
numerical values are considered one.
Applying the general formula for an equilibrium constant to the specific case
of a dilute solution of acetic acid in water one obtains
      CH3CO2H + H2O â CH3CO2â + H3O+
          K   c    =    [   C  H  3   C  O  2     &#x2212;   ] [    H  3   O
      +   ]   [  C  H  3   C  O  2   H  ] [   H  2   O  ]      {\displaystyle
      K_{\mathrm {c} }={\frac {\mathrm {[{CH_{3}CO_{2}}^{-}][{H_{3}O}^{+}]} }
      {\mathrm {[{CH_{3}CO_{2}H}][{H_{2}O}]} }}}  [{\displaystyle K_{\mathrm
      {c} }={\frac {\mathrm {[{CH_{3}CO_{2}}^{-}][{H_{3}O}^{+}]} }{\mathrm {[
      {CH_{3}CO_{2}H}][{H_{2}O}]} }}}]
For all but very concentrated solutions, the water can be considered a "pure"
liquid, and therefore it has an activity of one. The equilibrium constant
expression is therefore usually written as
         K =    [   C  H  3   C  O  2     &#x2212;   ] [    H  3   O   +   ]
      [  C  H  3   C  O  2   H  ]    =  K   c      {\displaystyle K={\frac
      {\mathrm {[{CH_{3}CO_{2}}^{-}][{H_{3}O}^{+}]} }{\mathrm {[{CH_{3}CO_
      {2}H}]} }}=K_{\mathrm {c} }}  [{\displaystyle K={\frac {\mathrm {[{CH_
      {3}CO_{2}}^{-}][{H_{3}O}^{+}]} }{\mathrm {[{CH_{3}CO_{2}H}]} }}=K_
      {\mathrm {c} }}].
A particular case is the self-ionization_of_water itself
      2 H2O â H3O+ + OHâ
Because water is the solvent, and has an activity of one, the self-ionization
constant of water is defined as
          K   w    =  [  H  +   ] [ O  H  &#x2212;   ]    {\displaystyle K_
      {\mathrm {w} }=\mathrm {[H^{+}][OH^{-}]} }  [{\displaystyle K_{\mathrm
      {w} }=\mathrm {[H^{+}][OH^{-}]} }]
It is perfectly legitimate to write [H+] for the hydronium_ion concentration,
since the state of solvation of the proton is constant (in dilute solutions)
and so does not affect the equilibrium concentrations. Kw varies with variation
in ionic strength and/or temperature.
The concentrations of H+ and OHâ are not independent quantities. Most
commonly [OHâ] is replaced by Kw[H+]â1 in equilibrium constant expressions
which would otherwise include hydroxide_ion.
Solids also do not appear in the equilibrium constant expression, if they are
considered to be pure and thus their activities taken to be one. An example is
the Boudouard_reaction:[12]
      2 CO â CO2 + C
for which the equation (without solid carbon) is written as:
          K   c    =    [ C  O  2   ]   [ C O  ]  2        {\displaystyle K_
      {\mathrm {c} }={\frac {\mathrm {[CO_{2}]} }{\mathrm {[CO]^{2}} }}}  [
      {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {c} }={\frac {\mathrm {[CO_{2}]} }{\mathrm {
      [CO]^{2}} }}}]
***** Multiple equilibria[edit] *****
Consider the case of a dibasic acid H2A. When dissolved in water, the mixture
will contain H2A, HAâ and A2â. This equilibrium can be split into two steps
in each of which one proton is liberated.
               H  2      A       &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;
      &#x21C0;        HA  &#x2212;   +  H  +    :    K  1   =     [ HA
      &#x2212;  ]   [  H  +   ]     [  H  2      A ]           HA  &#x2212;
      &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;     &#x21C0;        A  2 &#x2212;
      +  H  +    :    K  2   =     [  A  2   &#x2212;    ]   [  H  +   ]
      [ HA  &#x2212;  ]           {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rl}{\ce {H2A
      <=> HA^- + H+}}:&K_{1}={\frac {{\ce {[HA-][H+]}}}{{\ce {[H2A]}}}}\\{\ce
      {HA- <=> A^2- + H+}}:&K_{2}={\frac {{\ce {[A^{2-}][H+]}}}{{\ce {[HA-
      ]}}}}\end{array}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rl}{\ce {H2A <=> HA^-
      + H+}}:&K_{1}={\frac {{\ce {[HA-][H+]}}}{{\ce {[H2A]}}}}\\{\ce {HA- <=>
      A^2- + H+}}:&K_{2}={\frac {{\ce {[A^{2-}][H+]}}}{{\ce {[HA-]}}}}\end
      {array}}}]
K1 andK2 are examples of stepwise equilibrium constants. The overall
equilibrium constant, Î²D, is product of the stepwise constants.
            H  2      A        &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;
      &#x21C0;         A  2   &#x2212;     +  2   H  +       {\displaystyle
      {\ce {{H2A}<=>{A^{2-}}+{2H+}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {{H2A}<=>{A^{2-}}+
      {2H+}}}}]:          &#x03B2;   D    =     [  A  2   &#x2212;    ]    [  H
      +   ]   2      [  H  2      A ]     =  K  1    K  2     {\displaystyle
      \beta _{{\ce {D}}}={\frac {{\ce {[A^{2-}][H^+]^2}}}{{\ce {[H_2A]}}}}=K_
      {1}K_{2}}  [{\displaystyle \beta _{{\ce {D}}}={\frac {{\ce {[A^{2-}]
      [H^+]^2}}}{{\ce {[H_2A]}}}}=K_{1}K_{2}}]
Note that these constants are dissociation_constants because the products on
the right hand side of the equilibrium expression are dissociation products. In
many systems, it is preferable to use association constants.
               A  2 &#x2212;   +  H  +         &#x21BD;     &#x2212;
      &#x2212;     &#x21C0;        HA  &#x2212;    :    &#x03B2;  1   =
      [ HA  &#x2212;  ]     [  A  2   &#x2212;    ]   [  H  +   ]           A
      2 &#x2212;   + 2   H  +         &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;
      &#x21C0;        H  2      A  :    &#x03B2;  2   =     [  H  2      A ]
      [  A  2   &#x2212;    ]    [  H  +   ]   2            {\displaystyle
      {\begin{array}{ll}{\ce {A^2- + H+ <=> HA-}}:&\beta _{1}={\frac {{\ce {
      [HA^-]}}}{{\ce {[A^{2-}][H+]}}}}\\{\ce {A^2- + 2H+ <=> H2A}}:&\beta _{2}=
      {\frac {{\ce {[H2A]}}}{{\ce {[A^{2-}][H+]^2}}}}\end{array}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{ll}{\ce {A^2- + H+ <=> HA-}}:&\beta _{1}=
      {\frac {{\ce {[HA^-]}}}{{\ce {[A^{2-}][H+]}}}}\\{\ce {A^2- + 2H+ <=>
      H2A}}:&\beta _{2}={\frac {{\ce {[H2A]}}}{{\ce {[A^{2-}][H+]^2}}}}\end
      {array}}}]
Î²1 and Î²2 are examples of association constants. Clearly Î²1 = 1/K2 and
Î²2 = 1/Î²D; log Î²1 = pK2 and log Î²2 = pK2 + pK1[13] For multiple equilibrium
systems, also see: theory of Response_reactions.
***** Effect of temperature[edit] *****
The effect of changing temperature on an equilibrium constant is given by the
van_'t_Hoff_equation
            d ln &#x2061; K   d T    =    &#x0394;  H   m    &#x2296;     R  T
      2        {\displaystyle {\frac {d\ln K}{dT}}={\frac {\Delta H_{\mathrm
      {m} }^{\ominus }}{RT^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {d\ln K}{dT}}={\frac
      {\Delta H_{\mathrm {m} }^{\ominus }}{RT^{2}}}}]
Thus, for exothermic reactions (ÎH is negative), K decreases with an increase
in temperature, but, for endothermic reactions, (ÎH is positive) K increases
with an increase temperature. An alternative formulation is
            d ln &#x2061; K   d (  T  &#x2212; 1   )    = &#x2212;    &#x0394;
      H   m    &#x2296;    R     {\displaystyle {\frac {d\ln K}{d(T^{-1})}}=-
      {\frac {\Delta H_{\mathrm {m} }^{\ominus }}{R}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {d\ln K}{d(T^{-1})}}=-{\frac {\Delta H_{\mathrm {m} }^{\ominus }}{R}}}]
At first sight this appears to offer a means of obtaining the standard molar
enthalpy of the reaction by studying the variation of K with temperature. In
practice, however, the method is unreliable because error propagation almost
always gives very large errors on the values calculated in this way.
***** Effect of electric and magnetic fields[edit] *****

Equilibrium can be broadly classified as heterogeneous and homogeneous
equilibrium[14]. Homogeneous equilibrium consists of reactants and products
belonging in the same phase whereas heterogeneous equilibrium comes into play
for reactants and products in different phases.
    * In the gas phase: rocket_engines[15]

    * The related Nernst_equation in electrochemistry gives the difference in

    * When molecules on each side of the equilibrium are able to further react
      irreversibly in secondary reactions, the final product ratio is
      determined according to the CurtinâHammett_principle.
In these applications, terms such as stability constant, formation constant,
binding constant, affinity constant, association/dissociation constant are
used. In biochemistry, it is common to give units for binding constants, which
serve to define the concentration units used when the constant's value was
determined.
***** Composition of a mixture[edit] *****
When the only equilibrium is that of the formation of a 1:1 adduct as the
composition of a mixture, there are many ways that the composition of a mixture
can be calculated. For example, see ICE_table for a traditional method of
calculating the pH of a solution of a weak acid.
There are three approaches to the general calculation of the composition of a
mixture at equilibrium.
   1. The most basic approach is to manipulate the various equilibrium
      constants until the desired concentrations are expressed in terms of
      measured equilibrium constants (equivalent to measuring chemical
      potentials) and initial conditions.
   2. Minimize the Gibbs energy of the system.[16][17]
   3. Satisfy the equation of mass_balance. The equations of mass balance are
      simply statements that demonstrate that the total concentration of each
      reactant must be constant by the law of conservation_of_mass.
**** Mass-balance equations[edit] ****
In general, the calculations are rather complicated or complex. For instance,
in the case of a dibasic acid, H2A dissolved in water the two reactants can be
specified as the conjugate_base, A2â, and the proton, H+. The following
equations of mass-balance could apply equally well to a base such as 1,2-
diaminoethane, in which case the base itself is designated as the reactant A:
          T   A    =  [ A ] + [ H A ] + [  H  2   A ]     {\displaystyle T_
      {\mathrm {A} }=\mathrm {[A]+[HA]+[H_{2}A]} \,}  [{\displaystyle T_
      {\mathrm {A} }=\mathrm {[A]+[HA]+[H_{2}A]} \,}]
          T   H    =  [ H ] + [ H A ] + 2 [  H  2   A ] &#x2212; [ O H ]
      {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {H} }=\mathrm {[H]+[HA]+2[H_{2}A]-[OH]} \,}  [
      {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {H} }=\mathrm {[H]+[HA]+2[H_{2}A]-[OH]} \,}]
With TA the total concentration of species A. Note that it is customary to omit
the ionic charges when writing and using these equations.
When the equilibrium constants are known and the total concentrations are
specified there are two equations in two unknown "free concentrations" [A] and
[H]. This follows from the fact that [HA] = Î²1[A][H], [H2A] = Î²2[A][H]2 and
[OH] = Kw[H]â1
          T   A    =  [ A ]  +  &#x03B2;  1    [ A ] [ H ]  +  &#x03B2;  2
      [ A ] [ H ]   2      {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {A} }=\mathrm {[A]} +\beta
      _{1}\mathrm {[A][H]} +\beta _{2}\mathrm {[A][H]} ^{2}\,}  [{\displaystyle
      T_{\mathrm {A} }=\mathrm {[A]} +\beta _{1}\mathrm {[A][H]} +\beta _
      {2}\mathrm {[A][H]} ^{2}\,}]
          T   H    =  [ H ]  +  &#x03B2;  1    [ A ] [ H ]  + 2  &#x03B2;  2
      [ A ] [ H ]   2   &#x2212;  K  w   [  H   ]  &#x2212; 1
      {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {H} }=\mathrm {[H]} +\beta _{1}\mathrm {[A][H]}
      +2\beta _{2}\mathrm {[A][H]} ^{2}-K_{w}[\mathrm {H} ]^{-1}\,}  [
      {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {H} }=\mathrm {[H]} +\beta _{1}\mathrm {[A][H]}
      +2\beta _{2}\mathrm {[A][H]} ^{2}-K_{w}[\mathrm {H} ]^{-1}\,}]
so the concentrations of the "complexes" are calculated from the free
concentrations and the equilibrium constants. General expressions applicable to
all systems with two reagents, A and B would be
          T   A    = [  A  ] +  &#x2211;  i    p  i    &#x03B2;  i   [  A   ]
      p  i     [  B   ]   q  i       {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {A} }=[\mathrm

It is easy to see how this can be extended to three or more reagents.
*** Polybasic acids[edit] ***
Species concentrations during hydrolysis of the aluminium.
The composition of solutions containing reactants A and H is easy to calculate
as a function of p[H]. When [H] is known, the free concentration [A] is
calculated from the mass-balance equation in A.
The diagram alongside, shows an example of the hydrolysis of the aluminium
Lewis_acid Al3+(aq)[18] shows the species concentrations for a 5 Ã 10â6 M
solution of an aluminium salt as a function of pH. Each concentration is shown
as a percentage of the total aluminium.
*** Solution and precipitation[edit] ***
The diagram above illustrates the point that a precipitate that is not one of
the main species in the solution equilibrium may be formed. At pH just below
5.5 the main species present in a 5 Î¼M solution of Al3+ are aluminium
hydroxides Al(OH)2+, AlOH+
2 and Al
13(OH)7+
32, but on raising the pH Al(OH)3 precipitates from the solution. This occurs
because Al(OH)3 has a very large lattice_energy. As the pH rises more and more
Al(OH)3 comes out of solution. This is an example of Le_ChÃ¢telier's_principle
in action: Increasing the concentration of the hydroxide ion causes more
aluminium hydroxide to precipitate, which removes hydroxide from the solution.
When the hydroxide concentration becomes sufficiently high the soluble
aluminate, Al(OH)â
4, is formed.
Another common instance where precipitation occurs is when a metal cation
interacts with an anionic ligand to form an electrically neutral complex. If
the complex is hydrophobic, it will precipitate out of water. This occurs with
the nickel ion Ni2+ and dimethylglyoxime, (dmgH2): in this case the lattice
energy of the solid is not particularly large, but it greatly exceeds the
energy of solvation of the molecule Ni(dmgH)2.
**** Minimization of Gibbs energy[edit] ****
At equilibrium, at a specified temperature and pressure, the Gibbs energy G is
at a minimum:
         d G =  &#x2211;  j = 1   m    &#x03BC;  j    d  N  j   = 0
      {\displaystyle dG=\sum _{j=1}^{m}\mu _{j}\,dN_{j}=0}  [dG=\sum _{j=1}^
      {m}\mu _{j}\,dN_{j}=0]
For a closed system, no particles may enter or leave, although they may combine
in various ways. The total number of atoms of each element will remain
constant. This means that the minimization above must be subjected to the
constraints:
          &#x2211;  j = 1   m    a  i j    N  j   =  b  i   0
      {\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}N_{j}=b_{i}^{0}}  [\sum _{j=1}^{m}a_
      {ij}N_{j}=b_{i}^{0}]
where aij is the number of atoms of element i in molecule j and b0
i is the total number of atoms of element i, which is a constant, since the
system is closed. If there are a total of k types of atoms in the system, then
there will be k such equations. If ions are involved, an additional row is
added to the aij matrix specifying the respective charge on each molecule which
will sum to zero.
This is a standard problem in optimisation, known as constrained_minimisation.
The most common method of solving it is using the method of Lagrange
multipliers (though other methods may be used).
Define:
           G   = G +  &#x2211;  i = 1   k    &#x03BB;  i    (   &#x2211;  j = 1
      m    a  i j    N  j   &#x2212;  b  i   0    )  = 0   {\displaystyle
      {\mathcal {G}}=G+\sum _{i=1}^{k}\lambda _{i}\left(\sum _{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}N_
      {j}-b_{i}^{0}\right)=0}  [{\mathcal {G}}=G+\sum _{i=1}^{k}\lambda _
      {i}\left(\sum _{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}N_{j}-b_{i}^{0}\right)=0]
where the Î»i are the Lagrange multipliers, one for each element. This allows
each of the Nj and λj to be treated independently, and it can be shown using
the tools of multivariate_calculus that the equilibrium condition is given by
         0 =    &#x2202;   G     &#x2202;  N  j      =  &#x03BC;  j   +
      &#x2211;  i = 1   k    &#x03BB;  i    a  i j     {\displaystyle 0={\frac
      {\partial {\mathcal {G}}}{\partial N_{j}}}=\mu _{j}+\sum _{i=1}^
      {k}\lambda _{i}a_{ij}}  [{\displaystyle 0={\frac {\partial {\mathcal
      {G}}}{\partial N_{j}}}=\mu _{j}+\sum _{i=1}^{k}\lambda _{i}a_{ij}}]
         0 =    &#x2202;   G     &#x2202;  &#x03BB;  i      =  &#x2211;  j = 1
      m    a  i j    N  j   &#x2212;  b  i   0     {\displaystyle 0={\frac
      {\partial {\mathcal {G}}}{\partial \lambda _{i}}}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}N_
      {j}-b_{i}^{0}}  [{\displaystyle 0={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {G}}}
      {\partial \lambda _{i}}}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}N_{j}-b_{i}^{0}}]
(For proof see Lagrange_multipliers.) This is a set of (m + k) equations in
(m + k) unknowns (the Nj and the Î»i) and may, therefore, be solved for the
equilibrium concentrations Nj as long as the chemical potentials are known as
functions of the concentrations at the given temperature and pressure. (See
Thermodynamic_databases_for_pure_substances.) Note that the second equation is
just the initial constraints for minimization.
This method of calculating equilibrium chemical concentrations is useful for
systems with a large number of different molecules. The use of k atomic element
conservation equations for the mass constraint is straightforward, and replaces
the use of the stoichiometric coefficient equations.[15] The results are
consistent with those specified by chemical equations. For example, if
equilibrium is specified by a single chemical equation:,[19]
          &#x2211;  j = 0   m    &#x03BD;  j    R  j   = 0   {\displaystyle
      \sum _{j=0}^{m}\nu _{j}R_{j}=0}  [{\displaystyle \sum _{j=0}^{m}\nu _
      {j}R_{j}=0}]
where νj is the stochiometric coefficient for the j th molecule (negative for
reactants, positive for products) and Rj is the symbol for the j th molecule, a
properly balanced equation will obey:
          &#x2211;  j = 1   m    a  i j    &#x03BD;  j   = 0   {\displaystyle
      \sum _{j=1}^{m}a_{ij}\nu _{j}=0}  [{\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{m}a_
      {ij}\nu _{j}=0}]
Multiplying the first equilibrium condition by νj yields
         0 =  &#x2211;  j = 1   m    &#x03BD;  j    &#x03BC;  j   +  &#x2211;
      j = 1   m    &#x2211;  i = 1   k    &#x03BD;  j    &#x03BB;  i    a  i j
      =  &#x2211;  j = 1   m    &#x03BD;  j    &#x03BC;  j     {\displaystyle
      0=\sum _{j=1}^{m}\nu _{j}\mu _{j}+\sum _{j=1}^{m}\sum _{i=1}^{k}\nu _
      {j}\lambda _{i}a_{ij}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}\nu _{j}\mu _{j}}  [{\displaystyle
      0=\sum _{j=1}^{m}\nu _{j}\mu _{j}+\sum _{j=1}^{m}\sum _{i=1}^{k}\nu _
      {j}\lambda _{i}a_{ij}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}\nu _{j}\mu _{j}}]
As above, defining ΔG
         &#x0394; G =  &#x2211;  j = 1   m    &#x03BD;  j    &#x03BC;  j   =
      &#x2211;  j = 1   m    &#x03BD;  j   (  &#x03BC;  j   &#x2296;   + R T ln
      &#x2061; ( {  R  j   } ) ) = &#x0394;  G  &#x2296;   + R T ln &#x2061;
      (   &#x220F;  j = 1   m   {  R  j    }   &#x03BD;  j      )  = &#x0394;
      G  &#x2296;   + R T ln &#x2061; (  Q  r   )   {\displaystyle \Delta
      G=\sum _{j=1}^{m}\nu _{j}\mu _{j}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}\nu _{j}(\mu _{j}^
      {\ominus }+RT\ln(\{R_{j}\}))=\Delta G^{\ominus }+RT\ln \left(\prod _
      {j=1}^{m}\{R_{j}\}^{\nu _{j}}\right)=\Delta G^{\ominus }+RT\ln(Q_{r})}  [
      {\displaystyle \Delta G=\sum _{j=1}^{m}\nu _{j}\mu _{j}=\sum _{j=1}^
      {m}\nu _{j}(\mu _{j}^{\ominus }+RT\ln(\{R_{j}\}))=\Delta G^{\ominus
      }+RT\ln \left(\prod _{j=1}^{m}\{R_{j}\}^{\nu _{j}}\right)=\Delta G^
      {\ominus }+RT\ln(Q_{r})}]
which will be zero at equilibrium.

   6.  On pp. 404â407, Berthellot mentions that when he accompanied Napoleon
      on his expedition to Egypt, he (Berthellot) visited Lake Natron and found
      sodium carbonate along its shores. He realized that this was a product of
      the reverse of the usual reaction Na2CO3 + CaCl2 â 2NaCl + CaCO3â and
      therefore that the final state of a reaction was a state of equilibrium
      between two opposing processes. From p. 405: " â¦ la dÃ©composition du
      muriate de soude continue donc jusqu'Ã  ce qu'il se soit formÃ© assez de
      muriate de chaux, parce que l'acide muriatique devant se partager entre
      les deux bases en raison de leur action, il arrive un terme oÃ¹ leurs
      forces se balancent." ( â¦ the decomposition of the sodium chloride thus
      continues until enough calcium chloride is formed, because the
      hydrochloric acid must be shared between the two bases in the ratio of
      their action [i.e., capacity to react]; it reaches an end [point] at
      which their forces are balanced.)
   7. ^ The notation â was proposed in 1884 by the Dutch chemist Jacobus
      Henricus_van_'t_Hoff. See:van 't Hoff, J.H. (1884). Ãtudes_de_Dynamique
      Chemique [Studies of chemical dynamics] (in French). Amsterdam,
      Netherlands: Frederik Muller & Co. pp. 4â5.
   8.  Van 't Hoff called reactions that didn't proceed to completion "limited
      reactions". From pp. 4â5: "Or M. Pfaundler a reliÃ© ces deux
      phÃ©nomÃªnes â¦ s'accomplit en mÃªme temps dans deux sens opposÃ©s."
      (Now Mr. Pfaundler has joined these two phenomena in a single concept by
      considering the observed limit as the result of two opposing reactions,
      driving the one in the example cited to the formation of sea salt [i.e.,
      NaCl] and nitric acid, [and] the other to hydrochloric acid and sodium
      nitrate. This consideration, which experiment validates, justifies the
      expression "chemical equilibrium", which is used to characterize the
      final state of limited reactions. I would propose to translate this
      expression by the following symbol:
            HCl + NO3 Na â NO3 H + Cl Na .
   9. I thus replace, in this case, the = sign in the chemical equation by the
      sign â, which in reality doesn't express just equality but shows also
      the direction of the reaction. This clearly expresses that a chemical
      action occurs simultaneously in two opposing directions.)
