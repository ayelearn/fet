In chemistry, colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend on
the ratio of the number of solute particles to the number of solvent molecules
in a solution, and not on the nature of the chemical species present.[1] The
number ratio can be related to the various units for concentration of
solutions. The assumption that solution properties are independent of nature of
solute particles is only exact for ideal_solutions, and is approximate for
dilute real solutions. In other words, colligative properties are a set of
solution properties that can be reasonably approximated by assuming that the
solution is ideal.
Only properties which result from the dissolution of nonvolatile solute in a
volatile liquid solvent are considered.[2] They are essentially solvent
properties which are changed by the presence of the solute. The solute
particles displace some solvent molecules in the liquid phase and therefore
reduce the concentration of solvent, so that the colligative properties are
independent of the nature of the solute. The word colligative is derived from
the Latin colligatus meaning bound together.[3] This indicates that all
colligative properties have a common feature, namely that they are related only
to the number of solute molecules relative to the number of solvent molecules
and not to the nature of the solute.[4]
Colligative properties include:
    * Relative lowering of vapour_pressure
    * Elevation_of_boiling_point
    * Depression_of_freezing_point
    * Osmotic_pressure
For a given solute-solvent mass ratio, all colligative properties are inversely
proportional to solute molar mass.
Measurement of colligative properties for a dilute solution of a non-ionized
solute such as urea or glucose in water or another solvent can lead to
determinations of relative molar_masses, both for small molecules and for
polymers which cannot be studied by other means. Alternatively, measurements
for ionized solutes can lead to an estimation of the percentage of dissociation
taking place.
Colligative properties are mostly studied for dilute solutions, whose behavior
may often be approximated as that of an ideal solution.

***** Relative lowering of vapour pressure[edit] *****
The vapour_pressure of a liquid is the pressure of the vapour which is in
equilibrium with that liquid. The vapour pressure of a solvent is lowered when
a non-volatile solute is dissolved in it to form a solution.
For an ideal_solution, the equilibrium vapour pressure is given by Raoult's_law
as
         p =  p   A    &#x22C6;    x   A    +  p   B    &#x22C6;    x   B    +
      &#x22EF;   {\displaystyle p=p_{\rm {A}}^{\star }x_{\rm {A}}+p_{\rm {B}}^
      {\star }x_{\rm {B}}+\cdots }  [p=p_{{{\rm {A}}}}^{{\star }}x_{{{\rm
      {A}}}}+p_{{{\rm {B}}}}^{{\star }}x_{{{\rm {B}}}}+\cdots ], where
    p   i    &#x22C6;     {\displaystyle p_{\rm {i}}^{\star }}  [p_{{{\rm
{i}}}}^{{\star }}] is the vapor pressure of the pure component (i= A, B, ...)
and      x   i      {\displaystyle x_{\rm {i}}}  [x_{{{\rm {i}}}}] is the mole
fraction of the component in the solution
For a solution with a solvent (A) and one non-volatile solute (B),      p   B
&#x22C6;   = 0   {\displaystyle p_{\rm {B}}^{\star }=0}  [p_{{{\rm {B}}}}^{
{\star }}=0] and     p =  p   A    &#x22C6;    x   A      {\displaystyle p=p_
{\rm {A}}^{\star }x_{\rm {A}}}  [p=p_{{{\rm {A}}}}^{{\star }}x_{{{\rm {A}}}}]
The vapour pressure lowering relative to pure solvent is     &#x0394; p =  p
A    &#x22C6;   &#x2212; p =  p   A    &#x22C6;   ( 1 &#x2212;  x   A    ) =  p
A    &#x22C6;    x   B      {\displaystyle \Delta p=p_{\rm {A}}^{\star }-p=p_
{\rm {A}}^{\star }(1-x_{\rm {A}})=p_{\rm {A}}^{\star }x_{\rm {B}}}  [\Delta
p=p_{{{\rm {A}}}}^{{\star }}-p=p_{{{\rm {A}}}}^{{\star }}(1-x_{{{\rm {A}}}})=p_
{{{\rm {A}}}}^{{\star }}x_{{{\rm {B}}}}], which is proportional to the mole
fraction of solute.
If the solute dissociates in solution, then the number of moles of solute is
increased by the van_'t_Hoff_factor     i   {\displaystyle i}  [i], which
represents the true number of solute particles for each formula unit. For
example, the strong_electrolyte MgCl2 dissociates into one Mg2+ ion and two
Clâ ions, so that if ionization is complete, i = 3 and     &#x0394; p =  p
A    &#x22C6;    x   B      {\displaystyle \Delta p=p_{\rm {A}}^{\star }x_{\rm
{B}}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta p=p_{\rm {A}}^{\star }x_{\rm {B}}}].Where      x
B      {\displaystyle x_{\rm {B}}}  [{\displaystyle x_{\rm {B}}}] is calculated
with moles of solute i times initial moles and moles of solvent same as initial
moles of solvent before dissociation. The measured colligative properties show
that i is somewhat less than 3 due to ion_association.
***** Boiling point and freezing point[edit] *****
Addition of solute to form a solution stabilizes the solvent in the liquid
phase, and lowers the solvent chemical_potential so that solvent molecules have
less tendency to move to the gas or solid phases. As a result, liquid solutions
slightly above the solvent boiling point at a given pressure become stable,
which means that the boiling point increases. Similarly, liquid solutions
slightly below the solvent freezing point become stable meaning that the
freezing point decreases. Both the boiling_point_elevation and the freezing
point_depression are proportional to the lowering of vapour pressure in a
dilute solution.
These properties are colligative in systems where the solute is essentially
confined to the liquid phase. Boiling point elevation (like vapour pressure
lowering) is colligative for non-volatile solutes where the solute presence in
the gas phase is negligible. Freezing point depression is colligative for most
solutes since very few solutes dissolve appreciably in solid solvents.
**** Boiling point elevation (ebullioscopy)[edit] ****
Main article: Boiling_point_elevation
The boiling_point of a liquid at a given external pressure is the temperature
(     T   b      {\displaystyle T_{\rm {b}}}  [T_{{{\rm {b}}}}]) at which the
vapor pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure. The normal boiling
point is the boiling point at a pressure equal to 1 atm.
The boiling point of a pure solvent is increased by the addition of a non-
volatile solute, and the elevation can be measured by ebullioscopy. It is found
that
         &#x0394;  T   b    =  T   b    ( s o l u t i o n ) &#x2212;  T   b
      ( s o l v e n t ) = i &#x22C5;  K  b   &#x22C5; m   {\displaystyle \Delta
      T_{\rm {b}}=T_{\rm {b}}(solution)-T_{\rm {b}}(solvent)=i\cdot K_{b}\cdot
      m}  [\Delta T_{{{\rm {b}}}}=T_{{{\rm {b}}}}(solution)-T_{{{\rm {b}}}}
      (solvent)=i\cdot K_{b}\cdot m]
Here i is the van_'t_Hoff_factor as above, Kb is the ebullioscopic_constant of
the solvent (equal to 0.512 Â°C kg/mol for water), and m is the molality of the
solution.
The boiling point is the temperature at which there is equilibrium between
liquid and gas phases. At the boiling point, the number of gas molecules
condensing to liquid equals the number of liquid molecules evaporating to gas.
Adding a solute dilutes the concentration of the liquid molecules and reduces
the rate of evaporation. To compensate for this and re-attain equilibrium, the
boiling point occurs at a higher temperature.
If the solution is assumed to be an ideal_solution, Kb can be evaluated from
the thermodynamic condition for liquid-vapor equilibrium. At the boiling point
the chemical_potential Î¼A of the solvent in the solution phase equals the
chemical potential in the pure vapor phase above the solution.
          &#x03BC;  A   (  T  b   ) =  &#x03BC;  A   &#x22C6;   (  T  b   ) + R
      T ln &#x2061;  x  A   &#xA0; =  &#x03BC;  A   &#x22C6;   ( g , 1 a t m )
      {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(T_{b})=\mu _{A}^{\star }(T_{b})+RT\ln x_{A}\ =\mu
      _{A}^{\star }(g,1atm)}  [\mu _{A}(T_{b})=\mu _{A}^{{\star }}(T_{b})+RT\ln
      x_{A}\ =\mu _{A}^{{\star }}(g,1atm)],
where the asterisks indicate pure phases. This leads to the result      K  b
= R M  T  b   2    /  &#x0394;  H   v a p      {\displaystyle K_{b}=RMT_{b}^
{2}/\Delta H_{\mathrm {vap} }}  [K_{b}=RMT_{b}^{2}/\Delta H_{{{\mathrm
{vap}}}}], where R is the molar_gas_constant, M is the solvent molar_mass and
ÎHvap is the solvent molar enthalpy_of_vaporization.[5]
**** Freezing point depression (cryoscopy)[edit] ****
Main article: Freezing_point_depression
The freezing point (     T   f      {\displaystyle T_{\rm {f}}}  [T_{{{\rm
{f}}}}]) of a pure solvent is lowered by the addition of a solute which is
insoluble in the solid solvent, and the measurement of this difference is
called cryoscopy. It is found that
         &#x0394;  T   f    =  T   f    ( s o l u t i o n ) &#x2212;  T   f
      ( s o l v e n t ) = &#x2212; i &#x22C5;  K  f   &#x22C5; m
      {\displaystyle \Delta T_{\rm {f}}=T_{\rm {f}}(solution)-T_{\rm {f}}
      (solvent)=-i\cdot K_{f}\cdot m}  [\Delta T_{{{\rm {f}}}}=T_{{{\rm {f}}}}
      (solution)-T_{{{\rm {f}}}}(solvent)=-i\cdot K_{f}\cdot m]
Here Kf is the cryoscopic_constant (equal to 1.86 Â°C kg/mol for the freezing
point of water), i is the van 't Hoff factor, and m the molality.
In the liquid solution, the solvent is diluted by the addition of a solute, so
that fewer molecules are available to freeze. Re-establishment of equilibrium
is achieved at a lower temperature at which the rate of freezing becomes equal
to the rate of liquefying. At the lower freezing point, the vapor pressure of
the liquid is equal to the vapor pressure of the corresponding solid, and the
chemical potentials of the two phases are equal as well. The equality of
chemical potentials permits the evaluation of the cryoscopic constant as      K
f   = R M  T  f   2    /  &#x0394;  H   f u s      {\displaystyle K_{f}=RMT_
{f}^{2}/\Delta H_{\mathrm {fus} }}  [K_{f}=RMT_{f}^{2}/\Delta H_{{{\mathrm
{fus}}}}], where ÎHfus is the solvent molar enthalpy_of_fusion.[5]
***** Osmotic pressure[edit] *****
Further information: Osmotic_pressure
The osmotic pressure of a solution is the difference in pressure between the
solution and the pure liquid solvent when the two are in equilibrium across a
semipermeable_membrane, which allows the passage of solvent molecules but not
of solute particles. If the two phases are at the same initial pressure, there
is a net transfer of solvent across the membrane into the solution known as
osmosis. The process stops and equilibrium is attained when the pressure
difference equals the osmotic pressure.
Two laws governing the osmotic pressure of a dilute solution were discovered by
the German botanist W._F._P._Pfeffer and the Dutch chemist J._H._vanât_Hoff:
   1. The osmotic_pressure of a dilute solution at constant temperature is
      directly proportional to its concentration.
   2. The osmotic pressure of a solution is directly proportional to its
      absolute temperature.
These are analogous to Boyle's_law and Charles's_Law for gases. Similarly, the
combined ideal_gas_law,     p V = n R T   {\displaystyle pV=nRT}  [pV=nRT], has
as analog for ideal solutions     &#x03A0; V = n R T i   {\displaystyle \Pi
V=nRTi}  [\Pi V=nRTi], where     &#x03A0;   {\displaystyle \Pi }  [\Pi ] is
osmotic pressure; V is the volume; n is the number of moles of solute; R is the
molar gas_constant 8.314 J Kâ1 molâ1; T is absolute temperature; and i is
the Van_'t_Hoff_factor.
The osmotic pressure is then proportional to the molar_concentration     c = n
/  V   {\displaystyle c=n/V}  [c=n/V], since
         &#x03A0; =    n R T i  V   = c R T i   {\displaystyle \Pi ={\frac
      {nRTi}{V}}=cRTi}  [\Pi ={\frac  {nRTi}{V}}=cRTi]
The osmotic pressure is proportional to the concentration of solute particles
ci and is therefore a colligative property.
As with the other colligative properties, this equation is a consequence of the
equality of solvent chemical potentials of the two phases in equilibrium. In
this case the phases are the pure solvent at pressure P and the solution at
total pressure (P + Ï).[6]
***** History[edit] *****
The word colligative (Latin: co,ligare) was introduced in 1891 by Wilhelm
Ostwald. Ostwald classified solute properties in three categories:[7][8]
   1. colligative properties which depend only on solute concentration and
      temperature, and are independent of the nature of the solute particles
   2. additive properties such as mass, which are the sums of properties of the
      constituent particles and therefore depend also on the composition (or
      molecular formula) of the solute, and
   3. constitutional properties which depend further on the molecular structure
      of the solute.
