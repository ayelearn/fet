****** Molecularity ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Molecularity in chemistry is the number of molecules that come together to
react in an elementary_(single-step)_reaction[1] and is equal to the sum of
stoichiometric_coefficients of reactants in this elementary reaction.[2]
Depending on how many molecules come together, a reaction can be unimolecular,
bimolecular or trimolecular.
The kinetic order of any elementary reaction or reaction step is equal to its
molecularity, and the rate_equation of an elementary reaction can therefore be
determined by inspection, from the molecularity.[1]
The kinetic order of a complex (multistep) reaction, however, cannot be equated
to molecularity since molecularity only describes elementary reactions or
steps.

***** Unimolecular reactions[edit] *****
In a unimolecular reaction, a single molecule rearranges atoms forming
different molecules.[1] This is illustrated by the equation
          A &#x27F6; P    {\displaystyle {\ce {A -> P}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce
      {A -> P}}}],
where P means Product(s). The reaction or reaction step is an isomerization if
there is only one product molecule, or a dissociation if there is more than one
product molecule.
In either case the rate of the reaction or step is described by the first_order
rate_law
            d  [   A   ]    d t    = &#x2212;  k  r    [   A   ]  &#xA0; ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {d\left[{{\ce {A}}}\right]}{dt}}=-k_{r}\left[{{\ce
      {A}}}\right]\ ,}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {d\left[{\ce {A}}\right]}{dt}}=-
      k_{r}\left[{\ce {A}}\right]\ ,}]
where [A] is the concentration of species A, t is time, and kr is the reaction
rate_constant.
As can be deduced from the rate law equation, the number of A molecules that
decay is proportional to the number of A molecules available. An example of a
unimolecular reaction, is the isomerization of cyclopropane to propene:
[Izomerization_of_cyclopropane.jpg]
Unimolecular reactions can be explained by the Lindemann-Hinshelwood mechanism.
***** Bimolecular reactions[edit] *****
In a bimolecular reaction, two molecules collide and exchange energy, atoms or
groups of atoms.[1]
This can be described by the equation
          A + B &#x27F6; P    {\displaystyle {\ce {A + B -> P}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\ce {A + B -> P}}}]
which corresponds to the second order rate law:        d [  A  ]   d t    =
&#x2212;  k  r     [ A ]   [ B ]     {\displaystyle {\frac {d[{\ce {A}}]}
{dt}}=-k_{r}{\ce {[A][B]}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {d[{\ce {A}}]}{dt}}=-k_{r}
{\ce {[A][B]}}}].
Here, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the rate at which the
reactants come together. An example of a bimolecular reaction is the SN2-type
nucleophilic_substitution of methyl_bromide by hydroxide_ion:[3]
           CH  3      Br +  OH  &#x2212;   &#x27F6;  CH  3      OH +  Br
      &#x2212;      {\displaystyle {\ce {CH3Br + OH^- -> CH3OH + Br^-}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\ce {CH3Br + OH^- -> CH3OH + Br^-}}}]
***** Termolecular reactions[edit] *****
A termolecular[4][5] (or trimolecular)[6] reaction in solutions or gas mixtures
involves three reactant molecules simultaneously colliding.[4] However the term
trimolecular is also used to refer to three body association reactions of the
type
          A + B   &#x2192;   M     C    {\displaystyle {\ce {A + B ->[{\ce
      {M}}] C}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {A + B ->[{\ce {M}}] C}}}]
Where the M over the arrow denotes that to conserve energy and momentum a
second reaction with a third body is required. After the initial bimolecular
collision of A and B an energetically excited reaction_intermediate is formed,
then, it collides with a M body, in a second bimolecular reaction, transferring
the excess energy to it.[7]
The reaction can be explained as two consecutive reactions:
           A + B &#x27F6; AB   &#x2217;     {\displaystyle {\ce {A + B -> AB}}^
      {*}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {A + B -> AB}}^{*}}]
           AB   &#x2217;    + M &#x27F6; C + M    {\displaystyle {\ce {AB}}^{*}
      {\ce {+ M -> C + M}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {AB}}^{*}{\ce {+ M -> C +
      M}}}]
These reactions frequently have a pressure and temperature dependence region of
transition between second and third order kinetics.[8]
Catalytic reactions are often three-component, but in practice a complex of the
starting materials is first formed and the rate-determining step is the
reaction of this complex into products, not an adventitious collision between
the two species and the catalyst. For example, in hydrogenation with a metal
catalyst, molecular dihydrogen first dissociates onto the metal surface into
hydrogen atoms bound to the surface, and it is these monatomic hydrogens that
react with the starting material, also previously adsorbed onto the surface.
Reactions of higher molecularity are not observed due to very small probability
of simultaneous interaction between 4 or more molecules[9][4]
***** Difference between molecularity and order of reaction[edit] *****
It is important to distinguish molecularity from order_of_reaction. The order
of reaction is an empirical quantity determined by experiment from the rate law
of the reaction. It is the sum of the exponents in the rate law equation.[10]
Molecularity, on the other hand, is deduced from the mechanism of an elementary
reaction, and is used only in context of an elementary reaction. It is the
number of molecules taking part in this reaction.
This difference can be illustrated on the reaction between nitric_oxide and
hydrogen:
          2  NO + 2   H  2      &#x27F6;  N  2      + 2   H  2      O
      {\displaystyle {\ce {2NO + 2H2 -> N2 + 2H2O}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {2NO
      + 2H2 -> N2 + 2H2O}}}].[11]
The observed rate law is     v = k    [ NO ]   2    [  H  2      ]
{\displaystyle v=k{\ce {[NO]^2[H2]}}}  [{\displaystyle v=k{\ce {[NO]^2[H2]}}}],
so that the reaction is third order. Since the order does not equal the sum of
reactant stoechiometric coefficients, the reaction must involve more than one
step. The proposed two-step mechanism[11] has a rate-limiting first step whose
molecularity corresponds to the overall order of 3:
          2  NO +  H  2      &#x27F6;  N  2      +  H  2       O  2
      {\displaystyle {\ce {2 NO + H2 -> N2 + H2O2}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {2
      NO + H2 -> N2 + H2O2}}}]ãã(slow)
           H  2       O  2      +  H  2      &#x27F6; 2   H  2      O
      {\displaystyle {\ce {H2O2 + H2 -> 2H2O}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {H2O2 +
      H2 -> 2H2O}}}]ãã(fast)
On the other hand, the molecularity of this reaction is undefined, because it
involves a mechanism of more than one step. However, we can consider the
molecularity of the individual elementary reactions that make up this
mechanism: the first step is termolecular because it involves three reactant
molecules, while the second step is bimolecular because it involves two
reactant molecules.
