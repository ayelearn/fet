The sparks created by striking steel against a piece of flint provide the
activation energy to initiate combustion in this Bunsen_burner. The blue flame
sustains itself after the sparks stop because the continued combustion of the
flame is now energetically favorable.
In chemistry and physics, activation energy is the energy which must be
provided to a chemical or nuclear[1] system with potential reactants to result
in: a chemical_reaction,[2] nuclear_reaction, [3]or various other physical
phenomena.[4][5]
The activation energy (Ea) of a reaction is measured in joules (J) and or
kilojoules_per_mole (kJ/mol) or kilocalories_per_mole (kcal/mol).[6]
Activation energy can be thought of as the magnitude of the potential_barrier
(sometimes called the energy barrier) separating minima of the potential_energy
surface pertaining to the initial and final thermodynamic_state. For a chemical
reaction, or division[7] to proceed at a reasonable rate, the temperature of
the system should be high enough such that there exists an appreciable number
of molecules with translational energy equal to or greater than the activation
energy.
The term Activation Energy was introduced in 1889 by the Swedish scientist
Svante_Arrhenius.[8]

***** Temperature dependence and the relation to the Arrhenius equation[edit]
*****
Main article: Arrhenius_equation
The Arrhenius_equation gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between
the activation energy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds. From the
equation, the activation energy can be found through the relation
         k = A  e   &#x2212;  E   a      /   ( R T )      {\displaystyle k=Ae^{
      {-E_{\textrm {a}}}/{(RT)}}}  [{\displaystyle k=Ae^{{-E_{\textrm {a}}}/{
      (RT)}}}]
where A is the pre-exponential_factor for the reaction, R is the universal gas
constant, T is the absolute temperature (usually in kelvins), and k is the
reaction_rate_coefficient. Even without knowing A, Ea can be evaluated from the
variation in reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature (within
the validity of the Arrhenius equation).
At a more advanced level, the net Arrhenius activation energy term from the
Arrhenius equation is best regarded as an experimentally determined parameter
that indicates the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature. There are
two objections to associating this activation energy with the threshold barrier
for an elementary reaction. First, it is often unclear as to whether or not
reaction does proceed in one step; threshold barriers that are averaged out
over all elementary steps have little theoretical value. Second, even if the
reaction being studied is elementary, a spectrum of individual collisions
contributes to rate constants obtained from bulk ('bulb') experiments involving
billions of molecules, with many different reactant collision geometries and
angles, different translational and (possibly) vibrational energiesâall of
which may lead to different microscopic reaction rates.[citation_needed]
***** Negative activation energy[edit] *****
In some cases, rates of reaction decrease with increasing temperature. When
following an approximately exponential relationship so the rate constant can
still be fit to an Arrhenius expression, this results in a negative value of
Ea. Elementary reactions exhibiting these negative activation energies are
typically barrierless reactions, in which the reaction proceeding relies on the
capture of the molecules in a potential well. Increasing the temperature leads
to a reduced probability of the colliding molecules capturing one another (with
more glancing collisions not leading to reaction as the higher momentum carries
the colliding particles out of the potential well), expressed as a reaction
cross_section that decreases with increasing temperature. Such a situation no
longer leads itself to direct interpretations as the height of a potential
barrier.
***** Catalysts[edit] *****
Main article: Catalysis
The relationship between activation energy (     E   a      {\displaystyle E_
{\textrm {a}}}  [{\displaystyle E_{\textrm {a}}}]) and enthalpy_of_formation
(ÎH) with and without a catalyst, plotted against the reaction_coordinate. The
highest energy position (peak position) represents the transition state. With
the catalyst, the energy required to enter transition state decreases, thereby
decreasing the energy required to initiate the reaction.
A substance that modifies the transition state to lower the activation energy
is termed a catalyst; a catalyst composed only of protein and (if applicable)
small molecule cofactors is termed an enzyme. A catalyst increases the rate of
reaction without being consumed in the reaction.[9] In addition, the catalyst
lowers the activation energy, but it does not change the energies of the
original reactants or products, and so does not change equilibrium.[10] Rather,
the reactant energy and the product energy remain the same and only the
activation energy is altered (lowered).
***** Relationship with Gibbs energy of activation[edit] *****
Main article: Transition_state_theory
In the Arrhenius_equation, the term activation energy (Ea) is used to describe
the energy required to_reach_the transition_state, and the exponential
relationship k = A exp(Ea/RT) holds. In transition state theory, a more
sophisticated model of the relationship between reaction rates and the
transition state, a superficially similar mathematical relationship, the Eyring
equation, is used to describe the rate of a reaction: k = (kBT / h) exp
(âÎGâ¡ / RT). However, instead of modeling the temperature dependence of
reaction rate phenomenologically, the Eyring equation models individual
elementary step of a reaction. Thus, for a multistep process, there is no
straightforward relationship between the two models. Nevertheless, the
functional forms of the Arrhenius and Eyring equations are similar, and for a
one-step process, simple and chemically meaningful correspondences can be drawn
between Arrhenius and Eyring parameters.
Instead of also using Ea, the Eyring equation uses the concept of Gibbs_energy
and the symbol ÎGâ¡ to denote the Gibbs energy of activation for the
transition_state. In the equation, kB and h are the Boltzmann and Planck
constants, respectively. Although the equations look similar, it is important
to note that the Gibbs energy contains an entropic term in addition to the
enthalpic one. In the Arrhenius equation, this entropic term is accounted for
by the pre-exponential factor A. More specifically, we can write the Gibbs free
energy of activation in terms of enthalpy and entropy_of_activation: ÎGâ¡ =
ÎHâ¡ â T ÎSâ¡. Then, for a unimolecular, one-step reaction, the
approximate relationships Ea = ÎHâ¡ + RT and A = (kBT/h) exp(1 + ÎSâ¡/R)
hold. Note, however, that in Arrhenius theory proper, A is temperature
independent, while here, there is a linear dependence on T. For a one-step
unimolecular process whose half-life at room temperature is about 2 hours,
ÎGâ¡ is approximately 23 kcal/mol. This is also the roughly the magnitude of
Ea for a reaction that proceeds over several hours at room temperature. Due to
the relatively small magnitude of TÎSâ¡ and RT at ordinary temperatures for
most reactions, in sloppy discourse, Ea, ÎGâ¡, and ÎHâ¡ are often conflated
and all referred to as the "activation energy".
