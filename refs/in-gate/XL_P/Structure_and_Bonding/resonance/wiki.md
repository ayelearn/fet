Increase of amplitude as damping decreases and frequency approaches resonant
frequency of a driven damped simple_harmonic_oscillator.[1][2]
In mechanical_systems, resonance is a phenomenon that only occurs when the
frequency at which a force is periodically applied is equal or nearly equal to
one of the natural_frequencies of the system on which it acts. This causes the
system to oscillate with larger amplitude than when the force is applied at
other frequencies.[3]
Frequencies at which the response amplitude is a relative_maximum are also
known as resonant frequencies or resonance frequencies of the system.[3] Near
resonant frequencies, small periodic forces have the ability to produce large
amplitude oscillations, due to the storage of vibrational_energy.
In other systems, such as electrical or optical, phenomena occur which are
described as resonance but depend on the interaction between different aspects
of the system, not on an external driver.
For example, electrical_resonance occurs in a circuit with capacitors and
inductors because the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor generates an
electric current in its windings that charges the capacitor, and then the
discharging capacitor provides an electric current that builds the magnetic
field in the inductor. Once the circuit is charged, the oscillation is self-
sustaining, and there is no external periodic driving action. This is analogous
to a mechanical pendulum, where mechanical_energy is converted back and forth
between kinetic and potential, and both systems are forms of simple_harmonic
oscillators.
In optical_cavities, light confined in the cavity reflects back and forth
multiple times. This produces standing_waves, and only certain patterns and
frequencies of radiation are sustained, due to the effects of interference,
while the others are suppressed by destructive interference. Once the light
enters the cavity, the oscillation is self-sustaining, and there is no external
periodic driving action.
Some behavior is mistaken for resonance but instead is a form of self-
oscillation, such as aeroelastic_flutter, speed_wobble, or Hunting_oscillation.
In these cases, the external energy source does not oscillate, but the
components of the system interact with each other in a periodic fashion.[4]

***** Overview[edit] *****
Resonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy
between two or more different storage_modes (such as kinetic energy and
potential energy in the case of a simple pendulum). However, there are some
losses from cycle to cycle, called damping. When damping is small, the resonant
frequency is approximately equal to the natural_frequency of the system, which
is a frequency of unforced vibrations. Some systems have multiple, distinct,
resonant frequencies.
Resonance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or waves: there is
mechanical_resonance, acoustic_resonance, electromagnetic resonance, nuclear
magnetic_resonance (NMR), electron_spin_resonance (ESR) and resonance of
quantum wave_functions. Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of
a specific frequency (e.g., musical_instruments), or pick out specific
frequencies from a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g.,
filters).
The term resonance (from Latin resonantia, 'echo', from resonare, 'resound')
originates from the field of acoustics, particularly observed in musical
instruments, e.g., when strings started to vibrate and to produce sound without
direct excitation by the player.
***** Examples[edit] *****
Pushing a person in a swing is a common example of resonance. The loaded swing,
a pendulum, has a natural_frequency of oscillation, its resonant frequency, and
resists being pushed at a faster or slower rate.
A familiar example is a playground swing, which acts as a pendulum. Pushing a
person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant
frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while
attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs.
This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match
the swing's natural oscillations.
Resonance occurs widely in nature, and is exploited in many manmade devices. It
is the mechanism by which virtually all sinusoidal waves and vibrations are
generated. Many sounds we hear, such as when hard objects of metal, glass, or
wood are struck, are caused by brief resonant vibrations in the object. Light
and other short wavelength electromagnetic_radiation is produced by resonance
on an atomic_scale, such as electrons in atoms. Other examples of resonance:
    * Timekeeping mechanisms of modern clocks and watches, e.g., the balance
      wheel in a mechanical watch and the quartz_crystal in a quartz_watch
    * Tidal_resonance of the Bay_of_Fundy
    * Acoustic_resonances of musical_instruments and the human vocal_tract
    * Shattering of a crystal wineglass when exposed to a musical tone of the
      right pitch (its resonant frequency)
    * Friction_idiophones, such as making a glass object (glass, bottle, vase)
      vibrate by rubbing around its rim with a fingertip
    * Electrical_resonance of tuned_circuits in radios and TVs that allow radio
      frequencies to be selectively received
    * Creation of coherent light by optical_resonance in a laser cavity

      giants

**** Tacoma Narrows Bridge[edit] ****
Main article: Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)
The dramatically visible, rhythmic twisting that resulted in the 1940 collapse
of "Galloping Gertie", the original Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge, is mistakenly
characterized as an example of resonance phenomenon in certain textbooks.[3]
The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple
mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated interaction between the bridge
and the winds passing through itâa phenomenon known as aeroelastic_flutter,
which is a kind of "self-sustaining vibration" as referred to in the nonlinear
theory of vibrations. Robert_H._Scanlan, father of bridge aerodynamics, has
written an article about this misunderstanding.[4]
**** International Space Station[edit] ****
The rocket_engines for the International_Space_Station (ISS) are controlled by
an autopilot. Ordinarily, uploaded parameters for controlling the engine
control system for the Zvezda module make the rocket engines boost the
International Space Station to a higher orbit. The rocket engines are hinge-
mounted, and ordinarily the crew doesn't notice the operation. On January 14,
2009, however, the uploaded parameters made the autopilot swing the rocket
engines in larger and larger oscillations, at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. These
oscillations were captured on video, and lasted for 142 seconds.[5]
***** Types of resonance[edit] *****
**** Mechanical and acoustic resonance[edit] ****
Main articles: Mechanical_resonance, Acoustic_resonance, and String_resonance
School resonating mass experiment
Mechanical_resonance is the tendency of a mechanical_system to absorb more
energy when the frequency of its oscillations matches the system's natural
frequency of vibration than it does at other frequencies. It may cause violent
swaying motions and even catastrophic failure in improperly constructed
structures including bridges, buildings, trains, and aircraft. When designing
objects, engineers must ensure the mechanical resonance frequencies of the
component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of motors or other
oscillating parts, a phenomenon known as resonance_disaster.
Avoiding resonance disasters is a major concern in every building, tower, and
bridge construction project. As a countermeasure, shock_mounts can be installed
to absorb resonant frequencies and thus dissipate the absorbed energy. The
Taipei_101 building relies on a 660-tonne pendulum (730-short-ton)âa tuned
mass_damperâto cancel resonance. Furthermore, the structure is designed to
resonate at a frequency that does not typically occur. Buildings in seismic
zones are often constructed to take into account the oscillating frequencies of
expected ground motion. In addition, engineers designing objects having engines
must ensure that the mechanical resonant frequencies of the component parts do
not match driving vibrational frequencies of the motors or other strongly
oscillating parts.
Clocks keep time by mechanical resonance in a balance_wheel, pendulum, or
quartz_crystal.
The cadence of runners has been hypothesized to be energetically favorable due
to resonance between the elastic energy stored in the lower limb and the mass
of the runner.[6]
Acoustic_resonance is a branch of mechanical_resonance that is concerned with
the mechanical vibrations across the frequency range of human hearing, in other
words sound. For humans, hearing is normally limited to frequencies between
about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz),[7] Many objects and materials act as
resonators with resonant frequencies within this range, and when struck vibrate
mechanically, pushing on the surrounding air to create sound waves. This is the
source of many percussive sounds we hear.
Acoustic resonance is an important consideration for instrument builders, as
most acoustic instruments use resonators, such as the strings and body of a
violin, the length of tube in a flute, and the shape of, and tension on, a drum
membrane.
Like mechanical resonance, acoustic resonance can result in catastrophic
failure of the object at resonance. The classic example of this is breaking a
wine glass with sound at the precise resonant frequency of the glass, although
this is difficult in practice.[8]
**** Electrical resonance[edit] ****
Main article: Electrical_resonance
Animation illustrating electrical resonance in a tuned_circuit, consisting of a
capacitor (C) and an inductor (L) connected together. Charge flows back and
forth between the capacitor plates through the inductor. Energy oscillates back
and forth between the capacitor's electric_field (E) and the inductor's
magnetic_field (B).
Electrical_resonance occurs in an electric_circuit at a particular resonant
frequency when the impedance of the circuit is at a minimum in a series circuit
or at maximum in a parallel circuit (usually when the transfer_function peaks
in absolute value). Resonance in circuits are used for both transmitting and
receiving wireless communications such as television, cell phones and radio.[9]
**** Optical resonance[edit] ****
Main article: Optical_cavity
An optical_cavity, also called an optical resonator, is an arrangement of
mirrors that forms a standing_wave cavity_resonator for light_waves. Optical
cavities are a major component of lasers, surrounding the gain_medium and
providing feedback of the laser light. They are also used in optical_parametric
oscillators and some interferometers. Light confined in the cavity reflects
multiple times producing standing waves for certain resonant frequencies. The
standing wave patterns produced are called "modes". Longitudinal_modes differ
only in frequency while transverse_modes differ for different frequencies and
have different intensity patterns across the cross-section of the beam. Ring
resonators and whispering_galleries are examples of optical resonators that do
not form standing waves.
Different resonator types are distinguished by the focal lengths of the two
mirrors and the distance between them; flat mirrors are not often used because
of the difficulty of aligning them precisely. The geometry (resonator type)
must be chosen so the beam remains stable, i.e., the beam size does not
continue to grow with each reflection. Resonator types are also designed to
meet other criteria such as minimum beam waist or having no focal point (and
therefore intense light at that point) inside the cavity.
Optical cavities are designed to have a very large Q_factor.[10] A beam
reflects a large number of times with little attenuationâtherefore the
frequency line_width of the beam is small compared to the frequency of the
laser.
Additional optical resonances are guided-mode_resonances and surface_plasmon
resonance, which result in anomalous reflection and high evanescent fields at
resonance. In this case, the resonant modes are guided modes of a waveguide or
surface plasmon modes of a dielectric-metallic interface. These modes are
usually excited by a subwavelength grating.
**** Orbital resonance[edit] ****
Main article: Orbital_resonance
In celestial_mechanics, an orbital_resonance occurs when two orbiting bodies
exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually due to
their orbital_periods being related by a ratio of two small integers. Orbital
resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies. In
most cases, this results in an unstable interaction, in which the bodies
exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under
some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so
that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of
Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa, and Io, and the 2:3 resonance between Pluto
and Neptune. Unstable resonances with Saturn's inner moons give rise to gaps in
the rings_of_Saturn. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with
similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to clear_the
neighborhood around their orbits by ejecting nearly everything else around
them; this effect is used in the current definition_of_a_planet.
**** Atomic, particle, and molecular resonance[edit] ****
Main articles: Nuclear_magnetic_resonance and Resonance_(particle_physics)
NMR Magnet at HWB-NMR, Birmingham, UK. In its strong 21.2-tesla field, the
proton resonance is at 900 MHz.
Nuclear_magnetic_resonance (NMR) is the name given to a physical resonance
phenomenon involving the observation of specific quantum_mechanical magnetic
properties of an atomic nucleus in the presence of an applied, external
magnetic field. Many scientific techniques exploit NMR phenomena to study
molecular_physics, crystals, and non-crystalline materials through NMR
spectroscopy. NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging
techniques, such as in magnetic_resonance_imaging (MRI).
All nuclei containing odd numbers of nucleons have an intrinsic magnetic_moment
and angular_momentum. A key feature of NMR is that the resonant frequency of a
particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied
magnetic field. It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if
a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonant
frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are
located. Therefore, the particle can be located quite precisely by its resonant
frequency.
Electron_paramagnetic_resonance, otherwise known as electron spin resonance
(ESR), is a spectroscopic technique similar to NMR, but uses unpaired electrons
instead. Materials for which this can be applied are much more limited since
the material needs to both have an unpaired spin and be paramagnetic.
The MÃ¶ssbauer_effect is the resonant and recoil-free emission and absorption
of gamma_ray photons by atoms bound in a solid form.
Resonance_in_particle_physics appears in similar circumstances to classical
physics at the level of quantum_mechanics and quantum_field_theory. However,
they can also be thought of as unstable particles, with the formula above valid
if Î is the decay_rate and Î© replaced by the particle's mass M. In that case,
the formula comes from the particle's propagator, with its mass replaced by the
complex_number M + iÎ. The formula is further related to the particle's decay
rate by the optical_theorem.
***** Theory[edit] *****
"Universal Resonance Curve", a symmetric approximation to the normalized
response of a resonant circuit; abscissa values are deviation from center
frequency, in units of center frequency divided by 2Q; ordinate is relative
amplitude, and phase in cycles; dashed curves compare the range of responses of
real two-pole circuits for a Q value of 5; for higher Q values, there is less
deviation from the universal curve. Crosses mark the edges of the 3 dB
bandwidth (gain 0.707, phase shift 45Â° or 0.125 cycle).
The exact response of a resonance, especially for frequencies far from the
resonant frequency, depends on the details of the physical system, and is
usually not exactly symmetric about the resonant frequency, as illustrated for
the simple_harmonic_oscillator above. For a lightly damped linear oscillator
with a resonance frequency Î©, the intensity of oscillations I when the system
is driven with a driving frequency Ï is typically approximated by a formula
that is symmetric about the resonance frequency:[11]
         I ( &#x03C9; ) &#x2261;  |  &#x03C7;   |   2   &#x221D;   1
      ( &#x03C9; &#x2212; &#x03A9;  )  2   +   (   &#x0393; 2   )   2      .
      {\displaystyle I(\omega )\equiv |\chi |^{2}\propto {\frac {1}{(\omega -
      \Omega )^{2}+\left({\frac {\Gamma }{2}}\right)^{2}}}.}  [{\displaystyle I
      (\omega )\equiv |\chi |^{2}\propto {\frac {1}{(\omega -\Omega )^{2}+\left
      ({\frac {\Gamma }{2}}\right)^{2}}}.}]
Where the susceptibility     &#x03C7; ( &#x03C9; )   {\displaystyle \chi
(\omega )}  [{\displaystyle \chi (\omega )}] links the amplitude of the
oscillator to the driving force in frequency space:[12]
   x ( &#x03C9; ) = &#x03C7; ( &#x03C9; ) F ( &#x03C9; )   {\displaystyle x
(\omega )=\chi (\omega )F(\omega )}  [{\displaystyle x(\omega )=\chi (\omega )F
(\omega )}]
The intensity is defined as the square of the amplitude of the oscillations.
This is a Lorentzian_function, or Cauchy_distribution, and this response is
found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. Î is a parameter
dependent on the damping of the oscillator, and is known as the linewidth of
the resonance. Heavily damped oscillators tend to have broad linewidths, and
respond to a wider range of driving frequencies around the resonant frequency.
The linewidth is inversely_proportional to the Q_factor, which is a measure of
the sharpness of the resonance.
In radio_engineering and electronics_engineering, this approximate symmetric
response is known as the universal resonance curve, a concept introduced by
Frederick_E._Terman in 1932 to simplify the approximate analysis of radio
circuits with a range of center frequencies and Q values.[13][14]
***** Resonators[edit] *****
A physical system can have as many resonant frequencies as it has degrees_of
freedom; each degree of freedom can vibrate as a harmonic_oscillator. Systems
with one degree of freedom, such as a mass on a spring, pendulums, balance
wheels, and LC_tuned_circuits have one resonant frequency. Systems with two
degrees of freedom, such as coupled_pendulums and resonant_transformers can
have two resonant frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators
grows, the time it takes to transfer energy from one to the next becomes
significant. The vibrations in them begin to travel through the coupled
harmonic oscillators in waves, from one oscillator to the next.
Extended objects that can experience resonance due to vibrations inside them
are called resonators, such as organ_pipes, vibrating_strings, quartz_crystals,
microwave and laser cavities. Since these can be viewed as being made of many
coupled moving parts (such as atoms), they can have correspondingly many
resonant frequencies. The vibrations inside them travel as waves, at an
approximately constant velocity, bouncing back and forth between the sides of
the resonator. If the distance between the sides is d, the length of a
roundtrip is 2d. To cause resonance, the phase of a sinusoidal wave after a
roundtrip must be equal to the initial phase, so the waves reinforce the
oscillation. So the condition for resonance in a resonator is that the
roundtrip distance, 2d, be equal to an integer number of wavelengths Î» of the
wave:
         2 d = N &#x03BB; ,   N &#x2208; { 1 , 2 , 3 , &#x2026; }
      {\displaystyle 2d=N\lambda ,\qquad \qquad N\in \{1,2,3,\dots \}}  [2d =
      N\lambda,\qquad\qquad N \in \{1,2,3,\dots\}]
If the velocity of a wave is v, the frequency is f = v/Î» so the resonant
frequencies are:
         f =    N v   2 d      N &#x2208; { 1 , 2 , 3 , &#x2026; }
      {\displaystyle f={\frac {Nv}{2d}}\qquad \qquad N\in \{1,2,3,\dots \}}  [f
      = \frac{Nv}{2d}\qquad\qquad N \in \{1,2,3,\dots\}]
So the resonant frequencies of resonators, called normal_modes, are equally
spaced multiples of a lowest frequency called the fundamental_frequency. The
multiples are often called overtones. There may be several such series of
resonant frequencies, corresponding to different modes of oscillation.
***** Q factor[edit] *****
Main article: Q_factor
The Q_factor or quality factor is a dimensionless parameter that describes how
under-damped an oscillator or resonator is,[15] or equivalently, characterizes
a resonator's bandwidth relative to its center frequency.[16] Higher Q
indicates a lower rate of energy loss relative to the stored energy of the
oscillator, i.e., the oscillations die out more slowly. A pendulum suspended
from a high-quality bearing, oscillating in air, has a high Q, while a pendulum
immersed in oil has a low Q. To sustain a system in resonance in constant
amplitude by providing power externally, the energy provided in each cycle must
be less than the energy stored in the system (i.e., the sum of the potential
and kinetic) by a factor of Q/2Ï. Oscillators with high-quality factors have
low damping, which tends to make them ring longer.
Sinusoidally driven resonators having higher Q factors resonate with greater
amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) but have a smaller range of frequencies
around the frequency at which they resonate. The range of frequencies at which
the oscillator resonates is called the bandwidth. Thus, a high-Q tuned_circuit
in a radio receiver would be more difficult to tune, but would have greater
selectivity, it would do a better job of filtering out signals from other
stations that lie nearby on the spectrum. High Q oscillators operate over a
smaller range of frequencies and are more stable. (See oscillator_phase_noise.)
The quality factor of oscillators varies substantially from system to system.
Systems for which damping is important (such as dampers keeping a door from
slamming shut) have Q = 1/2. Clocks, lasers, and other systems that need either
strong resonance or high frequency stability need high-quality factors. Tuning
forks have quality factors around Q = 1000. The quality factor of atomic_clocks
and some high-Q lasers can reach as high as 1011[17] and higher.[18]
There are many alternate quantities used by physicists and engineers to
describe how damped an oscillator is that are closely related to its quality
factor. Important examples include: the damping_ratio, relative_bandwidth,
linewidth, and bandwidth measured in octaves.
