The neutron is a subatomic_particle, symbol
n
 or
n0
, with no net electric_charge and a mass slightly greater than that of a
proton. Protons and neutrons constitute the nuclei of atoms. Since protons and
neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus, and each has a mass of
approximately one atomic_mass_unit, they are both referred to as nucleons.[5]
Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear_physics.
The chemical and nuclear properties of the nucleus are determined by the number
of protons, called the atomic_number, and the number of neutrons, called the
neutron_number. The atomic_mass_number is the total number of nucleons. For
example, carbon has atomic number 6, and its abundant carbon-12 isotope has 6
neutrons, whereas its rare carbon-13 isotope has 7 neutrons. Some elements
occur in nature with only one stable_isotope, such as fluorine. Other elements
occur with many stable isotopes, such as tin with ten stable isotopes.
Within the nucleus, protons and neutrons are bound together through the nuclear
force. Neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei, with the exception of
the single-proton hydrogen atom. Neutrons are produced copiously in nuclear
fission and fusion. They are a primary contributor to the nucleosynthesis of
chemical elements within stars through fission, fusion, and neutron_capture
processes.
The neutron is essential to the production of nuclear power. In the decade
after the neutron was discovered by James_Chadwick in 1932,[6] neutrons were
used to induce many different types of nuclear_transmutations. With the
discovery of nuclear_fission in 1938,[7] it was quickly realized that, if a
fission event produced neutrons, each of these neutrons might cause further
fission events, in a cascade known as a nuclear_chain_reaction.[8] These events
and findings led to the first self-sustaining nuclear_reactor (Chicago_Pile-1,
1942) and the first nuclear_weapon (Trinity, 1945).
Free neutrons, while not directly ionizing atoms, cause ionizing_radiation. As
such they can be a biological hazard, depending upon dose.[8] A small natural
"neutron background" flux of free neutrons exists on Earth, caused by cosmic
ray showers, and by the natural radioactivity of spontaneously fissionable
elements in the Earth's_crust.[9] Dedicated neutron_sources like neutron
generators, research_reactors and spallation_sources produce free neutrons for
use in irradiation and in neutron_scattering experiments.

An atomic_nucleus is formed by a number of protons, Z (the atomic_number), and
a number of neutrons, N (the neutron_number), bound together by the nuclear
force. The atomic number defines the chemical_properties of the atom, and the
neutron number determines the isotope or nuclide.[8] The terms isotope and
nuclide are often used synonymously, but they refer to chemical and nuclear
properties, respectively. Strictly speaking, isotopes are two or more nuclides
with the same number of protons; nuclides with the same number of neutrons are
called isotones. The atomic_mass_number, symbol A, equals Z+N. Nuclides with
the same atomic mass number are called isobars. The nucleus of the most common
isotope of the hydrogen_atom (with the chemical_symbol 1H) is a lone proton.
The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium (D or 2H) and tritium (T or
3H) contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All other
types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers
of neutrons. The most common nuclide of the common chemical element lead,
208Pb, has 82 protons and 126 neutrons, for example. The table_of_nuclides
comprises all the known nuclides. Even though it is not a chemical element, the
neutron is included in this table.[10]
The free neutron has a mass of 939,565,413.3 eV/c2, or 1.674927471ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’27Â kg,
or 1.00866491588Â u.[3] The neutron has a mean square radius of about
0.8ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’15Â m, or 0.8Â fm,[11] and it is a spin-Ã‚Â½ fermion.[12] The neutron has
no measurable electric charge. With its positive electric charge, the proton is
directly influenced by electric_fields, whereas the neutron is unaffected by
electric fields. The neutron has a magnetic_moment, however, so the neutron is
influenced by magnetic_fields. The neutron's magnetic moment has a negative
value, because its orientation is opposite to the neutron's spin.[13]
A free neutron is unstable, decaying to a proton, electron and antineutrino
with a mean_lifetime of just under 15 minutes (881.5Ã‚Â±1.5Â s).[14] This
radioactive_decay, known as beta_decay, is possible because the mass of the
neutron is slightly greater than the proton. The free proton is stable.
Neutrons or protons bound in a nucleus can be stable or unstable, however,
depending on the nuclide. Beta decay, in which neutrons decay to protons, or
vice versa, is governed by the weak_force, and it requires the emission or
absorption of electrons and neutrinos, or their antiparticles.
Nuclear fission caused by absorption of a neutron by uranium-235. The heavy
nuclide fragments into lighter components and additional neutrons.
Protons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the
nuclear force within the nucleus. The concept of isospin, in which the proton
and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle, is used to
model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces. Because of
the strength of the nuclear force at short distances, the binding_energy of
nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic
energy binding electrons in atoms. Nuclear_reactions (such as nuclear_fission)
therefore have an energy_density that is more than ten million times that of
chemical_reactions. Because of the massÃ¢Â€Â“energy_equivalence, nuclear binding
energies reduce the mass of nuclei. Ultimately, the ability of the nuclear
force to store energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear
components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or
bombs possible. In nuclear fission, the absorption of a neutron by a heavy
nuclide (e.g., uranium-235) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break
into light nuclides and additional neutrons. The positively charged light
nuclides then repel, releasing electromagnetic potential_energy.
The neutron is classified as a hadron, because it is a composite_particle made
of quarks. The neutron is also classified as a baryon, because it is composed
of three valence_quarks.[15] The finite size of the neutron and its magnetic
moment both indicate that the neutron is a composite particle, as opposed to
being an elementary_particle. A neutron contains two down_quarks with charge
Ã¢ÂˆÂ’&#x200b;1â„3 e and one up_quark with charge +&#x200b;2â„3 e.
Like protons, the quarks of the neutron are held together by the strong_force,
mediated by gluons.[16] The nuclear force results from secondary_effects_of_the
more_fundamental_strong_force.
***** Discovery[edit] *****
Main article: Discovery_of_the_neutron
The story of the discovery of the neutron and its properties is central to the
extraordinary developments in atomic physics that occurred in the first half of
the 20th century, leading ultimately to the atomic bomb in 1945. In the 1911
Rutherford model, the atom consisted of a small positively charged massive
nucleus surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons. In
1920, Rutherford suggested that the nucleus consisted of positive protons and
neutrally-charged particles, suggested to be a proton and an electron bound in
some way.[17] Electrons were assumed to reside within the nucleus because it
was known that beta_radiation consisted of electrons emitted from the nucleus.
[17] Rutherford called these uncharged particles neutrons, by the Latin root
for neutralis (neuter) and the Greek suffix -on (a suffix used in the names of
subatomic particles, i.e. electron and proton).[18][19] References to the word
neutron in connection with the atom can be found in the literature as early as
1899, however.[20]
Throughout the 1920s, physicists assumed that the atomic nucleus was composed
of protons and "nuclear electrons"[21][22] but there were obvious problems. It
was difficult to reconcile the protonÃ¢Â€Â“electron model for nuclei with the
Heisenberg_uncertainty_relation of quantum mechanics.[23][24] The Klein
paradox,[25] discovered by Oskar_Klein in 1928, presented further quantum
mechanical objections to the notion of an electron confined within a nucleus.
[23] Observed properties of atoms and molecules were inconsistent with the
nuclear spin expected from the protonÃ¢Â€Â“electron hypothesis. Both protons and
electrons carry an intrinsic spin of Ã‚Â½Â Ã„Â§. Isotopes of the same species (i.e.
having the same number of protons) can have both integer or fractional spin,
i.e. the neutron spin must be also fractional (Ã‚Â½Â Ã„Â§). However, there is no way
to arrange the spins of an electron and a proton (supposed to bond to form a
neutron) to get the fractional spin of a neutron.
In 1931, Walther_Bothe and Herbert_Becker found that if alpha_particle
radiation from polonium fell on beryllium, boron, or lithium, an unusually
penetrating radiation was produced. The radiation was not influenced by an
electric field, so Bothe and Becker assumed it was gamma_radiation.[26][27] The
following year IrÃƒÂ¨ne_Joliot-Curie and FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric_Joliot-Curie in Paris showed
that if this "gamma" radiation fell on paraffin, or any other hydrogen-
containing compound, it ejected protons of very high energy.[28] Neither
Rutherford nor James_Chadwick at the Cavendish_Laboratory in Cambridge were
convinced by the gamma ray interpretation.[29] Chadwick quickly performed a
series of experiments that showed that the new radiation consisted of uncharged
particles with about the same mass as the proton.[6][30][31] These particles
were neutrons. Chadwick won the 1935 Nobel_Prize_in_Physics for this discovery.
[2]
Models depicting the nucleus and electron energy levels in hydrogen, helium,
lithium, and neon atoms. In reality, the diameter of the nucleus is about
100,000 times smaller than the diameter of the atom.
Models for atomic nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons were quickly
developed by Werner_Heisenberg[32][33][34] and others.[35][36] The
protonÃ¢Â€Â“neutron model explained the puzzle of nuclear spins. The origins of
beta radiation were explained by Enrico_Fermi in 1934 by the process_of_beta
decay, in which the neutron decays to a proton by creating an electron and a
(as yet undiscovered) neutrino.[37] In 1935 Chadwick and his doctoral student
Maurice_Goldhaber, reported the first accurate measurement of the mass of the
neutron.[38][39]
By 1934, Fermi had bombarded heavier elements with neutrons to induce
radioactivity in elements of high atomic number. In 1938, Fermi received the
Nobel Prize in Physics "for his demonstrations of the existence of new
radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related
discovery of nuclear_reactions brought about by slow neutrons".[40] In 1938
Otto_Hahn, Lise_Meitner, and Fritz_Strassmann discovered nuclear_fission, or
the fractionation of uranium nuclei into light elements, induced by neutron
bombardment.[41][42][43] In 1945 Hahn received the 1944 Nobel_Prize_in
Chemistry "for his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei."[44][45]
[46] The discovery of nuclear fission would lead to the development of nuclear
power and the atomic bomb by the end of World War II.
***** Beta decay and the stability of the nucleus[edit] *****
The Feynman_diagram for beta decay of a neutron into a proton, electron, and
electron_antineutrino via an intermediate heavy W_boson
Under the Standard_Model of particle physics, the only possible decay mode for
the neutron that conserves baryon_number is for one of the neutron's quarks to
change flavour via the weak_interaction. The decay of one of the neutron's down
quarks into a lighter up quark can be achieved by the emission of a W_boson. By
this process, the Standard Model description of beta_decay, the neutron decays
into a proton (which contains one down and two up quarks), an electron, and an
electron_antineutrino.
Since interacting protons have a mutual electromagnetic_repulsion that is
stronger than their attractive nuclear_interaction, neutrons are a necessary
constituent of any atomic nucleus that contains more than one proton (see
diproton and neutronÃ¢Â€Â“proton_ratio).[47] Neutrons bind with protons and one
another in the nucleus via the nuclear_force, effectively moderating the
repulsive forces between the protons and stabilizing the nucleus.

**** Free neutron decay[edit] ****
Main article: Free_neutron_decay
Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean_lifetime of
881.5Ã‚Â±1.5Â s (about 14 minutes, 42 seconds); therefore the half-life for this
process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of ln(2) = 0.693) is
611.0Ã‚Â±1.0Â s (about 10 minutes, 11 seconds).[14] Beta decay of the neutron,
described above, can be denoted by the radioactive_decay:[48]

      n0
       Ã¢Â†Â’
      p+
       +
      eâˆ’
       +
      Î½
      e
where
p+
,
eâˆ’
, and
Î½
e denote the proton, electron and electron antineutrino, respectively. For the
free neutron the decay_energy for this process (based on the masses of the
neutron, proton, and electron) is 0.782343 MeV. The maximal energy of the beta
decay electron (in the process wherein the neutrino receives a vanishingly
small amount of kinetic energy) has been measured at 0.782 Ã‚Â± 0.013 MeV.[49]
The latter number is not well-enough measured to determine the comparatively
tiny rest mass of the neutrino (which must in theory be subtracted from the
maximal electron kinetic energy) as well as neutrino mass is constrained by
many other methods.
A small fraction (about one in 1000) of free neutrons decay with the same
products, but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted gamma ray:

      n0
       Ã¢Â†Â’
      p+
       +
      eâˆ’
       +
      Î½
      e +
      Î³
This gamma ray may be thought of as an "internal bremsstrahlung" that arises
from the electromagnetic interaction of the emitted beta particle with the
proton. Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of
beta decays of bound neutrons (as discussed below).
A schematic of the nucleus_of_an_atom indicating
Î²âˆ’
 radiation, the emission of a fast electron from the nucleus (the accompanying
antineutrino is omitted). In the Rutherford model for the nucleus, red spheres
were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound
to an electron with no net charge.
The inset shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an
electron and antineutrino are created in this process.
A very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called
"two-body (neutron) decays", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are
produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV necessary energy
to escape the proton (the ionization_energy of hydrogen), and therefore simply
remains bound to it, as a neutral hydrogen_atom (one of the "two bodies"). In
this type of free neutron decay, almost all of the neutron decay_energy is
carried off by the antineutrino (the other "body"). (The hydrogen atom recoils
with a speed of only about (decay energy)/(hydrogen rest energy) times the
speed of light, or 250Â km/s.)
The transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a
neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass
than a free proton. But a high-energy collision of a proton and an electron or
neutrino can result in a neutron.
**** Bound neutron decay[edit] ****
Main article: Atomic_nucleus
While a free neutron has a half life of about 10.2 min, most neutrons within
nuclei are stable. According to the nuclear_shell_model, the protons and
neutrons of a nuclide are a quantum_mechanical_system organized into discrete
energy_levels with unique quantum_numbers. For a neutron to decay, the
resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial
neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all
filled, meaning they are each occupied by two protons with spin up and spin
down. The Pauli_exclusion_principle therefore disallows the decay of a neutron
to a proton within stable nuclei. The situation is similar to electrons of an
atom, where electrons have distinct atomic_orbitals and are prevented from
decaying to lower energy states, with the emission of a photon, by the
exclusion principle.
Neutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by beta_decay as described above. In this
case, an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the proton
resulting from the decay. One example of this decay is carbon-14 (6 protons, 8
neutrons) that decays to nitrogen-14 (7 protons, 7 neutrons) with a half-life
of about 5,730 years.
Inside a nucleus, a proton can transform into a neutron via inverse_beta_decay,
if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the neutron. This
transformation occurs by emission of a positron and an electron neutrino:

      n0
       +
      e+
       +
      Î½
      e
The transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also
possible through electron_capture:

       +
      eâˆ’
       Ã¢Â†Â’
      n0
       +
      Î½
      e
Positron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons is
also possible, but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the positive
nucleus, and quickly annihilate when they encounter electrons.
**** Competition of beta decay types[edit] ****
Three types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope
copper-64 (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which has a half-life of about 12.7 hours.
This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the
proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide is almost equally
likely to undergo proton decay (by positron_emission, 18% or by electron
capture, 43%) or neutron decay (by electron emission, 39%).
***** Intrinsic properties[edit] *****
**** Mass[edit] ****
The mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by mass_spectrometry due to
lack of electric charge. However, since the masses of a proton and of a
deuteron can be measured with a mass spectrometer, the mass of a neutron can be
deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass, with the difference
being the mass of the neutron plus the binding_energy of deuterium (expressed
as a positive emitted energy). The latter can be directly measured by measuring
the energy (     B  d     {\displaystyle B_{d}}  [B_d]) of the single
0.7822Â MeV gamma photon emitted when neutrons are captured by protons (this is
exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons), plus the small recoil
kinetic energy (     E  r d     {\displaystyle E_{rd}}  [E_{rd}]) of the
deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy).
          m  n   =  m  d   &#x2212;  m  p   +  B  d   &#x2212;  E  r d
      {\displaystyle m_{n}=m_{d}-m_{p}+B_{d}-E_{rd}}  [{\displaystyle m_{n}=m_
      {d}-m_{p}+B_{d}-E_{rd}}]
The energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by X-ray
diffraction techniques, as was first done by Bell and Elliot in 1948. The best
modern (1986) values for neutron mass by this technique are provided by Greene,
et al.[50] These give a neutron mass of:
      mneutron= 1.008644904(14)Â u
The value for the neutron mass in MeV is less accurately known, due to less
accuracy in the known conversion of u to MeV:[51]
      mneutron= 939.56563(28)Â MeV/c2.
Another method to determine the mass of a neutron starts from the beta decay of
the neutron, when the momenta of the resulting proton and electron are
measured.
**** Electric charge[edit] ****
The total electric charge of the neutron is 0Â e. This zero value has been
tested experimentally, and the present experimental limit for the charge of the
neutron is Ã¢ÂˆÂ’2(8)ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’22Â e,[4] or Ã¢ÂˆÂ’3(13)ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’41Â C. This value is
consistent with zero, given the experimental uncertainties (indicated in
parentheses). By comparison, the charge of the proton is +1Â e.
**** Magnetic moment[edit] ****
Main article: Neutron_magnetic_moment
Even though the neutron is a neutral particle, the magnetic moment of a neutron
is not zero. The neutron is not affected by electric fields, but it is affected
by magnetic fields. The magnetic moment of the neutron is an indication of its
quark substructure and internal charge distribution.[52] The value for the
neutron's magnetic moment was first directly measured by Luis_Alvarez and Felix
Bloch at Berkeley,_California, in 1940.[53] Alvarez and Bloch determined the
magnetic moment of the neutron to be ÃŽÂ¼n= Ã¢ÂˆÂ’1.93(2)Â ÃŽÂ¼N, where ÃŽÂ¼N is the
nuclear_magneton.
In the quark_model for hadrons, the neutron is composed of one up quark (charge
+2/3Â e) and two down quarks (charge Ã¢ÂˆÂ’1/3Â e).[52] The magnetic moment of the
neutron can be modeled as a sum of the magnetic moments of the constituent
quarks.[54] The calculation assumes that the quarks behave like pointlike Dirac
particles, each having their own magnetic moment. Simplistically, the magnetic
moment of the neutron can be viewed as resulting from the vector sum of the
three quark magnetic moments, plus the orbital magnetic moments caused by the
movement of the three charged quarks within the neutron.
In one of the early successes of the Standard Model (SU(6)_theory, now
understood in terms of quark behavior), in 1964 Mirza A.B. Beg, Benjamin_W.
Lee, and Abraham_Pais theoretically calculated the ratio of proton to neutron
magnetic moments to be Ã¢ÂˆÂ’3/2, which agrees with the experimental value to
within 3%.[55][56][57] The measured value for this ratio is Ã¢ÂˆÂ’1.45989805(34).
[3] A contradiction of the quantum_mechanical basis of this calculation with
the Pauli_exclusion_principle, led to the discovery of the color_charge for
quarks by Oscar_W._Greenberg in 1964.[55]
The above treatment compares neutrons with protons, allowing the complex
behavior of quarks to be subtracted out between models, and merely exploring
what the effects would be of differing quark charges (or quark type). Such
calculations are enough to show that the interior of neutrons is very much like
that of protons, save for the difference in quark composition with a down quark
in the neutron replacing an up quark in the proton.
The neutron magnetic moment can be roughly computed by assuming a simple
nonrelativistic, quantum mechanical wavefunction for baryons composed of three
quarks. A straightforward calculation gives fairly accurate estimates for the
magnetic moments of neutrons, protons, and other baryons.[54] For a neutron,
the end result of this calculation is that the magnetic moment of the neutron
is given by ÃŽÂ¼n= 4/3 ÃŽÂ¼d Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ 1/3 ÃŽÂ¼u, where ÃŽÂ¼d and ÃŽÂ¼u are the magnetic
moments for the down and up quarks, respectively. This result combines the
intrinsic magnetic moments of the quarks with their orbital magnetic moments,
and assumes the three quarks are in a particular, dominant quantum state.

The results of this calculation are encouraging, but the masses of the up or
down quarks were assumed to be 1/3 the mass of a nucleon.[54] The masses of the
quarks are actually only about 1% that of a nucleon.[58] The discrepancy stems
from the complexity of the Standard Model for nucleons, where most of their
mass originates in the gluon fields, virtual particles, and their associated
energy that are essential aspects of the strong_force.[58][59] Furthermore, the
complex system of quarks and gluons that constitute a neutron requires a
relativistic treatment.[60] The nucleon magnetic moment has been successfully
computed numerically from first_principles, however, including all the effects
mentioned and using more realistic values for the quark masses. The calculation
gave results that were in fair agreement with measurement, but it required
significant computing resources.[61][62]
**** Spin[edit] ****
The neutron is a spin 1/2 particle, that is, it is a fermion with intrinsic
angular momentum equal to 1/2 Ã„Â§, where Ã„Â§ is the reduced_Planck_constant. For
many years after the discovery of the neutron, its exact spin was ambiguous.
Although it was assumed to be a spin 1/2 Dirac_particle, the possibility that
the neutron was a spin 3/2 particle lingered. The interactions of the neutron's
magnetic moment with an external magnetic field were exploited to finally
determine the spin of the neutron.[63] In 1949, Hughes and Burgy measured
neutrons reflected from a ferromagnetic mirror and found that the angular
distribution of the reflections was consistent with spin 1/2.[64] In 1954,
Sherwood, Stephenson, and Bernstein employed neutrons in a SternÃ¢Â€Â“Gerlach
experiment that used a magnetic field to separate the neutron spin states. They
recorded two such spin states, consistent with a spin 1/2 particle.[63][65]
As a fermion, the neutron is subject to the Pauli_exclusion_principle; two
neutrons cannot have the same quantum numbers. This is the source of the
degeneracy_pressure which makes neutron_stars possible.
See also: Delta_baryon
**** Structure and geometry of charge distribution[edit] ****
An article published in 2007 featuring a model-independent analysis concluded
that the neutron has a negatively charged exterior, a positively charged
middle, and a negative core.[66] In a simplified classical view, the negative
"skin" of the neutron assists it to be attracted to the protons with which it
interacts in the nucleus. (However, the main attraction between neutrons and
protons is via the nuclear_force, which does not involve electric charge.)
The simplified classical view of the neutron's charge distribution also
"explains" the fact that the neutron magnetic dipole points in the opposite
direction from its spin angular momentum vector (as compared to the proton).
This gives the neutron, in effect, a magnetic moment which resembles a
negatively charged particle. This can be reconciled classically with a neutral
neutron composed of a charge distribution in which the negative sub-parts of
the neutron have a larger average radius of distribution, and therefore
contribute more to the particle's magnetic dipole moment, than do the positive
parts that are, on average, nearer the core.
**** Electric dipole moment[edit] ****
Main article: Neutron_electric_dipole_moment
The Standard_Model_of_particle_physics predicts a tiny separation of positive
and negative charge within the neutron leading to a permanent electric_dipole
moment.[67] The predicted value is, however, well below the current sensitivity
of experiments. From several unsolved_puzzles_in_particle_physics, it is clear
that the Standard Model is not the final and full description of all particles
and their interactions. New theories going beyond_the_Standard_Model generally
lead to much larger predictions for the electric dipole moment of the neutron.
Currently, there are at least four experiments trying to measure for the first
time a finite neutron electric dipole moment, including:
    * Cryogenic_neutron_EDM_experiment being set up at the Institut
      LaueÃ¢Â€Â“Langevin[68]
    * nEDM experiment under construction at the new UCN source at the Paul
      Scherrer_Institute[69]
    * nEDM experiment being envisaged at the Spallation_Neutron_Source[70][71]
    * nEDM experiment being built at the Institut_LaueÃ¢Â€Â“Langevin[72]
**** Anti-neutron[edit] ****
Main article: Antineutron
The antineutron is the antiparticle of the neutron. It was discovered by Bruce
Cork in 1956, a year after the antiproton was discovered. CPT-symmetry puts
strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and antiparticles,
so studying antineutrons provides stringent tests on CPT-symmetry. The
fractional difference in the masses of the neutron and antineutron is
(9Ã‚Â±6)ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’5. Since the difference is only about two standard_deviations away
from zero, this does not give any convincing evidence of CPT-violation.[14]
***** Neutron compounds[edit] *****
**** Dineutrons and tetraneutrons[edit] ****
Main articles: Dineutron and Tetraneutron
The existence of stable clusters of 4 neutrons, or tetraneutrons, has been
hypothesised by a team led by Francisco-Miguel MarquÃƒÂ©s at the CNRS Laboratory
for Nuclear Physics based on observations of the disintegration of beryllium-14
nuclei. This is particularly interesting because current theory suggests that
these clusters should not be stable.
In February 2016, Japanese physicist Susumu Shimoura of the_University_of_Tokyo
and co-workers reported they had observed the purported tetraneutrons for the
first time experimentally.[73] Nuclear physicists around the world say this
discovery, if confirmed, would be a milestone in the field of nuclear physics
and certainly would deepen our understanding of the nuclear forces.[74][75]
The dineutron is another hypothetical particle. In 2012, Artemis Spyrou from
Michigan State University and coworkers reported that they observed, for the
first time, the dineutron emission in the decay of 16Be. The dineutron
character is evidenced by a small emission angle between the two neutrons. The
authors measured the two-neutron separation energy to be 1.35(10) MeV, in good
agreement with shell model calculations, using standard interactions for this
mass region.[76]
**** Neutronium and neutron stars[edit] ****
Main articles: Neutronium and Neutron_star
At extremely high pressures and temperatures, nucleons and electrons are
believed to collapse into bulk neutronic matter, called neutronium. This is
presumed to happen in neutron_stars.
The extreme pressure inside a neutron star may deform the neutrons into a cubic
symmetry, allowing tighter packing of neutrons.[77]
***** Detection[edit] *****
Main article: Neutron_detection
The common means of detecting a charged particle by looking for a track of
ionization (such as in a cloud_chamber) does not work for neutrons directly.
Neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that
is detectable, but the experiments are not as simple to carry out; other means
for detecting neutrons, consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic
nuclei, are more commonly used. The commonly used methods to detect neutrons
can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon,
mainly neutron_capture or elastic_scattering.[78]
**** Neutron detection by neutron capture[edit] ****
A common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released
from neutron_capture reactions into electrical signals. Certain nuclides have a
high neutron capture cross_section, which is the probability of absorbing a
neutron. Upon neutron capture, the compound nucleus emits more easily
detectable radiation, for example an alpha particle, which is then detected.

 are useful for this purpose.
**** Neutron detection by elastic scattering[edit] ****
Neutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, causing the struck nucleus to
recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can transfer more energy to a light nucleus
such as hydrogen or helium than to a heavier nucleus. Detectors relying on
elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can
ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or scintillation
light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal. A
major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from
erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector.
Fast neutron detectors have the advantage of not requiring a moderator, and are
therefore capable of measuring the neutron's energy, time of arrival, and in
certain cases direction of incidence.
***** Sources and production[edit] *****
Main articles: Neutron_source, Neutron_generator, and Research_reactor
Free neutrons are unstable, although they have the longest half-life of any
unstable subatomic particle by several orders of magnitude. Their half-life is
still only about 10 minutes, however, so they can be obtained only from sources
that produce them continuously.
Natural neutron background. A small natural background flux of free neutrons
exists everywhere on Earth. In the atmosphere and deep into the ocean, the
"neutron background" is caused by muons produced by cosmic_ray interaction with
the atmosphere. These high-energy muons are capable of penetration to
considerable depths in water and soil. There, in striking atomic nuclei, among
other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is
liberated from the nucleus. Within the Earth's crust a second source is
neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium
present in crustal minerals. The neutron background is not strong enough to be
a biological hazard, but it is of importance to very high resolution particle
detectors that are looking for very rare events, such as (hypothesized)
interactions that might be caused by particles of dark_matter.[9] Recent
research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies
of up to several tens of MeV.[79] Recent research has shown that the fluence of
these neutrons lies between 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’9 and 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’13 per ms and per m2 depending on
the detection altitude. The energy of most of these neutrons, even with initial
energies of 20 MeV, decreases down to the keV range within 1 ms.[80]
Even stronger neutron background radiation is produced at the surface of Mars,
where the atmosphere is thick enough to generate neutrons from cosmic ray muon
production and neutron-spallation, but not thick enough to provide significant
protection from the neutrons produced. These neutrons not only produce a
Martian surface neutron radiation hazard from direct downward-going neutron
radiation but may also produce a significant hazard from reflection of neutrons
from the Martian surface, which will produce reflected neutron radiation
penetrating upward into a Martian craft or habitat from the floor.[81]
Sources of neutrons for research. These include certain types of radioactive
decay (spontaneous_fission and neutron_emission), and from certain nuclear
reactions. Convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as
natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides, often beryllium or
deuterium, and induced nuclear_fission, such as occurs in nuclear reactors. In
addition, high-energy nuclear reactions (such as occur in cosmic radiation
showers or accelerator collisions) also produce neutrons from disintegration of
target nuclei. Small (tabletop) particle_accelerators optimized to produce free
neutrons in this way, are called neutron_generators.
In practice, the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use
radioactive decay to power neutron production. One noted neutron-producing
radioisotope, californium-252 decays (half-life 2.65 years) by spontaneous
fission 3% of the time with production of 3.7 neutrons per fission, and is used
alone as a neutron source from this process. Nuclear_reaction sources (that
involve two materials) powered by radioisotopes use an alpha_decay source plus
a beryllium target, or else a source of high-energy gamma radiation from a
source that undergoes beta_decay followed by gamma_decay, which produces
photoneutrons on interaction of the high-energy gamma_ray with ordinary stable
beryllium, or else with the deuterium in heavy_water. A popular source_of_the
latter_type is radioactive antimony-124 plus beryllium, a system with a half-
life of 60.9 days, which can be constructed from natural antimony (which is
42.8% stable antimony-123) by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor,
then transported to where the neutron source is needed.[82]
Institut_LaueÃ¢Â€Â“Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France Ã¢Â€Â“ a major neutron research
facility.
Nuclear_fission_reactors naturally produce free neutrons; their role is to
sustain the energy-producing chain_reaction. The intense neutron_radiation can
also be used to produce various radioisotopes through the process of neutron
activation, which is a type of neutron_capture.
Experimental nuclear_fusion_reactors produce free neutrons as a waste product.
However, it is these neutrons that possess most of the energy, and converting
that energy to a useful form has proved a difficult engineering challenge.
Fusion reactors that generate neutrons are likely to create radioactive waste,
but the waste is composed of neutron-activated lighter isotopes, which have
relatively short (50Ã¢Â€Â“100 years) decay periods as compared to typical half-
lives of 10,000 years[citation_needed] for fission waste, which is long due
primarily to the long half-life of alpha-emitting transuranic actinides.[83]
**** Neutron beams and modification of beams after production[edit] ****
Free neutron beams are obtained from neutron_sources by neutron_transport. For
access to intense neutron sources, researchers must go to a specialized neutron
facility that operates a research_reactor or a spallation source.
The neutron's lack of total electric charge makes it difficult to steer or
accelerate them. Charged particles can be accelerated, decelerated, or
deflected by electric or magnetic_fields. These methods have little effect on
neutrons. However, some effects may be attained by use of inhomogeneous
magnetic fields because of the neutron's_magnetic_moment. Neutrons can be
controlled by methods that include moderation, reflection, and velocity
selection. Thermal_neutrons can be polarized by transmission through magnetic
materials in a method analogous to the Faraday_effect for photons. Cold
neutrons of wavelengths of 6Ã¢Â€Â“7 angstroms can be produced in beams of a high
degree of polarization, by use of magnetic_mirrors and magnetized interference
filters.[84]

The neutron plays an important role in many nuclear reactions. For example,
neutron capture often results in neutron_activation, inducing radioactivity. In
particular, knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the
development of nuclear_reactors and nuclear_weapons. The fissioning of elements
like uranium-235 and plutonium-239 is caused by their absorption of neutrons.
Cold,_thermal,_and_hot neutron_radiation is commonly employed in neutron
scattering facilities, where the radiation is used in a similar way one uses X-
rays for the analysis of condensed_matter. Neutrons are complementary to the
latter in terms of atomic contrasts by different scattering cross_sections;
sensitivity to magnetism; energy range for inelastic neutron spectroscopy; and
deep penetration into matter.
The development of "neutron lenses" based on total internal reflection within
hollow glass capillary tubes or by reflection from dimpled aluminum plates has
driven ongoing research into neutron microscopy and neutron/gamma ray
tomography.[85][86][87]
A major use of neutrons is to excite delayed and prompt gamma_rays from
elements in materials. This forms the basis of neutron_activation_analysis
(NAA) and prompt_gamma_neutron_activation_analysis (PGNAA). NAA is most often
used to analyze small samples of materials in a nuclear_reactor whilst PGNAA is
most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around bore_holes and industrial
bulk materials on conveyor belts.
Another use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei, in particular
the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron collides with a
light nucleus, it loses a large fraction of its energy. By measuring the rate
at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen
nuclei, a neutron_probe may determine the water content in soil.
***** Medical therapies[edit] *****
Main articles: Fast_neutron_therapy and Neutron_capture_therapy_of_cancer
Because neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing, it can be exploited
for medical treatments. Neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side-effect
of leaving the affected area radioactive, however. Neutron_tomography is
therefore not a viable medical application.
Fast neutron therapy utilizes high-energy neutrons typically greater than 20
MeV to treat cancer. Radiation_therapy of cancers is based upon the biological
response of cells to ionizing radiation. If radiation is delivered in small
sessions to damage cancerous areas, normal tissue will have time to repair
itself, while tumor cells often cannot.[88] Neutron radiation can deliver
energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than gamma
radiation.[89]
Beams of low-energy neutrons are used in boron_capture_therapy to treat cancer.
In boron capture therapy, the patient is given a drug that contains boron and
that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted. The tumor is then
bombarded with very low-energy neutrons (although often higher than thermal
energy) which are captured by the boron-10 isotope in the boron, which produces
an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to produce lithium-7 and an alpha
particle that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell, but
insufficient range to damage nearby cells. For such a therapy to be applied to
the treatment of cancer, a neutron source having an intensity of the order of a
thousand million (109) neutrons per second per cm2 is preferred. Such fluxes
require a research nuclear reactor.
***** Protection[edit] *****
Exposure to free neutrons can be hazardous, since the interaction of neutrons
with molecules in the body can cause disruption to molecules and atoms, and can
also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of radiation (such as
protons). The normal precautions of radiation protection apply: Avoid exposure,
stay as far from the source as possible, and keep exposure time to a minimum.
Some particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure,
however. For other types of radiation, e.g., alpha_particles, beta_particles,
or gamma_rays, material of a high atomic number and with high density make for
good shielding; frequently, lead is used. However, this approach will not work
with neutrons, since the absorption of neutrons does not increase
straightforwardly with atomic number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma
radiation. Instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons
have with matter (see the section on detection above). For example, hydrogen-
rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary
hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons. This often means that simple
concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection
from neutrons than do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may
then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons
without causing secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.
Hydrogen-rich ordinary_water affects neutron absorption in nuclear_fission
reactors: Usually, neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel
enrichment with fissionable isotope is required.[clarification_needed] The
deuterium in heavy_water has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons
than does protium (normal light hydrogen). Deuterium is, therefore, used in
CANDU-type reactors, in order to slow (moderate) neutron velocity, to increase
the probability of nuclear_fission compared to neutron_capture.
***** Neutron temperature[edit] *****
Main article: Neutron_temperature
**** Thermal neutrons[edit] ****
Thermal neutrons are free_neutrons whose energies have a MaxwellÃ¢Â€Â“Boltzmann
distribution with kT= 0.0253Â eV (4.0ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’21Â J) at room temperature. This
gives characteristic (not average, or median) speed of 2.2Â km/s. The name
'thermal' comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or
material they are permeating. (see kinetic_theory for energies and speeds of
molecules). After a number of collisions (often in the range of 10Ã¢Â€Â“20) with
nuclei, neutrons arrive at this energy level, provided that they are not
absorbed.
In many substances, thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective
cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons, and thermal neutrons
can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e., with higher probability) by any
atomic_nuclei that they collide with, creating a heavier Ã¢Â€Â“ and often unstable
Ã¢Â€Â“ isotope of the chemical_element as a result.
Most fission_reactors use a neutron_moderator to slow down, or thermalize the
neutrons that are emitted by nuclear_fission so that they are more easily
captured, causing further fission. Others, called fast_breeder reactors, use
fission energy neutrons directly.
**** Cold neutrons[edit] ****
Cold neutrons are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold
substance such as liquid deuterium. Such a cold source is placed in the
moderator of a research reactor or spallation source. Cold neutrons are
particularly valuable for neutron_scattering experiments.[citation_needed]
Cold neutron source providing neutrons at about the temperature of liquid
hydrogen
**** Ultracold neutrons[edit] ****
Ultracold_neutrons are produced by elastically scattering cold neutrons in
substances with a temperature of a few kelvins, such as solid deuterium or
superfluid helium. An alternative production method is the mechanical
deceleration of cold neutrons.
**** Fission energy neutrons[edit] ****
Main article: Nuclear_fission
A fast neutron is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to 1Â MeV
(1.6ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’13Â J), hence a speed of ~14000Â km/s (~â€Š5% of the speed of light).
They are named fission energy or fast neutrons to distinguish them from lower-
energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or
accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as nuclear
fission. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have a
MaxwellÃ¢Â€Â“Boltzmann_distribution of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean
energy of 2 MeV (for U-235 fission neutrons), and a mode of only 0.75 MeV,
which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and thus have
almost no chance of initiating fission in fertile_materials, such as U-238 and
Th-232).
Fast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called
moderation. This is done with a neutron_moderator. In reactors, typically heavy
water, light_water, or graphite are used to moderate neutrons.
**** Fusion neutrons[edit] ****
The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes
and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about
70Â keV, or 800 million kelvins) and at a higher value than other reactions
commonly considered for fusion energy.
Further information: Nuclear_fusion_Ã‚Â§Â Criteria_and_candidates_for_terrestrial
reactions
DÃ¢Â€Â“T (deuteriumÃ¢Â€Â“tritium) fusion is the fusion_reaction that produces the
most energetic neutrons, with 14.1 MeV of kinetic_energy and traveling at 17%
of the speed_of_light. DÃ¢Â€Â“T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to
ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei
have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1 MeV that will be
produced.
14.1 MeV neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons, and
are very effective at fissioning even non-fissile heavy_nuclei, and these high-
energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower-energy
neutrons. This makes DÃ¢Â€Â“T fusion neutron sources such as proposed tokamak
power reactors useful for transmutation of transuranic waste. 14.1 MeV neutrons
can also produce neutrons by knocking_them_loose_from_nuclei.
On the other hand, these very high-energy neutrons are less likely to simply be
captured_without_causing_fission_or_spallation. For these reasons, nuclear
weapon_design extensively utilizes DÃ¢Â€Â“T fusion 14.1 MeV neutrons to cause_more
fission. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile
materials, such as depleted_uranium (uranium-238), and these materials have
been used in the jackets of thermonuclear_weapons. Fusion neutrons also can
cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into
primary fission bombs, such as reactor_grade_plutonium. This physical fact thus
causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain
nuclear_proliferation discussions and treaties.
Other fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons. DÃ¢Â€Â“D fusion
produces a 2.45 MeV neutron and helium-3 half of the time, and produces tritium
and a proton but no neutron the rest of the time. DÃ¢Â€Â“3He fusion produces no
neutron.
**** Intermediate-energy neutrons[edit] ****
Transmutation flow in light_water_reactor, which is a thermal-spectrum reactor
A fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal
energies is called an epithermal neutron.
Cross_sections for both capture and fission reactions often have multiple
resonance peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range. These are
of less significance in a fast_neutron_reactor, where most neutrons are
absorbed before slowing down to this range, or in a well-moderated thermal
reactor, where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei, not
with either fissile or fertile actinide nuclides. However, in a partially
moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy
metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for transient changes in
reactivity that might make reactor control more difficult.
Ratios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more captures
without fission) in most nuclear_fuels such as plutonium-239, making
epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable, as captures not
only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a nuclide that
is not fissile with thermal or epithermal neutrons, though still fissionable
with fast neutrons. The exception is uranium-233 of the thorium_cycle, which
has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron energies.
**** High-energy neutrons[edit] ****
High-energy neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are
generated as secondary particles by particle_accelerators or in the atmosphere
from cosmic_rays. These high-energy neutrons are extremely efficient at
ionization and far more likely to cause cell death than X-rays or protons.[90]

  16.  PDF_with_2011_partial_update_for_the_2012_edition The exact value of the
      mean lifetime is still uncertain, due to conflicting results from
      experiments. The Particle Data Group reports values up to six seconds
      apart (more than four standard deviations), commenting that "our 2006,
      2008, and 2010 Reviews stayed with 885.7Ã‚Â±0.8 s; but we noted that in
      light of SEREBROV 05 our value should be regarded as suspect until
      further experiments clarified matters. Since our 2010 Review, PICHLMAIER
      10 has obtained a mean life of 880.7Ã‚Â±1.8 s, closer to the value of
      SEREBROV 05 than to our average. And SEREBROV 10B[...] claims their
      values should be lowered by about 6 s, which would bring them into line
      with the two lower values. However, those reevaluations have not received
      an enthusiastic response from the experimenters in question; and in any
      case the Particle Data Group would have to await published changes (by
      those experimenters) of published values. At this point, we can think of
      nothing better to do than to average the seven best but discordant
      measurements, getting 881.5Ã‚Â±1.5s. Note that the error includes a scale
      factor of 2.7. This is a jump of 4.2 old (and 2.8 new) standard
      deviations. This state of affairs is a particularly unhappy one, because
      the value is so important. We again call upon the experimenters to clear
      this up."
