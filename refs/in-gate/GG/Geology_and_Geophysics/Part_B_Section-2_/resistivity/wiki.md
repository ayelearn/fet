This article is about electrical conductivity in general. For other types of
conductivity, see Conductivity. For specific applications in electrical
elements, see Electrical_resistance_and_conductance.
A measure of a substance's ability to resist or conduct electric current
Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance or volume
resistivity) and its inverse, electrical conductivity, is a fundamental
property of a material that quantifies how strongly it resists or conducts
electric_current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows
electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek_letter ÃÂ
(rho). The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-metre (ÃÂ©Ã¢Â‹Â…m).[1][2]
[3] For example, if a 1 m ÃƒÂ— 1 m ÃƒÂ— 1 m solid cube of material has sheet
contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is
1Â ÃÂ©, then the resistivity of the material is 1Â ÃÂ©Ã¢Â‹Â…m.
Electrical conductivity or specific conductance is the reciprocal of electrical
resistivity. It represents a material's ability to conduct electric current. It
is commonly signified by the Greek letter ÃÂƒ (sigma), but ÃÂº (kappa)
(especially in electrical engineering) and ÃÂ³ (gamma) are sometimes used. The
SI unit of electrical conductivity is siemens per metre (S/m).

***** Definition[edit] *****
**** Ideal case[edit] ****
A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.
In an ideal case, cross-section and physical composition of the examined
material are uniform across the sample, and the electric field and current
density are both parallel and constant everywhere. Many resistors and
conductors do in fact have a uniform cross section with a uniform flow of
electric current, and are made of a single material, so that this is a good
model. (See the adjacent diagram.) When this is the case, the electrical
resistivity ÃÂ (Greek: rho) can be calculated by:
         &#x03C1; = R   A &#x2113;   ,     {\displaystyle \rho =R{\frac {A}
      {\ell }},\,\!}  [\rho =R{\frac {A}{\ell }},\,\!]
where
         R   {\displaystyle R}  [R] is the electrical_resistance of a uniform
      specimen of the material
         &#x2113;   {\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ] is the length of the
      specimen
         A   {\displaystyle A}  [A] is the cross-sectional_area of the specimen
Both resistance and resistivity describe how difficult it is to make electrical
current flow through a material, but unlike resistance, resistivity is an
intrinsic_property. This means that all pure copper wires (which have not been
subjected to distortion of their crystalline structure etc.), irrespective of
their shape and size, have the same resistivity, but a long, thin copper wire
has a much larger resistance than a thick, short copper wire. Every material
has its own characteristic resistivity. For example, rubber has a far larger
resistivity than copper.
In a hydraulic_analogy, passing current through a high-resistivity material is
like pushing water through a pipe full of sandÃ¢Â€Â”while passing current through
a low-resistivity material is like pushing water through an empty pipe. If the
pipes are the same size and shape, the pipe full of sand has higher resistance
to flow. Resistance, however, is not solely determined by the presence or
absence of sand. It also depends on the length and width of the pipe: short or
wide pipes have lower resistance than narrow or long pipes.
The above equation can be transposed to get Pouillet's law (named after Claude
Pouillet):
         R = &#x03C1;   &#x2113; A   .     {\displaystyle R=\rho {\frac {\ell }
      {A}}.\,\!}  [R=\rho {\frac {\ell }{A}}.\,\!]
The resistance of a given material is proportional to the length, but inversely
proportional to the cross-sectional area. Thus resistivity can be expressed
using the SI unit "ohm metre" (ÃÂ©Ã¢Â‹Â…m) (i.e ohms divided by metres (for the
length) and then multiplied by square metres (for the cross-sectional area)}.
For example, if A = 1Â m2     &#x2113;   {\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ] = 1Â m
(forming a cube with perfectly conductive contacts on opposite faces), then the
resistance of this element in ohms is numerically equal to the resistivity of
the material it is made of in ÃÂ©Ã¢Â‹Â…m.
Conductivity, ÃÂƒ, is the inverse of resistivity:
         &#x03C3; =   1 &#x03C1;   .     {\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {1}{\rho
      }}.\,\!}  [{\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {1}{\rho }}.\,\!}]
Conductivity has SI units of "siemens per metre" (S/m).
**** General scalar case[edit] ****
For less ideal cases, such as more complicated geometry, or when the current
and electric field vary in different parts of the material, it is necessary to
use a more general expression in which the resistivity at a particular point is
defined as the ratio of the electric_field to the density of the current it
creates at that point:
         &#x03C1; =   E J   ,     {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {E}{J}},\,\!}
      [\rho ={\frac {E}{J}},\,\!]
where
         &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is the resistivity of the
      conductor material,
         E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] is the magnitude of the electric field,
         J   {\displaystyle J}  [J] is the magnitude of the current_density,
in which     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] and     J   {\displaystyle J}  [J] are
inside the conductor.
Conductivity is the inverse (reciprocal) of resistivity. Here, it is given by:
         &#x03C3; =   1 &#x03C1;   =   J E   .     {\displaystyle \sigma =
      {\frac {1}{\rho }}={\frac {J}{E}}.\,\!}  [\sigma ={\frac {1}{\rho }}=
      {\frac {J}{E}}.\,\!]
For example, rubber is a material with large ÃÂ and small ÃÂƒÃ¢Â€Â”because even a
very large electric field in rubber makes almost no current flow through it. On
the other hand, copper is a material with small ÃÂ and large ÃÂƒÃ¢Â€Â”because even
a small electric field pulls a lot of current through it.
As shown below, this expression simplifies to a single number when the electric
field and current density are constant in the material.
      Derivation from general definition of resistivity
      There are three equations to be combined here. The first is the
      resistivity for parallel current and electric field:
               &#x03C1; =   E J   ,     {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {E}
            {J}},\,\!}  [\rho ={\frac {E}{J}},\,\!]
      If the electric field is constant, the electric field is given by the
      total voltage V across the conductor divided by length Ã¢Â„Â“ of the
      conductor:
               E = V  /  &#x2113;   {\displaystyle E=V/\ell }  [{\displaystyle
            E=V/\ell }]
      If the current density is constant, it is equal to the total current
      divided by the cross sectional area:
               J = I  /  A   {\displaystyle J=I/A}  [{\displaystyle J=I/A}]
      Plugging in the values of E and J into the first expression, we obtain:
               &#x03C1; =    V A   I &#x2113;      {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac
            {VA}{I\ell }}}  [{\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {VA}{I\ell }}}]
      Finally, we apply Ohm's law, V/IÂ =Â R.
               &#x03C1; = R   A &#x2113;     {\displaystyle \rho =R{\frac {A}
            {\ell }}}  [{\displaystyle \rho =R{\frac {A}{\ell }}}]
**** Tensor resistivity[edit] ****
When the resistivity of a material has a directional component, the most
general definition of resistivity must be used. It starts from the tensor-
vector form of Ohm's_law which relates the electric field inside a material to
the electric current flow. This equation is completely general, meaning it is
valid in all cases, including those mentioned above. However, this definition
is the most complicated, so it is only directly used in anisotropic cases,
where the more simple definitions cannot be applied. If the material is not
anisotropic, it is safe to ignore the tensor-vector definition, and use a
simpler expression instead.
Here, anisotropic means that the material has different properties in different
directions. For example, a crystal of graphite consists microscopically of a
stack of sheets, and current flows very easily through each sheet, but much
less easily from one sheet to the adjacent one.[4] In such cases, the current
does not flow in exactly the same direction as the electric field. Thus, the
appropriate equations are generalized to the three-dimensional tensor form:[5]
[6]
          J  =  &#x03C3;   E    &#x21CC;    E  =  &#x03C1;   J
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} ={\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\mathbf {E}
      \,\,\rightleftharpoons \,\,\mathbf {E} ={\boldsymbol {\rho }}\mathbf {J}
      \,\!}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} ={\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\mathbf {E}
      \,\,\rightleftharpoons \,\,\mathbf {E} ={\boldsymbol {\rho }}\mathbf {J}
      \,\!}]
where the conductivity ÃÂƒ and resistivity ÃÂ are rank-2 tensors, and electric
field E and current density J are vectors. These tensors can be represented by
3ÃƒÂ—3 matrices, the vectors with 3x1 matrices, with matrix_multiplication used
on the right side of these equations. In matrix form, the resistivity relation
is given by:
           [     E  x        E  y        E  z      ]   =   [     &#x03C1;  x x
      &#x03C1;  x y      &#x03C1;  x z        &#x03C1;  y x      &#x03C1;  y y
      &#x03C1;  y z        &#x03C1;  z x      &#x03C1;  z y      &#x03C1;  z z
      ]     [     J  x        J  y        J  z      ]     {\displaystyle
      {\begin{bmatrix}E_{x}\\E_{y}\\E_{z}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\rho _
      {xx}&\rho _{xy}&\rho _{xz}\\\rho _{yx}&\rho _{yy}&\rho _{yz}\\\rho _
      {zx}&\rho _{zy}&\rho _{zz}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}J_{x}\\J_{y}\\J_
      {z}\end{bmatrix}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}E_{x}\\E_{y}\\E_
      {z}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\rho _{xx}&\rho _{xy}&\rho _{xz}\\\rho
      _{yx}&\rho _{yy}&\rho _{yz}\\\rho _{zx}&\rho _{zy}&\rho _{zz}\end
      {bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}J_{x}\\J_{y}\\J_{z}\end{bmatrix}}}]
where
          E    {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} }  [\mathbf {E} ] is the electric
      field vector, with components (Ex, Ey, Ez).
          &#x03C1;    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\rho }}}  [{\boldsymbol
      {\rho }}] is the resistivity tensor, in general a three by three matrix.
          J    {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} }  [\mathbf {J} ] is the electric
      current density vector, with components (Jx, Jy, Jz)
Equivalently, resistivity can be given in the more compact Einstein_notation:
           E   i   =   &#x03C1;   i j     J   j     {\displaystyle \mathbf {E}
      _{i}={\boldsymbol {\rho }}_{ij}\mathbf {J} _{j}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf
      {E} _{i}={\boldsymbol {\rho }}_{ij}\mathbf {J} _{j}}]
In either case, the resulting expression for each electric field component is:
          E  x   =  &#x03C1;  x x    J  x   +  &#x03C1;  x y    J  y   +
      &#x03C1;  x z    J  z   .   {\displaystyle E_{x}=\rho _{xx}J_{x}+\rho _
      {xy}J_{y}+\rho _{xz}J_{z}.}  [{\displaystyle E_{x}=\rho _{xx}J_{x}+\rho _
      {xy}J_{y}+\rho _{xz}J_{z}.}]
          E  y   =  &#x03C1;  y x    J  x   +  &#x03C1;  y y    J  y   +
      &#x03C1;  y z    J  z   .   {\displaystyle E_{y}=\rho _{yx}J_{x}+\rho _
      {yy}J_{y}+\rho _{yz}J_{z}.}  [{\displaystyle E_{y}=\rho _{yx}J_{x}+\rho _
      {yy}J_{y}+\rho _{yz}J_{z}.}]
          E  z   =  &#x03C1;  z x    J  x   +  &#x03C1;  z y    J  y   +
      &#x03C1;  z z    J  z   .   {\displaystyle E_{z}=\rho _{zx}J_{x}+\rho _
      {zy}J_{y}+\rho _{zz}J_{z}.}  [{\displaystyle E_{z}=\rho _{zx}J_{x}+\rho _
      {zy}J_{y}+\rho _{zz}J_{z}.}]
Since the choice of the coordinate system is free, the usual convention is to
simplify the expression by choosing an x-axis parallel to the current
direction, so JyÂ =Â JzÂ =Â 0. This leaves:
          &#x03C1;  x x   =    E  x    J  x     ,   &#x03C1;  y x   =    E  y
      J  x     ,  &#xA0;and&#xA0;   &#x03C1;  z x   =    E  z    J  x     .
      {\displaystyle \rho _{xx}={\frac {E_{x}}{J_{x}}},\quad \rho _{yx}={\frac
      {E_{y}}{J_{x}}},{\text{ and }}\rho _{zx}={\frac {E_{z}}{J_{x}}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle \rho _{xx}={\frac {E_{x}}{J_{x}}},\quad \rho _{yx}={\frac
      {E_{y}}{J_{x}}},{\text{ and }}\rho _{zx}={\frac {E_{z}}{J_{x}}}.}]
Conductivity is defined similarly:[7]
           [     J  x        J  y        J  z      ]   =   [     &#x03C3;  x x
      &#x03C3;  x y      &#x03C3;  x z        &#x03C3;  y x      &#x03C3;  y y
      &#x03C3;  y z        &#x03C3;  z x      &#x03C3;  z y      &#x03C3;  z z
      ]     [     E  x        E  y        E  z      ]     {\displaystyle
      {\begin{bmatrix}J_{x}\\J_{y}\\J_{z}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\sigma
      _{xx}&\sigma _{xy}&\sigma _{xz}\\\sigma _{yx}&\sigma _{yy}&\sigma _
      {yz}\\\sigma _{zx}&\sigma _{zy}&\sigma _{zz}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {bmatrix}E_{x}\\E_{y}\\E_{z}\end{bmatrix}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin
      {bmatrix}J_{x}\\J_{y}\\J_{z}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\sigma _
      {xx}&\sigma _{xy}&\sigma _{xz}\\\sigma _{yx}&\sigma _{yy}&\sigma _
      {yz}\\\sigma _{zx}&\sigma _{zy}&\sigma _{zz}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin
      {bmatrix}E_{x}\\E_{y}\\E_{z}\end{bmatrix}}}]
or
           J   i   =   &#x03C3;   i j     E   j     {\displaystyle \mathbf {J}
      _{i}={\boldsymbol {\sigma }}_{ij}\mathbf {E} _{j}}  [{\displaystyle
      \mathbf {J} _{i}={\boldsymbol {\sigma }}_{ij}\mathbf {E} _{j}}]
Both resulting in:
          J  x   =  &#x03C3;  x x    E  x   +  &#x03C3;  x y    E  y   +
      &#x03C3;  x z    E  z     {\displaystyle J_{x}=\sigma _{xx}E_{x}+\sigma _
      {xy}E_{y}+\sigma _{xz}E_{z}}  [{\displaystyle J_{x}=\sigma _{xx}E_
      {x}+\sigma _{xy}E_{y}+\sigma _{xz}E_{z}}]
          J  y   =  &#x03C3;  y x    E  x   +  &#x03C3;  y y    E  y   +
      &#x03C3;  y z    E  z     {\displaystyle J_{y}=\sigma _{yx}E_{x}+\sigma _
      {yy}E_{y}+\sigma _{yz}E_{z}}  [{\displaystyle J_{y}=\sigma _{yx}E_
      {x}+\sigma _{yy}E_{y}+\sigma _{yz}E_{z}}]
          J  z   =  &#x03C3;  z x    E  x   +  &#x03C3;  z y    E  y   +
      &#x03C3;  z z    E  z     {\displaystyle J_{z}=\sigma _{zx}E_{x}+\sigma _
      {zy}E_{y}+\sigma _{zz}E_{z}}  [{\displaystyle J_{z}=\sigma _{zx}E_
      {x}+\sigma _{zy}E_{y}+\sigma _{zz}E_{z}}]
Looking at the two expressions,      &#x03C1;    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol
{\rho }}}  [{\boldsymbol  {\rho }}] and      &#x03C3;    {\displaystyle
{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}}  [{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}] are the matrix_inverse of
each other. However, in the most general case, the individual matrix elements
are not necessarily reciprocals of one another; for example, ÃÂƒxx may not be
equal to 1/ÃÂxx. This can be seen in the Hall_effect, where      &#x03C1;  x y
{\displaystyle \rho _{xy}}  [{\displaystyle \rho _{xy}}] is nonzero. In the
Hall effect, due to rotational invariance about the z-axis,      &#x03C1;  y y
=  &#x03C1;  x x     {\displaystyle \rho _{yy}=\rho _{xx}}  [{\displaystyle
\rho _{yy}=\rho _{xx}}] and      &#x03C1;  y x   = &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  x y
{\displaystyle \rho _{yx}=-\rho _{xy}}  [{\displaystyle \rho _{yx}=-\rho _
{xy}}], so the relation between resistivity and conductivity simplifies to:[8]
          &#x03C3;  x x   =    &#x03C1;  x x     &#x03C1;  x x   2   +
      &#x03C1;  x y   2      ,   &#x03C3;  x y   =    &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  x y
      &#x03C1;  x x   2   +  &#x03C1;  x y   2        {\displaystyle \sigma _
      {xx}={\frac {\rho _{xx}}{\rho _{xx}^{2}+\rho _{xy}^{2}}},\quad \sigma _
      {xy}={\frac {-\rho _{xy}}{\rho _{xx}^{2}+\rho _{xy}^{2}}}}  [
      {\displaystyle \sigma _{xx}={\frac {\rho _{xx}}{\rho _{xx}^{2}+\rho _
      {xy}^{2}}},\quad \sigma _{xy}={\frac {-\rho _{xy}}{\rho _{xx}^{2}+\rho _
      {xy}^{2}}}}]
If the electric field is parallel to the applied current,      &#x03C1;  x y
{\displaystyle \rho _{xy}}  [{\displaystyle \rho _{xy}}] and      &#x03C1;  x z
{\displaystyle \rho _{xz}}  [{\displaystyle \rho _{xz}}] are zero. When they
are zero, one number,      &#x03C1;  x x     {\displaystyle \rho _{xx}}  [
{\displaystyle \rho _{xx}}], is enough to describe the electrical resistivity.
It is then written as simply     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ], and
this reduces to the simpler expression.
***** Causes of conductivity[edit] *****
**** Band theory simplified[edit] ****
See also: Band_theory
Filling of the electronic states in various types of materials at equilibrium.
Here, height is energy while width is the density_of_available_states for a
certain energy in the material listed. The shade follows the FermiÃ¢Â€Â“Dirac
distribution (black = all states filled, white = no state filled). In metals
and semimetals the Fermi_level EF lies inside at least one band. In insulators
and semiconductors the Fermi level is inside a band_gap; however, in
semiconductors the bands are near enough to the Fermi level to be thermally
populated with electrons or holes.
                                                                           edit
According to elementary quantum_mechanics, an electron in an atom or crystal
can only have certain precise energy levels; energies between these levels are
impossible. When a large number of such allowed levels have close-spaced energy
values Ã¢Â€Â“ i.e. have energies that differ only minutely Ã¢Â€Â“ those close energy
levels in combination are called an "energy band". There can be many such
energy bands in a material, depending on the atomic number of the constituent
atoms[a] and their distribution within the crystal.[b]
The material's electrons seek to minimize the total energy in the material by
settling into low energy states; however, the Pauli_exclusion_principle means
that only one can exist in each such state. So the electrons "fill up" the band
structure starting from the bottom. The characteristic energy level up to which
the electrons have filled is called the Fermi_level. The position of the Fermi
level with respect to the band structure is very important for electrical
conduction: Only electrons in energy levels near or above the Fermi_level are
free to move within the broader material structure, since the electrons can
easily jump among the partially occupied states in that region. In contrast,
the low energy states are completely filled with a fixed limit on the number of
electrons at all times, and the high energy states are empty of electrons at
all times.
Electric current consists of a flow of electrons. In metals there are many
electron energy levels near the Fermi level, so there are many electrons
available to move. This is what causes the high electronic conductivity of
metals.
An important part of band theory is that there may be forbidden bands of
energy: energy intervals that contain no energy levels. In insulators and
semiconductors, the number of electrons is just the right amount to fill a
certain integer number of low energy bands, exactly to the boundary. In this
case, the Fermi level falls within a band gap. Since there are no available
states near the Fermi level, and the electrons are not freely movable, the
electronic conductivity is very low.
**** In metals[edit] ****
Main article: Free_electron_model
Like balls in a Newton's_cradle, electrons in a metal quickly transfer energy
from one terminal to another, despite their own negligible movement.
A metal consists of a lattice of atoms, each with an outer shell of electrons
that freely dissociate from their parent atoms and travel through the lattice.
This is also known as a positive ionic lattice.[9] This 'sea' of dissociable
electrons allows the metal to conduct electric current. When an electrical
potential difference (a voltage) is applied across the metal, the resulting
electric field causes electrons to drift towards the positive terminal. The
actual drift_velocity of electrons is typically small, on the order of
magnitude of meters per hour. However, due to the sheer number of moving
electrons, even a slow drift velocity results in a large current_density.[10]
The mechanism is similar to transfer of momentum of balls in a Newton's_cradle
[11] but the rapid propagation of an electric energy along a wire is not due to
the mechanical forces, but the propagation of an energy-carrying
electromagnetic field guided by the wire.
Most metals have electrical resistance. In simpler models (non quantum
mechanical models) this can be explained by replacing electrons and the crystal
lattice by a wave-like structure. When the electron wave travels through the
lattice, the waves interfere, which causes resistance. The more regular the
lattice is, the less disturbance happens and thus the less resistance. The
amount of resistance is thus mainly caused by two factors. First, it is caused
by the temperature and thus amount of vibration of the crystal lattice. The
temperature causes bigger vibrations, which act as irregularities in the
lattice. Second, the purity of the metal is relevant as a mixture of different
ions is also an irregularity.[12][13]
**** In semiconductors and insulators[edit] ****
Main articles: Semiconductor and Insulator_(electricity)
In metals, the Fermi_level lies in the conduction_band (see Band Theory, above)
giving rise to free conduction electrons. However, in semiconductors the
position of the Fermi level is within the band gap, about halfway between the
conduction band minimum (the bottom of the first band of unfilled electron
energy levels) and the valence band maximum (the top of the band below the
conduction band, of filled electron energy levels). That applies for intrinsic
(undoped) semiconductors. This means that at absolute zero temperature, there
would be no free conduction electrons, and the resistance is infinite. However,
the resistance decreases as the charge carrier density (i.e., without
introducing further complications, the density of electrons) in the conduction
band increases. In extrinsic (doped) semiconductors, dopant atoms increase the
majority charge carrier concentration by donating electrons to the conduction
band or producing holes in the valence band. (A "hole" is a position where an
electron is missing; such holes can behave in a similar way to electrons.) For
both types of donor or acceptor atoms, increasing dopant density reduces
resistance. Hence, highly doped semiconductors behave metallically. At very
high temperatures, the contribution of thermally generated carriers dominates
over the contribution from dopant atoms, and the resistance decreases
exponentially with temperature.
**** In ionic liquids/electrolytes[edit] ****
Main article: Conductivity_(electrolytic)
In electrolytes, electrical conduction happens not by band electrons or holes,
but by full atomic species (ions) traveling, each carrying an electrical
charge. The resistivity of ionic solutions (electrolytes) varies tremendously
with concentration Ã¢Â€Â“ while distilled water is almost an insulator, salt_water
is a reasonable electrical conductor. Conduction in ionic_liquids is also
controlled by the movement of ions, but here we are talking about molten salts
rather than solvated ions. In biological_membranes, currents are carried by
ionic salts. Small holes in cell membranes, called ion_channels, are selective
to specific ions and determine the membrane resistance.
**** Superconductivity[edit] ****
Main article: Superconductivity
The electrical resistivity of a metallic conductor decreases gradually as
temperature is lowered. In ordinary conductors, such as copper or silver, this
decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near absolute_zero, a
real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor,
the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its
critical temperature. An electric current flowing in a loop of superconducting
wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.[14]
In 1986, researchers discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials
have much higher critical temperatures, and in 1987 one was produced with a
critical temperature above 90Â K (Ã¢ÂˆÂ’183Â Ã‚Â°C).[15] Such a high transition
temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional_superconductor, so
the researchers named these conductors high-temperature_superconductors. Liquid
nitrogen boils at 77Â K, cold enough to activate high-temperature
superconductors, but not nearly cold enough for conventional superconductors.
In conventional superconductors, electrons are held together in pairs by an
attraction mediated by lattice phonons.[clarification_needed] The best
available model of high-temperature superconductivity is still somewhat crude.
There is a hypothesis that electron pairing in high-temperature superconductors
is mediated by short-range spin waves known as paramagnons.[16][dubious  â€“
discuss]
**** Plasma[edit] ****
Main article: Plasma_(physics)
Lightning is an example of plasma present at Earth's surface. Typically,
lightning discharges 30,000 amperes at up to 100 million volts, and emits
light, radio waves, and X-rays.[17] Plasma temperatures in lightning might
approach 30,000 Kelvin (29,727Â Ã‚Â°C) (53,540Â Ã‚Â°F), or five times hotter than the
temperature at the sun surface, and electron densities may exceed 1024 mÃ¢ÂˆÂ’3.
Plasmas are very good conductors and electric potentials play an important
role.
The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles,
independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the plasma
potential, or space potential. If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its
potential generally lies considerably below the plasma potential, due to what
is termed a Debye_sheath. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes
their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of
quasineutrality, which says the density of negative charges is approximately
equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma
(neÂ =Â <Z>ni), but on the scale of the Debye_length there can be charge
imbalance. In the special case that double_layers are formed, the charge
separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.
The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means
other than simply finding the net charge_density. A common example is to assume
that the electrons satisfy the Boltzmann_relation:
          n  e   &#x221D;  e  e &#x03A6;  /   k  B    T  e     .
      {\displaystyle n_{\text{e}}\propto e^{e\Phi /k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{e}}}.}
      [{\displaystyle n_{\text{e}}\propto e^{e\Phi /k_{\text{B}}T_{\text
      {e}}}.}]
Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field
from the density:
          E  = &#x2212;     k  B    T  e    e      &#x2207;  n  e     n  e
      .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} =-{\frac {k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{e}}}{e}}
      {\frac {\nabla n_{\text{e}}}{n_{\text{e}}}}.}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf
      {E} =-{\frac {k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{e}}}{e}}{\frac {\nabla n_{\text{e}}}
      {n_{\text{e}}}}.}]
(The "downward pointing triangle" is a vector gradient; see nabla_symbol and
gradient for more information.)
It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam,
for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma
must generally be very low, or it must be very small. Otherwise, the repulsive
electrostatic_force dissipates it.
In astrophysical plasmas, Debye_screening prevents electric fields from
directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the
Debye_length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to
generate, and be affected by, magnetic_fields. This can and does cause
extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an
object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye_lengths. The dynamics of
plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are
studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.
Plasma is often called the fourth state_of_matter after solid, liquids and
gases.[18][19] It is distinct from these and other lower-energy states_of
matter. Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no
definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the
following:

***** Resistivity and conductivity of various materials[edit] *****
Main article: Electrical_resistivities_of_the_elements_(data_page)
    * A conductor such as a metal has high conductivity and a low resistivity.
    * An insulator like glass has low conductivity and a high resistivity.
    * The conductivity of a semiconductor is generally intermediate, but varies
      widely under different conditions, such as exposure of the material to
      electric fields or specific frequencies of light, and, most important,
      with temperature and composition of the semiconductor material.
The degree of doping in semiconductors makes a large difference in
conductivity. To a point, more doping leads to higher conductivity. The
conductivity of a solution of water is highly dependent on its concentration of
dissolved salts, and other chemical species that ionize in the solution.
Electrical conductivity of water samples is used as an indicator of how salt-
free, ion-free, or impurity-free the sample is; the purer the water, the lower
the conductivity (the higher the resistivity). Conductivity measurements in
water are often reported as specific conductance, relative to the conductivity
of pure water at 25Â Ã‚Â°C. An EC_meter is normally used to measure conductivity
in a solution. A rough summary is as follows:

The effective temperature coefficient varies with temperature and purity level
of the material. The 20Â Ã‚Â°C value is only an approximation when used at other
temperatures. For example, the coefficient becomes lower at higher temperatures
for copper, and the value 0.00427 is commonly specified at 0Â Ã‚Â°C.[42]
The extremely low resistivity (high conductivity) of silver is characteristic
of metals. George_Gamow tidily summed up the nature of the metals' dealings
with electrons in his popular science book One, Two, Three...Infinity (1947):
     The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact
     that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and
     often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a
     metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that
     travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a
     metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite
     ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus
     forming what we call an electric current.
More technically, the free_electron_model gives a basic description of electron
flow in metals.
Wood is widely regarded as an extremely good insulator, but its resistivity is
sensitively dependent on moisture content, with damp wood being a factor of at
least 1010 worse insulator than oven-dry.[37] In any case, a sufficiently high
voltage Ã¢Â€Â“ such as that in lightning strikes or some high-tension power lines
Ã¢Â€Â“ can lead to insulation breakdown and electrocution risk even with
apparently dry wood.
***** Temperature dependence[edit] *****
**** Linear approximation[edit] ****
The electrical resistivity of most materials changes with temperature. If the
temperature T does not vary too much, a linear_approximation is typically used:
         &#x03C1; ( T ) =  &#x03C1;  0   [ 1 + &#x03B1; ( T &#x2212;  T  0   )
      ]   {\displaystyle \rho (T)=\rho _{0}[1+\alpha (T-T_{0})]}  [\rho
      (T)=\rho _{0}[1+\alpha (T-T_{0})]]
where     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is called the
temperature coefficient of resistivity,      T  0     {\displaystyle T_{0}}
[T_{0}] is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and
&#x03C1;  0     {\displaystyle \rho _{0}}  [\rho _{0}] is the resistivity at
temperature      T  0     {\displaystyle T_{0}}  [T_{0}]. The parameter
&#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is an empirical parameter fitted
from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an
approximation,     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is different
for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify
the temperature that     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] was
measured at with a suffix, such as      &#x03B1;  15     {\displaystyle \alpha
_{15}}  [\alpha _{15}], and the relationship only holds in a range of
temperatures around the reference.[43] When the temperature varies over a large
temperature range, the linear_approximation is inadequate and a more detailed
analysis and understanding should be used.
**** Metals[edit] ****

Temperature dependence of the resistivity of gold, copper and silver.
In general, electrical resistivity of metals increases with temperature.
ElectronÃ¢Â€Â“phonon interactions can play a key role. At high temperatures, the
resistance of a metal increases linearly with temperature. As the temperature
of a metal is reduced, the temperature dependence of resistivity follows a
power law function of temperature. Mathematically the temperature dependence of
the resistivity ÃÂ of a metal is given by the BlochÃ¢Â€Â“GrÃƒÂ¼neisen formula:
         &#x03C1; ( T ) = &#x03C1; ( 0 ) + A   (   T  &#x0398;  R     )   n
      &#x222B;  0    &#x0398;  R    /  T      x  n    (  e  x   &#x2212; 1 )
      ( 1 &#x2212;  e  &#x2212; x   )     d x   {\displaystyle \rho (T)=\rho
      (0)+A\left({\frac {T}{\Theta _{R}}}\right)^{n}\int _{0}^{\Theta _{R}/T}
      {\frac {x^{n}}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})}}\,dx}  [{\displaystyle \rho (T)=\rho
      (0)+A\left({\frac {T}{\Theta _{R}}}\right)^{n}\int _{0}^{\Theta _{R}/T}
      {\frac {x^{n}}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})}}\,dx}]
where     &#x03C1; ( 0 )   {\displaystyle \rho (0)}  [\rho (0)] is the residual
resistivity due to defect scattering, A is a constant that depends on the
velocity of electrons at the Fermi_surface, the Debye_radius and the number
density of electrons in the metal.      &#x0398;  R     {\displaystyle \Theta _
{R}}  [\Theta _{R}] is the Debye_temperature as obtained from resistivity
measurements and matches very closely with the values of Debye temperature
obtained from specific heat measurements. n is an integer that depends upon the
nature of interaction:
    * nÂ =Â 5 implies that the resistance is due to scattering of electrons by
      phonons (as it is for simple metals)
    * nÂ =Â 3 implies that the resistance is due to s-d electron scattering (as
      is the case for transition metals)
    * nÂ =Â 2 implies that the resistance is due to electronÃ¢Â€Â“electron
      interaction.
If more than one source of scattering is simultaneously present, Matthiessen's
Rule (first formulated by Augustus_Matthiessen in the 1860s)[44][45] states
that the total resistance can be approximated by adding up several different
terms, each with the appropriate value ofÂ n.
As the temperature of the metal is sufficiently reduced (so as to 'freeze' all
the phonons), the resistivity usually reaches a constant value, known as the
residual resistivity. This value depends not only on the type of metal, but on
its purity and thermal history. The value of the residual resistivity of a
metal is decided by its impurity concentration. Some materials lose all
electrical resistivity at sufficiently low temperatures, due to an effect known
as superconductivity.
An investigation of the low-temperature resistivity of metals was the
motivation to Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes's experiments that led in 1911 to
discovery of superconductivity. For details see History_of_superconductivity.
**** Semiconductors[edit] ****
Main article: Semiconductor
In general, intrinsic_semiconductor resistivity decreases with increasing
temperature. The electrons are bumped to the conduction_energy_band by thermal
energy, where they flow freely, and in doing so leave behind holes in the
valence_band, which also flow freely. The electric resistance of a typical
intrinsic (non doped) semiconductor decreases exponentially with temperature:
         &#x03C1; =  &#x03C1;  0    e  &#x2212; a T      {\displaystyle \rho
      =\rho _{0}e^{-aT}\,}  [\rho =\rho _{0}e^{-aT}\,]
An even better approximation of the temperature dependence of the resistivity
of a semiconductor is given by the SteinhartÃ¢Â€Â“Hart_equation:
           1 T   = A + B ln &#x2061; &#x03C1; + C ( ln &#x2061; &#x03C1;  )  3
      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{T}}=A+B\ln \rho +C(\ln \rho )^{3}\,}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{T}}=A+B\ln \rho +C(\ln \rho )^{3}\,}]
where A, B and C are the so-called SteinhartÃ¢Â€Â“Hart coefficients.
This equation is used to calibrate thermistors.
Extrinsic_(doped)_semiconductors have a far more complicated temperature
profile. As temperature increases starting from absolute zero they first
decrease steeply in resistance as the carriers leave the donors or acceptors.
After most of the donors or acceptors have lost their carriers, the resistance
starts to increase again slightly due to the reducing mobility of carriers
(much as in a metal). At higher temperatures, they behave like intrinsic
semiconductors as the carriers from the donors/acceptors become insignificant
compared to the thermally generated carriers.[46]
In non-crystalline semiconductors, conduction can occur by charges quantum
tunnelling from one localised site to another. This is known as variable_range
hopping and has the characteristic form of
         &#x03C1; = A exp &#x2061;  (  T  &#x2212; 1  /  n   )  ,
      {\displaystyle \rho =A\exp \left(T^{-1/n}\right),}  [{\displaystyle \rho
      =A\exp \left(T^{-1/n}\right),}]
where n = 2, 3, 4, depending on the dimensionality of the system.
***** Complex resistivity and conductivity[edit] *****
When analyzing the response of materials to alternating electric fields
(dielectric_spectroscopy),[47] in applications such as electrical_impedance
tomography,[48] it is convenient to replace resistivity with a complex quantity
called impedivity (in analogy to electrical_impedance). Impedivity is the sum
of a real component, the resistivity, and an imaginary component, the
reactivity (in analogy to reactance). The magnitude of impedivity is the square
root of sum of squares of magnitudes of resistivity and reactivity.
Conversely, in such cases the conductivity must be expressed as a complex
number (or even as a matrix of complex numbers, in the case of anisotropic
materials) called the admittivity. Admittivity is the sum of a real component
called the conductivity and an imaginary component called the susceptivity.
An alternative description of the response to alternating currents uses a real
(but frequency-dependent) conductivity, along with a real permittivity. The
larger the conductivity is, the more quickly the alternating-current signal is
absorbed by the material (i.e., the more opaque the material is). For details,
see Mathematical_descriptions_of_opacity.
***** Resistance versus resistivity in complicated geometries[edit] *****
Even if the material's resistivity is known, calculating the resistance of
something made from it may, in some cases, be much more complicated than the
formula     R = &#x03C1; &#x2113;  /  A   {\displaystyle R=\rho \ell /A}
[R=\rho \ell /A] above. One example is spreading_resistance_profiling, where
the material is inhomogeneous (different resistivity in different places), and
the exact paths of current flow are not obvious.
In cases like this, the formulas
         J = &#x03C3; E   &#x21CC;   E = &#x03C1; J     {\displaystyle J=\sigma
      E\,\,\rightleftharpoons \,\,E=\rho J\,\!}  [J=\sigma
      E\,\,\rightleftharpoons \,\,E=\rho J\,\!]
must be replaced with
          J  (  r  ) = &#x03C3; (  r  )  E  (  r  )   &#x21CC;    E  (  r  ) =
      &#x03C1; (  r  )  J  (  r  ) ,     {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} (\mathbf
      {r} )=\sigma (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r}
      )\,\,\rightleftharpoons \,\,\mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} )=\rho (\mathbf {r}
      )\mathbf {J} (\mathbf {r} ),\,\!}  [\mathbf {J} (\mathbf {r} )=\sigma
      (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} )\,\,\rightleftharpoons
      \,\,\mathbf {E} (\mathbf {r} )=\rho (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {J} (\mathbf
      {r} ),\,\!]
where E and J are now vector_fields. This equation, along with the continuity
equation for J and the Poisson's_equation for E, form a set of partial
differential_equations. In special cases, an exact or approximate solution to
these equations can be worked out by hand, but for very accurate answers in
complex cases, computer methods like finite_element_analysis may be required.
***** Resistivity-density product[edit] *****
In some applications where the weight of an item is very important, the product
of resistivity and density is more important than absolute low resistivity Ã¢Â€Â“
it is often possible to make the conductor thicker to make up for a higher
resistivity; and then a low-resistivity-density-product material (or
equivalently a high conductivity-to-density ratio) is desirable. For example,
for long-distance overhead_power_lines, aluminium is frequently used rather
than copper (Cu) because it is lighter for the same conductance.
Silver, although it is the least resistive metal known, has a high density and
performs similarly to copper by this measure, but is much more expensive.
Calcium and the alkali metals have the best resistivity-density products, but
are rarely used for conductors due to their high reactivity with water and
oxygen (and lack of physical strength). Aluminium is far more stable. Toxicity
excludes the choice of beryllium.[49] (Pure beryllium is also brittle.) Thus,
aluminium is usually the metal of choice when the weight or cost of a conductor
is the driving consideration.
