In nuclear_physics, secular equilibrium is a situation in which the quantity of
a radioactive isotope remains constant because its production rate (e.g., due
to decay of a parent isotope) is equal to its decay rate.
***** Secular equilibrium in radioactive decay[edit] *****
Secular equilibrium can only occur in a radioactive decay chain if the half-
life of the daughter radionuclide B is much shorter than the half-life of the
parent radionuclide A. In such a situation, the decay rate of A, and hence the
production rate of B, is approximately constant, because the half-life of A is
very long compared to the timescales being considered. The quantity of
radionuclide B builds up until the number of B atoms decaying per unit time
becomes equal to the number being produced per unit time; the quantity of
radionuclide B then reaches a constant, equilibrium value. Assuming the initial
concentration of radionuclide B is zero, full equilibrium usually takes several
half-lives of radionuclide B to establish.
The quantity of radionuclide B when secular equilibrium is reached is
determined by the quantity of its parent A and the half-lives of the two
radionuclide. This can be seen from the time rate of change of the number of
atoms of radionuclide B:
            d  N  B     d t    =  &#x03BB;  A    N  A   &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  B
      N  B   ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {dN_{B}}{dt}}=\lambda _{A}N_{A}-\lambda
      _{B}N_{B},}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {dN_{B}}{dt}}=\lambda _{A}N_{A}-
      \lambda _{B}N_{B},}]
where Î»A and Î»B are the decay_constants of radionuclide A and B, related to
their half-lives t1/2 by     &#x03BB; = ln &#x2061; ( 2 )  /   t  1  /  2
{\displaystyle \lambda =\ln(2)/t_{1/2}}  [{\displaystyle \lambda =\ln(2)/t_{1/
2}}], and NA and NB are the number of atoms of A and B at a given time.
Secular equilibrium occurs when     d  N  B    /  d t = 0   {\displaystyle dN_
{B}/dt=0}  [dN_{B}/dt=0], or
          N  B   =    &#x03BB;  A    &#x03BB;  B      N  A   .   {\displaystyle
      N_{B}={\frac {\lambda _{A}}{\lambda _{B}}}N_{A}.}  [{\displaystyle N_{B}=
      {\frac {\lambda _{A}}{\lambda _{B}}}N_{A}.}]
Over long enough times, comparable to the half-life of radionuclide A, the
secular equilibrium is only approximate; NA decays away according to
          N  A   ( t ) =  N  A   ( 0 )  e  &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  A   t   ,
      {\displaystyle N_{A}(t)=N_{A}(0)e^{-\lambda _{A}t},}  [{\displaystyle N_
      {A}(t)=N_{A}(0)e^{-\lambda _{A}t},}]
' and the "equilibrium" quantity of radionuclide B declines in turn. For times
short compared to the half-life of A,      &#x03BB;  A   t &#x226A; 1
{\displaystyle \lambda _{A}t\ll 1}  [\lambda _{A}t\ll 1] and the exponential
can be approximated as 1.
