Magnetic field that extends from the Earthâs inner core to where it meets the
solar wind
Computer simulation of the Earth's field in a period of normal polarity between
reversals.[1] The lines represent magnetic field lines, blue when the field
points towards the center and yellow when away. The rotation axis of the Earth
is centered and vertical. The dense clusters of lines are within the Earth's
core.[2]
Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic
field that extends from the Earth's_interior out into space, where it interacts
with the solar_wind, a stream of charged_particles emanating from the Sun. The
magnetic field is generated by electric_currents due to the motion of
convection_currents of molten iron in the Earth's_outer_core: these convection
currents are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a
geodynamo. The magnitude of the Earth's magnetic field at its surface ranges
from 25 to 65 microteslas (0.25 to 0.65 gauss).[3] As an approximation, it is
represented by a field of a magnetic_dipole currently tilted at an angle of
about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's_rotational_axis, as if there were a
bar_magnet placed at that angle at the center of the Earth. The North
geomagnetic_pole, currently located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere,
is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and conversely.
While the North and South magnetic_poles are usually located near the
geographic poles, they slowly and continuously move over geological time
scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for
navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand
years, the_Earth's_field_reverses and the North and South_Magnetic_Poles
respectively, abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geomagnetic_poles
leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating
geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying
the motions of continents and ocean floors in the process of plate_tectonics.
The magnetosphere is the region above the ionosphere that is defined by the
extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of
thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from the charged
particles of the solar_wind and cosmic_rays that would otherwise strip away the
upper atmosphere, including the ozone_layer that protects the Earth from
harmful_ultraviolet_radiation.

***** Significance[edit] *****
The Earth's magnetic field serves to deflect most of the solar wind, whose
charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the
Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.[4] One stripping mechanism is for gas
to be caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.
[5] Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars,
resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the
dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of_its
atmosphere.[6][7]
The study of past magnetic field of the Earth is known as paleomagnetism.[8]
The polarity of the Earth's magnetic field is recorded in igneous_rocks, and
reversals_of_the_field are thus detectable as "stripes" centered on mid-ocean
ridges where the sea_floor is spreading, while the stability of the geomagnetic
poles between reversals has allowed paleomagnetists to track the past motion of
continents. Reversals also provide the basis for magnetostratigraphy, a way of
dating rocks and sediments.[9] The field also magnetizes the crust, and
magnetic_anomalies can be used to search for deposits of metal ores.[10]
Humans have used compasses for direction finding since the 11th century A.D.
and for navigation since the 12th century.[11] Although the magnetic
declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple
compass remains useful for navigation. Using magnetoreception various other
organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's
magnetic field for orientation and navigation.
***** Characteristics[edit] *****
**** Description[edit] ****
At any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-
dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a
compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to
true North is the declination (D) or variation. Facing magnetic North, the
angle the field makes with the horizontal is the inclination (I) or magnetic
dip. The intensity (F) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a
magnet. Another common representation is in X (North), Y (East) and Z (Down)
coordinates.[12]
Common coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field.
*** Intensity[edit] ***
The intensity of the field is often measured in gauss_(G), but is generally
reported in nanoteslas (nT), with 1 G = 100,000 nT. A nanotesla is also
referred to as a gamma (Î³).[13] The tesla is the SI unit of the magnetic
field, B. The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000 nT
(0.25â0.65 G). By comparison, a strong refrigerator_magnet has a field of
about 10,000,000 nanoteslas (100 G).[14]
A map of intensity contours is called an isodynamic chart. As the World
Magnetic_Model shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the
equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the South_Atlantic_Anomaly over South
America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of
Antarctica south of Australia.[15]
*** Inclination[edit] ***
Main article: Magnetic_dip
The inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90Â° (up)
to 90Â° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is
straight down at the North_Magnetic_Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude
decreases until it is horizontal (0Â°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to
rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination
can be measured with a dip_circle.
An isoclinic chart (map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field
is shown below.
*** Declination[edit] ***
Main article: Magnetic_declination
Declination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true
north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a
compass with the direction of a celestial_pole. Maps typically include
information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the
relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination
for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines
with each line representing a fixed declination).

See also: Dipole_model_of_the_Earth's_magnetic_field
Near the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated
by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and
tilted at an angle of about 11Â° with respect to the rotational axis of the
Earth.[13] The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its
south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.[16] This may seem
surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to
rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the
north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the
north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The
dipolar field accounts for 80â90% of the field in most locations.[12]
**** Magnetic poles[edit] ****
Main article: Geomagnetic_pole
The movement of Earth's North Magnetic Pole across the Canadian arctic.
Historically, the north and south poles of a magnet were first defined by the
Earth's magnetic field, not vice versa, since one of the first uses for a
magnet was as a compass needle. A magnet's North pole is defined as the pole
that is attracted by the Earth's North Magnetic Pole when the magnet is
suspended so it can turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North
Magnetic Pole of the Earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field (the
place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).[17][18][19][20]
The positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways:
locally or globally.[21] The local definition is the point where the magnetic
field is vertical.[22] This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The
inclination of the Earth's field is 90Â° (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole
and -90Â° (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander
independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the
globe. Movements of up to 40 kilometres (25 mi) per year have been observed for
the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has
been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia_Peninsula in
1831 to 600 kilometres (370 mi) from Resolute_Bay in 2001.[23] The magnetic
equator is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is
horizontal).
The global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If
a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the
best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's
surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's
magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip
poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the
Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not
coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.

6) Southern tail lobe. 7) Plasmasphere.
Main article: Magnetosphere
Earth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted
further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving
the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000 kilometres per
second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary_magnetic
field (IMF).[24]
The solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it
would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's
magnetic field. The magnetopause, the area where the pressures balance, is the
boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is
asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10 Earth_radii out but the other
side stretching out in a magnetotail that extends beyond 200 Earth radii.[25]
Sunward of the magnetopause is the bow_shock, the area where the solar wind
slows abruptly.[24]
Inside the magnetosphere is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing
low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region begins at a height of
60 km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This
region rotates with the Earth.[25] There are also two concentric tire-shaped
regions, called the Van_Allen_radiation_belts, with high-energy ions (energies
from 0.1 to 10 million electron_volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1â2 Earth
radii out while the outer belt is at 4â7 Earth radii. The plasmasphere and
Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying
greatly with solar activity.[26]
As well as deflecting the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects
cosmic_rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the
Solar_System. Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar System by the Sun's
magnetosphere, or heliosphere.[27]) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk
exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a
particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.
[24]
Some of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral
around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per
second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions
drift eastward, giving rise to a ring_current. This current reduces the
magnetic field at the Earth's surface.[24] Particles that penetrate the
ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the
aurorae and also emit X-rays.[25]
The varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as space_weather, are
largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere
expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it
gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic_storms,
can occur when a coronal_mass_ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock
wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the
Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; the_"Halloween"_storm
of_2003 damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented
storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out
telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.[24][28]
***** Time dependence[edit] *****
**** Short-term variations[edit] ****
Background: a set of traces from magnetic observatories showing a magnetic
storm in 2000.
Globe: map showing locations of observatories and contour lines giving
horizontal magnetic intensity in Î¼ T.
The geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of
years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere
(ionospheric_dynamo_region) and magnetosphere, and some changes can be traced
to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales
of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's_interior, particularly
the iron-rich core.[12]
Frequently, the Earth's magnetosphere is hit by solar_flares causing
geomagnetic storms, provoking displays of aurorae. The short-term instability
of the magnetic field is measured with the K-index.[29]
Data from THEMIS show that the magnetic field, which interacts with the solar
wind, is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between Sun and Earth
â opposite to the previous hypothesis. During forthcoming solar storms, this
could result in blackouts and disruptions in artificial_satellites.[30]
**** Secular variation[edit] ****
Main article: Geomagnetic_secular_variation
Estimated declination contours by year, 1590 to 1990 (click to see variation).
Strength of the axial dipole component of Earth's magnetic field from 1600 to
2020.
Changes in Earth's magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are
referred to as secular variation. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination
is observed to vary over tens of degrees.[12] The animation shows how global
declinations have changed over the last few centuries.[31]
The direction and intensity of the dipole change over time. Over the last two
centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per
century.[12] At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about
1600 years.[32] However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand
years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.[33]
A prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a
westward drift at a rate of about 0.2 degrees per year.[32] This drift is not
the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has
been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400
AD.[34]
Changes that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and
geological materials. Such changes are referred to as paleomagnetic secular
variation or paleosecular variation (PSV). The records typically include long
periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic
excursions and reversals.[35]
**** Magnetic field reversals[edit] ****
Geomagnetic polarity during the late Cenozoic_Era. Dark areas denote periods
where the polarity matches today's polarity, light areas denote periods where
that polarity is reversed.
Main article: Geomagnetic_reversal
Although generally Earth's field is approximately dipolar, with an axis that is
nearly aligned with the rotational axis, occasionally the North and South
geomagnetic_poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals can be
found in basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor
magnetic anomalies.[36] Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals
between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50
million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the
BrunhesâMatuyama_reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago.[23][37] A
related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal,
with no change in polarity.[38][39] The Laschamp_event is an example of an
excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).
The past magnetic field is recorded mostly by strongly_magnetic_minerals,
particularly iron_oxides such as magnetite, that can carry a permanent magnetic
moment. This remanent_magnetization, or remanence, can be acquired in more than
one way. In lava_flows, the direction of the field is "frozen" in small
minerals as they cool, giving rise to a thermoremanent_magnetization. In
sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards
the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This
is called detrital remanent magnetization.[8]
Thermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies
around mid-ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the
mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is
carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the
direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt
records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are
symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the
ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This
provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.[8]
Radiometric_dating of lava flows has been used to establish a geomagnetic
polarity time scale, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis
of magnetostratigraphy, a geophysical correlation technique that can be used to
date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic
anomalies.[8]
Studies of lava flows on Steens_Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the magnetic
field could have shifted at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day at some time in
Earth's history, which significantly challenges the popular understanding of
how the Earth's magnetic field works.[40] This finding was later attributed to
unusual rock magnetic properties of the lava flow under study, not rapid field
change, by one of the original authors of the 1995 study.[41]
Temporary dipole tilt variations that take the dipole axis across the equator
and then back to the original polarity are known as excursions.[39]
**** Earliest appearance[edit] ****
Paleomagnetic studies of Paleoarchean lava in Australia and conglomerate in
South Africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at
least about 3,450 million years ago.[42][43][44]
**** Future[edit] ****
Variations in virtual axial dipole moment since the last reversal.
At present, the overall geomagnetic field is becoming weaker; the present
strong deterioration corresponds to a 10â15% decline over the last 150 years
and has accelerated in the past several years; geomagnetic intensity has
declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved
approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength
are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past
magnetic fields recorded in rocks.
The nature of Earth's magnetic field is one of heteroscedastic fluctuation. An
instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span
of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in
the field strength. It has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons.
Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is
insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not
strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish
even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.
The Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting from northern Canada towards
Siberia with a presently accelerating rateâ10 kilometres (6.2 mi) per year at
the beginning of the 20th century, up to 40 kilometres (25 mi) per year in
2003,[23] and since then has only accelerated.[45]
***** Physical origin[edit] *****
Main article: Dynamo_theory
**** Earth's core and the geodynamo[edit] ****
The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in
the conductive iron alloys of its core, created by convection currents due to
heat escaping from the core. However the process is complex, and computer
models that reproduce some of its features have only been developed in the last
few decades.
A schematic illustrating the relationship between motion of conducting fluid,
organized into rolls by the Coriolis force, and the magnetic field the motion
generates.[46]
The Earth and most of the planets in the Solar System, as well as the Sun and
other stars, all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically
conducting fluids.[47] The Earth's field originates in its core. This is a
region of iron alloys extending to about 3400 km (the radius of the Earth is
6370 km). It is divided into a solid inner_core, with a radius of 1220 km, and
a liquid outer_core.[48] The motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven
by heat flow from the inner core, which is about 6,000 K (5,730 Â°C;
10,340 Â°F), to the core-mantle_boundary, which is about 3,800 K (3,530 Â°C;
6,380 Â°F).[49] The heat is generated by potential energy released by heavier
materials sinking toward the core (planetary_differentiation, the iron
catastrophe) as well as decay of radioactive elements in the interior. The
pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the Earth and the presence of
the solid inner core.[50]
The mechanism by which the Earth generates a magnetic field is known as a
dynamo.[47] The magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop: current loops
generate magnetic fields (AmpÃ¨re's_circuital_law); a changing magnetic field
generates an electric field (Faraday's_law); and the electric and magnetic
fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents (the Lorentz
force).[51] These effects can be combined in a partial_differential_equation
for the magnetic field called the magnetic induction equation,
            &#x2202;  B    &#x2202; t    = &#x03B7;  &#x2207;  2    B  +
      &#x2207; &#x00D7; (  u  &#x00D7;  B  ) ,   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}=\eta \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {B} +\nabla
      \times (\mathbf {u} \times \mathbf {B} ),}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}=\eta \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {B} +\nabla
      \times (\mathbf {u} \times \mathbf {B} ),}]
where u is the velocity of the fluid; B is the magnetic B-field; and Î·=1/ÏÎ¼
is the magnetic_diffusivity, which is inversely proportional to the product of
the electrical_conductivity Ï and the permeability Î¼ .[52] The term âB/ât
is the time derivative of the field; â2 is the Laplace_operator and âÃ is
the curl_operator.
The first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a diffusion
term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations
of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would
disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.[52]
In a perfect conductor (    &#x03C3; = &#x221E;    {\displaystyle \sigma
=\infty \;}  [{\displaystyle \sigma =\infty \;}]), there would be no diffusion.
By Lenz's_law, any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by
currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the
fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this
effect is called the frozen-in-field theorem. Even in a fluid with a finite
conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid
moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field
indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it
resists fluid motion.[52]
The motion of the fluid is sustained by convection, motion driven by buoyancy.
The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher
temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced
by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies
and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left
behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional
convection. A Coriolis_effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends
to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.[50]
[52]
A dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a "seed" field to get it
started.[52] For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field.
Early in its history the Sun went through a T-Tauri_phase in which the solar
wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the
present solar wind.[53] However, much of the field may have been screened out
by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle
boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric
conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the
boundary conditions for the geodynamo.[54]
The average magnetic field in the Earth's outer core was calculated to be 25
gausses, 50 times stronger than the field at the surface.[55]
**** Numerical models[edit] ****
Simulating the geodynamo requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear
partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the
Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of
points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of
the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were
confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion
is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic
dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and
testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.[56]
The first self-consistent dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid
motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in
Japan[57] and one in the United States.[1][58] The latter received attention
because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth's
field, including geomagnetic reversals.[56]
**** Currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere[edit] ****
Electric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields
(ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where the
atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect
surface magnetic fields by as much as one degree. Typical daily variations of
field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations
over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).[59]
***** Measurement and analysis[edit] *****
**** Detection[edit] ****
The Earth's magnetic field strength was measured by Carl_Friedrich_Gauss in
1832[60] and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay
of about 10% over the last 150 years.[61] The Magsat satellite and later
satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of
the Earth's magnetic field. The later Ãrsted_satellite allowed a comparison
indicating a dynamic geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an
alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of South Africa.[62]
Governments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the
Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic_observatories, typically part of
a national Geological_survey, for example the British_Geological_Survey's
Eskdalemuir_Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic
conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications,
electric power, and other human activities.
The International_Real-time_Magnetic_Observatory_Network, with over 100
interlinked geomagnetic observatories around the world, has been recording the
Earth's magnetic field since 1991.
The military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to
detect anomalies in the natural background that might be caused by a
significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these
magnetic_anomaly_detectors are flown in aircraft like the UK's Nimrod or towed
as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.
Commercially, geophysical prospecting companies also use magnetic detectors to
identify naturally occurring anomalies from ore bodies, such as the Kursk
Magnetic_Anomaly.
**** Crustal magnetic anomalies[edit] ****
A model of short-wavelength features of Earth's magnetic field, attributed to
lithospheric anomalies[63]
Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by
iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and
middens in archaeological_geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from
airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect
submarines,[64] the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been
mapped. Basalt â the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor[65]
â contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort
compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early
as the late 18th century.[66] More important, because the presence of magnetite
gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have
provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock
cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.[66]
**** Statistical models[edit] ****
Each measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time. If an
accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the
measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make
predictions.
*** Spherical harmonics[edit] ***
See also: Multipole_expansion
Schematic representation of spherical harmonics on a sphere and their nodal
lines. Pâ m is equal to 0 along m great_circles passing through the poles,
and along â-m circles of equal latitude. The function changes sign each
âtime it crosses one of these lines.
Example of a quadrupole field. This can also be constructed by moving two
dipoles together.
The most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic
field is to fit the measurements to a set of spherical_harmonics. This was
first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.[67] Spherical harmonics are functions that
oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions,
one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is
zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South
Poles; the number of such nodal_lines is the absolute value of the order m. The
function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the
order is equal to the degree â. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular
arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A monopole is an
isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A dipole is equivalent
to two opposing charges brought close together and a quadrupole to two dipoles
brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.
[12]
Spherical harmonics can represent any scalar_field (function of position) that
satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a vector_field, but if it is
expressed in Cartesian components X, Y, Z, each component is the derivative of
the same scalar function called the magnetic_potential. Analyses of the Earth's
magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that
differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field
measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each
multiplied by the best-fitting Gauss coefficient gmâ or hmâ.[12]
The lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, g00, gives the contribution of an isolated
magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients â g10, g11, and
h11 â determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The
best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10Â° with respect to the
rotational axis, as described earlier.[12]
*** Radial dependence[edit] ***
Spherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external
sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example,
ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient
gmâ or hmâ can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as
1/râ+1 and one that increases with radius as râ. The increasing terms fit
the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However,
averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.[12]
The remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source (â=1) drops
off as 1/r2. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off
as 1/r3. Quadrupole terms drop off as 1/r4, and higher order terms drop off
increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about
half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is
fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8
at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only
the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a
variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree 14 or
less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about 2,000
kilometres (1,200 mi) or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal
anomalies.[12]
*** Global models[edit] ***
The International_Association_of_Geomagnetism_and_Aeronomy maintains a standard
global field model called the International_Geomagnetic_Reference_Field. It is
updated every five years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed
using data from satellites (Ãrsted, CHAMP and SAC-C) and a world network of
geomagnetic observatories.[68] The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated
at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are
truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).[69]
Another global field model, called the World_Magnetic_Model, is produced
jointly by the United States National_Centers_for_Environmental_Information
(formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and the British_Geological
Survey. This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an
approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the
United_States_Department_of_Defense, the Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom),
the United States Federal_Aviation_Administration (FAA), the North_Atlantic
Treaty_Organization (NATO), and the International_Hydrographic_Office as well
as in many civilian navigation systems.[70]
A third model, produced by the Goddard_Space_Flight_Center (NASA and GSFC) and
the Danish_Space_Research_Institute, uses a "comprehensive modeling" approach
that attempts to reconcile data with greatly varying temporal and spatial
resolution from ground and satellite sources.[71]
For users with higher accuracy needs, the United States National_Centers_for
Environmental_Information developed the Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM), which
extends to degree and order 790 and resolves magnetic anomalies down to a
wavelength of 56 kilometers. It was compiled from satellite, marine,
aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys. As of 2018[update], the latest
version, EMM2017, includes data from The European Space Agency's Swarm
satellite mission.[72]
***** Biomagnetism[edit] *****
Main article: Magnetoreception
Animals including birds and turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, and
use the field to navigate during migration.[73] Some researchers have found
that cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing,
but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that
magnetism is responsible.[74][75] Other researchers reported in 2011 that they
could not replicate those findings using different Google_Earth images.[76]
Researchers found out that very weak electromagnetic fields disrupt the
magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using
the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals are to
blame for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds;[77] instead, the
culprits have frequencies between 2 kHz and 5 MHz. These include AM radio
signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or
private homes.[78]
