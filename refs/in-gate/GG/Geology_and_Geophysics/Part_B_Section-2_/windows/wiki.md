Microsoft Windows is a group of several graphical operating_system families,
all of which are developed, marketed and sold by Microsoft. Each family caters
to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active Microsoft Windows
families include Windows_NT and Windows_IoT; these may encompass subfamilies,
e.g. Windows_Server or Windows_Embedded_Compact (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft
Windows families include Windows_9x, Windows_Mobile and Windows_Phone.
Microsoft introduced an operating_environment named Windows on November 20,
1985, as a graphical operating_system_shell for MS-DOS in response to the
growing interest in graphical_user_interfaces (GUIs).[3] Microsoft Windows came
to dominate the world's personal_computer (PC) market with over_90%_market
share, overtaking Mac_OS, which had been introduced in 1984. Apple came to see
Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as
implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in
court in Microsoft's favor in 1993). On PCs, Windows is still the most popular
operating system. However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of
the overall operating system market to Android,[4] because of the massive
growth in sales of Android smartphones. In 2014, the number of Windows devices
sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold. This comparison however
may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems traditionally target
different platforms. Still, numbers for server use of Windows (that are
comparable to competitors) show one third market share, similar to that for end
user use.
As of October 2018[update], the most recent version of Windows for PCs,
tablets, smartphones and embedded_devices is Windows_10. The most recent
version for server_computers is Windows_Server, version 1903.[5] A_specialized
version_of_Windows also runs on the Xbox_One video_game_console.[6]

**** By marketing role ****
Microsoft, the developer of Windows, has registered several trademarks, each of
which denote a family of Windows operating systems that target a specific
sector of the computing industry. As of 2014, the following Windows families
are being actively developed:
    * Windows_NT: Started as a family of operating systems with Windows_NT_3.1,
      an operating system for server_computers and workstations. It now
      consists of three operating system subfamilies that are released almost
      at the same time and share the same kernel:
          o Windows: The operating system for mainstream personal_computers,
            tablets and smartphones. The latest version is Windows_10. The main
            competitor of this family is macOS by Apple for personal computers
            and Android for mobile devices (c.f. Usage_share_of_operating
            systems_Â§ Market_share_by_category).
          o Windows_Server: The operating system for server computers. The
            latest version is Windows_Server_2019. Unlike its client sibling,
            it has adopted a strong naming scheme. The main competitor of this
            family is Linux. (c.f. Usage_share_of_operating_systems_Â§ Market
            share_by_category)
          o Windows_PE: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to
            operate as a live_operating_system, used for installing Windows on
            bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once),
            recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows
            PE 10.
    * Windows_IoT (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed
      Windows_CE as a general-purpose operating system for every device that
      was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer.
      Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and
      was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of Windows
      Embedded_Industry, Windows Embedded Professional, Windows_Embedded
      Standard, Windows_Embedded_Handheld and Windows_Embedded_Automotive.[7]
The following Windows families are no longer being developed:
    * Windows_9x: An operating system that targeted consumers market.
      Discontinued because of suboptimal performance. (PC_World called its last
      version, Windows_Me, one of the worst products of all time.)[8] Microsoft
      now caters to the consumer market with Windows NT.
    * Windows_Mobile: The predecessor to Windows Phone, it was a mobile phone
      operating system. The first version was called Pocket_PC_2000; the third
      version, Windows_Mobile_2003 is the first version to adopt the Windows
      Mobile trademark. The last version is Windows_Mobile_6.5.
    * Windows_Phone: An operating system sold only to manufacturers of
      smartphones. The first version was Windows_Phone_7, followed by Windows
      Phone_8, and the last version Windows_Phone_8.1. It was succeeded by
      Windows_10_Mobile.
***** Version history *****
Main article: History_of_Microsoft_Windows
See also: List_of_Microsoft_Windows_versions
The term Windows collectively describes any or all of several generations of
Microsoft operating_system products. These products are generally categorized
as follows:
**** Early versions ****
Main articles: Windows_1.0, Windows_2.0, and Windows_2.1x
Windows_1.0, the first version, released in 1985
The history of Windows dates back to 1981, when Microsoft started work on a
program called "Interface Manager". It was announced in November 1983 (after
the Apple_Lisa, but before the Macintosh) under the name "Windows", but Windows
1.0 was not released until November 1985.[9] Windows 1.0 was to compete with
Apple's operating system, but achieved little popularity. Windows 1.0 is not a
complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS. The shell of Windows 1.0
is a program known as the MS-DOS_Executive. Components included Calculator,
Calendar, Cardfile, Clipboard_viewer, Clock, Control_Panel, Notepad, Paint,
Reversi, Terminal and Write. Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows.
Instead all windows are tiled. Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other
windows. Microsoft sold as included Windows Development libraries with the C
development environment, which included numerous windows samples.[10]
Windows_2.0 was released in December 1987, and was more popular than its
predecessor. It features several improvements to the user interface and memory
management.[11] Windows 2.03 changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping
windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against
Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights.[12][13] Windows 2.0 also
introduced more sophisticated keyboard_shortcuts and could make use of expanded
memory.
Windows 2.1 was released in two different versions: Windows/286 and Windows/
386. Windows/386 uses the virtual_8086_mode of the Intel_80386 to multitask
several DOS programs and the paged_memory_model to emulate expanded memory
using available extended_memory. Windows/286, in spite of its name, runs on
both Intel_8086 and Intel_80286 processors. It runs in real_mode but can make
use of the high_memory_area.[citation_needed]
In addition to full Windows-packages, there were runtime-only versions that
shipped with early Windows software from third parties and made it possible to
run their Windows software on MS-DOS and without the full Windows feature set.
The early versions of Windows are often thought of as graphical shells, mostly
because they ran on top of MS-DOS and use it for file_system services.[14]
However, even the earliest Windows versions already assumed many typical
operating system functions; notably, having their own executable_file_format
and providing their own device_drivers (timer, graphics, printer, mouse,
keyboard and sound). Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute multiple
graphical applications at the same time, through cooperative_multitasking.
Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory
scheme, which allows it to run applications larger than available memory: code
segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became
scarce; data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished
processor control.
**** Windows 3.x ****
Main articles: Windows_3.0 and Windows_3.1x
Windows_3.0, released in 1990
Windows_3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual
memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share
arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications.[citation_needed]
Windows 3.0 applications can run in protected_mode, which gives them access to
several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the
software virtual memory scheme. They run inside the same address space, where
the segmented memory provides a degree of protection. Windows 3.0 also featured
improvements to the user interface. Microsoft rewrote critical operations from
C into assembly. Windows 3.0 is the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve
broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.[15]
[16]
Windows 3.1, made generally_available on March 1, 1992, featured a facelift. In
August 1993, Windows for Workgroups, a special version with integrated peer-to-
peer_networking features and a version number of 3.11, was released. It was
sold along with Windows 3.1. Support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31,
2001.[17]
Windows 3.2, released 1994, is an updated version of the Chinese version of
Windows 3.1.[18] The update was limited to this language version, as it fixed
only issues related to the complex writing system of the Chinese language.[19]
Windows 3.2 was generally sold by computer manufacturers with a ten-disk
version of MS-DOS that also had Simplified Chinese characters in basic output
and some translated utilities.
**** Windows 9x ****
Main article: Windows_9x
The next major consumer-oriented release of Windows, Windows_95, was released
on August 24, 1995. While still remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced
support for native 32-bit_applications, plug_and_play hardware, preemptive
multitasking, long_file_names of up to 255 characters, and provided increased
stability over its predecessors. Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned,
object_oriented user interface, replacing the previous Program_Manager with the
Start_menu, taskbar, and Windows_Explorer shell. Windows 95 was a major
commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of CNET remarked that "by the time
Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture
on computer desktops around the world."[20] Microsoft published four OEM
Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95, each of which was roughly equivalent to a
service_pack. The first OSR of Windows 95 was also the first version of Windows
to be bundled with Microsoft's web_browser, Internet_Explorer.[21] Mainstream
support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000, and extended support for
Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.[22]
Windows 95 was followed up with the release of Windows_98 on June 25, 1998,
which introduced the Windows_Driver_Model, support for USB_composite_devices,
support for ACPI, hibernation, and support for multi-monitor configurations.
Windows 98 also included integration with Internet_Explorer_4 through Active
Desktop and other aspects of the Windows_Desktop_Update (a series of
enhancements to the Explorer shell which were also made available for Windows
95). In May 1999, Microsoft released Windows_98_Second_Edition, an updated
version of Windows 98. Windows 98 SE added Internet_Explorer_5.0 and Windows
Media_Player 6.2 amongst other upgrades. Mainstream support for Windows 98
ended on June 30, 2002, and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11,
2006.[23]
On September 14, 2000, Microsoft released Windows_Me (Millennium Edition), the
last DOS-based version of Windows. Windows Me incorporated visual interface
enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows_2000, had faster
boot times than previous versions (which however, required the removal of the
ability to access a real_mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some
older programs),[24] expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media
Player 7, Windows_Movie_Maker, and the Windows_Image_Acquisition framework for
retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system
utilities such as System_File_Protection and System_Restore, and updated home
networking tools.[25] However, Windows Me was faced with criticism for its
speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal
of real mode DOS support. PC_World considered Windows Me to be one of the worst
operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product
of all time.[8]
**** Windows NT ****
Main article: Windows_NT
*** Early versions ***
In November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included
former Digital_Equipment_Corporation developers Dave_Cutler and Mark_Lucovsky)
began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system
known as "NT OS/2". NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating
system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive
multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures. However,
following the successful release of Windows_3.0, the NT development team
decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows_API
known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure
to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported
to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT
kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on
what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM
objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.
[26][27]
The first release of the resulting operating system, Windows_NT_3.1 (named to
associate it with Windows_3.1) was released in July 1993, with versions for
desktop workstations and servers. Windows_NT_3.5 was released in September
1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for Novell's NetWare,
and was followed up by Windows_NT_3.51 in May 1995, which included additional
improvements and support for the PowerPC architecture. Windows_NT_4.0 was
released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of Windows_95 to
the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released Windows_2000, a
successor to NT 4.0. The Windows NT name was dropped at this point in order to
put a greater focus on the Windows brand.[27]
*** Windows XP ***
Main article: Windows_XP
The next major version of Windows NT, Windows_XP, was released on October 25,
2001. The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer-oriented
Windows_9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change
which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based
predecessors. Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface
(including an updated Start menu and a "task-oriented" Windows_Explorer),
streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet_Explorer_6,
integration with Microsoft's .NET_Passport services, modes to help provide
compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and
Remote_Assistance functionality.[28]
At retail, Windows XP was now marketed in two main editions: the "Home" edition
was targeted towards consumers, while the "Professional" edition was targeted
towards business environments and power_users, and included additional security
and networking features. Home and Professional were later accompanied by the
"Media Center" edition (designed for home_theater_PCs, with an emphasis on
support for DVD playback, TV_tuner_cards, DVR functionality, and remote
controls), and the "Tablet PC" edition (designed for mobile devices meeting its
specifications for a tablet_computer, with support for stylus pen input and
additional pen-enabled applications).[29][30][31] Mainstream support for
Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009. Extended support ended on April 8, 2014.
[32]
After Windows 2000, Microsoft also changed its release schedules for server
operating systems; the server counterpart of Windows XP, Windows_Server_2003,
was released in April 2003.[27] It was followed in December 2005, by Windows
Server 2003 R2.
*** Windows Vista ***
Main article: Windows_Vista
After a lengthy development_process, Windows_Vista was released on November 30,
2006, for volume licensing and January 30, 2007, for consumers. It contained a
number of new_features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to
significant technical_changes, with a particular focus on security_features. It
was available in a number of different_editions, and has been subject to some
criticism, such as drop of performance, longer boot time, criticism of new UAC,
and stricter license agreement. Vista's server counterpart, Windows_Server_2008
was released in early 2008.
*** Windows 7 ***
Main article: Windows_7
On July 22, 2009, Windows_7 and Windows_Server_2008_R2 were released as RTM
(release to manufacturing) while the former was released to the public 3 months
later on October 22, 2009. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which
introduced a large number of new_features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more
focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being
compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already
compatible.[33] Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows_shell
with an updated taskbar, a home networking system called HomeGroup,[34] and
performance improvements.
*** Windows 8 and 8.1 ***
Main articles: Windows_8 and Windows_8.1
Windows_8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26,
2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the
introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's Metro_design_language
with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs.
These changes include the Start_screen, which uses large tiles that are more
convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually
updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for
use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with
cloud_services and other online platforms (such as social_networks and
Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox_Live services), the
Windows_Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as
Windows_RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM_architecture.[35][36][37]
[38][39][40] An update to Windows 8, called Windows_8.1,[41] was released on
October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper
OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows_8 and Windows_8.1 have
been subject to some criticism, such as removal of the Start_menu.
*** Windows 10 ***
Main article: Windows_10
On September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows_10 as the successor to
Windows 8.1. It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in
the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes on PC include the
return of the Start Menu, a virtual_desktop system, and the ability to run
Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen
mode. Windows_10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows_7
with SP1, Windows_8.1 and Windows_Phone_8.1 devices from the Get Windows 10
Application (for Windows_7, Windows_8.1) or Windows_Update (Windows_7).[42]
In February 2017, Microsoft announced the migration of its Windows source code
repository from Perforce to Git. This migration involved 3.5 million separate
files in a 300 gigabyte repository.[43] By May 2017, 90 percent of its
engineering team now uses Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds
per day.[43]
*** Multilingual support ***
Multilingual support is built into Windows since Windows 3. The language for
both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and
Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as
Input_Method_Editors, are automatically installed during Windows installation
(in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese,
and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately,
also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a
user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.
Interface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some
languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. Language_Interface_Packs
(LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download
Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later) – they translate
most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base
language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for
most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the
complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows
(Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of
Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific
base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French
or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center,
but available as optional updates through the Windows_Update service (except
Windows 8).
The interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in
the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the
application developers themselves.
Windows_8 and Windows_Server_2012 introduces a new Language Control Panel where
both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and
language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location.
The PC Settings app in Windows_8.1 and Windows_Server_2012_R2 also includes a
counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also
changes the language of preinstalled Windows_Store apps (such as Mail, Maps and
News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The
above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that
full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language,
which caters to emerging markets.
*** Platform support ***
Windows NT included support for several different platforms before the x86-
based personal_computer became dominant in the professional world. Windows_NT
4.0 and its predecessors supported PowerPC, DEC_Alpha and MIPS R4000. (Although
some these platforms implement 64-bit_computing, the operating system treated
them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0,
dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as IA-
32) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on
IA-32, although the Windows_Server line has ceased supporting this platform
with the release of Windows_Server_2008_R2.
With the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture (IA-64), Microsoft
released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of Windows_XP
and Windows_Server_2003 were released at the same time as their mainstream x86
counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows
client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to
support this platform until Windows_Server_2012; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the
last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.
On April 25, 2005, Microsoft released Windows_XP_Professional_x64_Edition and
Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the x86-64 (or simply x64), the
eighth generation of x86 architecture. Windows_Vista was the first client
version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions.
x64 is still supported.
An edition of Windows 8 known as Windows_RT was specifically created for
computers with ARM_architecture and while ARM is still used for Windows
smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated.
Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for
PCs with ARM_architecture.[44]
**** Windows CE ****
Main articles: Windows_CE and Windows_Phone
The latest current version of Windows CE, Windows_Embedded_Compact_7,
displaying a concept media player UI
Windows CE (officially known as Windows Embedded Compact), is an edition of
Windows that runs on minimalistic_computers, like satellite navigation systems
and some mobile phones. Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated
kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to OEMs and
device makers. The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user
interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation
to do so.
Windows CE was used in the Dreamcast along with Sega's own proprietary OS for
the console. Windows CE was the core from which Windows_Mobile was derived. Its
successor, Windows_Phone_7, was based on components from both Windows_CE_6.0_R3
and Windows_CE_7.0. Windows_Phone_8 however, is based on the same NT-kernel as
Windows 8.
Windows Embedded Compact is not to be confused with Windows_XP_Embedded or
Windows_NT_4.0_Embedded, modular editions of Windows based on Windows NT
kernel.
**** Xbox OS ****

Xbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on the
Xbox_One.[45] It is a more specific implementation with an emphasis on
virtualization (using Hyper-V) as it is three operating systems running at
once, consisting of the core operating system, a second implemented for games
and a more Windows-like environment for applications.[46] Microsoft updates
Xbox One's OS every month, and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox
Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed, or by using offline
recovery images downloaded via a PC.[47] The Windows 10-based Core had replaced
the Windows 8-based one in this update, and the new system is sometimes
referred to as "Windows 10 on Xbox One" or "OneCore".[48][49] Xbox One's system
also allows backward compatibility with Xbox 360,[50] and the Xbox 360's system
is backwards compatible with the original Xbox.[51]
***** Version control system *****
In 2017 Microsoft announced that it would start using Git, an open source
version control system created by Linus_Torvalds. Microsoft has previously used
a proprietary version control system called "Source Depot". Microsoft began to
integrate Git into Team_Foundation_Server in 2013, but Windows continued to
rely on Source Depot. However, this decision came with some complexity. The
Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of
Linux development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git
repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved
unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several
hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File
System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.[52]

According to Net_Applications, which tracks the use of operating systems in
devices that are active on the Web, Windows was the most used operating-system
family on personal computers in July 2017, with close to 90% usage share.[58]
Including personal computers of all kinds (e.g., desktops, laptops, mobile
devices), Windows OSes accounted for 35.24% of usage share in July 2017,
compared to Android (highest, at 41.24%), iOS's 13.22%, and macOS's 4.64%,
according to StatCounter, which tracks use of operating systems by their use in
devices active on the Web.[59][60] Windows is used in less than half the market
not only in developing countries, but also in developed onesâsuch as the
United_States, where use of Windows on desktops, on which it is the plurality
operating system, has fallen to 46.18%,[61] and the United_Kingdom and Ireland.
These numbers are easiest (monthly numbers) to find that track real use, but
they may not mirror installed base or sales numbers (in recent years) of
devices. They are consistent with server numbers in next section.
In terms of the number of devices shipped with the operating system installed,
on smartphones, Windows Phone was the third-most-shipped OS (2.6%) after
Android (82.8%) and iOS (13.9%) in the second quarter of 2015 according to IDC.
[62] Across both PCs and mobile devices, in 2014, Windows OSes were the second-
most-shipped (333 million devices, or 14%) after Android (1.2 billion, 49%) and
ahead of iOS and macOS combined (263 million, 11%).[63]
Use of the latest version Windows_10 has exceeded Windows 7 globally since
early 2018.[64] In most developed countries, such as Japan, Australia and the
US, Windows 10 already was the most popular version since early 2017.[65]
**** Usage share on servers ****
Usage share of Windows on servers – those running a web_servers that is (there
are also other kinds of servers) – is at 33.6%.[66]
***** Security *****
Consumer versions of Windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a
single-user PC without a network connection, and did not have security features
built in from the outset.[67] However, Windows NT and its successors are
designed for security (including on a network) and multi-user PCs, but were not
initially designed with Internet security in mind as much, since, when it was
first developed in the early 1990s, Internet use was less prevalent.[68]
These design issues combined with programming errors (e.g. buffer_overflows)
and the popularity of Windows means that it is a frequent target of computer
worm and virus writers. In June 2005, Bruce_Schneier's Counterpane Internet
Security reported that it had seen over 1,000 new viruses and worms in the
previous six months.[69] In 2005, Kaspersky_Lab found around 11,000 malicious
programsâviruses, Trojans, back-doors, and exploits written for Windows.[70]
Microsoft releases security patches through its Windows_Update service
approximately once a month (usually the second_Tuesday of the month), although
critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary.[71] In
versions of Windows after and including Windows 2000 SP3 and Windows XP,
updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do
so. As a result, Service Pack 2 for Windows XP, as well as Service Pack 1 for
Windows Server 2003, were installed by users more quickly than it otherwise
might have been.[72]
While the Windows_9x series offered the option of having profiles for multiple
users, they had no concept of access_privileges, and did not allow concurrent
access; and so were not true multi-user operating systems. In addition, they
implemented only partial memory_protection. They were accordingly widely
criticised for lack of security.
The Windows_NT series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user,
and implement absolute memory protection. However, a lot of the advantages of
being a true multi-user operating system were nullified by the fact that, prior
to Windows Vista, the first user account created during the setup process was
an administrator account, which was also the default for new accounts. Though
Windows_XP did have limited accounts, the majority of home users did not change
to an account type with fewer rights â partially due to the number of
programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights â and so most home
users ran as administrator all the time.
Windows_Vista changes this[73] by introducing a privilege elevation system
called User_Account_Control. When logging in as a standard user, a logon
session is created and a token containing only the most basic privileges is
assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes
that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the
Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token
contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second
is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User
applications, including the Windows_shell, are then started with the restricted
token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator
account. When an application requests higher privileges or "Run as
administrator" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is
given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the
elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using
the unrestricted token.[74]
Leaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed Vault_7 and dated from
2013â2016, detail the capabilities of the CIA to perform electronic
surveillance and cyber warfare,[75] such as the ability to compromise operating
systems such as Microsoft Windows.[76]
**** File permissions ****
All Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system
permission system referred to as AGDLP (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions)
in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a
'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members. These global
groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions
used. This system varies from other vendor products such as Linux and NetWare
due to the 'static' allocation of permission being applied directory to the
file or folder. However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small
number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the
account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and
folders.
**** Windows Defender ****
On January 6, 2005, Microsoft released a Beta_version of Microsoft AntiSpyware,
based upon the previously released Giant AntiSpyware. On February 14, 2006,
Microsoft AntiSpyware became Windows_Defender with the release of Beta 2.
Windows Defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and
other unwanted software. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users who have
genuine copies of Microsoft Windows can freely download the program from
Microsoft's web site, and Windows Defender ships as part of Windows Vista and
7.[77] In Windows 8, Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials have
been combined into a single program, named Windows Defender. It is based on
Microsoft_Security_Essentials, borrowing its features and user interface.
Although it is enabled by default, it can be turned off to use another anti-
virus solution.[78] Windows_Malicious_Software_Removal_Tool and the optional
Microsoft_Safety_Scanner are two other free security products offered by
Microsoft. In the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Microsoft introduced the
Limited Periodic Scanning feature, which allows Windows Defender to scan,
detect, and remove any threats that third-party anti-virus software missed. The
Advanced Threat Protection service is introduced for enterprise users. The new
service uses cloud service to detect and take actions on advanced network
attacks.
**** Third-party analysis ****
                        This section needs to be updated. Please update this
[Ambox current red.svg] article to reflect recent events or newly available
                        information. (October 2018)
In an article based on a report by Symantec,[79] internetnews.com has described
Microsoft Windows as having the "fewest number of patches and the shortest
average patch development time of the five operating systems it monitored in
the last six months of 2006."[80]
A study conducted by Kevin_Mitnick and marketing communications firm Avantgarde
in 2004, found that an unprotected and unpatched Windows XP system with Service
Pack 1 lasted only four minutes on the Internet before it was compromised, and
an unprotected and also unpatched Windows Server 2003 system was compromised
after being connected to the internet for 8 hours.[81] The computer that was
running Windows XP Service Pack 2 was not compromised. The AOL National Cyber
Security Alliance Online Safety Study of October 2004, determined that 80% of
Windows users were infected by at least one spyware/adware product.[citation
needed] Much documentation is available describing how to increase the security
of Microsoft Windows products. Typical suggestions include deploying Microsoft
Windows behind a hardware or software firewall, running anti-virus and anti-
spyware software, and installing patches as they become available through
Windows Update.[82]
***** Alternative implementations *****
Owing to the operating system's popularity, a number of applications have been
released that aim to provide compatibility with Windows applications, either as
a compatibility_layer for another operating system, or as a standalone system
that can run software written for Windows out of the box. These include:
    * Wine â a free_and_open-source implementation of the Windows_API,
      allowing one to run many Windows applications on x86-based platforms,
      including UNIX, Linux and macOS. Wine developers refer to it as a
      "compatibility layer"[83] and use Windows-style APIs to emulate Windows
      environment.
          o CrossOver â a Wine package with licensed fonts. Its developers
            are regular contributors to Wine, and focus on Wine running
            officially supported applications.
          o Cedega â a proprietary fork of Wine by TransGaming_Technologies,
            designed specifically for running Microsoft Windows games on Linux.
            A version of Cedega known as Cider allows Windows games to run on
            macOS. Since Wine was licensed under the LGPL, Cedega has been
            unable to port the improvements made to Wine to their proprietary
            codebase. Cedega ceased its service in February 2011.
          o Darwine â a port of Wine for macOS and Darwin. Operates by
            running Wine on QEMU.
          o Linux_Unified_Kernel â a set of patches to the Linux kernel
            allowing many Windows executable files in Linux (using Wine DLLs);
            and some Windows drivers to be used.
    * ReactOS â an open-source OS intended to run the same software as
      Windows, originally designed to simulate Windows NT 4.0, now aiming at
      Windows 7 compatibility. It has been in the development_stage since 1996.
    * Linspire â formerly LindowsOS, a commercial Linux distribution
      initially created with the goal of running major Windows software.
      Changed its name to Linspire after Microsoft_v._Lindows. Discontinued in
      favor of Xandros_Desktop, that was also later discontinued.

      a number of novel concepts until it was suspended in 2002.[84][85][86]
