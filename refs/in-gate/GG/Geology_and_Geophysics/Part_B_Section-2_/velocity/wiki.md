The velocity of an object is the rate_of_change of its position with respect to
a frame_of_reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a
specification of an object's speed and direction of motion (e.g. 60 km/h to the
north). Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of
classical_mechanics that describes the motion of bodies.
Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed
to define it. The scalar absolute_value (magnitude) of velocity is called
speed, being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the SI
(metric_system) as metres_per_second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of
(mâsâ1). For example, "5 metres per second" is a scalar, whereas "5 metres
per second east" is a vector. If there is a change in speed, direction or both,
then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an
acceleration.

***** Constant velocity vs acceleration *****
To have a constant velocity, an object must have a constant speed in a constant
direction. Constant direction constrains the object to motion in a straight
path thus, a constant velocity means motion in a straight line at a constant
speed.
For example, a car moving at a constant 20 kilometres per hour in a circular
path has a constant speed, but does not have a constant velocity because its
direction changes. Hence, the car is considered to be undergoing an
acceleration.
***** Difference between speed and velocity *****
Main article: Speed
Kinematic quantities of a classical particle: mass m, position r, velocity v,
acceleration a.
Speed, the scalar magnitude of a velocity vector, denotes only how fast an
object is moving.[1][2]

**** Average velocity ****
Velocity is defined as the rate of change of position with respect to time,
which may also be referred to as the instantaneous velocity to emphasize the
distinction from the average velocity. In some applications the "average
velocity" of an object might be needed, that is to say, the constant velocity
that would provide the same resultant displacement as a variable velocity in
the same time interval, v(t), over some time period Ît. Average velocity can
be calculated as:
            v &#x00AF;    =    &#x0394;  x    &#x0394;   t      .
      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}={\frac {\Delta {\boldsymbol {x}}}
      {\Delta {\mathit {t}}}}.}  [{\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}={\frac {\Delta
      {\boldsymbol {x}}}{\Delta {\mathit {t}}}}.]
The average velocity is always less than or equal to the average speed of an
object. This can be seen by realizing that while distance is always strictly
increasing, displacement can increase or decrease in magnitude as well as
change direction.
In terms of a displacement-time (x vs. t) graph, the instantaneous velocity
(or, simply, velocity) can be thought of as the slope_of_the_tangent_line_to
the_curve_at_any_point, and the average velocity as the slope of the secant
line between two points with t coordinates equal to the boundaries of the time
period for the average velocity.
The average velocity is the same as the velocity averaged over time â that is
to say, its time-weighted average, which may be calculated as the time integral
of the velocity:
            v &#x00AF;    =   1   t  1   &#x2212;  t  0       &#x222B;   t  0
      t  1      v  ( t ) &#xA0; d t ,   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\bar
      {v}}}={1 \over t_{1}-t_{0}}\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}{\boldsymbol {v}}(t)\
      dt,}  [{\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}={1 \over t_{1}-t_{0}}\int _{t_{0}}^{t_
      {1}}{\boldsymbol {v}}(t)\ dt,]
where we may identify
         &#x0394;  x  =  &#x222B;   t  0      t  1      v  ( t ) &#xA0; d t
      {\displaystyle \Delta {\boldsymbol {x}}=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}{\boldsymbol
      {v}}(t)\ dt}  [\Delta {\boldsymbol {x}}=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}{\boldsymbol
      {v}}(t)\ dt]
and
         &#x0394; t =  t  1   &#x2212;  t  0   .   {\displaystyle \Delta t=t_
      {1}-t_{0}.}  [\Delta t=t_{1}-t_{0}.]
**** Instantaneous velocity ****
Example of a velocity vs. time graph, and the relationship between velocity v
on the y-axis, acceleration a (the three green tangent lines represent the
values for acceleration at different points along the curve) and displacement s
(the yellow area under the curve.)
If we consider v as velocity and x as the displacement (change in position)
vector, then we can express the (instantaneous) velocity of a particle or
object, at any particular time t, as the derivative of the position with
respect to time:
          v  =  lim   &#x0394; t  &#x2192; 0      &#x0394;  x    &#x0394; t
      =    d  x    d   t      .   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}=\lim _{
      {\Delta t}\to 0}{\frac {\Delta {\boldsymbol {x}}}{\Delta t}}={\frac {d
      {\boldsymbol {x}}}{d{\mathit {t}}}}.}  [{\boldsymbol {v}}=\lim _{{\Delta
      t}\to 0}{\frac {\Delta {\boldsymbol {x}}}{\Delta t}}={\frac {d
      {\boldsymbol {x}}}{d{\mathit {t}}}}.]
From this derivative equation, in the one-dimensional case it can be seen that
the area under a velocity vs. time (v vs. t graph) is the displacement, x. In
calculus terms, the integral of the velocity function v(t) is the displacement
function x(t). In the figure, this corresponds to the yellow area under the
curve labeled s (s being an alternative notation for displacement).
          x  = &#x222B;  v  &#xA0; d   t   .   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol
      {x}}=\int {\boldsymbol {v}}\ d{\mathit {t}}.}  [{\displaystyle
      {\boldsymbol {x}}=\int {\boldsymbol {v}}\ d{\mathit {t}}.}]
Since the derivative of the position with respect to time gives the change in
position (in metres) divided by the change in time (in seconds), velocity is
measured in metres_per_second (m/s). Although the concept of an instantaneous
velocity might at first seem counter-intuitive, it may be thought of as the
velocity that the object would continue to travel at if it stopped accelerating
at that moment.
**** Relationship to acceleration ****
Although velocity is defined as the rate of change of position, it is often
common to start with an expression for an object's acceleration. As seen by the
three green tangent lines in the figure, an object's instantaneous acceleration
at a point in time is the slope of the line_tangent to the curve of a v(t)
graph at that point. In other words, acceleration is defined as the derivative
of velocity with respect to time:
          a  =    d  v    d   t      .   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {a}}=
      {\frac {d{\boldsymbol {v}}}{d{\mathit {t}}}}.}  [{\boldsymbol {a}}={\frac
      {d{\boldsymbol {v}}}{d{\mathit {t}}}}.]
From there, we can obtain an expression for velocity as the area under an a(t)
acceleration vs. time graph. As above, this is done using the concept of the
integral:
          v  = &#x222B;  a  &#xA0; d   t   .   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol
      {v}}=\int {\boldsymbol {a}}\ d{\mathit {t}}.}  [{\displaystyle
      {\boldsymbol {v}}=\int {\boldsymbol {a}}\ d{\mathit {t}}.}]
*** Constant acceleration ***
In the special case of constant acceleration, velocity can be studied using the
suvat_equations. By considering a as being equal to some arbitrary constant
vector, it is trivial to show that
          v  =  u  +  a  t   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}={\boldsymbol
      {u}}+{\boldsymbol {a}}t}  [{\boldsymbol {v}}={\boldsymbol {u}}+
      {\boldsymbol {a}}t]
with v as the velocity at time t and u as the velocity at time t = 0. By
combining this equation with the suvat equation x = ut + at2/2, it is possible
to relate the displacement and the average velocity by
          x  =    (  u  +  v  )  2     t   =    v &#x00AF;      t
      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {x}}={\frac {({\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol
      {v}})}{2}}{\mathit {t}}={\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}{\mathit {t}}}  [
      {\boldsymbol {x}}={\frac {({\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol {v}})}{2}}
      {\mathit {t}}={\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}{\mathit {t}}].
It is also possible to derive an expression for the velocity independent of
time, known as the Torricelli_equation, as follows:
          v  2   =  v  &#x22C5;  v  = (  u  +  a  t ) &#x22C5; (  u  +  a  t )
      =  u  2   + 2 t (  a  &#x22C5;  u  ) +  a  2    t  2     {\displaystyle
      v^{2}={\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {v}}=({\boldsymbol {u}}+
      {\boldsymbol {a}}t)\cdot ({\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol {a}}t)=u^{2}+2t(
      {\boldsymbol {a}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {u}})+a^{2}t^{2}}  [v^{2}=
      {\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {v}}=({\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol
      {a}}t)\cdot ({\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol {a}}t)=u^{2}+2t({\boldsymbol
      {a}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {u}})+a^{2}t^{2}]
         ( 2  a  ) &#x22C5;  x  = ( 2  a  ) &#x22C5; (  u  t +   1 2    a   t
      2   ) = 2 t (  a  &#x22C5;  u  ) +  a  2    t  2   =  v  2   &#x2212;  u
      2     {\displaystyle (2{\boldsymbol {a}})\cdot {\boldsymbol {x}}=(2
      {\boldsymbol {a}})\cdot ({\boldsymbol {u}}t+{\frac {1}{2}}{\boldsymbol
      {a}}t^{2})=2t({\boldsymbol {a}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {u}})+a^{2}t^{2}=v^{2}-
      u^{2}}  [(2{\boldsymbol {a}})\cdot {\boldsymbol {x}}=(2{\boldsymbol
      {a}})\cdot ({\boldsymbol {u}}t+{\frac {1}{2}}{\boldsymbol {a}}t^{2})=2t(
      {\boldsymbol {a}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {u}})+a^{2}t^{2}=v^{2}-u^{2}]
         &#x2234;  v  2   =  u  2   + 2 (  a  &#x22C5;  x  )   {\displaystyle
      \therefore v^{2}=u^{2}+2({\boldsymbol {a}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {x}})}
      [\therefore v^{2}=u^{2}+2({\boldsymbol {a}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {x}})]
where v = |v| etc.
The above equations are valid for both Newtonian_mechanics and special
relativity. Where Newtonian mechanics and special relativity differ is in how
different observers would describe the same situation. In particular, in
Newtonian mechanics, all observers agree on the value of t and the
transformation rules for position create a situation in which all non-
accelerating observers would describe the acceleration of an object with the
same values. Neither is true for special relativity. In other words, only
relative velocity can be calculated.
**** Quantities that are dependent on velocity ****
The kinetic_energy of a moving object is dependent on its velocity and is given
by the equation
          E  k   =    1 2    m  v  2     {\displaystyle E_{\text{k}}={\tfrac
      {1}{2}}mv^{2}}  [E_{\text{k}}={\tfrac {1}{2}}mv^{2}]
ignoring special_relativity, where Ek is the kinetic energy and m is the mass.
Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity as it depends on the square of the
velocity, however a related quantity, momentum, is a vector and defined by
          p  = m  v    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}=m{\boldsymbol {v}}}  [
      {\boldsymbol {p}}=m{\boldsymbol {v}}]
In special_relativity, the dimensionless Lorentz_factor appears frequently, and
is given by
         &#x03B3; =   1  1 &#x2212;    v  2    c  2          {\displaystyle
      \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}  [\gamma ={\frac
      {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}]
where Î³ is the Lorentz factor and c is the speed of light.
Escape_velocity is the minimum speed a ballistic object needs to escape from a
massive body such as Earth. It represents the kinetic energy that, when added
to the object's gravitational potential energy, (which is always negative) is
equal to zero. The general formula for the escape velocity of an object at a
distance r from the center of a planet with mass M is
          v  e   =     2 G M  r    =   2 g r   ,   {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}=
      {\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{r}}}={\sqrt {2gr}},}  [v_{\text{e}}={\sqrt {\frac
      {2GM}{r}}}={\sqrt {2gr}},]
where G is the Gravitational_constant and g is the Gravitational_acceleration.
The escape velocity from Earth's surface is about 11 200 m/s, and is
irrespective of the direction of the object. This makes "escape velocity"
somewhat of a misnomer, as the more correct term would be "escape speed": any
object attaining a velocity of that magnitude, irrespective of atmosphere, will
leave the vicinity of the base body as long as it doesn't intersect with
something in its path.
***** Relative velocity *****
Main article: Relative_velocity
Relative velocity is a measurement of velocity between two objects as
determined in a single coordinate system. Relative velocity is fundamental in
both classical and modern physics, since many systems in physics deal with the
relative motion of two or more particles. In Newtonian mechanics, the relative
velocity is independent of the chosen inertial reference frame. This is not the
case anymore with special_relativity in which velocities depend on the choice
of reference frame.
If an object A is moving with velocity vector v and an object B with velocity
vector w, then the velocity of object A relative to object B is defined as the
difference of the two velocity vectors:
           v   A  &#xA0;relative to&#xA0;  B   =  v  &#x2212;  w
      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{A{\text{ relative to }}B}={\boldsymbol
      {v}}-{\boldsymbol {w}}}  [{\boldsymbol {v}}_{A{\text{ relative to }}B}=
      {\boldsymbol {v}}-{\boldsymbol {w}}]
Similarly, the relative velocity of object B moving with velocity w, relative
to object A moving with velocity v is:
           v   B  &#xA0;relative to&#xA0;  A   =  w  &#x2212;  v
      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{B{\text{ relative to }}A}={\boldsymbol
      {w}}-{\boldsymbol {v}}}  [{\boldsymbol {v}}_{B{\text{ relative to }}A}=
      {\boldsymbol {w}}-{\boldsymbol {v}}]
Usually, the inertial frame chosen is that in which the latter of the two
mentioned objects is in rest.
**** Scalar velocities ****
In the one-dimensional case,[3] the velocities are scalars and the equation is
either:
           v  r e l   = v &#x2212; ( &#x2212; w )   {\displaystyle \,v_{rel}=v-
      (-w)}  [\,v_{rel}=v-(-w)], if the two objects are moving in opposite
      directions, or:
           v  r e l   = v &#x2212; ( + w )   {\displaystyle \,v_{rel}=v-(+w)}
      [\,v_{rel}=v-(+w)], if the two objects are moving in the same direction.
***** Polar coordinates *****
In polar_coordinates, a two-dimensional velocity is described by a radial
velocity, defined as the component of velocity away from or toward the origin
(also known as velocity made good), and an angular_velocity, which is the rate
of rotation about the origin (with positive quantities representing counter-
clockwise rotation and negative quantities representing clockwise rotation, in
a right-handed coordinate system).
The radial and angular velocities can be derived from the Cartesian velocity
and displacement vectors by decomposing the velocity vector into radial and
transverse components. The transverse velocity is the component of velocity
along a circle centered at the origin.
          v  =   v   T   +   v   R     {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}=
      {\boldsymbol {v}}_{T}+{\boldsymbol {v}}_{R}}  [{\boldsymbol {v}}=
      {\boldsymbol {v}}_{T}+{\boldsymbol {v}}_{R}]
where
           v   T     {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{T}}  [{\boldsymbol {v}}_
      {T}] is the transverse velocity
           v   R     {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{R}}  [{\boldsymbol {v}}_
      {R}] is the radial velocity.
The magnitude of the radial velocity is the dot_product of the velocity vector
and the unit vector in the direction of the displacement.
          v  R   =     v  &#x22C5;  r    |  r  |      {\displaystyle v_{R}=
      {\frac {{\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {r}}}{\left|{\boldsymbol
      {r}}\right|}}}  [v_{R}={\frac {{\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {r}}}
      {\left|{\boldsymbol {r}}\right|}}]
where
          r    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}}  [{\boldsymbol {r}}] is
      displacement.
The magnitude of the transverse velocity is that of the cross_product of the
unit vector in the direction of the displacement and the velocity vector. It is
also the product of the angular_speed     &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle \omega }
[\omega ] and the magnitude of the displacement.
          v  T   =     |   r  &#x00D7;  v   |     |   r   |     = &#x03C9;  |
      r   |    {\displaystyle v_{T}={\frac {|{\boldsymbol {r}}\times
      {\boldsymbol {v}}|}{|{\boldsymbol {r}}|}}=\omega |{\boldsymbol {r}}|}
      [v_{T}={\frac {|{\boldsymbol {r}}\times {\boldsymbol {v}}|}{|{\boldsymbol
      {r}}|}}=\omega |{\boldsymbol {r}}|]
such that
         &#x03C9; =     |   r  &#x00D7;  v   |     |   r    |   2      .
      {\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {|{\boldsymbol {r}}\times {\boldsymbol
      {v}}|}{|{\boldsymbol {r}}|^{2}}}.}  [\omega ={\frac {|{\boldsymbol
      {r}}\times {\boldsymbol {v}}|}{|{\boldsymbol {r}}|^{2}}}.]
Angular_momentum in scalar form is the mass times the distance to the origin
times the transverse velocity, or equivalently, the mass times the distance
squared times the angular speed. The sign convention for angular momentum is
the same as that for angular velocity.
         L = m r  v  T   = m  r  2   &#x03C9;    {\displaystyle L=mrv_{T}=mr^
      {2}\omega \,}  [L=mrv_{T}=mr^{2}\omega \,]
where
         m    {\displaystyle m\,}  [m\,] is mass
         r = &#x2016;  r  &#x2016; .   {\displaystyle r=\|{\boldsymbol {r}}\|.}
      [r=\|{\boldsymbol {r}}\|.]
The expression     m  r  2     {\displaystyle mr^{2}}  [mr^{2}] is known as
moment_of_inertia. If forces are in the radial direction only with an inverse
square dependence, as in the case of a gravitational orbit, angular momentum is
constant, and transverse speed is inversely proportional to the distance,
angular speed is inversely proportional to the distance squared, and the rate
at which area is swept out is constant. These relations are known as Kepler's
laws_of_planetary_motion.
