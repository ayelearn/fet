Study of Earth's magnetic field in past
This term is also sometimes used for Natural_remanent_magnetization.
Magnetic stripes are the result of reversals of the Earth's field and seafloor
spreading. New oceanic crust is magnetized as it forms and then it moves away
from the ridge in both directions. The models show a ridge (a) about 5 million
years ago (b) about 2 to 3 million years ago and (c) in the present.[1]
Paleomagnetism (or palaeomagnetism in the United Kingdom) is the study of the
record of the Earth's_magnetic_field in rocks, sediment, or archeological
materials. Certain minerals in rocks lock-in a record of the direction and
intensity of the magnetic field when they form. This record provides
information on the past behavior of Earth's magnetic field and the past
location of tectonic_plates. The record of geomagnetic_reversals preserved in
volcanic and sedimentary_rock sequences (magnetostratigraphy) provides a time-
scale that is used as a geochronologic tool. Geophysicists who specialize in
paleomagnetism are called paleomagnetists.
Paleomagnetists led the revival of the continental_drift hypothesis and its
transformation into plate_tectonics. Apparent_polar_wander paths provided the
first clear geophysical evidence for continental_drift, while marine magnetic
anomalies did the same for seafloor_spreading. Paleomagnetism continues to
extend the history of plate_tectonics back in time and are applied to the
movement of continental fragments, or terranes.
Paleomagnetism relied heavily on new developments in rock_magnetism, which in
turn has provided the foundation for new applications of magnetism. These
include biomagnetism, magnetic fabrics (used as strain indicators in rocks and
soils), and environmental magnetism.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_geomagnetism
As early as the 18th century, it was noticed that compass needles deviated near
strongly magnetized outcrops. In 1797, Von Humboldt attributed this
magnetization to lightning strikes (and lightning strikes do often magnetize
surface rocks).[2][3] In the 19th century studies of the direction of
magnetization in rocks showed that some recent lavas were magnetized parallel
to the Earth's magnetic field. Early in the 20th century, work by David,
Brunhes and Mercanton showed that many rocks were magnetized antiparallel to
the field. Japanese geophysicist Motonori_Matuyama showed that the Earth's
magnetic field reversed in the mid-Quaternary, a reversal now known as the
Brunhes-Matuyama_reversal.[2]
The British physicist P.M.S._Blackett provided a major impetus to
paleomagnetism by inventing a sensitive astatic magnetometer in 1956. His
intent was to test his theory that the geomagnetic_field was related to the
Earth's rotation, a theory that he ultimately rejected; but the astatic
magnetometer became the basic tool of paleomagnetism and led to a revival of
the theory of continental_drift. Alfred_Wegener first proposed in 1915 that
continents had once been joined together and had since moved apart.[4] Although
he produced an abundance of circumstantial evidence, his theory met with little
acceptance for two reasons: (1) no mechanism for continental_drift was known,
and (2) there was no way to reconstruct the movements of the continents over
time. Keith_Runcorn[5] and Edward_A._Irving[6] constructed apparent_polar
wander paths for Europe and North America. These curves diverged, but could be
reconciled if it was assumed that the continents had been in contact up to 200
million years ago. This provided the first clear geophysical evidence for
continental drift. Then in 1963, Morley,_Vine_and_Matthews showed that marine
magnetic_anomalies provided evidence for seafloor_spreading.
***** Fields[edit] *****
Paleomagnetism is studied on a number of scales:
    * Secular_variation studies look at small-scale changes in the direction
      and intensity of the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetic north_pole is
      constantly shifting relative to the axis of rotation of the Earth.
      Magnetism is a vector and so magnetic field variation is made up of
      palaeodirectional measurements of magnetic_declination and magnetic
      inclination and palaeointensity measurements.
Earth's magnetic polarity reversals in last 5 million years. Dark regions
represent normal polarity (same as present field); light regions represent
reversed polarity.
    * Magnetostratigraphy uses the polarity reversal history of the Earth's
      magnetic field recorded in rocks to determine the age of those rocks.
      Reversals have occurred at irregular intervals throughout Earth_history.
      The age and pattern of these reversals is known from the study of sea
      floor_spreading zones and the dating of volcanic rocks.
***** Principles of remanent magnetization[edit] *****
The study of paleomagnetism is possible because iron-bearing minerals such as
magnetite may record past directions of the Earth's magnetic field. Magnetic
signatures in rocks can be recorded by several different mechanisms.
**** Thermoremanent magnetization[edit] ****
Main article: Thermoremanent_magnetization
Iron-titanium oxide minerals in basalt and other igneous rocks may preserve the
direction of the Earth's magnetic field when the rocks cool through the Curie
temperatures of those minerals. The Curie temperature of magnetite, a spinel-
group iron_oxide, is about 580Â°C, whereas most basalt and gabbro are
completely crystallized at temperatures below 900Â°C. Hence, the mineral grains
are not rotated physically to align with the Earth's field, but rather they may
record the orientation of that field. The record so preserved is called a
thermoremanent_magnetization (TRM). Because complex oxidation reactions may
occur as igneous rocks cool after crystallization, the orientations of the
Earth's magnetic field are not always accurately recorded, nor is the record
necessarily maintained. Nonetheless, the record has been preserved well enough
in basalts of the ocean crust to have been critical in the development of
theories of sea floor spreading related to plate_tectonics. TRM can also be
recorded in pottery kilns, hearths, and burned adobe buildings. The discipline
based on the study of thermoremanent magnetisation in archaeological materials
is called archaeomagnetic_dating.[7]
**** Detrital remanent magnetization[edit] ****
In a completely different process, magnetic grains in sediments may align with
the magnetic field during or soon after deposition; this is known as detrital
remanent magnetization (DRM). If the magnetization is acquired as the grains
are deposited, the result is a depositional detrital remanent magnetization
(dDRM); if it is acquired soon after deposition, it is a post-depositional
detrital remanent magnetization (pDRM).[8]
**** Chemical remanent magnetization[edit] ****
See also: Chemical_remanent_magnetization
In a third process, magnetic grains grow during chemical reactions, and record
the direction of the magnetic field at the time of their formation. The field
is said to be recorded by chemical remanent magnetization (CRM). A common form
of chemical remanent magnetization is held by the mineral hematite, another
iron_oxide. Hematite forms through chemical oxidation reactions of other
minerals in the rock including magnetite. Redbeds, clastic sedimentary rocks
(such as sandstones) are red because of hematite that formed during sedimentary
diagenesis. The CRM signatures in redbeds can be quite useful and they are
common targets in magnetostratigraphy studies.[9]
**** Isothermal remanent magnetization[edit] ****
See also: Remanence
Remanence that is acquired at a fixed temperature is called isothermal remanent
magnetization (IRM). Remanence of this sort is not useful for paleomagnetism,
but it can be acquired as a result of lightning strikes. Lightning-induced
remanent_magnetization can be distinguished by its high intensity and rapid
variation in direction over scales of centimeters.[10][9]
IRM is often induced in drill cores by the magnetic field of the steel core
barrel. This contaminant is generally parallel to the barrel, and most of it
can be removed by heating up to about 400 â or demagnetizing in a small
alternating field.
In the laboratory, IRM is induced by applying fields of various strengths and
is used for many purposes in rock_magnetism.
**** Viscous remanent magnetization[edit] ****
Main article: Viscous_remanent_magnetization
Viscous remanent magnetization is remanence that is acquired by ferromagnetic
materials by sitting in a magnetic field for some time.
***** Paleomagnetic procedure[edit] *****
**** Collecting samples on land[edit] ****
The oldest rocks on the ocean floor are 200 mya â very young when compared
with the oldest continental rocks, which date from 3.8 billion years ago. In
order to collect paleomagnetic data dating beyond 200 mya, scientists turn to
magnetite-bearing samples on land to reconstruct the Earth's ancient field
orientation.
Paleomagnetists, like many geologists, gravitate towards outcrops because
layers of rock are exposed. Road cuts are a convenient man-made source of
outcrops.
      "And everywhere, in profusion along this half mile of [roadcut], there
      are small, neatly cored holes ... appears to be a Hilton for wrens and
      purple martins."[11]
There are two main goals of sampling:
   1. Retrieve samples with accurate orientations, and
   2. Reduce statistical uncertainty.
One way to achieve the first goal is to use a rock coring drill that has a pipe
tipped with diamond bits. The drill cuts a cylindrical space around some rock.
This can be messy â the drill must be cooled with water, and the result is
mud spewing out of the hole. Into this space is inserted another pipe with
compass and inclinometer attached. These provide the orientations. Before this
device is removed, a mark is scratched on the sample. After the sample is
broken off, the mark can be augmented for clarity.[12]
***** Applications[edit] *****
Paleomagnetic evidence, both reversals and polar wandering data, was
instrumental in verifying the theories of continental_drift and plate_tectonics
in the 1960s and 1970s. Some applications of paleomagnetic evidence to
reconstruct histories of terranes have continued to arouse controversies.
Paleomagnetic evidence is also used in constraining possible ages for rocks and
processes and in reconstructions of the deformational histories of parts of the
crust.[3]
Reversal magnetostratigraphy is often used to estimate the age of sites bearing
fossils and hominin remains.[13] Conversely, for a fossil of known age, the
paleomagnetic data can fix the latitude at which the fossil was laid down. Such
a paleolatitude provides information about the geological environment at the
time of deposition.
Paleomagnetic studies are combined with geochronological methods to determine
absolute ages for rocks in which the magnetic record is preserved. For igneous
rocks such as basalt, commonly used methods include potassiumâargon and
argonâargon geochronology.
Scientists in New_Zealand have found that they are able to figure out the
Earth's past magnetic field changes by studying 700- to 800-year-old steam
ovens, or hangi, used by the Maori for cooking food.[14]
