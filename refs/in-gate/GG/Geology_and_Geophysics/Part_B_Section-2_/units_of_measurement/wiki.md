A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and
adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of
the same kind of quantity.[1] Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed
as a multiple of the unit of measurement.
For example, a length is a physical_quantity. The metre is a unit of length
that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10 metres (or
10 m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called
"metre". Measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical
quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.
The definition, agreement, and practical use of units of measurement have
played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to the present. A
multitude of systems_of_units used to be very common. Now there is a global
standard, the International_System_of_Units (SI), the modern form of the metric
system.
In trade, weights and measures is often a subject of governmental regulation,
to ensure fairness and transparency. The International_Bureau_of_Weights_and
Measures (BIPM) is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements
and their traceability to the International System of Units (SI).
Metrology is the science of developing nationally and internationally accepted
units of measurement.
In physics and metrology, units are standards for measurement of physical
quantities that need clear definitions to be useful. Reproducibility of
experimental results is central to the scientific_method. A standard system of
units facilitates this. Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the
concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.
Science, medicine, and engineering often use larger and smaller units of
measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the
units of measurement can aid researchers in problem_solving (see, for example,
dimensional_analysis).
In the social_sciences, there are no standard units of measurement and the
theory and practice of measurement is studied in psychometrics and the theory
of_conjoint_measurement.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_measurement
A unit of measurement is a standardised quantity of a physical property, used
as a factor to express occurring quantities of that property. Units of
measurement were among the earliest tools invented by humans. Primitive
societies needed rudimentary measures for many tasks: constructing dwellings of
an appropriate size and shape, fashioning clothing, or bartering food or raw
materials.
The earliest known uniform systems of measurement seem to have all been created
sometime in the 4th and 3rd_millennia_BC among the ancient peoples of
Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus_Valley, and perhaps also Elam in Persia as
well.
Weights and measures are mentioned in the Bible (Leviticus 19:35â36). It is a
commandment to be honest and have fair measures.
In the Magna_Carta of 1215 (The Great Charter) with the seal of King_John, put
before him by the Barons of England, King John agreed in Clause 35 "There shall
be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, and one measure of ale and
one measure of cornânamely, the London quart;âand one width of dyed and
russet and hauberk clothsânamely, two ells below the selvage..."
As of the 21st Century, multiple unit systems are used all over the world such
as the United States Customary System, the British Customary System, and the
International System. However, the United States is the only industrialized
country that has not yet completely converted to the Metric System. The
systematic effort to develop a universally acceptable system of units dates
back to 1790 when the French National Assembly charged the French Academy of
Sciences to come up such a unit system. This system was the precursor to the
metric system which was quickly developed in France but did not take on
universal acceptance until 1875 when The Metric Convention Treaty was signed by
17 nations. After this treaty was signed, a General Conference of Weights and
Measures (CGPM) was established. The CGPM produced the current SI system which
was adopted in 1954 at the 10th conference of weights and measures. Currently,
the United States is a dual-system society which uses both the SI system and
the US Customary system.[2]
***** Systems of units[edit] *****
Main article: System_of_measurement
The use of a single unit of measurement for some quantity has obvious
drawbacks. For example, it is impractical to use the same unit for the distance
between two cities and the length of a needle. Thus, historically they would
develop independently. One way to make large numbers or small fractions easier
to read, is to use unit_prefixes.
At some point in time though, the need to relate the two units might arise, and
consequently the need to choose one unit as defining the other or vice versa.
For example an inch could be defined in terms of a barleycorn. A system of
measurement is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to
each other.
As science progressed, a need arose to relate the measurement systems of
different quantities, like length and weight and volume. The effort of
attempting to relate different traditional systems between each other exposed
many inconsistencies, and brought about the development of new units and
systems. Systems of measurement in modern use include the metric_system, the
imperial_system, and United_States_customary_units.
**** Traditional systems[edit] ****
Historically many of the systems of measurement which had been in use were to
some extent based on the dimensions of the human body. As a result, units of
measure could vary not only from location to location, but from person to
person.
**** Metric systems[edit] ****
Metric_systems of units have evolved_since_the_adoption_of_the_original_metric
system in France in 1791. The current international standard metric system is
the International_System_of_Units (abbreviated to SI). An important feature of
modern systems is standardization. Each unit has a universally recognized size.
An example of metrication in 1860 when Tuscany became part of modern Italy (ex.
one "libbra" = 339.54 grams)
Both the imperial_units and US_customary_units derive from earlier English
units. Imperial units were mostly used in the British_Commonwealth and the
former British_Empire. US customary units are still the main system of
measurement used in the United_States outside of science, medicine, many
sectors of industry, and some of government and military, and despite Congress
having legally authorised metric measure on 28 July 1866.[3] Some steps towards
US metrication have been made, particularly the redefinition of basic US and
imperial units to derive exactly from SI units. Since the international_yard
and_pound agreement of 1959 the US and imperial inch is now defined as exactly
0.0254 m, and the US and imperial avoirdupois pound is now defined as exactly
453.59237 g.[4]
**** Natural systems[edit] ****
While the above systems of units are based on arbitrary unit values, formalised
as standards, some unit values occur naturally in science. Systems of units
based on these are called natural_units. Similar to natural units, atomic_units
(au) are a convenient system_of_units of measurement used in atomic_physics.
Also a great number of unusual_and_non-standard_units may be encountered. These
may include the solar_mass (2Ã1030 kg), the megaton (the energy released by
detonating one million tons of trinitrotoluene, TNT) and the electronvolt.
**** Legal control of weights and measures[edit] ****
Main articles: Weights_and_Measures_Act and Trading_standards
To reduce the incidence of retail fraud, many national statutes have standard
definitions of weights and measures that may be used (hence "statute measure"),
and these are verified by legal officers.
**** Informal comparison to familiar concepts[edit] ****
Main article: List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement
In informal settings, a quantity may be described as multiples of that of a
familiar entity, which can be easier to contextualise than a value in a formal
unit system. For instance, a publication may describe an area in a foreign
country as a number of multiples of the area of a region local to the
readership. The propensity for certain concepts to be used frequently can give
rise to loosely defined "systems" of units.[5][6]
***** Base and derived units[edit] *****
Different systems of units are based on different choices of a set of base
units. The most widely used system of units is the International System of
Units, or SI. There are seven SI_base_units. All other_SI_units can be derived
from these base units.
For most quantities a unit is necessary to communicate values of that physical
quantity. For example, conveying to someone a particular length without using
some sort of unit is impossible, because a length cannot be described without a
reference used to make sense of the value given.
But not all quantities require a unit of their own. Using physical laws, units
of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities.
Thus only a small set of units is required. These units are taken as the base
units. Other units are derived units. Derived units are a matter of
convenience, as they can be expressed in terms of basic units. Which units are
considered base units is a matter of choice.
***** Calculations with units of measurement[edit] *****
**** Units as dimensions[edit] ****
Any value of a physical_quantity is expressed as a comparison to a unit of that
quantity. For example, the value of a physical quantity Z is expressed as the
product of a unit [Z] and a numerical factor:
         Z = n &#x00D7; [ Z ] = n [ Z ] .   {\displaystyle Z=n\times [Z]=n[Z].}
      [Z=n\times [Z]=n[Z].] For example, let     Z   {\displaystyle Z}  [Z] be
      "2 candlesticks", then     Z = 2 [ Z ] = 2   {\displaystyle Z=2[Z]=2}  [
      {\displaystyle Z=2[Z]=2}] candlestick.
The multiplication sign is usually left out, just as it is left out between
variables in scientific notation of formulas. The conventions used to express
quantities is referred to as quantity_calculus. In formulas the unit [Z] can be
treated as if it were a specific magnitude of a kind of physical dimension: see
dimensional_analysis for more on this treatment.
Units can only be added or subtracted if they are the same type; however units
can always be multiplied or divided, as George_Gamow used to explain. Let
Z  1     {\displaystyle Z_{1}}  [Z_{1}] be "2 candlesticks" and      Z  2
{\displaystyle Z_{2}}  [Z_{2}] "3 cabdrivers", then
      "2 candlesticks" times "3 cabdrivers"     = 6 [  Z  1   ] [  Z  2   ] = 6
      {\displaystyle =6[Z_{1}][Z_{2}]=6}  [{\displaystyle =6[Z_{1}][Z_{2}]=6}]
      candlestick     &#x00D7;   {\displaystyle \times }  [\times ] cabdriver.
A distinction should be made between units and standards. A unit is fixed by
its definition, and is independent of physical conditions such as temperature.
By contrast, a standard is a physical realization of a unit, and realizes that
unit only under certain physical conditions. For example, the metre is a unit,
while a metal bar is a standard. One metre is the same length regardless of
temperature, but a metal bar will be exactly one metre long only at a certain
temperature.
There are certain rules that have to be used when dealing with units:
    * Treat units algebraically. Only add like terms. When a unit is divided by
      itself, the division yields a unitless one. When two different units are
      multiplied or divided, the result is a new unit, referred to by the
      combination of the units. For instance, in SI, the unit of speed is
      metres per second (m/s). See dimensional_analysis. A unit can be
      multiplied by itself, creating a unit with an exponent (e.g. m2/s2). Put
      simply, units obey the laws of indices. (See Exponentiation.)
    * Some units have special names, however these should be treated like their
      equivalents. For example, one newton (N) is equivalent to 1 kgâm/s2.
      Thus a quantity may have several unit designations, for example: the unit
      for surface_tension can be referred to as either N/m (newtons per metre)
      or kg/s2 (kilograms per second squared). Whether these designations are
      equivalent is disputed amongst metrologists.[7]
**** Expressing a physical value in terms of another unit[edit] ****
Conversion_of_units involves comparison of different standard physical values,
either of a single physical quantity or of a physical quantity and a
combination of other physical quantities.
Starting with:
         Z =  n  i   &#x00D7; [ Z  ]  i     {\displaystyle Z=n_{i}\times [Z]_
      {i}}  [Z=n_{i}\times [Z]_{i}]
just replace the original unit     [ Z  ]  i     {\displaystyle [Z]_{i}}  [[Z]_
{i}] with its meaning in terms of the desired unit     [ Z  ]  j
{\displaystyle [Z]_{j}}  [[Z]_{j}], e.g. if     [ Z  ]  i   =  c  i j
&#x00D7; [ Z  ]  j     {\displaystyle [Z]_{i}=c_{ij}\times [Z]_{j}}  [[Z]_
{i}=c_{ij}\times [Z]_{j}], then:
         Z =  n  i   &#x00D7; (  c  i j   &#x00D7; [ Z  ]  j   ) = (  n  i
      &#x00D7;  c  i j   ) &#x00D7; [ Z  ]  j     {\displaystyle Z=n_{i}\times
      (c_{ij}\times [Z]_{j})=(n_{i}\times c_{ij})\times [Z]_{j}}  [Z=n_
      {i}\times (c_{ij}\times [Z]_{j})=(n_{i}\times c_{ij})\times [Z]_{j}]
Now      n  i     {\displaystyle n_{i}}  [n_{i}] and      c  i j
{\displaystyle c_{ij}}  [c_{ij}] are both numerical values, so just calculate
their product.
Or, which is just mathematically the same thing, multiply Z by unity, the
product is still Z:
         Z =  n  i   &#x00D7; [ Z  ]  i   &#x00D7; (  c  i j   &#x00D7; [ Z  ]
      j    /  [ Z  ]  i   )   {\displaystyle Z=n_{i}\times [Z]_{i}\times (c_
      {ij}\times [Z]_{j}/[Z]_{i})}  [Z=n_{i}\times [Z]_{i}\times (c_{ij}\times
      [Z]_{j}/[Z]_{i})]
For example, you have an expression for a physical value Z involving the unit
feet per second (    [ Z  ]  i     {\displaystyle [Z]_{i}}  [[Z]_{i}]) and you
want it in terms of the unit miles per hour (    [ Z  ]  j     {\displaystyle
[Z]_{j}}  [[Z]_{j}]):
   1. Find facts relating the original unit to the desired unit:
            1 mile = 5280 feet and 1 hour = 3600 seconds
   2. Next use the above equations to construct a fraction that has a value of
      unity and that contains units such that, when it is multiplied with the
      original physical value, will cancel the original units:
               1 =    1   m i    5280   f t       a n d   1 =    3600   s    1
            h       {\displaystyle 1={\frac {1\,\mathrm {mi} }{5280\,\mathrm
            {ft} }}\quad \mathrm {and} \quad 1={\frac {3600\,\mathrm {s} }
            {1\,\mathrm {h} }}}  [1={\frac {1\,\mathrm {mi} }{5280\,\mathrm
            {ft} }}\quad \mathrm {and} \quad 1={\frac {3600\,\mathrm {s} }
            {1\,\mathrm {h} }}]
   3. Last, multiply the original expression of the physical value by the
      fraction, called a conversion_factor, to obtain the same physical value
      expressed in terms of a different unit. Note: since valid conversion
      factors are dimensionless and have a numerical value of one, multiplying
      any physical quantity by such a conversion factor (which is 1) does not
      change that physical quantity.
               52.8     f t   s    = 52.8     f t   s       1   m i    5280   f
            t        3600   s    1   h     =    52.8 &#x00D7; 3600  5280     m
            i  /  h  = 36   m i  /  h    {\displaystyle 52.8\,{\frac {\mathrm
            {ft} }{\mathrm {s} }}=52.8\,{\frac {\mathrm {ft} }{\mathrm {s} }}
            {\frac {1\,\mathrm {mi} }{5280\,\mathrm {ft} }}{\frac
            {3600\,\mathrm {s} }{1\,\mathrm {h} }}={\frac {52.8\times 3600}
            {5280}}\,\mathrm {mi/h} =36\,\mathrm {mi/h} }  [52.8\,{\frac
            {\mathrm {ft} }{\mathrm {s} }}=52.8\,{\frac {\mathrm {ft} }{\mathrm
            {s} }}{\frac {1\,\mathrm {mi} }{5280\,\mathrm {ft} }}{\frac
            {3600\,\mathrm {s} }{1\,\mathrm {h} }}={\frac {52.8\times 3600}
            {5280}}\,\mathrm {mi/h} =36\,\mathrm {mi/h} ]
Or as an example using the metric system, you have a value of fuel economy in
the unit litres per 100 kilometres and you want it in terms of the unit
microlitres per metre:
            9    L     100    k m      =    9    L     100    k m
      1000000    &#x03BC; L     1    L         1    k m     1000    m      =
      9 &#x00D7; 1000000   100 &#x00D7; 1000      &#x03BC; L  /  m  = 90
      &#x03BC; L  /  m    {\displaystyle \mathrm {\frac {9\,{\rm {L}}}{100\,
      {\rm {km}}}} =\mathrm {\frac {9\,{\rm {L}}}{100\,{\rm {km}}}} \mathrm
      {\frac {1000000\,{\rm {\mu L}}}{1\,{\rm {L}}}} \mathrm {\frac {1\,{\rm
      {km}}}{1000\,{\rm {m}}}} ={\frac {9\times 1000000}{100\times
      1000}}\,\mathrm {\mu L/m} =90\,\mathrm {\mu L/m} }  [{\displaystyle
      \mathrm {\frac {9\,{\rm {L}}}{100\,{\rm {km}}}} =\mathrm {\frac {9\,{\rm
      {L}}}{100\,{\rm {km}}}} \mathrm {\frac {1000000\,{\rm {\mu L}}}{1\,{\rm
      {L}}}} \mathrm {\frac {1\,{\rm {km}}}{1000\,{\rm {m}}}} ={\frac {9\times
      1000000}{100\times 1000}}\,\mathrm {\mu L/m} =90\,\mathrm {\mu L/m} }]
***** Real-world implications[edit] *****
One example of the importance of agreed units is the failure of the NASA Mars
Climate_Orbiter, which was accidentally destroyed on a mission to Mars in
September 1999 instead of entering orbit due to miscommunications about the
value of forces: different computer programs used different units of
measurement (newton versus pound_force). Considerable amounts of effort, time,
and money were wasted.[8][9]
On 15 April 1999, Korean_Air cargo flight_6316 from Shanghai to Seoul was lost
due to the crew confusing tower instructions (in metres) and altimeter readings
(in feet). Three crew and five people on the ground were killed. Thirty-seven
were injured.[10][11]
In 1983, a Boeing 767 (which thanks to its pilot's gliding skills landed safely
and became known as the Gimli_Glider) ran out of fuel in mid-flight because of
two mistakes in figuring the fuel supply of Air_Canada's first aircraft to use
metric measurements.[12] This accident was the result of both confusion due to
the simultaneous use of metric and Imperial measures and confusion of mass and
volume measures.
When planning his journey across the Atlantic Ocean in the 1480s, Columbus
mistakenly assumed that the mile referred to in the Arabic estimate of 56â
miles for the size of a degree was the same as the actually much shorter
Italian mile of 1,480 meters. His estimate for the size of the degree and for
the circumference of the Earth was therefore about 25% too small.[13]

      said yesterday that its Boeing 767 jet ran out of fuel in mid-flight last
      week because of two mistakes in figuring the fuel supply of the airline's
      first aircraft to use metric measurements. After both engines lost their
      power, the pilots made what is now thought to be the first successful
      emergency dead stick landing of a commercial jetliner.
