A pseudocolor image of two people taken in long-wavelength infrared (body-
temperature thermal) light.
This infrared space telescope image has (false-color) blue, green and red
corresponding to 3.4, 4.6, and 12Â Ã‚Âµm wavelengths, respectively.
Infrared radiation (IR), sometimes called infrared light, is electromagnetic
radiation (EMR) with longer wavelengths than those of visible_light, and is
therefore generally invisible to the human eye, although IR at wavelengths up
to 1050Â nanometersÂ (nm)s from specially pulsed lasers can be seen by humans
under certain conditions.[1][2][3][4] IR wavelengths extend from the nominal
red edge of the visible_spectrum at 700Â nanometers (frequency 430Â THz), to
1Â millimeter (300Â GHz).[5] Most of the thermal_radiation emitted by objects
near room temperature is infrared. As with all EMR, IR carries radiant_energy
and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle, the photon.
Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by astronomer Sir William_Herschel,
who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy
than red light, by means of its effect on a thermometer.[6] Slightly more than
half of the total energy from the Sun was eventually found to arrive on Earth
in the form of infrared. The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared
radiation has a critical effect on Earth's climate.
Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their
rotational-vibrational movements. It excites vibrational modes in a molecule
through a change in the dipole_moment, making it a useful frequency range for
study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry. Infrared
spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared
range.[7]
Infrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, military, law
enforcement, and medical applications. Night-vision devices using active near-
infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the
observer being detected. Infrared_astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to
penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular_clouds, detect objects such
as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the
universe.[8] Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in
insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect
overheating of electrical apparatus.
Extensive uses for military and civilian applications include target
acquisition, surveillance, night_vision, homing, and tracking. Humans at normal
body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10Â ÃÂ¼m (micrometers).
Non-military uses include thermal_efficiency analysis, environmental
monitoring, industrial facility inspections, detection of grow-ops, remote
temperature sensing, short-range wireless_communication, spectroscopy, and
weather_forecasting.

***** Definition and relationship to the electromagnetic spectrum[edit] *****
Infrared radiation extends from the nominal red edge of the visible_spectrum at
700 nanometers (nm) to 1 millimeter (mm). This range of wavelengths corresponds
to a frequency range of approximately 430Â THz down to 300Â GHz. Below infrared
is the microwave portion of the electromagnetic_spectrum.

***** Natural infrared[edit] *****
Sunlight, at an effective temperature of 5,780 Kelvin (9,944Ã‚Â° Fahrenheit), is
composed of near-thermal-spectrum radiation that is slightly more than half
infrared. At zenith, sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1Â kilowatt
per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 527 watts is infrared radiation,
445 watts is visible_light, and 32 watts is ultraviolet radiation.[10] Nearly
all the infrared radiation in sunlight is near infrared, shorter than 4
micrometers.
On the surface of Earth, at far lower temperatures than the surface of the Sun,
some thermal radiation consists of infrared in the mid-infrared region, much
longer than in sunlight. However, black body or thermal radiation is
continuous: it gives off radiation at all wavelengths. Of these natural thermal
radiation processes, only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce
much visible energy, and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light
energy.[11]
***** Regions within the infrared[edit] *****
In general, objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths,
but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because
sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth. Thermal
infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength, which is inversely
proportional to the absolute temperature of object, in accordance with Wien's
displacement_law.
Therefore, the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections.
**** Commonly used sub-division scheme[edit] ****
A commonly used sub-division scheme is:[12]

A comparison of a thermal image (top) and an ordinary photograph (bottom) shows
that a trash bag is transparent, but glass (the man's spectacles) is opaque in
long-wavelength infrared.
NIR and SWIR is sometimes called "reflected infrared", whereas MWIR and LWIR is
sometimes referred to as "thermal infrared". Due to the nature of the blackbody
radiation curves, typical "hot" objects, such as exhaust pipes, often appear
brighter in the MW compared to the same object viewed in the LW.
**** CIE division scheme[edit] ****
The International_Commission_on_Illumination (CIE) recommended the division of
infrared radiation into the following three bands:[15]
Abbreviation Wavelength                Frequency
IR-A         700Â nm Ã¢Â€Â“ 1400Â nm   215Â THz Ã¢Â€Â“ 430Â THz
             (0.7Â Ã‚Âµm Ã¢Â€Â“ 1.4Â Ã‚Âµm)
IR-B         1400Â nm Ã¢Â€Â“ 3000Â nm  100Â THz Ã¢Â€Â“ 215Â THz
             (1.4Â Ã‚Âµm Ã¢Â€Â“ 3Â Ã‚Âµm)
IR-C         3000Â nm Ã¢Â€Â“ 1Â mm     300Â GHz Ã¢Â€Â“ 100Â THz
             (3Â Ã‚Âµm Ã¢Â€Â“ 1000Â Ã‚Âµm)
**** ISO 20473 scheme[edit] ****
ISO 20473 specifies the following scheme:[16]
Designation   Abbreviation Wavelength
Near-Infrared NIR          0.78Ã¢Â€Â“3Â Ã‚Âµm
Mid-Infrared  MIR          3Ã¢Â€Â“50Â Ã‚Âµm
Far-Infrared  FIR          50Ã¢Â€Â“1000Â Ã‚Âµm
**** Astronomy division scheme[edit] ****
Astronomers typically divide the infrared spectrum as follows:[17]
Designation   Abbreviation Wavelength
Near-Infrared NIR          (0.7Ã¢Â€Â“1) to 5Â Ã‚Âµm
Mid-Infrared  MIR          5 to (25Ã¢Â€Â“40)Â Ã‚Âµm
Far-Infrared  FIR          (25Ã¢Â€Â“40) to (200Ã¢Â€Â“350)Â Ã‚Âµm.
These divisions are not precise and can vary depending on the publication. The
three regions are used for observation of different temperature ranges, and
hence different environments in space.
The most common photometric system used in astronomy allocates capital letters
to_different_spectral_regions according to filters used; I, J, H, and K cover
the near-infrared wavelengths; L, M, N, and Q refer to the mid-infrared region.
These letters are commonly understood in reference to atmospheric_windows and
appear, for instance, in the titles of many papers.
**** Sensor response division scheme[edit] ****
Plot of atmospheric transmittance in part of the infrared region
A third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various detectors:
[18]
    * Near-infrared: from 0.7 to 1.0Â Ã‚Âµm (from the approximate end of the
      response of the human eye to that of silicon).
    * Short-wave infrared: 1.0 to 3Â Ã‚Âµm (from the cut-off of silicon to that of
      the MWIR atmospheric window). InGaAs covers to about 1.8Â Ã‚Âµm; the less
      sensitive lead salts cover this region.
    * Mid-wave infrared: 3 to 5Â Ã‚Âµm (defined by the atmospheric window and
      covered by indium_antimonide [InSb] and mercury_cadmium_telluride
      [HgCdTe] and partially by lead_selenide [PbSe]).
    * Long-wave infrared: 8 to 12, or 7 to 14Â Ã‚Âµm (this is the atmospheric
      window covered by HgCdTe and microbolometers).
    * Very-long wave infrared (VLWIR) (12 to about 30Â Ã‚Âµm, covered by doped
      silicon).
Near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable
by the human eye. mid- and far-infrared are progressively further from the
visible_spectrum. Other definitions follow different physical mechanisms
(emission peaks, vs. bands, water absorption) and the newest follow technical
reasons (the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050Â nm, while
InGaAs's sensitivity starts around 950Â nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600Â nm,
depending on the specific configuration). No international standards for these
specifications are currently available.
The onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various
values typically between 700Â nm and 800Â nm, but the boundary between visible
and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye is markedly less
sensitive to light above 700Â nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make
insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources.
However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED
sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored
gels) can be detected up to approximately 780Â nm, and will be perceived as red
light. Intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050Â nm can be
seen as a dull red glow, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of
scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect
illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all
visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given
a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque
IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the Wood_effect that
consists of IR-glowing foliage.[19]
**** Telecommunication bands in the infrared[edit] ****
In optical_communications, the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is
divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting/
absorbing materials (fibers) and detectors:[20]
Band   Descriptor           Wavelength range
O band Original             1260Ã¢Â€Â“1360Â nm
E band Extended             1360Ã¢Â€Â“1460Â nm
S band Short wavelength     1460Ã¢Â€Â“1530Â nm
C_band Conventional         1530Ã¢Â€Â“1565Â nm
L band Long wavelength      1565Ã¢Â€Â“1625Â nm
U band Ultralong wavelength 1625Ã¢Â€Â“1675Â nm
The C-band is the dominant band for long-distance telecommunication networks.
The S and L bands are based on less well established technology, and are not as
widely deployed.
***** Heat[edit] *****
Main article: Thermal_radiation
Materials with higher emissivity appear to be hotter. In this thermal image,
the ceramic cylinder appears to be hotter than its cubic container (made of
silicon carbide), while in fact, they have the same temperature.
Infrared radiation is popularly known as "heat radiation",[21] but light and
electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them.
Infrared light from the Sun accounts for 49%[22] of the heating of Earth, with
the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at
longer wavelengths. Visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper
and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation. Objects at room
temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25Â Ã‚Âµm band,
but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent
objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects (see black_body and Wien's
displacement_law).[23]
Heat is energy in transit that flows due to a temperature difference. Unlike
heat transmitted by thermal_conduction or thermal_convection, thermal radiation
can propagate through a vacuum. Thermal radiation is characterized by a
particular spectrum of many wavelengths that are associated with emission from
an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature.
Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very
high temperatures such radiation is associated with spectra far above the
infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (e.g. the
solar_corona). Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal
radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low)
temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.
The concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions
of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal
emissions deviate from the idea of a black_body. To further explain, two
objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image
if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any pre-set emissivity
value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a
lower emissivity will appear cooler. For that reason, incorrect selection of
emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and
pyrometers.

**** Night vision[edit] ****
Main article: Night_vision
Active-infrared night vision: the camera illuminates the scene at infrared
wavelengths invisible to the human_eye. Despite a dark back-lit scene, active-
infrared night vision delivers identifying details, as seen on the display
monitor.
Infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible
light to see.[24] Night_vision_devices operate through a process involving the
conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a
chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light.[24]
Infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for
conversion by night vision devices, increasing in-the-dark visibility without
actually using a visible light source.[24]
The use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with
thermal_imaging, which creates images based on differences in surface
temperature by detecting infrared radiation (heat) that emanates from objects
and their surrounding environment.[25]
**** Thermography[edit] ****
Thermography helped to determine the temperature profile of the Space_Shuttle
thermal_protection_system during re-entry.
Main article: Thermography
Infrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects
(if the emissivity is known). This is termed thermography, or in the case of
very hot objects in the NIR or visible it is termed pyrometry. Thermography
(thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial applications but
the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on
cars due to the massively reduced production costs.
Thermographic_cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the
electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900Ã¢Â€Â“14,000 nanometers or 0.9Ã¢Â€Â“14Â ÃÂ¼m) and
produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all
objects based on their temperatures, according to the black body radiation law,
thermography makes it possible to "see" one's environment with or without
visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases
with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in
temperature (hence the name).
**** Hyperspectral imaging[edit] ****
Main article: Hyperspectral_imaging
Hyperspectral thermal infrared emission measurement, an outdoor scan in winter
conditions, ambient temperature Ã¢ÂˆÂ’15Â Ã‚Â°C, image produced with a Specim LWIR
hyperspectral imager. Relative radiance spectra from various targets in the
image are shown with arrows. The infrared_spectra of the different objects such
as the watch clasp have clearly distinctive characteristics. The contrast level
indicates the temperature of the object.[26]
Infrared light from the LED of a remote_control as recorded by a digital
camera.
A hyperspectral image is a "picture" containing continuous spectrum through a
wide spectral range at each pixel. Hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance
in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and
LWIR spectral regions. Typical applications include biological, mineralogical,
defence, and industrial measurements.
Thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a
Thermographic_camera, with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains
a full LWIR spectrum. Consequently, chemical identification of the object can
be performed without a need for an external light source such as the sun or the
moon. Such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements, outdoor
surveillance and UAV applications.[27]
**** Other imaging[edit] ****
In infrared_photography, infrared_filters are used to capture the near-infrared
spectrum. Digital_cameras often use infrared blockers. Cheaper digital cameras
and camera_phones have less effective filters and can "see" intense near-
infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially
pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near
a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image.
There is also a technique called 'T-ray' imaging, which is imaging using far-
infrared or terahertz_radiation. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz
photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques.
Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new
developments such as terahertz_time-domain_spectroscopy.

appearance as the wavelength of light changes.
**** Tracking[edit] ****
Main article: Infrared_homing
Infrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a passive_missile
guidance_system, which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic
radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it. Missiles that use
infrared seeking are often referred to as "heat-seekers" since infrared (IR) is
just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly
by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines, and aircraft
generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared
wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.[28]
**** Heating[edit] ****

Infrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source. For example, it
is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants. It may also be used in other
heating applications, such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft (de-
icing).[29] Infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it
predominantly heats the opaque, absorbent objects, rather than the air around
them.
Infrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing
processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic
welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace
convection ovens and contact heating.
Efficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the
absorption characteristics of the material.
**** Cooling[edit] ****
Main article: Radiative_cooling
A variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared
emissions to cool buildings or other systems. The LWIR (8Ã¢Â€Â“15Â Ã‚Âµm) region is
especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into
space through the atmosphere.
**** Communications[edit] ****
Further information: Consumer_IR
IR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among
computer peripherals and personal_digital_assistants. These devices usually
conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association. Remote
controls and IrDA devices use infrared light-emitting_diodes (LEDs) to emit
infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam. The
beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, to prevent interference from other
sources of infrared (like sunlight or artificial lighting). The receiver uses a
silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric_current. It
responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and
filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared
communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density.
IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in
adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for remote_controls to command
appliances. Infrared remote control protocols like RC-5, SIRC, are used to
communicate with infrared.
Free_space_optical_communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively
inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at
up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable, except
for the radiation damage. "Since the eye cannot detect IR, blinking or closing
the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen."[30]
Infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical_fiber communications
systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330Â nm (least dispersion) or
1,550Â nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard silica fibers.
IR data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being
researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the RIAS_(Remote
Infrared_Audible_Signage) project. Transmitting IR data from one device to
another is sometimes referred to as beaming.
**** Spectroscopy[edit] ****
Infrared_vibrational_spectroscopy (see also near-infrared_spectroscopy) is a
technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their
constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency
characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may
have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions
of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the
molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The
vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of
infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic_compounds
using light radiation from 4000Ã¢Â€Â“400Â cmÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of
all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to
gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups
present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-
H absorption around 3200Â cmÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1). The unit for expressing radiation in this
application, cmÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1, is the spectroscopic wavenumber. It is the frequency
divided by the speed of light in vacuum.
**** Thin film metrology[edit] ****
In the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize
materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures. By measuring the
reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of
refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the
Forouhi-Bloomer_dispersion_equations. The reflectance from the infrared light
can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle
of high aspect ratio trench structures.
**** Meteorology[edit] ****
IR Satellite picture taken 1315 Z on 15 October 2006. A frontal system can be
seen in the Gulf_of_Mexico with embedded Cumulonimbus cloud. Shallower Cumulus
and Stratocumulus can be seen off the Eastern_Seaboard.
Weather_satellites equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or
infrared images, which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud
heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to
locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range
10.3Ã¢Â€Â“12.5Â Ã‚Âµm (IR4 and IR5 channels).
High, cold ice clouds such as Cirrus or Cumulonimbus show up bright white,
lower warmer clouds such as Stratus or Stratocumulus show up as grey with
intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-
grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as
stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea
surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of
the IR4 channel (10.3Ã¢Â€Â“11.5Â Ã‚Âµm) and the near-infrared channel
(1.58Ã¢Â€Â“1.64Â Ã‚Âµm), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a fog satellite
picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at
night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.
These infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents
such as the Gulf Stream, which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen
and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect
their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even El_NiÃƒÂ±o
phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray-shaded
thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired
information.
The main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08Â Ã‚Âµm can be imaged by some weather
satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.
**** Climatology[edit] ****
In the field of climatology, atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to
detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere.
These trends provide information on long-term changes in Earth's climate. It is
one of the primary parameters studied in research into global_warming, together
with solar_radiation.
Schematic of the greenhouse_effect
A pyrgeometer is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous
outdoor measurements. This is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity
for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5Â Ã‚Âµm and 50Â Ã‚Âµm.
**** Astronomy[edit] ****
Main articles: Infrared_astronomy and far-infrared_astronomy
Beta_Pictoris with its planet Beta Pictoris b, the light-blue dot off-center,
as seen in infrared. It combines two images, the inner disc is at 3.6Â Ã‚Âµm.
Astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid state
digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of optical
astronomy. To form an image, the components of an infrared telescope need to be
carefully shielded from heat sources, and the detectors are chilled using
liquid helium.
The sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by
water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared
radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric_windows. This
limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at
a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an
aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space
is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.
The infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for
astronomers. Cold, dark molecular_clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will
glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared can
also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light.
Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so
nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected. (In the
visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected
light from a planet.)
Infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active_galaxies, which
are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high redshift will
have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths, so
they are more readily observed in the infrared.[8]
**** Infrared cleaning[edit] ****
Infrared_cleaning is a technique used by some motion_picture_film_scanners,
film_scanners and flatbed_scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and
scratches upon the finished scan. It works by collecting an additional infrared
channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible
color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination
with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust.
Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by
inpainting.[31]
**** Art conservation and analysis[edit] ****
The_Arnolfini_Portrait by Jan_van_Eyck, National_Gallery,_London
[Infrared_reflectography-en.svg]
Infrared_reflectographyÂ [fr; it; es], as called by art conservators,[32] can be
applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-
destructive manner, in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the
artist as a guide. This often reveals the artist's use of carbon_black, which
shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the
ground underlying the whole painting. Art conservators are looking to see
whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in
between Ã¢Â€Â“ such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original
artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the
prime_version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered
by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti the more
likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also gives useful insights
into working practices.[33]
Among many other changes in the Arnolfini_Portrait of 1434 (left), the man's
face was originally higher by about the height of his eye; the woman's was
higher, and her eyes looked more to the front. Each of his feet was underdrawn
in one position, painted in another, and then overpainted in a third. These
alterations are seen in infrared reflectograms.[34]
Recent progress in the design of infrared sensitive cameras made it possible to
discover and depict not only underpaintings and pentimenti but entire paintings
which were later overpainted by the artist.[35] Notable examples are Picasso's
Woman_Ironing and Blue_Room, where in both cases, a portrait of a man has been
made visible under the painting as it is known today.
Similar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various
types of objects, especially very old written documents such as the Dead_Sea
Scrolls, the Roman works in the Villa_of_the_Papyri, and the Silk Road texts
found in the Dunhuang_Caves.[36] Carbon black used in ink can show up extremely
well.
**** Biological systems[edit] ****
Further information: Infrared_sensing_in_snakes
Thermographic image of a snake eating a mouse
The pit_viper has a pair of infrared sensory pits on its head. There is
uncertainty regarding the exact thermal sensitivity of this biological infrared
detection system.[37][38]
Other organisms that have thermoreceptive organs are pythons (family
Pythonidae), some boas (family Boidae), the Common_Vampire_Bat (Desmodus
rotundus), a variety of jewel_beetles (Melanophila_acuminata),[39] darkly
pigmented butterflies (Pachliopta_aristolochiae and Troides_rhadamantus
plateni), and possibly blood-sucking bugs (Triatoma_infestans).[40]
Some fungi like Venturia_inaequalis require near-infrared light for ejection
[41]
Although near-infrared vision (780Ã¢Â€Â“1000Â nm) has long been deemed impossible
due to noise in visual pigments,[42] sensation of near-infrared light was
reported in the common carp and in three cichlid species.[42][43][44][45][46]
Fish use NIR to capture prey[42] and for phototactic swimming orientation.[46]
NIR sensation in fish may be relevant under poor lighting conditions during
twilight[42] and in turbid surface waters.[46]
**** Photobiomodulation[edit] ****
Near-infrared light, or photobiomodulation, is used for treatment of
chemotherapy-induced oral ulceration as well as wound healing. There is some
work relating to anti-herpes virus treatment.[47] Research projects include
work on central nervous system healing effects via cytochrome c oxidase
upregulation and other possible mechanisms.[48]
**** Health hazards[edit] ****
Strong infrared radiation in certain industry high-heat settings may be
hazardous to the eyes, resulting in damage or blindness to the user. Since the
radiation is invisible, special IR-proof goggles must be worn in such places.

The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William_Herschel, the
astronomer, in the early 19th century. Herschel published his results in 1800
before the Royal_Society_of_London. Herschel used a prism to refract light from
the sun and detected the infrared, beyond the red part of the spectrum, through
an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer. He was surprised at
the result and called them "Calorific Rays".[50][51] The term 'Infrared' did
not appear until late 19th century.[52]
