Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the accumulation or
deposition of small particles and subsequent cementation of mineral or organic
particles on the floor of oceans or other bodies of water at the Earth's
surface. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause these
particles to settle in place. The particles that form a sedimentary rock are
called sediment, and may be composed of geological_detritus (minerals) or
biological_detritus (organic matter). Before being deposited, the geological
detritus was formed by weathering and erosion from the source area, and then
transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass_movement or
glaciers, which are called agents of denudation. Biological detritus was formed
by bodies and parts (mainly shells) of dead aquatic organisms, as well as their
fecal mass, suspended in water and slowly piling up on the floor of water
bodies (marine_snow). Sedimentation may also occur as dissolved minerals
precipitate from water solution.
The sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the Earth's_crust is extensive
(73% of the Earth's current land surface[1]), but the total contribution of
sedimentary rocks is estimated to be only 8% of the total volume of the crust.
[2] Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of
igneous and metamorphic_rocks. Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as
strata, forming a structure called bedding. The study of sedimentary rocks and
rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil
engineering, for example in the construction of roads, houses, tunnels, canals
or other structures. Sedimentary rocks are also important sources of natural
resources like coal, fossil_fuels, drinking_water or ores.
The study of the sequence of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for an
understanding of the Earth's_history, including palaeogeography,
paleoclimatology and the history_of_life. The scientific_discipline that
studies the properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentology.
Sedimentology is part of both geology and physical_geography and overlaps
partly with other disciplines in the Earth_sciences, such as pedology,
geomorphology, geochemistry and structural_geology. Sedimentary rocks have also
been found on Mars.

***** Classification based on origin *****
Uluru (Ayers Rock) is a large sandstone formation in Northern_Territory,
Australia.
Sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into four groups based on the processes
responsible for their formation: clastic sedimentary rocks, biochemical
(biogenic) sedimentary rocks, chemical sedimentary rocks, and a fourth category
for "other" sedimentary rocks formed by impacts, volcanism, and other minor
processes.
**** Clastic sedimentary rocks ****
Main article: Clastic_rock
Claystone deposited in Glacial_Lake_Missoula, Montana, United_States. Note the
very fine and flat bedding, common for deposits coming from lake beds further
away from the source of sediment.
Clastic sedimentary rocks are composed of other rock fragments that were
cemented by silicate minerals. Clastic rocks are composed largely of quartz,
feldspar, rock (lithic) fragments, clay_minerals, and mica; any type of mineral
may be present, but they in general represent the minerals that exist locally.
Clastic sedimentary rocks, are subdivided according to the dominant particle
size. Most geologists use the Udden-Wentworth grain size scale and divide
unconsolidated sediment into three fractions: gravel (>2 mm diameter), sand (1/
16 to 2 mm diameter), and mud (clay is <1/256 mm and silt is between 1/16 and
1/256 mm). The classification of clastic sedimentary rocks parallels this
scheme; conglomerates and breccias are made mostly of gravel, sandstones are
made mostly of sand, and mudrocks are made mostly of the finest material. This
tripartite subdivision is mirrored by the broad categories of rudites,
arenites, and lutites, respectively, in older literature.
The subdivision of these three broad categories is based on differences in
clast shape (conglomerates and breccias), composition (sandstones), grain size
or texture (mudrocks).
*** Conglomerates and breccias ***
Conglomerates are dominantly composed of rounded gravel, while breccias are
composed of dominantly angular gravel.
*** Sandstones ***
Sedimentary rock with sandstone in Malta
Lower_Antelope_Canyon was carved out of the surrounding sandstone by both
mechanical weathering and chemical weathering. Wind, sand, and water from flash
flooding are the primary weathering agents.
Sandstone classification schemes vary widely, but most geologists have adopted
the Dott scheme,[3] which uses the relative abundance of quartz, feldspar, and
lithic framework grains and the abundance of a muddy matrix between the larger
grains.
      Composition of framework grains
      The relative abundance of sand-sized framework grains determines the
      first word in a sandstone name. Naming depends on the dominance of the
      three most abundant components quartz, feldspar, or the lithic fragments
      that originated from other rocks. All other minerals are considered
      accessories and not used in the naming of the rock, regardless of
      abundance.
                * Quartz sandstones have >90% quartz grains
                * Feldspathic sandstones have <90% quartz grains and more
                  feldspar grains than lithic grains
                * Lithic sandstones have <90% quartz grains and more lithic
                  grains than feldspar grains
      Abundance of muddy matrix material between sand grains
            When sand-sized particles are deposited, the space between the
            grains either remains open or is filled with mud (silt and/or clay
            sized particle).
                * "Clean" sandstones with open pore space (that may later be
                  filled with matrix material) are called arenites.
                * Muddy sandstones with abundant (>10%) muddy matrix are called
                  wackes.
Six sandstone names are possible using the descriptors for grain composition
(quartz-, feldspathic-, and lithic-) and the amount of matrix (wacke or
arenite). For example, a quartz arenite would be composed of mostly (>90%)
quartz grains and have little or no clayey matrix between the grains, a lithic
wacke would have abundant lithic grains and abundant muddy matrix, etc.
Although the Dott classification scheme[3] is widely used by sedimentologists,
common names like greywacke, arkose, and quartz sandstone are still widely used
by non-specialists and in popular literature.
*** Mudrocks ***
Mudrocks are sedimentary rocks composed of at least 50% silt- and clay-sized
particles. These relatively fine-grained particles are commonly transported by
turbulent_flow in water or air, and deposited as the flow calms and the
particles settle out of suspension.
Most authors presently use the term "mudrock" to refer to all rocks composed
dominantly of mud.[4][5][6][7] Mudrocks can be divided into siltstones,
composed dominantly of silt-sized particles; mudstones with subequal mixture of
silt- and clay-sized particles; and claystones, composed mostly of clay-sized
particles.[4][5] Most authors use "shale" as a term for a fissile mudrock
(regardless of grain size) although some older literature uses the term "shale"
as a synonym for mudrock.
**** Biochemical sedimentary rocks ****
Outcrop of Ordovician oil_shale (kukersite), northern Estonia
Biochemical sedimentary rocks are created when organisms use materials
dissolved in air or water to build their tissue. Examples include:
    * Most types of limestone are formed from the calcareous skeletons of
      organisms such as corals, mollusks, and foraminifera.
    * Coal, formed from plants that have removed carbon from the atmosphere and
      combined it with other elements to build their tissue.
    * Deposits of chert formed from the accumulation of siliceous skeletons of
      microscopic organisms such as radiolaria and diatoms.
**** Chemical sedimentary rocks ****
Chemical sedimentary rock forms when mineral constituents in solution become
supersaturated and inorganically precipitate. Common chemical sedimentary rocks
include oolitic_limestone and rocks composed of evaporite minerals, such as
halite (rock salt), sylvite, barite and gypsum.
**** "Other" sedimentary rocks ****
This fourth miscellaneous category includes rocks formed by Pyroclastic_flows,
impact_breccias, volcanic_breccias, and other relatively uncommon processes.
***** Classification based on composition *****

limestone in Lebanon.
Alternatively, sedimentary rocks can be subdivided into compositional groups
based on their mineralogy:
    * Siliciclastic_sedimentary_rocks, are dominantly composed of silicate
      minerals. The sediment that makes up these rocks was transported as bed
      load, suspended_load, or by sediment_gravity_flows. Siliciclastic
      sedimentary rocks are subdivided into conglomerates and breccias,
      sandstone, and mudrocks.
    * Carbonate_sedimentary_rocks are composed of calcite (rhombohedral CaCO
      3), aragonite (orthorhombic CaCO
      3), dolomite (CaMg(CO
      3)
      2), and other carbonate minerals based on the CO2â
      3 ion. Common examples include limestone and the rock dolomite.
    * Evaporite_sedimentary_rocks are composed of minerals formed from the
      evaporation of water. The most common evaporite minerals are carbonates
      (calcite and others based on CO2â
      3), chlorides (halite and others built on Clâ
      ), and sulfates (gypsum and others built on SO2â
      4). Evaporite rocks commonly include abundant halite (rock salt), gypsum,
      and anhydrite.
    * Organic-rich_sedimentary_rocks have significant amounts of organic
      material, generally in excess of 3% total organic carbon. Common examples
      include coal, oil_shale as well as source_rocks for oil and natural gas.
    * Siliceous_sedimentary_rocks are almost entirely composed of silica (SiO
      2), typically as chert, opal, chalcedony or other microcrystalline forms.
    * Iron-rich_sedimentary_rocks are composed of >15% iron; the most common
      forms are banded_iron_formations and ironstones.[5]
    * Phosphatic_sedimentary_rocks are composed of phosphate minerals and
      contain more than 6.5% phosphorus; examples include deposits of phosphate
      nodules, bone beds, and phosphatic mudrocks.[6]
***** Deposition and transformation *****
**** Sediment transport and deposition ****
Cross-bedding and scour in a fine sandstone; the Logan_Formation
(Mississippian) of Jackson County, Ohio
Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediment is deposited out of air, ice, wind,
gravity, or water flows carrying the particles in suspension. This sediment is
often formed when weathering and erosion break down a rock into loose material
in a source area. The material is then transported from the source area to the
deposition area. The type of sediment transported depends on the geology of the
hinterland (the source area of the sediment). However, some sedimentary rocks,
such as evaporites, are composed of material that form at the place of
deposition. The nature of a sedimentary rock, therefore, not only depends on
the sediment supply, but also on the sedimentary_depositional_environment in
which it formed.
**** Transformation (Diagenesis) ****
Pressure_solution at work in a clastic_rock. While material dissolves at places
where grains are in contact, that material may recrystallize from the solution
and act as cement in open pore spaces. As a result, there is a net flow of
material from areas under high stress to those under low stress, producing a
sedimentary rock that is more compact and harder. Loose sand can become
sandstone in this way.
Main article: diagenesis
The term diagenesis is used to describe all the chemical, physical, and
biological changes, exclusive of surface weathering, undergone by a sediment
after its initial deposition. Some of those processes cause the sediment to
consolidate into a compact, solid substance from the originally loose material.
Young sedimentary rocks, especially those of Quaternary age (the most recent
period of the geologic_time_scale) are often still unconsolidated. As sediment
deposition builds up, the overburden_(lithostatic)_pressure rises, and a
process known as lithification takes place.
Sedimentary rocks are often saturated with seawater or groundwater, in which
minerals can dissolve, or from which minerals can precipitate. Precipitating
minerals reduce the pore_space in a rock, a process called cementation. Due to
the decrease in pore space, the original connate_fluids are expelled. The
precipitated minerals form a cement and make the rock more compact and
competent. In this way, loose clasts in a sedimentary rock can become "glued"
together.
When sedimentation continues, an older rock layer becomes buried deeper as a
result. The lithostatic pressure in the rock increases due to the weight of the
overlying sediment. This causes compaction, a process in which grains
mechanically reorganize. Compaction is, for example, an important diagenetic
process in clay, which can initially consist of 60% water. During compaction,
this interstitial water is pressed out of pore spaces. Compaction can also be
the result of dissolution of grains by pressure_solution. The dissolved
material precipitates again in open pore spaces, which means there is a net
flow of material into the pores. However, in some cases, a certain mineral
dissolves and does not precipitate again. This process, called leaching,
increases pore space in the rock.
Some biochemical processes, like the activity of bacteria, can affect minerals
in a rock and are therefore seen as part of diagenesis. Fungi and plants (by
their roots) and various other organisms that live beneath the surface can also
influence diagenesis.
Burial of rocks due to ongoing sedimentation leads to increased pressure and
temperature, which stimulates certain chemical reactions. An example is the
reactions by which organic_material becomes lignite or coal. When temperature
and pressure increase still further, the realm of diagenesis makes way for
metamorphism, the process that forms metamorphic_rock.
***** Properties *****

layers with iron(III)_oxide (red) and iron(II)_oxide (grey). BIFs were mostly
formed during the Precambrian, when the atmosphere was not yet rich in oxygen.
Moories_Group, Barberton_Greenstone_Belt, South_Africa
**** Color ****
The color of a sedimentary rock is often mostly determined by iron, an element
with two major oxides: iron(II)_oxide and iron(III)_oxide. Iron(II) oxide (FeO)
only forms under low oxygen (anoxic) circumstances and gives the rock a grey or
greenish colour. Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) in a richer oxygen environment is
often found in the form of the mineral hematite and gives the rock a reddish to
brownish colour. In arid continental climates rocks are in direct contact with
the atmosphere, and oxidation is an important process, giving the rock a red or
orange colour. Thick sequences of red sedimentary rocks formed in arid climates
are called red_beds. However, a red colour does not necessarily mean the rock
formed in a continental environment or arid climate.[8]
The presence of organic material can colour a rock black or grey. Organic
material is formed from dead organisms, mostly plants. Normally, such material
eventually decays by oxidation or bacterial activity. Under anoxic
circumstances, however, organic material cannot decay and leaves a dark
sediment, rich in organic material. This can, for example, occur at the bottom
of deep seas and lakes. There is little water mixing in such environments; as a
result, oxygen from surface water is not brought down, and the deposited
sediment is normally a fine dark clay. Dark rocks, rich in organic material,
are therefore often shales.[8][9]
**** Texture ****
Diagram showing well-sorted (left) and poorly sorted (right) grains
The size, form and orientation of clasts (the original pieces of rock) in a
sediment is called its texture. The texture is a small-scale property of a
rock, but determines many of its large-scale properties, such as the density,
porosity or permeability.[10]
The 3D orientation of the clasts is called the fabric of the rock. Between the
clasts, the rock can be composed of a matrix (a cement) that consists of
crystals of one or more precipitated minerals. The size and form of clasts can
be used to determine the velocity and direction of current in the sedimentary
environment that moved the clasts from their origin; fine, calcareous_mud only
settles in quiet water while gravel and larger clasts are moved only by rapidly
moving water.[11][12] The grain size of a rock is usually expressed with the
Wentworth_scale, though alternative scales are sometimes used. The grain size
can be expressed as a diameter or a volume, and is always an average value â
a rock is composed of clasts with different sizes. The statistical_distribution
of grain sizes is different for different rock types and is described in a
property called the sorting of the rock. When all clasts are more or less of
the same size, the rock is called 'well-sorted', and when there is a large
spread in grain size, the rock is called 'poorly sorted'.[13][14]
Diagram showing the rounding and sphericity of grains
The form of the clasts can reflect the origin of the rock.
Coquina, a rock composed of clasts of broken shells, can only form in energetic
water. The form of a clast can be described by using four parameters:[15][16]
    * Surface texture describes the amount of small-scale relief of the surface
      of a grain that is too small to influence the general shape.
    * rounding describes the general smoothness of the shape of a grain.
    * 'Sphericity' describes the degree to which the grain approaches a sphere.
    * 'Grain_form' describes the three dimensional shape of the grain.
Chemical sedimentary rocks have a non-clastic texture, consisting entirely of
crystals. To describe such a texture, only the average size of the crystals and
the fabric are necessary.

Emerald Creek, Idaho 9. Olivine sand from Papakolea, Hawaii. [1]
Most sedimentary rocks contain either quartz (especially siliciclastic rocks)
or calcite (especially carbonate_rocks). In contrast to igneous and metamorphic
rocks, a sedimentary rock usually contains very few different major minerals.
However, the origin of the minerals in a sedimentary rock is often more complex
than in an igneous rock. Minerals in a sedimentary rock can have formed by
precipitation during sedimentation or by diagenesis. In the second case, the
mineral precipitate can have grown over an older generation of cement.[17] A
complex diagenetic history can be studied by optical_mineralogy, using a
petrographic_microscope.
Carbonate rocks dominantly consist of carbonate minerals such as calcite,
aragonite or dolomite. Both the cement and the clasts (including fossils and
ooids) of a carbonate sedimentary rock can consist of carbonate minerals. The
mineralogy of a clastic rock is determined by the material supplied by the
source area, the manner of its transport to the place of deposition and the
stability of that particular mineral. The resistance of rock-forming minerals
to weathering is expressed by Bowen's_reaction_series. In this series, quartz
is the most stable, followed by feldspar, micas, and finally other less stable
minerals that are only present when little weathering has occurred.[18] The
amount of weathering depends mainly on the distance to the source area, the
local climate and the time it took for the sediment to be transported to the
point where it is deposited. In most sedimentary rocks, mica, feldspar and less
stable minerals have been reduced to clay_minerals like kaolinite, illite or
smectite.[clarification_needed]
**** Fossils ****
Fossil-rich layers in a sedimentary rock, AÃ±o_Nuevo_State_Reserve, California
Main articles: fossil and fossilisation
Among the three major types of rock, fossils are most commonly found in
sedimentary rock. Unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks
form at temperatures and pressures that do not destroy fossil remnants. Often
these fossils may only be visible under magnification.
Dead organisms in nature are usually quickly removed by scavengers, bacteria,
rotting and erosion, but sedimentation can contribute to exceptional
circumstances where these natural processes are unable to work, causing
fossilisation. The chance of fossilisation is higher when the sedimentation
rate is high (so that a carcass is quickly buried), in anoxic environments
(where little bacterial activity occurs) or when the organism had a
particularly hard skeleton. Larger, well-preserved fossils are relatively rare.
Burrows in a turbidite, made by crustaceans, San_Vincente_Formation (early
Eocene) of the Ainsa_Basin, southern foreland of the Pyrenees
Fossils can be both the direct remains or imprints of organisms and their
skeletons. Most commonly preserved are the harder parts of organisms such as
bones, shells, and the woody tissue of plants. Soft tissue has a much smaller
chance of being fossilized, and the preservation of soft tissue of animals
older than 40 million years is very rare.[19] Imprints of organisms made while
they were still alive are called trace_fossils, examples of which are burrows,
footprints, etc.
As a part of a sedimentary or metamorphic rock, fossils undergo the same
diagenetic_processes as does the containing rock. A shell consisting of calcite
can, for example, dissolve while a cement of silica then fills the cavity. In
the same way, precipitating minerals can fill cavities formerly occupied by
blood_vessels, vascular_tissue or other soft tissues. This preserves the form
of the organism but changes the chemical composition, a process called
permineralization.[20][21] The most common minerals involved in
permineralization are cements of carbonates (especially calcite), forms of
amorphous_silica (chalcedony, flint, chert) and pyrite. In the case of silica
cements, the process is called lithification.
At high pressure and temperature, the organic_material of a dead organism
undergoes chemical reactions in which volatiles such as water and carbon
dioxide are expulsed. The fossil, in the end, consists of a thin layer of pure
carbon or its mineralized form, graphite. This form of fossilisation is called
carbonisation. It is particularly important for plant fossils.[22] The same
process is responsible for the formation of fossil_fuels like lignite or coal.
**** Primary sedimentary structures ****

Bressay, Shetland_Islands
A flute_cast, a type of sole_marking, from the Book_Cliffs of Utah
Ripple_marks formed by a current in a sandstone that was later tilted
(HaÃberge, Bavaria)
Structures in sedimentary rocks can be divided into 'primary' structures
(formed during deposition) and 'secondary' structures (formed after
deposition). Unlike textures, structures are always large-scale features that
can easily be studied in the field. Sedimentary_structures can indicate
something about the sedimentary environment or can serve to tell which_side
originally_faced_up where tectonics have tilted or overturned sedimentary
layers.
Sedimentary rocks are laid down in layers called beds or strata. A bed is
defined as a layer of rock that has a uniform lithology and texture. Beds form
by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of
beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called bedding.[23][24] Single
beds can be a couple of centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less
pronounced layers are called laminae, and the structure a lamina forms in a
rock is called lamination. Laminae are usually less than a few centimetres
thick.[25] Though bedding and lamination are often originally horizontal in
nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited
at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different
orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called cross-bedding.[26]
Cross-bedding forms when small-scale erosion occurs during deposition, cutting
off part of the beds. Newer beds then form at an angle to older ones.
The opposite of cross-bedding is parallel lamination, where all sedimentary
layering is parallel.[27] Differences in laminations are generally caused by
cyclic changes in the sediment supply, caused, for example, by seasonal changes
in rainfall, temperature or biochemical activity. Laminae that represent
seasonal changes (similar to tree_rings) are called varves. Any sedimentary
rock composed of millimeter or finer scale layers can be named with the general
term laminite. When sedimentary rocks have no lamination at all, their
structural character is called massive bedding.
Graded_bedding is a structure where beds with a smaller grain size occur on top
of beds with larger grains. This structure forms when fast flowing water stops
flowing. Larger, heavier clasts in suspension settle first, then smaller
clasts. Although graded bedding can form in many different environments, it is
a characteristic of turbidity_currents.[28]
The surface of a particular bed, called the bedform, can be indicative of a
particular sedimentary environment, too. Examples of bed forms include dunes
and ripple_marks. Sole markings, such as tool marks and flute casts, are groves
dug into a sedimentary layer that are preserved. These are often elongated
structures and can be used to establish the direction of the flow during
deposition.[29][30]
Ripple marks also form in flowing water. There are two types of ripples:
symmetric and asymmetric. Environments where the current is in one direction,
such as rivers, produce asymmetric ripples. The longer flank of such ripples is
on the upstream side of the current.[31][32][33] Symmetric wave ripples occur
in environments where currents reverse directions, such as tidal flats.
Mudcracks are a bed form caused by the dehydration of sediment that
occasionally comes above the water surface. Such structures are commonly found
at tidal flats or point_bars along rivers.
**** Secondary sedimentary structures ****
Halite crystal mold in dolomite, Paadla Formation (Silurian), Saaremaa, Estonia
Secondary sedimentary structures are those which formed after deposition. Such
structures form by chemical, physical and biological processes within the
sediment. They can be indicators of circumstances after deposition. Some can be
used as way_up_criteria.
Organic materials in a sediment can leave more traces than just fossils.
Preserved tracks and burrows are examples of trace_fossils (also called
ichnofossils).[34] Such traces are relatively rare. Most trace fossils are
burrows of molluscs or arthropods. This burrowing is called bioturbation by
sedimentologists. It can be a valuable indicator of the biological and
ecological environment that existed after the sediment was deposited. On the
other hand, the burrowing activity of organisms can destroy other (primary)
structures in the sediment, making a reconstruction more difficult.
Chert concretions in chalk, Middle_Lefkara_Formation (upper Paleocene to middle
Eocene), Cyprus
Secondary structures can also form by diagenesis or the formation of a soil
(pedogenesis) when a sediment is exposed above the water level. An example of a
diagenetic structure common in carbonate rocks is a stylolite.[35] Stylolites
are irregular planes where material was dissolved into the pore fluids in the
rock. This can result in the precipitation of a certain chemical species
producing colouring and staining of the rock, or the formation of concretions.
Concretions are roughly concentric bodies with a different composition from the
host rock. Their formation can be the result of localized precipitation due to
small differences in composition or porosity of the host rock, such as around
fossils, inside burrows or around plant roots.[36] In carbonate based rocks
such as limestone or chalk, chert or flint concretions are common, while
terrestrial sandstones can have iron concretions. Calcite concretions in clay
are called septarian_concretions.
After deposition, physical processes can deform the sediment, producing a third
class of secondary structures. Density contrasts between different sedimentary
layers, such as between sand and clay, can result in flame_structures or load
casts, formed by inverted diapirism.[37] While the clastic bed is still fluid,
diapirism can cause a denser upper layer to sink into a lower layer. Sometimes,
density contrasts can result or grow when one of the lithologies dehydrates.
Clay can be easily compressed as a result of dehydration, while sand retains
the same volume and becomes relatively less dense. On the other hand, when the
pore_fluid_pressure in a sand layer surpasses a critical point, the sand can
break through overlying clay layers and flow through, forming discordant bodies
of sedimentary rock called sedimentary_dykes. The same process can form mud
volcanoes on the surface where they broke through upper layers.
Sedimentary dykes can also be formed in a cold climate where the soil is
permanently frozen during a large part of the year. Frost weathering can form
cracks in the soil that fill with rubble from above. Such structures can be
used as climate indicators as well as way up structures.[38]
Density contrasts can also cause small-scale faulting, even while sedimentation
progresses (synchronous-sedimentary faulting).[39] Such faulting can also occur
when large masses of non-lithified sediment are deposited on a slope, such as
at the front side of a delta or the continental_slope. Instabilities in such
sediments can result in the deposited material to slump, producing fissures and
folding. The resulting structures in the rock are syn-sedimentary folds and
faults, which can be difficult to distinguish from folds and faults formed by
tectonic forces acting on lithified rocks.
***** Depositional environments *****
Common types of depositional_environments
The swirls of tan, green, blue, and white are sediment in the shallow waters of
the Gulf_of_Mexico off the Yucatan_Peninsula. The blue-green cloud in this
image roughly matches the extent of the shallow continental_shelf west of the
peninsula. This is a perfect example of a shallow marine depositional
environment.
Lac_Gentau reflecting the Pic_du_Midi_d'Ossau (PyrÃ©nÃ©es, France). Lacustrine
environments only make up a small portion of the total depositional
environments.
The setting in which a sedimentary rock forms is called the depositional
environment. Every environment has a characteristic combination of geologic
processes, and circumstances. The type of sediment that is deposited is not
only dependent on the sediment that is transported to a place (provenance), but
also on the environment itself.[40]
A marine environment means that the rock was formed in a sea or ocean. Often, a
distinction is made between deep and shallow marine environments. Deep marine
usually refers to environments more than 200 m below the water surface
(including the abyssal_plain). Shallow marine environments exist adjacent to
coastlines and can extend to the boundaries of the continental_shelf. The water
movements in such environments have a generally higher energy than that in deep
environments, as wave_activity diminishes with depth. This means that coarser
sediment particles can be transported and the deposited sediment can be coarser
than in deeper environments. When the sediment is transported from the
continent, an alternation of sand, clay and silt is deposited. When the
continent is far away, the amount of such sediment deposited may be small, and
biochemical processes dominate the type of rock that forms. Especially in warm
climates, shallow marine environments far offshore mainly see deposition of
carbonate rocks. The shallow, warm water is an ideal habitat for many small
organisms that build carbonate skeletons. When these organisms die, their
skeletons sink to the bottom, forming a thick layer of calcareous mud that may
lithify into limestone. Warm shallow marine environments also are ideal
environments for coral_reefs, where the sediment consists mainly of the
calcareous skeletons of larger organisms.[41]
In deep marine environments, the water current working the sea bottom is small.
Only fine particles can be transported to such places. Typically sediments
depositing on the ocean floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-
organisms. At 4 km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically
(the depth zone where this happens is called the lysocline). Calcareous
sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves; as a result, no limestone
can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica
(such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a
rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When the bottom of the sea has
a small inclination, for example at the continental_slopes, the sedimentary
cover can become unstable, causing turbidity_currents. Turbidity currents are
sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause
the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of
sediment, such as sand and silt. The rock sequence formed by a turbidity
current is called a turbidite.[42]
The coast is an environment dominated by wave action. At a beach, dominantly
denser sediment such as sand or gravel, often mingled with shell fragments, is
deposited, while the silt and clay sized material is kept in mechanical
suspension. Tidal_flats and shoals are places that sometimes dry because of the
tide. They are often cross-cut by gullies, where the current is strong and the
grain size of the deposited sediment is larger. Where rivers enter the body of
water, either on a sea or lake coast, deltas can form. These are large
accumulations of sediment transported from the continent to places in front of
the mouth of the river. Deltas are dominantly composed of clastic sediment (in
contrast to chemical).
A sedimentary rock formed on land has a continental sedimentary environment.
Examples of continental environments are lagoons, lakes, swamps, floodplains
and alluvial_fans. In the quiet water of swamps, lakes and lagoons, fine
sediment is deposited, mingled with organic material from dead plants and
animals. In rivers, the energy of the water is much greater and can transport
heavier clastic material. Besides transport by water, sediment can in
continental environments also be transported by wind or glaciers. Sediment
transported by wind is called aeolian and is always very_well_sorted, while
sediment transported by a glacier is called glacial_till and is characterized
by very poor sorting.[43]
Aeolian deposits can be quite striking. The depositional environment of the
Touchet_Formation, located in the Northwestern_United_States, had intervening
periods of aridity which resulted in a series of rhythmite layers. Erosional
cracks were later infilled with layers of soil material, especially from
aeolian_processes. The infilled sections formed vertical inclusions in the
horizontally deposited layers of the Touchet Formation, and thus provided
evidence of the events that intervened over time among the forty-one layers
that were deposited.[44]
**** Sedimentary facies ****
The typical rock formed in a certain depositional environment is called its
sedimentary_facies. Sedimentary environments usually exist alongside each other
in certain natural successions. A beach, where sand and gravel is deposited, is
usually bounded by a deeper marine environment a little offshore, where finer
sediments are deposited at the same time. Behind the beach, there can be dunes
(where the dominant deposition is well sorted sand) or a lagoon (where fine
clay and organic material is deposited). Every sedimentary environment has its
own characteristic deposits. When sedimentary strata accumulate through time,
the environment can shift, forming a change in facies in the subsurface at one
location. On the other hand, when a rock layer with a certain age is followed
laterally, the lithology (the type of rock) and facies eventually change.[45]
Shifting sedimentary facies in the case of transgression (above) and regression
of the sea (below)
Facies can be distinguished in a number of ways: the most common are by the
lithology (for example: limestone, siltstone or sandstone) or by fossil
content. Coral, for example, only lives in warm and shallow marine environments
and fossils of coral are thus typical for shallow marine facies. Facies
determined by lithology are called lithofacies; facies determined by fossils
are biofacies.[46]
Sedimentary environments can shift their geographical positions through time.
Coastlines can shift in the direction of the sea when the sea_level drops
(regression), when the surface rises (transgression) due to tectonic forces in
the Earth's crust or when a river forms a large delta. In the subsurface, such
geographic shifts of sedimentary environments of the past are recorded in
shifts in sedimentary facies. This means that sedimentary facies can change
either parallel or perpendicular to an imaginary layer of rock with a fixed
age, a phenomenon described by Walther's_Law.[47]
The situation in which coastlines move in the direction of the continent is
called transgression. In the case of transgression, deeper marine facies are
deposited over shallower facies, a succession called onlap. Regression is the
situation in which a coastline moves in the direction of the sea. With
regression, shallower facies are deposited on top of deeper facies, a situation
called offlap.[48]
The facies of all rocks of a certain age can be plotted on a map to give an
overview of the palaeogeography. A sequence of maps for different ages can give
an insight in the development of the regional geography.

***** Sedimentary basins *****
Main article: sedimentary_basin
Plate_tectonics diagram showing convergence of an oceanic plate and a
continental plate. Note the back-arc_basin, forearc_basin, and oceanic_basin.
Places where large-scale sedimentation takes place are called sedimentary
basins. The amount of sediment that can be deposited in a basin depends on the
depth of the basin, the so-called accommodation space. The depth, shape and
size of a basin depend on tectonics, movements within the Earth's lithosphere.
Where the lithosphere moves upward (tectonic_uplift), land eventually rises
above sea level and the area becomes a source for new sediment as erosion
removes material. Where the lithosphere moves downward (tectonic_subsidence), a
basin forms and sediments are deposited.
A type of basin formed by the moving apart of two pieces of a continent is
called a rift_basin. Rift basins are elongated, narrow and deep basins. Due to
divergent movement, the lithosphere is stretched and thinned, so that the hot
asthenosphere rises and heats the overlying rift basin. Apart from continental
sediments, rift basins normally also have part of their infill consisting of
volcanic_deposits. When the basin grows due to continued stretching of the
lithosphere, the rift grows and the sea can enter, forming marine deposits.
When a piece of lithosphere that was heated and stretched cools again, its
density rises, causing isostatic subsidence. If this subsidence continues long
enough, the basin is called a sag_basin. Examples of sag basins are the regions
along passive continental_margins, but sag basins can also be found in the
interior of continents. In sag basins, the extra weight of the newly deposited
sediments is enough to keep the subsidence going in a vicious_circle. The total
thickness of the sedimentary infill in a sag basins can thus exceed 10 km.
A third type of basin exists along convergent_plate_boundaries â places where
one tectonic_plate moves under another into the asthenosphere. The subducting
plate bends and forms a fore-arc_basin in front of the overriding plateâan
elongated, deep asymmetric basin. Fore-arc basins are filled with deep marine
deposits and thick sequences of turbidites. Such infill is called flysch. When
the convergent movement of the two plates results in continental_collision, the
basin becomes shallower and develops into a foreland_basin. At the same time,
tectonic uplift forms a mountain_belt in the overriding plate, from which large
amounts of material are eroded and transported to the basin. Such erosional
material of a growing mountain chain is called molasse and has either a shallow
marine or a continental facies.
At the same time, the growing weight of the mountain belt can cause isostatic
subsidence in the area of the overriding plate on the other side to the
mountain belt. The basin type resulting from this subsidence is called a back-
arc_basin and is usually filled by shallow marine deposits and molasse.[49]

Lyme_Regis, southern England
**** Influence of astronomical cycles ****
In many cases facies changes and other lithological features in sequences of
sedimentary rock have a cyclic nature. This cyclic nature was caused by cyclic
changes in sediment supply and the sedimentary environment. Most of these
cyclic changes are caused by astronomic cycles. Short astronomic cycles can be
the difference between the tides or the spring_tide every two weeks. On a
larger time-scale, cyclic changes in climate and sea level are caused by
Milankovitch_cycles: cyclic changes in the orientation and/or position of the
Earth's rotational axis and orbit around the Sun. There are a number of
Milankovitch cycles known, lasting between 10,000 and 200,000 years.[50]
Relatively small changes in the orientation of the Earth's axis or length of
the seasons can be a major influence on the Earth's climate. An example are the
ice_ages_of_the_past_2.6_million_years (the Quaternary period), which are
assumed to have been caused by astronomic cycles.[51][52] Climate change can
influence the global sea level (and thus the amount of accommodation space in
sedimentary basins) and sediment supply from a certain region. Eventually,
small changes in astronomic parameters can cause large changes in sedimentary
environment and sedimentation.
***** Sedimentation rates *****
The rate at which sediment is deposited differs depending on the location. A
channel in a tidal flat can see the deposition of a few metres of sediment in
one day, while on the deep ocean floor each year only a few millimetres of
sediment accumulate. A distinction can be made between normal sedimentation and
sedimentation caused by catastrophic processes. The latter category includes
all kinds of sudden exceptional processes like mass_movements, rock_slides or
flooding. Catastrophic processes can see the sudden deposition of a large
amount of sediment at once. In some sedimentary environments, most of the total
column of sedimentary rock was formed by catastrophic processes, even though
the environment is usually a quiet place. Other sedimentary environments are
dominated by normal, ongoing sedimentation.[53]
In many cases, sedimentation occurs slowly. In a desert, for example, the wind
deposits siliciclastic material (sand or silt) in some spots, or catastrophic
flooding of a wadi may cause sudden deposits of large quantities of detrital
material, but in most places eolian erosion dominates. The amount of
sedimentary rock that forms is not only dependent on the amount of supplied
material, but also on how well the material consolidates. Erosion removes most
deposited sediment shortly after deposition.[53]

***** Stratigraphy *****
Main article: Stratigraphy
That new rock layers are above older rock layers is stated in the principle_of
superposition. There are usually some gaps in the sequence called
unconformities. These represent periods where no new sediments were laid down,
or when earlier sedimentary layers were raised above sea level and eroded away.
Sedimentary rocks contain important information about the history_of_the_Earth.
They contain fossils, the preserved remains of ancient plants and animals. Coal
is considered a type of sedimentary rock. The composition of sediments provides
us with clues as to the original rock. Differences between successive layers
indicate changes to the environment over time. Sedimentary rocks can contain
fossils because, unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, they form at
temperatures and pressures that do not destroy fossil remains.
***** Provenance *****
Distribution of detritus
Main article: Provenance_(geology)
Provenance is the reconstruction of the origin of sediments. All rock exposed
at the Earth's surface is subjected to physical or chemical weathering and
broken down into finer grained sediment. All three types of rocks (igneous,
sedimentary and metamorphic rocks) can be the source of sedimentary detritus.
The purpose of sedimentary provenance studies is to reconstruct and interpret
the history of sediment from the initial parent rocks at a source area to final
detritus at a burial place.[54]
