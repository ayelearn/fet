***** Definitions[edit] *****
**** Primary melts[edit] ****
When a rock melts to form a liquid, the liquid is known as a primary melt.
Primary melts have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting
composition of a magma. In nature, primary melts are rarely seen. Some
leucosomes of migmatites are examples of primary melts. Primary melts derived
from the mantle are especially important and are known as primitive melts or
primitive magmas. By finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series,
it is possible to model the composition of the rock from which a melt was
formed, which is important because we have little direct evidence of the
Earth's mantle.
**** Parental melts[edit] ****
Where it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it
is often useful to attempt to identify a parental melt. A parental melt is a
magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been
derived by the processes of igneous differentiation. It need not be a primitive
melt.
For instance, a series of basalt lava flows is assumed to be related to one
another. A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by
fractional_crystallization is termed a parental melt. To prove this, fractional
crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share
a common parental melt.
**** Cumulate rocks[edit] ****
Main article: Cumulate_rocks
Fractional crystallization and accumulation of crystals formed during the
differentiation process of a magmatic event are known as cumulate rocks, and
those parts are the first which crystallize out of the magma. Identifying
whether a rock is a cumulate or not is crucial for understanding if it can be
modelled back to a primary melt or a primitive melt, and identifying whether
the magma has dropped out cumulate minerals is equally important even for rocks
which carry no phenocrysts.
***** Underlying causes of differentiation[edit] *****
The primary cause of change in the composition of a magma is cooling, which is
an inevitable consequence of the magma being created and migrating from the
site of partial melting into an area of lower stress - generally a cooler
volume of the crust.
Cooling causes the magma to begin to crystallize minerals from the melt or
liquid portion of the magma. Most magmas are a mixture of liquid rock (melt)
and crystalline minerals (phenocrysts).
Contamination is another cause of magma differentiation. Contamination can be
caused by assimilation of wall rocks, mixing of two or more magmas or even by
replenishment of the magma chamber with fresh, hot magma.
The whole gamut of mechanisms for differentiation has been referred to as the
FARM process, which stands for Fractional crystallization, Assimilation,
Replenishment and Magma mixing.
**** Fractional crystallization of igneous rocks[edit] ****
Fractional_crystallization is the removal and segregation from a melt of
mineral precipitates, which changes the composition of the melt. This is one of
the most important geochemical and physical processes operating within the
Earth's crust and mantle.
Fractional crystallization in silicate melts (magmas) is a very complex process
compared to chemical systems in the laboratory because it is affected by a wide
variety of phenomena. Prime amongst these are the composition, temperature, and
pressure of a magma during its cooling.
The composition of a magma is the primary control on which mineral is
crystallized as the melt cools down past the liquidus. For instance in mafic
and ultramafic melts, the MgO and SiO2 contents determine whether forsterite
olivine is precipitated or whether enstatite pyroxene is precipitated.
Two magmas of similar composition and temperature at different pressure may
crystallize different minerals. An example is high-pressure and high-
temperature fractional crystallization of granites to produce single-feldspar
granite, and low-pressure low-temperature conditions which produce two-feldspar
granites.
The partial_pressure of volatile phases in silicate melts is also of prime
importance, especially in near-solidus crystallization of granites.
**** Assimilation[edit] ****
Assimilation is a popular mechanism for explaining the felsification of
ultramafic and mafic magmas as they rise through the crust. Assimilation
assumes that a hot primitive melt intruding into a cooler, felsic crust will
melt the crust and mix with the resulting melt. This then alters the
composition of the primitive magma. Also pre-existing mafic host rocks can be
assimilated, with little effect on the bulk magma chemistry [1].
Effects of this kind are to be expected, and have been clearly proven in many
places. There is, however, a general reluctance to admit that they are of great
importance. The nature and succession of the rock_types do not as a rule show
any relation to the sedimentary or other materials which may be supposed to
have been dissolved; and where solution is known to have gone on the products
are usually of abnormal character and easily distinguishable from the common
rock types.[2]
**** Replenishment[edit] ****
When a melt undergoes cooling along the liquid line of descent, the results are
limited to the production of a homogeneous solid body of intrusive rock, with
uniform mineralogy and composition, or a partially differentiated cumulate mass
with layers, compositional zones and so on. This behaviour is fairly
predictable and easy enough to prove with geochemical investigations. In such
cases, a magma chamber will form a close approximation of the ideal Bowen's
reaction_series. However, most magmatic systems are polyphase events, with
several pulses of magmatism. In such a case, the liquid line of descent is
interrupted by the injection of a fresh batch of hot, undifferentiated magma.
This can cause extreme fractional crystallisation because of three main
effects:
    * Additional heat provides additional energy to allow more vigorous
      convection, allows resorption of existing mineral phases back into the
      melt, and can cause a higher-temperature form of a mineral or other
      higher-temperature minerals to begin precipitating
    * Fresh magma changes the composition of the melt, changing the chemistry
      of the phases which are being precipitated. For instance, plagioclase
      conforms to the liquid line of descent by forming initial anorthite
      which, if removed, changes the equilibrium mineral composition to
      oligoclase or albite. Replenishment of the magma can see this trend
      reversed, so that more anorthite is precipitated atop cumulate layers of
      albite.
    * Fresh magma destabilises minerals which are precipitating as solid
      solution series or on a eutectic; a change in composition and temperature
      can cause extremely rapid crystallisation of certain mineral phases which
      are undergoing a eutectic crystallisation phase.
**** Magma mixing[edit] ****
Magma mixing is the process by which two magmas meet, comingle, and form a
magma of a composition somewhere between the two end-member magmas.
Magma mixing is a common process in volcanic magma chambers, which are open-
system chambers where magmas enter the chamber, undergo some form of
assimilation, fractional crystallisation and partial melt extraction (via
eruption of lava), and are replenished.
Magma mixing also tends to occur at deeper levels in the crust and is
considered one of the primary mechanisms for forming intermediate rocks such as
monzonite and andesite. Here, due to heat transfer and increased volatile flux
from subduction, the silicic crust melts to form a felsic magma (essentially
granitic in composition). These granitic melts are known as an underplate.
Basaltic primary melts formed in the mantle beneath the crust rise and mingle
with the underplate magmas, the result being part-way between basalt and
rhyolite; literally an 'intermediate' composition.
**** Other mechanisms of differentiation[edit] ****
Interface entrapment Convection in a large magma chamber is subject to the
interplay of forces generated by thermal convection and the resistance offered
by friction, viscosity and drag on the magma offered by the walls of the magma
chamber. Often near the margins of a magma chamber which is convecting, cooler
and more viscous layers form concentrically from the outside in, defined by
breaks in viscosity and temperature. This forms laminar_flow, which separates
several domains of the magma chamber which can begin to differentiate
separately.
Flow_banding is the result of a process of fractional crystallization which
occurs by convection, if the crystals which are caught in the flow-banded
margins are removed from the melt. The friction and viscosity of the magma
causes phenocrysts and xenoliths within the magma or lava to slow down near the
interface and become trapped in a viscous layer. This can change the
composition of the melt in large intrusions, leading to differentiation.
Partial melt extraction
With reference to the definitions, above, a magma chamber will tend to cool
down and crystallize minerals according to the liquid line of descent. When
this occurs, especially in conjunction with zonation and crystal accumulation,
and the melt portion is removed, this can change the composition of a magma
chamber. In fact, this is basically fractional crystallization, except in this
case we are observing a magma chamber which is the remnant left behind from
which a daughter melt has been extracted.
If such a magma chamber continues to cool, the minerals it forms and its
overall composition will not match a sample liquid line of descent or a
parental magma composition.
***** Typical behaviours of magma chambers[edit] *****
It is worth reiterating that magma chambers are not usually static single
entities. The typical magma chamber is formed from a series of injections of
melt and magma, and most are also subject to some form of partial melt
extraction.
Granite magmas are generally much more viscous than mafic magmas and are
usually more homogeneous in composition. This is generally considered to be
caused by the viscosity of the magma, which is orders of magnitude higher than
mafic magmas. The higher viscosity means that, when melted, a granitic magma
will tend to move in a larger concerted mass and be emplaced as a larger mass
because it is less fluid and able to move. This is why granites tend to occur
as large plutons, and mafic rocks as dikes and sills.
Granites are cooler and are therefore less able to melt and assimilate country
rocks. Wholesale contamination is therefore minor and unusual, although mixing
of granitic and basaltic melts is not unknown where basalt is injected into
granitic magma chambers.
Mafic magmas are more liable to flow, and are therefore more likely to undergo
periodic replenishment of a magma chamber. Because they are more fluid, crystal
precipitation occurs much more rapidly, resulting in greater changes by
fractional crystallisation. Higher temperatures also allow mafic magmas to
assimilate wall rocks more readily and therefore contamination is more common
and better developed.
**** Dissolved gases[edit] ****
All igneous magmas contain dissolved gases (water, carbonic_acid, hydrogen
sulfide, chlorine, fluorine, boric_acid, etc.). Of these water is the
principal, and was formerly believed to have percolated downwards from the
Earth's surface to the heated rocks below, but is now generally admitted to be
an integral part of the magma. Many peculiarities of the structure of the
plutonic rocks as contrasted with the lavas may reasonably be accounted for by
the operation of these gases, which were unable to escape as the deep-seated
masses slowly cooled, while they were promptly given up by the superficial
effusions. The acid plutonic or intrusive rocks have never been reproduced by
laboratory experiments, and the only successful attempts to obtain their
minerals artificially have been those in which special provision was made for
the retention of the "mineralizing" gases in the crucibles or sealed tubes
employed. These gases often do not enter into the composition of the rock-
forming minerals, for most of these are free from water, carbonic acid, etc.
Hence as crystallization goes on the residual melt must contain an ever-
increasing proportion of volatile constituents. It is conceivable that in the
final stages the still uncrystallized part of the magma has more resemblance to
a solution of mineral matter in superheated steam than to a dry igneous fusion.
Quartz, for example, is the last mineral to form in a granite. It bears much of
the stamp of the quartz which we know has been deposited from aqueous_solution
in veins, etc. It is at the same time the most infusible of all the common
minerals of rocks. Its late formation shows that in this case it arose at
comparatively low temperatures and points clearly to the special importance of
the gases of the magma as determining the sequence of crystallization.[2]
When solidification is nearly complete the gases can no longer be retained in
the rock and make their escape through fissures towards the surface. They are
powerful agents in attacking the minerals of the rocks which they traverse, and
instances of their operation are found in the kaolinization of granites,
tourmalinization and formation of greisen, deposition of quartz veins, and the
group of changes known as propylitization. These "pneumatolytic" processes are
of the first importance in the genesis of many ore_deposits. They are a real
part of the history of the magma itself and constitute the terminal phases of
the volcanic sequence.[2]
***** Quantifying igneous differentiation[edit] *****
There are several methods of directly measuring and quantifying igneous
differentiation processes;
    * Whole rock geochemistry of representative samples, to track changes and
      evolution of the magma systems
          o Using the above, calculating normative_mineralogy and investigating
            trends
    * Trace element geochemistry
    * Isotope_geochemistry
          o Investigating the contamination of magma systems by wall_rock
            assimilation using radiogenic isotopes
In all cases, the primary and most valuable method for identifying magma
differentiation processes is mapping the exposed rocks, tracking mineralogical
changes within the igneous rocks and describing field relationships and
textural evidence for magma differentiation.
