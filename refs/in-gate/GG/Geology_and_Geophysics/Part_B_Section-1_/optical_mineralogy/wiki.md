A petrographic_microscope, which is an optical_microscope fitted with cross-
polarizing lenses, a conoscopic_lens, and compensators (plates of anisotropic
materials; gypsum plates and quartz wedges are common), for crystallographic
analysis.
Optical mineralogy is the study of minerals and rocks by measuring their
optical properties. Most commonly, rock and mineral samples are prepared as
thin_sections or grain mounts for study in the laboratory with a petrographic
microscope. Optical mineralogy is used to identify the mineralogical
composition of geological materials in order to help reveal their origin and
evolution.
Some of the properties and techniques used include:

***** History[edit] *****
William_Nicol, whose name is associated with the creation of the Nicol_prism,
is likely the first to prepare thin slices of mineral substances, and his
methods were applied by Henry_Thronton_Maire_Witham (1831) to the study of
plant petrifactions. This method, of significant importance in petrology, was
not at once made use of for the systematic investigation of rocks, and it was
not until 1858 that Henry_Clifton_Sorby pointed out its value. Meanwhile, the
optical study of sections of crystals had been advanced by Sir David_Brewster
and other physicists and mineralogists and it only remained to apply their
methods to the minerals visible in rock sections.[2]
***** Sections[edit] *****
A rock-section should be about one-thousandth of an inch (30 micrometres) in
thickness, and is relatively easy to make. A thin splinter of the rock, about 1
centimetre may be taken; it should be as fresh as possible and free from
obvious cracks. By grinding it on a plate of planed steel or cast iron with a
little fine carborundum it is soon rendered flat on one side, and is then
transferred to a sheet of plate glass and smoothed with the finest grained
emery until all roughness and pits are removed, and the surface is a uniform
plane. The rock chip is then washed, and placed on a copper or iron plate which
is heated by a spirit or gas lamp. A microscopic glass slip is also warmed on
this plate with a drop of viscous natural Canada_balsam on its surface. The
more volatile ingredients of the balsam are dispelled by the heat, and when
that is accomplished the smooth, dry, warm rock is pressed firmly into contact
with the glass plate so that the film of balsam intervening may be as thin as
possible and free from air bubbles. The preparation is allowed to cool, and the
rock chip is again ground down as before, first with carborundum and, when it
becomes transparent, with fine emery until the desired thickness is obtained.
It is then cleaned, again heated with an additional small amount of balsam, and
covered with a cover glass. The labor of grinding the first surface may be
avoided by cutting off a smooth slice with an iron disk armed with crushed
diamond powder. A second application of the slitter after the first face is
smoothed and cemented to the glass will, in expert hands, leave a section of
rock so thin as to be transparent. In this way the preparation of a section may
require only twenty minutes.[2]
***** Microscope[edit] *****
Photomicrograph of a volcanic_lithic_fragment (sand_grain); upper picture is
plane-polarized light, bottom picture is cross-polarized light, scale box at
left-center is 0.25 millimeter.
The microscope employed is usually one which is provided with a rotating stage
beneath which there is a polarizer, while above the objective or eyepiece an
analyzer is mounted; alternatively the stage may be fixed, and the polarizing
and analyzing prisms may be capable of simultaneous rotation by means of
toothed wheels and a connecting rod. If ordinary light and not polarized light
is desired, both prisms may be withdrawn from the axis of the instrument; if
the polarizer only is inserted the light transmitted is plane polarized; with
both prisms in position the slide is viewed in cross-polarized light, also
known as "crossed_nicols." A microscopic rock-section in ordinary light, if a
suitable magnification (e.g. around 30x) be employed, is seen to consist of
grains or crystals varying in color, size, and shape.[2]
***** Characteristics of minerals[edit] *****
Some minerals are colorless and transparent (quartz, calcite, feldspar,
muscovite, etc.), while others are yellow or brown (rutile, tourmaline,
biotite), green (diopside, hornblende, chlorite), blue (glaucophane), pink
(garnet), etc. The same mineral may present a variety of colors, in the same or
different rocks, and these colors may be arranged in zones parallel to the
surfaces of the crystals. Thus tourmaline may be brown, yellow, pink, blue,
green, violet, grey, or colorless, but every mineral has one or more
characteristic, most common tints. The shapes of the crystals determine in a
general way the outlines of the sections of them presented on the slides. If
the mineral has one or more good cleavages, they will be indicated by systems
of cracks. The refractive_index is also clearly shown by the appearance of the
section, which are rough, with well-defined borders if they have a much
stronger refraction than the medium in which they are mounted. Some minerals
decompose readily and become turbid and semi-transparent (e.g. feldspar);
others remain always perfectly fresh and clear (e.g. quartz), while others
yield characteristic secondary products (such as green chlorite after biotite).
The inclusions in the crystals (both solid and fluid) are of great interest;
one mineral may enclose another, or may contain spaces occupied by glass, by
fluids or by gases.[2]
***** Microstructure[edit] *****
The structure of the rock - the relation of its components to one another - is
usually clearly indicated, whether it is fragmented or massive; the presence of
glassy matter in contradistinction to a completely crystalline or "holo-
crystalline" condition; the nature and origin of organic fragments; banding,
foliation or lamination; the pumiceous or porous structure of many lavas. These
and many other characters, though often not visible in the hand specimens of a
rock, are rendered obvious by the examination of a microscopic section. Various
methods of detailed observation may be applied, such as the measurement of the
size of the elements of the rock by the help of micrometers, their relative
proportions by means of a glass plate ruled in small squares, the angles
between cleavages or faces seen in section by the use of the rotating graduated
stage, and the estimation of the refractive index of the mineral by comparison
with those of different mounting media.[2]
***** Pleochroism[edit] *****
Main article: Pleochroism
Further information is obtained by inserting the lower polarizer and rotating
the section. The light vibrates in only one plane, and in passing through
doubly refracting crystals in the slide, is, speaking generally, broken up into
rays, which vibrate at right angles to one another. In many colored minerals
such as biotite, hornblende, tourmaline, chlorite, these two rays have
different colors, and when a section containing any of these minerals is
rotated the change of color is often clearly noticeable. This property, known
as "pleochroism" is of great value in the determination of mineral composition.
Pleochroism is often especially intense in small spots which surround minute
enclosures of other minerals, such as zircon and epidote. These are known as
"pleochroic_halos."[2]
***** Double refraction[edit] *****
If the analyzer is inserted in such a position that it is crossed relatively to
the polarizer, the field of view will be dark where there are no minerals or
where the light passes through isotropic substances such as glass, liquids and
cubic crystals. All other crystalline bodies, being doubly refracting, will
appear bright in some position as the stage is rotated. The only exception to
this rule is provided by sections which are perpendicular to the optic_axes of
birefringent crystals, which remain dark or nearly dark during a whole
rotation, the investigation of which is frequently important.[2]
**** Extinction[edit] ****
Doubly refracting mineral sections will in all cases appear black in certain
positions as the stage is rotated. They are said to "go extinct" when this
takes place. The angle between these and any cleavages can be measured by
rotating the stage and recording these positions. These angles are
characteristic of the system to which the mineral belongs, and often of the
mineral species itself (see Crystallography). To facilitate measurement of
extinction angles, various types of eyepieces have been devised, some having a
stereoscopic calcite plate, others with two or four plates of quartz cemented
together. These are often found to give more precise results than are obtained
by observing only the position in which the mineral section is most completely
dark between crossed nicols.
The mineral sections when not extinguished are not only bright, but are
colored, and the colors they show depend on several factors, the most important
of which is the strength of the double refraction. If all the sections are of
the same thickness, as is nearly true of well-made slides, the minerals with
strongest double refraction yield the highest polarization colors. The order in
which the colors are arranged is expressed in what is known as Newton's scale,
the lowest being dark grey, then grey, white, yellow, orange, red, purple,
blue, and so on. The difference between the refractive indexes of the ordinary
and the extraordinary ray in quartz is .009, and in a rock-section about 1/500
of an inch thick, this mineral gives grey and white polarization colors;
nepheline with weaker double refraction gives dark grey; augite on the other
hand will give red and blue, while calcite with the stronger double refraction
will appear pinkish or greenish white. All sections of the same mineral,
however, will not have the same color: sections perpendicular to an optic axis
will be nearly black, and, in general, the more nearly any section approaches
this direction the lower its polarization colors will be. By taking the
average, or the highest color given by any mineral, the relative value of its
double refraction can be estimated, or if the thickness of the section be
precisely known the difference between the two refractive indexes can be
ascertained. If the slides are thick the colors will be on the whole higher
than on thin slides.
It is often important to find out whether of the two axes of elasticity (or
vibration traces) in the section is that of greater elasticity (or lesser
refractive index). The quartz wedge or selenite plate enables this. Suppose a
doubly refracting mineral section so placed that it is "extinguished"; if now
is rotated through 45 degrees it will be brightly illuminated. If the quartz
wedge be passed across it so that the long axis of the wedge is parallel to the
axis of elasticity in the section the polarization colors will rise or fall. If
they rise the axes of greater elasticity in the two minerals are parallel; if
they sink the axis of greater elasticity in the one is parallel to that of
lesser elasticity in the other. In the latter case by pushing the wedge
sufficiently far complete darkness or compensation will result. Selenite
wedges, selenite plates, mica wedges and mica plates are also used for this
purpose. A quartz wedge also may be calibrated by determining the amount of
double refraction in all parts of its length. If now it be used to produce
compensation or complete extinction in any doubly refracting mineral section,
we can ascertain what is the strength of the double refraction of the section
because it is obviously equal and opposite to that of a known part of the
quartz wedge.
A further refinement of microscopic methods consists of the use of strongly
convergent polarized light (conoscopic methods). This is obtained by a wide
angled achromatic condenser above the polarizer, and a high power microscopic
objective. Those sections are most useful which are perpendicular to an optic
axis, and consequently remain dark on rotation. If they belong to uniaxial
crystals they show a dark cross or convergent light between crossed nicols, the
bars of which remain parallel to the wires in the field of the eyepiece.
Sections perpendicular to an optic axis of a biaxial mineral under the same
conditions show a dark bar which on rotation becomes curved to a hyperbolic
shape. If the section is perpendicular to a "bisectrix" (see Crystallography) a
black cross is seen which on rotation opens out to form two hyperbolas, the
apices of which are turned towards one another. The optic axes emerge at the
apices of the hyperbolas and may be surrounded by colored rings, though owing
to the thinness of minerals in rock sections these are only seen when the
double refraction of the mineral is strong. The distance between the axes as
seen in the field of the microscope depends partly on the axial angle of the
crystal and partly on the numerical aperture of the objective. If it is
measured by means of eye-piece micrometer, the optic axial angle of the mineral
can be found by a simple calculation. The quartz wedge, quarter mica plate or
selenite plate permit the determination of the positive or negative character
of the crystal by the changes in the color or shape of the figures observed in
the field. These operations are similar to those employed by the mineralogist
in the examination of plates cut from crystals.[2]
**** Examination of rock powders[edit] ****
Although rocks are now studied principally in microscopic sections the
investigation of fine crushed rock powders, which was the first branch of
microscopic petrology to receive attention, is still actively used. The modern
optical methods are readily applicable to transparent mineral fragments of any
kind. Minerals are almost as easily determined in powder as in section, but it
is otherwise with rocks, as the structure or relation of the components to one
another. This is an element of great importance in the study of the history and
classification of rocks, and is almost completely destroyed by grinding them to
powder.[2]
