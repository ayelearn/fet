Eolianite carbonate facies (Holocene) on Long_Island,_Bahamas
In geology, a facies (pronounced variously as /ËfeÉªÊiËz/, /ËfeÉªsiËz/ or
/ËfÃ¦ÊiËz/ ['faysheez', 'fayseez' or 'fash-eez']; plural also 'facies') is a
body of rock with specified characteristics,[1] which can be any observable
attribute of rocks (such as their overall appearance, composition, or condition
of formation), and the changes that may occur in those attributes over a
geographic area. It is the sum total characteristics of a rock including its
chemical, physical, and biological features that distinguishes it from adjacent
rock.[2]
The term facies was introduced by the Swiss geologist Amanz_Gressly in 1838 and
was part of his significant contribution to the foundations of modern
stratigraphy,[3] which replaced the earlier notions of Neptunism.

***** Types of facies[edit] *****
**** Sedimentary facies[edit] ****
Middle Triassic marginal marine siltstone and sandstone facies exposed in
southern Utah
Ideally, a sedimentary facies is a distinctive rock_unit that forms under
certain conditions of sedimentation, reflecting a particular process or
environment. Sedimentary facies are either descriptive or interpretative.
Sedimentary facies are bodies of sediment that are recognizably distinct from
adjacent sediments that resulted from different depositional environments.
Generally, geologists distinguish facies by the aspect of the rock or sediment
being studied.[citation_needed] Facies based on petrological characters (such
as grain size and mineralogy) are called lithofacies, whereas facies based on
fossil content are called biofacies.
A facies is usually further subdivided, for example, one might refer to a "tan,
cross-bedded oolitic limestone facies" or a "shale facies". The characteristics
of the rock unit come from the depositional_environment and from the original
composition. Sedimentary facies reflect their depositional environment, each
facies being a distinct kind of sediment for that area or environment.
Since its inception in 1838, the facies concept has been extended to related
geological concepts. For example, characteristic associations of organic
microfossils, and particulate organic material, in rocks or sediments, are
called palynofacies. Discrete seismic units are similarly referred to as
seismic facies.
Sedimentary facies are described in a group of "facies descriptors" which must
be distinct, reproducible and exhaustive. A reliable facies description of an
outcrop in the field would include: composition, texture, sedimentary structure
(s), bedding geometry, nature of bedding contact, fossil content and colour.
*** Walther's Law of Facies[edit] ***
Stratigraphic column on the north shore of Isfjord in Svalbard Norway. The
vertical succession of rock types (representing sedimentary facies) reflects
lateral changes in paleoenvironment.
Walther's Law of Facies, or simply Walther's Law, named after the geologist
Johannes_Walther (1860-1937), states that the vertical succession of facies
reflects lateral changes in environment. Conversely, it states that when a
depositional environment "migrates" laterally, sediments of one depositional
environment come to lie on top of another.[4] In Russia the law is known as
Golovkinsky-Walther's Law, honoring also Nikolai_A._Golovkinsky[5] (1834-1897).
A classic example of this law is the vertical stratigraphic succession that
typifies marine transgressions and regressions.
**** Metamorphic facies[edit] ****
Main article: Metamorphic_facies
The sequence of minerals that develop during progressive metamorphism (that is,
metamorphism at progressively higher temperatures and/or pressures) define a
facies series.
**** Seismic facies[edit] ****
Seismic facies are mappable three-dimensional seismic units composed of
reflection units whose parameters differ from adjacent facies units.

      shows that the fundamentals of sequence stratigraphy were first set forth
      in the work of N. A. Golovkinsky.
