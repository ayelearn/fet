Ocean (1858).[1]
Continental drift is the theory that the Earth's continents have moved over
geologic time relative to each other, thus appearing to have "drifted" across
the ocean bed.[2] The speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was
first put forward by Abraham_Ortelius in 1596. The concept was independently
and more fully developed by Alfred_Wegener in 1912, but his theory was rejected
by many for lack of any motive mechanism. Arthur_Holmes later proposed mantle
convection for that mechanism. The idea of continental drift has since been
subsumed by the theory of plate_tectonics, which explains that the continents
move by riding on plates of the Earth's lithosphere.[3]

**** Early history[edit] ****
Abraham_Ortelius (Ortelius_1596),[4] Theodor Christoph Lilienthal (1756),[5]
Alexander_von_Humboldt (1801 and 1845),[5] Antonio_Snider-Pellegrini (Snider-
Pellegrini_1858), and others had noted earlier that the shapes of continents on
opposite sides of the Atlantic_Ocean (most notably, Africa and South America)
seem to fit together.[6] W. J. Kious described Ortelius' thoughts in this way:
[7]
     Abraham Ortelius in his work Thesaurus Geographicus ... suggested
     that the Americas were "torn away from Europe and Africa ... by
     earthquakes and floods" and went on to say: "The vestiges of the
     rupture reveal themselves if someone brings forward a map of the
     world and considers carefully the coasts of the three [continents]."
In 1889, Alfred_Russel_Wallace remarked, "It was formerly a very general
belief, even amongst geologists, that the great features of the earth's
surface, no less than the smaller ones, were subject to continual mutations,
and that during the course of known geological time the continents and great
oceans had, again and again, changed places with each other."[8] He quotes
Charles_Lyell as saying, "Continents, therefore, although permanent for whole
geological epochs, shift their positions entirely in the course of ages."[9]
and claims that the first to throw doubt on this was James_Dwight_Dana in 1849.
In his Manual of Geology (1863), Dana wrote, "The continents and oceans had
their general outline or form defined in earliest time. This has been proved
with respect to North America from the position and distribution of the first
beds of the Silurian â those of the Potsdam epoch. â¦ and this will probably
prove to the case in Primordial time with the other continents also".[10] Dana
was enormously influential in America â his Manual of Mineralogy is still in
print in revised form â and the theory became known as Permanence theory.[11]
This appeared to be confirmed by the exploration of the deep sea beds conducted
by the Challenger_expedition, 1872â1876, which showed that contrary to
expectation, land debris brought down by rivers to the ocean is deposited
comparatively close to the shore on what is now known as the continental_shelf.
This suggested that the oceans were a permanent feature of the Earth's surface,
and did not change places[clarification_needed] with the continents.[8]
**** Wegener and his predecessors[edit] ****
Alfred Wegener
Apart from the earlier speculations mentioned in the previous section, the idea
that the American continents had once formed a single landmass together with
Europe and Asia before assuming their present shapes and positions was
speculated by several scientists before Alfred_Wegener's 1912 paper.[12]
Although Wegener's theory was formed independently and was more complete than
those of his predecessors, Wegener later credited a number of past authors with
similar ideas:[13][14] Franklin Coxworthy (between 1848 and 1890),[15] Roberto
Mantovani (between 1889 and 1909), William_Henry_Pickering (1907)[16] and Frank
Bursley_Taylor (1908).[17] In addition, Eduard_Suess had proposed a
supercontinent Gondwana in 1885[18] and the Tethys_Ocean in 1893,[19] assuming
a land-bridge between the present continents submerged in the form of a
geosyncline, and John_Perry had written an 1895 paper proposing that the
earth's interior was fluid, and disagreeing with Lord_Kelvin on the age of the
earth.[20]
For example: the similarity of southern continent geological formations had led
Roberto_Mantovani to conjecture in 1889 and 1909 that all the continents had
once been joined into a supercontinent; Wegener noted the similarity of
Mantovani's and his own maps of the former positions of the southern
continents. In Mantovani's conjecture, this continent broke due to volcanic
activity caused by thermal_expansion, and the new continents drifted away from
each other because of further expansion of the rip-zones, where the oceans now
lie. This led Mantovani to propose an Expanding_Earth_theory which has since
been shown to be incorrect.[21][22][23]
Continental drift without expansion was proposed by Frank_Bursley_Taylor,[24]
who suggested in 1908 (published in 1910) that the continents were moved into
their present positions by a process of "continental creep".[25][26] In a later
paper he proposed that this occurred by their being dragged towards the equator
by tidal forces during the hypothesized capture of the moon in the Cretaceous,
resulting in "general crustal creep" toward the equator. Although his proposed
mechanism was wrong, he was the first to realize the insight that one of the
effects of continental motion would be the formation of mountains, and
attributed the formation of the Himalayas to the collision between the Indian
subcontinent with Asia.[27] Wegener said that of all those theories, Taylor's,
although not fully developed, had the most similarities to his own. In the mid-
20th century, the theory of continental drift was referred to as the "Taylor-
Wegener hypothesis",[24][27][28] although this terminology eventually fell out
of common use.[29]
Alfred Wegener first presented his hypothesis to the German Geological Society
on 6 January 1912.[12] His hypothesis was that the continents had once formed a
single landmass, called Pangaea, before breaking apart and drifting to their
present locations.
Wegener was the first to use the phrase "continental drift" (1912, 1915)[12]
[13] (in German "die Verschiebung der Kontinente" â translated into English
in 1922) and formally publish the hypothesis that the continents had somehow
"drifted" apart. Although he presented much evidence for continental drift, he
was unable to provide a convincing explanation for the physical processes which
might have caused this drift. His suggestion that the continents had been
pulled apart by the centrifugal_pseudoforce (Polflucht) of the Earth's rotation
or by a small component of astronomical precession was rejected, as
calculations showed that the force was not sufficient.[30] The Polflucht
hypothesis was also studied by Paul_Sophus_Epstein in 1920 and found to be
implausible.
**** Rejection of Wegener's theory, 1910sâ1950s[edit] ****
The theory of continental drift was not accepted for many years. One problem
was that a plausible driving force was missing.[2] A second problem was that
Wegener's estimate of the velocity of continental motion, 250  cm/year, was
implausibly high.[31] (The currently accepted rate for the separation of the
Americas from Europe and Africa is about 2.5  cm/year).[32] It also did not
help that Wegener was not a geologist. Other geologists also believed that the
evidence that Wegener had provided was not sufficient. It is now accepted that
the plates carrying the continents do move across the Earth's surface, although
not as fast as Wegener believed; ironically one of the chief outstanding
questions is the one Wegener failed to resolve: what is the nature of the
forces propelling the plates?[2]
The British geologist Arthur_Holmes championed the theory of continental drift
at a time when it was deeply unfashionable. He proposed in 1931 that the
Earth's mantle contained convection cells which dissipated heat produced by
radioactive decay and moved the crust at the surface.[33] His Principles of
Physical Geology, ending with a chapter on continental drift, was published in
1944.[34]
Geological maps of the time showed huge land bridges spanning the Atlantic and
Indian oceans to account for the similarities of fauna and flora and the
divisions of the Asian continent in the Permian period but failing to account
for glaciation in India, Australia and South Africa.[35]
Geophysicist Jack_Oliver is credited with providing seismologic evidence
supporting plate tectonics which encompassed and superseded continental drift
with the article "Seismology and the New Global Tectonics", published in 1968,
using data collected from seismologic stations, including those he set up in
the South Pacific.[36][37]
It is now known that there are two kinds of crust: continental_crust and
oceanic_crust. Continental crust is inherently lighter and its composition is
different from oceanic crust, but both kinds reside above a much deeper
"plastic" mantle. Oceanic crust is created at spreading_centers, and this,
along with subduction, drives the system of plates in a chaotic manner,
resulting in continuous orogeny and areas of isostatic imbalance. The theory of
plate_tectonics explains all this, including the movement of the continents,
better than Wegener's theory.
*** The fixists[edit] ***
Hans_Stille and Leopold_Kober opposed the idea of continental drift and worked
on a "fixist"[38] geosyncline model with Earth_contraction playing a key role
in the formation of orogens.[39][40] Other geologists who opposed continental
drift were Bailey_Willis, Charles_Schuchert, Rollin Chamberlin and Walther
Bucher.[41] In 1939 an international geological conference was held in
Frankfurt.[42] This conference came to be dominated by the fixists, especially
as those geologists specializing in tectonics were all fixists except Willem
van der Gracht.[42] Criticism of continental drift and mobilism was abundant at
the conference not only from tectonicists but also from sedimentological
(NÃ¶lke), paleontological (NÃ¶lke), mechanical (Lehmann) and oceanographic
(Troll, WÃ¼st) perspectives.[42][43] Hans_Cloos, the organizer of the
conference, was also a fixist[42] who together with Troll held the view that
excepting the Pacific_Ocean continents were not radically different from oceans
in their behaviour.[43] The mobilist theory of Ãmile_Argand for the Alpine
orogeny was criticized by Kurt Leuchs.[42] The few drifters and mobilists at
the conference appealed to biogeography (Kirsch, Wittmann), paleoclimatology
(Wegener,_K), paleontology (Gerth) and geodetic measurements (Wegener, K).[44]
F. Bernauer correctly equated Reykjanes in south-west Iceland with the Mid-
Atlantic_Ridge, arguing with this that the floor of the Atlantic Ocean was
undergoing extension just like Reykjanes. Bernauer thought this extension had
drifted the continents only 100â200 km apart, the approximate width of the
volcanic_zone_in_Iceland.[45]
David_Attenborough, who attended university in the second half of the 1940s,
recounted an incident illustrating its lack of acceptance then: "I once asked
one of my lecturers why he was not talking to us about continental drift and I
was told, sneeringly, that if I could prove there was a force that could move
continents, then he might think about it. The idea was moonshine, I was
informed."[46]
As late as 1953 â just five years before Carey[47] introduced the theory of
plate_tectonics â the theory of continental drift was rejected by the
physicist Scheidegger on the following grounds.[48]
    * First, it had been shown that floating masses on a rotating geoid would
      collect at the equator, and stay there. This would explain one, but only
      one, mountain building episode between any pair of continents; it failed
      to account for earlier orogenic episodes.
    * Second, masses floating freely in a fluid substratum, like icebergs in
      the ocean, should be in isostatic equilibrium (in which the forces of
      gravity and buoyancy are in balance). But gravitational measurements
      showed that many areas are not in isostatic equilibrium.
    * Third, there was the problem of why some parts of the Earth's surface
      (crust) should have solidified while other parts were still fluid.
      Various attempts to explain this foundered on other difficulties.
***** Road to acceptance[edit] *****
Main article: Plate_tectonics
From the 1930s to the late 1950s, works by Vening-Meinesz, Holmes, Umbgrove,
and numerous others outlined concepts that were close or nearly identical to
modern plate tectonics theory. In particular, the English geologist Arthur
Holmes proposed in 1920 that plate junctions might lie beneath the sea, and in
1928 that convection currents within the mantle might be the driving force.[49]
Holmes' views were particularly influential: in his bestselling textbook,
Principles of Physical Geology, he included a chapter on continental drift,
proposing that Earth's mantle contained convection_cells which dissipated
radioactive heat and moved the crust at the surface.[50][51]  Holmes' proposal
resolved the phase disequilibrium objection (the underlying fluid was kept from
solidifying by radioactive heating from the core).  However, scientific
communication in the '30 and '40s was inhibited by the_war, and the theory
still required work to avoid foundering on the orogeny and isostasy objections.
 Worse, the most viable forms of the theory predicted the existence of
convection cell boundaries reaching deep into the earth that had yet to be
observed.[citation_needed]
In 1947, a team of scientists led by Maurice_Ewing confirmed the existence of a
rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed
beneath the sediments was chemically and physically different from continental
crust.[52][53]  As oceanographers continued to bathymeter the ocean basins, a
system of mid-oceanic ridges was detected.  An important conclusion was that
along this system, new ocean floor was being created, which led to the concept
of the "Great_Global_Rift".[54]
Meanwhile, scientists began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the
ocean floor using devices developed during World War II to detect submarines.
[55]  Over the next decade, it became increasingly clear that the magnetization
patterns were not anomalies, as had been originally supposed. In a series of
papers in 1959-1963, Heezen, Dietz, Hess, Mason, Vine, Matthews, and Morley
collectively realized that the magnetization of the ocean floor formed
extensive, zebra-like patterns: one stripe would exhibit normal polarity and
the adjoining stripes reversed polarity.[56][57][58]  The best explanation was
the "conveyor belt" or VineâMatthewsâMorley_hypothesis.  New magma from
deep within the Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually
erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new oceanic crust.  The new
crust is magnetized by the earth's magnetic field, which undergoes occasional
reversals.  Formation of new crust then displaces the magnetized crust apart,
akin to a conveyor belt — hence the name.[59]
Without workable alternatives to explain the stripes, geophysicists were forced
to conclude that Holmes had been right: ocean rifts were sites of perpetual
orogeny at the boundaries of convection cells.[60][61] By 1967, barely two
decades after discovery of the mid-oceanic rifts, and a decade after discovery
of the striping, plate tectonics had become axiomatic to modern geophysics.
In addition, Marie Tharp, in collaboration with Bruce Heezen, who initially
ridiculed Tharp's observations that her maps confirmed continental drift
theory, provided essential corroboration, using her skills in cartography and
seismographic data, to confirm the theory.[62][63][64][65][66]
**** Modern evidence[edit] ****
Fossil patterns across continents (Gondwanaland).
Evidence for the movement of continents on tectonic plates is now extensive.
Similar plant and animal fossils are found around the shores of different
continents, suggesting that they were once joined. The fossils of Mesosaurus, a
freshwater reptile rather like a small crocodile, found both in Brazil and
South_Africa, are one example; another is the discovery of fossils of the land
reptile Lystrosaurus in rocks of the same age at locations in Africa, India,
and Antarctica.[67] There is also living evidence, with the same animals being
found on two continents. Some earthworm families (such as Ocnerodrilidae,
Acanthodrilidae, Octochaetidae) are found in South America and Africa.
Mesosaurus skeleton, MacGregor, 1908.
The complementary arrangement of the facing sides of South America and Africa
is obvious but a temporary coincidence. In millions of years, slab_pull, ridge-
push, and other forces of tectonophysics will further separate and rotate those
two continents. It was that temporary feature that inspired Wegener to study
what he defined as continental drift although he did not live to see his
hypothesis generally accepted.
The widespread distribution of Permo-Carboniferous glacial sediments in South
America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia was one of
the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift. The
continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented glacial_striations and deposits
called tillites, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of Gondwana,
which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations
indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on
continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the
southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations
that were contiguous with one another.[13]

      drift and the prevailing belief that the earth was solid and immovable

      she noted what must have been a rift between high undersea mountains.
      This suggested earthquake activity, which then [was] only associated with
      [the] fringe theory of continental drift. Heezen infamously dismissed his
      assistant's idea as "girl talk." But she was right, and her thinking
      helped to vindicate Alfred Wegener's 1912 theory of moving continents.
      Yet Tharp's name isn't on any of the key papers that Heezen and others
      published about plate tectonics between 1959â1963, which brought this
      once-controversial idea to the mainstream of earth sciences.
