A glacier (US:/ËÉ¡leÉªÊÉr/ or UK:/ËÉ¡lÃ¦siÉr,_ËÉ¡leÉªsiÉr/) is a
persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it
forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and
sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow
due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other
distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate
to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land
and are distinct from the much thinner sea_ice and lake ice that form on the
surface of bodies of water.
On Earth, 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice_sheets (also known as
"continental glaciers") in the polar_regions, but glaciers may be found in
mountain_ranges on every continent including Oceania's high-latitude oceanic
island countries such as New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Between 35Â°N and
35Â°S, glaciers occur only in the Himalayas, Andes, Rocky_Mountains, a few high
mountains in East_Africa, Mexico, New_Guinea and on Zard_Kuh in Iran.[1]
Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth's land surface. Continental glaciers
cover nearly 13 million km2 (5 million sq mi) or about 98 percent of
Antarctica's 13.2 million km2 (5.1 million sq mi), with an average thickness of
2,100 m (7,000 ft). Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of
continental glaciers.[2] The volume of glaciers, not including the ice sheets
of Antarctica and Greenland, has been estimated as 170,000 km3.[3]
Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of fresh_water on Earth.[4] Many glaciers
from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during
the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer
summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water_source that is
especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may
be scant. Within high-altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal
temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater.
Since glacial mass is affected by long-term climatic changes, e.g.,
precipitation, mean_temperature, and cloud_cover, glacial_mass_changes are
considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate_change and are a
major source of variations in sea_level.
A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, appears_blue, as large
quantities of water_appear_blue. This is because water molecules absorb other
colors more efficiently than blue. The other reason for the blue color of
glaciers is the lack of air bubbles. Air bubbles, which give a white color to
ice, are squeezed out by pressure increasing the density of the created ice.

***** Etymology and related terms[edit] *****
The word glacier is a loanword from French and goes back, via Franco-
ProvenÃ§al, to the Vulgar_Latin glaciÄrium, derived from the Late_Latin
glacia, and ultimately Latin glaciÄs, meaning "ice".[5] The processes and
features caused by or related to glaciers are referred to as glacial. The
process of glacier establishment, growth and flow is called glaciation. The
corresponding area of study is called glaciology. Glaciers are important
components of the global cryosphere.
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Classification by size, shape and behavior[edit] ****
Further information: Glacier_morphology
Mouth of the Schlatenkees_Glacier near InnergschlÃ¶Ã, Austria
Glaciers are categorized by their morphology, thermal characteristics, and
behavior. Alpine glaciers form on the crests and slopes of mountains. A glacier
that fills a valley is called a valley glacier, or alternatively an alpine
glacier or mountain glacier.[6] A large body of glacial ice astride a mountain,
mountain_range, or volcano is termed an ice_cap or ice_field.[7] Ice caps have
an area less than 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi) by definition.
Glacial bodies larger than 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi) are called ice_sheets or
continental glaciers.[8] Several kilometers deep, they obscure the underlying
topography. Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces. The only extant ice
sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland.[9] They contain
vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels
would rise by over 70 m (230 ft).[10] Portions of an ice sheet or cap that
extend into water are called ice_shelves; they tend to be thin with limited
slopes and reduced velocities.[11] Narrow, fast-moving sections of an ice sheet
are called ice_streams.[12][13] In Antarctica, many ice streams drain into
large ice_shelves. Some drain directly into the sea, often with an ice_tongue,
like Mertz_Glacier.

Tidewater_glaciers are glaciers that terminate in the sea, including most
glaciers flowing from Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere_Islands in
Canada, Southeast_Alaska, and the Northern and Southern_Patagonian_Ice_Fields.
As the ice reaches the sea, pieces break off, or calve, forming icebergs. Most
tidewater glaciers calve above sea level, which often results in a tremendous
impact as the iceberg strikes the water. Tidewater glaciers undergo centuries-
long cycles_of_advance_and_retreat that are much less affected by the climate
change than those of other glaciers.[14]
**** Classification by thermal state[edit] ****
Thermally, a temperate glacier is at melting point throughout the year, from
its surface to its base. The ice of a polar glacier is always below the
freezing point from the surface to its base, although the surface snowpack may
experience seasonal melting. A subpolar glacier includes both temperate and
polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length
of the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often
described by its basal temperature. A cold-based glacier is below freezing at
the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate. A
warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to
slide at this contact.[15] This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern
the ability of a glacier to effectively erode_its_bed, as sliding ice promotes
plucking at rock from the surface below.[16] Glaciers which are partly cold-
based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal.[15]
***** Formation[edit] *****
Gorner_Glacier in Switzerland
Glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation. A
glacier usually originates from a landform called 'cirque' (or corrie or cwm)
â a typically armchair-shaped geological feature (such as a depression
between mountains enclosed by arÃªtes) â which collects and compresses
through gravity the snow that falls into it. This snow collects and is
compacted by the weight of the snow falling above it, forming nÃ©vÃ©. Further
crushing of the individual snowflakes and squeezing the air from the snow turns
it into "glacial ice". This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it
"overflows" through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as the gap between
two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins
to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure. On steeper
slopes, this can occur with as little as 15 m (50 ft) of snow-ice.
A packrafter passes a wall of freshly exposed blue ice on Spencer Glacier, in
Alaska. Glacial ice acts like a filter on light, and the more time light can
spend traveling through ice, the bluer it becomes.
In temperate glaciers, snow repeatedly freezes and thaws, changing into
granular ice called firn. Under the pressure of the layers of ice and snow
above it, this granular ice fuses into denser and denser firn. Over a period of
years, layers of firn undergo further compaction and become glacial ice.
Glacier ice is slightly less dense than ice formed from frozen water because it
contains tiny trapped air bubbles.
Glacial ice has a distinctive blue tint because it absorbs some red light due
to an overtone of the infrared OH_stretching mode of the water molecule. Liquid
water is blue for the same reason. The blue of glacier ice is sometimes
misattributed to Rayleigh_scattering due to bubbles in the ice.[17]

***** Structure[edit] *****
A glacier originates at a location called its glacier head and terminates at
its glacier foot, snout, or terminus.
Glaciers are broken into zones based on surface snowpack and melt conditions.
[18] The ablation zone is the region where there is a net loss in glacier mass.
The equilibrium line separates the ablation zone and the accumulation_zone; it
is the altitude where the amount of new snow gained by accumulation is equal to
the amount of ice lost through ablation. The upper part of a glacier, where
accumulation exceeds ablation, is called the accumulation_zone. In general, the
accumulation zone accounts for 60â70% of the glacier's surface area, more if
the glacier calves icebergs. Ice in the accumulation zone is deep enough to
exert a downward force that erodes underlying rock. After a glacier melts, it
often leaves behind a bowl- or amphitheater-shaped depression that ranges in
size from large basins like the Great Lakes to smaller mountain depressions
known as cirques.
The accumulation zone can be subdivided based on its melt conditions.
   1. The dry snow zone is a region where no melt occurs, even in the summer,
      and the snowpack remains dry.
   2. The percolation zone is an area with some surface melt, causing meltwater
      to percolate into the snowpack. This zone is often marked by refrozen ice
      lenses, glands, and layers. The snowpack also never reaches melting
      point.
   3. Near the equilibrium line on some glaciers, a superimposed ice zone
      develops. This zone is where meltwater refreezes as a cold layer in the
      glacier, forming a continuous mass of ice.
   4. The wet snow zone is the region where all of the snow deposited since the
      end of the previous summer has been raised to 0 Â°C.
The health of a glacier is usually assessed by determining the glacier_mass
balance or observing terminus behavior. Healthy glaciers have large
accumulation zones, more than 60% of their area snowcovered at the end of the
melt season, and a terminus with vigorous flow.
Following the Little_Ice_Age's end around 1850, glaciers_around_the_Earth_have
retreated_substantially. A slight cooling led to the advance of many alpine
glaciers between 1950 and 1985, but since 1985 glacier retreat and mass loss
has become larger and increasingly ubiquitous.[19][20][21]
***** Motion[edit] *****
Shear or herring-bone crevasses on Emmons_Glacier (Mount_Rainier); such
crevasses often form near the edge of a glacier where interactions with
underlying or marginal rock impede flow. In this case, the impediment appears
to be some distance from the near margin of the glacier.
Main article: Ice-sheet_dynamics
Glaciers move, or flow, downhill due to gravity and the internal deformation of
ice.[22] Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about
50 m (160 ft). The pressure on ice deeper than 50 m causes plastic_flow. At the
molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively
weak bonds between layers. When the stress on the layer above exceeds the
inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.[23]
Glaciers also move through basal_sliding. In this process, a glacier slides
over the terrain on which it sits, lubricated by the presence of liquid water.
The water is created from ice that melts under high pressure from frictional
heating. Basal sliding is dominant in temperate, or warm-based glaciers.
Although evidence in favour of glacial flow was known by the early 19th
century, other theories of glacial motion were advanced, such as the idea that
melt water, refreezing inside glaciers, caused the glacier to dilate and extend
its length. As it became clear that glaciers behaved to some degree as if the
ice were a viscous fluid, it was argued that "regelation", or the melting and
refreezing of ice at a temperature lowered by the pressure on the ice inside
the glacier, was what allowed the ice to deform and flow. James_Forbes came up
with the essentially correct explanation in the 1840s, although it was several
decades before it was fully accepted.[24]
Perito Moreno glacier
**** Fracture zone and cracks[edit] ****
Ice cracks in the Titlis Glacier
The top 50 m (160 ft) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low
pressure. This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as
a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves
through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture
zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid
sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces
cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than
46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper.
Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.
Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called seracs.
Crevasses can form in several different ways. Transverse crevasses are
transverse to flow and form where steeper slopes cause a glacier to accelerate.
Longitudinal crevasses form semi-parallel to flow where a glacier expands
laterally. Marginal crevasses form from the edge of the glacier, due to the
reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls. Marginal crevasses
are usually largely transverse to flow. Moving glacier ice can sometimes
separate from stagnant ice above, forming a bergschrund. Bergschrunds resemble
crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins.
Crevasses make travel over glaciers hazardous, especially when they are hidden
by fragile snow_bridges.

United States
Below the equilibrium line, glacial meltwater is concentrated in stream
channels. Meltwater can pool in proglacial lakes on top of a glacier or descend
into the depths of a glacier via moulins. Streams within or beneath a glacier
flow in englacial or sub-glacial tunnels. These tunnels sometimes reemerge at
the glacier's surface.[25]
**** Speed[edit] ****
The speed of glacial displacement is partly determined by friction. Friction
makes the ice at the bottom of the glacier move more slowly than ice at the
top. In alpine glaciers, friction is also generated at the valley's side walls,
which slows the edges relative to the center.
Mean speeds vary greatly, but is typically around 1 m (3 ft) per day.[26] There
may be no motion in stagnant areas; for example, in parts of Alaska, trees can
establish themselves on surface sediment deposits. In other cases, glaciers can
move as fast as 20â30 m (70â100 ft) per day, such as in Greenland's
Jakobshavn_IsbrÃ¦ (Greenlandic: Sermeq Kujalleq). Velocity increases with
increasing slope, increasing thickness, increasing snowfall, increasing
longitudinal confinement, increasing basal temperature, increasing meltwater
production and reduced bed hardness.
A few glaciers have periods of very rapid advancement called surges. These
glaciers exhibit normal movement until suddenly they accelerate, then return to
their previous state. During these surges, the glacier may reach velocities far
greater than normal speed.[27] These surges may be caused by failure of the
underlying bedrock, the pooling of meltwater at the base of the glacier[28] â
perhaps delivered from a supraglacial_lake â or the simple accumulation of
mass beyond a critical "tipping point".[29] Temporary rates up to 90 m (300 ft)
per day have occurred when increased temperature or overlying pressure caused
bottom ice to melt and water to accumulate beneath a glacier.
In glaciated areas where the glacier moves faster than one km per year, glacial
earthquakes occur. These are large scale earthquakes that have seismic
magnitudes as high as 6.1.[30][31] The number of glacial earthquakes in
Greenland peaks every year in July, August and September and increased rapidly
in the 1990s and 2000s. In a study using data from January 1993 through October
2005, more events were detected every year since 2002, and twice as many events
were recorded in 2005 as there were in any other year.[31]
**** Ogives[edit] ****
Ogives (or Forbes bands)[32] are alternating wave crests and valleys that
appear as dark and light bands of ice on glacier surfaces. They are linked to
seasonal motion of glaciers; the width of one dark and one light band generally
equals the annual movement of the glacier. Ogives are formed when ice from an
icefall is severely broken up, increasing ablation surface area during summer.
This creates a swale and space for snow accumulation in the winter, which in
turn creates a ridge.[33] Sometimes ogives consist only of undulations or color
bands and are described as wave ogives or band ogives.[34]

Black ice glacier near Aconcagua, Argentina
Glaciers are present on every continent and approximately fifty countries,
excluding those (Australia, South Africa) that have glaciers only on distant
subantarctic island territories. Extensive glaciers are found in Antarctica,
Argentina, Chile, Canada, Alaska, Greenland and Iceland. Mountain glaciers are
widespread, especially in the Andes, the Himalayas, the Rocky_Mountains, the
Caucasus, Scandinavian_mountains, and the Alps. Snezhnika glacier in Pirin
Mountain, Bulgaria with a latitude of 41Â°46â²09â³ N is the southernmost
glacial mass in Europe.[35] Mainland Australia currently contains no glaciers,
although a small glacier on Mount_Kosciuszko was present in the last_glacial
period.[36] In New_Guinea, small, rapidly diminishing, glaciers are located on
its highest summit massif of Puncak_Jaya.[37] Africa has glaciers on Mount
Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, on Mount_Kenya and in the Rwenzori_Mountains. Oceanic
islands with glaciers include Iceland, several of the islands off the coast of
Norway including Svalbard and Jan_Mayen to the far North, New_Zealand and the
subantarctic islands of Marion, Heard, Grande_Terre_(Kerguelen) and Bouvet.
During glacial periods of the Quaternary, Taiwan, Hawaii on Mauna_Kea[38] and
Tenerife also had large alpine glaciers, while the Faroe and Crozet_Islands[39]
were completely glaciated.
The permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation is affected by factors
such as the degree of slope on the land, amount of snowfall and the winds.
Glaciers can be found in all latitudes except from 20Â° to 27Â° north and south
of the equator where the presence of the descending limb of the Hadley
circulation lowers precipitation so much that with high insolation snow_lines
reach above 6,500 m (21,330 ft). Between 19ËN and 19ËS, however,
precipitation is higher and the mountains above 5,000 m (16,400 ft) usually
have permanent snow.
Even at high latitudes, glacier formation is not inevitable. Areas of the
Arctic, such as Banks_Island, and the McMurdo_Dry_Valleys in Antarctica are
considered polar_deserts where glaciers cannot form because they receive little
snowfall despite the bitter cold. Cold air, unlike warm air, is unable to
transport much water vapor. Even during glacial periods of the Quaternary,
Manchuria, lowland Siberia,[40] and central and northern_Alaska,[41] though
extraordinarily cold, had such light snowfall that glaciers could not form.[42]
[43]
In addition to the dry, unglaciated polar regions, some mountains and volcanoes
in Bolivia, Chile and Argentina are high (4,500 to 6,900 m or 14,800 to
22,600 ft) and cold, but the relative lack of precipitation prevents snow from
accumulating into glaciers. This is because these peaks are located near or in
the hyperarid Atacama_Desert.
***** Glacial geology[edit] *****
Diagram of glacial plucking and abrasion
Glacially plucked granitic bedrock near Mariehamn, Ãland_Islands
Glaciers erode terrain through two principal processes: abrasion and plucking.
As glaciers flow over bedrock, they soften and lift blocks of rock into the
ice. This process, called plucking, is caused by subglacial water that
penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands. This
expansion causes the ice to act as a lever that loosens the rock by lifting it.
Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the glacier's load. If a retreating
glacier gains enough debris, it may become a rock_glacier, like the Timpanogos
Glacier in Utah.
Abrasion occurs when the ice and its load of rock fragments slide over bedrock
and function as sandpaper, smoothing and polishing the bedrock below. The
pulverized rock this process produces is called rock_flour and is made up of
rock grains between 0.002 and 0.00625 mm in size. Abrasion leads to steeper
valley walls and mountain slopes in alpine settings, which can cause avalanches
and rock slides, which add even more material to the glacier.
Glacial abrasion is commonly characterized by glacial_striations. Glaciers
produce these when they contain large boulders that carve long scratches in the
bedrock. By mapping the direction of the striations, researchers can determine
the direction of the glacier's movement. Similar to striations are chatter
marks, lines of crescent-shape depressions in the rock underlying a glacier.
They are formed by abrasion when boulders in the glacier are repeatedly caught
and released as they are dragged along the bedrock.
The rate of glacier erosion varies. Six factors control erosion rate:
    * Velocity of glacial movement
    * Thickness of the ice
    * Shape, abundance and hardness of rock fragments contained in the ice at
      the bottom of the glacier
    * Relative ease of erosion of the surface under the glacier
    * Thermal conditions at the glacier base
    * Permeability and water pressure at the glacier base
When the bedrock has frequent fractures on the surface, glacial erosion rates
tend to increase as plucking is the main erosive force on the surface; when the
bedrock has wide gaps between sporadic fractures, however, abrasion tends to be
the dominant erosive form and glacial erosion rates become slow.[44]
Glaciers in lower latitudes tend to be much more erosive than glaciers in
higher latitudes, because they have more meltwater reaching the glacial base
and facilitate sediment production and transport under the same moving speed
and amount of ice.[45]
Material that becomes incorporated in a glacier is typically carried as far as
the zone_of_ablation before being deposited. Glacial deposits are of two
distinct types:
    * Glacial till: material directly deposited from glacial ice. Till includes
      a mixture of undifferentiated material ranging from clay size to
      boulders, the usual composition of a moraine.
    * Fluvial and outwash sediments: sediments deposited by water. These
      deposits are stratified by size.
Larger pieces of rock that are encrusted in till or deposited on the surface
are called "glacial_erratics". They range in size from pebbles to boulders, but
as they are often moved great distances, they may be drastically different from
the material upon which they are found. Patterns of glacial erratics hint at
past glacial motions.
**** Moraines[edit] ****
Glacial moraines above Lake_Louise, Alberta, Canada
Glacial moraines are formed by the deposition of material from a glacier and
are exposed after the glacier has retreated. They usually appear as linear
mounds of till, a non-sorted mixture of rock, gravel and boulders within a
matrix of a fine powdery material. Terminal or end moraines are formed at the
foot or terminal end of a glacier. Lateral moraines are formed on the sides of
the glacier. Medial moraines are formed when two different glaciers merge and
the lateral moraines of each coalesce to form a moraine in the middle of the
combined glacier. Less apparent are ground_moraines, also called glacial drift,
which often blankets the surface underneath the glacier downslope from the
equilibrium line.
The term moraine is of French origin. It was coined by peasants to describe
alluvial embankments and rims found near the margins of glaciers in the French
Alps. In modern geology, the term is used more broadly, and is applied to a
series of formations, all of which are composed of till. Moraines can also
create moraine dammed lakes.
**** Drumlins[edit] ****
A drumlin field forms after a glacier has modified the landscape. The teardrop-
shaped formations denote the direction of the ice flow.
Drumlins are asymmetrical, canoe shaped hills made mainly of till. Their
heights vary from 15 to 50 meters and they can reach a kilometer in length. The
steepest side of the hill faces the direction from which the ice advanced
(stoss), while a longer slope is left in the ice's direction of movement (lee).
Drumlins are found in groups called drumlin_fields or drumlin camps. One of
these fields is found east of Rochester,_New_York; it is estimated to contain
about 10,000 drumlins.
Although the process that forms drumlins is not fully understood, their shape
implies that they are products of the plastic deformation zone of ancient
glaciers. It is believed that many drumlins were formed when glaciers advanced
over and altered the deposits of earlier glaciers.
**** Glacial valleys, cirques, arÃªtes, and pyramidal peaks[edit] ****
Features of a glacial landscape
Before glaciation, mountain valleys have a characteristic "V"_shape, produced
by eroding water. During glaciation, these valleys are often widened, deepened
and smoothed to form a "U"-shaped glacial valley or glacial trough, as it is
sometimes called.[46] The erosion that creates glacial valleys truncates any
spurs of rock or earth that may have earlier extended across the valley,
creating broadly triangular-shaped cliffs called truncated_spurs. Within
glacial valleys, depressions created by plucking and abrasion can be filled by
lakes, called paternoster_lakes. If a glacial valley runs into a large body of
water, it forms a fjord.
Typically glaciers deepen their valleys more than their smaller tributaries.
Therefore, when glaciers recede, the valleys of the tributary glaciers remain
above the main glacier's depression and are called hanging_valleys.
At the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped cirque, which has
escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the
valley. Cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier. Two glacial
cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow
ridge, called an arÃªte is left. This structure may result in a mountain_pass.
If multiple cirques encircle a single mountain, they create pointed pyramidal
peaks; particularly steep examples are called horns.
**** Roches moutonnÃ©es[edit] ****
Passage of glacial ice over an area of bedrock may cause the rock to be
sculpted into a knoll called a roche_moutonnÃ©e, or "sheepback" rock. Roches
moutonnÃ©es may be elongated, rounded and asymmetrical in shape. They range in
length from less than a meter to several hundred meters long.[47] Roches
moutonnÃ©es have a gentle slope on their up-glacier sides and a steep to
vertical face on their down-glacier sides. The glacier abrades the smooth slope
on the upstream side as it flows along, but tears rock fragments loose and
carries them away from the downstream side via plucking.
**** Alluvial stratification[edit] ****
As the water that rises from the ablation_zone moves away from the glacier, it
carries fine eroded sediments with it. As the speed of the water decreases, so
does its capacity to carry objects in suspension. The water thus gradually
deposits the sediment as it runs, creating an alluvial_plain. When this
phenomenon occurs in a valley, it is called a valley train. When the deposition
is in an estuary, the sediments are known as bay_mud.
Outwash plains and valley trains are usually accompanied by basins known as
"kettles". These are small lakes formed when large ice blocks that are trapped
in alluvium melt and produce water-filled depressions. Kettle diameters range
from 5 m to 13 km, with depths of up to 45 meters. Most are circular in shape
because the blocks of ice that formed them were rounded as they melted.[48]
**** Glacial deposits[edit] ****
Landscape produced by a receding glacier
When a glacier's size shrinks below a critical point, its flow stops and it
becomes stationary. Meanwhile, meltwater within and beneath the ice leaves
stratified alluvial deposits. These deposits, in the forms of columns, terraces
and clusters, remain after the glacier melts and are known as "glacial
deposits".
Glacial deposits that take the shape of hills or mounds are called kames. Some
kames form when meltwater deposits sediments through openings in the interior
of the ice. Others are produced by fans or deltas created by meltwater. When
the glacial ice occupies a valley, it can form terraces or kames along the
sides of the valley.
Long, sinuous glacial deposits are called eskers. Eskers are composed of sand
and gravel that was deposited by meltwater streams that flowed through ice
tunnels within or beneath a glacier. They remain after the ice melts, with
heights exceeding 100 meters and lengths of as long as 100 km.
**** Loess deposits[edit] ****
Very fine glacial sediments or rock_flour is often picked up by wind blowing
over the bare surface and may be deposited great distances from the original
fluvial deposition site. These eolian loess deposits may be very deep, even
hundreds of meters, as in areas of China and the Midwestern United States of
America. Katabatic_winds can be important in this process.
***** Isostatic rebound[edit] *****
Main article: Post-glacial_rebound
Isostatic pressure by a glacier on the Earth's crust
Large masses, such as ice sheets or glaciers, can depress the crust of the
Earth into the mantle.[49] The depression usually totals a third of the ice
sheet or glacier's thickness. After the ice sheet or glacier melts, the mantle
begins to flow back to its original position, pushing the crust back up. This
post-glacial_rebound, which proceeds very slowly after the melting of the ice
sheet or glacier, is currently occurring in measurable amounts in Scandinavia
and the Great_Lakes region of North America.
A geomorphological feature created by the same process on a smaller scale is
known as dilation-faulting. It occurs where previously compressed rock is
allowed to return to its original shape more rapidly than can be maintained
without faulting. This leads to an effect similar to what would be seen if the
rock were hit by a large hammer. Dilation faulting can be observed in recently
de-glaciated parts of Iceland and Cumbria.
***** On Mars[edit] *****
Northern polar_ice_cap on Mars
Main article: Glaciers_on_Mars
The polar ice_caps of Mars show geologic evidence of glacial deposits. The
south polar cap is especially comparable to glaciers on Earth.[50]
Topographical features and computer models indicate the existence of more
glaciers in Mars' past.[51]
At mid-latitudes, between 35Â° and 65Â° north or south, Martian glaciers are
affected by the thin Martian atmosphere. Because of the low atmospheric
pressure, ablation near the surface is solely due to sublimation, not melting.
As on Earth, many glaciers are covered with a layer of rocks which insulates
the ice. A radar instrument on board the Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter found ice
under a thin layer of rocks in formations called lobate_debris_aprons (LDAs).
[52][53][54][55][56]
The pictures below illustrate how landscape features on Mars closely resemble
those on the Earth.
    * Romer_Lake's Elephant Foot Glacier in the Earth's Arctic, as seen by
      Landsat 8. This picture shows several glaciers that have the same shape
      as many features on Mars that are believed to also be glaciers. The next
      three images from Mars show shapes similar to the Elephant Foot Glacier.
    * Mesa in Ismenius_Lacus_quadrangle, as seen by CTX. Mesa has several
      glaciers eroding it. One of the glaciers is seen in greater detail in the
      next two images from HiRISE. Image from Ismenius_Lacus_quadrangle.
    * Glacier as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish_program. Area in rectangle is
      enlarged in the next photo. Zone of accumulation of snow at the top.
      Glacier is moving down valley, then spreading out on plain. Evidence for
      flow comes from the many lines on surface. Location is in Protonilus
      Mensae in Ismenius_Lacus_quadrangle.
    * Enlargement of area in rectangle of the previous image. On Earth the
      ridge would be called the terminal moraine of an alpine glacier. Picture
      taken with HiRISE under the HiWish program. Image from Ismenius_Lacus
      quadrangle.
