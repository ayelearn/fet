A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm_system characterized by a low-
pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong_winds, and
a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. Depending on its
location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names,
including hurricane (/ËhÊrÉªkÉn,_-keÉªn/),[1][2][3] typhoon (/taÉªËfuËn/),
tropical_storm, cyclonic storm, tropical_depression, and simply cyclone.[4] A
hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic_Ocean and
northeastern Pacific_Ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific
Ocean; in the south Pacific or Indian_Ocean, comparable storms are referred to
simply as "tropical cyclones" or "severe cyclonic storms".[4]
"Tropical" refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form
almost exclusively over tropical seas. "Cyclone" refers to their winds moving
in a circle,[5] whirling round their central clear eye, with their winds
blowing counterclockwise in the Northern_Hemisphere and clockwise in the
Southern_Hemisphere. The opposite direction of circulation is due to the
Coriolis_effect. Tropical cyclones typically_form over large bodies of
relatively warm water. They derive their energy through the evaporation of
water from the ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain
when moist air rises and cools to saturation. This energy_source differs from
that of mid-latitude_cyclonic_storms, such as nor'easters and European
windstorms, which are fueled primarily by horizontal_temperature_contrasts.
Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km (62 and 1,243 mi) in
diameter.
The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the
conservation_of_angular_momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows
inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result, they rarely form within 5Â°
of the equator.[6] Tropical cyclones are almost unknown in the South Atlantic
due to a consistently strong wind_shear and a weak Intertropical_Convergence
Zone.[7] Also, the African_easterly_jet and areas of atmospheric instability
which give rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, along with
the_Asian_monsoon and Western_Pacific_Warm_Pool, are features of the Northern
Hemisphere and Australia.
Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impact of a tropical
cyclone, compared to inland regions. The primary energy source for these storms
is warm ocean waters, therefore these forms are typically strongest when over
or near water, and weaken quite rapidly over land. Coastal damage may be caused
by strong winds and rain, high waves (due to winds), storm_surges (due to wind
and severe pressure changes), and the_potential of spawning tornadoes. Tropical
cyclones also draw in air from a large areaâwhich can be a vast area for the
most severe cyclonesâand concentrate the precipitation of the water content
in that air (made up from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from
water) into a much smaller area. This continual replacement of moisture-bearing
air by new moisture-bearing air after its moisture has fallen as rain, which
may cause extremely heavy rain and river flooding up to 40 kilometres (25 mi)
from the coastline, far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere
holds at any one time.
Though their effects on human populations are often devastating, tropical
cyclones can relieve drought conditions. They also carry heat energy away from
the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes, which may play an
important role in modulating regional and global climate.

***** Physical structure *****

Diagram of a Northern hemisphere hurricane
Tropical cyclones are areas of relatively low_pressure in the troposphere, with
the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface.
On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among
the lowest ever observed at sea_level.[8] The environment near the center of
tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they
are characterized as "warm core" systems.[9]
**** Wind field ****
The near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air
rotating rapidly around a center_of_circulation while also flowing radially
inwards. At the outer edge of the storm, air may be nearly calm; however, due
to the Earth's rotation, the air has non-zero absolute_angular_momentum. As air
flows radially inward, it begins to rotate_cyclonically (counter-clockwise in
the Northern Hemisphere, and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) in order to
conserve_angular_momentum. At an inner radius, air begins to ascend to the top
of_the_troposphere. This radius is typically coincident with the inner radius
of the eyewall, and has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm;
consequently, it is known as the radius_of_maximum_winds.[10] Once aloft, air
flows away from the storm's center, producing a shield of cirrus_clouds.[11]
The previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly
axisymmetric: Wind speeds are low at the center, increase rapidly moving
outwards to the radius of maximum winds, and then decay more gradually with
radius to large radii. However, the wind field often exhibits additional
spatial and temporal variability due to the effects of localized processes,
such as thunderstorm_activity and horizontal flow_instabilities. In the
vertical direction, winds are strongest near the surface and decay with height
within the troposphere.[12]
**** Eye and center ****
Thunderstorm activity in the eyewall of Cyclone_Bansi as seen from the
International_Space_Station, on January 12, 2015
At the center of a mature tropical cyclone, air sinks rather than rises. For a
sufficiently strong storm, air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress
cloud formation, thereby creating a clear "eye". Weather in the eye is normally
calm and free of clouds, although the sea may be extremely violent.[13] The eye
is normally circular in shape, and is typically 30â65 km (19â40 mi) in
diameter, though eyes as small as 3 km (1.9 mi) and as large as 370 km (230 mi)
have been observed.[14][15]
The cloudy outer edge of the eye is called the "eyewall". The eyewall typically
expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this
phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the "stadium_effect".[15] The eyewall is
where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach
to their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind
damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.[13]
In a weaker storm, the eye may be obscured by the central_dense_overcast, which
is the upper-level cirrus shield that is associated with a concentrated area of
strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone.[16]
The eyewall may vary over time in the form of eyewall_replacement_cycles,
particularly in intense tropical cyclones. Outer_rainbands can organize into an
outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward, which is believed to rob
the primary eyewall of moisture and angular_momentum. When the primary eyewall
weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually
replaces the primary one at the end of the cycle, at which time the storm may
return to its original intensity.[17]
**** Rapid intensification ****
Main article: Rapid_intensification
On occasion, tropical cyclones may undergo a process known as rapid
intensification, a period in which the maximum sustained winds of a tropical
cyclone increase by 30 knots within a 24-hour period.[18] In order for rapid
intensification to occur, several conditions must be in place. Water
temperatures must be extremely high (near or above 30 Â°C, 86 Â°F), and water
of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not upwell
cooler waters to the surface. Wind_shear must be low; when wind shear is high,
the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted. Usually, an
anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be
present as wellâfor extremely low surface pressures to develop, air must be
rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm, and an upper-level anticyclone
helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently.[19]
**** Size ****
Size descriptions of tropical cyclones
ROCI (Diameter)              Type
Less than 2 degrees latitudeVery small/minor
2 to 3 degrees of latitude  Small
3 to 6 degrees of latitude  Medium/Average/Normal
6 to 8 degrees of latitude  Large
Over 8 degrees of latitude  Very large[20]
There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most
common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind
(i.e. gale_force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius
of vanishing wind.[21][22] An additional metric is the radius at which the
cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1Ã10â5 sâ1.[15]
On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100â2,000
kilometres (62â1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They
are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the
northeastern Pacific Ocean basin.[23] If the radius of outermost closed isobar
is less than two degrees_of_latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is
"very small" or a "midget". A radius of 3â6 latitude degrees (333â670 km
(207â416 mi)) is considered "average sized". "Very large" tropical cyclones
have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)).[20] Observations
indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm
intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and
maximum potential intensity.[22][23]
Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else
equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time.
Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm_surge
due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave
setup.[24]
The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the
atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000â18,000 metres
(50,000â60,000 ft).[25]
***** Physics and energetics *****
Tropical cyclones exhibit an overturning circulation where air inflows at low
levels near the surface, rises in thunderstorm clouds, and outflows at high
levels near the tropopause.[26]
The three-dimensional wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into
two components: a "primary circulation" and a "secondary_circulation". The
primary circulation is the rotational part of the flow; it is purely circular.
The secondary circulation is the overturning (in-up-out-down) part of the flow;
it is in the radial and vertical directions. The primary circulation is larger
in magnitude, dominating the surface wind field, and is responsible for the
majority of the damage a storm causes, while the secondary circulation is
slower but governs the energetics of the storm.
**** Secondary circulation: a Carnot heat engine ****
A tropical cyclone's primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of
water from the surface of a warm ocean, previously heated by sunshine. The
energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot_heat_engine.
[27] First, inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via
evaporation of water (i.e. latent_heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean
surface (during evaporation, the ocean cools and the air warms). Second, the
warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat
content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible_heat during condensation).
Third, air outflows and loses heat via infrared_radiation to space at the
temperature of the cold tropopause. Finally, air subsides and warms at the
outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content. The first and
third legs are nearly isothermal, while the second and fourth legs are nearly
isentropic. This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary
circulation. The Carnot perspective provides an upper_bound on the maximum wind
speed that a storm can attain.
Scientists estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at the rate of
50 to 200 exajoules (1018 J) per day,[28] equivalent to about 1 PW (1015 watt).
This rate of energy release is equivalent to 70 times the world_energy
consumption of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating
capacity, or to exploding a 10-megaton nuclear_bomb every 20 minutes.[28][29]
**** Primary circulation: rotating winds ****
The primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the conservation
of_angular_momentum by the secondary circulation. Absolute_angular_momentum on
a rotating planet     M   {\displaystyle M}  [M] is given by
         M =   1 2   f  r  2   + v r   {\displaystyle M={\frac {1}{2}}fr^
      {2}+vr}  [M = \frac{1}{2}fr^2 + vr]
where     f   {\displaystyle f}  [f] is the Coriolis_parameter,     v
{\displaystyle v}  [v] is the azimuthal (i.e. rotating) wind speed, and     r
{\displaystyle r}  [r] is the radius to the axis of rotation. The first term on
the right hand side is the component of planetary angular momentum that
projects onto the local vertical (i.e. the axis of rotation). The second term
on the right hand side is the relative angular momentum of the circulation
itself with respect to the axis of rotation. Because the planetary angular
momentum term vanishes at the equator (where     f = 0   {\displaystyle f=0}
[f=0] ), tropical cyclones rarely form within 5Â° of the equator.[6][30]
As air flows radially inward at low levels, it begins to rotate cyclonically in
order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly, as rapidly rotating air flows
radially outward near the tropopause, its cyclonic rotation decreases and
ultimately changes sign at large enough radius, resulting in an upper-level
anti-cyclone. The result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong
cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause; from
thermal_wind_balance, this corresponds to a system that is warmer at its center
than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (i.e. "warm-core"). From
hydrostatic_balance, the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center
at all altitudes, with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface.[12]
**** Maximum potential intensity ****
Due to surface friction, the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum.
Thus, the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source (evaporation) and
sink (friction) of energy for the system. This fact leads to the existence of a
theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can
attain. Because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed (just as
climbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day), there is a positive
feedback on energy input into the system known as the Wind-Induced Surface Heat
Exchange (WISHE) feedback.[27] This feedback is offset when frictional
dissipation, which increases with the cube of the wind speed, becomes
sufficiently large. This upper bound is called the "maximum potential
intensity",      v  p     {\displaystyle v_{p}}  [v_p], and is given by
          v  p   2   =    C  k    C  d         T  s   &#x2212;  T  o     T  o
      &#x0394; k   {\displaystyle v_{p}^{2}={\frac {C_{k}}{C_{d}}}{\frac {T_
      {s}-T_{o}}{T_{o}}}\Delta k}  [v_p^2 = \frac{C_k}{C_d}\frac{T_s - T_o}
      {T_o}\Delta k]
where      T  s     {\displaystyle T_{s}}  [T_{s}] is the temperature of the
sea surface,      T  o     {\displaystyle T_{o}}  [T_{o}] is the temperature of
the outflow ([K]),     &#x0394; k   {\displaystyle \Delta k}  [\Delta k] is the
enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air ([J/kg]), and
C  k     {\displaystyle C_{k}}  [C_{k}] and      C  d     {\displaystyle C_{d}}
[C_{d}] are the surface exchange_coefficients (dimensionless) of enthalpy and
momentum, respectively.[31] The surface-air enthalpy difference is taken as
&#x0394; k =  k  s   &#x2217;   &#x2212; k   {\displaystyle \Delta k=k_{s}^{*}-
k}  [\Delta k = k^*_s-k], where      k  s   &#x2217;     {\displaystyle k_{s}^
{*}}  [k^*_s] is the saturation enthalpy of air at sea surface temperature and
sea-level pressure and     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] is the enthalpy of
boundary layer air overlying the surface.
The maximum potential intensity is predominantly a function of the background
environment alone (i.e. without a tropical cyclone), and thus this quantity can
be used to determine which regions on Earth can support tropical cyclones of a
given intensity, and how these regions may evolve in time.[32][33]
Specifically, the maximum potential intensity has three components, but its
variability_in_space_and_time is due predominantly to the variability in the
surface-air enthalpy difference component     &#x0394; k   {\displaystyle
\Delta k}  [\Delta k].
*** Derivation ***
A tropical cyclone may be viewed as a heat_engine that converts input heat
energy from the surface into mechanical_energy that can be used to do
mechanical_work against surface friction. At equilibrium, the rate of net
energy production in the system must equal the rate of energy loss due to
frictional dissipation at the surface, i.e.
          W  i n   =  W  o u t     {\displaystyle W_{in}=W_{out}}  [W_{in} = W_
      {out}]
The rate of energy loss per unit surface area from surface friction,      W  o
u t     {\displaystyle W_{out}}  [W_{out}], is given by
          W  o u t   =  C  d   &#x03C1;  |   u    |   3     {\displaystyle W_
      {out}=C_{d}\rho |\mathbf {u} |^{3}}  [W_{out} = C_d \rho |\mathbf{u}|^3]
where     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is the density of near-
surface air ([kg/m3]) and      |   u   |    {\displaystyle |\mathbf {u} |}
[|\mathbf{u}|] is the near surface wind speed ([m/s]).
The rate of energy production per unit surface area,      W  i n
{\displaystyle W_{in}}  [W_{in}] is given by
          W  i n   = &#x03F5;  Q  i n     {\displaystyle W_{in}=\epsilon Q_
      {in}}  [W_{in} = \epsilon Q_{in}]
where     &#x03F5;   {\displaystyle \epsilon }  [\epsilon ] is the heat engine
efficiency and      Q  i n     {\displaystyle Q_{in}}  [Q_{in}] is the total
rate of heat input into the system per unit surface area. Given that a tropical
cyclone may be idealized as a Carnot_heat_engine, the Carnot heat engine
efficiency is given by
         &#x03F5; =     T  s   &#x2212;  T  o     T  s       {\displaystyle
      \epsilon ={\frac {T_{s}-T_{o}}{T_{s}}}}  [\epsilon = \frac{T_s-T_o}{T_s}]
Heat (enthalpy) per unit mass is given by
         k =  C  p   T +  L  v   q   {\displaystyle k=C_{p}T+L_{v}q}  [k = C_pT
      + L_vq]
where      C  p     {\displaystyle C_{p}}  [C_{p}] is the heat capacity of air,
T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] is air temperature,      L  v     {\displaystyle L_
{v}}  [L_{v}] is the latent heat of vaporization, and     q   {\displaystyle q}
[q] is the concentration of water vapor. The first component corresponds to
sensible_heat and the second to latent_heat.
There are two sources of heat input. The dominant source is the input of heat
at the surface, primarily due to evaporation. The bulk aerodynamic formula for
the rate of heat input per unit area at the surface,      Q  i n : k
{\displaystyle Q_{in:k}}  [Q_{in:k}], is given by
          Q  i n : k   =  C  k   &#x03C1;  |   u   |  &#x0394; k
      {\displaystyle Q_{in:k}=C_{k}\rho |\mathbf {u} |\Delta k}  [Q_{in:k} =
      C_k \rho |\mathbf{u}|\Delta k]
where     &#x0394; k =  k  s   &#x2217;   &#x2212; k   {\displaystyle \Delta
k=k_{s}^{*}-k}  [\Delta k = k^*_s-k] represents the enthalpy difference between
the ocean surface and the overlying air. The second source is the internal
sensible heat generated from frictional dissipation (equal to      W  o u t
{\displaystyle W_{out}}  [W_{out}]), which occurs near the surface within the
tropical cyclone and is recycled to the system.

      {\displaystyle Q_{in:friction}=C_{d}\rho |\mathbf {u} |^{3}}  [Q_{in:
      friction} = C_d \rho |\mathbf{u}|^3]
Thus, the total rate of net energy production per unit surface area is given by
          W  i n   =     T  s   &#x2212;  T  o     T  s      (   C  k
      &#x03C1;  |   u   |  &#x0394; k +  C  d   &#x03C1;  |   u    |   3    )
      {\displaystyle W_{in}={\frac {T_{s}-T_{o}}{T_{s}}}\left(C_{k}\rho
      |\mathbf {u} |\Delta k+C_{d}\rho |\mathbf {u} |^{3}\right)}  [W_{in} =
      \frac{T_s-T_o}{T_s}\left(C_k \rho |\mathbf{u}|\Delta k + C_d \rho
      |\mathbf{u}|^3\right)]
Setting      W  i n   =  W  o u t     {\displaystyle W_{in}=W_{out}}  [W_{in} =
W_{out}] and taking      |   u   |  &#x2248; v   {\displaystyle |\mathbf {u}
|\approx v}  [|\mathbf{u}| \approx v] (i.e. the rotational wind speed is
dominant) leads to the solution for      v  p     {\displaystyle v_{p}}  [v_p]
given above. This derivation assumes that total energy input and loss within
the system can be approximated by their values at the radius of maximum wind.
The inclusion of      Q  i n : f r i c t i o n     {\displaystyle Q_{in:
friction}}  [Q_{in:friction}] acts to multiply the total heat input rate by the
factor        T  s    T  o       {\displaystyle {\frac {T_{s}}{T_{o}}}}  [\frac
{T_s}{T_o}]. Mathematically, this has the effect of replacing      T  s
{\displaystyle T_{s}}  [T_{s}] with      T  o     {\displaystyle T_{o}}  [T_
{o}] in the denominator of the Carnot efficiency.
An alternative definition for the maximum potential intensity, which is
mathematically equivalent to the above formulation, is
          v  p   =      T  s    T  o        C  k    C  d     ( C A P  E  s
      &#x2217;   &#x2212; C A P  E  b   )   |   m       {\displaystyle v_{p}=
      {\sqrt {{\frac {T_{s}}{T_{o}}}{\frac {C_{k}}{C_{d}}}(CAPE_{s}^{*}-CAPE_
      {b})|_{m}}}}  [v_p = \sqrt{\frac{T_s}{T_o}\frac{C_k}{C_d}(CAPE^*_s-
      CAPE_b)|_m}]
where CAPE stands for the Convective_Available_Potential_Energy,     C A P  E
s   &#x2217;     {\displaystyle CAPE_{s}^{*}}  [CAPE^*_s] is the CAPE of an air
parcel lifted from saturation at sea level in reference to the environmental
sounding,     C A P  E  b     {\displaystyle CAPE_{b}}  [CAPE_b] is the CAPE of
the boundary layer air, and both quantities are calculated at the radius of
maximum wind.[34]
*** Characteristic values and variability on Earth ***
On Earth, a characteristic temperature for      T  s     {\displaystyle T_{s}}
[T_{s}] is 300 K and for      T  o     {\displaystyle T_{o}}  [T_{o}] is 200 K,
corresponding to a Carnot efficiency of     &#x03F5; = 1  /  3   {\displaystyle
\epsilon =1/3}  [\epsilon = 1/3]. The ratio of the surface exchange
coefficients,      C  k    /   C  d     {\displaystyle C_{k}/C_{d}}  [C_k/C_d],
is typically taken to be 1. However, observations suggest that the drag
coefficient      C  d     {\displaystyle C_{d}}  [C_{d}] varies with wind speed
and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature
hurricane.[35] Additionally,      C  k     {\displaystyle C_{k}}  [C_{k}] may
vary at high wind speeds due to the effect of sea_spray on evaporation within
the boundary layer.[36]
A characteristic value of the maximum potential intensity,      v  p
{\displaystyle v_{p}}  [v_p], is 80 metres per second (180 mph; 290 km/h).
However, this quantity varies significantly across space and time, particularly
within the seasonal_cycle, spanning a range of 0 to 100 metres per second (0 to
224 mph; 0 to 360 km/h).[34] This variability is primarily due to variability
in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium (     &#x0394; k   {\displaystyle \Delta
k}  [\Delta k] ) as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere,
which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate. These
processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and
underlying ocean dynamics), background near-surface wind speed, and the
vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating.[37] The nature of this
modulation is complex, particularly on climate time-scales (decades or longer).
On shorter time-scales, variability in the maximum potential intensity is
commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical
mean, as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more
capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold
water.[38] However, this relationship is indirect via the large-scale dynamics
of the tropics; the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on
v  p     {\displaystyle v_{p}}  [v_p] is weak in comparison.
**** Interaction with the upper ocean ****
Chart displaying the drop in surface temperature in the Gulf_of_Mexico as
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita passed over
The passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the
ocean to cool substantially, which can influence subsequent cyclone
development. This cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold
water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters. This effect
results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or
lead to weakening. Additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from
falling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher
altitudes). Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean, by shielding
the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm
passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea
surface temperature over a large area in just a few days.[39] Conversely, the
mixing of the sea can result in heat being inserted in deeper waters, with
potential_effects on global climate.[40]

There are six Regional_Specialized_Meteorological_Centers (RSMCs) worldwide.
These organizations are designated by the World_Meteorological_Organization and
are responsible for tracking and issuing bulletins, warnings, and advisories
about tropical cyclones in their designated areas of responsibility. In
addition, there are six Tropical_Cyclone_Warning_Centers (TCWCs) that provide
information to smaller regions.[46]
The RSMCs and TCWCs are not the only organizations that provide information
about tropical cyclones to the public. The Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center (JTWC)
issues advisories in all basins except the Northern Atlantic for the purposes
of the United_States_Government.[47] The Philippine_Atmospheric,_Geophysical
and_Astronomical_Services_Administration (PAGASA) issues advisories and names
for tropical cyclones that approach the Philippines in the Northwestern Pacific
to protect the life and property of its citizens.[48] The Canadian_Hurricane
Center (CHC) issues advisories on hurricanes and their remnants for Canadian
citizens when they affect Canada.[49]
On March 26, 2004, Hurricane_Catarina became the first recorded South_Atlantic
cyclone, striking southern Brazil with winds equivalent to Category 2 on the
Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale. As the cyclone formed outside the authority of
another warning center, Brazilian meteorologists initially treated the system
as an extratropical_cyclone, but later on classified it as tropical.[50]

Worldwide, tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer, when the difference
between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest.
However, each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide
scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month.
November is the only month in which all the tropical_cyclone_basins are in
season.[51]
**** Times ****
In the Northern Atlantic_Ocean, a distinct cyclone_season occurs from June 1 to
November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September.[51] The
statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10. The
Northeast Pacific_Ocean has a broader period of activity, but in a similar time
frame to the Atlantic.[52] The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-
round, with a minimum in February and March and a peak in early September.[51]
In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with
peaks in May and November.[51] In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropical cyclone
year begins on July 1 and runs all year-round encompassing the tropical cyclone
seasons, which run from November 1 until the end of April, with peaks in mid-
February to early March.[51][45]

**** Factors ****
Waves in the trade winds in the Atlantic Oceanâareas of converging winds that
move along the same track as the prevailing windâcreate instabilities in the
atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.
The formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research
and is still not fully understood.[56] While six factors appear to be generally
necessary, tropical cyclones may occasionally form without meeting all of the
following conditions. In most situations, water_temperatures of at least
26.5 Â°C (79.7 Â°F) are needed down to a depth of at least 50 m (160 ft);[57]
waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough
to sustain convection and thunderstorms.[58] For tropical transitioning
cyclones (i.e. Hurricane_Ophelia_(2017)) a water temperature of at least
22.5 Â°C (72.5 Â°F) has been suggested.[59]
Another factor is rapid cooling with height, which allows the release of the
heat_of_condensation that powers a tropical cyclone.[57] High humidity is
needed, especially in the lower-to-mid troposphere; when there is a great deal
of moisture in the atmosphere, conditions are more favorable for disturbances
to develop.[57] Low amounts of wind_shear are needed, as high shear is
disruptive to the storm's circulation.[57] Tropical cyclones generally need to
form more than 555 km (345 mi) or five degrees of latitude away from the
equator, allowing the Coriolis_effect to deflect winds blowing towards the low
pressure center and creating a circulation.[57] Lastly, a formative tropical
cyclone needs a preexisting system of disturbed weather. Tropical cyclones will
not form spontaneously.[57] Low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts
associated with the MaddenâJulian_oscillation can create favorable conditions
for tropical cyclogenesis by initiating tropical disturbances.[60]
**** Locations ****
Most tropical cyclones form in a worldwide band of thunderstorm activity near
the equator, referred to as the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical
Convergence_Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon_trough.[61][62][63] Another important
source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical_waves, which contribute
to the development of about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic
Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific.[64][65]
[66] The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the
equator,[67] and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south.[68]
[69] Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation,
tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5 degrees of the equator, where
the effect is weakest.[68] However, it is still possible for tropical systems
to form within this boundary as Tropical_Storm_Vamei and Cyclone_Agni did in
2001 and 2004, respectively.[70][71]
***** Movement *****
The movement of a tropical cyclone (i.e. its "track") is typically approximated
as the sum of two terms: "steering" by the background environmental wind and
"beta drift".[72]
**** Environmental steering ****
Environmental steering is the dominant term. Conceptually, it represents the
movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental
conditions, similar to "leaves carried along by a stream".[73] Physically, the
winds, or flow_field, in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as
having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself, and the large-
scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place. In
this way, tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as
advection of the storm by the local environmental flow. This environmental flow
is termed the "steering flow".
Climatologically, tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-
to-west trade_winds on the equatorial side of the subtropical_ridgeâa
persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans.[73] In the
tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer
tropical_easterly_waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean
Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the
waves dampen out.[65] These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones
within this region.[64] In contrast, in the Indian_Ocean and Western Pacific in
both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly
waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone
and the monsoon trough.[74] Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be
influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.
**** Beta drift ****
In addition to environmental steering, a tropical cyclone will tend to drift
slowly poleward and westward, a motion known as "beta drift". This motion is
due to the superposition of a vortex, such as a tropical cyclone, onto an
environment in which the Coriolis_force varies with latitude, such as on a
sphere or beta_plane. It is induced indirectly by the storm itself, the result
of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and its environment.
Physically, the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air
poleward east of center and equatorial west of center. Because air must
conserve its angular_momentum, this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre
equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward
and eastward of the storm center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to
advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs even if there
is zero environmental flow.
**** Multiple storm interaction ****
Main article: Fujiwhara_effect
A third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the
interaction of multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one
another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between
the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two
vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center
point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex
will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around
it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei_Fujiwhara.
[75]
**** Interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies ****
See also: Westerlies
Storm track of Typhoon_Ioke, showing recurvature off the Japanese coast in 2006
Though a tropical cyclone typically moves from east to west in the tropics, its
track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the
subtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow, such
as the jet_stream or an extratropical_cyclone. This motion, termed
"recurvature", commonly occurs near the western edge of the major ocean basins,
where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and extratropical
cyclones are common.[76] An example of tropical cyclone recurvature was Typhoon
Ioke in 2006.[77]
**** Landfall ****
See also: Tropical_cyclogenesis_Â§ Unusual_areas_of_formation
The landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storm's surface center moves
over a coastline.[10] Storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and
inland hours before landfall; in fact, a tropical cyclone can launch its
strongest winds over land, yet not make landfall. NOAA uses the term "direct
hit" to describe when a location (on the left side of the eye) falls within the
radius of maximum winds (or twice that radius if on the right side), whether or
not the hurricane's eye made landfall.[10]
**** Changes caused by El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation ****
See also: El_NiÃ±oâSouthern_Oscillation
Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the
equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main
belt of the Westerlies.[78] When the subtropical_ridge position shifts due to
El NiÃ±o, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan
and Korea tend to experience much fewer SeptemberâNovember tropical cyclone
impacts during El_NiÃ±o and neutral years. During El NiÃ±o years, the break in
the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130Â°E which would favor the Japanese
archipelago.[79] During El NiÃ±o years, Guam's chance of a tropical cyclone
impact is one-third more likely than of the long-term average.[80] The tropical
Atlantic Ocean experiences depressed activity due to increased vertical wind
shear across the region during El NiÃ±o years.[81] During La_NiÃ±a years, the
formation of tropical cyclones, along with the subtropical ridge position,
shifts westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall
threat to China and much greater intensity in the Philippines.[79]
***** Dissipation *****

**** Factors ****
Tropical_Storm_Franklin, an example of a strongly sheared tropical cyclone in
the North_Atlantic_hurricane basin during 2005
A tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several
different ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the
warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength.[82] Most strong
storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized
areas of low pressure within a day or two, or evolve into extratropical
cyclones. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed
to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane_Ivan. If it remains
over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate.[83] Many storm
fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash
their moisture as torrential rainfall.[84] This rainfall may lead to deadly
floods and mudslides, as was the case with Hurricane_Mitch around Honduras in
October 1998.[85] Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.[86]
A tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below
26.5 Â°C (79.7 Â°F). This will cause the storm to lose its tropical
characteristics, such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center, and
become a remnant low-pressure_area. These remnant systems may persist for up to
several days before losing their identity. This dissipation mechanism is most
common in the eastern North Pacific.[87] Weakening or dissipation can occur if
it experiences vertical wind shear, causing the convection and heat engine to
move away from the center; this normally ceases development of a tropical
cyclone.[88] In addition, its interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies,
by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone, can cause tropical cyclones to
evolve into extratropical_cyclones. This transition can take 1â3 days.[89]
Even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated, it can
still have tropical storm force (or occasionally hurricane/typhoon force) winds
and drop several inches of rainfall. In the Pacific_Ocean and Atlantic_Ocean,
such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may
occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach
the west coast of North America. These phenomena can also affect Europe, where
they are known as European_windstorms; Hurricane_Iris's extratropical remnants
are an example of such a windstorm from 1995.[90] A cyclone can also merge with
another area of low pressure, becoming a larger area of low pressure. This can
strengthen the resultant system, although it may no longer be a tropical
cyclone.[88] Studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large
amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones.[91]
**** Artificial dissipation ****
In the 1960s and 1970s, the United_States_government attempted to weaken
hurricanes through Project_Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver
iodide. It was thought that the seeding would cause supercooled_water in the
outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus
reducing the winds.[92] The winds of Hurricane_Debbieâa hurricane seeded in
Project Stormfuryâdropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength
after each of two seeding forays.[93] In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster
struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville,_Florida promptly changed its
course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah,_Georgia.[94] Because
there was so much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal
government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less
than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number
of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that
eyewall_replacement_cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt
on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide
seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water
in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.[95]
Other approaches have been suggested over time, including cooling the water
under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans.[96] Other
ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation,
[97] dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of
development (so that the latent_heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being
converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop),[96] or
blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons.[98] Project Cirrus even
involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone.[99] These approaches all suffer from
one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and long-
lived for any of the weakening techniques to be practical.[100]
***** Effects *****
The aftermath of Hurricane_Katrina in Gulfport,_Mississippi.
Main article: Effects_of_tropical_cyclones
Tropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves, heavy_rain, flood and high
winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks.
[101] Tropical cyclones stir up water, leaving a cool wake behind them, which
causes the region to be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones.[39] On
land, strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and
other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. The
storm_surge, or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the
worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90%
of tropical cyclone deaths.[102] The broad rotation of a landfalling tropical
cyclone, and vertical wind shear at its periphery, spawns tornadoes. Tornadoes
can also be spawned as a result of eyewall_mesovortices, which persist until
landfall.[103]
Over the past two centuries, tropical cyclones have been responsible for the
deaths of about 1.9 million people worldwide. Large areas of standing water
caused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-borne
illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease
propagation.[102] Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure,
leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the hampering of
reconstruction efforts.[102][104] On average, the Gulf and east coasts of the
United States suffer approximately US$5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage
every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe
hurricanes, category 3 or greater. However, category 3 or greater hurricanes
only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.
[105]
Although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they
may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as
they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.[106]
Tropical cyclones also help maintain the global heat balance by moving warm,
moist tropical air to the middle_latitudes and polar regions,[107] and by
regulating the thermohaline_circulation through upwelling.[108] The storm surge
and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures, but they
also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important
fish breeding locales. Tropical cyclone destruction spurs redevelopment,
greatly increasing local property values.[109]
When hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean, salt is introduced to many
freshwater areas and raises the salinity levels too high for some habitats to
withstand. Some are able to cope with the salt and recycle it back into the
ocean, but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do
not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it. Because of this, some
species of plants and vegetation die due to the excess salt.[110] In addition,
hurricanes can carry toxins and acids onto shore when they make landfall. The
flood water can pick up the toxins from different spills and contaminate the
land that it passes over. The toxins are very harmful to the people and animals
in the area, as well as the environment around them. The flooding water can
also spark many dangerous oil spills.[111]
**** Preparedness and response ****
Main articles: Hurricane_preparedness and Hurricane_response
Hurricane preparedness encompasses the actions and planning taken before a
tropical cyclone strikes to mitigate damage and injury from the storm.
Knowledge of tropical cyclone impacts on an area help plan for future
possibilities. Preparedness may involve preparations made by individuals as
well as centralized efforts by governments or other organizations. Tracking
storms during the tropical cyclone season helps individuals know current
threats. Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone
Warning Centers provide current information and forecasts to help individuals
make the best decision possible.
Hurricane response is the disaster_response after a hurricane. Activities
performed by hurricane responders include assessment, restoration, and
demolition of buildings; removal of debris and waste; repairs to land-based and
maritime infrastructure; and public health services including search_and_rescue
operations.[112] Hurricane response requires coordination between federal,
tribal, state, local, and private entities.[113] According to the National
Voluntary_Organizations_Active_in_Disaster, potential response volunteers
should affiliate with established organizations and should not self-deploy, so
that proper training and support can be provided to mitigate the danger and
stress of response work.[114]
Hurricane responders face many hazards. Hurricane responders may be exposed to
chemical and biological contaminants including stored chemicals, sewage, human
remains, and mold growth encouraged by flooding,[115][116][117] as well as
asbestos and lead that may be present in older buildings.[116][118] Common
injuries arise from falls from heights, such as from a ladder or from level
surfaces; from electrocution in flooded areas, including from backfeed from
portable generators; or from motor_vehicle_accidents.[115][118][119] Long_and
irregular_shifts may lead to sleep_deprivation and fatigue, increasing the risk
of injuries, and workers may experience mental_stress_associated_with_a
traumatic_incident. Additionally, heat_stress is a concern as workers are often
exposed to hot and humid temperatures, wear protective clothing and equipment,
and have physically difficult tasks.[115][118]
***** Observation and forecasting *****
**** Observation ****

"Hurricane Hunter" â WP-3D Orion is used to go into the eye of a hurricane
for data collection and measurements purposes.
Intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge, as they are
a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather_stations, being relatively sparse,
are rarely available on the site of the storm itself. In general, surface
observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a
coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually
taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic
and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of
meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate
their strength at the point of landfall.[120]
Tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by weather_satellites capturing
visible and infrared images from space, usually at half-hour to quarter-hour
intervals. As a storm approaches land, it can be observed by land-based Doppler
weather_radar. Radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm's
location and intensity every several minutes.[121]
In_situ measurements, in real-time, can be taken by sending specially equipped
reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights
are regularly flown by United States government hurricane_hunters.[122] The
aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both four-engine turboprop
cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct
and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS_dropsondes inside
the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and
especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in
hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone
aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's
Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also
completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated a new
way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.[123]
A general decrease in error trends in tropical cyclone path prediction is
evident since the 1970s
**** Forecasting ****
See also: Tropical_cyclone_track_forecasting, Tropical_cyclone_prediction
model, and Tropical_cyclone_rainfall_forecasting
Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track
predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-
pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a
tropical system. The deep layer mean flow, or average wind through the depth of
the troposphere, is considered the best tool in determining track direction and
speed. If storms are significantly sheared, use of wind speed measurements at a
lower altitude, such as at the 70 kPa pressure surface (3,000 metres or 9,800
feet above sea level) will produce better predictions. Tropical forecasters
also consider smoothing out short-term wobbles of the storm as it allows them
to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory.[124] High-speed computers
and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer
models that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and
strength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with
increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones, as well as
with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors,
scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades.
[125] However, scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of
tropical cyclones.[126] The lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is
attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete
understanding of factors that affect their development. New tropical cyclone
position and forecast information is available at least every six hours from
the various warning centers.[46][127][128][129][130]
***** Classifications, terminology, and naming *****
**** Intensity classifications ****
Main article: Tropical_cyclone_scales
Three tropical cyclones of the 2006_Pacific_typhoon_season at different stages
of development. The weakest (left) demonstrates only the most basic circular
shape. A stronger storm (top right) demonstrates spiral_banding and increased
centralization, while the strongest (lower right) has developed an eye.
Around the world, tropical cyclones are classified in different ways, based on
the location, the structure of the system and its intensity. For example,
within the Northern Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins, a tropical cyclone
with wind speeds of over 65 kn (75 mph; 120 km/h) is called a hurricane, while
it is called a typhoon or a severe cyclonic storm within the Western Pacific or
North Indian Oceans.[41][42][43] Within the Southern Hemisphere, it is either
called a hurricane, tropical cyclone or a severe tropical cyclone, depending on
if its located within the South Atlantic, South-West Indian Ocean, Australian
region or the South Pacific Ocean.[44][45] If a tropical cyclone moves from one
basin to another, then it is generally classified using that basins
terminology.

**** Identification codes ****
Tropical cyclones that develop around the world are assigned an identification
code consisting of a two-digit number and suffix letter by the warning centers
that monitor them. These codes start at 01 every year and are assigned in order
to systems, which have the potential to develop further, cause significant
impact to life and property or when the warning centers start to write
advisories on the system.[45][131]

|      coordination with the NRL's Marine Meteorological Division.[138]       |
|   5. ^ Although UKMet does not issue warnings for the South Atlantic basin, |

The practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years,
with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of
naming.[140][141] The system currently used provides positive identification of
severe weather systems in a brief form, that is readily understood and
recognized by the public.[140][141] The credit for the first usage of personal
names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland_Government
Meteorologist Clement_Wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907.[140][141]
This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several
years after Wragge retired, until it was revived in the latter part of World
War_II for the Western Pacific.[140][141] Formal naming schemes have
subsequently been introduced for the North_and_South_Atlantic,_Eastern,
Central,_Western_and_Southern_Pacific_basins as well as the Australian_region
and Indian_Ocean.[141]
At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven
meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to
provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public
regarding forecasts, watches, and warnings.[140] Since the systems can last a
week or longer and more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same
time, the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is being
described.[140] Names are assigned in order from predetermined lists with one,
three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65 km/h (40 mph)
depending on which basin it originates.[41][43][44] However, standards vary
from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the Western
Pacific, while tropical cyclones have to have a significant amount of gale-
force winds occurring around the center before they are named within the
Southern_Hemisphere.[44][45] The names of significant tropical cyclones in the
North Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Australian region are retired from the
naming lists and replaced with another name.[41][42][45]

and List_of_Pacific_hurricanes
Tropical cyclones that cause extreme destruction are rare, although when they
occur, they can cause great amounts of damage or thousands of fatalities.
Flooding after 1991_Bangladesh_cyclone, which killed around 140,000 people.
The 1970_Bhola_cyclone is considered to be the deadliest tropical cyclone on
record, which killed around 300,000 people, after striking the densely
populated Ganges_Delta region of Bangladesh on November 13, 1970.[142] Its
powerful storm surge was responsible for the high death toll.[143] The North
Indian_cyclone_basin has historically been the deadliest basin.[102][144]
Elsewhere, Typhoon_Nina killed nearly 100,000 in China in 1975 due to a 100-
year_flood that caused 62 dams including the Banqiao_Dam to fail.[145] The
Great_Hurricane_of_1780 is the deadliest North_Atlantic_hurricane on record,
killing about 22,000 people in the Lesser_Antilles.[146] A tropical cyclone
does not need to be particularly strong to cause memorable damage, primarily if
the deaths are from rainfall or mudslides. Tropical_Storm_Thelma in November
1991 killed thousands in the Philippines,[147] although the strongest typhoon
to ever make landfall on record was Typhoon_Haiyan in November 2013, causing
widespread devastation in Eastern_Visayas, and killing at least 6,300 people in
the Philippines alone. In 1982, the unnamed tropical depression that eventually
became Hurricane_Paul killed around 1,000 people in Central_America.[148]
Hurricane_Harvey and Hurricane_Katrina are estimated to be the costliest
tropical cyclones to impact the United States mainland, each causing damage
estimated at $125 billion.[149] Harvey killed at least 90 people in August 2017
after making landfall in Texas as a low-end_Category_4_hurricane. Hurricane
Katrina is estimated as the second-costliest tropical cyclone worldwide,[150]
causing $81.2 billion in property damage (2008 USD) alone,[151] with overall
damage estimates exceeding $100 billion (2005 USD).[150] Katrina killed at
least 1,836 people after striking Louisiana and Mississippi as a major
hurricane in August 2005.[151] Hurricane_Maria is the third most destructive
tropical cyclone in U.S history, with damage totaling $91.61 billion
(2017 USD), and with damage costs at $68.7 billion (2012 USD), Hurricane_Sandy
is the fourth most destructive tropical cyclone in U.S history. The Galveston
Hurricane_of_1900 is the deadliest natural disaster in the United States,
killing an estimated 6,000 to 12,000 people in Galveston,_Texas.[152] Hurricane
Mitch caused more than 10,000 fatalities in Central_America, making it the
second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history. Hurricane_Iniki in 1992 was the
most powerful storm to strike Hawaii in recorded history, hitting Kauai as a
Category 4 hurricane, killing six people, and causing U.S. $3 billion in
damage.[153] Other destructive Eastern Pacific_hurricanes include Pauline and
Kenna, both causing severe damage after striking Mexico as major hurricanes.
[154][155] In March 2004, Cyclone_Gafilo struck northeastern Madagascar as a
powerful cyclone, killing 74, affecting more than 200,000, and becoming the
worst cyclone to affect the nation for more than 20 years.[156]
The relative sizes of Typhoon_Tip, Cyclone_Tracy, and the Contiguous_United
States
The most intense storm on record was Typhoon_Tip in the northwestern Pacific
Ocean in 1979, which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals
(25.69 inHg) and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165 knots (85 m/s) or 190
miles per hour (310 km/h).[157] The highest maximum sustained wind speed ever
recorded was 185 knots (95 m/s) or 215 miles per hour (346 km/h) in Hurricane
Patricia in 2015, which is the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the
Western Hemisphere.[158] Typhoon_Nancy in 1961 also had recorded wind speeds of
185 knots (95 m/s) or 215 miles per hour (346 km/h), but recent research
indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high,
and this is no longer considered the storm with the highest wind speeds on
record.[159] Likewise, a surface-level gust caused by Typhoon_Paka on Guam in
late 1997 was recorded at 205 knots (105 m/s) or 235 miles per hour (378 km/h).
Had it been confirmed, it would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever
recorded on the Earth's surface, but the reading had to be discarded since the
anemometer was damaged by the storm.[160] The World_Meteorological_Organization
established Barrow_Island_(Queensland) as the location of the highest non-
tornado related wind gust at 408 kilometres per hour (254 mph)[161] on April
10, 1996 during Severe_Tropical_Cyclone_Olivia.[162]
In addition to being the most intense tropical cyclone on record based on
pressure, Tip was the largest cyclone on record, with tropical storm-force
winds 2,170 kilometres (1,350 mi) in diameter. The smallest storm on record,
Tropical_Storm_Marco, formed during October 2008 and making landfall in
Veracruz. Marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres (23 mi)
in diameter.[163]
Hurricane_John is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, lasting
31 days in 1994. Before the advent of satellite imagery in 1961, however, many
tropical cyclones were underestimated in their durations.[164] John is also the
longest-tracked tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere on record, which
had a path of 8,250 mi (13,280 km).[165] Cyclone_Rewa of the 1993â94_South
Pacific and Australian_region cyclone seasons had one of the longest tracks
observed within the Southern Hemisphere, traveling a distance of over 5,545 mi
(8,920 km) during December 1993 and January 1994.[165]
***** Long-term activity trends *****
See also: Atlantic_hurricane_reanalysis
Atlantic Multidecadal Cycle since 1950, using accumulated_cyclone_energy (ACE)
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation Timeseries, 1856â2013
While the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995, there is
no obvious global trend; the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide
remains about 87 Â± 10 (Between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually). However,
the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins
is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins, primarily in
the Southern Hemisphere,[166] while noting that a significant downward trend in
tropical cyclone numbers has been identified for the region near Australia
(based on high quality data and accounting for the influence of the El NiÃ±o-
Southern Oscillation).[167] In spite of that, there is some evidence that the
intensity of hurricanes is increasing. Kerry_Emanuel stated, "Records of
hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in
and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane
(again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around
70% in the past 30 years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the
maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime."[168]
Atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially, as evidenced by the
fact that five of the ten most_expensive_storms_in_United_States_history have
occurred since 1990. According to the World_Meteorological_Organization,
"recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has been caused
largely by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal
regions."[169] Political scientist Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland US
hurricane damage from 1900â2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend
of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the
extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade
1996â2005 was the second most damaging among the past 11 decades, with only
the decade 1926â1935 surpassing its costs.
Often in part because of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had
sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism;
therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have
gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and
remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official
record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite
meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and
strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as
suspect.[170]
The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50â70 year
cycle, also known as the Atlantic_Multidecadal_Oscillation. Nyberg et al.
reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century
and found five periods averaging 3â5 major hurricanes per year and lasting
40â60 years, and six other averaging 1.5â2.5 major hurricanes per year and
lasting 10â20 years. These periods are associated with the Atlantic
multidecadal oscillation. Throughout, a decadal oscillation related to solar
irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major
hurricanes by 1â2 per year.[171]
Although more common since 1995, few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred
during 1970â94.[172] Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to
1960, including many major New_England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical
storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28
storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of
1900â25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870â99. During the
1887_season, 19 tropical storms formed, of which a record 4 occurred after
November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the
1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an
1821_storm that made a direct hit on New_York_City. Some historical weather
experts say these storms may have been as high as Category_4 in strength.[173]
These active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic
basin. Before the satellite era began in 1960, tropical storms or hurricanes
went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one, a ship
reported a voyage through the storm, or a storm hit land in a populated area.
[170]
Proxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major
hurricane activity along the Gulf_of_Mexico coast varies on timescales of
centuries to millennia.[174][175] Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast
during 3000â1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These
quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and
1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes
and their landfall probabilities increased by 3â5 times. This millennial-
scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of
the Azores_High,[175] which may also be linked to changes in the strength of
the North_Atlantic_oscillation.[176]
According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase pattern is expected to
exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the
quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would
result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the
hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the
Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean.
Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic
evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C
years BP,[177] and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great_Plains
during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi_Valley
through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem
to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal
lake in Cape_Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly
during the past 500â1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent
period of the last millennium.
**** Climate change ****
Main article: Tropical_cyclones_and_climate_change
The 2007 IPCC report noted many observed changes in the climate, including
atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean conditions, and
others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone
intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition, the report
considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase
through the 21st century, and declared it more likely than not that there has
been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.
[178]
P.J. Webster and others published in 2005 an article in Science examining the
"changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity" over the past
35 years, the period when satellite data has been available. Their main finding
was although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding
the north Atlantic_Ocean, there was a great increase in the number and
proportion of very strong cyclones.[179]
According to 2006 studies by the National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric
Administration, "the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be
upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth's
climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere".
[180]
Studies published since 2008, by Kerry_Emanuel from MIT, indicate that global
warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of
hurricane and cyclone activity.[181] In an article in Nature, Kerry Emanuel
stated that potential hurricane destructiveness, a measure combining hurricane
strength, duration, and frequency, "is highly correlated with tropical sea
surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including
multidecadal_oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global
warming". Emanuel predicted "a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses
in the twenty-first century".[182]
Research reported in the September 3, 2008 issue of Nature found that the
strongest tropical cyclones are getting stronger, in particular over the North
Atlantic and Indian oceans. Wind speeds for the strongest tropical storms
increased from an average of 225 km/h (140 mph) in 1981 to 251 km/h (156 mph)
in 2006, while the ocean temperature, averaged globally over all the regions
where tropical cyclones form, increased from 28.2 Â°C (82.8 Â°F) to 28.5 Â°C
(83.3 Â°F) during this period.[183][184]
A 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods, storm surge, and
terrestrial flooding (rivers), and projects an increase due_to_global_warming.
[185][186]
***** Related cyclone types *****
Gustav on September 9, 2002, the first system to be given a name as a
subtropical cyclone
See also: Cyclone, Extratropical_cyclone, and Subtropical_cyclone
In addition to tropical cyclones, there are two other classes of cyclones
within the spectrum of cyclone types. These kinds of cyclones, known as
extratropical_cyclones and subtropical_cyclones, can be stages a tropical
cyclone passes through during its formation or dissipation.[187] An
extratropical cyclone is a storm that derives energy from horizontal
temperature differences, which are typical in higher latitudes. A tropical
cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its
energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in
temperature between air masses; although not as frequently, an extratropical
cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical
cyclone.[188] From space, extratropical storms have a characteristic "comma-
shaped" cloud pattern.[189] Extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous when
their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds and high seas.[190]
A subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a
tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can
form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50Â°. Although
subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical
in nature as their cores warm.[191] From an operational standpoint, a tropical
cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its
extratropical transition.[192]
***** Popular culture *****
Main article: Tropical_cyclones_in_popular_culture
In popular_culture, tropical cyclones have made several appearances in
different types of media, including films, books, television, music, and
electronic_games.[193] These media often portray tropical cyclones that are
either entirely fictional or based on real events.[193] For example, George
Rippey_Stewart's Storm, a best-seller published in 1941, is thought to have
influenced meteorologists on their decision to assign female names to Pacific
tropical cyclones.[141] Another example is the hurricane in The_Perfect_Storm,
which describes the sinking of the Andrea_Gail by the 1991_Perfect_Storm.[194]
Hypothetical hurricanes have been featured in parts of the plots of series such
as The_Simpsons, Invasion, Family_Guy, Seinfeld, Dawson's_Creek, Burn_Notice
and CSI:_Miami.[193][195][196][197][198][199] The 2004 film The_Day_After
Tomorrow includes several mentions of actual tropical cyclones and features
fantastical "hurricane-like", albeit non-tropical, Arctic storms.[200][201]

      January 19, 2009. The weight of available evidence suggests that
      multidecadal variability of hurricane season tropical Atlantic SST and
      Northern Hemispheric surface temperature... is controlled mostly by time-
      varying radiative forcing owing to solar variability, major volcanic
      eruptions, and anthropogenic sulfate aerosols and greenhouse gases,
      though the response to this forcing may be modulated by natural modes of
      variability.
