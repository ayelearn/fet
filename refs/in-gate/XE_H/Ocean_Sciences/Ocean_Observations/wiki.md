***** Accuracy of measurements[edit] *****
The quality of in situ measurements is non-uniform across space, time and
platforms. Different platforms employ a large variety of sensors, which operate
in a wide range of often hostile environments and use different measurement
protocols. Occasionally, buoys are left unattended for extended periods of
time, while ships may involve a certain amount of the human-related impacts in
data collection and transmission.[2] Therefore, quality control is necessary
before in situ data can be further used in scientific research or other
applications. This is an example of quality control and monitoring of sea
surface temperatures measured by ships and buoys, the iQuam system developed at
NOAA/NESDIS/STAR,[3] where statistics show the quality of in situ measurements
of sea surface temperatures.
One of the problems facing real-time ocean observatories is the ability to
provide a fast and accurate assessment of the data quality. Ocean Networks
Canada is in the process of implementing real-time quality control on incoming
data. For scalar data, the aim is to meet the guidelines of the Quality
Assurance of Real Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD) group. QARTOD is a US
organization tasked with identifying issues involved with incoming real-time
data from the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). A large portion of
their agenda is to create guidelines for how the quality of real-time data is
to be determined and reported to the scientific community. Real-time data
quality testing at Ocean Networks Canada includes tests designed to catch
instrument failures and major spikes or data dropouts before the data is made
available to the user. Real-time quality tests include meeting instrument
manufacturer's standards and overall observatory/site ranges determined from
previous data. Due to the positioning of some instrument platforms in highly
productive areas, we have also designed dual-sensor tests e.g. for some
conductivity sensors. The quality control testing is split into 3 separate
categories. The first category is in real-time and tests the data before the
data are parsed into the database. The second category is delayed-mode testing
where archived data are subject to testing after a certain period of time. The
third category is manual quality control by an Ocean Networks Canada data
expert.
***** Historical data available[edit] *****
OceanSITES [4] manages a set of links to various sources of available ocean
data, including: the Hawaiian Ocean Timeseries (HOT),[5] the JAMSTEC Kuroshio
Extension Observatory (JKEO),[6] Line W monitoring the North Atlantic's deep
western boundary current,[7] and others.
This site includes links to the ARGO Float Data, The Data Library and Archives
(DLA), the Falmouth Monthly Climate Reports, Martha's Vineyard Coastal
Observatory, the Multibeam Archive, the Seafloor Data and Observation
Visualization Environment (SeaDOVE): A Web-served GIS Database of Multi-scalar
Seafloor Data, Seafloor Sediments Data Collection, the Upper Ocean Mooring Data
Archive, the U.S. GLOBEC Data System, U.S. JGOFS Data System, and the WHOI Ship
Data-Grabber System.
There are a variety of data sets in a data library listed at Columbia
University:[8]
This library includes:
    * LEVITUS94 is the World Ocean Atlas as of 1994, an atlas of objectively
      analyzed fields of major ocean parameters at the annual, seasonal, and
      monthly time scales. It is superseded by WOA98.
    * NOAA NODC WOA98 is the World Ocean Atlas as of 1998, an atlas of
      objectively analyzed fields of major ocean parameters at monthly,
      seasonal, and annual time scales. Superseded by WOA01.
    * NOAA NODC WOA01 is the World Ocean Atlas 2001, an atlas of objectively
      analyzed fields of major ocean parameters at monthly, seasonal, and
      annual time scales. Replaced by WOA05.
    * NOAA NODC WOA05 is the World Ocean Atlas 2005, an atlas of objectively
      analyzed fields of major ocean parameters at monthly, seasonal, and
      annual time scales.
In situ observations spanning from the early 1700s to present are available
from the International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS).
This data set includes observations of a number of the surface ocean and
atmospheric variables from ships, moored and drifting buoys and C-MAN stations.
In 2006, Ocean_Networks_Canada began collecting high-resolution in-situ
measurements from the seafloor in Saanich_Inlet, near Victoria,_British
Columbia, Canada.[9] Monitoring sites were later extended to the Strait of
Georgia[10] and 5 locations off the West coast of Vancouver_Island, British
Columbia, Canada. All historical measurements are freely available via Ocean
Networks Canada's data portal, Oceans 2.0.[11]
***** Future developments[edit] *****
Areas requiring research and development[12]
    * Satellite observations with higher resolution and accuracy and more
      spectral bands from geostationary satellites
    * improved capability for ocean color observations in coastal and turbid
      waters
    * improved interpretation of sea-ice data from satellites
    * satellite measurement of salinity
    * Observing system evaluation and design, including improvements in air-sea
      flux parameterizations.
    * Improvements in ocean platforms, including increased capabilities for
      Argo floats
    * improved glider technology and mooring technology.
    * New development in ocean sensors and systems, including improved bio-
      fouling protection, autonomous water sampling systems, optical and
      acoustic systems, airborne variable sensors, and two-way, low-cost, low-
      power telecommunications.
    * New and improved capability to measure biogeochemical variables,
      nutrients, and dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as to
      identify organisms.
    * Improved instruments, including near-surface current meters, in-water
      radiometers, sensors for air-sea interface variables and turbulent
      fluxes, and VOS sensor systems.
The future of oceanic observation systems:
    * Guided unmanned underwater vehicles[13]
