Mass is both a property of a physical_body and a measure of its resistance to
acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net_force is applied.[1]
An object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction
to other bodies.
The basic SI_unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). In physics, mass is not the
same as weight, even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's
weight using a spring_scale, rather than balance_scale comparing it directly
with known masses. An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth
because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass. This is
because weight is a force, while mass is the property that (along with gravity)
determines the strength of this force.

***** Phenomena *****
There are several distinct phenomena which can be used to measure mass.
Although some theorists have speculated that some of these phenomena could be
independent of each other,[2] current experiments have found no difference in
results regardless of how it is measured:
    * Inertial mass measures an object's resistance to being accelerated by a
      force (represented by the relationship F = ma).
    * Active gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted by an
      object.
    * Passive gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted on an
      object in a known gravitational field.
The mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied
force. The inertia and the inertial mass describe the same properties of
physical bodies at the qualitative and quantitative level respectively, by
other words, the mass quantitatively describes the inertia. According to
Newton's_second_law_of_motion, if a body of fixed mass m is subjected to a
single force F, its acceleration a is given by F/m. A body's mass also
determines the degree to which it generates or is affected by a gravitational
field. If a first body of mass mA is placed at a distance r (center of mass to
center of mass) from a second body of mass mB, each body is subject to an
attractive force Fg = GmAmB/r2, where G = 6.67Ã10â11 N kgâ2 m2 is the
"universal gravitational_constant". This is sometimes referred to as
gravitational mass.[note_1] Repeated experiments since the 17th century have
demonstrated that inertial and gravitational mass are identical; since 1915,
this observation has been entailed a_priori in the equivalence_principle of
general_relativity.
***** Units of mass *****
Further information: Orders_of_magnitude_(mass)
The kilogram is one of the seven SI_base_units and one of three which is
defined ad hoc (i.e. without reference to another base unit).
The standard International_System_of_Units (SI) unit of mass is the kilogram
(kg). The kilogram is 1000 grams (g), first defined in 1795 as one cubic
decimeter of water at the melting_point of ice. However, because precise
measurement of a cubic decimeter of water at the proper temperature and
pressure was difficult, in 1889 the kilogram was redefined as the mass of the
international_prototype_kilogram of cast iron, and thus became independent of
the meter and the properties of water.
However, the mass of the international prototype and its supposedly identical
national copies have been found to be drifting over time. It is expected that
the re-definition_of_the_kilogram_and_several_other_units will occur on May 20,
2019, following a final vote by the CGPM in November 2018.[3] The new
definition will use only invariant quantities of nature: the speed_of_light,
the caesium_hyperfine_frequency, and the Planck_constant.[4]
Other units are accepted for use in SI:
    * the tonne (t) (or "metric ton") is equal to 1000 kg.
    * the electronvolt (eV) is a unit of energy, but because of the
      massâenergy_equivalence it can easily be converted to a unit of mass,
      and is often used like one. In this context, the mass has units of eV/c2
      (where c is the speed of light). The electronvolt and its multiples, such
      as the MeV (megaelectronvolt), are commonly used in particle_physics.
    * the atomic_mass_unit (u) is 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom,
      approximately 1.66Ã10â27 kg.[note_2] The atomic mass unit is
      convenient for expressing the masses of atoms and molecules.
Outside the SI system, other units of mass include:
    * the slug (sl) is an Imperial_unit of mass (about 14.6 kg).
    * the pound (lb) is a unit of both mass and force, used mainly in the
      United States (about 0.45 kg or 4.5 N). In scientific contexts where
      pound_(force) and pound_(mass) need to be distinguished, SI units are
      usually used instead.
    * the Planck_mass (mP) is the maximum mass of point particles (about
      2.18Ã10â8 kg). It is used in particle_physics.
    * the solar_mass (M&#x2609;) is defined as the mass of the Sun. It is
      primarily used in astronomy to compare large masses such as stars or
      galaxies (â1.99Ã1030 kg).
    * the mass of a very small particle may be identified by its inverse
      Compton_wavelength (1 cmâ1 â 3.52Ã10â41 kg).
    * the mass of a very large star or black_hole may be identified with its
      Schwarzschild_radius (1 cm â 6.73Ã1024 kg).
***** Definitions *****
The relation between properties of mass and their associated physical
constants. Every massive object is believed to exhibit all five properties.
However, due to extremely large or extremely small constants, it is generally
impossible to verify more than two or three properties for any object.
    * The Schwarzschild_radius (rs) represents the ability of mass to cause
      curvature in space and time.
    * The standard_gravitational_parameter (μ) represents the ability of a
      massive body to exert Newtonian gravitational forces on other bodies.
    * Inertial mass (m) represents the Newtonian response of mass to forces.
    * Rest_energy (E0) represents the ability of mass to be converted into
      other forms of energy.
    * The Compton_wavelength (λ) represents the quantum response of mass to
      local geometry.
In physical_science, one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven
different aspects of mass, or seven physical notions that involve the concept
of mass.[5] Every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be
proportional, and in some cases equal, and this proportionality gives rise to
the abstract concept of mass. There are a number of ways mass can be measured
or operationally_defined:
    * Inertial mass is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration when
      a force is applied. It is determined by applying a force to an object and
      measuring the acceleration that results from that force. An object with
      small inertial mass will accelerate more than an object with large
      inertial mass when acted upon by the same force. One says the body of
      greater mass has greater inertia.
    * Active gravitational mass[note_3] is a measure of the strength of an
      object's gravitational_flux (gravitational flux is equal to the surface
      integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface). Gravitational
      field can be measured by allowing a small "test object" to fall freely
      and measuring its free-fall acceleration. For example, an object in free
      fall near the Moon is subject to a smaller gravitational field, and hence
      accelerates more slowly, than the same object would if it were in free
      fall near the Earth. The gravitational field near the Moon is weaker
      because the Moon has less active gravitational mass.
    * Passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object's
      interaction with a gravitational_field. Passive gravitational mass is
      determined by dividing an object's weight by its free-fall acceleration.
      Two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same
      acceleration; however, the object with a smaller passive gravitational
      mass will experience a smaller force (less weight) than the object with a
      larger passive gravitational mass.
    * Energy also has mass according to the principle of massâenergy
      equivalence. This equivalence is exemplified in a large number of
      physical processes including pair_production, nuclear_fusion, and the
      gravitational bending_of_light. Pair production and nuclear fusion are
      processes in which measurable amounts of mass are converted to energy, or
      vice versa. In the gravitational bending of light, photons of pure energy
      are shown to exhibit a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass.
    * Curvature of spacetime is a relativistic manifestation of the existence
      of mass. Such curvature is extremely weak and difficult to measure. For
      this reason, curvature was not discovered until after it was predicted by
      Einstein's theory of general relativity. Extremely precise atomic_clocks
      on the surface of the Earth, for example, are found to measure less time
      (run slower) when compared to similar clocks in space. This difference in
      elapsed time is a form of curvature called gravitational_time_dilation.
      Other forms of curvature have been measured using the Gravity_Probe_B
      satellite.
    * Quantum mass manifests itself as a difference between an object's quantum
      frequency and its wave_number. The quantum mass of an electron, the
      Compton_wavelength, can be determined through various forms of
      spectroscopy and is closely related to the Rydberg_constant, the Bohr
      radius, and the classical_electron_radius. The quantum mass of larger
      objects can be directly measured using a Kibble_balance. In relativistic
      quantum mechanics, mass is one of the irreducible representation labels
      of the PoincarÃ© group.
**** Weight vs. mass ****
Main article: Mass_versus_weight
In everyday usage, mass and "weight" are often used interchangeably. For
instance, a person's weight may be stated as 75 kg. In a constant gravitational
field, the weight of an object is proportional to its mass, and it is
unproblematic to use the same unit for both concepts. But because of slight
differences in the strength of the Earth's_gravitational_field at different
places, the distinction becomes important for measurements with a precision
better than a few percent, and for places far from the surface of the Earth,
such as in space or on other planets. Conceptually, "mass" (measured in
kilograms) refers to an intrinsic property of an object, whereas "weight"
(measured in newtons) measures an object's resistance to deviating from its
natural course of free_fall, which can be influenced by the nearby
gravitational field. No matter how strong the gravitational field, objects in
free fall are weightless, though they still have mass.[6]
The force known as "weight" is proportional to mass and acceleration in all
situations where the mass is accelerated away from free fall. For example, when
a body is at rest in a gravitational field (rather than in free fall), it must
be accelerated by a force from a scale or the surface of a planetary body such
as the Earth or the Moon. This force keeps the object from going into free
fall. Weight is the opposing force in such circumstances, and is thus
determined by the acceleration of free fall. On the surface of the Earth, for
example, an object with a mass of 50 kilograms weighs 491 newtons, which means
that 491 newtons is being applied to keep the object from going into free fall.
By contrast, on the surface of the Moon, the same object still has a mass of
50 kilograms but weighs only 81.5 newtons, because only 81.5 newtons is
required to keep this object from going into a free fall on the moon. Restated
in mathematical terms, on the surface of the Earth, the weight W of an object
is related to its mass m by W = mg, where g = 9.80665 m/s2 is the acceleration
due to Earth's_gravitational_field, (expressed as the acceleration experienced
by a free-falling object).
For other situations, such as when objects are subjected to mechanical
accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface, the
weight force is proportional to the mass of an object multiplied by the total
acceleration away from free fall, which is called the proper_acceleration.
Through such mechanisms, objects in elevators, vehicles, centrifuges, and the
like, may experience weight forces many times those caused by resistance to the
effects of gravity on objects, resulting from planetary surfaces. In such
cases, the generalized equation for weight W of an object is related to its
mass m by the equation W = âma, where a is the proper acceleration of the
object caused by all influences other than gravity. (Again, if gravity is the
only influence, such as occurs when an object falls freely, its weight will be
zero).
**** Inertial vs. gravitational mass ****
Although inertial mass, passive gravitational mass and active gravitational
mass are conceptually distinct, no experiment has ever unambiguously
demonstrated any difference between them. In classical_mechanics, Newton's
third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be
identical (or at least proportional), but the classical theory offers no
compelling reason why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass.
That it does is merely an empirical fact.
Albert_Einstein developed his general_theory_of_relativity starting with the
assumption of the intentionality of correspondence between inertial and passive
gravitational mass, and that no experiment will ever detect a difference
between them, in essence the equivalence_principle.
This particular equivalence often referred to as the "Galilean equivalence
principle" or the "weak_equivalence_principle" has the most important
consequence for freely falling objects. Suppose an object has inertial and
gravitational masses m and M, respectively. If the only force acting on the
object comes from a gravitational field g, the force on the object is:
         F = M g .   {\displaystyle F=Mg.}  [{\displaystyle F=Mg.}]
Given this force, the acceleration of the object can be determined by Newton's
second law:
         F = m a .   {\displaystyle F=ma.}  [{\displaystyle F=ma.}]
Putting these together, the gravitational acceleration is given by:
         a =   M m   g .   {\displaystyle a={\frac {M}{m}}g.}  [a={\frac {M}
      {m}}g.]
This says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is
equal to some constant K if_and_only_if all objects fall at the same rate in a
given gravitational field. This phenomenon is referred to as the "universality
of free-fall". In addition, the constant K can be taken as 1 by defining our
units appropriately.
The first experiments demonstrating the universality of free-fall
wereâaccording to scientific âfolkloreââconducted by Galileo obtained
by dropping objects from the Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa. This is most likely
apocryphal: he is more likely to have performed his experiments with balls
rolling down nearly frictionless inclined_planes to slow the motion and
increase the timing accuracy. Increasingly precise experiments have been
performed, such as those performed by LorÃ¡nd_EÃ¶tvÃ¶s,[7] using the torsion
balance pendulum, in 1889. As of 2008[update], no deviation from universality,
and thus from Galilean equivalence, has ever been found, at least to the
precision 10â12. More precise experimental efforts are still being carried
out.[citation_needed]
The universality of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the
only acting force. All other forces, especially friction and air_resistance,
must be absent or at least negligible. For example, if a hammer and a feather
are dropped from the same height through the air on Earth, the feather will
take much longer to reach the ground; the feather is not really in free-fall
because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable
to the downward force of gravity. On the other hand, if the experiment is
performed in a vacuum, in which there is no air resistance, the hammer and the
feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time (assuming the
acceleration of both objects towards each other, and of the ground towards both
objects, for its own part, is negligible). This can easily be done in a high
school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the
air removed with a vacuum pump. It is even more dramatic when done in an
environment that naturally has a vacuum, as David_Scott did on the surface of
the Moon during Apollo_15.
A stronger version of the equivalence principle, known as the Einstein
equivalence principle or the strong equivalence principle, lies at the heart of
the general_theory_of_relativity. Einstein's equivalence principle states that
within sufficiently small regions of space-time, it is impossible to
distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field.
Thus, the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by
a gravitational field is a result of the object's tendency to move in a
straight line (in other words its inertia) and should therefore be a function
of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field.
**** Origin ****
Main article: Mass_generation_mechanism
In theoretical_physics, a mass_generation_mechanism is a theory which attempts
to explain the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of physics. To
date, a number of different models have been proposed which advocate different
views of the origin of mass. The problem is complicated by the fact that the
notion of mass is strongly related to the gravitational_interaction but a
theory of the latter has not been yet reconciled with the currently popular
model of particle_physics, known as the Standard_Model.
***** Pre-Newtonian concepts *****
**** Weight as an amount ****
Main article: weight
Depiction of early balance_scales in the Papyrus_of_Hunefer (dated to the 19th
dynasty, c. 1285 BCE). The scene shows Anubis weighing the heart of Hunefer.
The concept of amount is very old and predates_recorded_history. Humans, at
some early era, realized that the weight of a collection of similar objects was
directly_proportional to the number of objects in the collection:
          W  n   &#x221D; n ,   {\displaystyle W_{n}\propto n,}  [W_{n}\propto
      n,]
where W is the weight of the collection of similar objects and n is the number
of objects in the collection. Proportionality, by definition, implies that two
values have a constant ratio:
            W  n   n   =    W  m   m     {\displaystyle {\frac {W_{n}}{n}}=
      {\frac {W_{m}}{m}}}  [{\frac {W_{n}}{n}}={\frac {W_{m}}{m}}], or
      equivalently        W  n    W  m     =   n m   .   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {W_{n}}{W_{m}}}={\frac {n}{m}}.}  [{\frac {W_{n}}{W_{m}}}={\frac {n}
      {m}}.]
An early use of this relationship is a balance_scale, which balances the force
of one object's weight against the force of another object's weight. The two
sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar
gravitational fields. Hence, if they have similar masses then their weights
will also be similar. This allows the scale, by comparing weights, to also
compare masses.
Consequently, historical weight standards were often defined in terms of
amounts. The Romans, for example, used the carob seed (carat or siliqua) as a
measurement standard. If an object's weight was equivalent to 1728_carob_seeds,
then the object was said to weigh one Roman pound. If, on the other hand, the
object's weight was equivalent to 144_carob_seeds then the object was said to
weigh one Roman ounce (uncia). The Roman pound and ounce were both defined in
terms of different sized collections of the same common mass standard, the
carob seed. The ratio of a Roman ounce (144 carob seeds) to a Roman pound (1728
carob seeds) was:
            o u n c e   p o u n d    =    W  144    W  1728     =   144 1728
      =   1 12   .   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {ounce} }{\mathrm {pound}
      }}={\frac {W_{144}}{W_{1728}}}={\frac {144}{1728}}={\frac {1}{12}}.}  [
      {\frac {\mathrm {ounce} }{\mathrm {pound} }}={\frac {W_{144}}{W_{1728}}}=
      {\frac {144}{1728}}={\frac {1}{12}}.]
**** Planetary motion ****
See also: Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion
In 1600 AD, Johannes_Kepler sought employment with Tycho_Brahe, who had some of
the most precise astronomical data available. Using Brahe's precise
observations of the planet Mars, Kepler spent the next five years developing
his own method for characterizing planetary motion. In 1609, Johannes Kepler
published his three laws of planetary motion, explaining how the planets orbit
the Sun. In Kepler's final planetary model, he described planetary orbits as
following elliptical paths with the Sun at a focal point of the ellipse. Kepler
discovered that the square of the orbital_period of each planet is directly
proportional to the cube of the semi-major_axis of its orbit, or equivalently,
that the ratio of these two values is constant for all planets in the Solar
System.[note_4]
On 25 August 1609, Galileo_Galilei demonstrated his first telescope to a group
of Venetian merchants, and in early January 1610, Galileo observed four dim
objects near Jupiter, which he mistook for stars. However, after a few days of
observation, Galileo realized that these "stars" were in fact orbiting Jupiter.
These four objects (later named the Galilean_moons in honor of their
discoverer) were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit something other
than the Earth or Sun. Galileo continued to observe these moons over the next
eighteen months, and by the middle of 1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate
estimates for their periods.
**** Galilean free fall ****
Galileo Galilei (1636)
Distance traveled by a freely falling ball is proportional to the square of the
elapsed time
Sometime prior to 1638, Galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of
objects in free fall, attempting to characterize these motions. Galileo was not
the first to investigate Earth's gravitational field, nor was he the first to
accurately describe its fundamental characteristics. However, Galileo's
reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would
have a profound effect on future generations of scientists. It is unclear if
these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept, or if
they were real experiments performed by Galileo,[8] but the results obtained
from these experiments were both realistic and compelling. A biography by
Galileo's pupil Vincenzo_Viviani stated that Galileo had dropped balls of the
same material, but different masses, from the Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa to
demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.[note_5]
In support of this conclusion, Galileo had advanced the following theoretical
argument: He asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of
fall are tied by a string, does the combined system fall faster because it is
now more massive, or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the
heavier body? The only convincing resolution to this question is that all
bodies must fall at the same rate.[9]
A later experiment was described in Galileo's Two New Sciences published in
1638. One of Galileo's fictional characters, Salviati, describes an experiment
using a bronze ball and a wooden ramp. The wooden ramp was "12 cubits long,
half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick" with a straight, smooth,
polished groove. The groove was lined with "parchment, also smooth and polished
as possible". And into this groove was placed "a hard, smooth and very round
bronze ball". The ramp was inclined at various angles to slow the acceleration
enough so that the elapsed time could be measured. The ball was allowed to roll
a known distance down the ramp, and the time taken for the ball to move the
known distance was measured. The time was measured using a water clock
described as follows:
      "a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of
      this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of
      water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each
      descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its
      length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a
      very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave
      us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy
      that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no
      appreciable discrepancy in the results."[10]
Galileo found that for an object in free fall, the distance that the object has
fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time:
          Distance  &#x221D;    Time   2      {\displaystyle {\text
      {Distance}}\propto {{\text{Time}}^{2}}}  [{\text{Distance}}\propto {
      {\text{Time}}^{2}}]
Galileo had shown that objects in free fall under the influence of the Earth's
gravitational field have a constant acceleration, and Galileo's contemporary,
Johannes Kepler, had shown that the planets follow elliptical paths under the
influence of the Sun's gravitational mass. However, Galileo's free fall motions
and Kepler's planetary motions remained distinct during Galileo's lifetime.

Robert_Hooke had published his concept of gravitational forces in 1674, stating
that all celestial_bodies have an attraction or gravitating power towards their
own centers, and also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within
the sphere of their activity. He further stated that gravitational attraction
increases by how much nearer the body wrought upon is to their own center.[11]
In correspondence with Isaac_Newton from 1679 and 1680, Hooke conjectured that
gravitational forces might decrease according to the double of the distance
between the two bodies.[12] Hooke urged Newton, who was a pioneer in the
development of calculus, to work through the mathematical details of Keplerian
orbits to determine if Hooke's hypothesis was correct. Newton's own
investigations verified that Hooke was correct, but due to personal differences
between the two men, Newton chose not to reveal this to Hooke. Isaac Newton
kept quiet about his discoveries until 1684, at which time he told a friend,
Edmond_Halley, that he had solved the problem of gravitational orbits, but had
misplaced the solution in his office.[13] After being encouraged by Halley,
Newton decided to develop his ideas about gravity and publish all of his
findings. In November 1684, Isaac Newton sent a document to Edmund Halley, now
lost but presumed to have been titled De_motu_corporum_in_gyrum (Latin for "On
the motion of bodies in an orbit").[14] Halley presented Newton's findings to
the Royal_Society of London, with a promise that a fuller presentation would
follow. Newton later recorded his ideas in a three book set, entitled
PhilosophiÃ¦_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica (Latin: Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy). The first was received by the Royal Society on 28 April
1685â86; the second on 2 March 1686â87; and the third on 6 April 1686â87.
The Royal Society published Newton's entire collection at their own expense in
May 1686â87.[15]:31
Isaac Newton had bridged the gap between Kepler's gravitational mass and
Galileo's gravitational acceleration, resulting in the discovery of the
following relationship which governed both of these:
          g  = &#x2212; &#x03BC;      R  &#x005E;     |   R    |   2
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =-\mu {\frac {\hat {\mathbf {R} }}{|\mathbf
      {R} |^{2}}}}  [\mathbf {g} =-\mu {\frac {\hat {\mathbf {R} }}{|\mathbf
      {R} |^{2}}}]
where g is the apparent acceleration of a body as it passes through a region of
space where gravitational fields exist, Î¼ is the gravitational mass (standard
gravitational_parameter) of the body causing gravitational fields, and R is the
radial coordinate (the distance between the centers of the two bodies).
By finding the exact relationship between a body's gravitational mass and its
gravitational field, Newton provided a second method for measuring
gravitational mass. The mass of the Earth can be determined using Kepler's
method (from the orbit of Earth's Moon), or it can be determined by measuring
the gravitational acceleration on the Earth's surface, and multiplying that by
the square of the Earth's radius. The mass of the Earth is approximately three
millionths of the mass of the Sun. To date, no other accurate method for
measuring gravitational mass has been discovered.[16]
**** Newton's cannonball ****
A cannon on top of a very high mountain shoots a cannonball horizontally. If
the speed is low, the cannonball quickly falls back to Earth (A,B). At
intermediate_speeds, it will revolve around Earth along an elliptical orbit
(C,D). At a_sufficiently_high_speed, it will leave the Earth altogether (E).
Main article: Newton's_cannonball
Newton's cannonball was a thought_experiment used to bridge the gap between
Galileo's gravitational acceleration and Kepler's elliptical orbits. It
appeared in Newton's 1728 book A Treatise of the System of the World. According
to Galileo's concept of gravitation, a dropped stone falls with constant
acceleration down towards the Earth. However, Newton explains that when a stone
is thrown horizontally (meaning sideways or perpendicular to Earth's gravity)
it follows a curved path. "For a stone projected is by the pressure of its own
weight forced out of the rectilinear path, which by the projection alone it
should have pursued, and made to describe a curve line in the air; and through
that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground. And the greater the
velocity is with which it is projected, the farther it goes before it falls to
the Earth."[15]:513 Newton further reasons that if an object were "projected in
an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain" with sufficient
velocity, "it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the Earth,
and return to the mountain from which it was projected."[citation_needed]
**** Universal gravitational mass ****
An apple experiences gravitational fields directed towards every part of the
Earth; however, the sum total of these many fields produces a single
gravitational field directed towards the Earth's center
In contrast to earlier theories (e.g. celestial_spheres) which stated that the
heavens were made of entirely different material, Newton's theory of mass was
groundbreaking partly because it introduced universal_gravitational_mass: every
object has gravitational mass, and therefore, every object generates a
gravitational field. Newton further assumed that the strength of each object's
gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to
that object. If a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant
spherical body such as the Earth or Sun, Newton calculated the collection would
create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body,[15]:
397 and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body's
center.[15]:221[note_6]
For example, according to Newton's theory of universal gravitation, each carob
seed produces a gravitational field. Therefore, if one were to gather an
immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere, then the
gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob
seeds in the sphere. Hence, it should be theoretically possible to determine
the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a
gravitational field similar to that of the Earth or Sun. In fact, by unit
conversion it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional
mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass.

outside. Figure 1 of Cavendish's paper.
Measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in
principle, but extremely difficult in practice. According to Newton's theory
all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to
collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous
gravitating sphere. However, from a practical standpoint, the gravitational
fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure. Newton's
books on universal gravitation were published in the 1680s, but the first
successful measurement of the Earth's mass in terms of traditional mass units,
the Cavendish_experiment, did not occur until 1797, over a hundred years later.
Cavendish found that the Earth's density was 5.448 Â± 0.033 times that of
water. As of 2009, the Earth's mass in kilograms is only known to around five
digits of accuracy, whereas its gravitational mass is known to over nine
significant figures.[clarification_needed]
Given two objects A and B, of masses MA and MB, separated by a displacement
RAB, Newton's law of gravitation states that each object exerts a gravitational
force on the other, of magnitude
           F   AB   = &#x2212; G  M  A    M  B          R  &#x005E;     AB
      |    R   AB     |   2      &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\text
      {AB}}=-GM_{\text{A}}M_{\text{B}}{\frac {{\hat {\mathbf {R} }}_{\text
      {AB}}}{|\mathbf {R} _{\text{AB}}|^{2}}}\ }  [\mathbf {F} _{\text{AB}}=-
      GM_{\text{A}}M_{\text{B}}{\frac {{\hat {\mathbf {R} }}_{\text{AB}}}
      {|\mathbf {R} _{\text{AB}}|^{2}}}\ ],
where G is the universal gravitational_constant. The above statement may be
reformulated in the following way: if g is the magnitude at a given location in
a gravitational field, then the gravitational force on an object with
gravitational mass M is
         F = M g   {\displaystyle F=Mg}  [F=Mg].
This is the basis by which masses are determined by weighing. In simple spring
scales, for example, the force F is proportional to the displacement of the
spring beneath the weighing pan, as per Hooke's_law, and the scales are
calibrated to take g into account, allowing the mass M to be read off. Assuming
the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance, a balance
measures relative weight, giving the relative gravitation mass of each object.
**** Inertial mass ****
Massmeter, a device for measuring the inertial mass of an astronaut in
weightlessness. The mass is calculated via the oscillation period for a spring
with the astronaut attached (Tsiolkovsky_State_Museum_of_the_History_of
Cosmonautics)
Inertial mass is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to
acceleration. This definition has been championed by Ernst_Mach[17][18] and has
since been developed into the notion of operationalism by Percy_W._Bridgman.
[19][20] The simple classical_mechanics definition of mass is slightly
different than the definition in the theory of special_relativity, but the
essential meaning is the same.
In classical mechanics, according to Newton's_second_law, we say that a body
has a mass m if, at any instant of time, it obeys the equation of motion
          F  = m  a  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} ,}  [\mathbf
      {F} =m\mathbf {a} ,]
where F is the resultant force acting on the body and a is the acceleration of
the body's centre of mass.[note_7] For the moment, we will put aside the
question of what "force acting on the body" actually means.
This equation illustrates how mass relates to the inertia of a body. Consider
two objects with different masses. If we apply an identical force to each, the
object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration, and the
object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration. We might say
that the larger mass exerts a greater "resistance" to changing its state of
motion in response to the force.
However, this notion of applying "identical" forces to different objects brings
us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is. We can
sidestep this difficulty with the help of Newton's_third_law, which states that
if one object exerts a force on a second object, it will experience an equal
and opposite force. To be precise, suppose we have two objects of constant
inertial masses m1 and m2. We isolate the two objects from all other physical
influences, so that the only forces present are the force exerted on m1 by m2,
which we denote F12, and the force exerted on m2 by m1, which we denote F21.
Newton's second law states that
               F  12       =  m  1     a   1   ,       F  21       =  m  2
      a   2   ,       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {F_{12}} &=m_
      {1}\mathbf {a} _{1},\\\mathbf {F_{21}} &=m_{2}\mathbf {a} _{2},\end
      {aligned}}}  [{\begin{aligned}\mathbf {F_{12}} &=m_{1}\mathbf {a} _
      {1},\\\mathbf {F_{21}} &=m_{2}\mathbf {a} _{2},\end{aligned}}]
where a1 and a2 are the accelerations of m1 and m2, respectively. Suppose that
these accelerations are non-zero, so that the forces between the two objects
are non-zero. This occurs, for example, if the two objects are in the process
of colliding with one another. Newton's third law then states that
           F   12   = &#x2212;   F   21   ;   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _
      {12}=-\mathbf {F} _{21};}  [\mathbf {F} _{12}=-\mathbf {F} _{21};]
and thus
          m  1   =  m  2       |    a   2    |     |    a   1    |      .
      {\displaystyle m_{1}=m_{2}{\frac {|\mathbf {a} _{2}|}{|\mathbf {a} _
      {1}|}}\!.}  [m_{1}=m_{2}{\frac {|\mathbf {a} _{2}|}{|\mathbf {a} _
      {1}|}}\!.]
If |a1| is non-zero, the fraction is well-defined, which allows us to measure
the inertial mass of m1. In this case, m2 is our "reference" object, and we can
define its mass m as (say) 1 kilogram. Then we can measure the mass of any
other object in the universe by colliding it with the reference object and
measuring the accelerations.
Additionally, mass relates a body's momentum p to its linear velocity v:
          p  = m  v    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} }  [\mathbf {p}
      =m\mathbf {v} ],
and the body's kinetic_energy K to its velocity:
         K =    1 2    m  |   v    |   2     {\displaystyle K={\dfrac {1}
      {2}}m|\mathbf {v} |^{2}}  [K={\dfrac {1}{2}}m|\mathbf {v} |^{2}].
The primary difficulty with Mach's definition of mass is that it fails to take
into account the potential_energy (or binding_energy) needed to bring two
masses sufficiently close to one another to perform the measurement of mass.
[18] This is most vividly demonstrated by comparing the mass of the proton in
the nucleus of deuterium, to the mass of the proton in free space (which is
greater by about 0.239%âthis is due to the binding energy of deuterium.).
Thus, for example, if the reference weight m2 is taken to be the mass of the
neutron in free space, and the relative accelerations for the proton and
neutron in deuterium are computed, then the above formula over-estimates the
mass m1 (by 0.239%) for the proton in deuterium. At best, Mach's formula can
only be used to obtain ratios of masses, that is, as m1 /m2 = |a2| / |a1|. An
additional difficulty was pointed out by Henri_PoincarÃ©, which is that the
measurement of instantaneous acceleration is impossible: unlike the measurement
of time or distance, there is no way to measure acceleration with a single
measurement; one must make multiple measurements (of position, time, etc.) and
perform a computation to obtain the acceleration. PoincarÃ© termed this to be
an "insurmountable flaw" in the Mach definition of mass.[21]
***** Atomic mass *****
                        This article needs to be updated. Please update this
[Ambox current red.svg] section to reflect recent events or newly available
                        information. (June 2019)
Main article: Atomic_mass_unit
Typically, the mass of objects is measured in relation to that of the kilogram,
which is defined as the mass of the international_prototype_kilogram (IPK), a
platinum alloy cylinder stored in an environmentally-monitored safe secured in
a vault at the International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures in France. However,
the IPK is not convenient for measuring the masses of atoms and particles of
similar scale, as it contains trillions of trillions of atoms, and has most
certainly lost or gained a little mass over time despite the best efforts to
prevent this. It is much easier to precisely compare an atom's mass to that of
another atom, thus scientists developed the atomic_mass_unit (or Dalton). By
definition, 1 u is exactly one twelfth of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, and by
extension a carbon-12 atom has a mass of exactly 12 u. This definition,
however, might be changed by the proposed_redefinition_of_SI_base_units, which
will leave the Dalton very close to one, but no longer exactly equal to it.[22]
[23]
***** In relativity *****
**** Special relativity ****
Main article: Mass_in_special_relativity
In some frameworks of special_relativity, physicists have used differing
definitions of the term "mass". However, such usage is controversial and has
fallen out of favor.
In these frameworks, two kinds of mass are defined: rest_mass (invariant mass),
[note_8] and relativistic_mass (which increases with velocity). Rest mass is
the Newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object.
Relativistic mass is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided
by c2. The two are related by the following equation:
          m   r e l a t i v e    = &#x03B3; (  m   r e s t    )
      {\displaystyle m_{\mathrm {relative} }=\gamma (m_{\mathrm {rest} })\!}
      [m_{\mathrm {relative} }=\gamma (m_{\mathrm {rest} })\!]
where     &#x03B3;   {\displaystyle \gamma }  [\gamma ] is the Lorentz_factor:
         &#x03B3; =   1  1 &#x2212;  v  2    /   c  2        {\displaystyle
      \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}}  [\gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt
      {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}]
The invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames,
while the relativistic mass depends on the observer's frame_of_reference. In
order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values do not change
between observers, it is convenient to use rest mass. The rest mass of a body
is also related to its energy E and the magnitude of its momentum p by the
relativistic_energy-momentum_equation:
         (  m   r e s t    )  c  2   =    E   t o t a l    2   &#x2212; (  |
      p   |  c  )  2     .    {\displaystyle (m_{\mathrm {rest} })c^{2}={\sqrt
      {E_{\mathrm {total} }^{2}-(|\mathbf {p} |c)^{2}}}.\!}  [(m_{\mathrm
      {rest} })c^{2}={\sqrt {E_{\mathrm {total} }^{2}-(|\mathbf {p} |c)^
      {2}}}.\!]
So long as the system is closed with respect to mass and energy, both kinds of
mass are conserved in any given frame of reference. The conservation of mass
holds even as some types of particles are converted to others. Matter particles
(such as atoms) may be converted to non-matter particles (such as photons of
light), but this does not affect the total amount of mass or energy. Although
things like heat may not be matter, all types of energy still continue to
exhibit mass.[note_9][24] Thus, mass and energy do not change into one another
in relativity; rather, both are names for the same thing, and neither mass nor
energy appear without the other.
Both rest and relativistic mass can be expressed as an energy by applying the
well-known relationship E =_mc2, yielding rest_energy and "relativistic energy"
(total system energy) respectively:
          E   r e s t    = (  m   r e s t    )  c  2      {\displaystyle E_
      {\mathrm {rest} }=(m_{\mathrm {rest} })c^{2}\!}  [E_{\mathrm {rest} }=(m_
      {\mathrm {rest} })c^{2}\!]
          E   t o t a l    = (  m   r e l a t i v e    )  c  2
      {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {total} }=(m_{\mathrm {relative} })c^{2}\!}
      [E_{\mathrm {total} }=(m_{\mathrm {relative} })c^{2}\!]
The "relativistic" mass and energy concepts are related to their "rest"
counterparts, but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in
systems where there is a net momentum. Because the relativistic mass is
proportional_to_the_energy, it has gradually fallen into disuse among
physicists.[25] There is disagreement over whether the concept remains useful
pedagogically.[26][27][28]
In bound systems, the binding_energy must often be subtracted from the mass of
the unbound system, because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the
time it is bound. The mass of the system changes in this process merely because
the system was not closed during the binding process, so the energy escaped.
For example, the binding energy of atomic_nuclei is often lost in the form of
gamma rays when the nuclei are formed, leaving nuclides which have less mass
than the free particles (nucleons) of which they are composed.
Massâenergy_equivalence also holds in macroscopic systems.[29] For example,
if one takes exactly one kilogram of ice, and applies heat, the mass of the
resulting melt-water will be more than a kilogram: it will include the mass
from the thermal_energy (latent_heat) used to melt the ice; this follows from
the conservation_of_energy.[30] This number is small but not negligible: about
3.7 nanograms. It is given by the latent_heat of melting ice (334 kJ/kg)
divided by the speed of light squared (c2 = 9Ã1016 m2/s2).
**** General relativity ****
Main article: Mass_in_general_relativity
In general_relativity, the equivalence_principle is the equivalence of
gravitational and inertial_mass. At the core of this assertion is Albert
Einstein's idea that the gravitational force as experienced locally while
standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the pseudo-force
experienced by an observer in a non-inertial (i.e. accelerated) frame of
reference.
However, it turns out that it is impossible to find an objective general
definition for the concept of invariant_mass in general relativity. At the core
of the problem is the non-linearity of the Einstein_field_equations, making it
impossible to write the gravitational field energy as part of the
stressâenergy_tensor in a way that is invariant for all observers. For a
given observer, this can be achieved by the stressâenergyâmomentum
pseudotensor.[31]
***** In quantum physics *****
In classical_mechanics, the inert mass of a particle appears in the
EulerâLagrange_equation as a parameter m:
            d    d  t    &#xA0;  (      &#x2202; L   &#x2202;     x &#x02D9;
      i        )  &#xA0; = &#xA0; m      x &#x00A8;     i     {\displaystyle
      {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\ \left(\,{\frac {\partial L}
      {\partial {\dot {x}}_{i}}}\,\right)\ =\ m\,{\ddot {x}}_{i}}  [{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\ \left(\,{\frac {\partial L}{\partial
      {\dot {x}}_{i}}}\,\right)\ =\ m\,{\ddot {x}}_{i}].
After quantization, replacing the position vector x with a wave_function, the
parameter m appears in the kinetic_energy operator:
         i &#x210F;   &#x2202;  &#x2202; t    &#x03A8; (  r  ,  t ) =
      (  &#x2212;    &#x210F;  2    2 m     &#x2207;  2   + V (  r  )  )
      &#x03A8; (  r  ,  t )   {\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial
      t}}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,\,t)=\left(-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}+V
      (\mathbf {r} )\right)\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,\,t)}  [i\hbar {\frac {\partial }
      {\partial t}}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,\,t)=\left(-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}
      {2m}}\nabla ^{2}+V(\mathbf {r} )\right)\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,\,t)].
In the ostensibly covariant (relativistically invariant) Dirac_equation, and in
natural_units, this becomes:
         ( &#x2212; i  &#x03B3;  &#x03BC;    &#x2202;  &#x03BC;   + m )
      &#x03C8; = 0    {\displaystyle (-i\gamma ^{\mu }\partial _{\mu }+m)\psi
      =0\,}  [(-i\gamma ^{\mu }\partial _{\mu }+m)\psi =0\,]
where the "mass" parameter m is now simply a constant associated with the
quantum described by the wave function Ï.
In the Standard_Model of particle_physics as developed in the 1960s, this term
arises from the coupling of the field Ï to an additional field Î¦, the Higgs

**** Tachyonic particles and imaginary (complex) mass ****
Main articles: Tachyonic_field and Tachyon_Â§ Mass
A tachyonic_field, or simply tachyon, is a quantum_field with an imaginary
mass.[32] Although tachyons (particles that move faster_than_light) are a
purely hypothetical concept not generally believed to exist,[32][33] fields
with imaginary mass have come to play an important role in modern physics[34]
[34][35][36] and are discussed in popular books on physics.[32][37] Under no
circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such
theoriesâthe presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever
on the maximum velocity of signals (there is no violation of causality).[38]
While the field may have imaginary mass, any physical particles do not; the
"imaginary mass" shows that the system becomes unstable, and sheds the
instability by undergoing a type of phase_transition called tachyon
condensation (closely related to second order phase transitions) that results
in symmetry_breaking in current_models of particle_physics.
The term "tachyon" was coined by Gerald_Feinberg in a 1967 paper,[39] but it
was soon realized that Feinberg's model in fact did not allow for superluminal
speeds.[38] Instead, the imaginary mass creates an instability in the
configuration:- any configuration in which one or more field excitations are
tachyonic will spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no
physical tachyons. This process is known as tachyon condensation. Well known
examples include the condensation of the Higgs_boson in particle_physics, and
ferromagnetism in condensed_matter_physics.
Although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because
there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass, the mass is not
quantized. Rather, the scalar_field is; even for tachyonic quantum_fields, the
field_operators at spacelike separated points still commute_(or_anticommute),
thus preserving causality. Therefore, information still does not propagate
faster than light,[39] and solutions grow exponentially, but not superluminally
(there is no violation of causality). Tachyon_condensation drives a physical
system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce
physical tachyons, to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons
exist. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its
quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a
positive mass-squared.[40]
This is a special case of the general rule, where unstable massive particles
are formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part being their
mass in the usual sense, and the imaginary part being the decay_rate in natural
units.[40] However, in quantum_field_theory, a particle (a "one-particle
state") is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time; i.e., an
eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. An unstable_particle is a state which is only
approximately constant over time; If it exists long enough to be measured, it
can be formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part of the
mass greater than its imaginary part. If both parts are of the same magnitude,
this is interpreted as a resonance appearing in a scattering process rather
than a particle, as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured
independently of the scattering process. In the case of a tachyon the real part
of the mass is zero, and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to
it.
In a Lorentz_invariant theory, the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-
than-light particles (sometimes called "bradyons" in discussions of tachyons)
must also apply to tachyons. In particular the energyâmomentum_relation:
          E  2   =  p  2    c  2   +  m  2    c  4      {\displaystyle E^{2}=p^
      {2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}\;}  [E^{2}=p^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}\;]
(where p is the relativistic momentum of the bradyon and m is its rest_mass)
should still apply, along with the formula for the total energy of a particle:
         E =    m  c  2     1 &#x2212;    v  2    c  2        .
      {\displaystyle E={\frac {mc^{2}}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}.}
      [E={\frac {mc^{2}}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}.]
This equation shows that the total energy of a particle (bradyon or tachyon)
contains a contribution from its rest mass (the "rest massâenergy") and a
contribution from its motion, the kinetic energy. When v is larger than c, the
denominator in the equation for the energy is "imaginary", as the value under
the radical is negative. Because the total energy must be real, the numerator
must also be imaginary: i.e. the rest_mass m must be imaginary, as a pure
imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number.
**** Exotic matter and negative mass ****
Main article: negative_mass
The negative_mass exists in the model to describe dark_energy (phantom_energy)
and radiation in negative-index_metamaterial in a unified way.[41] In this way,
the negative mass is associated with negative_momentum, negative_pressure,
negative_kinetic_energy and FTL (faster-than-light).

***** Notes *****
   1. ^ When a distinction is necessary, M is used to denote the active
      gravitational mass and m the passive gravitational mass.
   2. ^ Since the Avogadro_constant NA is defined as the number of atoms in
      12 g of carbon-12, it follows that 1 u is exactly 1/(103NA) kg.
   3. ^ The distinction between "active" and "passive" gravitational mass does
      not exist in the Newtonian view of gravity as found in classical
      mechanics, and can safely be ignored for many purposes. In most practical
      applications, Newtonian gravity is assumed because it is usually
      sufficiently accurate, and is simpler than General Relativity; for
      example, NASA uses primarily Newtonian gravity to design space missions,
      although "accuracies are routinely enhanced by accounting for tiny
      relativistic effects".www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf3-2.php The distinction
      between "active" and "passive" is very abstract, and applies to post-
      graduate level applications of General Relativity to certain problems in
      cosmology, and is otherwise not used. There is, nevertheless, an
      important conceptual distinction in Newtonian physics between "inertial
      mass" and "gravitational mass", although these quantities are identical;
      the conceptual distinction between these two fundamental definitions of
      mass is maintained for teaching purposes because they involve two
      distinct methods of measurement. It was long considered anomalous that
      the two distinct measurements of mass (inertial and gravitational) gave
      an identical result. The property, observed by Galileo, that objects of
      different mass fall with the same rate of acceleration (ignoring air
      resistance), shows that inertial and gravitational mass are the same.
   4. ^ This constant ratio was later shown to be a direct measure of the Sun's
      active gravitational mass; it has units of distance cubed per time
      squared, and is known as the standard_gravitational_parameter:
               &#x03BC; = 4  &#x03C0;  2       distance   3     time   2
            &#x221D;  gravitational mass    {\displaystyle \mu =4\pi ^{2}{\frac
            {{\text{distance}}^{3}}{{\text{time}}^{2}}}\propto {\text
            {gravitational mass}}}  [\mu =4\pi ^{2}{\frac {{\text{distance}}^
            {3}}{{\text{time}}^{2}}}\propto {\text{gravitational mass}}]
   5. ^ At the time when Viviani asserts that the experiment took place,
      Galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall.
      He had, however, formulated an earlier version which predicted that
      bodies of the same material falling through the same medium would fall at
      the same speed. SeeDrake, S. (1978). Galileo_at_Work. University of
      Chicago Press. pp. 19â20. ISBN 978-0-226-16226-3.

   7. ^ These two properties are very useful, as they allow spherical
      collections of objects to be treated exactly like large individual
      objects.
   8. ^ In its original form, Newton's second law is valid only for bodies of
      constant mass.
   9. ^ It is possible to make a slight distinction between "rest mass" and
      "invariant mass". For a system of two or more particles, none of the
      particles are required be at rest with respect to the observer for the
      system as a whole to be at rest with respect to the observer. To avoid
      this confusion, some sources will use "rest mass" only for individual
      particles, and "invariant mass" for systems.
  10. ^ For example, a nuclear bomb in an idealized super-strong box, sitting
      on a scale, would in theory show no change in mass when detonated
      (although the inside of the box would become much hotter). In such a
      system, the mass of the box would change only if energy were allowed to
      escape from the box as light or heat. However, in that case, the removed
      energy would take its associated mass with it. Letting heat or radiation
      out of such a system is simply a way to remove mass. Thus, mass, like
      energy, cannot be destroyed, but only moved from one place to another.
