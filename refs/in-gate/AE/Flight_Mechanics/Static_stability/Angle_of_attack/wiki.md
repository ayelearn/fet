Platform angle of attack
Angle of attack of an airfoil
In fluid_dynamics, angle of attack (AOA, Î±, or    &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle
\alpha }  [\alpha ]) is the angle between a reference_line on a body (often the
chord_line of an airfoil) and the vector representing the relative motion
between the body and the fluid through which it is moving.[1] Angle of attack
is the angle between the body's reference line and the oncoming flow. This
article focuses on the most common application, the angle of attack of a wing
or airfoil moving through air.
In aerodynamics, angle of attack specifies the angle between the chord line of
the wing of a fixed-wing_aircraft and the vector representing the relative
motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a
chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference
line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of the root_of_the_wing is chosen
as the reference line. Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the
fuselage as the reference line (and also as the longitudinal axis).[2] Some
authors[3][4] do not use an arbitrary chord line but use the zero_lift_axis
where, by definition, zero angle of attack corresponds to zero coefficient_of
lift.
Some British authors have used the term angle_of_incidence instead of angle of
attack.[5] However, this can lead to confusion with the term riggers' angle of
incidence meaning the angle between the chord of an airfoil and some fixed
datum in the airplane.[6]
Erroneous or otherwise faulty AOA readings can have far reaching consequences.
Inaccurate data from such sensors being fed to a software maneuvering
characteristics augmentation scheme have been implicated somewhat in the Boeing
737_Max incidents in 2018-2019.

***** Relation between angle of attack and lift[edit] *****
A typical lift_coefficient curve.
The lift_coefficient of a fixed-wing_aircraft varies with angle of attack.
Increasing angle of attack is associated with increasing lift coefficient up to
the maximum lift coefficient, after which lift coefficient decreases.[7]
As the angle of attack of a fixed-wing aircraft increases, separation of the
airflow from the upper surface of the wing becomes more pronounced, leading to
a reduction in the rate of increase of the lift coefficient. The figure shows a
typical curve for a cambered straight wing. Cambered airfoils are curved such
that they generate some lift at small negative angles of attack. A symmetrical
wing has zero lift at 0 degrees angle of attack. The lift curve is also
influenced by the wing shape, including its airfoil section and wing_planform.
A swept_wing has a lower, flatter curve with a higher critical angle.
***** Critical angle of attack[edit] *****
The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack which produces maximum lift
coefficient. This is also called the "stall angle of attack". Below the
critical angle of attack, as the angle of attack decreases, the lift
coefficient decreases. Conversely, above the critical angle of attack, as angle
of attack increases, the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper
surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface. On most
airfoil shapes, as the angle of attack increases, the upper surface separation
point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge. At the
critical angle of attack, upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil
or wing is producing its maximum lift coefficient. As angle of attack increases
further, the upper surface flow becomes more fully separated and the lift
coefficient reduces further.[7]
Above this critical angle of attack, the aircraft is said to be in a stall. A
fixed-wing aircraft by definition is stalled at or above the critical angle of
attack rather than at or below a particular airspeed. The airspeed at which the
aircraft stalls varies with the weight of the aircraft, the load_factor, the
center of gravity of the aircraft and other factors. However the aircraft
always stalls at the same critical angle of attack. The critical or stalling
angle of attack is typically around 15Â° - 20Â° for many airfoils.
Some aircraft are equipped with a built-in flight computer that automatically
prevents the aircraft from increasing the angle of attack any further when a
maximum angle of attack is reached, regardless of pilot input. This is called
the 'angle of attack limiter' or 'alpha limiter'. Modern airliners that have
fly-by-wire technology avoid the critical angle of attack by means of software
in the computer systems that govern the flight control surfaces.
In takeoff and landing operations from short runways, such as Naval Aircraft
Carrier operations and STOL back country flying, aircraft may be equipped with
angle of attack or Lift_Reserve_Indicators. These indicators measure the angle
of attack (AOA) or the Potential of Wing Lift (POWL, or Lift Reserve) directly
and help the pilot fly close to the stalling point with greater precision. STOL
operations require the aircraft to be able to operate close to the critical
angle of attack during landings and at the best angle of climb during takeoffs.
Angle of attack indicators are used by pilots for maximum performance during
these maneuvers since airspeed information is only indirectly related to stall
behaviour.
***** Very high alpha[edit] *****

Some military aircraft are able to achieve controlled flight at very high
angles of attack, but at the cost of massive induced_drag. This provides the
aircraft with great agility. A famous military example is sometimes thought to
be Pugachev's_Cobra. Although the aircraft experiences high angles of attack
throughout the maneuver, the aircraft is not capable of either aerodynamic
directional control or maintaining level flight until the maneuver ends. The
Cobra is an example of supermaneuvering[8][9] as the aircraft's wings are well
beyond the critical angle of attack for most of the maneuver.
Additional aerodynamic surfaces known as "high-lift devices" including leading
edge_wing_root_extensions allow fighter_aircraft much greater flyable 'true'
alpha, up to over 45Â°, compared to about 20Â° for aircraft without these
devices. This can be helpful at high altitudes where even slight maneuvering
may require high angles of attack due to the low density of air in the upper
atmosphere as well as at low speed at low altitude where the margin between
level flight AoA and stall AoA is reduced. The high AoA capability of the
aircraft provides a buffer for the pilot that makes stalling the airplane
(which occurs when critical AoA is exceeded) more difficult. However, military
aircraft usually do not obtain such high alpha in combat, as it robs the
aircraft of speed very quickly due to induced drag, and in extreme cases,
increased frontal area and parasitic drag. Not only do such maneuvers slow the
aircraft down, but they cause significant structural stress at high speed.
Modern flight control systems tend to limit a fighter's angle of attack to well
below its maximum aerodynamic limit.[citation_needed]
***** Sailing[edit] *****
In sailing, the physical principles involved are the same as for aircraft.[10]
A sail's angle of attack is the angle between the sail's chord line and the
direction of the relative wind.
