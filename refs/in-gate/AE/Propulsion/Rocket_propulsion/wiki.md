Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and
artificial satellites. Space propulsion or in-space propulsion exclusively
deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should not be
confused with launch_vehicles. Several methods, both pragmatic and
hypothetical, have been developed each having its own drawbacks and advantages.
Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant
rockets) or resistojet_rockets for orbital_station-keeping and some use
momentum_wheels for attitude_control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric
propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting
to use them for north-south station-keeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary
vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used Ion
thrusters and Hall_effect_thrusters (two different types of electric
propulsion) to great success.

***** Requirements[edit] *****
Further information: Escape_velocity
Artificial satellites are first launched into the desired altitude by
conventional liquid/solid propelled rockets after which the satellite may use
onboard propulsion systems for orbital stationkeeping. Once in the desired
orbit, they often need some form of attitude_control so that they are correctly
pointed with respect to the Earth, the Sun, and possibly some astronomical
object of interest.[1] They are also subject to drag from the thin atmosphere,
so that to stay in orbit for a long period of time some form of propulsion is
occasionally necessary to make small corrections (orbital_station-keeping).[2]
Many satellites need to be moved from one orbit to another from time to time,
and this also requires propulsion.[3] A satellite's useful life is usually over
once it has exhausted its ability to adjust its orbit.
For interplanetary_travel, a spacecraft can use its engines to leave Earth's
orbit. It is not explicitly necessary as the initial boost given by the rocket,
gravity slingshot, monopropellant/bipropellent attitude control propulsion
system are enough for the exploration of the solar system (see New_Horizons).
Once it has done so, it must somehow make its way to its destination. Current
interplanetary spacecraft do this with a series of short-term trajectory
adjustments.[4] In between these adjustments, the spacecraft simply moves along
its trajectory with a constant velocity. The most fuel-efficient means to move
from one circular orbit to another is with a Hohmann_transfer_orbit: the
spacecraft begins in a roughly circular orbit around the Sun. A short period of
thrust in the direction of motion accelerates or decelerates the spacecraft
into an elliptical orbit around the Sun which is tangential to its previous
orbit and also to the orbit of its destination. The spacecraft falls freely
along this elliptical orbit until it reaches its destination, where another
short period of thrust accelerates or decelerates it to match the orbit of its
destination.[5] Special methods such as aerobraking or aerocapture are
sometimes used for this final orbital adjustment.[6]
Artist's concept of a solar sail
Some spacecraft propulsion methods such as solar_sails provide very low but
inexhaustible thrust;[7] an interplanetary vehicle using one of these methods
would follow a rather different trajectory, either constantly thrusting against
its direction of motion in order to decrease its distance from the Sun or
constantly thrusting along its direction of motion to increase its distance
from the Sun. The concept has been successfully tested by the Japanese IKAROS
solar sail spacecraft.
No spacecraft capable of short duration (compared to human lifetime)
interstellar_travel has yet been built, but many hypothetical designs have been
discussed. Because interstellar distances are very great, a tremendous velocity
is needed to get a spacecraft to its destination in a reasonable amount of
time. Acquiring such a velocity on launch and getting rid of it on arrival
remains a formidable challenge for spacecraft designers.[8]
***** Effectiveness[edit] *****
When in space, the purpose of a propulsion_system is to change the velocity, or
v, of a spacecraft. Because this is more difficult for more massive
spacecrafts, designers generally discuss spacecraft performance in amount of
change in momentum per unit of propellant consumed also called specific
impulse.[9] Higher the specific impulse, better the efficiency. Ion propulsion
engines have high specific impulse (~3000 s) and low thrust[10] whereas
chemical rockets like monopropellant or bipropellant rocket engines have a low
specific impulse (~300 s) but high thrust[11].
When launching a spacecraft from Earth, a propulsion method must overcome a
higher gravitational pull to provide a positive net acceleration.[12] In orbit,
any additional impulse, even very tiny, will result in a change in the orbit
path.
1) Prograde/Retrogade (i.e. acceleration in the tangential/opposite in
tangential direction) - Increases/Decreases altitude of orbit
2) Perpendicular to orbital plane - Changes Orbital_inclination
The rate of change of velocity is called acceleration, and the rate of change
of momentum is called force. To reach a given velocity, one can apply a small
acceleration over a long period of time, or one can apply a large acceleration
over a short time. Similarly, one can achieve a given impulse with a large
force over a short time or a small force over a long time. This means that for
manoeuvring in space, a propulsion method that produces tiny accelerations but
runs for a long time can produce the same impulse as a propulsion method that
produces large accelerations for a short time. When launching from a planet,
tiny accelerations cannot overcome the planet's gravitational pull and so
cannot be used.
Earth's surface is situated fairly deep in a gravity_well. The escape_velocity
required to get out of it is 11.2 kilometers/second. As human beings evolved in
a gravitational field of 1g (9.8 m/sÂ²), an ideal propulsion system would be
one that provides a continuous acceleration of 1g (though human bodies can
tolerate much larger accelerations over short periods). The occupants of a
rocket or spaceship having such a propulsion system would be free from all the
ill effects of free_fall, such as nausea, muscular weakness, reduced sense of
taste, or leaching of calcium from their bones.
The law of conservation_of_momentum means that in order for a propulsion method
to change the momentum of a space craft it must change the momentum of
something else as well. A few designs take advantage of things like magnetic
fields or light pressure in order to change the spacecraft's momentum, but in
free space the rocket must bring along some mass to accelerate away in order to
push itself forward. Such mass is called reaction_mass.
In order for a rocket to work, it needs two things: reaction mass and energy.
The impulse provided by launching a particle of reaction mass having mass m at
velocity v is mv. But this particle has kinetic energy mvÂ²/2, which must come
from somewhere. In a conventional solid, liquid, or hybrid_rocket, the fuel is
burned, providing the energy, and the reaction products are allowed to flow out
the back, providing the reaction mass. In an ion_thruster, electricity is used
to accelerate ions out the back. Here some other source must provide the
electrical energy (perhaps a solar_panel or a nuclear_reactor), whereas the
ions provide the reaction mass.[12]
When discussing the efficiency of a propulsion system, designers often focus on
effectively using the reaction mass. Reaction mass must be carried along with
the rocket and is irretrievably consumed when used. One way of measuring the
amount of impulse that can be obtained from a fixed amount of reaction mass is
the specific_impulse, the impulse per unit weight-on-Earth (typically
designated by      I  sp     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}]).
The unit for this value is seconds. Because the weight on Earth of the reaction
mass is often unimportant when discussing vehicles in space, specific impulse
can also be discussed in terms of impulse per unit mass. This alternate form of
specific impulse uses the same units as velocity (e.g. m/s), and in fact it is
equal to the effective exhaust velocity of the engine (typically designated
v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}  [v_{e}]). Confusingly, both values are
sometimes called specific impulse. The two values differ by a factor of gn, the
standard acceleration due to gravity 9.80665 m/sÂ² (     I  sp    g   n    =  v
e     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}g_{\mathrm {n} }=v_{e}}  [{\displaystyle I_
{\text{sp}}g_{\mathrm {n} }=v_{e}}]).
A rocket with a high exhaust velocity can achieve the same impulse with less
reaction mass. However, the energy required for that impulse is proportional to
the exhaust velocity, so that more mass-efficient engines require much more
energy, and are typically less energy efficient. This is a problem if the
engine is to provide a large amount of thrust. To generate a large amount of
impulse per second, it must use a large amount of energy per second. So high-
mass-efficient engines require enormous amounts of energy per second to produce
high thrusts. As a result, most high-mass-efficient engine designs also provide
lower thrust due to the unavailability of high amounts of energy.
***** Methods[edit] *****
Propulsion methods can be classified based on their means of accelerating the
reaction mass. There are also some special methods for launches, planetary
arrivals, and landings.
**** Reaction engines[edit] ****
Main article: Reaction_engine
A reaction engine is an engine which provides propulsion by expelling reaction
mass, in accordance with Newton's_third_law_of_motion. This law of motion is
most commonly paraphrased as: "For every action there is an equal, and
opposite, reaction".
Examples include both duct_engines and rocket_engines, and more uncommon
variations such as Hall_effect_thrusters, ion_drives and mass_drivers. Duct
engines are obviously not used for space propulsion due to the lack of air;
however some proposed spacecraft have these kinds of engines to assist takeoff
and landing.
*** Delta-v and propellant[edit] ***
Rocket mass_ratios versus final velocity, as calculated from the rocket
equation
Exhausting the entire usable propellant of a spacecraft through the engines in
a straight line in free space would produce a net velocity change to the
vehicle; this number is termed delta-v (    &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta
v}  [\Delta v]).
If the exhaust velocity is constant then the total     &#x0394; v
{\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] of a vehicle can be calculated using the
rocket equation, where M is the mass of propellant, P is the mass of the
payload (including the rocket structure), and      v  e     {\displaystyle v_
{e}}  [v_{e}] is the velocity_of_the_rocket_exhaust. This is known as the
Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation:
         &#x0394; v =  v  e   ln &#x2061;  (    M + P  P   )  .
      {\displaystyle \Delta v=v_{e}\ln \left({\frac {M+P}{P}}\right).}
      [ \Delta v = v_e \ln \left(\frac{M+P}{P}\right). ]
For historical reasons, as discussed above,      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}
[v_{e}] is sometimes written as
          v  e   =  I  sp    g  0     {\displaystyle v_{e}=I_{\text{sp}}g_{0}}
      [{\displaystyle v_{e}=I_{\text{sp}}g_{0}}]
where      I  sp     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}] is the
specific_impulse of the rocket, measured in seconds, and      g  0
{\displaystyle g_{0}}  [g_{0}] is the gravitational_acceleration at sea level.
For a high delta-v mission, the majority of the spacecraft's mass needs to be
reaction mass. Because a rocket must carry all of its reaction mass, most of
the initially-expended reaction mass goes towards accelerating reaction mass
rather than payload. If the rocket has a payload of mass P, the spacecraft
needs to change its velocity by     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}
[\Delta v], and the rocket engine has exhaust velocity ve, then the reaction
mass M which is needed can be calculated using the rocket equation and the
formula for      I  sp     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}]:
         M = P  (   e    &#x0394; v   v  e      &#x2212; 1  )  .
      {\displaystyle M=P\left(e^{\frac {\Delta v}{v_{e}}}-1\right).}  [
      {\displaystyle M=P\left(e^{\frac {\Delta v}{v_{e}}}-1\right).}]
For     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] much smaller than ve,
this equation is roughly linear, and little reaction mass is needed. If
&#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] is comparable to ve, then
there needs to be about twice as much fuel as combined payload and structure
(which includes engines, fuel tanks, and so on). Beyond this, the growth is
exponential; speeds much higher than the exhaust velocity require very high
ratios of fuel mass to payload and structural mass.
For a mission, for example, when launching from or landing on a planet, the
effects of gravitational attraction and any atmospheric drag must be overcome
by using fuel. It is typical to combine the effects of these and other effects
into an effective mission delta-v. For example, a launch mission to low Earth
orbit requires about 9.3â10 km/s delta-v. These mission delta-vs are
typically numerically integrated on a computer.
Some effects such as Oberth_effect can only be significantly utilised by high
thrust engines such as rockets; i.e., engines that can produce a high g-force
(thrust per unit mass, equal to delta-v per unit time).
*** Power use and propulsive efficiency[edit] ***
For all reaction_engines (such as rockets and ion drives) some energy must go
into accelerating the reaction mass. Every engine will waste some energy, but
even assuming 100% efficiency, to accelerate an exhaust the engine will need
energy amounting to
           1 2      m &#x02D9;     v  e   2     {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}
      {\dot {m}}v_{e}^{2}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}{\dot {m}}v_{e}^{2}}]
      [13]
This energy is not necessarily lost- some of it usually ends up as kinetic
energy of the vehicle, and the rest is wasted in residual motion of the
exhaust.
Due to energy carried away in the exhaust, the energy efficiency of a reaction
engine varies with the speed of the exhaust relative to the speed of the
vehicle, this is called propulsive_efficiency
Comparing the rocket equation (which shows how much energy ends up in the final
vehicle) and the above equation (which shows the total energy required) shows
that even with 100% engine efficiency, certainly not all energy supplied ends
up in the vehicle - some of it, indeed usually most of it, ends up as kinetic
energy of the exhaust.
The exact amount depends on the design of the vehicle, and the mission.
However, there are some useful fixed points:
    * if the      I  sp     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}] is
      fixed, for a mission delta-v, there is a particular      I  sp
      {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}] that minimises the overall
      energy used by the rocket. This comes to an exhaust velocity of about â
      of the mission delta-v (see the_energy_computed_from_the_rocket
      equation). Drives with a specific impulse that is both high and fixed
      such as Ion thrusters have exhaust velocities that can be enormously
      higher than this ideal for many missions.
    * if the exhaust velocity can be made to vary so that at each instant it is
      equal and opposite to the vehicle velocity then the absolute minimum
      energy usage is achieved. When this is achieved, the exhaust stops in
      space [1] and has no kinetic energy; and the propulsive efficiency is
      100%- all the energy ends up in the vehicle (in principle such a drive
      would be 100% efficient, in practice there would be thermal losses from
      within the drive system and residual heat in the exhaust). However, in
      most cases this uses an impractical quantity of propellant, but is a
      useful theoretical consideration. Anyway, the vehicle has to move before
      the method can be applied.
Some drives (such as VASIMR or electrodeless_plasma_thruster) actually can
significantly vary their exhaust velocity. This can help reduce propellant
usage or improve acceleration at different stages of the flight. However the
best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the exhaust
velocity is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually
have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of
VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15000 m/s compared to a mission delta-
v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about 4000 m/s).
It might be thought that adding power generation capacity is helpful, and
although initially this can improve performance, this inevitably increases the
weight of the power source, and eventually the mass of the power source and the
associated engines and propellant dominates the weight of the vehicle, and then
adding more power gives no significant improvement.
For, although solar_power and nuclear power are virtually unlimited sources of
energy, the maximum power they can supply is substantially proportional to the
mass of the powerplant (i.e. specific_power takes a largely constant value
which is dependent on the particular powerplant technology). For any given
specific power, with a large      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}  [v_{e}] which
is desirable to save propellant mass, it turns out that the maximum
acceleration is inversely proportional to      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}
[v_{e}]. Hence the time to reach a required delta-v is proportional to      v
e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}  [v_{e}]. Thus the latter should not be too large.
*** Energy[edit] ***
Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a
vehicle accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency
In the ideal case      m  1     {\displaystyle m_{1}}  [m_{1}] is useful
payload and      m  0   &#x2212;  m  1     {\displaystyle m_{0}-m_{1}}  [m_0-
m_1] is reaction mass (this corresponds to empty tanks having no mass, etc.).
The energy required can simply be computed as
           1 2   (  m  0   &#x2212;  m  1   )  v  e   2     {\displaystyle
      {\frac {1}{2}}(m_{0}-m_{1})v_{\text{e}}^{2}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1}
      {2}}(m_{0}-m_{1})v_{\text{e}}^{2}}]
This corresponds to the kinetic energy the expelled reaction mass would have at
a speed equal to the exhaust speed. If the reaction mass had to be accelerated
from zero speed to the exhaust speed, all energy produced would go into the
reaction mass and nothing would be left for kinetic energy gain by the rocket
and payload. However, if the rocket already moves and accelerates (the reaction
mass is expelled in the direction opposite to the direction in which the rocket
moves) less kinetic energy is added to the reaction mass. To see this, if, for
example,      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}  [v_{e}]=10 km/s and the speed of
the rocket is 3 km/s, then the speed of a small amount of expended reaction
mass changes from 3 km/s forwards to 7 km/s rearwards. Thus, although the
energy required is 50 MJ per kg reaction mass, only 20 MJ is used for the
increase in speed of the reaction mass. The remaining 30 MJ is the increase of
the kinetic energy of the rocket and payload.
In general:
         d  (    1 2    v  2    )  = v d v = v  v  e      d m  m   =   1 2
      [   v  e   2   &#x2212;   (  v &#x2212;  v  e    )   2   +  v  2    ]
      d m  m     {\displaystyle d\left({\frac {1}{2}}v^{2}\right)=vdv=vv_{\text
      {e}}{\frac {dm}{m}}={\frac {1}{2}}\left[v_{\text{e}}^{2}-\left(v-v_{\text
      {e}}\right)^{2}+v^{2}\right]{\frac {dm}{m}}}  [{\displaystyle d\left(
      {\frac {1}{2}}v^{2}\right)=vdv=vv_{\text{e}}{\frac {dm}{m}}={\frac {1}
      {2}}\left[v_{\text{e}}^{2}-\left(v-v_{\text{e}}\right)^{2}+v^{2}\right]
      {\frac {dm}{m}}}]
Thus the specific energy gain of the rocket in any small time interval is the
energy gain of the rocket including the remaining fuel, divided by its mass,
where the energy gain is equal to the energy produced by the fuel minus the
energy gain of the reaction mass. The larger the speed of the rocket, the
smaller the energy gain of the reaction mass; if the rocket speed is more than
half of the exhaust speed the reaction mass even loses energy on being
expelled, to the benefit of the energy gain of the rocket; the larger the speed
of the rocket, the larger the energy loss of the reaction mass.
We have
         &#x0394; &#x03F5; = &#x222B; v  d ( &#x0394; v )   {\displaystyle
      \Delta \epsilon =\int v\,d(\Delta v)}  [\Delta \epsilon =  \int v\, d
      (\Delta v)]
where     &#x03F5;   {\displaystyle \epsilon }  [\epsilon ] is the specific
energy of the rocket (potential plus kinetic energy) and     &#x0394; v
{\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] is a separate variable, not just the
change in     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v]. In the case of using the rocket for
deceleration; i.e., expelling reaction mass in the direction of the velocity,
v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] should be taken negative.
The formula is for the ideal case again, with no energy lost on heat, etc. The
latter causes a reduction of thrust, so it is a disadvantage even when the
objective is to lose energy (deceleration).
If the energy is produced by the mass itself, as in a chemical rocket, the fuel
value has to be        v  e   2    /  2     {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {v_
{\text{e}}^{2}/2}}  [\scriptstyle{v_\text{e}^2/2}], where for the fuel value
also the mass of the oxidizer has to be taken into account. A typical value is
v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_{\text{e}}] = 4.5 km/s, corresponding
to a fuel value of 10.1 MJ/kg. The actual fuel value is higher, but much of the
energy is lost as waste heat in the exhaust that the nozzle was unable to
extract.
The required energy     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] is
         E =   1 2    m  1    (   e    &#x0394; v   v  e      &#x2212; 1  )   v
      e   2     {\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}m_{1}\left(e^{\frac {\Delta v}
      {v_{\text{e}}}}-1\right)v_{\text{e}}^{2}}  [{\displaystyle E={\frac {1}
      {2}}m_{1}\left(e^{\frac {\Delta v}{v_{\text{e}}}}-1\right)v_{\text{e}}^
      {2}}]
Conclusions:
    * for     &#x0394; v &#x226A;  v  e     {\displaystyle \Delta v\ll v_{e}}
      [\Delta v \ll v_e] we have     E &#x2248;   1 2    m  1    v  e
      &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle E\approx {\frac {1}{2}}m_{1}v_{\text
      {e}}\Delta v}  [{\displaystyle E\approx {\frac {1}{2}}m_{1}v_{\text
      {e}}\Delta v}]
    * for a given     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v], the
      minimum energy is needed if      v  e   = 0.6275 &#x0394; v
      {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}=0.6275\Delta v}  [{\displaystyle v_{\text
      {e}}=0.6275\Delta v}], requiring an energy of
         E = 0.772  m  1   ( &#x0394; v  )  2     {\displaystyle E=0.772m_{1}
      (\Delta v)^{2}}  [E = 0.772 m_1(\Delta v)^2].
      In the case of acceleration in a fixed direction, and starting from zero
      speed, and in the absence of other forces, this is 54.4% more than just
      the final kinetic energy of the payload. In this optimal case the initial
      mass is 4.92 times the final mass.
These results apply for a fixed exhaust speed.
Due to the Oberth_effect and starting from a nonzero speed, the required
potential energy needed from the propellant may be less than the increase in
energy in the vehicle and payload. This can be the case when the reaction mass
has a lower speed after being expelled than before â rockets are able to
liberate some or all of the initial kinetic energy of the propellant.
Also, for a given objective such as moving from one orbit to another, the
required     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] may depend
greatly on the rate at which the engine can produce     &#x0394; v
{\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] and maneuvers may even be impossible if
that rate is too low. For example, a launch to Low_Earth_orbit (LEO) normally
requires a     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] of ca. 9.5 km/
s (mostly for the speed to be acquired), but if the engine could produce
&#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] at a rate of only slightly
more than g, it would be a slow launch requiring altogether a very large
&#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] (think of hovering without
making any progress in speed or altitude, it would cost a     &#x0394; v
{\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] of 9.8 m/s each second). If the possible
rate is only     g   {\displaystyle g}  [g] or less, the maneuver can not be
carried out at all with this engine.

where     F   {\displaystyle F}  [F] is the thrust and     a   {\displaystyle
a}  [a] the acceleration due to it. Thus the theoretically possible thrust per
unit power is 2 divided by the specific impulse in m/s. The thrust efficiency
is the actual thrust as percentage of this.
If, e.g., solar_power is used, this restricts     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a];
in the case of a large      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_{\text
{e}}] the possible acceleration is inversely proportional to it, hence the time
to reach a required delta-v is proportional to      v  e     {\displaystyle v_
{\text{e}}}  [v_{\text{e}}]; with 100% efficiency:
    * for     &#x0394; v &#x226A;  v  e     {\displaystyle \Delta v\ll v_{\text
      {e}}}  [\Delta v \ll v_\text{e}] we have     t &#x2248;    m  v  e
      &#x0394; v   2 P      {\displaystyle t\approx {\frac {mv_{\text{e}}\Delta
      v}{2P}}}  [{\displaystyle t\approx {\frac {mv_{\text{e}}\Delta v}{2P}}}]
Examples:
    * power, 1000 W; mass, 100 kg;     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}
      [\Delta v] = 5 km/s,      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_
      {\text{e}}] = 16 km/s, takes 1.5 months.
    * power, 1000 W; mass, 100 kg;     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}
      [\Delta v] = 5 km/s,      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_
      {\text{e}}] = 50 km/s, takes 5 months.
Thus      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_{\text{e}}] should not be
too large.
*** Power to thrust ratio[edit] ***
The power to thrust ratio is simply:[13]
           P F   =      1 2       m &#x02D9;     v  2         m &#x02D9;    v
      =   1 2   v   {\displaystyle {\frac {P}{F}}={\frac {{\frac {1}{2}}{{\dot
      {m}}v^{2}}}{{\dot {m}}v}}={\frac {1}{2}}v}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {P}
      {F}}={\frac {{\frac {1}{2}}{{\dot {m}}v^{2}}}{{\dot {m}}v}}={\frac {1}
      {2}}v}]
Thus for any vehicle power P, the thrust that may be provided is:
         F =   P    1 2   v    =    2 P  v     {\displaystyle F={\frac {P}{
      {\frac {1}{2}}v}}={\frac {2P}{v}}}  [{\displaystyle F={\frac {P}{{\frac
      {1}{2}}v}}={\frac {2P}{v}}}]

   2. ^ Assumes a specific power of 1 kW/kg
Observe that the more fuel-efficient engines can use far less fuel; their mass
is almost negligible (relative to the mass of the payload and the engine
itself) for some of the engines. However, note also that these require a large
total amount of energy. For Earth launch, engines require a thrust to weight
ratio of more than one. To do this with the ion or more theoretical electrical
drives, the engine would have to be supplied with one to several gigawatts of
power, equivalent to a major metropolitan generating_station. From the table it
can be seen that this is clearly impractical with current power sources.
Alternative approaches include some forms of laser_propulsion, where the
reaction_mass does not provide the energy required to accelerate it, with the
energy instead being provided from an external laser or other beam-powered
propulsion system. Small models of some of these concepts have flown, although
the engineering problems are complex and the ground-based power systems are not
a solved problem.
Instead, a much smaller, less powerful generator may be included which will
take much longer to generate the total energy needed. This lower power is only
sufficient to accelerate a tiny amount of fuel per second, and would be
insufficient for launching from Earth. However, over long periods in orbit
where there is no friction, the velocity will be finally achieved. For example,
it took the SMART-1 more than a year to reach the Moon, whereas with a chemical
rocket it takes a few days. Because the ion drive needs much less fuel, the
total launched mass is usually lower, which typically results in a lower
overall cost, but the journey takes longer.
Mission planning therefore frequently involves adjusting and choosing the
propulsion system so as to minimise the total cost of the project, and can
involve trading off launch costs and mission duration against payload fraction.
*** Rocket engines[edit] ***
Main article: Rocket_engine
SpaceX's Kestrel_engine is tested
Most rocket engines are internal_combustion heat_engines (although non
combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature
reaction mass, as a hot gas. This is achieved by combusting a solid, liquid or
gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot
gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This bell-
shaped nozzle is what gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The
effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of
the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10
times the speed of sound at sea level are common.
Rocket engines provide essentially the highest specific powers and high
specific thrusts of any engine used for spacecraft propulsion.
Ion propulsion rockets can heat a plasma or charged gas inside a magnetic
bottle and release it via a magnetic_nozzle, so that no solid matter need come
in contact with the plasma. Of course, the machinery to do this is complex, but
research into nuclear_fusion has developed methods, some of which have been
proposed to be used in propulsion systems, and some have been tested in a lab.
See rocket_engine for a listing of various kinds of rocket engines using
different heating methods, including chemical, electrical, solar, and nuclear.
*** Electromagnetic propulsion[edit] ***
This test engine accelerates ions using electrostatic forces
Main article: Electrically_powered_spacecraft_propulsion
Rather than relying on high temperature and fluid_dynamics to accelerate the
reaction mass to high speeds, there are a variety of methods that use
electrostatic or electromagnetic forces to accelerate the reaction mass
directly. Usually the reaction mass is a stream of ions. Such an engine
typically uses electric power, first to ionize atoms, and then to create a
voltage gradient to accelerate the ions to high exhaust velocities.
The idea of electric propulsion dates back to 1906, when Robert_Goddard
considered the possibility in his personal notebook.[14] Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky
published the idea in 1911.
For these drives, at the highest exhaust speeds, energetic efficiency and
thrust are all inversely proportional to exhaust velocity. Their very high
exhaust velocity means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with
practical power sources provide low thrust, but use hardly any fuel.
For some missions, particularly reasonably close to the Sun, solar_energy may
be sufficient, and has very often been used, but for others further out or at
higher power, nuclear energy is necessary; engines drawing their power from a
nuclear source are called nuclear_electric_rockets.
With any current source of electrical power, chemical, nuclear or solar, the
maximum amount of power that can be generated limits the amount of thrust that
can be produced to a small value. Power generation adds significant mass to the
spacecraft, and ultimately the weight of the power source limits the
performance of the vehicle.
Current nuclear power generators are approximately half the weight of solar
panels per watt of energy supplied, at terrestrial distances from the Sun.
Chemical power generators are not used due to the far lower total available
energy. Beamed power to the spacecraft shows some potential.

          o Hall_effect_thruster
          o Colloid_thruster
    * Electrothermal thrusters (electromagnetic fields are used to generate a
      plasma to increase the heat of the bulk propellant, the thermal energy
      imparted to the propellant gas is then converted into kinetic energy by a
      nozzle of either physical material construction or by magnetic means)

          o microwave_arcjet
          o Helicon_Double_Layer_Thruster
    * Electromagnetic thrusters (ions are accelerated either by the Lorentz
      Force or by the effect of electromagnetic fields where the electric field
      is not in the direction of the acceleration)

accelerated simultaneously, no neutralizer is required.
**** Without internal reaction mass[edit] ****
NASA study of a solar sail. The sail would be half a kilometer wide.
The law_of_conservation of momentum is usually taken to imply that any engine
which uses no reaction mass cannot accelerate the center of mass of a spaceship
(changing orientation, on the other hand, is possible). But space is not empty,
especially space inside the Solar System; there are gravitation fields,
magnetic_fields, electromagnetic_waves, solar_wind and solar radiation.
Electromagnetic waves in particular are known to contain momentum, despite
being massless; specifically the momentum flux density P of an EM wave is
quantitatively 1/c^2 times the Poynting_vector S, i.e. P = S/c^2, where c is
the velocity of light. Field_propulsion methods which do not rely on reaction
mass thus must try to take advantage of this fact by coupling to a momentum-
bearing field such as an EM wave that exists in the vicinity of the craft.
However, because many of these phenomena are diffuse in nature, corresponding
propulsion structures need to be proportionately large.[original_research?]
There are several different space drives that need little or no reaction mass
to function. A tether_propulsion system employs a long cable with a high
tensile strength to change a spacecraft's orbit, such as by interaction with a
planet's magnetic field or through momentum exchange with another object.[15]
Solar_sails rely on radiation_pressure from electromagnetic energy, but they
require a large collection surface to function effectively. The magnetic_sail
deflects charged particles from the solar_wind with a magnetic field, thereby
imparting momentum to the spacecraft. A variant is the mini-magnetospheric
plasma_propulsion system, which uses a small cloud of plasma held in a magnetic
field to deflect the Sun's charged particles. An E-sail would use very thin and
lightweight wires holding an electric charge to deflect these particles, and
may have more controllable directionality.
As a proof of concept, NanoSail-D became the first nanosatellite to orbit
Earth.[16][full_citation_needed] There are plans to add them[clarification
needed] to future Earth orbit satellites, enabling them to de-orbit and burn up
once they are no longer needed. Cubesail will be the first mission to
demonstrate solar sailing in low Earth orbit, and the first mission to
demonstrate full three-axis attitude control of a solar sail.[17]
Japan also launched its own solar sail powered spacecraft IKAROS in May 2010.
IKAROS successfully demonstrated propulsion and guidance and is still flying
today.
A satellite or other space vehicle is subject to the law_of_conservation_of
angular_momentum, which constrains a body from a net_change in angular
velocity. Thus, for a vehicle to change its relative_orientation without
expending reaction mass, another part of the vehicle may rotate in the opposite
direction. Non-conservative external forces, primarily gravitational and
atmospheric, can contribute up to several degrees per day to angular momentum,
[18] so secondary systems are designed to "bleed off" undesired rotational
energies built up over time. Accordingly, many spacecraft utilize reaction
wheels or control_moment_gyroscopes to control orientation in space.[19]
A gravitational_slingshot can carry a space_probe onward to other destinations
without the expense of reaction mass. By harnessing the gravitational energy of
other celestial objects, the spacecraft can pick up kinetic energy.[20]
However, even more energy can be obtained from the gravity assist if rockets
are used.
Beam-powered_propulsion is another method of propulsion without reaction mass.
Beamed propulsion includes sails pushed by laser, microwave, or particle beams.
***** Planetary and atmospheric propulsion[edit] *****
A successful proof of concept Lightcraft test, a subset of beam-powered
propulsion.
**** Launch-assist mechanisms[edit] ****
Main article: Space_launch
There have been many ideas proposed for launch-assist mechanisms that have the
potential of drastically reducing the cost of getting into orbit. Proposed non-
rocket_spacelaunch launch-assist mechanisms include:
    * Skyhook (requires reusable suborbital launch vehicle, not engineeringly
      feasible using presently available materials)
    * Space_elevator (tether from Earth's surface to geostationary orbit,
      cannot be built with existing materials)
    * Launch_loop (a very fast enclosed rotating loop about 80 km tall)
    * Space_fountain (a very tall building held up by a stream of masses fired
      from its base)
    * Orbital_ring (a ring around Earth with spokes hanging down off bearings)
    * Electromagnetic_catapult (railgun, coilgun) (an electric gun)
    * Rocket_sled_launch
    * Space_gun (Project_HARP, ram_accelerator) (a chemically powered gun)
    * Beam-powered_propulsion rockets and jets powered from the ground via a
      beam
    * High-altitude_platforms to assist initial stage
**** Air-breathing engines[edit] ****
Main articles: Jet_engine and Air-breathing_electric_propulsion
Studies generally show that conventional air-breathing engines, such as ramjets
or turbojets are basically too heavy (have too low a thrust/weight ratio) to
give any significant performance improvement when installed on a launch vehicle
itself. However, launch vehicles can be air_launched from separate lift
vehicles (e.g. B-29, Pegasus_Rocket and White_Knight) which do use such
propulsion systems. Jet engines mounted on a launch rail could also be so used.
On the other hand, very lightweight or very high speed engines have been
proposed that take advantage of the air during ascent:
    * SABRE - a lightweight hydrogen fuelled turbojet with precooler[21]
    * ATREX - a lightweight hydrogen fuelled turbojet with precooler[22]
    * Liquid_air_cycle_engine - a hydrogen fuelled jet engine that liquifies
      the air before burning it in a rocket engine
    * Scramjet - jet engines that use supersonic combustion
    * Shcramjet - similar to a scramjet engine, however it takes advantage of
      shockwaves produced from the aircraft in the combustion chamber to assist
      in increasing overall efficiency.
Normal rocket launch vehicles fly almost vertically before rolling over at an
altitude of some tens of kilometers before burning sideways for orbit; this
initial vertical climb wastes propellant but is optimal as it greatly reduces
airdrag. Airbreathing engines burn propellant much more efficiently and this
would permit a far flatter launch trajectory, the vehicles would typically fly
approximately tangentially to Earth's surface until leaving the atmosphere then
perform a rocket burn to bridge the final delta-v to orbital velocity.
For spacecraft already in very low-orbit, air-breathing_electric_propulsion
would use residual gases in the upper atmosphere as propellant. Air-breathing
electric propulsion could make a new class of long-lived, low-orbiting missions
feasible on Earth, Mars or Venus.[23][24]
**** Planetary arrival and landing[edit] ****
A test version of the MARS Pathfinder airbag system
When a vehicle is to enter orbit around its destination planet, or when it is
to land, it must adjust its velocity. This can be done using all the methods
listed above (provided they can generate a high enough thrust), but there are a
few methods that can take advantage of planetary atmospheres and/or surfaces.
    * Aerobraking allows a spacecraft to reduce the high point of an elliptical
      orbit by repeated brushes with the atmosphere at the low point of the
      orbit. This can save a considerable amount of fuel because it takes much
      less delta-V to enter an elliptical orbit compared to a low circular
      orbit. Because the braking is done over the course of many orbits,
      heating is comparatively minor, and a heat shield is not required. This
      has been done on several Mars missions such as Mars_Global_Surveyor, Mars
      Odyssey and Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter, and at least one Venus mission,
      Magellan.
    * Aerocapture is a much more aggressive manoeuver, converting an incoming
      hyperbolic orbit to an elliptical orbit in one pass. This requires a heat
      shield and much trickier navigation, because it must be completed in one
      pass through the atmosphere, and unlike aerobraking no preview of the
      atmosphere is possible. If the intent is to remain in orbit, then at
      least one more propulsive maneuver is required after
      aerocaptureâotherwise the low point of the resulting orbit will remain
      in the atmosphere, resulting in eventual re-entry. Aerocapture has not
      yet been tried on a planetary mission, but the re-entry_skip by Zond_6
      and Zond_7 upon lunar return were aerocapture maneuvers, because they
      turned a hyperbolic orbit into an elliptical orbit. On these missions,
      because there was no attempt to raise the perigee after the aerocapture,
      the resulting orbit still intersected the atmosphere, and re-entry
      occurred at the next perigee.
    * A ballute is an inflatable drag device.
    * Parachutes can land a probe on a planet or moon with an atmosphere,
      usually after the atmosphere has scrubbed off most of the velocity, using
      a heat_shield.
    * Airbags can soften the final landing.
    * Lithobraking, or stopping by impacting the surface, is usually done by
      accident. However, it may be done deliberately with the probe expected to
      survive (see, for example, Deep_Impact_(spacecraft)), in which case very
      sturdy probes are required.
***** Table of methods[edit] *****
Below is a summary of some of the more popular, proven technologies, followed
by increasingly speculative methods.
Four numbers are shown. The first is the effective_exhaust_velocity: the
equivalent speed that the propellant leaves the vehicle. This is not
necessarily the most important characteristic of the propulsion method; thrust
and power consumption and other factors can be. However:
    * if the delta-v is much more than the exhaust velocity, then exorbitant
      amounts of fuel are necessary (see the section on calculations, above)
    * if it is much more than the delta-v, then, proportionally more energy is
      needed; if the power is limited, as with solar energy, this means that
      the journey takes a proportionally longer time
The second and third are the typical amounts of thrust and the typical burn
times of the method. Outside a gravitational potential small amounts of thrust
applied over a long period will give the same effect as large amounts of thrust
over a short period. (This result does not apply when the object is
significantly influenced by gravity.)
The fourth is the maximum delta-v this technique can give (without staging).
For rocket-like propulsion systems this is a function of mass fraction and
exhaust velocity. Mass fraction for rocket-like systems is usually limited by
propulsion system weight and tankage weight. For a system to achieve this
limit, typically the payload may need to be a negligible percentage of the
vehicle, and so the practical limit on some systems can be much lower.

***** Testing[edit] *****
Spacecraft propulsion systems are often first statically tested on Earth's
surface, within the atmosphere but many systems require a vacuum chamber to
test fully. Rockets are usually tested at a rocket_engine_test_facility well
away from habitation and other buildings for safety reasons. Ion_drives are far
less dangerous and require much less stringent safety, usually only a large-ish
vacuum chamber is needed.
Famous static test locations can be found at Rocket_Ground_Test_Facilities
Some systems cannot be adequately tested on the ground and test launches may be
employed at a Rocket_Launch_Site.
***** Speculative methods[edit] *****
Artist's conception of a warp drive design
A variety of hypothetical propulsion techniques have been considered that
require a deeper understanding of the properties of space, particularly
inertial_frames and the vacuum_state. To date, such methods are highly
speculative and include:
    * Black_hole_starship
    * Differential_sail
    * Faster-than-light
    * Field_propulsion
          o RF_resonant_cavity_thruster
    * Gravitational_shielding
          o Diametric drive
          o Disjunction drive
          o Pitch drive
          o Bias drive
    * Photon_rocket
    * Photonic_laser_thruster
    * Quantum_vacuum_thruster
    * Reactionless_drive
          o AbrahamâMinkowski_drive
          o Alcubierre_drive
          o Heim_drive
          o Dean_drive
          o Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster (GIT)
          o Woodward_effect
A NASA assessment of its Breakthrough_Propulsion_Physics_Program divides such
proposals into those that are non-viable for propulsion purposes, those that
are of uncertain potential, and those that are not impossible according to
current theories.[43]

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ With things moving around in orbits and nothing staying still, the
      question may be quite reasonably asked, stationary relative to what? The
      answer is for the energy to be zero (and in the absence of gravity which
      complicates the issue somewhat), the exhaust must stop relative to the
      initial motion of the rocket before the engines were switched on. It is
      possible to do calculations from other reference frames, but
      consideration for the kinetic energy of the exhaust and propellant needs
      to be given. In Newtonian mechanics the initial position of the rocket is
      the centre_of_mass_frame for the rocket/propellant/exhaust, and has the
      minimum energy of any frame.

Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and
artificial satellites. Space propulsion or in-space propulsion exclusively
deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should not be
confused with launch_vehicles. Several methods, both pragmatic and
hypothetical, have been developed each having its own drawbacks and advantages.
Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant
rockets) or resistojet_rockets for orbital_station-keeping and some use
momentum_wheels for attitude_control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric
propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting
to use them for north-south station-keeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary
vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used Ion
thrusters and Hall_effect_thrusters (two different types of electric
propulsion) to great success.

***** Requirements[edit] *****
Further information: Escape_velocity
Artificial satellites are first launched into the desired altitude by
conventional liquid/solid propelled rockets after which the satellite may use
onboard propulsion systems for orbital stationkeeping. Once in the desired
orbit, they often need some form of attitude_control so that they are correctly
pointed with respect to the Earth, the Sun, and possibly some astronomical
object of interest.[1] They are also subject to drag from the thin atmosphere,
so that to stay in orbit for a long period of time some form of propulsion is
occasionally necessary to make small corrections (orbital_station-keeping).[2]
Many satellites need to be moved from one orbit to another from time to time,
and this also requires propulsion.[3] A satellite's useful life is usually over
once it has exhausted its ability to adjust its orbit.
For interplanetary_travel, a spacecraft can use its engines to leave Earth's
orbit. It is not explicitly necessary as the initial boost given by the rocket,
gravity slingshot, monopropellant/bipropellent attitude control propulsion
system are enough for the exploration of the solar system (see New_Horizons).
Once it has done so, it must somehow make its way to its destination. Current
interplanetary spacecraft do this with a series of short-term trajectory
adjustments.[4] In between these adjustments, the spacecraft simply moves along
its trajectory with a constant velocity. The most fuel-efficient means to move
from one circular orbit to another is with a Hohmann_transfer_orbit: the
spacecraft begins in a roughly circular orbit around the Sun. A short period of
thrust in the direction of motion accelerates or decelerates the spacecraft
into an elliptical orbit around the Sun which is tangential to its previous
orbit and also to the orbit of its destination. The spacecraft falls freely
along this elliptical orbit until it reaches its destination, where another
short period of thrust accelerates or decelerates it to match the orbit of its
destination.[5] Special methods such as aerobraking or aerocapture are
sometimes used for this final orbital adjustment.[6]
Artist's concept of a solar sail
Some spacecraft propulsion methods such as solar_sails provide very low but
inexhaustible thrust;[7] an interplanetary vehicle using one of these methods
would follow a rather different trajectory, either constantly thrusting against
its direction of motion in order to decrease its distance from the Sun or
constantly thrusting along its direction of motion to increase its distance
from the Sun. The concept has been successfully tested by the Japanese IKAROS
solar sail spacecraft.
No spacecraft capable of short duration (compared to human lifetime)
interstellar_travel has yet been built, but many hypothetical designs have been
discussed. Because interstellar distances are very great, a tremendous velocity
is needed to get a spacecraft to its destination in a reasonable amount of
time. Acquiring such a velocity on launch and getting rid of it on arrival
remains a formidable challenge for spacecraft designers.[8]
***** Effectiveness[edit] *****
When in space, the purpose of a propulsion_system is to change the velocity, or
v, of a spacecraft. Because this is more difficult for more massive
spacecrafts, designers generally discuss spacecraft performance in amount of
change in momentum per unit of propellant consumed also called specific
impulse.[9] Higher the specific impulse, better the efficiency. Ion propulsion
engines have high specific impulse (~3000 s) and low thrust[10] whereas
chemical rockets like monopropellant or bipropellant rocket engines have a low
specific impulse (~300 s) but high thrust[11].
When launching a spacecraft from Earth, a propulsion method must overcome a
higher gravitational pull to provide a positive net acceleration.[12] In orbit,
any additional impulse, even very tiny, will result in a change in the orbit
path.
1) Prograde/Retrogade (i.e. acceleration in the tangential/opposite in
tangential direction) - Increases/Decreases altitude of orbit
2) Perpendicular to orbital plane - Changes Orbital_inclination
The rate of change of velocity is called acceleration, and the rate of change
of momentum is called force. To reach a given velocity, one can apply a small
acceleration over a long period of time, or one can apply a large acceleration
over a short time. Similarly, one can achieve a given impulse with a large
force over a short time or a small force over a long time. This means that for
manoeuvring in space, a propulsion method that produces tiny accelerations but
runs for a long time can produce the same impulse as a propulsion method that
produces large accelerations for a short time. When launching from a planet,
tiny accelerations cannot overcome the planet's gravitational pull and so
cannot be used.
Earth's surface is situated fairly deep in a gravity_well. The escape_velocity
required to get out of it is 11.2 kilometers/second. As human beings evolved in
a gravitational field of 1g (9.8 m/sÂ²), an ideal propulsion system would be
one that provides a continuous acceleration of 1g (though human bodies can
tolerate much larger accelerations over short periods). The occupants of a
rocket or spaceship having such a propulsion system would be free from all the
ill effects of free_fall, such as nausea, muscular weakness, reduced sense of
taste, or leaching of calcium from their bones.
The law of conservation_of_momentum means that in order for a propulsion method
to change the momentum of a space craft it must change the momentum of
something else as well. A few designs take advantage of things like magnetic
fields or light pressure in order to change the spacecraft's momentum, but in
free space the rocket must bring along some mass to accelerate away in order to
push itself forward. Such mass is called reaction_mass.
In order for a rocket to work, it needs two things: reaction mass and energy.
The impulse provided by launching a particle of reaction mass having mass m at
velocity v is mv. But this particle has kinetic energy mvÂ²/2, which must come
from somewhere. In a conventional solid, liquid, or hybrid_rocket, the fuel is
burned, providing the energy, and the reaction products are allowed to flow out
the back, providing the reaction mass. In an ion_thruster, electricity is used
to accelerate ions out the back. Here some other source must provide the
electrical energy (perhaps a solar_panel or a nuclear_reactor), whereas the
ions provide the reaction mass.[12]
When discussing the efficiency of a propulsion system, designers often focus on
effectively using the reaction mass. Reaction mass must be carried along with
the rocket and is irretrievably consumed when used. One way of measuring the
amount of impulse that can be obtained from a fixed amount of reaction mass is
the specific_impulse, the impulse per unit weight-on-Earth (typically
designated by      I  sp     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}]).
The unit for this value is seconds. Because the weight on Earth of the reaction
mass is often unimportant when discussing vehicles in space, specific impulse
can also be discussed in terms of impulse per unit mass. This alternate form of
specific impulse uses the same units as velocity (e.g. m/s), and in fact it is
equal to the effective exhaust velocity of the engine (typically designated
v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}  [v_{e}]). Confusingly, both values are
sometimes called specific impulse. The two values differ by a factor of gn, the
standard acceleration due to gravity 9.80665 m/sÂ² (     I  sp    g   n    =  v
e     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}g_{\mathrm {n} }=v_{e}}  [{\displaystyle I_
{\text{sp}}g_{\mathrm {n} }=v_{e}}]).
A rocket with a high exhaust velocity can achieve the same impulse with less
reaction mass. However, the energy required for that impulse is proportional to
the exhaust velocity, so that more mass-efficient engines require much more
energy, and are typically less energy efficient. This is a problem if the
engine is to provide a large amount of thrust. To generate a large amount of
impulse per second, it must use a large amount of energy per second. So high-
mass-efficient engines require enormous amounts of energy per second to produce
high thrusts. As a result, most high-mass-efficient engine designs also provide
lower thrust due to the unavailability of high amounts of energy.
***** Methods[edit] *****
Propulsion methods can be classified based on their means of accelerating the
reaction mass. There are also some special methods for launches, planetary
arrivals, and landings.
**** Reaction engines[edit] ****
Main article: Reaction_engine
A reaction engine is an engine which provides propulsion by expelling reaction
mass, in accordance with Newton's_third_law_of_motion. This law of motion is
most commonly paraphrased as: "For every action there is an equal, and
opposite, reaction".
Examples include both duct_engines and rocket_engines, and more uncommon
variations such as Hall_effect_thrusters, ion_drives and mass_drivers. Duct
engines are obviously not used for space propulsion due to the lack of air;
however some proposed spacecraft have these kinds of engines to assist takeoff
and landing.
*** Delta-v and propellant[edit] ***
Rocket mass_ratios versus final velocity, as calculated from the rocket
equation
Exhausting the entire usable propellant of a spacecraft through the engines in
a straight line in free space would produce a net velocity change to the
vehicle; this number is termed delta-v (    &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta
v}  [\Delta v]).
If the exhaust velocity is constant then the total     &#x0394; v
{\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] of a vehicle can be calculated using the
rocket equation, where M is the mass of propellant, P is the mass of the
payload (including the rocket structure), and      v  e     {\displaystyle v_
{e}}  [v_{e}] is the velocity_of_the_rocket_exhaust. This is known as the
Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation:
         &#x0394; v =  v  e   ln &#x2061;  (    M + P  P   )  .
      {\displaystyle \Delta v=v_{e}\ln \left({\frac {M+P}{P}}\right).}
      [ \Delta v = v_e \ln \left(\frac{M+P}{P}\right). ]
For historical reasons, as discussed above,      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}
[v_{e}] is sometimes written as
          v  e   =  I  sp    g  0     {\displaystyle v_{e}=I_{\text{sp}}g_{0}}
      [{\displaystyle v_{e}=I_{\text{sp}}g_{0}}]
where      I  sp     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}] is the
specific_impulse of the rocket, measured in seconds, and      g  0
{\displaystyle g_{0}}  [g_{0}] is the gravitational_acceleration at sea level.
For a high delta-v mission, the majority of the spacecraft's mass needs to be
reaction mass. Because a rocket must carry all of its reaction mass, most of
the initially-expended reaction mass goes towards accelerating reaction mass
rather than payload. If the rocket has a payload of mass P, the spacecraft
needs to change its velocity by     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}
[\Delta v], and the rocket engine has exhaust velocity ve, then the reaction
mass M which is needed can be calculated using the rocket equation and the
formula for      I  sp     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}]:
         M = P  (   e    &#x0394; v   v  e      &#x2212; 1  )  .
      {\displaystyle M=P\left(e^{\frac {\Delta v}{v_{e}}}-1\right).}  [
      {\displaystyle M=P\left(e^{\frac {\Delta v}{v_{e}}}-1\right).}]
For     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] much smaller than ve,
this equation is roughly linear, and little reaction mass is needed. If
&#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] is comparable to ve, then
there needs to be about twice as much fuel as combined payload and structure
(which includes engines, fuel tanks, and so on). Beyond this, the growth is
exponential; speeds much higher than the exhaust velocity require very high
ratios of fuel mass to payload and structural mass.
For a mission, for example, when launching from or landing on a planet, the
effects of gravitational attraction and any atmospheric drag must be overcome
by using fuel. It is typical to combine the effects of these and other effects
into an effective mission delta-v. For example, a launch mission to low Earth
orbit requires about 9.3â10 km/s delta-v. These mission delta-vs are
typically numerically integrated on a computer.
Some effects such as Oberth_effect can only be significantly utilised by high
thrust engines such as rockets; i.e., engines that can produce a high g-force
(thrust per unit mass, equal to delta-v per unit time).
*** Power use and propulsive efficiency[edit] ***
For all reaction_engines (such as rockets and ion drives) some energy must go
into accelerating the reaction mass. Every engine will waste some energy, but
even assuming 100% efficiency, to accelerate an exhaust the engine will need
energy amounting to
           1 2      m &#x02D9;     v  e   2     {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}
      {\dot {m}}v_{e}^{2}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}{\dot {m}}v_{e}^{2}}]
      [13]
This energy is not necessarily lost- some of it usually ends up as kinetic
energy of the vehicle, and the rest is wasted in residual motion of the
exhaust.
Due to energy carried away in the exhaust, the energy efficiency of a reaction
engine varies with the speed of the exhaust relative to the speed of the
vehicle, this is called propulsive_efficiency
Comparing the rocket equation (which shows how much energy ends up in the final
vehicle) and the above equation (which shows the total energy required) shows
that even with 100% engine efficiency, certainly not all energy supplied ends
up in the vehicle - some of it, indeed usually most of it, ends up as kinetic
energy of the exhaust.
The exact amount depends on the design of the vehicle, and the mission.
However, there are some useful fixed points:
    * if the      I  sp     {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}] is
      fixed, for a mission delta-v, there is a particular      I  sp
      {\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}  [I_{\text{sp}}] that minimises the overall
      energy used by the rocket. This comes to an exhaust velocity of about â
      of the mission delta-v (see the_energy_computed_from_the_rocket
      equation). Drives with a specific impulse that is both high and fixed
      such as Ion thrusters have exhaust velocities that can be enormously
      higher than this ideal for many missions.
    * if the exhaust velocity can be made to vary so that at each instant it is
      equal and opposite to the vehicle velocity then the absolute minimum
      energy usage is achieved. When this is achieved, the exhaust stops in
      space [1] and has no kinetic energy; and the propulsive efficiency is
      100%- all the energy ends up in the vehicle (in principle such a drive
      would be 100% efficient, in practice there would be thermal losses from
      within the drive system and residual heat in the exhaust). However, in
      most cases this uses an impractical quantity of propellant, but is a
      useful theoretical consideration. Anyway, the vehicle has to move before
      the method can be applied.
Some drives (such as VASIMR or electrodeless_plasma_thruster) actually can
significantly vary their exhaust velocity. This can help reduce propellant
usage or improve acceleration at different stages of the flight. However the
best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the exhaust
velocity is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually
have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of
VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15000 m/s compared to a mission delta-
v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about 4000 m/s).
It might be thought that adding power generation capacity is helpful, and
although initially this can improve performance, this inevitably increases the
weight of the power source, and eventually the mass of the power source and the
associated engines and propellant dominates the weight of the vehicle, and then
adding more power gives no significant improvement.
For, although solar_power and nuclear power are virtually unlimited sources of
energy, the maximum power they can supply is substantially proportional to the
mass of the powerplant (i.e. specific_power takes a largely constant value
which is dependent on the particular powerplant technology). For any given
specific power, with a large      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}  [v_{e}] which
is desirable to save propellant mass, it turns out that the maximum
acceleration is inversely proportional to      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}
[v_{e}]. Hence the time to reach a required delta-v is proportional to      v
e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}  [v_{e}]. Thus the latter should not be too large.
*** Energy[edit] ***
Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a
vehicle accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency
In the ideal case      m  1     {\displaystyle m_{1}}  [m_{1}] is useful
payload and      m  0   &#x2212;  m  1     {\displaystyle m_{0}-m_{1}}  [m_0-
m_1] is reaction mass (this corresponds to empty tanks having no mass, etc.).
The energy required can simply be computed as
           1 2   (  m  0   &#x2212;  m  1   )  v  e   2     {\displaystyle
      {\frac {1}{2}}(m_{0}-m_{1})v_{\text{e}}^{2}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1}
      {2}}(m_{0}-m_{1})v_{\text{e}}^{2}}]
This corresponds to the kinetic energy the expelled reaction mass would have at
a speed equal to the exhaust speed. If the reaction mass had to be accelerated
from zero speed to the exhaust speed, all energy produced would go into the
reaction mass and nothing would be left for kinetic energy gain by the rocket
and payload. However, if the rocket already moves and accelerates (the reaction
mass is expelled in the direction opposite to the direction in which the rocket
moves) less kinetic energy is added to the reaction mass. To see this, if, for
example,      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{e}}  [v_{e}]=10 km/s and the speed of
the rocket is 3 km/s, then the speed of a small amount of expended reaction
mass changes from 3 km/s forwards to 7 km/s rearwards. Thus, although the
energy required is 50 MJ per kg reaction mass, only 20 MJ is used for the
increase in speed of the reaction mass. The remaining 30 MJ is the increase of
the kinetic energy of the rocket and payload.
In general:
         d  (    1 2    v  2    )  = v d v = v  v  e      d m  m   =   1 2
      [   v  e   2   &#x2212;   (  v &#x2212;  v  e    )   2   +  v  2    ]
      d m  m     {\displaystyle d\left({\frac {1}{2}}v^{2}\right)=vdv=vv_{\text
      {e}}{\frac {dm}{m}}={\frac {1}{2}}\left[v_{\text{e}}^{2}-\left(v-v_{\text
      {e}}\right)^{2}+v^{2}\right]{\frac {dm}{m}}}  [{\displaystyle d\left(
      {\frac {1}{2}}v^{2}\right)=vdv=vv_{\text{e}}{\frac {dm}{m}}={\frac {1}
      {2}}\left[v_{\text{e}}^{2}-\left(v-v_{\text{e}}\right)^{2}+v^{2}\right]
      {\frac {dm}{m}}}]
Thus the specific energy gain of the rocket in any small time interval is the
energy gain of the rocket including the remaining fuel, divided by its mass,
where the energy gain is equal to the energy produced by the fuel minus the
energy gain of the reaction mass. The larger the speed of the rocket, the
smaller the energy gain of the reaction mass; if the rocket speed is more than
half of the exhaust speed the reaction mass even loses energy on being
expelled, to the benefit of the energy gain of the rocket; the larger the speed
of the rocket, the larger the energy loss of the reaction mass.
We have
         &#x0394; &#x03F5; = &#x222B; v  d ( &#x0394; v )   {\displaystyle
      \Delta \epsilon =\int v\,d(\Delta v)}  [\Delta \epsilon =  \int v\, d
      (\Delta v)]
where     &#x03F5;   {\displaystyle \epsilon }  [\epsilon ] is the specific
energy of the rocket (potential plus kinetic energy) and     &#x0394; v
{\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] is a separate variable, not just the
change in     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v]. In the case of using the rocket for
deceleration; i.e., expelling reaction mass in the direction of the velocity,
v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] should be taken negative.
The formula is for the ideal case again, with no energy lost on heat, etc. The
latter causes a reduction of thrust, so it is a disadvantage even when the
objective is to lose energy (deceleration).
If the energy is produced by the mass itself, as in a chemical rocket, the fuel
value has to be        v  e   2    /  2     {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {v_
{\text{e}}^{2}/2}}  [\scriptstyle{v_\text{e}^2/2}], where for the fuel value
also the mass of the oxidizer has to be taken into account. A typical value is
v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_{\text{e}}] = 4.5 km/s, corresponding
to a fuel value of 10.1 MJ/kg. The actual fuel value is higher, but much of the
energy is lost as waste heat in the exhaust that the nozzle was unable to
extract.
The required energy     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] is
         E =   1 2    m  1    (   e    &#x0394; v   v  e      &#x2212; 1  )   v
      e   2     {\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}m_{1}\left(e^{\frac {\Delta v}
      {v_{\text{e}}}}-1\right)v_{\text{e}}^{2}}  [{\displaystyle E={\frac {1}
      {2}}m_{1}\left(e^{\frac {\Delta v}{v_{\text{e}}}}-1\right)v_{\text{e}}^
      {2}}]
Conclusions:
    * for     &#x0394; v &#x226A;  v  e     {\displaystyle \Delta v\ll v_{e}}
      [\Delta v \ll v_e] we have     E &#x2248;   1 2    m  1    v  e
      &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle E\approx {\frac {1}{2}}m_{1}v_{\text
      {e}}\Delta v}  [{\displaystyle E\approx {\frac {1}{2}}m_{1}v_{\text
      {e}}\Delta v}]
    * for a given     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v], the
      minimum energy is needed if      v  e   = 0.6275 &#x0394; v
      {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}=0.6275\Delta v}  [{\displaystyle v_{\text
      {e}}=0.6275\Delta v}], requiring an energy of
         E = 0.772  m  1   ( &#x0394; v  )  2     {\displaystyle E=0.772m_{1}
      (\Delta v)^{2}}  [E = 0.772 m_1(\Delta v)^2].
      In the case of acceleration in a fixed direction, and starting from zero
      speed, and in the absence of other forces, this is 54.4% more than just
      the final kinetic energy of the payload. In this optimal case the initial
      mass is 4.92 times the final mass.
These results apply for a fixed exhaust speed.
Due to the Oberth_effect and starting from a nonzero speed, the required
potential energy needed from the propellant may be less than the increase in
energy in the vehicle and payload. This can be the case when the reaction mass
has a lower speed after being expelled than before â rockets are able to
liberate some or all of the initial kinetic energy of the propellant.
Also, for a given objective such as moving from one orbit to another, the
required     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] may depend
greatly on the rate at which the engine can produce     &#x0394; v
{\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] and maneuvers may even be impossible if
that rate is too low. For example, a launch to Low_Earth_orbit (LEO) normally
requires a     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] of ca. 9.5 km/
s (mostly for the speed to be acquired), but if the engine could produce
&#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] at a rate of only slightly
more than g, it would be a slow launch requiring altogether a very large
&#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] (think of hovering without
making any progress in speed or altitude, it would cost a     &#x0394; v
{\displaystyle \Delta v}  [\Delta v] of 9.8 m/s each second). If the possible
rate is only     g   {\displaystyle g}  [g] or less, the maneuver can not be
carried out at all with this engine.

         P =   1 2   m a  v  e   =   1 2   F  v  e     {\displaystyle P={\frac
      {1}{2}}mav_{\text{e}}={\frac {1}{2}}Fv_{\text{e}}}  [{\displaystyle P=
      {\frac {1}{2}}mav_{\text{e}}={\frac {1}{2}}Fv_{\text{e}}}]
where     F   {\displaystyle F}  [F] is the thrust and     a   {\displaystyle
a}  [a] the acceleration due to it. Thus the theoretically possible thrust per
unit power is 2 divided by the specific impulse in m/s. The thrust efficiency
is the actual thrust as percentage of this.
If, e.g., solar_power is used, this restricts     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a];
in the case of a large      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_{\text
{e}}] the possible acceleration is inversely proportional to it, hence the time
to reach a required delta-v is proportional to      v  e     {\displaystyle v_
{\text{e}}}  [v_{\text{e}}]; with 100% efficiency:
    * for     &#x0394; v &#x226A;  v  e     {\displaystyle \Delta v\ll v_{\text
      {e}}}  [\Delta v \ll v_\text{e}] we have     t &#x2248;    m  v  e
      &#x0394; v   2 P      {\displaystyle t\approx {\frac {mv_{\text{e}}\Delta
      v}{2P}}}  [{\displaystyle t\approx {\frac {mv_{\text{e}}\Delta v}{2P}}}]
Examples:
    * power, 1000 W; mass, 100 kg;     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}
      [\Delta v] = 5 km/s,      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_
      {\text{e}}] = 16 km/s, takes 1.5 months.
    * power, 1000 W; mass, 100 kg;     &#x0394; v   {\displaystyle \Delta v}
      [\Delta v] = 5 km/s,      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_
      {\text{e}}] = 50 km/s, takes 5 months.
Thus      v  e     {\displaystyle v_{\text{e}}}  [v_{\text{e}}] should not be
too large.
*** Power to thrust ratio[edit] ***
The power to thrust ratio is simply:[13]
           P F   =      1 2       m &#x02D9;     v  2         m &#x02D9;    v
      =   1 2   v   {\displaystyle {\frac {P}{F}}={\frac {{\frac {1}{2}}{{\dot
      {m}}v^{2}}}{{\dot {m}}v}}={\frac {1}{2}}v}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {P}
      {F}}={\frac {{\frac {1}{2}}{{\dot {m}}v^{2}}}{{\dot {m}}v}}={\frac {1}
      {2}}v}]
Thus for any vehicle power P, the thrust that may be provided is:
         F =   P    1 2   v    =    2 P  v     {\displaystyle F={\frac {P}{
      {\frac {1}{2}}v}}={\frac {2P}{v}}}  [{\displaystyle F={\frac {P}{{\frac
      {1}{2}}v}}={\frac {2P}{v}}}]

   2. ^ Assumes a specific power of 1 kW/kg
Observe that the more fuel-efficient engines can use far less fuel; their mass
is almost negligible (relative to the mass of the payload and the engine
itself) for some of the engines. However, note also that these require a large
total amount of energy. For Earth launch, engines require a thrust to weight
ratio of more than one. To do this with the ion or more theoretical electrical
drives, the engine would have to be supplied with one to several gigawatts of
power, equivalent to a major metropolitan generating_station. From the table it
can be seen that this is clearly impractical with current power sources.
Alternative approaches include some forms of laser_propulsion, where the
reaction_mass does not provide the energy required to accelerate it, with the
energy instead being provided from an external laser or other beam-powered
propulsion system. Small models of some of these concepts have flown, although
the engineering problems are complex and the ground-based power systems are not
a solved problem.
Instead, a much smaller, less powerful generator may be included which will
take much longer to generate the total energy needed. This lower power is only
sufficient to accelerate a tiny amount of fuel per second, and would be
insufficient for launching from Earth. However, over long periods in orbit
where there is no friction, the velocity will be finally achieved. For example,
it took the SMART-1 more than a year to reach the Moon, whereas with a chemical
rocket it takes a few days. Because the ion drive needs much less fuel, the
total launched mass is usually lower, which typically results in a lower
overall cost, but the journey takes longer.
Mission planning therefore frequently involves adjusting and choosing the
propulsion system so as to minimise the total cost of the project, and can
involve trading off launch costs and mission duration against payload fraction.
*** Rocket engines[edit] ***
Main article: Rocket_engine
SpaceX's Kestrel_engine is tested
Most rocket engines are internal_combustion heat_engines (although non
combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature
reaction mass, as a hot gas. This is achieved by combusting a solid, liquid or
gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot
gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This bell-
shaped nozzle is what gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The
effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of
the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10
times the speed of sound at sea level are common.
Rocket engines provide essentially the highest specific powers and high
specific thrusts of any engine used for spacecraft propulsion.
Ion propulsion rockets can heat a plasma or charged gas inside a magnetic
bottle and release it via a magnetic_nozzle, so that no solid matter need come
in contact with the plasma. Of course, the machinery to do this is complex, but
research into nuclear_fusion has developed methods, some of which have been
proposed to be used in propulsion systems, and some have been tested in a lab.
See rocket_engine for a listing of various kinds of rocket engines using
different heating methods, including chemical, electrical, solar, and nuclear.
*** Electromagnetic propulsion[edit] ***
This test engine accelerates ions using electrostatic forces
Main article: Electrically_powered_spacecraft_propulsion
Rather than relying on high temperature and fluid_dynamics to accelerate the
reaction mass to high speeds, there are a variety of methods that use
electrostatic or electromagnetic forces to accelerate the reaction mass
directly. Usually the reaction mass is a stream of ions. Such an engine
typically uses electric power, first to ionize atoms, and then to create a
voltage gradient to accelerate the ions to high exhaust velocities.
The idea of electric propulsion dates back to 1906, when Robert_Goddard
considered the possibility in his personal notebook.[14] Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky
published the idea in 1911.
For these drives, at the highest exhaust speeds, energetic efficiency and
thrust are all inversely proportional to exhaust velocity. Their very high
exhaust velocity means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with
practical power sources provide low thrust, but use hardly any fuel.
For some missions, particularly reasonably close to the Sun, solar_energy may
be sufficient, and has very often been used, but for others further out or at
higher power, nuclear energy is necessary; engines drawing their power from a
nuclear source are called nuclear_electric_rockets.
With any current source of electrical power, chemical, nuclear or solar, the
maximum amount of power that can be generated limits the amount of thrust that
can be produced to a small value. Power generation adds significant mass to the
spacecraft, and ultimately the weight of the power source limits the
performance of the vehicle.
Current nuclear power generators are approximately half the weight of solar
panels per watt of energy supplied, at terrestrial distances from the Sun.
Chemical power generators are not used due to the far lower total available
energy. Beamed power to the spacecraft shows some potential.

          o Hall_effect_thruster
          o Colloid_thruster
    * Electrothermal thrusters (electromagnetic fields are used to generate a
      plasma to increase the heat of the bulk propellant, the thermal energy
      imparted to the propellant gas is then converted into kinetic energy by a
      nozzle of either physical material construction or by magnetic means)
          o DC_arcjet
          o microwave_arcjet
          o Helicon_Double_Layer_Thruster
    * Electromagnetic thrusters (ions are accelerated either by the Lorentz
      Force or by the effect of electromagnetic fields where the electric field
      is not in the direction of the acceleration)

accelerated simultaneously, no neutralizer is required.
**** Without internal reaction mass[edit] ****
NASA study of a solar sail. The sail would be half a kilometer wide.
The law_of_conservation of momentum is usually taken to imply that any engine
which uses no reaction mass cannot accelerate the center of mass of a spaceship
(changing orientation, on the other hand, is possible). But space is not empty,
especially space inside the Solar System; there are gravitation fields,
magnetic_fields, electromagnetic_waves, solar_wind and solar radiation.
Electromagnetic waves in particular are known to contain momentum, despite
being massless; specifically the momentum flux density P of an EM wave is
quantitatively 1/c^2 times the Poynting_vector S, i.e. P = S/c^2, where c is
the velocity of light. Field_propulsion methods which do not rely on reaction
mass thus must try to take advantage of this fact by coupling to a momentum-
bearing field such as an EM wave that exists in the vicinity of the craft.
However, because many of these phenomena are diffuse in nature, corresponding
propulsion structures need to be proportionately large.[original_research?]
There are several different space drives that need little or no reaction mass
to function. A tether_propulsion system employs a long cable with a high
tensile strength to change a spacecraft's orbit, such as by interaction with a
planet's magnetic field or through momentum exchange with another object.[15]
Solar_sails rely on radiation_pressure from electromagnetic energy, but they
require a large collection surface to function effectively. The magnetic_sail
deflects charged particles from the solar_wind with a magnetic field, thereby
imparting momentum to the spacecraft. A variant is the mini-magnetospheric
plasma_propulsion system, which uses a small cloud of plasma held in a magnetic
field to deflect the Sun's charged particles. An E-sail would use very thin and
lightweight wires holding an electric charge to deflect these particles, and
may have more controllable directionality.
As a proof of concept, NanoSail-D became the first nanosatellite to orbit
Earth.[16][full_citation_needed] There are plans to add them[clarification
needed] to future Earth orbit satellites, enabling them to de-orbit and burn up
once they are no longer needed. Cubesail will be the first mission to
demonstrate solar sailing in low Earth orbit, and the first mission to
demonstrate full three-axis attitude control of a solar sail.[17]
Japan also launched its own solar sail powered spacecraft IKAROS in May 2010.
IKAROS successfully demonstrated propulsion and guidance and is still flying
today.
A satellite or other space vehicle is subject to the law_of_conservation_of
angular_momentum, which constrains a body from a net_change in angular
velocity. Thus, for a vehicle to change its relative_orientation without
expending reaction mass, another part of the vehicle may rotate in the opposite
direction. Non-conservative external forces, primarily gravitational and
atmospheric, can contribute up to several degrees per day to angular momentum,
[18] so secondary systems are designed to "bleed off" undesired rotational
energies built up over time. Accordingly, many spacecraft utilize reaction
wheels or control_moment_gyroscopes to control orientation in space.[19]
A gravitational_slingshot can carry a space_probe onward to other destinations
without the expense of reaction mass. By harnessing the gravitational energy of
other celestial objects, the spacecraft can pick up kinetic energy.[20]
However, even more energy can be obtained from the gravity assist if rockets
are used.
Beam-powered_propulsion is another method of propulsion without reaction mass.
Beamed propulsion includes sails pushed by laser, microwave, or particle beams.
***** Planetary and atmospheric propulsion[edit] *****
A successful proof of concept Lightcraft test, a subset of beam-powered
propulsion.
**** Launch-assist mechanisms[edit] ****
Main article: Space_launch
There have been many ideas proposed for launch-assist mechanisms that have the
potential of drastically reducing the cost of getting into orbit. Proposed non-
rocket_spacelaunch launch-assist mechanisms include:
    * Skyhook (requires reusable suborbital launch vehicle, not engineeringly
      feasible using presently available materials)
    * Space_elevator (tether from Earth's surface to geostationary orbit,
      cannot be built with existing materials)
    * Launch_loop (a very fast enclosed rotating loop about 80 km tall)
    * Space_fountain (a very tall building held up by a stream of masses fired
      from its base)
    * Orbital_ring (a ring around Earth with spokes hanging down off bearings)
    * Electromagnetic_catapult (railgun, coilgun) (an electric gun)
    * Rocket_sled_launch
    * Space_gun (Project_HARP, ram_accelerator) (a chemically powered gun)
    * Beam-powered_propulsion rockets and jets powered from the ground via a
      beam
    * High-altitude_platforms to assist initial stage
**** Air-breathing engines[edit] ****
Main articles: Jet_engine and Air-breathing_electric_propulsion
Studies generally show that conventional air-breathing engines, such as ramjets
or turbojets are basically too heavy (have too low a thrust/weight ratio) to
give any significant performance improvement when installed on a launch vehicle
itself. However, launch vehicles can be air_launched from separate lift
vehicles (e.g. B-29, Pegasus_Rocket and White_Knight) which do use such
propulsion systems. Jet engines mounted on a launch rail could also be so used.
On the other hand, very lightweight or very high speed engines have been
proposed that take advantage of the air during ascent:
    * SABRE - a lightweight hydrogen fuelled turbojet with precooler[21]
    * ATREX - a lightweight hydrogen fuelled turbojet with precooler[22]
    * Liquid_air_cycle_engine - a hydrogen fuelled jet engine that liquifies
      the air before burning it in a rocket engine
    * Scramjet - jet engines that use supersonic combustion
    * Shcramjet - similar to a scramjet engine, however it takes advantage of
      shockwaves produced from the aircraft in the combustion chamber to assist
      in increasing overall efficiency.
Normal rocket launch vehicles fly almost vertically before rolling over at an
altitude of some tens of kilometers before burning sideways for orbit; this
initial vertical climb wastes propellant but is optimal as it greatly reduces
airdrag. Airbreathing engines burn propellant much more efficiently and this
would permit a far flatter launch trajectory, the vehicles would typically fly
approximately tangentially to Earth's surface until leaving the atmosphere then
perform a rocket burn to bridge the final delta-v to orbital velocity.
For spacecraft already in very low-orbit, air-breathing_electric_propulsion
would use residual gases in the upper atmosphere as propellant. Air-breathing
electric propulsion could make a new class of long-lived, low-orbiting missions
feasible on Earth, Mars or Venus.[23][24]
**** Planetary arrival and landing[edit] ****
A test version of the MARS Pathfinder airbag system
When a vehicle is to enter orbit around its destination planet, or when it is
to land, it must adjust its velocity. This can be done using all the methods
listed above (provided they can generate a high enough thrust), but there are a
few methods that can take advantage of planetary atmospheres and/or surfaces.
    * Aerobraking allows a spacecraft to reduce the high point of an elliptical
      orbit by repeated brushes with the atmosphere at the low point of the
      orbit. This can save a considerable amount of fuel because it takes much
      less delta-V to enter an elliptical orbit compared to a low circular
      orbit. Because the braking is done over the course of many orbits,
      heating is comparatively minor, and a heat shield is not required. This
      has been done on several Mars missions such as Mars_Global_Surveyor, Mars
      Odyssey and Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter, and at least one Venus mission,
      Magellan.
    * Aerocapture is a much more aggressive manoeuver, converting an incoming
      hyperbolic orbit to an elliptical orbit in one pass. This requires a heat
      shield and much trickier navigation, because it must be completed in one
      pass through the atmosphere, and unlike aerobraking no preview of the
      atmosphere is possible. If the intent is to remain in orbit, then at
      least one more propulsive maneuver is required after
      aerocaptureâotherwise the low point of the resulting orbit will remain
      in the atmosphere, resulting in eventual re-entry. Aerocapture has not
      yet been tried on a planetary mission, but the re-entry_skip by Zond_6
      and Zond_7 upon lunar return were aerocapture maneuvers, because they
      turned a hyperbolic orbit into an elliptical orbit. On these missions,
      because there was no attempt to raise the perigee after the aerocapture,
      the resulting orbit still intersected the atmosphere, and re-entry
      occurred at the next perigee.
    * A ballute is an inflatable drag device.
    * Parachutes can land a probe on a planet or moon with an atmosphere,
      usually after the atmosphere has scrubbed off most of the velocity, using
      a heat_shield.
    * Airbags can soften the final landing.
    * Lithobraking, or stopping by impacting the surface, is usually done by
      accident. However, it may be done deliberately with the probe expected to
      survive (see, for example, Deep_Impact_(spacecraft)), in which case very
      sturdy probes are required.
***** Table of methods[edit] *****
Below is a summary of some of the more popular, proven technologies, followed
by increasingly speculative methods.
Four numbers are shown. The first is the effective_exhaust_velocity: the
equivalent speed that the propellant leaves the vehicle. This is not
necessarily the most important characteristic of the propulsion method; thrust
and power consumption and other factors can be. However:
    * if the delta-v is much more than the exhaust velocity, then exorbitant
      amounts of fuel are necessary (see the section on calculations, above)
    * if it is much more than the delta-v, then, proportionally more energy is
      needed; if the power is limited, as with solar energy, this means that
      the journey takes a proportionally longer time
The second and third are the typical amounts of thrust and the typical burn
times of the method. Outside a gravitational potential small amounts of thrust
applied over a long period will give the same effect as large amounts of thrust
over a short period. (This result does not apply when the object is
significantly influenced by gravity.)
The fourth is the maximum delta-v this technique can give (without staging).
For rocket-like propulsion systems this is a function of mass fraction and
exhaust velocity. Mass fraction for rocket-like systems is usually limited by
propulsion system weight and tankage weight. For a system to achieve this
limit, typically the payload may need to be a negligible percentage of the
vehicle, and so the practical limit on some systems can be much lower.

***** Testing[edit] *****
Spacecraft propulsion systems are often first statically tested on Earth's
surface, within the atmosphere but many systems require a vacuum chamber to
test fully. Rockets are usually tested at a rocket_engine_test_facility well
away from habitation and other buildings for safety reasons. Ion_drives are far
less dangerous and require much less stringent safety, usually only a large-ish
vacuum chamber is needed.
Famous static test locations can be found at Rocket_Ground_Test_Facilities
Some systems cannot be adequately tested on the ground and test launches may be
employed at a Rocket_Launch_Site.
***** Speculative methods[edit] *****
Artist's conception of a warp drive design
A variety of hypothetical propulsion techniques have been considered that
require a deeper understanding of the properties of space, particularly
inertial_frames and the vacuum_state. To date, such methods are highly
speculative and include:
    * Black_hole_starship
    * Differential_sail
    * Faster-than-light
    * Field_propulsion
          o RF_resonant_cavity_thruster
    * Gravitational_shielding
          o Diametric drive
          o Disjunction drive
          o Pitch drive
          o Bias drive
    * Photon_rocket
    * Photonic_laser_thruster
    * Quantum_vacuum_thruster
    * Reactionless_drive
          o AbrahamâMinkowski_drive
          o Alcubierre_drive
          o Heim_drive
          o Dean_drive
          o Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster (GIT)
          o Woodward_effect
A NASA assessment of its Breakthrough_Propulsion_Physics_Program divides such
proposals into those that are non-viable for propulsion purposes, those that
are of uncertain potential, and those that are not impossible according to
current theories.[43]

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ With things moving around in orbits and nothing staying still, the
      question may be quite reasonably asked, stationary relative to what? The
      answer is for the energy to be zero (and in the absence of gravity which
      complicates the issue somewhat), the exhaust must stop relative to the
      initial motion of the rocket before the engines were switched on. It is
      possible to do calculations from other reference frames, but
      consideration for the kinetic energy of the exhaust and propellant needs
      to be given. In Newtonian mechanics the initial position of the rocket is
      the centre_of_mass_frame for the rocket/propellant/exhaust, and has the
      minimum energy of any frame.
