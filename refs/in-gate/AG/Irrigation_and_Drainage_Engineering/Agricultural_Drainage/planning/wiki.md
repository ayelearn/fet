Planning is the process of thinking about the activities required to achieve a
desired goal. It is the first and foremost activity to achieve desired results.
It involves the creation and maintenance of a plan, such as psychological
aspects that require conceptual skills. There are even a couple of tests to
measure someoneâs capability of planning well. As such, planning is a
fundamental property of intelligent behavior. An important further meaning,
often just called "planning" is the legal_context_of_permitted_building
developments.
Also, planning has a specific process and is necessary for multiple occupations
(particularly in fields such as management, business, etc.). In each field
there are different types of plans that help companies achieve efficiency and
effectiveness. An important, albeit often ignored aspect of planning, is the
relationship it holds to forecasting. Forecasting can be described as
predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the
future should look like for multiple scenarios. Planning combines forecasting
with preparation of scenarios and how to react to them. Planning is one of the
most important project management and time management techniques. Planning is
preparing a sequence of action steps to achieve some specific goal. If a person
does it effectively, they can reduce much the necessary time and effort of
achieving the goal. A plan is like a map. When following a plan, a person can
see how much they have progressed towards their project goal and how far they
are from their destination.

***** Planning topics[edit] *****
**** Psychological aspects[edit] ****
The Striatum; part of the basal_ganglia; neural pathways between the striatum
and the frontal_lobe have been implicated in planning function.
Planning is one of the executive_functions of the brain, encompassing the
neurological processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of
a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. Various studies
utilizing a combination of neuropsychological, neuropharmacological and
functional neuroimaging approaches have suggested there is a positive
relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the frontal_lobe.
A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the
frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive
planning and associated executive traits such as working_memory.
Disruption of the neural_pathways, via various mechanisms such as traumatic
brain_injury, or the effects of neurodegenerative_diseases between this area of
the frontal cortex and the basal_ganglia specifically the striatum (cortico-
striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning
function.[1]
Individuals who were born Very Low Birth Weight (<1500 grams) and Extremely Low
BirthWeight (ELBW) are at greater risk for various cognitive deficits including
planning ability.[2][3]
**** Neuropsychological tests[edit] ****
[A_version_of_the_Tower_of_Hanoi_utilizing_four_discs.]
Animation of a four disc version of the Tower_of_Hanoi.
There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure
variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.
    * Tower_of_Hanoi (TOH-R), a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French
      mathematician Ãdouard Lucas. There are different variations of the
      puzzle, the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to
      nine discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of
      the problem solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is
      to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
          o Only one disk may be moved at a time.
          o Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods
            and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may
            already be present on that rod.
          o No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.[4][5]

    * Tower_of_London (TOL) is another test that was developed in 1992
      (Shallice 1992) specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur
      with damage to the frontal lobe. Test participants with damage to the
      left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater
      number of moves required for solution).
In test participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right
posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment. The results
implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the TOL were
supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in
regional cerebral_blood_flow to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of
moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal
area: i.e. subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater
activation in the left prefrontal area.[6]
**** Planning in public policy[edit] ****
Public policy planning includes environmental, land_use, regional, urban and
spatial_planning. In many countries, the operation of a town and country
planning system is often referred to as "planning" and the professionals which
operate the system are known as "planners".
It is a conscious as well as sub-conscious activity. It is "an anticipatory
decision making process" that helps in coping with complexities. It is deciding
future course of action from amongst alternatives. It is a process that
involves making and evaluating each set of interrelated decisions. It is
selection of missions, objectives and "translation of knowledge into action." A
planned performance brings better results compared to an unplanned one. A
manager's job is planning, monitoring and controlling. Planning and goal
setting are important traits of an organization. It is done at all levels of
the organization. Planning includes the plan, the thought process, action, and
implementation. Planning gives more power over the future. Planning is deciding
in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who should do it. This
bridges the gap from where the organization is to where it wants to be. The
planning function involves establishing goals and arranging them in logical
order. A well planned organization achieve faster goals than the ones that
don't plan before implementation.
***** Planning process[edit] *****
Example of planning process framework.
Patrick Montana and Bruce Charnov outline a three-step result-oriented process
for planning:[7]
   1. choosing a destination
   2. evaluating alternative routes
   3. deciding the specific course of the plan
In organizations, planning can become a management process, concerned with
defining goals for a future direction and determining on the missions and
resources to achieve those targets. To meet the goals, managers may develop
plans such as a business_plan or a marketing_plan. Planning always has a
purpose. The purpose may involve the achievement of certain goals or targets.
Major characteristics of planning in organizations include:
    * Planning increases the efficiency of an organization.
    * Planning reduces risks.
    * Planning utilizes with maximum efficiency the available time and
      resources
The concept of planning in organizations involves identifying what an
organization wants to do by using four questions: "where are we today in terms
of our business or strategy planning? Where are we going? Where do we want to
go? How are we going to get there?..."[citation_needed]

      interest in land development] will be neglected. So the effect is the
      opposite of what is intended: opportunism.
