Water balance
Groundwater recharge or deep drainage or deep percolation is a hydrologic
process, where water moves downward from surface_water to groundwater. Recharge
is the primary method through which water enters an aquifer. This process
usually occurs in the vadose_zone below plant roots and, is often expressed as
a flux to the water_table surface. Groundwater recharge also encompasses water
moving away from the water table farther into the saturated zone.[1] Recharge
occurs both naturally (through the water_cycle) and through anthropogenic
processes (i.e., "artificial groundwater recharge"), where rainwater and or
reclaimed_water is routed to the subsurface.

***** Processes[edit] *****
Groundwater is recharged naturally by rain and snow melt and to a smaller
extent by surface water (rivers and lakes). Recharge may be impeded somewhat by
human activities including paving, development, or logging. These activities
can result in loss of topsoil resulting in reduced water infiltration, enhanced
surface_runoff and reduction in recharge. Use of groundwaters, especially for
irrigation, may also lower the water tables. Groundwater recharge is an
important process for sustainable groundwater management, since the volume-rate
abstracted from an aquifer in the long term should be less than or equal to the
volume-rate that is recharged.
Recharge can help move excess salts that accumulate in the root zone to deeper
soil layers, or into the groundwater system. Tree roots increase water
saturation into groundwater reducing water runoff.[2] Flooding temporarily
increases river_bed permeability by moving clay soils downstream, and this
increases aquifer recharge.[3]
Artificial groundwater recharge is becoming increasingly important in India,
where over-pumping of groundwater by farmers has led to underground resources
becoming depleted. In 2007, on the recommendations of the International_Water
Management_Institute, the Indian government allocated â¹1,800 crore
(equivalent to â¹41 billion or US$590 million in 2018) to fund dug-well
recharge_projects (a dug-well is a wide, shallow well, often lined with
concrete) in 100 districts within seven states where water stored in hard-rock
aquifers had been over-exploited. Another environmental issue is the disposal
of waste through the water flux such as dairy farms, industrial, and urban
runoff.
**** Wetlands[edit] ****
Wetlands help maintain the level of the water table and exert control on the
hydraulic head.[4] This provides force for groundwater recharge and discharge
to other waters as well. The extent of groundwater recharge by a wetland is
dependent upon soil, vegetation, site, perimeter to volume ratio, and water
table gradient.[5] Groundwater recharge occurs through mineral_soils found
primarily around the edges of wetlands.[6] The soil under most wetlands is
relatively impermeable. A high perimeter to volume ratio, such as in small
wetlands, means that the surface area through which water can infiltrate into
the groundwater is high.[7] Groundwater recharge is typical in small wetlands
such as prairie_potholes, which can contribute significantly to recharge of
regional groundwater resources.[7] Researchers have discovered groundwater
recharge of up to 20% of wetland volume per season.[7]
**** Depression-focused recharge[edit] ****
If water falls uniformly over a field such that field_capacity of the soil is
not exceeded, then negligible water percolates to groundwater. If instead water
puddles in low-lying areas, the same water volume concentrated over a smaller
area may exceed field capacity resulting in water that percolates down to
recharge groundwater. The larger the relative contributing runoff area is, the
more focused infiltration is. The recurring process of water that falls
relatively uniformly over an area, flowing to groundwater selectively under
surface depressions is depression focused recharge. Water tables rise under
such depressions.
*** Depression pressure[edit] ***
Depression focused groundwater recharge can be very important in arid_regions.
More rain events are capable of contributing to groundwater supply.
Depression focused groundwater recharge also profoundly effects contaminant
transport into groundwater. This is of great concern in regions with karst
geological formations because water can eventually dissolve tunnels all the way
to aquifers, or otherwise disconnected streams. This extreme form of
preferential flow, accelerates the transport of contaminants and the erosion of
such tunnels. In this way depressions intended to trap runoff waterâbefore it
flows to vulnerable water resourcesâcan connect underground over time.
Cavitation of surfaces above into the tunnels, results in potholes or caves.
Deeper ponding exerts pressure that forces water into the ground faster. Faster
flow dislodges contaminants otherwise adsorbed on soil and carries them along.
This can carry pollution directly to the raised water_table below and into the
groundwater_supply. Thus the quality of water collecting in infiltration_basins
is of special concern.
*** Pollution[edit] ***
Pollution in stormwater runoff collects in retention basins. Concentrating
degradable contaminants can accelerate biodegradation. However, where and when
water tables are high this affects appropriate design of detention_ponds,
retention_ponds and rain_gardens.
***** Estimation methods[edit] *****
Rates of groundwater recharge are difficult to quantify[8] since other related
processes, such as evaporation, transpiration (or evapotranspiration) and
infiltration processes must first be measured or estimated to determine the
balance.
**** Physical[edit] ****
Physical methods use the principles of soil_physics to estimate recharge. The
direct physical methods are those that attempt to actually measure the volume
of water passing below the root zone. Indirect physical methods rely on the
measurement or estimation of soil physical parameters, which along with soil
physical principles, can be used to estimate the potential or actual recharge.
After months without rain the level of the rivers under humid climate is low
and represents solely drained groundwater. Thus, the recharge can be calculated
from this base flow if the catchment area is already known.
**** Chemical[edit] ****
Chemical methods use the presence of relatively inert water-soluble substances,
such as an isotopic_tracer or chloride,[9] moving through the soil, as deep
drainage occurs.
**** Numerical models[edit] ****
Recharge can be estimated using numerical_methods, using such codes as
Hydrologic_Evaluation_of_Landfill_Performance, UNSAT-H, SHAW, WEAP, and MIKE
SHE. The 1D-program HYDRUS1D is available online. The codes generally use
climate and soil data to arrive at a recharge estimate and use the Richards
equation in some form to model groundwater flow in the vadose_zone.
***** Factors affecting groundwater recharge[edit] *****
**** Climate change[edit] ****
Natural Processes of groundwater recharge. Adjustments affecting the water
table will drastically enhance or diminish the quality of groundwater recharge
in a specific region.
The future of climate change introduces the opportunity of implications
regarding the availability of groundwater recharge for future drainage_basin.
Recent Studies explore different results of future groundwater recharge rates
based on theoretical moist, medium, and arid climates. The model projects a
series of various rainfall patterns. From the results, it is predicted that
groundwater recharge rates will have the smallest impact on a climate of equal
humidity and dryness. Research predicts the insignificant impact of groundwater
recharge rates on a medium climate due to predictions of decreased basin size
and rainfall.[10] Precipitation trends are predicted to relay minimal change
quantitatively in the near future, while groundwater recharge rates are subject
to increase as a consequence of global_warming.[10] This phenomenon is
explained through the physical attributes of vegetation. With increasing
temperature as a result of global warming, leaf_area_index (LAI) decreases.
This leads to higher rates of infiltration into the soil and less interception
within the tree itself. A direct result of increasing infiltration into the
soil is elevated rates of groundwater recharge.[10] Therefore, with increasing
temperatures and insignificant changes of precipitation patterns, groundwater
recharge rates are subject to increase.
Other research initiatives also reveal that different mechanisms of groundwater
recharge have different sensitivities in response to climate change. Increasing
global temperatures generate more arid climates in some regions, and this can
lead to excessive pumping of the water_table. When rates of pumping are greater
than the rate of groundwater recharge, there is an enhanced risk of
overdrafting.[11] The depletion of groundwater is evidence of the water table's
response to excessive pumping. Severe consequences of groundwater depletion
include lowering of the water table and depleting water quality.[11] The
quantity of water in the water table can change rapidly depending on the rate
of extraction. As the level of water decreases in the aquifer, there is less
available water to be pumped. If the rate of potential groundwater recharge is
less than the rate of extraction, the water table will be too low for access. A
consequence of this includes drilling deeper into the water table to access
more water. Drilling into the aquifer can be a costly endeavour and it is not
guaranteed that the quantity of available water will be exact to previous
yields.[11]
**** Urbanization[edit] ****
Further implications of groundwater recharge are a consequence of urbanization.
Research shows that the recharge rate can be up to ten times higher [12] in
urban areas compared to rural regions. This is explained through the vast water
supply and sewage networks supported in urban regions in which rural areas are
not likely to obtain. Recharge in rural areas is heavily supported by
precipitation [12] and this is opposite for urban areas. Road networks and
infrastructure within cities prevents surface water from percolating into the
soil, resulting in most surface runoff entering storm drains for local water
supply. As urban development continues to spread across various regions, rates
of groundwater recharge will increase relative to the existing rates of the
previous rural region. A consequence of sudden influxes in groundwater recharge
includes flash_flooding.[13] The ecosystem will have to adjust to the elevated
groundwater surplus due to groundwater recharge rates. Additionally, road
networks have less permeable compared to soil, resulting in higher amounts of
surface runoff . Therefore, urbanization increases the rate of groundwater
recharge and reduces infiltration,[13] resulting in flash floods as the local
ecosystem accommodates changes to the surrounding environment.
