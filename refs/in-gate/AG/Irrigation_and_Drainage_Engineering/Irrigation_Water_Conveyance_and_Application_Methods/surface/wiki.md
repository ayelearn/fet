The surface of an apple has various perceptible characteristics, such as
curvature, smoothness, texture, color, and shininess; observing these
characteristics by sight or touch allows the object to be identified.

The Sun, like all stars, appears from a distance to have a distinct surface,
but on closer approach has no set surface,
A surface, as the term is most generally used, is the outermost or uppermost
layer of a physical object or space.[1][2] It is the portion or region of the
object that can first be perceived by an observer using the senses of sight and
touch, and is the portion with which other materials first interact. The
surface of an object is more than "a mere geometric solid", but is "filled
with, spread over by, or suffused with perceivable qualities such as color and
warmth".[3]
The concept of surface has been abstracted and formalized in mathematics,
specifically in geometry. Depending on the properties on which the emphasis is
given, there are several non equivalent such formalizations, that are all
called surface, sometimes with some qualifier, such as algebraic_surface,
smooth_surface or fractal_surface.
The concept of surface and its mathematical abstraction are both widely used in
physics, engineering, computer_graphics, and many other disciplines, primarily
in representing the surfaces of physical objects. For example, in analyzing the
aerodynamic properties of an airplane, the central consideration is the flow of
air along its surface. The concept also raises certain philosophical
questionsâfor example, how thick is the layer of atoms or molecules that can
be considered part of the surface of an object (i.e., where does the "surface"
end and the "interior" begin),[2][4] and do objects really have a surface at
all if, at the subatomic level, they never actually come in contact with other
objects.[5]

***** Perception of surfaces[edit] *****
The surface of an object is the part of the object that is primarily perceived.
Humans equate seeing the surface of an object with seeing an object. For
example, in looking at an automobile, it is normally not possible to see the
engine, electronics, and other internal structures, but the object is still
recognized as an automobile because the surface identifies it as one.[6]
Conceptually, the "surface" of an object can be defined as the topmost layer of
atoms.[7] Many objects and organisms have a surface that is in some way
distinct from their interior. For example, the peel of an apple has very
different qualities from the interior of the apple,[8] and the exterior surface
of a radio may have very different components from the interior. Peeling the
apple constitutes removal of the surface, ultimately leaving a different
surface with a different texture and appearance, identifiable as a peeled
apple. Removing the exterior surface of an electronic device may render its
purpose unrecognizable. By contrast, removing the outermost layer of a rock or
the topmost layer of liquid contained in a glass would leave a substance or
material with the same composition, only slightly reduced in volume.
***** In mathematics[edit] *****
Main article: Surface_(mathematics)
In mathematics, a surface is, generally speaking, an object similar to a plane
but that need not be flat. Thus, a surface is a generalization of a plane, in
that curvature is not necessarily zero. This is analogous to a curve
generalizing a (straight) line.
There are several more precise definitions, depending on the context and the
mathematical tools that are used for the study. The simplest mathematical
surfaces are planes and spheres in the Euclidean_3-space. The exact definition
of a surface may depend on the context. Typically, in algebraic_geometry, a
surface may cross itself (and may have other singularities), while, in topology
and differential_geometry, it may not.
A surface is a two-dimensional_space; this means that a moving point on a
surface may move in two directions (it has two degrees_of_freedom). In other
words, around almost every point, there is a coordinate_patch on which a two-
dimensional coordinate_system is defined. For example, the surface of the Earth
resembles (ideally) a two-dimensional sphere, and latitude and longitude
provide two-dimensional coordinates on it (except at the poles and along the
180th_meridian).

Many surfaces considered in physics and chemistry (physical_sciences in
general) are interfaces. For example, a surface may be the idealized limit
between two fluids (the surface of the sea) or the idealized boundary of a
solid (the surface of a ball). In fluid_dynamics, the shape of a surface may be
defined by surface_tension. However, they are surfaces only at macroscopic
scale. At microscopic_scale, they may have some thickness. At atomic_scale,
they do not look at all as a surface, because of holes formed by spaces between
atoms or molecules.
Other surfaces considered in physics are wavefronts. One of these, discovered
by Fresnel, is called wave_surface by mathematicians.
The surface of the reflector of a telescope is a paraboloid_of_revolution.

One of the main challenges in computer graphics is creating realistic
simulations of surfaces. In technical applications of 3D_computer_graphics
(CAx) such as computer-aided_design and computer-aided_manufacturing, surfaces
are one way of representing objects. The other ways are wireframe (lines and
curves) and solids. Point clouds are also sometimes used as temporary ways to
represent an object, with the goal of using the points to create one or more of
the three permanent representations.
