****** Irrigation scheduling ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Irrigation scheduling is the process used by irrigation system managers to
determine the correct frequency and duration of watering.
The following factors may be taken into consideration:
    * Precipitation rate of the irrigation equipment â how quickly the water
      is applied, often expressed in inches or mm per hour.
    * Distribution_uniformity of the irrigation system â how uniformly the
      water is applied, expressed as a percentage, the higher the number, the
      more uniform.
    * Soil_infiltration_rate â how quickly the water is absorbed by the soil,
      the rate of which also decreases as the soil becomes wetter, also often
      expressed in inches or mm per hour.
    * Slope (topography) of the land being irrigated as this affects how
      quickly runoff occurs, often expressed as a percentage, i.e. distance of
      fall divided by 100 units of horizontal distance (1 ft of fall per 100 ft
      (30 m) would be 1%).
    * Soil available_water_capacity, expressed in units of water per unit of
      soil, i.e. inches of water per foot of soil.
    * Effective rooting depth of the plants to be watered, which affects how
      much water can be stored in the soil and made available to the plants.
    * Current watering requirements of the plant (which may be estimated by
      calculating evapotranspiration, or ET), often expressed in inches per
      day.
    * Amount of time in which water or labor may be available for irrigation.
    * Amount of allowable moisture_stress which may be placed on the plant. For
      high value vegetable crops, this may mean no allowable stress, while for
      a lawn some stress would be allowable, since the goal would not be to
      maximize production, but merely to keep the lawn green and healthy.
    * Timing to take advantage of projected rainfall
    * Timing to take advantage of favorable utility rates
    * Timing to avoid interfering with other activities such as sporting
      events, holidays, lawn maintenance, or crop harvesting.
The goal in irrigation scheduling is to apply enough water to fully wet the
plant's root zone while minimizing overwatering and then allow the soil to dry
out in between waterings, to allow air to enter the soil and encourage root
development, but not so much that the plant is stressed beyond what is
allowable.
In recent years, more sophisticated irrigation controllers have been developed
that receive ET input from either a single on-site weather station or from a
network of stations and automatically adjust the irrigation schedule
accordingly.
Other devices helpful in irrigation scheduling are rain_sensors, which
automatically shut off an irrigation system when it rains, and soil moisture
sensing devices such as capacitance sensors, tensiometers and gypsum blocks.
