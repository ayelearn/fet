Efficiency is the (often measurable) ability to avoid wasting materials,
energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired
result. In a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well,
successfully, and without waste.[1][2][3][4][5] In more mathematical or
scientific terms, it is a measure of the extent to which input is well used for
an intended task or function (output). It often specifically comprises the
capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome
with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.[6]
Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and
industries.
Efficiency is very often confused with effectiveness. In general, efficiency is
a measurable concept, quantitatively determined by the ratio of useful output
to total input. Effectiveness is the simpler concept of being able to achieve a
desired result, which can be expressed quantitatively but does not usually
require more complicated mathematics than addition. Efficiency can often be
expressed as a percentage of the result that could ideally be expected, for
example if no energy were lost due to friction or other causes, in which case
100% of fuel or other input would be used to produce the desired result. In
some cases efficiency can be indirectly quantified with a non-percentage value,
e.g. specific_impulse.
A common but confusing way of distinguishing between efficiency and
effectiveness is the saying "Efficiency is doing things right, while
effectiveness is doing the right things." This saying indirectly emphasizes
that the selection of objectives of a production process is just as important
as the quality of that process. This saying popular in business however
obscures the more common sense of "effectiveness", which would/should produce
the following mnemonic: "Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is
getting things done." This makes it clear that effectiveness, for example large
production numbers, can also be achieved through inefficient processes if, for
example, workers are willing or used to working longer hours or with greater
physical effort than in other companies or countries or if they can be forced
to do so. Similarly, a company can achieve effectiveness, for example large
production numbers, through inefficient processes if it can afford to use more
energy per product, for example if energy prices or labor costs or both are
lower than for its competitors.
Efficiency is often measured as the ratio of useful output to total input,
which can be expressed with the mathematical formula r=P/C, where P is the
amount of useful output ("product") produced per the amount C ("cost") of
resources consumed. This may correspond to a percentage if products and
consumables are quantified in compatible units, and if consumables are
transformed into products via a conservative process. For example, in the
analysis of the energy_conversion_efficiency of heat_engines in thermodynamics,
the product P may be the amount of useful work output, while the consumable C
is the amount of high-temperature heat input. Due to the conservation_of
energy, P can never be greater than C, and so the efficiency r is never greater
than 100% (and in fact must be even less at finite temperatures).
