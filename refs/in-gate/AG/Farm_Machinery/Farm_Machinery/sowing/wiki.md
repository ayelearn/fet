Sowing is the process of planting. An area or object that has had seeds planted
in it will be described as being sowed.

***** Plants which are usually sown[edit] *****
Among the major field crops, oats, wheat, and rye are sown, grasses and legumes
are seeded and maize and soybeans are planted. In planting, wider rows
(generally 75  cm (30  in) or more) are used, and the intent is to have
precise; even spacing between individual seeds in the row, various mechanisms
have been devised to count out individual seeds at exact intervals.
**** Depth of sowing[edit] ****

In sowing, little if any soil is placed over the seeds, as seeds can be
generally sown into the soil by maintaining a planting depth of about 2-3 times
the size of the seed.
**** Sowing types and patterns[edit] ****
For hand sowing, several sowing types exist; these include:[1]
    * Flat sowing
    * Ridge sowing
    * Wide bed sowing
Several patterns for sowing may be used together with these types; these
include:
    * Regular rows
    * Rows that are indented at the even rows (so that the seeds are
    * Symmetrical grid pattern â using the pattern described in The_Garden_of
      Cyrus placed in a crossed pattern). This method is much better, as more
      light may fall on the seedlings as they come out.
***** Types of sowing[edit] *****
**** Hand sowing[edit] ****
Hand sowing or (planting) is the process of casting handfuls of seed over
prepared ground, or broadcasting (from which the technological_term is derived
[citation_needed]). Usually, a drag or harrow is employed to incorporate the
seed into the soil. Though labor-intensive for any but small areas, this method
is still used in some situations. Practice is required to sow evenly and at the
desired rate. A hand seeder can be used for sowing, though it is less of a help
than it is for the smaller seeds of grasses and legumes.
A tray used in horticulture (for sowing and taking plant cuttings)
Hand sowing may be combined with pre-sowing in seed_trays. This allows the
plants to come to strength indoors during cold periods (e.g. spring in
temperate countries).
In agriculture, most seed is now sown using a seed_drill, which offers greater
precision; seed is sown evenly and at the desired rate. The drill also places
the seed at a measured distance below the soil, so that less seed is required.
The standard design uses a fluted feed metering system, which is volumetric in
nature; individual seeds are not counted. Rows are typically about 10â30 cm
apart, depending on the crop species and growing conditions. Several row opener
types are used depending on soil_type and local tradition. Grain drills are
most often drawn by tractors, but can also be pulled by horses. Pickup_trucks
are sometimes used, since little draft is required.
A seed rate of about 100 kg of seed per hectare (2 bushels per acre) is
typical, though rates vary considerably depending on crop species, soil
conditions, and farmer's preference. Excessive rates can cause the crop to
lodge, while too thin a rate will result in poor utilisation of the land,
competition with weeds and a reduction in the yield.
**** Open field[edit] ****
Main article: Open_field_system
Open-field planting refers to the form of sowing used historically in the
agricultural context whereby fields are prepared generically and left open, as
the name suggests, before being sown directly with seed. The seed is frequently
left uncovered at the surface of the soil before germinating and therefore
exposed to the prevailing climate and conditions like storms etc. This is in
contrast to the seedbed method used more commonly in domestic gardening or more
specific (modern) agricultural scenarios where the seed is applied beneath the
soil surface and monitored and manually tended frequently to ensure more
successful growth rates and better yields.
**** Pre-treatment of seed and soil before sowing[edit] ****
Tropical fruit such as avocado also benefit from special seed treatments
(specifically invented for that particular tropical fruit)
Before sowing, certain seeds first require a treatment prior to the sowing
process. This treatment may be seed scarification, stratification, seed soaking
or seed cleaning with cold (or medium hot) water.
Seed soaking is generally done by placing seeds in medium hot water for at
least 24 to up to 48 hours[2] Seed cleaning is done especially with fruit, as
the flesh of the fruit around the seed can quickly become prone to attack from
insects or plagues.[3] Seed washing is generally done by submerging cleansed
seeds 20 minutes in 50 degree_Celsius water.[4] This (rather hot than
moderately hot) water kills any organisms that may have survived on the skin of
a seed. Especially with easily infected tropical_fruit such as lychees and
rambutans, seed washing with high-temperature water is vital.
In addition to the mentioned seed pretreatments, seed_germination is also
assisted when a disease-free soil is used. Especially when trying to germinate
difficult seed (e.g. certain tropical fruit), prior treatment of the soil
(along with the usage of the most suitable soil; e.g. potting_soil, prepared
soil or other substrates) is vital. The two most used soil treatments are
pasteurisation and sterilisation. Depending on the necessity, pasteurisation is
to be preferred as this does not kill all organisms. Sterilisation can be done
when trying to grow truly difficult crops. To pasteurise the soil, the soil is
heated for 15 minutes in an oven of 120 Â°C.[4]
