Fuel efficiency is a form of thermal_efficiency, meaning the ratio from effort
to result of a process that converts chemical potential_energy contained in a
carrier (fuel) into kinetic_energy or work. Overall fuel efficiency may vary
per device, which in turn may vary per application fuel efficiency, especially
fossil_fuel_power_plants or industries dealing with combustion, such as ammonia
production during the Haber_process.
In the context of transport, fuel economy is the energy_efficiency of a
particular vehicle, given as a ratio of distance traveled per unit of fuel
consumed. It is dependent on engine_efficiency, transmission design, and tire
design. Fuel economy is expressed in miles per gallon (mpg) in the USA and
usually also in the UK (imperial gallon); there is sometimes confusion as the
imperial gallon is 20% larger than the US gallon so that mpg values are not
directly comparable. In countries using the metric_system fuel economy is
stated as "fuel consumption" in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km). Litres
per mil are used in Norway and Sweden.
Fuel consumption is a more accurate measure of a vehicleâs performance
because it is a linear relationship while fuel economy leads to distortions in
efficiency improvements.[1]
Weight-specific efficiency (efficiency per unit weight) may be stated for
freight, and passenger-specific efficiency (vehicle efficiency per passenger).

***** Vehicle design[edit] *****
Fuel efficiency is dependent on many parameters of a vehicle, including its
engine parameters, aerodynamic_drag, weight, AC usage, fuel and rolling
resistance. There have been advances in all areas of vehicle design in recent
decades. Fuel efficiency of vehicles can also be improved by careful
maintenance and driving habits.[2]
Hybrid_vehicles use two or more power sources for propulsion. In many designs,
a small combustion engine is combined with electric motors. Kinetic energy
which would otherwise be lost to heat during braking is recaptured as
electrical power to improve fuel efficiency. Engines automatically shut off
when vehicles come to a stop and start again when the accelerator is pressed
preventing wasted energy from idling.[3]
***** Fleet efficiency[edit] *****
Fleet efficiency describes the average efficiency of a population of vehicles.
Technological advances in efficiency may be offset by a change in buying habits
with a propensity to heavier vehicles, which are less efficient, all else being
equal.
***** Energy efficiency terminology[edit] *****
Energy_efficiency is similar to fuel efficiency but the input is usually in
units of energy such as British_thermal_units (BTU), megajoules (MJ),
gigajoules (GJ), kilocalories (kcal), or kilowatt-hours (kWÂ·h). The inverse of
"energy efficiency" is "energy intensity", or the amount of input energy
required for a unit of output such as MJ/passenger-km (of passenger transport),
BTU/ton-mile or kJ/t-km (of freight transport), GJ/t (for production of steel
and other materials), BTU/(kWÂ·h) (for electricity generation), or litres/
100 km (of vehicle travel). Litres per 100 km is also a measure of "energy
intensity" where the input is measured by the amount of fuel and the output is
measured by the distance travelled. For example: Fuel_economy_in_automobiles.
Given a heat value of a fuel, it would be trivial to convert from fuel units
(such as litres of gasoline) to energy units (such as MJ) and conversely. But
there are two problems with comparisons made using energy units:
    * There are two different heat values for any hydrogen-containing fuel
      which can differ by several percent (see below).
    * When comparing transportation energy costs, it must be remembered that a
      kilowatt_hour of electric energy may require an amount of fuel with
      heating value of 2 or 3 kilowatt hours to produce it.
***** Energy content of fuel[edit] *****

The specific energy content of a fuel is the heat energy obtained when a
certain quantity is burned (such as a gallon, litre, kilogram). It is sometimes
called the heat_of_combustion. There exists two different values of specific
heat energy for the same batch of fuel. One is the high (or gross) heat of
combustion and the other is the low (or net) heat of combustion. The high value
is obtained when, after the combustion, the water in the exhaust is in liquid
form. For the low value, the exhaust has all the water in vapor form (steam).
Since water vapor gives up heat energy when it changes from vapor to liquid,
the liquid water value is larger since it includes the latent heat of
vaporization of water. The difference between the high and low values is
significant, about 8 or 9%. This accounts for most of the apparent discrepancy
in the heat value of gasoline. In the U.S. (and the table) the high heat values
have traditionally been used, but in many other countries, the low heat values
are commonly used.

Neither the gross heat of combustion nor the net heat of combustion gives the
theoretical amount of mechanical energy (work) that can be obtained from the
reaction. (This is given by the change in Gibbs_free_energy, and is around
45.7 MJ/kg for gasoline.) The actual amount of mechanical work obtained from
fuel (the inverse of the specific_fuel_consumption) depends on the engine. A
figure of 17.6 MJ/kg is possible with a gasoline engine, and 19.1 MJ/kg for a
diesel engine. See Brake_specific_fuel_consumption for more information.

***** Fuel efficiency of motor vehicles[edit] *****
See also: Fuel_economy_in_automobiles
The fuel efficiency of motor vehicles can be expressed in more ways:
    * Fuel consumption is the amount of fuel used per unit distance; for
      example, litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km). In this case, the lower
      the value, the more economic a vehicle is (the less fuel it needs to
      travel a certain distance); this is the measure generally used across
      Europe (except the UK, Denmark and The Netherlands - see below), New
      Zealand, Australia and Canada. Also in Uruguay, Paraguay, Guatemala,
      Colombia, China, and Madagascar.[citation_needed], as also in post-Soviet
      space.
    * Fuel economy is the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel used; for
      example, kilometres per litre (km/L) or miles per gallon (MPG), where 1
      MPG (imperial) â 0.354006 km/L. In this case, the higher the value, the
      more economic a vehicle is (the more distance it can travel with a
      certain volume of fuel). This measure is popular in the USA and the UK
      (mpg), but in Europe, India, Japan, South Korea and Latin America the
      metric unit km/L is used instead.
Converting from mpg or to L/100 km (or vice versa) involves the use of the
reciprocal function, which is not distributive. Therefore, the average of two
fuel economy numbers gives different values if those units are used, because
one of the functions is reciprocal, thus not linear. If two people calculate
the fuel economy average of two groups of cars with different units, the group
with better fuel economy may be one or the other. However, from the point of
energy used as a shared method of measure, the result shall be the same in both
the cases.[clarification_needed]
The formula for converting to miles per US gallon (exactly 3.785411784 L) from
L/100 km is        235.215 x      {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {235.215}
{x}}}  [\textstyle {\frac  {235.215}{x}}], where     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x]
is value of L/100 km. For miles per Imperial gallon (exactly 4.54609 L) the
formula is        282.481 x      {\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {282.481}
{x}}}  [\textstyle {\frac  {282.481}{x}}].
In parts of Europe, the two standard measuring cycles for "litre/100 km" value
are "urban" traffic with speeds up to 50 km/h from a cold start, and then
"extra urban" travel at various speeds up to 120 km/h which follows the urban
test. A combined figure is also quoted showing the total fuel consumed in
divided by the total distance traveled in both tests. A reasonably modern
European supermini and many mid-size cars, including station wagons, may manage
motorway travel at 5 L/100 km (47 mpg US/56 mpg imp) or 6.5 L/100 km in city
traffic (36 mpg US/43 mpg imp), with carbon_dioxide emissions of around 140 g/
km.
An average North_American mid-size_car travels 21 mpg (US) (11 L/100 km) city,
27 mpg (US) (9 L/100 km) highway; a full-size SUV usually travels 13 mpg (US)
(18 L/100 km) city and 16 mpg (US) (15 L/100 km) highway. Pickup_trucks vary
considerably; whereas a 4 cylinder-engined light pickup can achieve 28 mpg (8
L/100 km), a V8 full-size pickup with extended cabin only travels 13 mpg (US)
(18 L/100 km) city and 15 mpg (US) (15 L/100 km) highway.
The average fuel economy for all vehicles on the road is higher in Europe than
the USA because the higher cost of fuel changes consumer behaviour. In the UK,
a gallon of gas without tax would cost US$1.97, but with taxes cost US$6.06 in
2005. The average cost in the United States was US$2.61. Consumers prefer
"muscle cars", but choose more fuel efficient ones when gas prices increase.[5]
European-built cars are generally more fuel-efficient than US vehicles. While
Europe has many higher efficiency diesel cars, European gasoline vehicles are
on average also more efficient than gasoline-powered vehicles in the USA. Most
European vehicles cited in the CSI study run on diesel engines, which tend to
achieve greater fuel efficiency than gas engines. Selling those cars in the
United States is difficult because of emission standards, notes Walter McManus,
a fuel economy expert at the University of Michigan Transportation Research
Institute. "For the most part, European diesels donât meet U.S. emission
standards", McManus said in 2007. Another reason why many European models are
not marketed in the United States is that labor unions object to having the big
3 import any new foreign built models regardless of fuel economy while laying
off workers at home.[6]
An example of European cars' capabilities of fuel economy is the microcar Smart
Fortwo cdi, which can achieve up to 3.4 l/100 km (69.2 mpg US) using a
turbocharged three-cylinder 41 bhp (30 kW) Diesel engine. The Fortwo is
produced by Daimler_AG and is only sold by one company in the United States.
Furthermore, the world record in fuel economy of production cars is held by the
Volkswagen_Group, with special production models (labeled "3L") of the
Volkswagen_Lupo and the Audi_A2, consuming as little as 3 L/100 km (94 mpg‑imp;
78 mpg‑US).[7][clarification_needed]
Diesel_engines generally achieve greater fuel efficiency than petrol (gasoline)
engines. Passenger car diesel engines have energy_efficiency of up to 41% but
more typically 30%, and petrol engines of up to 37.3%, but more typically 20%.
That is one of the reasons why diesels have better fuel efficiency than
equivalent petrol cars. A common margin is 25% more miles per gallon for an
efficient turbodiesel.
For example, the current model Skoda Octavia, using Volkswagen engines, has a
combined European fuel efficiency of 41.3 mpg for the 105 bhp (78 kW) petrol
engine and 52.3 mpg for the 105 bhp (78 kW) â and heavier â diesel engine.
The higher compression ratio is helpful in raising the energy efficiency, but
diesel fuel also contains approximately 10% more energy per unit volume than
gasoline which contributes to the reduced fuel consumption for a given power
output.
In 2002, the United States had 85,174,776 trucks, and averaged 13.5 miles per
US gallon (17.4 L/100 km; 16.2 mpg‑imp). Large trucks, over 33,000 pounds
(15,000 kg), averaged 5.7 miles per US gallon (41 L/100 km; 6.8 mpg‑imp).[8]

The average economy of automobiles in the United States in 2002 was 22.0 miles
per US gallon (10.7 L/100 km; 26.4 mpg‑imp). By 2010 this had increased to 23.0
miles per US gallon (10.2 L/100 km; 27.6 mpg‑imp). Average fuel economy in the
United States gradually declined until 1973, when it reached a low of 13.4
miles per US gallon (17.6 L/100 km; 16.1 mpg‑imp) and gradually has increased
since, as a result of higher fuel cost.[9] A study indicates that a 10%
increase in gas prices will eventually produce a 2.04% increase in fuel
economy.[10] One method by car makers to increase fuel efficiency is
lightweighting in which lighter-weight materials are substituted in for
improved engine performance and handling.[11]
***** Fuel efficiency in microgravity[edit] *****
How fuel combusts affects how much energy is produced. The National_Aeronautics
and_Space_Administration (NASA) has investigated fuel consumption in
microgravity.
The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on
convection, because soot tends to rise to the top of a flame, such as in a
candle, making the flame yellow. In microgravity or zero_gravity, such as an
environment in outer_space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes
spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient. There are
several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely one
given is the hypothesis that the temperature is evenly distributed enough that
soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs., National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, April 2005. Experiments by NASA in microgravity reveal
that diffusion_flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidised
after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of
mechanisms that behaved differently in microgravity when compared to normal
gravity conditions.LSP-1_experiment_results, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, April 2005. Premixed_flames in microgravity burn at a much
slower rate and more efficiently than even a candle on Earth, and last much
longer.[12]
***** Transportation[edit] *****
**** Fuel efficiency in transportation[edit] ****
Main article: Energy_efficiency_in_transportation
**** Vehicle efficiency and transportation pollution[edit] ****
Main articles: Gas-guzzler and Vehicle_Efficiency_Initiative
Fuel efficiency directly affects emissions causing pollution by affecting the
amount of fuel used. However, it also depends on the fuel source used to drive
the vehicle concerned. Cars for example, can run on a number of fuel types
other than gasoline, such as natural_gas, LPG or biofuel or electricity which
creates various quantities of atmospheric pollution.
A kilogram of carbon, whether contained in petrol, diesel, kerosene, or any
other hydrocarbon fuel in a vehicle, leads to approximately 3.6 kg of CO2
emissions.[13] Due to the carbon content of gasoline, its combustion emits
2.3 kg/l (19.4 lb/US gal) of CO2; since diesel fuel is more energy dense per
unit volume, diesel emits 2.6 kg/l (22.2 lb/US gal).[13] This figure is only
the CO2 emissions of the final fuel product and does not include additional CO2
emissions created during the drilling, pumping, transportation and refining
steps required to produce the fuel. Additional measures to reduce overall
emission includes improvements to the efficiency of air_conditioners, lights
and tires.
**** Driving technique[edit] ****
Main article: Energy-efficient_driving
Many drivers have the potential to improve their fuel efficiency significantly.
[14] These five_basic_fuel-efficient_driving_techniques can be effective.
Simple things such as keeping tires properly inflated, having a vehicle well-
maintained and avoiding idling can dramatically improve fuel efficiency.[15]
There is a growing community of enthusiasts known as hypermilers who develop
and practice driving techniques to increase fuel efficiency and reduce
consumption. Hypermilers have broken records of fuel efficiency, for example,
achieving 109 miles per gallon in a Prius. In non-hybrid vehicles these
techniques are also beneficial, with fuel efficiencies of up to 59 MPG in a
Honda_Accord or 30 MPG in an Acura_MDX.[16]
***** Advanced technology improvements to improve fuel efficiency[edit] *****
The most efficient machines for converting energy to rotary motion are electric
motors, as used in electric_vehicles. However, electricity is not a primary
energy source so the efficiency of the electricity production has also to be
taken into account. Railway trains can be powered using electricity, delivered
through an additional running rail, overhead catenary system or by on-board
generators used in diesel-electric locomotives as common on the US and UK rail
networks. Pollution produced from centralised generation of electricity is
emitted at a distant power station, rather than "on site". Pollution can be
reduced by using more railway electrification and low_carbon_power for
electricity. Some railways, such as the French SNCF and Swiss federal railways
derive most, if not 100% of their power, from hydroelectric or nuclear power
stations, therefore atmospheric pollution from their rail networks is very low.
This was reflected in a study by AEA Technology between a Eurostar train and
airline journeys between London and Paris, which showed the trains on average
emitting 10 times less CO2, per passenger, than planes, helped in part by
French nuclear generation.[17]
**** Hydrogen Fuel Cells[edit] ****
In the future, hydrogen_cars may be commercially available. Toyota is test
marketing hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles in southern California where a
series of hydrogen fueling stations has been established. Powered either
through chemical reactions in a fuel_cell that create electricity to drive very
efficient electrical motors or by directly burning hydrogen in a combustion
engine (near identically to a natural_gas_vehicle, and similarly compatible
with both natural gas and gasoline); these vehicles promise to have near-zero
pollution from the tailpipe (exhaust pipe). Potentially the atmospheric
pollution could be minimal, provided the hydrogen is made by electrolysis using
electricity from non-polluting sources such as solar, wind or hydroelectricity
or nuclear. Commercial hydrogen_production uses fossil fuels and produces more
carbon dioxide than hydrogen.
Because there are pollutants involved in the manufacture and destruction of a
car and the production, transmission and storage of electricity and hydrogen,
the use of the label "zero pollution" should be understood as applying only to
the car's conversion of stored energy into transportation.
In 2004, a consortium of major auto-makers â BMW, General_Motors, Honda,
Toyota and Volkswagen/Audi â came up with "Top Tier Detergent Gasoline
Standard" to gasoline brands in the US and Canada that meet their minimum
standards for detergent content[18] and do not contain metallic additives. Top
Tier gasoline contains higher levels of detergent additives in order to prevent
the build-up of deposits (typically, on fuel_injector and intake_valve) known
