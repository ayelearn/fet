Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological_kingdom
Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume_organic_material, breathe
oxygen, are able_to_move, can reproduce_sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere
of cells, the blastula, during embryonic_development. Over 1.5 million living
animal species have been describedÃ¢Â€Â”of which around 1 million are
insectsÃ¢Â€Â”but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in
total. Animals range in length from 8.5Â millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres
(110Â ft) and have complex_interactions with each other and their environments,
forming intricate food_webs. The category includes humans, but in colloquial
use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals. The study of non-
human animals is known as zoology.
Most living animal species are in the Bilateria, a clade whose members have a
bilaterally_symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomesÃ¢Â€Â”in
which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes, arthropods,
and molluscsÃ¢Â€Â”and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and chordates
(including the vertebrates). Life forms interpreted as early animals were
present in the Ediacaran_biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal
phyla became clearly established in the fossil_record as marine_species during
the Cambrian_explosion which began around 542 million years ago. 6,331 groups
of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have
arisen from a single common_ancestor that lived 650_million_years_ago.
Historically, Aristotle_divided_animals into those with blood and those
without. Carl_Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological_classification
for animals in 1758 with his Systema_Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck
expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst_Haeckel divided the animal
kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous with Animalia) and the
Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern
times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques,
such as molecular_phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the
evolutionary relationships between animal taxa.
Humans make use of many other animal species for food, including meat, milk,
and eggs; for materials, such as leather and wool; as pets; and as working
animals for power and transport. Dogs have been used_in_hunting, while many
terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport. Non-human animals have
appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and
religion.

***** Etymology *****
The word "animal" comes from the Latin animalis, meaning having breath, having
soul or living being.[1] The biological definition includes all members of the
kingdom Animalia.[2] In colloquial usage, as a consequence of anthropocentrism,
the term animal is sometimes used nonscientifically to refer only to non-human
animals.[3][4][5][6]
***** Characteristics *****
Animals are unique in having the ball of cells of the early embryo (1) develop
into a hollow ball or blastula (2).
Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living
things. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular,[7][8] unlike bacteria, which
are prokaryotic, and unlike protists, which are eukaryotic but unicellular.
Unlike plants and algae, which produce_their_own_nutrients[9] animals are
heterotrophic,[8][10] feeding on organic material and digesting it internally.
[11] With very few exceptions, animals respire_aerobically.[12] All animals are
motile[13] (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of
their life_cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and
barnacles, later become sessile. The blastula is a stage in embryonic
development that is unique to most animals,[14] allowing cells_to_be
differentiated into specialised tissues and organs.
**** Structure ****
All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular
matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.[15] During development,
the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon
which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex
structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells,
bones, and spicules.[16] In contrast, the cells of other multicellular
organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls,
and so develop by progressive growth.[17] Animal cells uniquely possess the
cell_junctions called tight_junctions, gap_junctions, and desmosomes.[18]
With few exceptionsÃ¢Â€Â”in particular, the sponges and placozoansÃ¢Â€Â”animal bodies
are differentiated into tissues.[19] These include muscles, which enable
locomotion, and nerve_tissues, which transmit signals and coordinate the body.
Typically, there is also an internal digestive chamber with either one opening
(in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and flatworms) or two openings (in most bilaterians).
[20]
**** Reproduction and development ****
See also: Sexual_reproduction_Ã‚Â§Â Animals, and Asexual_reproduction_Ã‚Â§Â Examples
in_animals
Sexual_reproduction is nearly universal in animals, such as these dragonflies.
Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.[21] They
produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa
and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova.[22] These fuse to form zygotes,[23]
which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges,
blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into
a new sponge.[24] In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated
rearrangement.[25] It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive
chamber and two separate germ_layers, an external ectoderm and an internal
endoderm.[26] In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops
between them.[27] These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and
organs.[28]
Repeated instances of mating_with_a_close_relative during sexual reproduction
generally leads to inbreeding_depression within a population due to the
increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits.[29][30] Animals have evolved
numerous mechanisms for avoiding_close_inbreeding.[31] In some species, such as
the splendid_fairywren (Malurus splendens), females benefit by mating with
multiple males, thus producing more offspring of higher genetic quality.[32]
Some animals are capable of asexual_reproduction, which often results in a
genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation;
budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where
fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids.[33][34]
***** Ecology *****
Predators, such as this ultramarine_flycatcher (Ficedula superciliaris), feed
on other organisms.
Animals are categorised into ecological groups depending on how they obtain or
consume organic material, including carnivores, herbivores, omnivores,
detritivores,[35] and parasites.[36] Interactions between animals form complex
food_webs. In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer-
resource_interaction where a predator feeds on another organism (called its
prey).[37] Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary
arms_race between predator and prey, resulting in various anti-predator
adaptations.[38][39] Almost all multicellular predators are animals.[40] Some
consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid_wasps, the larvae
feed on the hosts' living tissues, killing them in the process,[41] but the
adults primarily consume nectar from flowers.[42] Other animals may have very
specific feeding_behaviours, such as hawksbill_sea_turtles that primarily eat
sponges.[43]
Hydrothermal_vent mussels and shrimps
Most animals rely on the energy produced by plants through photosynthesis.
Herbivores eat plant material directly, while carnivores, and other animals on
higher trophic_levels, typically acquire energy (in the form of reduced carbon)
by eating other animals. The carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and other
biomolecules are broken down to allow the animal to grow and to sustain
biological processes such as locomotion.[44][45][46] Animals living close to
hydrothermal_vents and cold_seeps on the dark sea_floor do not depend on the
energy of sunlight.[47] Rather, archaea and bacteria in these locations produce
organic matter through chemosynthesis (by oxidizing inorganic compounds, such
as methane) and form the base of the local food web.[48]
Animals originally evolved in the sea. Lineages of arthropods colonised land
around the same time as land_plants, probably between 510Ã¢Â€Â“471 million years
ago during the Late_Cambrian or Early Ordovician.[49] Vertebrates such as the
lobe-finned_fish Tiktaalik started to move on to land in the late Devonian,
about 375 million years ago.[50][51] Animals occupy virtually all of earth's
habitats and microhabitats, including salt water, hydrothermal vents, fresh
water, hot springs, swamps, forests, pastures, deserts, air, and the interiors
of animals, plants, fungi and rocks.[52] Animals are however not particularly
heat_tolerant; very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above
50Â Ã‚Â°C (122Â Ã‚Â°F).[53] Only very few species of animals (mostly nematodes)
inhabit the most extreme cold deserts of continental Antarctica.[54]
***** Diversity *****
The blue_whale is the largest animal that has ever lived.
**** Largest and smallest ****
Further information: Largest_organisms and Smallest_organisms
The blue_whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal that has ever
lived, weighing up to 190 metric tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres
(110Â ft) long.[55][56][57] The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African
bush_elephant (Loxodonta africana), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes[55] and
measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0Â ft) long.[55] The largest terrestrial
animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod_dinosaurs such as
Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes.[58] Several
animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa (obligate_parasites within the Cnidaria)
never grow larger than 20Â Ã‚Âµm,[59] and one of the smallest species (Myxobolus
shekel) is no more than 8.5Â Ã‚Âµm when fully grown.[60]
**** Numbers and habitats ****
The following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the
animal groups with the largest numbers of species,[61] along with their
principal habitats (terrestrial, fresh water,[62] and marine),[63] and free-
living or parasitic ways of life.[64] Species estimates shown here are based on
numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated
based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly. For instance,
around 25,000Ã¢Â€Â“27,000 species of nematodes have been described, while
published estimates of the total number of nematode species include
10,000Ã¢Â€Â“20,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million.[65] Using patterns
within the taxonomic hierarchy, the total number of animal speciesÃ¢Â€Â”including
those not yet describedÃ¢Â€Â”was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011.[66]

***** Evolutionary origin *****
Further information: Urmetazoan
Dickinsonia_costata from the Ediacaran_biota (c. 635Ã¢Â€Â“542 MYA) is one of the
earliest animal species known.[77]
The first fossils that might represent animals appear in the 665-million-year-
old rocks of the Trezona_Formation of South_Australia. These fossils are
interpreted as most probably being early sponges.[78]
The oldest animals are found in the Ediacaran_biota, towards the end of the
Precambrian, around 610 million years ago. It had long been doubtful whether
these included animals,[79][80][81] but the discovery of the animal lipid
cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia establishes that these were indeed
animals.[77] Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen
conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic
respiration, but as they became specialized for aerobic metabolism they became
fully dependent on oxygen in their environments.[82]
Anomalocaris_canadensis is one of the many animal species that emerged in the
Cambrian_explosion, starting some 542 million years ago, and found in the
fossil beds of the Burgess_shale.
Many animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian
explosion, starting about 542 million years ago, in beds such as the Burgess
shale. Extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs, brachiopods,
onychophorans, tardigrades, arthropods, echinoderms and hemichordates, along
with numerous now-extinct forms such as the predatory Anomalocaris. The
apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artefact of the fossil
record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously.[83]
[84][85][86]
Some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than
the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago.[87] Trace
fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period may indicate the
presence of triploblastic worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5Â mm wide)
and complex as earthworms.[88] However, similar tracks are produced today by
the giant single-celled protist Gromia_sphaerica, so the Tonian trace fossils
may not indicate early animal evolution.[89][90] Around the same time, another
line of evidence may indicate the appearance of grazing animals: the layered
mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity, perhaps due
to grazing.[91]
***** Phylogeny *****
Further information: Lists_of_animals
Animals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor.
Animals are sister to the Choanoflagellata, with which they form the Choanozoa.
[92] The most basal animals, the Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Placozoa,
have body plans that lack bilateral_symmetry. Their relationships are still
disputed; the sister group to all other animals could be the Porifera or the
Ctenophora, which like the Porifera lack hox_genes, important_in_body_plan
development.[93]
These genes are found in the Placozoa[94][95] and the higher animals, the
Bilateria.[96][97] 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been
identified; these may have arisen from a single common_ancestor that lived 650
million_years_ago in the Precambrian. 25 of these are novel core gene groups,
found only in animals; of those, 8 are for essential components of the Wnt and
TGF-beta signalling pathways which may have enabled animals to become
multicellular by providing a pattern for the body's system of axes (in three
dimensions), and another 7 are for transcription_factors including homeodomain
proteins involved in the control_of_development.[98][99]
The phylogenetic_tree (of major lineages only) indicates approximately how many
millions of years ago (mya) the lineages split.[100][101][102][103][104]

**** Non-bilaterian animals ****
Non-bilaterians include sponges (centre) and corals (background).
Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry. Among these, the sponges
(Porifera) probably diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum.[105]
Sponges lack the complex organization found in most other animal phyla;[106]
their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organised into distinct
tissues.[107] They typically feed by drawing in water through pores.[108]
The Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Cnidaria (which includes jellyfish, sea
anemones, and corals) are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a
single opening, which serves as both mouth and anus.[109] Animals in both phyla
have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into organs.[110] They are
diploblastic, having only two main germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm.[111] The
tiny placozoans are similar, but they do not have a permanent digestive
chamber.[112][113]
**** Bilaterian animals ****
Main articles: Bilateria and Symmetry_(biology)_Ã‚Â§Â Bilateral_symmetry
Idealised bilaterian body plan.[c] With an elongated body and a direction of
movement the animal has head and tail ends. Sense organs and mouth form the
basis_of_the_head. Opposed circular and longitudinal muscles enable peristaltic
motion.
The remaining animals, the great majorityÃ¢Â€Â”comprising some 29 phyla and over a
million speciesÃ¢Â€Â”form a clade, the Bilateria. The body is triploblastic, with
three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form_distinct_organs. The
digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is an
internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom. Animals with this bilaterally
symmetric body_plan and a tendency to move in one direction have a head end
(anterior) and a tail end (posterior) as well as a back (dorsal) and a belly
(ventral); therefore they also have a left side and a right side.[114][115]
Having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as
food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense_organs and
a mouth. Many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict
the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that
shorten the body;[115] these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic
skeleton to move by peristalsis.[116] They also have a gut that extends through
the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have
primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing
sensory cells. However, there are exceptions to each of these characteristics;
for example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae),
while some parasitic_worms have extremely simplified body structures.[114][115]
Genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists' understanding of the
relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major
lineages, the protostomes and the deuterostomes.[117] The basalmost bilaterians
are the Xenacoelomorpha.[118][119][120]
*** Protostomes and deuterostomes ***
Further information: Embryological_origins_of_the_mouth_and_anus
The bilaterian gut develops in two ways. In many protostomes, the blastopore
develops into the mouth, while in deuterostomes it becomes the anus.
Main articles: Protostome and Deuterostome
Protostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development,
deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many
protostomes (the Spiralia) undergo spiral cleavage.[121] Animals from both
groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening
of the embryonic_gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily.
In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily.
[122][123] Most protostomes have schizocoelous_development, where cells simply
fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm. In deuterostomes,
the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic_pouching, through invagination of the
endoderm.[124]
The main deuterostome phyla are the Echinodermata and the Chordata.[125]
Echinoderms are exclusively marine and include starfish, sea_urchins, and sea
cucumbers.[126] The chordates are dominated by the vertebrates (animals with
backbones),[127] which consist of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals.[128] The deuterostomes also include the Hemichordata (acorn worms).
[129][130]
** Ecdysozoa **
Ecdysis: a dragonfly has emerged from its dry exuviae and is expanding its
wings. Like other arthropods, its body is divided_into_segments.
Main article: Ecdysozoa
The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after their shared trait of ecdysis,
growth by moulting.[131] They include the largest animal phylum, the
Arthropoda, which contains insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All of these
have a body divided into repeating_segments, typically with paired appendages.
Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the
arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or
roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically
microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water;[132]
some are important parasites.[133] Smaller phyla related to them are the
Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and
Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.[134]
** Spiralia **
Main article: Spiralia
Spiral_cleavage in a sea snail embryo
The Spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage
in the early embryo.[135] The Spiralia's phylogeny has been disputed, but it
contains a large clade, the superphylum Lophotrochozoa, and smaller groups of
phyla such as the Rouphozoa which includes the gastrotrichs and the flatworms.
All of these are grouped as the Platytrochozoa, which has a sister group, the
Gnathifera, which includes the rotifers.[136][137]
The Lophotrochozoa includes the molluscs, annelids, brachiopods, nemerteans,
bryozoa and entoprocts.[136][138][139] The molluscs, the second-largest animal
phylum by number of described species, includes snails, clams, and squids,
while the annelids are the segmented worms, such as earthworms, lugworms, and
leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because
they share trochophore larvae.[140][141]
***** History of classification *****
Further information: Taxonomy_(biology), History_of_zoology_(through_1859), and
History_of_zoology_since_1859
Jean-Baptiste_de_Lamarck led the creation of a modern classification of
invertebrates, breaking up Linnaeus's "Vermes" into 9 phyla by 1809.[142]
In the classical_era, Aristotle divided_animals,[d] based on his own
observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those
without. The animals were then arranged_on_a_scale from man (with blood, 2
legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, 4
legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many
legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously-generating creatures like sponges
(no blood, no legs, vegetable soul). Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges
were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and
locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch,
and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were
rooted like plants and never moved about.[143]
In 1758, Carl_Linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his
Systema_Naturae.[144] In his original scheme, the animals were one of three
kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves,
and Mammalia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single
phylum, the Chordata, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and
arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in
1793 by Jean-Baptiste_de_Lamarck, who called the Vermes une espÃƒÂ¨ce de chaos (a
chaotic mess)[e] and split the group into three new phyla, worms, echinoderms,
and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie
Zoologique, Lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still
had 4 phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely
cirripedes, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates, polyps,
and infusorians.[142]
In his 1817 Le_RÃƒÂ¨gne_Animal, Georges_Cuvier used comparative_anatomy to group
the animals into four embranchements ("branches" with different body plans,
roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated
animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes_(radiata) (echinoderms,
cnidaria and other forms).[146] This division into four was followed by the
embryologist Karl_Ernst_von_Baer in 1828, the zoologist Louis_Agassiz in 1857,
and the comparative anatomist Richard_Owen in 1860.[147]
In 1874, Ernst_Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa
(multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms,
articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals),
including a sixth animal phylum, sponges.[148][147] The protozoa were later
moved to the former kingdom Protista, leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of
Animalia.[149]
***** In human culture *****

Main article: Animals_in_culture
The human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food,
both of domesticated livestock species in animal_husbandry and, mainly at sea,
by hunting wild species.[150][151] Marine fish of many species are caught
commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed_commercially.
[150][152][153] Invertebrates including cephalopods, crustaceans, and bivalve
or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food.[154] Chickens, cattle,
sheep, pigs and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the
world.[151][155][156] Animal fibres such as wool are used to make textiles,
while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings, and leather is
widely used to make shoes and other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed
for their fur to make items such as coats and hats.[157][158] Dyestuffs
including carmine (cochineal),[159][160] shellac,[161][162] and kermes[163]
[164] have been made from the bodies of insects. Working_animals including
cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of
agriculture.[165]
Animals such as the fruit fly Drosophila_melanogaster serve a major role in
science as experimental_models.[166][167][168][169] Animals have been used to
create vaccines since their discovery in the 18th century.[170] Some medicines
such as the cancer drug Yondelis are based on toxins or other molecules of
animal origin.[171]
A gun_dog retrieving a duck during a hunt
People have used hunting_dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals,[172] and
birds_of_prey to catch birds and mammals,[173] while tethered cormorants have
been used_to_catch_fish.[174] Poison_dart_frogs have been used to poison the
tips of blowpipe_darts.[175][176] A wide variety of animals are kept as pets,
from invertebrates such as tarantulas and octopuses, insects including praying
mantises,[177] reptiles such as snakes and chameleons,[178] and birds including
canaries, parakeets, and parrots[179] all finding a place. However, the most
kept pet species are mammals, namely dogs, cats, and rabbits.[180][181][182]
There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and
their existence as individuals_with_rights of their own.[183] A wide variety of
terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for_sport.[184]
Artistic vision: Still_Life with Lobster and Oysters by Alexander_Coosemans, c.
1660
Animals have been the subjects_of_art from the earliest times, both historical,
as in Ancient_Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave_paintings_at_Lascaux.
Major animal paintings include Albrecht_DÃƒÂ¼rer's 1515 The_Rhinoceros, and
George_Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket.[185] Insects, birds and
mammals play roles in literature and film,[186] such as in giant_bug_movies.
[187][188][189] Animals including insects[190] and mammals[191] feature in
mythology and religion. In both Japan and Europe, a butterfly was seen as the
personification of a person's soul,[190][192][193] while the scarab_beetle was
sacred in ancient Egypt.[194] Among the mammals, cattle,[195] deer,[191]
horses,[196] lions,[197] bats,[198] bears,[199] and wolves[200] are the
subjects of myths and worship. The signs_of_the_Western and Chinese_zodiacs are
based on animals.[201][202]
