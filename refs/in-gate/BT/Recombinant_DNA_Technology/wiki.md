DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods
Construction of recombinant DNA, in which a foreign DNA fragment is inserted
into a plasmid vector. In this example, the gene indicated by the white color
is inactivated upon insertion of the foreign DNA fragment.
Recombinant DNA (rDNA) molecules are DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods
of genetic_recombination (such as molecular_cloning) to bring together genetic
material from multiple sources, creating sequences that would not otherwise be
found in the genome.
Recombinant DNA is the general name for a piece of DNA that has been created by
combining at least two strands. Recombinant DNA is possible because DNA
molecules from all organisms share the same chemical structure, and differ only
in the nucleotide sequence within that identical overall structure. Recombinant
DNA molecules are sometimes called chimeric DNA, because they can be made of
material from two different species, like the mythical chimera. R-DNA
technology uses palindromic_sequences and leads to the production of sticky_and
blunt_ends.
The DNA sequences used in the construction of recombinant DNA molecules can
originate from any species. For example, plant DNA may be joined to bacterial
DNA, or human DNA may be joined with fungal DNA. In addition, DNA sequences
that do not occur anywhere in nature may be created by the chemical_synthesis
of_DNA, and incorporated into recombinant molecules. Using recombinant DNA
technology and synthetic DNA, literally any DNA sequence may be created and
introduced into any of a very wide range of living organisms.
Proteins that can result from the expression of recombinant DNA within living
cells are termed recombinant proteins. When recombinant DNA encoding a protein
is introduced into a host organism, the recombinant protein is not necessarily
produced.[1] Expression of foreign proteins requires the use of specialized
expression vectors and often necessitates significant restructuring by foreign
coding sequences.[2]
Recombinant DNA differs from genetic recombination in that the former results
from artificial methods in the test tube, while the latter is a normal
biological process that results in the remixing of existing DNA sequences in
essentially all organisms.

***** Creation[edit] *****
[Gene_cloning.svg]
Main article: Molecular_cloning
Molecular cloning is the laboratory process used to create recombinant DNA.[3]
[4][5][6] It is one of two most widely used methods, along with polymerase
chain_reaction (PCR), used to direct the replication of any specific DNA
sequence chosen by the experimentalist. There are two fundamental differences
between the methods. One is that molecular cloning involves replication of the
DNA within a living cell, while PCR replicates DNA in the test tube, free of
living cells. The other difference is that cloning involves cutting and pasting
DNA sequences, while PCR amplifies by copying an existing sequence.
Formation of recombinant DNA requires a cloning_vector, a DNA molecule that
replicates within a living cell. Vectors are generally derived from plasmids or
viruses, and represent relatively small segments of DNA that contain necessary
genetic signals for replication, as well as additional elements for convenience
in inserting foreign DNA, identifying cells that contain recombinant DNA, and,
where appropriate, expressing the foreign DNA. The choice of vector for
molecular cloning depends on the choice of host organism, the size of the DNA
to be cloned, and whether and how the foreign DNA is to be expressed.[7] The
DNA segments can be combined by using a variety of methods, such as restriction
enzyme/ligase cloning or Gibson_assembly.
In standard cloning protocols, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially
involves seven steps: (1) Choice of host organism and cloning vector, (2)
Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of
recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into the host organism,
(6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, and (7) Screening for
clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties.[6] These steps are
described in some detail in a related article (molecular_cloning).
***** Expression[edit] *****
Main article: Protein_production
Following transplantation into the host organism, the foreign DNA contained
within the recombinant DNA construct may or may not be expressed. That is, the
DNA may simply be replicated without expression, or it may be transcribed and
translated and a recombinant protein is produced. Generally speaking,
expression of a foreign gene requires restructuring the gene to include
sequences that are required for producing an mRNA molecule that can be used by
the host's translational_apparatus (e.g. promoter, translational_initiation
signal, and transcriptional_terminator).[8] Specific changes to the host
organism may be made to improve expression of the ectopic gene. In addition,
changes may be needed to the coding sequences as well, to optimize translation,
make the protein soluble, direct the recombinant protein to the proper cellular
or extracellular location, and stabilize the protein from degradation.[9][10]
***** Properties of organisms containing recombinant DNA[edit] *****
In most cases, organisms containing recombinant DNA have apparently normal
phenotypes. That is, their appearance, behavior and metabolism are usually
unchanged, and the only way to demonstrate the presence of recombinant
sequences is to examine the DNA itself, typically using a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) test.[11] Significant exceptions exist, and are discussed below.
If the rDNA sequences encode a gene that is expressed, then the presence of RNA
and/or protein products of the recombinant gene can be detected, typically
using RT-PCR or western_hybridization methods.[11] Gross phenotypic changes are
not the norm, unless the recombinant gene has been chosen and modified so as to
generate biological activity in the host organism.[12] Additional phenotypes
that are encountered include toxicity to the host organism induced by the
recombinant gene product, especially if it is over-expressed or expressed
within inappropriate cells or tissues.
In some cases, recombinant DNA can have deleterious effects even if it is not
expressed. One mechanism by which this happens is insertional_inactivation, in
which the rDNA becomes inserted into a host cell's gene. In some cases,
researchers use this phenomenon to "knock_out" genes to determine their
biological function and importance.[13] Another mechanism by which rDNA
insertion into chromosomal DNA can affect gene expression is by inappropriate
activation of previously unexpressed host cell genes. This can happen, for
example, when a recombinant DNA fragment containing an active promoter becomes
located next to a previously silent host cell gene, or when a host cell gene
that functions to restrain gene expression undergoes insertional inactivation
by recombinant DNA.
***** Uses[edit] *****
Recombinant DNA is widely used in biotechnology, medicine and research. Today,
recombinant proteins and other products that result from the use of DNA
technology are found in essentially every western pharmacy, doctor's or
veterinarian's office, medical testing laboratory, and biological research
laboratory. In addition, organisms that have been manipulated using recombinant
DNA technology, as well as products derived from those organisms, have found
their way into many farms, supermarkets, home_medicine_cabinets, and even pet
shops, such as those that sell GloFish and other genetically_modified_animals.
The most common application of recombinant DNA is in basic research, in which
the technology is important to most current work in the biological and
biomedical sciences.[11] Recombinant DNA is used to identify, map and sequence
genes, and to determine their function. rDNA probes are employed in analyzing
gene expression within individual cells, and throughout the tissues of whole
organisms. Recombinant proteins are widely used as reagents in laboratory
experiments and to generate antibody probes for examining protein synthesis
within cells and organisms.[4]
Many additional practical applications of recombinant DNA are found in
industry, food production, human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and
bioengineering.[4] Some specific examples are identified below.
  Recombinant chymosin
      Found in rennet, chymosin is an enzyme required to manufacture cheese. It
      was the first genetically engineered food additive used commercially.
      Traditionally, processors obtained chymosin from rennet, a preparation
      derived from the fourth stomach of milk-fed calves. Scientists engineered
      a non-pathogenic strain (K-12) of E. coli bacteria for large-scale
      laboratory production of the enzyme. This microbiologically produced
      recombinant enzyme, identical structurally to the calf derived enzyme,
      costs less and is produced in abundant quantities. Today about 60% of
      U.S. hard cheese is made with genetically engineered chymosin. In 1990,
      FDA granted chymosin "generally_recognized_as_safe" (GRAS) status based
      on data showing that the enzyme was safe.[14]
  Recombinant human insulin 
      Almost completely replaced insulin obtained from animal sources (e.g.
      pigs and cattle) for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes. A
      variety of different recombinant insulin preparations are in widespread
      use.[15] Recombinant insulin is synthesized by inserting the human
      insulin gene into E._coli, or yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)[16] which
      then produces insulin for human use.[17]
  Recombinant human growth_hormone (HGH, somatotropin) 
      Administered to patients whose pituitary glands generate insufficient
      quantities to support normal growth and development. Before recombinant
      HGH became available, HGH for therapeutic use was obtained from pituitary
      glands of cadavers. This unsafe practice led to some patients developing
      CreutzfeldtâJakob_disease. Recombinant HGH eliminated this problem, and
      is now used therapeutically.[18] It has also been misused as a
      performance-enhancing drug by athletes and others.[19] DrugBank_entry
  Recombinant blood clotting factor_VIII 
      A blood-clotting protein that is administered to patients with forms of
      the bleeding disorder hemophilia, who are unable to produce factor VIII
      in quantities sufficient to support normal blood coagulation.[20] Before
      the development of recombinant factor VIII, the protein was obtained by
      processing large quantities of human blood from multiple donors, which
      carried a very high risk of transmission of blood_borne_infectious
      diseases, for example HIV and hepatitis B. DrugBank_entry
  Recombinant hepatitis_B_vaccine 
      Hepatitis_B infection is controlled through the use of a recombinant
      hepatitis B vaccine, which contains a form of the hepatitis B virus
      surface antigen that is produced in yeast cells. The development of the
      recombinant subunit vaccine was an important and necessary development
      because hepatitis B virus, unlike other common viruses such as polio
      virus, cannot be grown in_vitro. Vaccine_information_from_Hepatitis_B

  Diagnosis of infection with HIV 
      Each of the three widely used methods for diagnosing_HIV_infection has
      been developed using recombinant DNA. The antibody test (ELISA or western
      blot) uses a recombinant HIV protein to test for the presence of
      antibodies that the body has produced in response to an HIV infection.
      The DNA test looks for the presence of HIV genetic material using reverse
      transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction (RT-PCR). Development of the RT-
      PCR test was made possible by the molecular cloning and sequence analysis
      of HIV genomes. HIV_testing_page_from_US_Centers_for_Disease_Control_

  Golden_rice 
      A recombinant variety of rice that has been engineered to express the
      enzymes responsible for Î²-carotene biosynthesis.[12] This variety of
      rice holds substantial promise for reducing the incidence of vitamin_A
      deficiency in the world's population.[21] Golden rice is not currently in
      use, pending the resolution of regulatory and intellectual property[22]
      issues.
  Herbicide-resistant_crops 
      Commercial varieties of important agricultural crops (including soy,
      maize/corn, sorghum, canola, alfalfa and cotton) have been developed that
      incorporate a recombinant gene that results in resistance to the
      herbicide glyphosate (trade name Roundup), and simplifies weed control by
      glyphosate application.[23] These crops are in common commercial use in
      several countries.
  Insect-resistant_crops 
      Bacillus thuringeiensis is a bacterium that naturally produces a protein
      (Bt_toxin) with insecticidal properties.[21] The bacterium has been
      applied to crops as an insect-control strategy for many years, and this
      practice has been widely adopted in agriculture and gardening. Recently,
      plants have been developed that express a recombinant form of the
      bacterial protein, which may effectively control some insect predators.
      Environmental issues associated with the use of these transgenic crops
      have not been fully resolved.[24]
***** History[edit] *****
The idea of recombinant DNA was first proposed by Peter Lobban, a graduate
student of Prof. Dale_Kaiser in the Biochemistry Department at Stanford
University Medical School.[25] The first publications describing the successful
production and intracellular replication of recombinant DNA appeared in 1972
and 1973, from Stanford and UCSF [26][27][28][29]. In 1980 Paul_Berg, a
professor in the Biochemistry Department at Stanford and an author on one of
the first paper [26] was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on
nucleic acids "with particular regard to recombinant DNA". Werner_Arber,
Hamilton_Smith, and Daniel_Nathans shared the 1978 Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or
Medicine for the discovery of restriction_endonucleases which lead to the
development of recombinant DNA technologies.
Stanford_University applied for a US patent on recombinant DNA in 1974, listing
the inventors as Herbert_W._Boyer (professor at the University_of_California,
San_Francisco) and Stanley_N._Cohen (professor at Stanford_University); this
patent was awarded in 1980.[30] The first licensed drug generated using
recombinant DNA technology was human insulin, developed by Genentech and
licensed by Eli_Lilly_and_Company.[31]
***** Controversy[edit] *****
Scientists associated with the initial development of recombinant DNA methods
recognized that the potential existed for organisms containing recombinant DNA
to have undesirable or dangerous properties. At the 1975 Asilomar_Conference_on
Recombinant_DNA, these concerns were discussed and a voluntary moratorium on
recombinant DNA research was initiated for experiments that were considered
particularly risky. This moratorium was widely observed until the National
Institutes of Health (USA) developed and issued formal guidelines for rDNA
work. Today, recombinant DNA molecules and recombinant proteins are usually not
regarded as dangerous. However, concerns remain about some organisms that
express recombinant DNA, particularly when they leave the laboratory and are
introduced into the environment or food chain. These concerns are discussed in
the articles on genetically_modified_organisms and genetically_modified_food
controversies. Furthermore, there are concerns about the by-products in
biopharmaceutical production, where recombinant DNA result in specific protein
products. The major by-product, termed host_cell_protein, comes from the host
expression system and poses a threat to the patient's health and the overall
environment.[32][33]
