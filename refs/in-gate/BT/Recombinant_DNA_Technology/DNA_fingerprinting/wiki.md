DNA profiling (also called DNA fingerprinting) is the process of determining an
individual's DNA characteristics, which are as unique as fingerprints. DNA
analysis intended to identify a species, rather than an individual, is called
DNA_barcoding.
DNA profiling is a forensic technique in criminal_investigations, comparing
criminal suspects' profiles to DNA evidence so as to assess the likelihood of
their involvement in the crime.[1] It is also used in parentage_testing,[2] to
establish immigration eligibility,[3] and in genealogical and medical research.
DNA profiling has also been used in the study of animal and plant populations
in the fields of zoology, botany, and agriculture.[4]

***** Background[edit] *****
Starting in the 1980s scientific advances allowed for the use of DNA as a
mechanism for the identification of an individual. The first patent covering
the modern process of DNA profiling was filed by Dr._Jeffrey_Glassberg[5] in
1983, based upon work he had done while at Rockefeller University in 1981.
Glassberg, along with two medical doctors, founded Lifecodes Corporation[6][7]
to bring this invention to market. The Glassberg patent was issued in Belgium
BE899027A1,[8] Canada FR2541774A1,[9] Germany DE3407196 A1,[10] Great Britain
GB8405107D0,[11] Japan JPS59199000A,[12] United States as US5593832A.[13][14]
In the United_Kingdom, Geneticist Sir Alec_Jeffreys[15][16][17][18]
independently developed a DNA profiling process in beginning in late 1984[19]
while working in the Department of Genetics at the University_of_Leicester.[20]
The process, developed by Jeffreys in conjunction with Peter Gill and Dave
Werrett of the Forensic_Science_Service (FSS), was first used forensically in
the solving of the murder of two teenagers who had been raped and murdered in
Narborough,_Leicestershire in 1983 and 1986. In the murder inquiry, led by
Detective David_Baker, the DNA contained within blood samples obtained
voluntarily from around 5,000 local men who willingly assisted Leicestershire
Constabulary with the investigation, resulted in the exoneration of Richard
Buckland, an initial suspect who had confessed to one of the crimes, and the
subsequent conviction of Colin_Pitchfork on January 2, 1988. Pitchfork, a local
bakery employee, had coerced his coworker Ian Kelly to stand in for him when
providing a blood sampleâKelly then used a forged passport to impersonate
Pitchfork. Another coworker reported the deception to the police. Pitchfork was
arrested, and his blood was sent to Jeffrey's lab for processing and profile
development. Pitchfork's profile matched that of DNA left by the murderer which
confirmed Pitchfork's presence at both crime scenes; he pleaded guilty to both
murders.[21]
Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of
the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from
another, unless they are monozygotic_(identical)_twins.[22] DNA profiling uses
repetitive sequences that are highly variable,[22] called variable_number
tandem_repeats (VNTRs), in particular short tandem repeats (STRs), also known
as microsatellites, and minisatellites. VNTR loci are similar between closely
related individuals, but are so variable that unrelated individuals are
unlikely to have the same VNTRs.
In India DNA fingerprinting was started by Dr. VK Kashyap and Dr. Lalji_Singh.
Singh was an Indian scientist who worked in the field of DNA fingerprinting
technology in India, where he was popularly known as the "Father of Indian DNA
fingerprinting".[23] In 2004, he received the Padma_Shri in recognition of his
contribution to Indian science and technology.[24]
***** Profiling processes[edit] *****
              Variations of VNTR allele lengths in 6 individuals.
Alec_Jeffreys, a pioneer of DNA profiling.
The process, developed by Glassberg and independently by Jeffreys, begins with
a sample of an individual's DNA (typically called a "reference sample").
Reference samples are usually collected through a buccal_swab. When this is
unavailable (for example, when a court order is needed but unobtainable) other
methods may be needed to collect a sample of blood, saliva, semen, vaginal
lubrication, or other fluid or tissue from personal use items (for example, a
toothbrush, razor) or from stored samples (for example, banked sperm or biopsy
tissue). Samples obtained from blood relatives can indicate an individual's
profile, as could previous profiled human remains. A reference sample is then
analyzed to create the individual's DNA profile using one of the techniques
discussed below. The DNA profile is then compared against another sample to
determine whether there is a genetic match.
**** DNA_Extraction[edit] ****
When a sample such as blood or saliva is obtained, the DNA is only a small part
of what is present in the sample. Before the DNA can be analyzed, it must be
extracted from the cells and purified. There are many ways this can be
accomplished, but all methods follow the same basic procedure. The cell and
nuclear membranes need to be broken up to allow the DNA to be free in solution.
Once the DNA is free, it can be separated from all other cellular components.
After the DNA has been separated in solution, the remaining cellular debris can
then be removed from the solution and discarded, leaving only DNA.[25] The most
common methods of DNA extraction include organic_extraction (also called phenol
chloroform extraction), Chelex_extraction, and solid_phase_extraction.
Differential_extraction is a modified version of extraction in which DNA from
two different types of cells can be separated from each other before being
purified from the solution. Each method of extraction works well in the
laboratory, but analysts typically selects their preferred method based on
factors such as the cost, the time involved, the quantity of DNA yielded, and
the quality of DNA yielded.[26] After the DNA is extracted from the sample, it
can be analyzed, whether it be RFLP analysis or quantification and PCR
analysis.
**** RFLP analysis[edit] ****
Main article: Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism
The first methods for finding out genetics used for DNA profiling involved RFLP
analysis. DNA is collected from cells and cut into small pieces using a
restriction_enzyme (a restriction digest). This generates DNA fragments of
differing sizes as a consequence of variations between DNA sequences of
different individuals. The fragments are then separated on the basis of size
using gel_electrophoresis.
The separated fragments are then transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon
filter; this procedure is called a Southern_blot. The DNA fragments within the
blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are denatured.
Radiolabeled probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences
in the genome that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to
vary in length among different individuals and are called variable_number
tandem_repeat sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules hybridize to DNA
fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed
away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have
bound to the probe molecules appear as fluoresent bands on the film.
The Southern blot technique requires large amounts of non-degraded sample DNA.
Also, Karl Brown's original technique looked at many minisatellite loci at the
same time, increasing the observed variability, but making it hard to discern
individual alleles (and thereby precluding paternity_testing). These early
techniques have been supplanted by PCR-based assays.
**** Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis[edit] ****
Main article: Polymerase_chain_reaction
Developed by Kary_Mullis in 1983, a process was reported by which specific
portions of the sample DNA can be amplified almost indefinitely (Saiki et al.
1985, 1985) The process, polymerase_chain_reaction (PCR), mimics the biological
process of DNA_replication, but confines it to specific DNA sequences of
interest. With the invention of the PCR technique, DNA profiling took huge
strides forward in both discriminating power and the ability to recover
information from very small (or degraded) starting samples.
PCR greatly amplifies the amounts of a specific region of DNA. In the PCR
process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual
polynucleotide strands through heating. Two oligonucleotide DNA primers are
used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in
such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of
each primer (that is, the 3â end) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses
replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the
thermostable Taq_polymerase. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of
interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in
this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of
interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from
commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater
amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.
Early assays such as the HLA-DQ_alpha reverse dot_blot strips grew to be very
popular due to their ease of use, and the speed with which a result could be
obtained. However, they were not as discriminating as RFLP analysis. It was
also difficult to determine a DNA profile for mixed samples, such as a vaginal
swab from a sexual_assault victim.
However, the PCR method was readily adaptable for analyzing VNTR, in particular
STR loci. In recent years, research in human DNA quantitation has focused on
new "real-time" quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques. Quantitative PCR methods
enable automated, precise, and high-throughput measurements. Inter-laboratory
studies have demonstrated the importance of human DNA quantitation on achieving
reliable interpretation of STR typing and obtaining consistent results across
laboratories.
**** STR analysis[edit] ****
Main article: Short_tandem_repeats
The system of DNA profiling used today is based on polymerase_chain_reaction
(PCR) and uses simple sequences[27] or short tandem repeats (STR). This method
uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the
most common is 4 bases repeated, but there are other lengths in use, including
3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different
numbers of repeat units, STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated
individuals. These STR loci (locations on a chromosome) are targeted with
sequence-specific primers and amplified using PCR. The DNA fragments that
result are then separated and detected using electrophoresis. There are two
common methods of separation and detection, capillary_electrophoresis (CE) and
gel electrophoresis.
Each STR is polymorphic, but the number of alleles is very small. Typically
each STR allele will be shared by around 5 - 20% of individuals. The power of
STR analysis comes from looking at multiple STR loci simultaneously. The
pattern of alleles can identify an individual quite accurately. Thus STR
analysis provides an excellent identification tool. The more STR regions that
are tested in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes.
From country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use.
In North America, systems that amplify the CODIS 20[28] core loci are almost
universal, whereas in the United Kingdom the DNA-17 17 loci system (which is
compatible with The National_DNA_Database) is in use, and Australia uses 18
core markers.[29] Whichever system is used, many of the STR regions used are
the same. These DNA-profiling systems are based on multiplex reactions, whereby
many STR regions will be tested at the same time.
The true power of STR_analysis is in its statistical power of discrimination.
Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are
independently_assorted (having a certain number of repeats at one locus does
not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus),
the product_rule_for_probabilities can be applied. This means that, if someone
has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, we can say that
the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A
times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C.
This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a
quintillion (1x1018) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more
frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.[30] Moreover, since there are
about 12 million monozygotic_twins on Earth, the theoretical probability is not
accurate.
In practice, the risk of contaminated-matching is much greater than matching a
distant relative, such as contamination of a sample from nearby objects, or
from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. The risk is greater for
matching the most common person in the samples: Everything collected from, or
in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other
samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are
typically tested in order to ensure that they stayed clean, when prepared
during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or
variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of
contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full DNA
profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person was not
actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.
**** AFLP[edit] ****
Main article: Amplified_fragment_length_polymorphism
Another technique, AFLP, or amplified fragment length polymorphism was also put
into practice during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP
analysis and used PCR to amplify DNA samples. It relied on variable_number
tandem_repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were
separated on a polyacrylamide_gel using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a
molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by silver_staining the gel.
One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based
methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic
dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other
stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very
high number repeats may bunch together at the top of the gel, making it
difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for
easy creation of phylogenetic trees based on comparing individual samples of
DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP
remains popular in lower income countries.
**** DNA family relationship analysis[edit] ****
1: A cell sample is taken- usually a cheek swab or blood test 2: DNA is
extracted from sample 3: Cleavage of DNA by restriction enzyme- the DNA is
broken into small fragments 4: Small fragments are amplified by the polymerase
chain reaction- results in many more fragments 5: DNA fragments are separated
by electrophoresis 6: The fragments are transferred to an agar plate 7: On the
agar plate specific DNA fragments are bound to a radioactive DNA probe 8: The
agar plate is washed free of excess probe 9: An x-ray film is used to detect a
radioactive pattern 10: The DNA is compared to other DNA samples
Using PCR technology, DNA analysis is widely applied to determine genetic
family relationships such as paternity, maternity, siblingship and other
kinships.
During conception, the father's sperm cell and the mother's egg cell, each
containing half the amount of DNA found in other body cells, meet and fuse to
form a fertilized egg, called a zygote. The zygote contains a complete set of
DNA molecules, a unique combination of DNA from both parents. This zygote
divides and multiplies into an embryo and later, a full human being.
At each stage of development, all the cells forming the body contain the same
DNAâhalf from the father and half from the mother. This fact allows the
relationship testing to use all types of all samples including loose cells from
the cheeks collected using buccal swabs, blood or other types of samples.
There are predictable inheritance patterns at certain locations (called loci)
in the human genome, which have been found to be useful in determining identity
and biological relationships. These loci contain specific DNA markers that
scientists use to identify individuals. In a routine DNA paternity test, the
markers used are short_tandem_repeats (STRs), short pieces of DNA that occur in
highly differential repeat patterns among individuals.
Each person's DNA contains two copies of these markersâone copy inherited
from the father and one from the mother. Within a population, the markers at
each person's DNA location could differ in length and sometimes sequence,
depending on the markers inherited from the parents.
The combination of marker sizes found in each person makes up his/her unique
genetic profile. When determining the relationship between two individuals,
their genetic profiles are compared to see if they share the same inheritance
patterns at a statistically conclusive rate.
For example, the following sample report from this commercial DNA paternity
testing laboratory Universal Genetics signifies how relatedness between parents
and child is identified on those special markers:
DNA marker Mother   Child  Alleged father
D21S11     28, 30   28, 31 29, 31
D7S820     9, 10    10, 11 11, 12
TH01       14, 15   14, 16 15, 16
D13S317    7, 8     7, 9   8, 9
D19S433    14, 16.2 14, 15 15, 17
The partial results indicate that the child and the alleged father's DNA match
among these five markers. The complete test results show this correlation on 16
markers between the child and the tested man to enable a conclusion to be drawn
as to whether or not the man is the biological father.
Each marker is assigned with a Paternity Index (PI), which is a statistical
measure of how powerfully a match at a particular marker indicates paternity.
The PI of each marker is multiplied with each other to generate the Combined
Paternity Index (CPI), which indicates the overall probability of an individual
being the biological father of the tested child relative to a randomly selected
man from the entire population of the same race. The CPI is then converted into
a Probability of Paternity showing the degree of relatedness between the
alleged father and child.
The DNA test report in other family relationship tests, such as grandparentage
and siblingship tests, is similar to a paternity test report. Instead of the
Combined Paternity Index, a different value, such as a Siblingship Index, is
reported.
The report shows the genetic profiles of each tested person. If there are
markers shared among the tested individuals, the probability of biological
relationship is calculated to determine how likely the tested individuals share
the same markers due to a blood relationship.
**** Y-chromosome analysis[edit] ****
Recent innovations have included the creation of primers targeting polymorphic
regions on the Y-chromosome (Y-STR), which allows resolution of a mixed DNA
sample from a male and female or cases in which a differential_extraction is
not possible. Y-chromosomes are paternally inherited, so Y-STR analysis can
help in the identification of paternally related males. Y-STR analysis was
performed in the Sally_Hemings controversy to determine if Thomas_Jefferson had
sired a son with one of his slaves. The analysis of the Y-chromosome yields
weaker results than autosomal chromosome analysis. The Y male sex-determining
chromosome, as it is inherited only by males from their fathers, is almost
identical along the patrilineal line. This leads to a less precise analysis
than if autosomal chromosomes were testing, because of the random matching that
occurs between pairs of chromosomes as zygotes are being made.[31]
**** Mitochondrial analysis[edit] ****
Main article: Mitochondrial_DNA
For highly degraded samples, it is sometimes impossible to get a complete
profile of the 13 CODIS STRs. In these situations, mitochondrial_DNA (mtDNA) is
sometimes typed due to there being many copies of mtDNA in a cell, while there
may only be 1-2 copies of the nuclear DNA. Forensic scientists amplify the HV1
and HV2 regions of the mtDNA, and then sequence each region and compare single-
nucleotide differences to a reference. Because mtDNA is maternally inherited,
directly linked maternal relatives can be used as match references, such as
one's maternal grandmother's daughter's son. In general, a difference of two or
more nucleotides is considered to be an exclusion. Heteroplasmy and poly-
C differences may throw off straight sequence comparisons, so some expertise on
the part of the analyst is required. mtDNA is useful in determining clear
identities, such as those of missing people when a maternally linked relative
can be found. mtDNA testing was used in determining that Anna_Anderson was not
the Russian princess she had claimed to be, Anastasia_Romanov.
mtDNA can be obtained from such material as hair shafts and old bones/teeth.

determined by tooled placement in sample.[citation_needed]
***** Issues with forensic DNA samples[edit] *****
When people think of DNA analysis they often think about shows like NCIS or
CSI, which portray DNA samples coming into a lab and then instantly analyzed,
followed by pulling up a picture of the suspect within
minutesâ ââ ââ ââ the reality, however, is quite different, and
perfect DNA samples are often not collected from the scene of a crime. Homicide
victims are frequently left exposed to harsh conditions before they are found
and objects used to commit crimes have often been handled by more than one
person. The two most prevalent issues that forensic scientists encounter when
analyzing DNA samples are degraded samples and DNA mixtures.
**** Degraded DNA[edit] ****
In the real world DNA labs often have to deal with DNA samples that are less
than ideal. DNA samples taken from crime scenes are often degraded, which means
that the DNA has started to break down into smaller fragments DNA
fragmentation. Victims of homicides might not be discovered right away, and in
the case of a mass casualty event it could be hard to get DNA samples before
the DNA has been exposed to degradation elements.
Degradation or fragmentation of DNA at crime scenes can occur because of a
number of reasons, with environmental exposure often being the most common
cause. Biological samples that have been exposed to the environment can get
degraded by water and enzymes called nucleases Nuclease. Nucleases essentially
âchewâ up the DNA into fragments over time and are found everywhere in
nature.
Before modern PCR methods existed it was almost impossible to analyze degraded
DNA samples. Methods like restriction fragment length polymorphism or RFLP
Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism, which was the first technique used
for DNA analysis in forensic science, required high molecular weight DNA in the
sample in order to get reliable data. High molecular weight DNA however is
something that is lacking in degraded samples, as the DNA is too fragmented to
accurately carry out RFLP. It wasn't until modern day PCR techniques were
invented that analysis of degraded DNA samples were able to be carried out
Polymerase_chain_reaction. Multiplex PCR in particular made it possible to
isolate and amplify the small fragments of DNA still left in degraded samples.
When multiplex PCR methods are compared to the older methods like RFLP a vast
difference can be seen. Multiplex PCR can theoretically amplify less than 1 ng
of DNA, while RFLP had to have a least 100 ng of DNA in order to carry out an
analysis.[33]
In terms of a forensic approach to a degraded DNA sample, STR loci STR_analysis
are often amplified using PCR-based methods. Though STR loci are amplified with
greater probability of success with degraded DNA, there is still the
possibility that larger STR loci will fail to amplify, and therefore, would
likely yield a partial profile, which results in reduced statistical weight of
association in the event of a match.
*** MiniSTR Analysis[edit] ***
In instances where DNA samples are degraded, like in the case of intense fires
or if all that remains are bone fragments, standard STR testing on these
samples can be inadequate. When standard STR testing is done on highly degraded
samples the larger STR loci often drop out, and only partial DNA profiles are
obtained. While partial DNA profiles can be a powerful tool, the random match
probabilities will be larger than if a full profile was obtained. One method
that has been developed in order to analyse degraded DNA samples is to use
miniSTR technology. In this new approach, primers are specially designed to
bind closer to the STR region.[34] In normal STR testing the primers will bind
to longer sequences that contain the STR region within the segment. MiniSTR
analysis however will just target the STR location, and this results in a DNA
product that is much smaller.[34]
By placing the primers closer to the actual STR regions, there is a higher
chance that successful amplification of this region will occur. Successful
amplification of these STR regions can now occur and more complete DNA profiles
can be obtained. The success that smaller PCR products produce a higher success
rate with highly degraded samples was first reported in 1995, when miniSTR
technology was used to identify victims of the Waco fire.[35] In this case the
fire at destroyed the DNA samples so badly that normal STR testing did not
result in a positive ID on some of the victims.
**** DNA Mixtures[edit] ****
Mixtures are another common issue that forensic scientists face when they are
analyzing unknown or questionable DNA samples. A mixture is defined as a DNA
sample that contains two or more individual contributors.[36] This can often
occur when a DNA sample is swabbed from an item that is handled by more than
one person or when a sample contains both the victim and assailants' DNA. The
presence of more than one individual in a DNA sample can make it challenging to
detect individual profiles, and interpretation of mixtures should only be done
by highly trained individuals. Mixtures that contain two or three individuals
can be interpreted, though it will be difficult. Mixtures that contain four or
more individuals are much too convoluted to get individual profiles. One common
scenario in which a mixture is often obtained is in the case of sexual assault.
A sample may be collected that contains material from the victim, the victim's
consensual sexual partners, and the perpetrator(s).[37]
As detection methods in DNA profiling advance, forensic scientists are seeing
more DNA samples that contain mixtures, as even the smallest contributor is now
able to be detected by modern tests. The ease in which forensic scientists have
in interpenetrating DNA mixtures largely depends on the ratio of DNA present
from each individual, the genotype combinations, and total amount of DNA
amplified.[38] The DNA ratio is often the most important aspect to look at in
determining whether a mixture can be interpreted. For example, in the case
where a DNA sample had two contributors, it would be easy to interpret
individual profiles if the ratio of DNA contributed by one person was much
higher than the second person. When a sample has three or more contributors, it
becomes extremely difficult to determine individual profiles. Fortunately,
advancements in probabilistic genotyping could make this sort of determination
possible in the future. Probabilistic_genotyping uses complex computer software
to run through thousands of mathematical computations in order to produce
statistical likelihoods of individual genotypes found in a mixture.[39]
Probabilistic genotyping software that are often used in labs today include
STRmix and TrueAllele.
***** DNA databases[edit] *****
Main article: National_DNA_database
An early application of a DNA_database was the compilation of a Mitochondrial
DNA Concordance,[40] prepared by Kevin W. P. Miller and John L. Dawson at the
University_of_Cambridge from 1996 to 1998[41] from data collected as part of
Miller's PhD thesis. There are now several DNA_databases in existence around
the world. Some are private, but most of the largest databases are government-
controlled. The United_States maintains the largest DNA_database, with the
Combined_DNA_Index_System (CODIS) holding over 13 million records as of May
2018.[42] The United_Kingdom maintains the National_DNA_Database (NDNAD), which
is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this
database, and its rate of growth, are giving concern to civil_liberties groups
in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain
them even in the event of acquittal.[43] The ConservativeâLiberal Democrat
coalition partially addressed these concerns with part 1 of the Protection_of
Freedoms_Act_2012, under which DNA samples must be deleted if suspects are
acquitted or not charged, except in relation to certain (mostly serious and/or
sexual) offenses. Public discourse around the introduction of advanced forensic
techniques (such as genetic genealogy using public genealogy databases and DNA
phenotyping approaches) has been limited, disjointed, unfocused, and raises
issues of privacy and consent that may warrant the establishment of additional
legal protections.[44]
The U.S._Patriot_Act of the United States provides a means for the U.S.
government to get DNA samples from suspected terrorists. DNA information from
crimes is collected and deposited into the CODIS database, which is maintained
by the FBI. CODIS enables law enforcement officials to test DNA samples from
crimes for matches within the database, providing a means of finding specific
biological profiles associated with collected DNA evidence.[45]
When a match is made from a national DNA databank to link a crime scene to an
offender having provided a DNA sample to a database, that link is often
referred to as a cold hit. A cold hit is of value in referring the police
agency to a specific suspect but is of less evidential value than a DNA match
made from outside the DNA Databank.[46]
FBI agents cannot legally store DNA of a person not convicted of a crime. DNA
collected from a suspect not later convicted must be disposed of and not
entered into the database. In 1998, a man residing in the UK was arrested on
accusation of burglary. His DNA was taken and tested, and he was later
released. Nine months later, this man's DNA was accidentally and illegally
entered in the DNA database. New DNA is automatically compared to the DNA found
at cold cases and, in this case, this man was found to be a match to DNA found
at a rape and assault case one year earlier. The government then prosecuted him
for these crimes. During the trial the DNA match was requested to be removed
from the evidence because it had been illegally entered into the database. The
request was carried out.[47] The DNA of the perpetrator, collected from victims
of rape, can be stored for years until a match is found. In 2014, to address
this problem, Congress extended a bill that helps states deal with "a backlog"
of evidence.[48]
***** Considerations when evaluating DNA evidence[edit] *****
As DNA profiling became a key piece of evidence in the court, defense lawyers
based their arguments on statistical reasoning. For example: Given a match that
had a 1 in 5 million probability of occurring by chance, the lawyer would argue
that this meant that in a country of say 60 million people there were 12 people
who would also match the profile. This was then translated to a 1 in 12 chance
of the suspect's being the guilty one. This argument is not sound unless the
suspect was drawn at random from the population of the country. In fact, a jury
should consider how likely it is that an individual matching the genetic
profile would also have been a suspect in the case for other reasons. Also,
different DNA analysis processes can reduce the amount of DNA recovery if the
procedures are not properly done. Therefore, the number of times a piece of
evidence is sampled can diminish the DNA collection efficiency. Another
spurious statistical argument is based on the false assumption that a 1 in 5
million probability of a match automatically translates into a 1 in 5 million
probability of innocence and is known as the prosecutor's_fallacy.
When using RFLP, the theoretical risk of a coincidental match is 1 in 100
billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000
because monozygotic_twins are 0.2% of the human population.[citation_needed]
Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this,
and often actual laboratory procedures do not reflect the theory under which
the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence
probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two
samples have bands in precisely the same location, but a laboratory worker may
conclude that similarâbut not precisely identicalâband patterns result from
identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However,
in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding
the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high
error rates, which may be cause for concern.[49] In the early days of genetic
fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match
probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low
ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis
rather than the higher theoretically computed ones.[50] Today, RFLP has become
widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier
technologies.
Since 1998, the DNA profiling system supported by The National DNA Database in
the UK is the SGM+ DNA profiling system that includes 10 STR regions and a sex-
indicating test. STRs do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar
power of discrimination (1 in 1013 for unrelated individuals if using a full
SGM+ profile). Figures of this magnitude are not considered to be statistically
supportable by scientists in the UK; for unrelated individuals with full
matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered
statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror
should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise
doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source
of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been
adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, chimerism is one such
instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.
**** Evidence of genetic relationship[edit] ****
It is possible to use DNA profiling as evidence of genetic relationship,
although such evidence varies in strength from weak to positive. Testing that
shows no relationship is absolutely certain. Further, while almost all
individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, ultra-rare individuals,
known as "chimeras", have at least two different sets of genes. There have been
two cases of DNA profiling that falsely suggested that a mother was unrelated
to her children.[51] This happens when two eggs are fertilized at the same time
and fuse together to create one individual instead of twins.
***** Fake DNA evidence[edit] *****
In one case, a criminal planted fake DNA evidence in his own body: John
Schneeberger raped one of his sedated patients in 1992 and left semen on her
underwear. Police drew what they believed to be Schneeberger's blood and
compared its DNA against the crime scene semen DNA on three occasions, never
showing a match. It turned out that he had surgically inserted a Penrose_drain
into his arm and filled it with foreign blood and anticoagulants.
The functional analysis of genes and their coding sequences (open_reading
frames [ORFs]) typically requires that each ORF be expressed, the encoded
protein purified, antibodies produced, phenotypes examined, intracellular
localization determined, and interactions with other proteins sought.[52] In a
study conducted by the life science company Nucleix and published in the
journal Forensic_Science_International, scientists found that an in_vitro
synthesized sample of DNA matching any desired genetic profile can be
constructed using standard molecular_biology techniques without obtaining any
actual tissue from that person. Nucleix claims they can also prove the
difference between non-altered DNA and any that was synthesized.[53]
In the case of the Phantom_of_Heilbronn, police detectives found DNA traces
from the same woman on various crime scenes in Austria, Germany, and
Franceâamong them murders, burglaries and robberies. Only after the DNA of
the "woman" matched the DNA sampled from the burned body of a male asylum
seeker in France did detectives begin to have serious doubts about the DNA
evidence. It was eventually discovered that DNA traces were already present on
the cotton_swabs used to collect the samples at the crime scene, and the swabs
had all been produced at the same factory in Austria. The company's product
specification said that the swabs were guaranteed to be sterile, but not DNA-
free.

**** Familial DNA searching[edit] ****
Familial DNA searching (sometimes referred to as "familial DNA" or "familial
DNA database searching") is the practice of creating new investigative leads in
cases where DNA evidence found at the scene of a crime (forensic profile)
strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a
state DNA database but there is not an exact match.[54][55] After all other
leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software
to compare the forensic profile to all profiles taken from a state's DNA
database to generate a list of those offenders already in the database who are
most likely to be a very close relative of the individual whose DNA is in the
forensic profile.[56] To eliminate the majority of this list when the forensic
DNA is a man's, crime lab technicians conduct Y-STR analysis. Using standard
investigative techniques, authorities are then able to build a family tree. The
family tree is populated from information gathered from public_records and
criminal justice records. Investigators rule out family members' involvement in
the crime by finding excluding factors such as sex, living out of state or
being incarcerated when the crime was committed. They may also use other leads
from the case, such as witness or victim statements, to identify a suspect.
Once a suspect has been identified, investigators seek to legally obtain a DNA
sample from the suspect. This suspect DNA profile is then compared to the
sample found at the crime scene to definitively identify the suspect as the
source of the crime scene DNA.
Familial DNA database searching was first used in an investigation leading to
the conviction of Jeffrey Gafoor of the murder_of_Lynette_White in the United
Kingdom on 4 July 2003. DNA evidence was matched to Gafoor's nephew, who at 14
years old had not been born at the time of the murder in 1988. It was used
again in 2004[57] to find a man who threw a brick from a motorway bridge and
hit a lorry driver, killing him. DNA found on the brick matched that found at
the scene of a car theft earlier in the day, but there were no good matches on
the national DNA database. A wider search found a partial match to an
individual; on being questioned, this man revealed he had a brother, Craig
Harman, who lived very close to the original crime scene. Harman voluntarily
submitted a DNA sample, and confessed when it matched the sample from the
brick.[58] Currently, familial DNA database searching is not conducted on a
national level in the United States, where states determine how and when to
conduct familial searches. The first familial DNA search with a subsequent
conviction in the United States was conducted in Denver, Colorado, in 2008,
using software developed under the leadership of Denver_District_Attorney Mitch
Morrissey and Denver Police Department Crime Lab Director Gregg LaBerge.[59]
California was the first state to implement a policy for familial searching
under then Attorney General, now Governor, Jerry_Brown.[60] In his role as
consultant to the Familial Search Working Group of the California_Department_of
Justice, former Alameda_County Prosecutor Rock Harmon is widely considered to
have been the catalyst in the adoption of familial search technology in
California. The technique was used to catch the Los Angeles serial killer known
as the "Grim_Sleeper" in 2010.[61] It wasn't a witness or informant that tipped
off law enforcement to the identity of the "Grim Sleeper" serial killer, who
had eluded police for more than two decades, but DNA from the suspect's own
son. The suspect's son had been arrested and convicted in a felony weapons
charge and swabbed for DNA the year before. When his DNA was entered into the
database of convicted felons, detectives were alerted to a partial match to
evidence found at the "Grim Sleeper" crime scenes. David Franklin Jr., also
known as the Grim Sleeper, was charged with ten counts of murder and one count
of attempted murder.[62] More recently, familial DNA led to the arrest of 21-
year-old Elvis Garcia on charges of sexual assault and false imprisonment of a
woman in Santa_Cruz in 2008.[63] In March 2011 Virginia Governor Bob_McDonnell
announced that Virginia would begin using familial DNA searches.[64] Other
states are expected to follow.
At a press conference in Virginia on March 7, 2011, regarding the East_Coast
Rapist, Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert and Fairfax County Police
Detective John Kelly said the case would have been solved years ago if Virginia
had used familial DNA searching. Aaron Thomas, the suspected East Coast Rapist,
was arrested in connection with the rape of 17 women from Virginia to Rhode
Island, but familial DNA was not used in the case.[65]
Critics of familial DNA database searches argue that the technique is an
invasion of an individual's 4th_Amendment rights.[66] Privacy advocates are
petitioning for DNA database restrictions, arguing that the only fair way to
search for possible DNA matches to relatives of offenders or arrestees would be
to have a population-wide DNA database.[47] Some scholars have pointed out that
the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are similar in some
respects to other police search techniques,[67] and most have concluded that
the practice is constitutional.[68] The Ninth_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals in
United States v. Pool (vacated as moot) suggested that this practice is
somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and
stating that it looked like the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to
show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is
identified as the perpetrator.[69] Regardless of whether familial DNA searching
was the method used to identify the suspect, authorities always conduct a
normal DNA test to match the suspect's DNA with that of the DNA left at the
crime scene.
Critics also claim that racial profiling could occur on account of familial DNA
testing. In the United States, the conviction rates of racial minorities are
much higher than that of the overall population. It is unclear whether this is
due to discrimination from police officers and the courts, as opposed to a
simple higher rate of offence among minorities. Arrest-based databases, which
are found in the majority of the United States, lead to an even greater level
of racial discrimination. An arrest, as opposed to conviction, relies much more
heavily on police discretion.[47]
For instance, investigators with Denver District Attorney's Office successfully
identified a suspect in a property theft case using a familial DNA search. In
this example, the suspect's blood left at the scene of the crime strongly
resembled that of a current Colorado_Department_of_Corrections prisoner.[70]
Using publicly available records, the investigators created a family tree. They
then eliminated all the family members who were incarcerated at the time of the
offense, as well as all of the females (the crime scene DNA profile was that of
a male). Investigators obtained a court order to collect the suspect's DNA, but
the suspect actually volunteered to come to a police station and give a DNA
sample. After providing the sample, the suspect walked free without further
interrogation or detainment. Later confronted with an exact match to the
forensic profile, the suspect pleaded guilty to criminal trespass at the first
court date and was sentenced to two years probation.
In Italy a familiar DNA search has been done to solve the case of the murder_of
Yara_Gambirasio whose body was found in the bush[clarification_needed] three
months after her disappearance. A DNA trace was found on the underwear of the
murdered teenage near and a DNA sample was requested from a person who lived
near the municipality of Brembate_di_Sopra and a common male ancestor was found
in the DNA sample of a young man not involved in the murder. After a long
investigation the father of the supposed killer was identified as Giuseppe
Guerinoni, a deceased man, but his two sons born from his wife were not related
to the DNA samples found on the body of Yara. After three and a half years the
DNA found on the underwear of the deceased girl was matched with Massimo
Giuseppe Bosetti who was arrested and accused of the murder of the 13-year-old
girl. In the summer of 2016 Bosetti was found guilty and sentenced to life by
the Corte_d'assise of Bergamo.
**** Partial matches[edit] ****
Partial DNA matches are not searches[clarification_needed] themselves, but are
the result of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match
that shares at least one allele at every locus.[71] Partial matching does not
involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the UK and
United States, or additional Y-STR analysis, and therefore often misses sibling
relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several
cases in the UK and United States,[72] and has also been used as a tool to
exonerate the falsely accused. Darryl_Hunt was wrongly convicted in connection
with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina.[73] Hunt
was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close
match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The
partial match led investigators to the felon's brother, Willard E. Brown, who
confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order
to dismiss the case against Hunt. In Italy, partial matching has been used in
the controversial murder_of_Yara_Gambirasio, a child found dead about a month
after her presumed kidnapping. In this case, the partial match has been used as
the only incriminating element against the defendant, Massimo Bossetti, who has
been subsequently condemned for the murder (waiting appeal by the Italian
Supreme Court).
**** Surreptitious DNA collecting[edit] ****
Police forces may collect DNA samples without a suspect's knowledge, and use it
as evidence. The legality of the practice has been questioned in Australia.[74]
In the United States, it has been accepted, courts often ruling that there is
no expectation_of_privacy, citing California_v._Greenwood (1988), in which the
Supreme_Court held that the Fourth_Amendment does not prohibit the warrantless
search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a
home. Critics of this practice underline that this analogy ignores that "most
people have no idea that they risk surrendering their genetic identity to the
police by, for instance, failing to destroy a used coffee cup. Moreover, even
if they do realize it, there is no way to avoid abandoning one's DNA in
public."[75]
The United States Supreme Court ruled in Maryland_v._King (2013) that DNA
sampling of prisoners arrested for serious crimes is constitutional.[76][77]
[78]
In the UK, the Human_Tissue_Act_2004 prohibits private individuals from
covertly collecting biological samples (hair, fingernails, etc.) for DNA
analysis, but exempts medical and criminal investigations from the prohibition.
[79]
**** England and Wales[edit] ****
Evidence from an expert who has compared DNA samples must be accompanied by
evidence as to the sources of the samples and the procedures for obtaining the
DNA profiles.[80] The judge must ensure that the jury must understand the
significance of DNA matches and mismatches in the profiles. The judge must also
ensure that the jury does not confuse the match probability (the probability
that a person that is chosen at random has a matching DNA profile to the sample
from the scene) with the probability that a person with matching DNA committed
the crime. In 1996 R v. Doheny[81] Phillips LJ gave this example of a summing
up, which should be carefully tailored to the particular facts in each case:
     Members of the Jury, if you accept the scientific evidence called by
     the Crown, this indicates that there are probably only four or five
     white males in the United Kingdom from whom that semen stain could
     have come. The Defendant is one of them. If that is the position, the
     decision you have to reach, on all the evidence, is whether you are
     sure that it was the Defendant who left that stain or whether it is
     possible that it was one of that other small group of men who share
     the same DNA characteristics.
Juries should weigh up conflicting and corroborative evidence, using their own
common sense and not by using mathematical formulae, such as Bayes'_theorem, so
as to avoid "confusion, misunderstanding and misjudgment".[82]
*** Presentation and evaluation of evidence of partial or incomplete DNA
profiles[edit] ***
In R v Bates,[83] Moore-Bick LJ said:
     We can see no reason why partial profile DNA evidence should not be
     admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent
     limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to
     evaluate it. There may be cases where the match probability in
     relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would
     consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the
     evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no
     new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by
     case basis. However, the fact that there exists in the case of all
     partial profile evidence the possibility that a "missing" allele
     might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient
     grounds for rejecting such evidence. In many there is a possibility
     (at least in theory) that evidence that would assist the accused and
     perhaps even exculpate him altogether exists, but that does not
     provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and
     otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that
     the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate
     that evidence properly.[84]
**** DNA testing in the United States[edit] ****
CBP chemist reads a DNA profile to determine the origin of a commodity.
There are state laws on DNA profiling in all 50 states of the United_States.
[85] Detailed information on database laws in each state can be found at the
National_Conference_of_State_Legislatures website.[86]
**** Development of artificial DNA[edit] ****
In August 2009, scientists in Israel raised serious doubts concerning the use
of DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper
published in the journal Forensic Science International: Genetics, the Israeli
researchers demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture DNA in a
laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and
blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the
supposed donor of the blood and saliva.[87]
The researchers also showed that, using a DNA database, it is possible to take
information from a profile and manufacture DNA to match it, and that this can
be done without access to any actual DNA from the person whose DNA they are
duplicating. The synthetic DNA oligos required for the procedure are common in
molecular laboratories.[87]
The_New_York_Times quoted the lead author, Daniel Frumkin, saying, "You can
just engineer a crime scene ... any biology undergraduate could perform this".
[87] Frumkin perfected a test that can differentiate real DNA samples from fake
ones. His test detects epigenetic modifications, in particular, DNA
methylation.[88] Seventy percent of the DNA in any human genome is methylated,
meaning it contains methyl_group modifications within a CpG_dinucleotide
context. Methylation at the promoter region is associated with gene silencing.
The synthetic DNA lacks this epigenetic modification, which allows the test to
distinguish manufactured DNA from genuine DNA.[87]
It is unknown how many police departments, if any, currently use the test. No
police lab has publicly announced that it is using the new test to verify DNA
results.[89]
**** Cases[edit] ****
    * In 1986, Richard Buckland was exonerated, despite having admitted to the
      rape and murder of a teenager near Leicester, the city where DNA
      profiling was first developed. This was the first use of DNA
      fingerprinting in a criminal investigation, and the first to prove a
      suspect's innocence.[90] The following year Colin_Pitchfork was
      identified as the perpetrator of the same murder, in addition to another,
      using the same techniques that had cleared Buckland.[91]
    * In 1987, genetic fingerprinting was used in criminal court for the first
      time in the trial of a man accused of unlawful intercourse with a
      mentally handicapped 14-year-old female who gave birth to a baby.[92]
    * In 1987, Florida rapist Tommie Lee Andrews was the first person in the
      United States to be convicted as a result of DNA evidence, for raping a
      woman during a burglary; he was convicted on November 6, 1987, and
      sentenced to 22 years in prison.[93][94]
    * In 1988, Timothy_Wilson_Spencer was the first man in Virginia to be
      sentenced to death through DNA testing, for several rape and murder
      charges. He was dubbed "The South Side Strangler" because he killed
      victims on the south side of Richmond, Virginia. He was later charged
      with rape and first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. He was
      executed on April 27, 1994. David Vasquez, initially convicted of one of
      Spencer's crimes, became the first man in America exonerated based on DNA
      evidence.
    * In 1989, Chicago man Gary_Dotson was the first person whose conviction
      was overturned using DNA evidence.
    * In 1991, Allan_Legere was the first Canadian to be convicted as a result
      of DNA evidence, for four murders he had committed while an escaped
      prisoner in 1989. During his trial, his defense argued that the
      relatively shallow gene pool of the region could lead to false positives.
    * In 1992, DNA evidence was used to prove that Nazi doctor Josef_Mengele
      was buried in Brazil under the name Wolfgang Gerhard.
    * In 1992, DNA from a palo verde tree was used to convict Mark Alan Bogan
      of murder. DNA from seed pods of a tree at the crime scene was found to
      match that of seed pods found in Bogan's truck. This is the first
      instance of plant DNA admitted in a criminal case.[95][96][97]
    * In 1993, Kirk_Bloodsworth was the first person to have been convicted of
      murder and sentenced_to_death, whose conviction was overturned using DNA
      evidence.
    * The 1993 rape and murder of Mia_Zapata, lead singer for the Seattle punk
      band The_Gits, was unsolved nine years after the murder. A database
      search in 2001 failed, but the killer's DNA was collected when he was
      arrested in Florida for burglary and domestic abuse in 2002.
    * The science was made famous in the United_States in 1994 when prosecutors
      heavily relied on DNA evidence allegedly linking O._J._Simpson to a
      double_murder. The case also brought to light the laboratory difficulties
      and handling procedure mishaps that can cause such evidence to be
      significantly doubted.
    * In 1994, Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police (RCMP) detectives successfully
      tested hairs from a cat known as Snowball, and used the test to link a
      man to the murder of his wife, thus marking for the first time in
      forensic history the use of non-human animal DNA to identify a criminal
      (plant DNA was used in 1992, see above).
    * In 1994, the claim that Anna_Anderson was Grand_Duchess_Anastasia
      Nikolaevna_of_Russia was tested after her death using samples of her
      tissue that had been stored at a Charlottesville, Virginia hospital
      following a medical procedure. The tissue was tested using DNA
      fingerprinting, and showed that she bore no relation to the Romanovs.[98]
    * In 1994, Earl_Washington,_Jr., of Virginia had his death sentence
      commuted to life imprisonment a week before his scheduled execution date
      based on DNA evidence. He received a full pardon in 2000 based on more
      advanced testing.[99] His case is often cited by opponents of the death
      penalty.
    * In 1995, the British Forensic_Science_Service carried out its first mass
      intelligence DNA screening in the investigation of the Naomi_Smith murder
      case.
    * In 1998, Richard_J._Schmidt was convicted of attempted second-degree
      murder when it was shown that there was a link between the viral_DNA of
      the human_immunodeficiency_virus (HIV) he had been accused of injecting
      in his girlfriend and viral DNA from one of his patients with AIDS. This
      was the first time viral DNA fingerprinting had been used as evidence in
      a criminal trial.
    * In 1999, Raymond Easton, a disabled man from Swindon, England, was
      arrested and detained for seven hours in connection with a burglary. He
      was released due to an inaccurate DNA match. His DNA had been retained on
      file after an unrelated domestic incident some time previously.[100]
    * In 2000 Frank Lee Smith was proved innocent by DNA profiling of the
      murder of an eight-year-old girl after spending 14 years on death row in
      Florida, USA. However he had died of cancer just before his innocence was
      proven.[101] In view of this the Florida state governor ordered that in
      future any death row inmate claiming innocence should have DNA testing.
      [99]
    * In May 2000 Gordon Graham murdered Paul Gault at his home in Lisburn,
      Northern Ireland. Graham was convicted of the murder when his DNA was
      found on a sports bag left in the house as part of an elaborate ploy to
      suggest the murder occurred after a burglary had gone wrong. Graham was
      having an affair with the victim's wife at the time of the murder. It was
      the first time Low Copy Number DNA was used in Northern Ireland.[102]
    * In 2001, Wayne Butler was convicted for the murder of Celia_Douty. It was
      the first murder in Australia to be solved using DNA profiling.[103][104]
    * In 2002, the body of James_Hanratty, hanged in 1962 for the "A6 murder",
      was exhumed and DNA samples from the body and members of his family were
      analysed. The results convinced Court_of_Appeal judges that Hanratty's
      guilt, which had been strenuously disputed by campaigners, was proved
      "beyond doubt".[105] Paul Foot and some other campaigners continued to
      believe in Hanratty's innocence and argued that the DNA evidence could
      have been contaminated, noting that the small DNA samples from items of
      clothing, kept in a police laboratory for over 40 years "in conditions
      that do not satisfy modern evidential standards", had had to be subjected
      to very new amplification techniques in order to yield any genetic
      profile.[106] However, no DNA other than Hanratty's was found on the
      evidence tested, contrary to what would have been expected had the
      evidence indeed been contaminated.[107]
    * In 2002, DNA testing was used to exonerate Douglas_Echols, a man who was
      wrongfully convicted in a 1986 rape case. Echols was the 114th person to
      be exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing.
    * In August 2002, Annalisa Vincenzi was shot dead in Tuscany. Bartender
      Peter Hamkin, 23, was arrested, in Merseyside in March 2003 on an
      extradition warrant heard at Bow_Street_Magistrates'_Court in London to
      establish whether he should be taken to Italy to face a murder charge.
      DNA "proved" he shot her, but he was cleared on other evidence.[108]
    * In 2003, Welshman Jeffrey Gafoor was convicted of the 1988 murder_of
      Lynette_White, when crime scene evidence collected 12 years earlier was
      re-examined using STR techniques, resulting in a match with his nephew.
      [109] This may be the first known example of the DNA of an innocent yet
      related individual being used to identify the actual criminal, via
      "familial searching".
    * In March 2003, Josiah Sutton was released from prison after serving four
      years of a twelve-year sentence for a sexual assault charge. Questionable
      DNA samples taken from Sutton were retested in the wake of the Houston
      Police_Department's crime lab scandal of mishandling DNA evidence.
    * In June 2003, because of new DNA evidence, Dennis Halstead, John Kogut
      and John Restivo won a re-trial on their murder conviction, their
      convictions were struck down and they were released.[110] The three men
      had already served eighteen years of their thirty-plus-year sentences.
    * The trial of Robert_Pickton (convicted in December 2003) is notable in
      that DNA evidence is being used primarily to identify the victims, and in
      many cases to prove their existence.
    * In 2004, DNA testing shed new light into the mysterious 1912
      disappearance of Bobby_Dunbar, a four-year-old boy who vanished during a
      fishing trip. He was allegedly found alive eight months later in the
      custody of William Cantwell Walters, but another woman claimed that the
      boy was her son, Bruce Anderson, whom she had entrusted in Walters'
      custody. The courts disbelieved her claim and convicted Walters for the
      kidnapping. The boy was raised and known as Bobby Dunbar throughout the
      rest of his life. However, DNA tests on Dunbar's son and nephew revealed
      the two were not related, thus establishing that the boy found in 1912
      was not Bobby Dunbar, whose real fate remains unknown.[111]
    * In 2005, Gary Leiterman was convicted of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a
      law student at the University_of_Michigan, after DNA found on Mixer's
      pantyhose was matched to Leiterman. DNA in a drop of blood on Mixer's
      hand was matched to John Ruelas, who was only four years old in 1969 and
      was never successfully connected to the case in any other way.
      Leiterman's defense unsuccessfully argued that the unexplained match of
      the blood spot to Ruelas pointed to cross-contamination and raised doubts
      about the reliability of the lab's identification of Leiterman.[112][113]
      [114]
    * In December 2005, Evan Simmons was proven innocent of a 1981 attack on an
      Atlanta woman after serving twenty-four years in prison. Mr. Clark is the
      164th person in the United States and the fifth in Georgia to be freed
      using post-conviction DNA testing.
    * In November 2008, Anthony_Curcio was arrested for masterminding one of
      the most elaborately planned armored car heists in history. DNA evidence
      linked Curcio to the crime.[115]
    * In March 2009, Sean_Hodgsonâconvicted of 1979 killing of Teresa De
      Simone, 22, in her car in Southamptonâwas released after tests proved
      DNA from the scene was not his. It was later matched to DNA retrieved
      from the exhumed body of David Lace. Lace had previously confessed to the
      crime but was not believed by the detectives. He served time in prison
      for other crimes committed at the same time as the murder and then
      committed suicide in 1988.[116]
    * In 2012, familial DNA profiling led to Alice Collins Plebuch's unexpected
      discovery that her ancestral bloodline was not purely Irish, as she had
      previously been led to believe, but that her heritage also contained
      European Jewish, Middle Eastern and Eastern European. This led her into
      an extensive genealogy investigation which resulted in her uncovering the
      genetic family of her adopted father.[117][118]
    * In 2016 Anthea Ring, abandoned as baby, was able to use a DNA sample and
      DNA matching database to discover her deceased mother's identity and
      roots in County Mayo, Ireland. A recently developed forensic test was
      subsequently used to capture DNA from saliva left on old stamps and
      envelopes by her suspected father, uncovered through painstaking
      genealogy research. The DNA in the first three samples was too degraded
      to use. However, on the fourth, more than enough DNA was found. The test,
      which has a degree of accuracy acceptable in UK courts, proved that a man
      named Patrick Coyne was her biological father.[119][120]
    * In 2018 the_Buckskin_girl (a body found in 1981 in Ohio) was identified
      as Marcia King from Arkansas using DNA genealogical techniques[121]
    * In 2018 Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested as the main suspect for the
      Golden_State_Killer using DNA and genealogy techniques.[122]
    * In 2018 William Earl Talbott II was arrested as a suspect for the 1987
      murder_of_Jay_Cook_and_Tanya_Van_Cuylenborg with the assistance of DNA
      genealogical techniques. The same genetic genealogist that helped in this
      case also helped police with 18 other arrests in 2018.[123]
