A general representation of the hybridoma method used to produce monoclonal
antibodies.
Hybridoma technology is a method for producing large numbers of identical
antibodies (also called monoclonal_antibodies). This process starts by
injecting a mouse (or other mammal) with an antigen that provokes an immune
response. A type of white blood cell, the B_cell, produces antibodies that bind
to the injected antigen. These antibody producing B-cells are then harvested
from the mouse and, in turn, fused with immortal B cell cancer cells, a
myeloma,[clarification_needed] to produce a hybrid cell_line called a
hybridoma, which has both the antibody-producing ability of the B-cell and the
exaggerated longevity and reproductivity of the myeloma. The hybridomas can be
grown in culture, each culture starting with one viable hybridoma cell,
producing cultures each of which consists of genetically identical hybridomas
which produce one antibody per culture (monoclonal) rather than mixtures of
different antibodies (polyclonal). The myeloma cell line that is used in this
process is selected for its ability to grow in tissue_culture and for an
absence of antibody synthesis. In contrast to polyclonal_antibodies, which are
mixtures of many different antibody molecules, the monoclonal antibodies
produced by each hybridoma line are all chemically identical.
The production of monoclonal antibodies was invented by CÃ©sar_Milstein and
Georges_J._F._KÃ¶hler in 1975. They shared the Nobel Prize of 1984 for Medicine
and Physiology with Niels_Kaj_Jerne, who made other contributions to
immunology. The term hybridoma was coined by Leonard_Herzenberg during his
sabbatical in CÃ©sar_Milstein's laboratory in 1976â1977.[1]

Hybridoma cells grown in tissue culture. The image shows a single clone of
cells each of which is producing large amounts of a specific monoclonal
antibody which the cells secrete and which can be readily purified from the
culture media.
Laboratory animals (mammals, e.g. mice) are first exposed to the antigen that
an antibody is to be generated against. Usually this is done by a series of
injections of the antigen in question, over the course of several weeks. These
injections are typically followed by the use of in vivo electroporation, which
significantly enhances the immune response. Once splenocytes are isolated from
the mammal's spleen, the B cells are fused with immortalised myeloma cells. The
fusion of the B cells with myeloma cells can be done using electrofusion.
Electrofusion causes the B cells and myeloma cells to align and fuse with the
application of an electric field. Alternatively, the B-cells and myelomas can
be made to fuse by chemical protocols, most often using polyethylene_glycol.
The myeloma cells are selected beforehand to ensure they are not secreting
antibody themselves and that they lack the hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) gene, making them sensitive to the HAT_medium
(see below).
Fused cells are incubated in HAT medium (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine
medium) for roughly 10 to 14 days. Aminopterin blocks the pathway that allows
for nucleotide synthesis. Hence, unfused myeloma cells die, as they cannot
produce nucleotides by the de_novo or salvage_pathways because they lack HGPRT.
Removal of the unfused myeloma cells is necessary because they have the
potential to outgrow other cells, especially weakly established hybridomas.
Unfused B cells die as they have a short life span. In this way, only the B
cell-myeloma hybrids survive, since the HGPRT gene coming from the B cells is
functional. These cells produce antibodies (a property of B cells) and are
immortal (a property of myeloma cells). The incubated medium is then diluted
into multi-well plates to such an extent that each well contains only one cell.
Since the antibodies in a well are produced by the same B cell, they will be
directed towards the same epitope, and are thus monoclonal antibodies.
The next stage is a rapid primary screening process, which identifies and
selects only those hybridomas that produce antibodies of appropriate
specificity. The first screening technique used is called ELISA. The hybridoma
culture supernatant, secondary enzyme labeled conjugate, and chromogenic
substrate, are then incubated, and the formation of a colored product indicates
a positive hybridoma. Alternatively, immunocytochemical screening can also be
used.[2]
The B cell that produces the desired antibodies can be cloned to produce many
identical daughter clones. Supplemental media containing interleukin-6 (such as
briclone) are essential for this step. Once a hybridoma colony is established,
it will continually grow in culture medium like RPMI-1640 (with antibiotics and
fetal bovine serum) and produce antibodies.[2]
Multiwell plates are used initially to grow the hybridomas, and after
selection, are changed to larger tissue culture flasks. This maintains the
well-being of the hybridomas and provides enough cells for cryopreservation and
supernatant for subsequent investigations. The culture supernatant can yield 1
to 60 Âµg/ml of monoclonal antibody, which is maintained at -20 Â°C or lower
until required.[2]
By using culture supernatant or a purified immunoglobulin preparation, further
analysis of a potential monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma can be made in
terms of reactivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity.[2]
***** Applications[edit] *****
The use of monoclonal antibodies is numerous and includes the prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of disease. For example, monoclonal antibodies can
distinguish subsets of B cells and T_cells, which is helpful in identifying
different types of leukaemias. In addition, specific monoclonal antibodies have
been used to define cell_surface_markers on white_blood_cells and other cell
types. This led to the cluster_of_differentiation series of markers. These are
often referred to as CD markers and define several hundred different cell
surface components of cells, each specified by binding of a particular
monoclonal antibody. Such antibodies are extremely useful for fluorescence-
activated_cell_sorting, the specific isolation of particular types of cells.
**** In diagnostic histopathology[edit] ****
With the help of monoclonal antibodies, tissues and organs can be classified
based on their expression of certain defined markers, which reflect tissue or
cellular genesis. Prostate_specific_antigen, placental_alkaline_phosphatase,
human_chorionic_gonadotrophin, Î±-fetoprotein and others are organ-associated
antigens and the production of monoclonal antibodies against these antigens
helps in determining the nature of a primary tumor.[2]
Monoclonal antibodies are especially useful in distinguishing morphologically
similar lesions, like pleural and peritoneal_mesothelioma, adenocarcinoma, and
in the determination of the organ or tissue origin of undifferentiated
metastases. Selected monoclonal antibodies help in the detection of occult
metastases (cancer_of_unknown_primary_origin) by immuno-cytological analysis of
bone marrow, other tissue aspirates, as well as lymph nodes and other tissues
and can have increased sensitivity over normal histopathological_staining.[2]
One study[3] performed a sensitive immuno-histochemical assay on bone_marrow
aspirates of 20 patients with localized prostate cancer. Three monoclonal
antibodies (T16, C26, and AE-1), capable of recognizing membrane and
cytoskeletal antigens expressed by epithelial cells to detect tumour cells,
were used in the assay. Bone marrow aspirates of 22% of patients with localized
prostate cancer (stage B, 0/5; Stage C, 2/4), and 36% patients with metastatic
prostate cancer (Stage D1, 0/7 patients; Stage D2, 4/4 patients) had antigen-
positive cells in their bone marrow. It was concluded that immuno-histochemical
staining of bone marrow aspirates are very useful to detect occult bone marrow
metastases in patients with apparently localized prostate cancer.
Although immuno-cytochemistry using tumor-associated monoclonal antibodies has
led to an improved ability to detect occult breast_cancer cells in bone marrow
aspirates and peripheral blood, further development of this method is necessary
before it can be used routinely.[4] One major drawback of immuno-cytochemistry
is that only tumor-associated and not tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies are
used, and as a result, some cross-reaction with normal cells can occur.[5]
In order to effectively stage breast cancer and assess the efficacy of purging
regimens prior to autologous stem cell infusion, it is important to detect even
small quantities of breast cancer cells. Immuno-histochemical methods are ideal
for this purpose because they are simple, sensitive, and quite specific.
Franklin et al.[6] performed a sensitive immuno-cytochemical assay by using a
combination of four monoclonal antibodies (260F9, 520C9, 317G5 and BrE-3)
against tumor cell surface glycoproteins to identify breast tumour cells in
bone marrow and peripheral blood. They concluded from the results that immuno-
cytochemical staining of bone marrow and peripheral_blood is a sensitive and
simple way to detect and quantify breast cancer cells.
One of the main reasons for metastatic_relapse in patients with solid_tumours
is the early dissemination of malignant cells. The use of monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) specific for cytokeratins can identify disseminated individual
epithelial tumor cells in the bone marrow.
One study[7] reports on having developed an immuno-cytochemical procedure for
simultaneous labeling of cytokeratin component no. 18 (CK18) and prostate
specific_antigen (PSA). This would help in the further characterization of
disseminated individual epithelial tumor cells in patients with prostate
cancer. The twelve control aspirates from patients with benign prostatic
hypertrophy showed negative staining, which further supports the specificity of
CK18 in detecting epithelial tumour cells in bone marrow.
In most cases of malignant disease complicated by effusion, neoplastic_cells
can be easily recognized. However, in some cases, malignant cells are not so
easily seen or their presence is too doubtful to call it a positive report. The
use of immuno-cytochemical techniques increases diagnostic accuracy in these
cases.
Ghosh, Mason and Spriggs[8] analysed 53 samples of pleural or peritoneal fluid
from 41 patients with malignant disease. Conventional cytological examination
had not revealed any neoplastic cells. Three monoclonal antibodies (anti-CEA,
Ca 1 and HMFG-2) were used to search for malignant cells. Immunocytochemical
labelling was performed on unstained smears, which had been stored at -20 Â°C
up to 18 months. Twelve of the forty-one cases in which immuno-cytochemical
staining was performed, revealed malignant cells. The result represented an
increase in diagnostic_accuracy of approximately 20%. The study concluded that
in patients with suspected malignant disease, immuno-cytochemical labeling
should be used routinely in the examination of cytologically negative samples
and has important implications with respect to patient management.
Another application of immuno-cytochemical staining is for the detection of two
antigens in the same smear. Double staining with light chain antibodies and
with T and B cell markers can indicate the neoplastic origin of a lymphoma.[9]
One study has reported the isolation of a hybridoma cell line (clone 1E10),
which produces a monoclonal antibody (IgM, k isotype). This monoclonal antibody
shows specific immuno-cytochemical staining of nucleoli.[10]
Tissues and tumours can be classified based on their expression of certain
markers, with the help of monoclonal antibodies. They help in distinguishing
morphologically similar lesions and in determining the organ or tissue origin
of undifferentiated metastases. Immuno-cytological analysis of bone marrow,
tissue aspirates, lymph nodes etc. with selected monoclonal antibodies help in
the detection of occult metastases. Monoclonal antibodies increase the
sensitivity in detecting even small quantities of invasive or metastatic cells.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for cytokeratins can detect disseminated
individual epithelial tumour cells in the bone marrow.
