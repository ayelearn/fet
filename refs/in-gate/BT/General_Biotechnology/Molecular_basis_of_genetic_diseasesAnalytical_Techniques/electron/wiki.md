The electron is a subatomic_particle, symbol
e−
 or
β−
, whose electric_charge is negative one elementary_charge.[8] Electrons belong
to the first generation of the lepton particle family,[9] and are generally
thought to be elementary_particles because they have no known components or
substructure.[1] The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of
the proton.[10] Quantum_mechanical properties of the electron include an
intrinsic angular_momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units
of the reduced_Planck_constant, Ä§. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy
the same quantum_state, in accordance with the Pauli_exclusion_principle.[9]
Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both_particles
and_waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like
light. The wave_properties_of_electrons are easier to observe with experiments
than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have
a lower mass and hence a longer de_Broglie_wavelength for a given energy.
Electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as
electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal_conductivity, and they also
participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions.[11] Since
an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric_field, and if that
electron is moving relative to an observer, said observer will observe it to
generate a magnetic_field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources
will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz_force_law.
Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are
accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual
electrons as well as electron_plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields.
Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are
involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode_ray_tubes,
electron_microscopes, radiation_therapy, lasers, gaseous_ionization_detectors
and particle_accelerators.
Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest
in fields such as chemistry and nuclear_physics. The Coulomb_force interaction
between the positive protons within atomic_nuclei and the negative electrons
without, allows the composition of the two known as atoms. Ionization or
differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei
changes the binding_energy of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the
electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical_bonding.[12]
In 1838, British natural philosopher Richard_Laming first hypothesized the
concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the chemical
properties of atoms.[3] Irish physicist George_Johnstone_Stoney named this
charge 'electron' in 1891, and J._J._Thomson and his team of British physicists
identified it as a particle in 1897.[5] Electrons can also participate in
nuclear_reactions, such as nucleosynthesis_in_stars, where they are known as
beta_particles. Electrons can be created through beta_decay of radioactive
isotopes and in high-energy collisions, for instance when cosmic_rays enter the
atmosphere. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron; it is
identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other charges
of the opposite sign. When an electron_collides_with_a_positron, both particles
can be annihilated, producing gamma_ray photons.

**** Discovery of effect of electric force[edit] ****
The ancient_Greeks noticed that amber attracted small objects when rubbed with
fur. Along with lightning, this phenomenon is one of humanity's earliest
recorded experiences with electricity.[13] In his 1600 treatise De_Magnete, the
English scientist William_Gilbert coined the New_Latin term electrica, to refer
to those substances with property similar to that of amber which attract small
objects after being rubbed.[14] Both electric and electricity are derived from
the Latin Älectrum (also the root of the alloy_of_the_same_name), which came
from the Greek word for amber, á¼¤Î»ÎµÎºÏÏÎ¿Î½ (Älektron).
**** Discovery of two kinds of charges[edit] ****
In the early 1700s, French chemist Charles_FranÃ§ois_du_Fay found that if a
charged gold-leaf is repulsed by glass rubbed with silk, then the same charged
gold-leaf is attracted by amber rubbed with wool. From this and other results
of similar types of experiments, du Fay concluded that electricity consists of
two electrical_fluids, vitreous fluid from glass rubbed with silk and resinous
fluid from amber rubbed with wool. These two fluids can neutralize each other
when combined.[14][15] American scientist Ebenezer_Kinnersley later also
independently reached the same conclusion.[16]:118 A decade later Benjamin
Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical
fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He
gave them the modern charge nomenclature of positive and negative respectively.
[17] Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not
correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and
which situation was a deficit.[18]
Between 1838 and 1851, British natural philosopher Richard_Laming developed the
idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic
particles that had unit electric_charges.[2] Beginning in 1846, German
physicist William_Weber theorized that electricity was composed of positively
and negatively charged fluids, and their interaction was governed by the
inverse_square_law. After studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in 1874,
Irish physicist George_Johnstone_Stoney suggested that there existed a "single
definite quantity of electricity", the charge of a monovalent ion. He was able
to estimate the value of this elementary charge e by means of Faraday's_laws_of
electrolysis.[19] However, Stoney believed these charges were permanently
attached to atoms and could not be removed. In 1881, German physicist Hermann
von_Helmholtz argued that both positive and negative charges were divided into
elementary parts, each of which "behaves like atoms of electricity".[3]
Stoney initially coined the term electrolion in 1881. Ten years later, he
switched to electron to describe these elementary charges, writing in 1894:
"... an estimate was made of the actual amount of this most remarkable
fundamental unit of electricity, for which I have since ventured to suggest the
name electron". A 1906 proposal to change to electrion failed because Hendrik
Lorentz preferred to keep electron.[20][21] The word electron is a combination
of the words electric and ion.[22] The suffix -on which is now used to
designate other subatomic particles, such as a proton or neutron, is in turn
derived from electron.[23][24]
**** Discovery of free electrons outside matter[edit] ****
[A_round_glass_vacuum_tube_with_a_glowing_circular_beam_inside]
A beam of electrons deflected in a circle by a magnetic field[25]
The discovery of electron by Joseph Thomson was closely tied with the
experimental and theoretical research of cathode rays for decades by many
physicists.[3] While studying electrical conductivity in rarefied gases in
1859, The German physicist Julius_Plucker observed that the phosphorescent
light, which was caused by radiation emitted from the cathode, appeared at the
tube wall near the cathode, and the region of the phosphorescent light could be
moved by application of a magnetic field. In 1869, Plucker's student Johann
Wilhelm_Hittorf found that a solid body placed in between the cathode and the
phosphorescence would cast a shadow upon the phosphorescent region of the tube.
Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that
the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls. In 1876,
the German physicist Eugen_Goldstein showed that the rays were emitted
perpendicular to the cathode surface, which distinguished between the rays that
were emitted from the cathode and the incandescent light. Goldstein dubbed the
rays cathode_rays.[26]:393 [27]
During the 1870s, the English chemist and physicist Sir William_Crookes
developed the first cathode ray tube to have a high_vacuum inside.[28] He then
showed in 1874 that the cathode rays can turn a small paddle wheel when placed
in their path. Therefore, he concluded that the rays carried momentum.
Furthermore, by applying a magnetic field, he was able to deflect the rays,
thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively
charged.[27] In 1879, he proposed that these properties could be explained by
regarding cathode rays as composed of negatively charged gaseous molecules in
fourth state of matter in which the mean free path of the particles is so long
that collisions may be ignored.[26]:394â395
The German-born British physicist Arthur_Schuster expanded upon Crookes'
experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and applying
an electric_potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward
the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried
negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of
current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass_ratio of the
ray components. However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand
times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his
calculations at the time.[27]
In 1892 Hendrik_Lorentz suggested that the mass of these particles (electrons)
could be a consequence of their electric charge.[29]
J._J._Thomson
While studying naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist
Henri_Becquerel discovered that they emitted radiation without any exposure to
an external energy source. These radioactive materials became the subject of
much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest
Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles
alpha and beta, on the basis of their ability to penetrate matter.[30] In 1900,
Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an
electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode
rays.[31] This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as
components of atoms.[32][33]
In 1897, the British physicist J._J._Thomson, with his colleagues John_S.
Townsend and H._A._Wilson, performed experiments indicating that cathode rays
really were unique particles, rather than waves, atoms or molecules as was
believed earlier.[5] Thomson made good estimates of both the charge e and the
mass m, finding that cathode ray particles, which he called "corpuscles," had
perhaps one thousandth of the mass of the least massive ion known: hydrogen.[5]
He showed that their charge-to-mass ratio, e/m, was independent of cathode
material. He further showed that the negatively charged particles produced by
radioactive materials, by heated materials and by illuminated materials were
universal.[5][34] The name electron was adopted for these particles by the
scientific community, mainly due to the advocation by G. F. Fitzgerald, J.
Larmor, and H. A. Lorenz.[35]:273
Robert_Millikan
The electron's charge was more carefully measured by the American physicists
Robert_Millikan and Harvey_Fletcher in their oil-drop_experiment of 1909, the
results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field
to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity. This
device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1â150 ions with an
error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by
Thomson's team,[5] using clouds of charged water droplets generated by
electrolysis, and in 1911 by Abram_Ioffe, who independently obtained the same
result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his
results in 1913.[36] However, oil drops were more stable than water drops
because of their slower evaporation rate, and thus more suited to precise
experimentation over longer periods of time.[37]
Around the beginning of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain
conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of
supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles_Wilson used this
principle to devise his cloud_chamber so he could photograph the tracks of
charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.[38]
**** Atomic theory[edit] ****
See also: The_protonâelectron_model_of_the_nucleus
[Three_concentric_circles_about_a_nucleus,_with_an_electron_moving_from_the
second_to_the_first_circle_and_releasing_a_photon]
The Bohr_model_of_the_atom, showing states of electron with energy quantized by
the number n. An electron dropping to a lower orbit emits a photon equal to the
energy difference between the orbits.
By 1914, experiments by physicists Ernest_Rutherford, Henry_Moseley, James
Franck and Gustav_Hertz had largely established the structure of an atom as a
dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons.[39] In
1913, Danish physicist Niels_Bohr postulated that electrons resided in
quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum
of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between
those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific
frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the
spectral_lines of the hydrogen atom.[40] However, Bohr's model failed to
account for the relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was
unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.[39]
Chemical bonds between atoms were explained by Gilbert_Newton_Lewis, who in
1916 proposed that a covalent_bond between two atoms is maintained by a pair of
electrons shared between them.[41] Later, in 1927, Walter_Heitler and Fritz
London gave the full explanation of the electron-pair formation and chemical
bonding in terms of quantum_mechanics.[42] In 1919, the American chemist Irving
Langmuir elaborated on the Lewis' static model of the atom and suggested that
all electrons were distributed in successive "concentric (nearly) spherical
shells, all of equal thickness".[43] In turn, he divided the shells into a
number of cells each of which contained one pair of electrons. With this model
Langmuir was able to qualitatively explain the chemical_properties of all
elements in the periodic table,[42] which were known to largely repeat
themselves according to the periodic_law.[44]
In 1924, Austrian physicist Wolfgang_Pauli observed that the shell-like
structure of the atom could be explained by a set of four parameters that
defined every quantum energy state, as long as each state was occupied by no
more than a single electron. This prohibition against more than one electron
occupying the same quantum energy state became known as the Pauli_exclusion
principle.[45] The physical mechanism to explain the fourth parameter, which
had two distinct possible values, was provided by the Dutch physicists Samuel
Goudsmit and George_Uhlenbeck. In 1925, they suggested that an electron, in
addition to the angular momentum of its orbit, possesses an intrinsic angular
momentum and magnetic_dipole_moment.[39][46] This is analogous to the rotation
of the Earth on its axis as it orbits the Sun. The intrinsic angular momentum
became known as spin, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of
spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is
known as fine_structure splitting.[47]
**** Quantum mechanics[edit] ****
See also: History_of_quantum_mechanics
In his 1924 dissertation Recherches sur la thÃ©orie des quanta (Research on
Quantum Theory), French physicist Louis_de_Broglie hypothesized that all matter
can be represented as a de_Broglie_wave in the manner of light.[48] That is,
under the appropriate conditions, electrons and other matter would show
properties of either particles or waves. The corpuscular_properties of a
particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in
space along its trajectory at any given moment.[49] The wave-like nature of
light is displayed, for example, when a beam of light is passed through
parallel slits thereby creating interference patterns. In 1927 George_Paget
Thomson, discovered the interference effect was produced when a beam of
electrons was passed through thin metal foils and by American physicists
Clinton_Davisson and Lester_Germer by the reflection of electrons from a
crystal of nickel.[50]
[A_symmetrical_blue_cloud_that_decreases_in_intensity_from_the_center_outward]
In quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in an atom is described by an
orbital, which is a probability distribution rather than an orbit. In the
figure, the shading indicates the relative probability to "find" the electron,
having the energy corresponding to the given quantum_numbers, at that point.
De Broglie's prediction of a wave nature for electrons led Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger
to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving under the influence of the
nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the SchrÃ¶dinger_equation,
successfully described how electron waves propagated.[51] Rather than yielding
a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave
equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron
near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in
space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This
approach led to a second formulation of quantum_mechanics (the first by
Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of SchrÃ¶dinger's equation, like
Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a
hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr
in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum.[52] Once spin
and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum
mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms
with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.[53]
In 1928, building on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul_Dirac produced a model of the
electron â the Dirac_equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying
relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the
quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field.[54] In order to resolve some
problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 a model of
the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed
the Dirac_sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the
antimatter counterpart of the electron.[55] This particle was discovered in
1932 by Carl_Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatons and
using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively
charged variants.
In 1947 Willis_Lamb, working in collaboration with graduate student Robert
Retherford, found that certain quantum states of the hydrogen atom, which
should have the same energy, were shifted in relation to each other; the
difference came to be called the Lamb_shift. About the same time, Polykarp
Kusch, working with Henry_M._Foley, discovered the magnetic moment of the
electron is slightly larger than predicted by Dirac's theory. This small
difference was later called anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment of the electron.
This difference was later explained by the theory of quantum_electrodynamics,
developed by Sin-Itiro_Tomonaga, Julian_Schwinger and Richard_Feynman in the
late 1940s.[56]
**** Particle accelerators[edit] ****
With the development of the particle_accelerator during the first half of the
twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of
subatomic_particles.[57] The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons
using electromagnetic_induction was made in 1942 by Donald_Kerst. His initial
betatron reached energies of 2.3 MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved
300 MeV. In 1947, synchrotron_radiation was discovered with a 70 MeV electron
synchrotron at General_Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration
of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.
[58]
With a beam energy of 1.5 GeV, the first high-energy particle collider was
ADONE, which began operations in 1968.[59] This device accelerated electrons
and positrons in opposite directions, effectively doubling the energy of their
collision when compared to striking a static target with an electron.[60] The
Large_ElectronâPositron_Collider (LEP) at CERN, which was operational from
1989 to 2000, achieved collision energies of 209 GeV and made important
measurements for the Standard_Model of particle physics.[61][62]
**** Confinement of individual electrons[edit] ****
Individual electrons can now be easily confined in ultra small (L = 20 nm, W =
20 nm) CMOS transistors operated at cryogenic temperature over a range of
â269 Â°C (4 K) to about â258 Â°C (15 K).[63] The electron wavefunction
spreads in a semiconductor lattice and negligibly interacts with the valence
band electrons, so it can be treated in the single particle formalism, by
replacing its mass with the effective_mass_tensor.
***** Characteristics[edit] *****
**** Classification[edit] ****
[A_table_with_four_rows_and_four_columns,_with_each_cell_containing_a_particle
identifier]
Standard Model of elementary particles. The electron (symbol e) is on the left.
In the Standard_Model of particle physics, electrons belong to the group of
subatomic particles called leptons, which are believed to be fundamental or
elementary_particles. Electrons have the lowest mass of any charged lepton (or
electrically charged particle of any type) and belong to the first-generation
of fundamental particles.[64] The second and third generation contain charged
leptons, the muon and the tau, which are identical to the electron in charge,
spin and interactions, but are more massive. Leptons differ from the other
basic constituent of matter, the quarks, by their lack of strong_interaction.
All members of the lepton group are fermions, because they all have half-odd
integer spin; the electron has spin 1/2.[65]
**** Fundamental properties[edit] ****
The invariant_mass of an electron is approximately 9.109Ã10â31 kilograms,
[66] or 5.489Ã10â4 atomic_mass_units. On the basis of Einstein's principle
of massâenergy_equivalence, this mass corresponds to a rest energy of
0.511 MeV. The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is
about 1836.[10][67] Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron
mass_ratio has held the same value, as is predicted by the Standard Model, for
at least half the age_of_the_universe.[68]
Electrons have an electric_charge of â1.602Ã10â19 coulombs,[66] which is
used as a standard unit of charge for subatomic particles, and is also called
the elementary_charge. This elementary charge has a relative standard
uncertainty of 2.2Ã10â8.[66] Within the limits of experimental accuracy, the
electron charge is identical to the charge of a proton, but with the opposite
sign.[69] As the symbol e is used for the elementary_charge, the electron is
commonly symbolized by
e−
, where the minus sign indicates the negative charge. The positron is
symbolized by
e+
 because it has the same properties as the electron but with a positive rather
than negative charge.[65][66]
The electron has an intrinsic angular_momentum or spin of 1/2.[66] This
property is usually stated by referring to the electron as a spin-1/2 particle.
[65] For such particles the spin magnitude is √3/2 Ä§.[note_3] while the result
of the measurement of a projection of the spin on any axis can only be Â±Ä§/2.
In addition to spin, the electron has an intrinsic magnetic_moment along its
spin axis.[66] It is approximately equal to one Bohr_magneton,[70][note_4]
which is a physical constant equal to 9.27400915(23)Ã10â24 joules per tesla.
[66] The orientation of the spin with respect to the momentum of the electron
defines the property of elementary particles known as helicity.[71]
The electron has no known substructure[1][72] and it is assumed to be a point
particle with a point_charge and no spatial extent.[9]
The issue of the radius of the electron is a challenging problem of the modern
theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the
electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity. On the
other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical
difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.[73]
Observation of a single electron in a Penning_trap suggests the upper limit of
the particle's radius to be 10â22 meters.[74] The upper bound of the electron
radius of 10â18 meters[75] can be derived using the uncertainty_relation in
energy. There is also a physical constant called the "classical_electron
radius", with the much larger value of 2.8179Ã10â15 m, greater than the
radius of the proton. However, the terminology comes from a simplistic
calculation that ignores the effects of quantum_mechanics; in reality, the so-
called classical electron radius has little to do with the true fundamental
structure of the electron.[76][note_5]
There are elementary_particles that spontaneously decay into less massive
particles. An example is the muon, with a mean_lifetime of 2.2Ã10â6 seconds,
which decays into an electron, a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino.
The electron, on the other hand, is thought to be stable on theoretical
grounds: the electron is the least massive particle with non-zero electric
charge, so its decay would violate charge_conservation.[77] The experimental
lower bound for the electron's mean lifetime is 6.6Ã1028 years, at a 90%
confidence_level.[7][78][79]
**** Quantum properties[edit] ****
As with all particles, electrons can act as waves. This is called the
waveâparticle_duality and can be demonstrated using the double-slit
experiment.
The wave-like nature of the electron allows it to pass through two parallel
slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as would be the case for a
classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one
particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the wave
function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (Ï). When the absolute
value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle
will be observed near a locationâa probability_density.[80]:162â218

Example of an antisymmetric wave function for a quantum state of two_identical
fermions_in_a_1-dimensional_box. If the particles swap position, the wave
function inverts its sign.
Electrons are identical_particles because they cannot be distinguished from
each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this
means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions
without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of
fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign
when two electrons are swapped; that is, Ï(r1, r2) = âÏ(r2, r1), where the
variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively.
Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to
equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions
instead.[80]:162â218
In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting
electrons result in a zero_probability that each pair will occupy the same
location or state. This is responsible for the Pauli_exclusion_principle, which
precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This
principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes
groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than
all overlapping each other in the same orbit.[80]:162â218
**** Virtual particles[edit] ****
Main article: Virtual_particle
In a simplified picture, every photon spends some time as a combination of a
virtual electron plus its antiparticle, the virtual positron, which rapidly
annihilate each other shortly thereafter.[81] The combination of the energy
variation needed to create these particles, and the time during which they
exist, fall under the threshold of detectability expressed by the Heisenberg
uncertainty_relation, ÎE Â· Ît â¥ Ä§. In effect, the energy needed to create
these virtual particles, ÎE, can be "borrowed" from the vacuum for a period of
time, Ît, so that their product is no more than the reduced_Planck_constant,
Ä§ â 6.6Ã10â16 eVÂ·s. Thus, for a virtual electron, Ît is at most
1.3Ã10â21 s.[82]

A schematic depiction of virtual electronâpositron pairs appearing at random
near an electron (at lower left)
While an electronâpositron virtual pair is in existence, the coulomb_force
from the ambient electric_field surrounding an electron causes a created
positron to be attracted to the original electron, while a created electron
experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called vacuum_polarization. In
effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric_permittivity more
than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than
its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the
electron.[83][84] This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using
the Japanese TRISTAN particle accelerator.[85] Virtual particles cause a
comparable shielding_effect for the mass of the electron.[86]
The interaction with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%)
deviation of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron from the Bohr
magneton (the anomalous_magnetic_moment).[70][87] The extraordinarily precise
agreement of this predicted difference with the experimentally determined value
is viewed as one of the great achievements of quantum_electrodynamics.[88]
The apparent paradox in classical_physics of a point particle electron having
intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic moment can be explained by the
formation of virtual_photons in the electric field generated by the electron.
These photons cause the electron to shift about in a jittery fashion (known as
zitterbewegung),[89] which results in a net circular motion with precession.
This motion produces both the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron.[9]
[90] In atoms, this creation of virtual photons explains the Lamb_shift
observed in spectral_lines.[83]
**** Interaction[edit] ****
An electron generates an electric field that exerts an attractive force on a
particle with a positive charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a
particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic
approximation is determined by Coulomb's_inverse_square_law.[91]:58â61 When
an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic_field.[80]:140 The AmpÃ¨re-
Maxwell_law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the
current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the
magnetic field that drives an electric_motor.[92] The electromagnetic field of
an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the LiÃ©nardâWiechert
potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of
light (relativistic).[91]:429â434
[A_graph_with_arcs_showing_the_motion_of_charged_particles]
A particle with charge q (at left) is moving with velocity v through a magnetic
field B that is oriented toward the viewer. For an electron, q is negative so
it follows a curved trajectory toward the top.
When an electron is moving through a magnetic field, it is subject to the
Lorentz_force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic
field and the electron velocity. This centripetal_force causes the electron to
follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the
gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to
radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation.[80]:160[93][note_6] The
energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the
AbrahamâLorentzâDirac_Force, which creates a friction that slows the
electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field
upon itself.[94]
[A_curve_shows_the_motion_of_the_electron,_a_red_dot_shows_the_nucleus,_and_a
wiggly_line_the_emitted_photon]
Here, Bremsstrahlung is produced by an electron e deflected by the electric
field of an atomic nucleus. The energy change E2 â E1 determines the
frequency f of the emitted photon.
Photons mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles in quantum
electrodynamics. An isolated electron at a constant velocity cannot emit or
absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation_of_energy and
momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged
particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb
force.[95] Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a
charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in
the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.[96]
An inelastic collision between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron
is called Compton_scattering. This collision results in a transfer of momentum
and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength of the photon
by an amount called the Compton_shift.[note_7] The maximum magnitude of this
wavelength shift is h/mec, which is known as the Compton_wavelength.[97] For an
electron, it has a value of 2.43Ã10â12 m.[66] When the wavelength of the
light is long (for instance, the wavelength of the visible_light is
0.4â0.7 Î¼m) the wavelength shift becomes negligible. Such interaction
between the light and free electrons is called Thomson_scattering or linear
Thomson scattering.[98]
The relative strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two charged
particles, such as an electron and a proton, is given by the fine-structure
constant. This value is a dimensionless quantity formed by the ratio of two
energies: the electrostatic energy of attraction (or repulsion) at a separation
of one Compton wavelength, and the rest energy of the charge. It is given by
Î± â 7.297353Ã10â3, which is approximately equal to 1/137.[66]
When electrons and positrons collide, they annihilate each other, giving rise
to two or more gamma ray photons. If the electron and positron have negligible
momentum, a positronium_atom can form before annihilation results in two or
three gamma ray photons totalling 1.022 MeV.[99][100] On the other hand, a
high-energy photon can transform into an electron and a positron by a process
called pair_production, but only in the presence of a nearby charged particle,
such as a nucleus.[101][102]
In the theory of electroweak_interaction, the left-handed component of
electron's wavefunction forms a weak_isospin doublet with the electron
neutrino. This means that during weak_interactions, electron neutrinos behave
like electrons. Either member of this doublet can undergo a charged_current
interaction by emitting or absorbing a

W
 and be converted into the other member. Charge is conserved during this
reaction because the W boson also carries a charge, canceling out any net
change during the transmutation. Charged current interactions are responsible
for the phenomenon of beta_decay in a radioactive atom. Both the electron and
electron neutrino can undergo a neutral_current interaction via a

Z0
 exchange, and this is responsible for neutrino-electron elastic_scattering.

**** Atoms and molecules[edit] ****
Main article: Atom
[A_table_of_five_rows_and_five_columns,_with_each_cell_portraying_a_color-coded
probability_density]
Probability densities for the first few hydrogen atom orbitals, seen in cross-
section. The energy level of a bound electron determines the orbital it
occupies, and the color reflects the probability of finding the electron at a
given position.
An electron can be bound to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb
force. A system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom.
If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge,
such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is
described by a function called an atomic_orbital. Each orbital has its own set
of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular
momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus.
According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up
to two electrons, which must differ in their spin_quantum_number.
Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption
of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential.[104] Other
methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as
electrons, and the Auger_effect.[105] To escape the atom, the energy of the
electron must be increased above its binding_energy to the atom. This occurs,
for example, with the photoelectric_effect, where an incident photon exceeding
the atom's ionization_energy is absorbed by the electron.[106]
The orbital angular momentum of electrons is quantized. Because the electron is
charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to the
angular momentum. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum
of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The
magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the
electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital
(so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.[107]
The chemical_bond between atoms occurs as a result of electromagnetic
interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics.[108] The strongest
bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms,
allowing the formation of molecules.[12] Within a molecule, electrons move
under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular_orbitals; much as
they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms.[109] A fundamental factor in
these molecular structures is the existence of electron_pairs. These are
electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular
orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms).
Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the
electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that
actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal
probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in
non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.
[110]
**** Conductivity[edit] ****
[Four_bolts_of_lightning_strike_the_ground]
A lightning discharge consists primarily of a flow of electrons.[111] The
electric potential needed for lightning can be generated by a triboelectric
effect.[112][113]
If a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance the positive
charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is
an excess of electrons, the object is said to be negatively charged. When there
are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to
be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons
are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be
electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through
rubbing, by the triboelectric_effect.[114]
Independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in
metals also behave as if they were free. In reality the particles that are
commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-
electronsâquasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and
magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass.[115] When
free electronsâboth in vacuum and metalsâmove, they produce a net_flow of
charge called an electric_current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a
current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are
described mathematically by Maxwell's_equations.[116]
At a given temperature, each material has an electrical_conductivity that
determines the value of electric current when an electric_potential is applied.
Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas
glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons
remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an
insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies
between the extremes of conduction and insulation.[117] On the other hand,
metals have an electronic_band_structure containing partially filled electronic
bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave as if
they were free or delocalized_electrons. These electrons are not associated
with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to
move like a gas (called Fermi_gas)[118] through the material much like free
electrons.
Because of collisions between electrons and atoms, the drift_velocity of
electrons in a conductor is on the order of millimeters per second. However,
the speed at which a change of current at one point in the material causes
changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity_of
propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed.[119] This occurs because
electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the
dielectric_constant of the material.[120]
Metals make relatively good conductors of heat, primarily because the
delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms.
However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is
nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the
WiedemannâFranz_law,[118] which states that the ratio of thermal_conductivity
to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature. The thermal
disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the
material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.[121]
When cooled below a point called the critical_temperature, materials can
undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric
current, in a process known as superconductivity. In BCS_theory, pairs of
electrons called Cooper_pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via
lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms
that normally create electrical resistance.[122] (Cooper pairs have a radius of
roughly 100 nm, so they can overlap each other.)[123] However, the mechanism by
which higher_temperature_superconductors operate remains uncertain.
Electrons inside conducting solids, which are quasi-particles themselves, when
tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute_zero, behave as though they
had split into three other quasiparticles: spinons, orbitons and holons.[124]
[125] The former carries spin and magnetic moment, the next carries its orbital
location while the latter electrical charge.
**** Motion and energy[edit] ****
According to Einstein's theory of special_relativity, as an electron's speed
approaches the speed_of_light, from an observer's point of view its
relativistic_mass increases, thereby making it more and more difficult to
accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an
electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c.
However, when relativistic electronsâthat is, electrons moving at a speed
close to câare injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the
local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily
travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they
generate a faint light called Cherenkov_radiation.[126]
[The_plot_starts_at_zero_and_curves_sharply_upward_toward_the_right]
Lorentz factor as a function of velocity. It starts at value 1 and goes to
infinity as v approaches c.
The effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the Lorentz
factor, defined as      &#x03B3; = 1  /    1 &#x2212;   v  2     /    c  2
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \gamma =1/{\sqrt {1-{v^{2}}/{c^{2}}}}}
[\scriptstyle \gamma =1/{\sqrt {1-{v^{2}}/{c^{2}}}}] where v is the speed of
the particle. The kinetic energy Ke of an electron moving with velocity v is:
           K   e    = ( &#x03B3; &#x2212; 1 )  m   e     c  2   ,
      {\displaystyle \displaystyle K_{\mathrm {e} }=(\gamma -1)m_{\mathrm {e}
      }c^{2},}  [\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {e} }=(\gamma -1)m_{\mathrm {e} }c^
      {2},]
where me is the mass of electron. For example, the Stanford_linear_accelerator
can accelerate an electron to roughly 51 GeV.[127] Since an electron behaves as
a wave, at a given velocity it has a characteristic de_Broglie_wavelength. This
is given by Î»e = h/p where h is the Planck_constant and p is the momentum.[48]
For the 51 GeV electron above, the wavelength is about 2.4Ã10â17 m, small
enough to explore structures well below the size of an atomic nucleus.[128]

Pair_production of an electron and positron, caused by the close approach of a
photon with an atomic nucleus. The lightning symbol represents an exchange of a
virtual photon, thus an electric force acts. The angle between the particles is
very small.[129]
The Big_Bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory to explain
the early stages in the evolution of the Universe.[130] For the first
millisecond of the Big Bang, the temperatures were over 10 billion kelvins and
photons had mean energies over a million electronvolts. These photons were
sufficiently energetic that they could react with each other to form pairs of
electrons and positrons. Likewise, positron-electron pairs annihilated each
other and emitted energetic photons:

An equilibrium between electrons, positrons and photons was maintained during
this phase of the evolution of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed,
however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where
electron-positron formation could occur. Most of the surviving electrons and
positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly
reheated the universe.[131]
For reasons that remain uncertain, during the annihilation process there was an
excess in the number of particles over antiparticles. Hence, about one electron
for every billion electron-positron pairs survived. This excess matched the
excess of protons over antiprotons, in a condition known as baryon_asymmetry,
resulting in a net charge of zero for the universe.[132][133] The surviving
protons and neutrons began to participate in reactions with each otherâin the
process known as nucleosynthesis, forming isotopes of hydrogen and helium, with
trace amounts of lithium. This process peaked after about five minutes.[134]
Any leftover neutrons underwent negative beta_decay with a half-life of about a
thousand seconds, releasing a proton and electron in the process,

For about the next 300000â400000 years, the excess electrons remained too
energetic to bind with atomic_nuclei.[135] What followed is a period known as
recombination, when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe became
transparent to radiation.[136]
Roughly one million years after the big bang, the first generation of stars
began to form.[136] Within a star, stellar_nucleosynthesis results in the
production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei. These antimatter
particles immediately annihilate with electrons, releasing gamma rays. The net
result is a steady reduction in the number of electrons, and a matching
increase in the number of neutrons. However, the process of stellar_evolution
can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes. Selected isotopes can
subsequently undergo negative beta decay, emitting an electron and antineutrino
from the nucleus.[137] An example is the cobalt-60 (60Co) isotope, which decays
to form nickel-60 (60
Ni
).[138]
[A_branching_tree_representing_the_particle_production]
An extended air shower generated by an energetic cosmic ray striking the
Earth's atmosphere
At the end of its lifetime, a star with more than about 20 solar_masses can
undergo gravitational_collapse to form a black_hole.[139] According to
classical_physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational
attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic
radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild_radius. However, quantum
mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking
radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created
at the event_horizon of these stellar_remnants.
When a pair of virtual particles (such as an electron and positron) is created
in the vicinity of the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result
in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum
tunnelling. The gravitational_potential of the black hole can then supply the
energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it
to radiate away into space.[140] In exchange, the other member of the pair is
given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black
hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually
causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.[141]
Cosmic_rays are particles traveling through space with high energies. Energy
events as high as 3.0Ã1020 eV have been recorded.[142] When these particles
collide with nucleons in the Earth's_atmosphere, a shower of particles is
generated, including pions.[143] More than half of the cosmic radiation
observed from the Earth's surface consists of muons. The particle called a muon
is a lepton produced in the upper atmosphere by the decay of a pion.

***** Observation[edit] *****
[A_swirling_green_glow_in_the_night_sky_above_snow-covered_ground]
Aurorae are mostly caused by energetic electrons precipitating into the
atmosphere.[145]
Remote observation of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy.
For example, in high-energy environments such as the corona of a star, free
electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation.
Electron gas can undergo plasma_oscillation, which is waves caused by
synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions
that can be detected by using radio_telescopes.[146]
The frequency of a photon is proportional to its energy. As a bound electron
transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits
photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated
by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption_lines appear in the
spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a
characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen_spectral_series.
Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the
composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.[147][148]
In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be
observed by means of particle_detectors, which allow measurement of specific
properties such as energy, spin and charge.[106] The development of the Paul
trap and Penning_trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small
region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle
properties. For example, in one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a
single electron for a period of 10 months.[149] The magnetic moment of the
electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a
greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.[150]
The first video images of an electron's energy distribution were captured by a
team at Lund_University in Sweden, February 2008. The scientists used extremely
short flashes of light, called attosecond pulses, which allowed an electron's
motion to be observed for the first time.[151][152]
The distribution of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by
angle-resolved_photoemission_spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique employs the
photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal_spaceâa mathematical
representation of periodic structures that is used to infer the original
structure. ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and scattering
of electrons within the material.[153]
***** Plasma applications[edit] *****
**** Particle beams[edit] ****
[A_violet_beam_from_above_produces_a_blue_glow_about_a_Space_shuttle_model]
During a NASA wind_tunnel test, a model of the Space_Shuttle is targeted by a
beam of electrons, simulating the effect of ionizing gases during re-entry.
[154]
Electron_beams are used in welding.[155] They allow energy densities up to
107 WÂ·cmâ2 across a narrow focus diameter of 0.1â1.3 mm and usually
require no filler material. This welding technique must be performed in a
vacuum to prevent the electrons from interacting with the gas before reaching
their target, and it can be used to join conductive materials that would
otherwise be considered unsuitable for welding.[156][157]
Electron-beam_lithography (EBL) is a method of etching semiconductors at
resolutions smaller than a micrometer.[158] This technique is limited by high
costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the
tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the
resolution to about 10 nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used for the
production of small numbers of specialized integrated_circuits.[159]
Electron_beam_processing is used to irradiate materials in order to change
their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products.[160] Electron
beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of
temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation causes
a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its
activation energy.[161]
Linear_particle_accelerators generate electron beams for treatment of
superficial tumors in radiation_therapy. Electron_therapy can treat such skin
lesions as basal-cell_carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a
limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5 cm for electron energies
in the range 5â20 MeV. An electron beam can be used to supplement the
treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X-rays.[162][163]
Particle_accelerators use electric fields to propel electrons and their
antiparticles to high energies. These particles emit synchrotron radiation as
they pass through magnetic fields. The dependency of the intensity of this
radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beamâa process known as the
SokolovâTernov_effect.[note_8] Polarized electron beams can be useful for
various experiments. Synchrotron radiation can also cool the electron beams to
reduce the momentum spread of the particles. Electron and positron beams are
collided upon the particles' accelerating to the required energies; particle
detectors observe the resulting energy emissions, which particle_physics
studies .[164]
**** Imaging[edit] ****
Low-energy_electron_diffraction (LEED) is a method of bombarding a crystalline
material with a collimated_beam of electrons and then observing the resulting
diffraction patterns to determine the structure of the material. The required
energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20â200 eV.[165] The
reflection_high-energy_electron_diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the
reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize
the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range
8â20 keV and the angle of incidence is 1â4Â°.[166][167]
The electron_microscope directs a focused beam of electrons at a specimen. Some
electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and
relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material.
Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce
atomically resolved images of the material.[168] In blue light, conventional
optical_microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200 nm.[169]
By comparison, electron microscopes are limited by the de_Broglie_wavelength of
the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037 nm for electrons
accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential.[170] The Transmission_Electron
Aberration-Corrected_Microscope is capable of sub-0.05 nm resolution, which is
more than enough to resolve individual atoms.[171] This capability makes the
electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging.
However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to
maintain.
Two main types of electron microscopes exist: transmission and scanning.
Transmission electron microscopes function like overhead_projectors, with a
beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by
lenses on a photographic_slide or a charge-coupled_device. Scanning electron
microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the
studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100Ã to
1,000,000Ã or higher for both microscope types. The scanning_tunneling
microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the
studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.

**** Other applications[edit] ****
In the free-electron_laser (FEL), a relativistic_electron_beam passes through a
pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole_magnets whose fields point in
alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that
coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation
field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance
electromagnetic radiation with a wide range of frequencies, from microwaves to
soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in
medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.[175]
Electrons are important in cathode_ray_tubes, which have been extensively used
as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer_monitors and television
sets.[176] In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode
initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse.
[177] Vacuum_tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals,
and they played a critical role in the development of electronics technology.
However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state_devices such as the
transistor.[178]

                 &#x03BC;   B    =    e &#x210F;   2  m   e       .
            {\displaystyle \textstyle \mu _{\mathrm {B} }={\frac {e\hbar }{2m_
            {\mathrm {e} }}}.}  [\textstyle \mu _{\mathrm {B} }={\frac {e\hbar
            }{2m_{\mathrm {e} }}}.]
   6. ^ The classical electron radius is derived as follows. Assume that the
      electron's charge is spread uniformly throughout a spherical volume.
      Since one part of the sphere would repel the other parts, the sphere
      contains electrostatic potential energy. This energy is assumed to equal
      the electron's rest_energy, defined by special_relativity (E = mc2).
      From electrostatics theory, the potential_energy of a sphere with radius
      r and charge e is given by:
                E   p    =    e  2    8 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0   r    ,
            {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {p} }={\frac {e^{2}}{8\pi \varepsilon _
            {0}r}},}  [E_{\mathrm {p} }={\frac {e^{2}}{8\pi \varepsilon _
            {0}r}},]
      where Îµ0 is the vacuum_permittivity. For an electron with rest mass m0,
      the rest energy is equal to:
                 E   p    =  m  0    c  2   ,    {\displaystyle \textstyle E_
            {\mathrm {p} }=m_{0}c^{2},}  [\textstyle E_{\mathrm {p} }=m_{0}c^
            {2},]
      where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Setting them equal and solving
      for r gives the classical electron radius.

   7. ^ Radiation from non-relativistic electrons is sometimes termed cyclotron
      radiation.
   8. ^ The change in wavelength, ÎÎ», depends on the angle of the recoil, Î¸,
      as follows,
                &#x0394; &#x03BB; =   h   m   e    c    ( 1 &#x2212; cos
            &#x2061; &#x03B8; ) ,    {\displaystyle \textstyle \Delta \lambda =
            {\frac {h}{m_{\mathrm {e} }c}}(1-\cos \theta ),}  [\textstyle
            \Delta \lambda ={\frac {h}{m_{\mathrm {e} }c}}(1-\cos \theta ),]
      where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and me is the electron mass.
      See Zombeck (2007: 393, 396).
   9. ^ The polarization of an electron beam means that the spins of all
      electrons point into one direction. In other words, the projections of
      the spins of all electrons onto their momentum vector have the same sign.
