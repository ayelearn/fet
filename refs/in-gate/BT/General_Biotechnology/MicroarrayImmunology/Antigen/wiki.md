An illustration that shows how antigens induce the immune_system response by
interacting with an antibody that matches the antigen's molecular_structure.
In immunology, antigens (Ag) are structures (aka substances) specifically bound
by antibodies (Ab) or a cell surface version of Ab ~ B_cell_antigen_receptor
(BCR). The term antigen originally described a structural molecule that binds
specifically to an antibody only in the form of native antigen. It was expanded
later to refer to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment after processing
the native antigen that can be recognized by T-cell_receptor (TCR). BCR and TCR
are both highly variable antigen receptors diversified by somatic_V(D)J
recombination. Both T_cells and B_cells are cellular components of adaptive
immunity. [1] The Ag abbreviation stands for an antibody generator.[2]
Antigens are "targeted" by antibodies. Each antibody is specifically produced
by the immune system to match an antigen after cells in the immune system come
into contact with it; this allows a precise identification or matching of the
antigen and the initiation of a tailored_response. The antibody is said to
"match" the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it due to an adaptation in
a region_of_the_antibody; because of this, many different antibodies are
produced, each able to bind a different antigen while sharing the same basic
structure. In most cases, an adapted antibody can only react to and bind one
specific antigen; in some instances, however, antibodies may cross-react and
bind more than one antigen.
Also, an antigen is a molecule that binds to Ag-specific receptors, but cannot
necessarily induce an immune response in the body by itself.[3] Antigens are
usually proteins, peptides (amino acid chains) and polysaccharides (chains of
monosaccharides/simple sugars) but lipids and nucleic acids become antigens
only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides.[4] In general,
saccharides and lipids (as opposed to peptides) qualify as antigens but not as
immunogens since they cannot elicit an immune response on their own.
Furthermore, for a peptide to induce an immune response (activation of T-cells
by antigen-presenting_cells) it must be a large enough size, since peptides too
small will also not elicit an immune response.
The antigen may originate from within the body ("self-antigen") or from the
external environment ("non-self"). The immune system is supposed to identify
and attack "non-self" invaders from the outside world or modified/harmful
substances present in the body and usually does not react to self-antigens
under normal homeostatic conditions due to negative_selection of T_cells in the
thymus.[5]
Vaccines are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form, which are
intentionally administered to a recipient to induce the memory function of
adaptive_immune_system toward the antigens of the pathogen invading that
recipient.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
Paul_Ehrlich coined the term antibody (in German AntikÃ¶rper) in his side-chain
theory at the end of the 19th century.[6] In 1899, Ladislas_Deutsch_(Laszlo
Detre) (1874â1939) named the hypothetical substances halfway between
bacterial constituents and antibodies "substances immunogenes ou antigenes"
(antigenic or immunogenic substances). He originally believed those substances
to be precursors of antibodies, just as zymogen is a precursor of an enzyme.
But, by 1903, he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune
bodies (antibodies) and wrote that the word antigen is a contraction of
antisomatogen (ImmunkÃ¶rperbildner). The Oxford_English_Dictionary indicates
that the logical construction should be "anti(body)-gen".[7]
***** Terminology[edit] *****
    * Epitope â The distinct surface features of an antigen, its antigenic
      determinant. Antigenic molecules, normally "large" biological polymers,
      usually present surface features that can act as points of interaction
      for specific antibodies. Any such feature constitutes an epitope. Most
      antigens have the potential to be bound by multiple antibodies, each of
      which is specific to one of the antigen's epitopes. Using the "lock and
      key" metaphor, the antigen can be seen as a string of keys (epitopes)
      each of which matches a different lock (antibody). Different antibody
      idiotypes, each have distinctly formed complementarity_determining
      regions.
    * Allergen â A substance capable of causing an allergic_reaction. The
      (detrimental) reaction may result after exposure via ingestion,
      inhalation, injection, or contact with skin.
    * Superantigen â A class of antigens that cause non-specific activation
      of T-cells, resulting in polyclonal T-cell activation and massive
      cytokine release.
    * Tolerogen â A substance that invokes a specific immune non-
      responsiveness due to its molecular_form. If its molecular form is
      changed, a tolerogen can become an immunogen.
    * Immunoglobulin-binding protein â Proteins such as protein_A, protein_G,
      and protein_L that are capable of binding to antibodies at positions
      outside of the antigen-binding site. While antigens are the "target" of
      antibodies, immunoglobulin-binding proteins "attack" antibodies.
    * T-dependent antigen â Antigens that require the assistance of T cells
      to induce the formation of specific antibodies.
    * T-independent antigen â Antigens that stimulate B cells directly.
    * Immunodominant antigens â Antigens that dominate (over all others from
      a pathogen) in their ability to produce an immune response. T cell
      responses typically are directed against a relatively few immunodominant
      epitopes, although in some cases (e.g., infection with the malaria
      pathogen Plasmodium_spp.) it is dispersed over a relatively large number
      of parasite antigens.[8]
Antigen_presenting_cells present antigens in the form of peptides on
histocompatibility_molecules. The T cell selectively recognize the antigens;
depending on the antigen and the type of the histocompatibility molecule,
different types of T cells will be activated. For T Cell Receptor (TCR)
recognition, the peptide must be processed into small fragments inside the cell
and presented by a major_histocompatibility_complex (MHC).[9] The antigen
cannot elicit the immune response without the help of an immunologic_adjuvant.
[3] Similarly, the adjuvant component of vaccines plays an essential role in
the activation of the innate immune system.[10][11]
An immunogen is an antigen substance (or adduct) that is able to trigger a
humoral (innate) or cell-mediated immune response.[12] It first initiates an
innate immune response, which then causes the activation of the adaptive immune
response. An antigen binds the highly variable immunoreceptor products (B cell
receptor or T cell receptor) once these have been generated. Immunogens are
those antigens, termed immunogenic, capable of inducing an immune response.[13]
At the molecular level, an antigen can be characterized by its ability to bind
to an antibody's variable_Fab_region. Different antibodies have the potential
to discriminate among specific epitopes present on the antigen surface. A
hapten is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope.
In order to induce an immune response, it needs to be attached to a large
carrier molecule such as a protein (a complex of peptides). Antigens are
usually carried by proteins and polysaccharides, and less frequently, lipids.
This includes parts (coats, capsules, cell walls, flagella, fimbriae, and
toxins) of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. Lipids and nucleic
acids are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides.
[citation_needed] Non-microbial non-self antigens can include pollen, egg white
and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of
transfused blood cells.
***** Sources[edit] *****
Antigens can be classified according to their source.
**** Exogenous antigens[edit] ****
Exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside,
for example, by inhalation, ingestion or injection. The immune system's
response to exogenous antigens is often subclinical. By endocytosis or
phagocytosis, exogenous antigens are taken into the antigen-presenting_cells
(APCs) and processed into fragments. APCs then present the fragments to T
helper_cells (CD4+) by the use of class_II_histocompatibility molecules on
their surface. Some T cells are specific for the peptide:MHC complex. They
become activated and start to secrete cytokines, substances that activate
cytotoxic_T_lymphocytes (CTL), antibody-secreting B_cells, macrophages and
other particles.
Some antigens start out as exogenous, and later become endogenous (for example,
intracellular viruses). Intracellular antigens can be returned to circulation
upon the destruction of the infected cell.
**** Endogenous antigens[edit] ****
Endogenous antigens are generated within normal cells as a result of normal
cell metabolism, or because of viral or intracellular bacterial infection. The
fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with MHC_class
I molecules. If activated cytotoxic_CD8+_T_cells recognize them, the T cells
secrete various toxins that cause the lysis or apoptosis of the infected cell.
In order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting
self-proteins, the cytotoxic cells (self-reactive T cells) are deleted as a
result of tolerance (negative selection). Endogenous antigens include xenogenic
(heterologous), autologous and idiotypic or allogenic (homologous) antigens.
Sometimes antigens are part_of_the_host_itself in an autoimmune_disease.[14]
**** Autoantigens[edit] ****
An autoantigen is usually a normal protein or protein complex (and sometimes
DNA or RNA) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from
a specific autoimmune_disease. Under normal conditions, these antigens should
not be the target of the immune system, but in autoimmune diseases, their
associated T cells are not deleted and instead attack.
**** Neoantigens[edit] ****
Neoantigens are those that are entirely absent from the normal human genome. As
compared with nonmutated self-antigens, neoantigens are of relevance to tumor
control, as the quality of the T cell pool that is available for these antigens
is not affected by central T cell tolerance. Technology to systematically
analyze T cell reactivity against neoantigens became available only recently.
[15]
*** Viral antigens[edit] ***
For virus-associated tumors, such as cervical_cancer and a subset of head_and
neck_cancers, epitopes derived from viral open reading frames contribute to the
pool of neoantigens.[15]
*** Tumor antigens[edit] ***
Tumor_antigens are those antigens that are presented by MHC_class_I or MHC
class_II molecules on the surface of tumor_cells. Antigens found only on such
cells are called tumor-specific_antigens (TSAs) and generally result from a
tumor-specific mutation. More common are antigens that are presented by tumor
cells and normal cells, called tumor-associated_antigens (TAAs). Cytotoxic_T
lymphocytes that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy tumor cells.
[15]
Tumor antigens can appear on the surface of the tumor in the form of, for
example, a mutated receptor, in which case they are recognized by B_cells.[15]
For human tumors without a viral etiology, novel peptides (neo-epitopes) are
created by tumor-specific DNA alterations.[15]
** Process[edit] **
A large fraction of human tumor mutations are effectively patient-specific.
Therefore, neoantigens may also be based on individual tumor genomes. Deep-
sequencing technologies can identify mutations within the protein-coding part
of the genome (the exome) and predict potential neoantigens. In mice models,
for all novel protein sequences, potential MHC-binding peptides were predicted.
The resulting set of potential neoantigens was used to assess T cell
reactivity. Exomeâbased analyses were exploited in a clinical setting, to
assess reactivity in patients treated by either tumor-infiltrating_lymphocyte
(TIL) cell therapy or checkpoint blockade. Neoantigen identification was
successful for multiple experimental model systems and human malignancies.[15]
The false-negative rate of cancer exome sequencing is lowâi.e.: the majority
of neoantigens occur within exonic sequence with sufficient coverage. However,
the vast majority of mutations within expressed genes do not produce
neoantigens that are recognized by autologous T cells.[15]
As of 2015 mass spectrometry resolution is insufficient to exclude many false
positives from the pool of peptides that may be presented by MHC molecules.
Instead, algorithms are used to identify the most likely candidates. These
algorithms consider factors such as the likelihood of proteasomal processing,
transport into the endoplasmic_reticulum, affinity for the relevant MHC class I
alleles and gene expression or protein translation levels.[15]
The majority of human neoantigens identified in unbiased screens display a high
predicted MHC binding affinity. Minor histocompatibility antigens, a
conceptually similar antigen class are also correctly identified by MHC binding
algorithms. Another potential filter examines whether the mutation is expected
to improve MHC binding. The nature of the central TCR-exposed residues of MHC-
bound peptides is associated with peptide immunogenicity.[15]
**** Nativity[edit] ****
A native antigen is an antigen that is not yet processed by an APC to smaller
parts. T_cells cannot bind native antigens, but require that they be processed
by APCs, whereas B_cells can be activated by native ones.
***** Antigenic specificity[edit] *****
Antigenic specificity is the ability of the host cells to recognize an antigen
specifically as a unique molecular entity and distinguish it from another with
exquisite precision. Antigen specificity is due primarily to the side-chain
conformations of the antigen. It is measurable and need not be linear or of a
rate-limited step or equation.[16]
