****** Antigen-antibody interaction ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Antigen-antibody interaction, or antigen-antibody reaction, is a specific
chemical interaction between antibodies produced by B_cells of the white_blood
cells and antigens during immune_reaction. It is the fundamental reaction in
the body by which the body is protected from complex foreign molecules, such as
pathogens and their chemical toxins. In the blood, the antigens are
specifically and with high affinity bound by antibodies to form an antigen-
antibody complex. The immune complex is then transported to cellular systems
where it can be destroyed or deactivated.
The first correct description of the antigen-antibody reaction was given by
Richard J. Goldberg at the University of Wisconsin in 1952.[1][2] It came to be
known as "Goldberg's theory" (of antigen-antibody reaction).[3]
There are several types of antibodies and antigens, and each antibody is
capable of binding only to a specific antigen. The specificity of the binding
is due to specific chemical constitution of each antibody. The antigenic
determinant or epitope is recognized by the paratope of the antibody, situated
at the variable region of the polypeptide chain. The variable region in turn
has hyper-variable regions which are unique amino_acid_sequences in each
antibody. Antigens are bound to antibodies through weak and noncovalent
interactions such as electrostatic_interactions, hydrogen_bonds, Van_der_Waals
forces, and hydrophobic_interactions.[4]
The principles of specificity and cross-reactivity of the antigen-antibody
interaction are useful in clinical laboratory for diagnostic purposes. One
basic application is determination of ABO blood group. It is also used as a
molecular technique for infection with different pathogens, such as HIV,
microbes, and helminth parasites.

***** Molecular basis[edit] *****
Immunity developed as an individual is exposed to antigens is called adaptive
or acquired immunity, in contrast to immunity developed at birth, which is
innate immunity. Acquired immunity depends upon the interaction between
antigens and a group of proteins called antibodies produced by B cells of the
blood. There are many antibodies and each is specific for a particular type of
antigen. Thus immune response in acquired immunity is due to the precise
binding of antigens to antibody. Only very small area of the antigens and
antibody molecules actually interact through complimentary binding sites,
called epitopes in antigens and paratopes in antibody.[5]
**** Antibody structure[edit] ****
Structural model of an antibody molecule. Rounded portions indicate antigen
binding sites.
In an antibody, the Fab_(fragment,_antigen-binding)_region is formed from the
amino-terminal end of both the light and heavy chains of the immunoglobulin
polypeptide. This region, called the variable (V) domain, is composed of amino
acid sequences that define each type of antibody and their binding affinity to
an antigen. The combined sequence of variable light chain (VL) and variable
heavy chain (VH) creates three hypervariable regions (HV1, HV2, and HV3). In VL
these are roughly from residues 28 to 35, from 49 to 59, and from 92 to 103,
respectively. HV3 is the most variable part. Thus these regions are the
paratope, the binding site of an antigen. The rest of the V region between the
hypervariable regions are called framework regions. Each V domain has four
framework domains, namely FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4.[4][6]

***** Properties[edit] *****
**** Chemical basis of antigen-antibody interaction[edit] ****
Antibodies bind antigens through weak chemical interactions, and bonding is
essentially non-covalent. Electrostatic_interactions, hydrogen_bonds, van_der
Waals_forces, and hydrophobic_interactions are all known to be involved
depending on the interaction sites.[7][8] Non-covalent bonds between antibody
and antigen can also be mediated by interfacial water molecules. Such indirect
bonds can contribute to the phenomenon of cross-reactivity, i.e. the
recognition of different but related antigens by a single antibody.[9]
**** Affinity of the interaction[edit] ****
Antigen and antibody interact through a high affinity binding much like lock
and key.[10] A dynamic equilibrium exists for the binding. For example, the
reaction is a reversible one, and can be expressed as:
           [ Ab ]  +  [ Ag ]        &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;
      &#x21C0;        [ AbAg ]     {\displaystyle {\ce {[Ab] + [Ag] <=>
      [AbAg]}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {[Ab] + [Ag] <=> [AbAg]}}}]
where [Ab] is the antibody concentration and [Ag] is the antigen concentration,
either in free ([Ab],[Ag]) or bound ([AbAg]) state.
The equilibrium association constant can therefore be represented as:
          K  a   =    k   on     k   off      =     [ AbAg ]     [ Ab ]   [ Ag
      ]       {\displaystyle K_{a}={\frac {k_{{\ce {on}}}}{k_{{\ce {off}}}}}=
      {\frac {{\ce {[AbAg]}}}{{\ce {[Ab][Ag]}}}}}  [{\displaystyle K_{a}={\frac
      {k_{{\ce {on}}}}{k_{{\ce {off}}}}}={\frac {{\ce {[AbAg]}}}{{\ce {[Ab]
      [Ag]}}}}}]
where K is the equilibrium_constant.
Reciprocally the dissociation constant will be:
          K  d   =    k   off     k   on      =     [ Ab ]   [ Ag ]     [ AbAg
      ]       {\displaystyle K_{d}={\frac {k_{{\ce {off}}}}{k_{{\ce {on}}}}}=
      {\frac {{\ce {[Ab][Ag]}}}{{\ce {[AbAg]}}}}}  [{\displaystyle K_{d}={\frac
      {k_{{\ce {off}}}}{k_{{\ce {on}}}}}={\frac {{\ce {[Ab][Ag]}}}{{\ce {
      [AbAg]}}}}}]
However, these equations are applicable only to a single epitope binding, i.e.
one antigen on one antibody. Since the antibody necessarily has two paratopes,
and in many circumstances complex binding occurs, the multiple binding
equilibrium can be summed up as:
          K  a   =    k   on     k   off      =     [ AbAg ]     [ Ab ]   [ Ag
      ]     =   r  c ( n &#x2212; r )      {\displaystyle K_{a}={\frac {k_{{\ce
      {on}}}}{k_{{\ce {off}}}}}={\frac {{\ce {[AbAg]}}}{{\ce {[Ab][Ag]}}}}=
      {\frac {r}{c(n-r)}}}  [{\displaystyle K_{a}={\frac {k_{{\ce {on}}}}{k_{
      {\ce {off}}}}}={\frac {{\ce {[AbAg]}}}{{\ce {[Ab][Ag]}}}}={\frac {r}{c(n-
      r)}}}]
where, at equilibrium, c is the concentration of free ligand, r represents the
ratio of the concentration of bound ligand to total antibody concentration and
n is the maximum number of binding sites per antibody molecule (the antibody
valence).
The overall strength of the binding of an antibody to an antigen is termed its
avidity for that antigen. Since antibodies are bivalent or polyvalent, this is
the sum of the strengths of individual antibody-antigen interactions. The
strength of an individual interaction between a single binding site on an
antibody and its target epitope is termed the affinity of that interaction.
Avidity and affinity can be judged by the dissociation_constant for the
interactions they describe. The lower the dissociation constant, the higher the
avidity or affinity, and the stronger the interaction.
***** Auto immune disease[edit] *****
Normally antibodies can detect and differentiate molecules from outside of the
body and those produced inside the body as a result of cellular activities.
Self molecules as ignored by the immune system. However, in certain conditions,
the antibodies recognise self molecules as antigens and triggers unexpected
immune responses. This results in different autoimmune diseases depending on
the type of antigens and antibodies involved. Such conditions are always
harmful and sometimes deadly. The exact nature of antibody-antigen interaction
in autoimmune disease is not yet understood.[11][12].
***** Application[edit] *****
Antigen-antibody interaction is used in laboratory techniques for serological
test of blood compatibility and various pathogenic infections. The most basic
is ABO blood group determination, which is useful for blood transfusion.[13]
Sophisticated applications include ELISA,[14] enzyme-linked immunospot
(Elispot), immunofluorescence, and immunoelectrophoresis.[15][16][17]
**** Precipitation reaction[edit] ****
Soluble antigens combine with soluble antibodies in presence of an electrolyte
at suitable temperature and pH to form insoluble visible complex. This is
called a precipitation reaction. It is used for qualitative and quantitative
determination of both antigen and antibody. It involves the reaction of soluble
antigen with soluble antibodies to form large interlocking aggravated called
lattice . It occurs in tow distinct stage . firstly,the Antigen and antibody
rapidly form antigen-antibody complexs within few seconds and this is followed
by a slower reaction in which the antibody-antigen complexs forms Lattice that
precipitate from the solution.
A special ring test is useful for diagnosis of anthrax and determination of
adulteration in food.
**** Agglutination reaction[edit] ****
It acts on antigen-antibody reaction in which the antibodies cross-link
particulate antigens resulting in the visible clumping of the particle. There
are two types, namely active and passive agglutination. They are used in blood
tests for diagnosis of enteric fever.
