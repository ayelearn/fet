Mendelian inheritance is a type of biological inheritance that follows the laws
originally proposed by Gregor_Mendel in 1865 and 1866 and re-discovered in
1900. These laws were initially controversial. When Mendel's theories were
integrated with the BoveriâSutton_chromosome_theory of inheritance by Thomas
Hunt_Morgan in 1915, they became the core of classical_genetics. Ronald_Fisher
combined these ideas with the theory of natural_selection in his 1930 book The
Genetical_Theory_of_Natural_Selection, putting evolution onto a mathematical
footing and forming the basis for population_genetics within the modern
evolutionary_synthesis.[1]

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_genetics
The principles of Mendelian inheritance were named for and first derived by
Gregor_Johann_Mendel, a nineteenth-century Moravian monk who formulated his
ideas after conducting simple hybridisation experiments with pea plants (Pisum
sativum) he had planted in the garden of his monastery.[2] Between 1856 and
1863, Mendel cultivated and tested some 5,000 pea plants. From these
experiments, he induced two generalizations which later became known as
Mendel's Principles of Heredity or Mendelian inheritance. He described these
principles in a two-part paper, Versuche Ã¼ber Pflanzen-Hybriden (Experiments
on_Plant_Hybridization), that he read to the Natural History Society of Brno on
8 February and 8 March 1865, and which was published in 1866.[3]
Mendel's conclusions were largely ignored by the vast majority. Although they
were not completely unknown to biologists of the time, they were not seen as
generally applicable, even by Mendel himself, who thought they only applied to
certain categories of species or traits. A major block to understanding their
significance was the importance attached by 19th-century biologists to the
apparent_blending of many_inherited_traits in the overall appearance of the
progeny, now known to be due to multi-gene_interactions, in contrast to the
organ-specific binary characters studied by Mendel.[2] In 1900, however, his
work was "re-discovered" by three European scientists, Hugo_de_Vries, Carl
Correns, and Erich_von_Tschermak. The exact nature of the "re-discovery" has
been debated: De Vries published first on the subject, mentioning Mendel in a
footnote, while Correns pointed out Mendel's priority after having read De
Vries' paper and realizing that he himself did not have priority. De Vries may
not have acknowledged truthfully how much of his knowledge of the laws came
from his own work and how much came only after reading Mendel's paper. Later
scholars have accused Von Tschermak of not truly understanding the results at
all.[2]
Regardless, the "re-discovery" made Mendelism an important but controversial
theory. Its most vigorous promoter in Europe was William_Bateson, who coined
the terms "genetics" and "allele" to describe many of its tenets. The model of
heredity was contested by other biologists because it implied that heredity was
discontinuous, in opposition to the apparently continuous variation observable
for many traits. Many biologists also dismissed the theory because they were
not sure it would apply to all species. However, later work by biologists and
statisticians such as Ronald_Fisher showed that if multiple Mendelian factors
were involved in the expression of an individual trait, they could produce the
diverse results observed, and thus showed that Mendelian genetics is compatible
with natural_selection. Thomas_Hunt_Morgan and his assistants later integrated
Mendel's theoretical model with the chromosome theory of inheritance, in which
the chromosomes of cells were thought to hold the actual hereditary material,
and created what is now known as classical_genetics, a highly successful
foundation which eventually cemented Mendel's place in history.
Mendel's findings allowed scientists such as Fisher and J.B.S._Haldane to
predict the expression of traits on the basis of mathematical probabilities. An
important aspect of Mendel's success can be traced to his decision to start his
crosses only with plants he demonstrated were true-breeding. He only measured
discrete (binary) characteristics, such as color, shape, and position of the
seeds, rather than quantitatively variable characteristics. He expressed his
results numerically and subjected them to statistical analysis. His method of
data analysis and his large sample_size gave credibility to his data. He had
the foresight to follow several successive generations (F2, F3) of pea plants
and record their variations. Finally, he performed "test crosses" (backcrossing
descendants of the initial hybridization to the initial true-breeding lines) to
reveal the presence and proportions of recessive characters.
***** Mendel's laws[edit] *****
A Punnett_square for one of Mendel's pea plant experiments â self-
fertilization of the F1 generation
Mendel discovered that, when he crossed purebred white flower and purple flower
pea plants (the parental or P generation), the result was not a blend. Rather
than being a mix of the two, the offspring (known as the F1_generation) was
purple-flowered. When Mendel self-fertilized the F1 generation pea plants, he
obtained a purple flower to white flower ratio in the F2 generation of 3 to 1.
The results of this cross are tabulated in the Punnett_square to the right.
He then conceived the idea of heredity units, which he called "factors". Mendel
found that there are alternative forms of factorsânow called genesâthat
account for variations in inherited characteristics. For example, the gene for
flower color in pea plants exists in two forms, one for purple and the other
for white. The alternative "forms" are now called alleles. For each biological
trait, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. These alleles
may be the same or different. An organism that has two identical alleles for a
gene is said to be homozygous for that gene (and is called a homozygote). An
organism that has two different alleles for a gene is said be heterozygous for
that gene (and is called a heterozygote).
Mendel hypothesized that allele pairs separate randomly, or segregate, from
each other during the production of gametes: egg and sperm. Because allele
pairs separate during gamete production, a sperm or egg carries only one allele
for each inherited trait. When sperm and egg unite at fertilization, each
contributes its allele, restoring the paired condition in the offspring. This
is called the Law of Segregation. Mendel also found that each pair of alleles
segregates independently of the other pairs of alleles during gamete formation.
This is known as the Law of Independent Assortment.[4]
The genotype of an individual is made up of the many alleles it possesses. An
individual's physical appearance, or phenotype, is determined by its alleles as
well as by its environment. The presence of an allele does not mean that the
trait will be expressed in the individual that possesses it. If the two alleles
of an inherited pair differ (the heterozygous condition), then one determines
the organismâs appearance and is called the dominant_allele; the other has no
noticeable effect on the organismâs appearance and is called the recessive
allele. Thus, in the example above the dominant purple flower allele will hide
the phenotypic effects of the recessive white flower allele. This is known as
the Law of Dominance but it is not a transmission law: it concerns the
expression of the genotype. The upper case letters are used to represent
dominant alleles whereas the lowercase letters are used to represent recessive
alleles.

In the pea plant example above, the capital "B" represents the dominant allele
for purple flowers and lowercase "b" represents the recessive allele for white
flowers. Both parental plants were true-breeding, and one parental variety had
two alleles for purple flowers (BB) while the other had two alleles for white
flowers (bb). As a result of fertilization, the F1 hybrids each inherited one
allele for purple flowers and one for white. All the F1 hybrids (Bb) had purple
flowers, because the dominant B allele has its full effect in the heterozygote,
while the recessive b allele has no effect on flower color. For the F2 plants,
the ratio of plants with purple flowers to those with white flowers (3:1) is
called the phenotypic ratio. The genotypic ratio, as seen in the Punnett
square, is 1 BB : 2 Bb : 1 bb.
**** Law of Segregation of genes (the "First Law")[edit] ****
Figure 1 Dominant and recessive phenotypes.
(1) Parental generation.
(2) F1 generation.
(3) F2 generation. Dominant (red) and recessive (white) phenotype look alike in
the F1 (first) generation and show a 3:1 ratio in the F2 (second) generation.
The Law of Segregation states that every individual organism contains two
alleles for each trait, and that these alleles segregate (separate) during
meiosis such that each gamete contains only one of the alleles.[5] An offspring
thus receives a pair of alleles for a trait by inheriting homologous
chromosomes from the parent organisms: one allele for each trait from each
parent.[5]
Molecular proof of this principle was subsequently found through observation of
meiosis by two scientists independently, the German botanist Oscar_Hertwig in
1876, and the Belgian zoologist Edouard_Van_Beneden in 1883. Paternal and
maternal chromosomes get separated in meiosis and the alleles with the traits
of a character are segregated into two different gametes. Each parent
contributes a single gamete, and thus a single, randomly successful allele copy
to their offspring and fertilization.
**** Law of Independent Assortment (the "Second Law")[edit] ****
According to independent assortment, 3 homologous pairs create 8 possible
combinations, all equally likely to be fertilized. The equation to determine
the number of possible combinations given the number of homologous pairs = 2x
(x = number of homologous pairs)
Figure 2 Dihybrid cross. The phenotypes of two independent traits show a 9:3:3:
1 ratio in the F2 generation. In this example, coat color is indicated by B
(brown, dominant) or b (white), while tail length is indicated by S (short,
dominant) or s (long). When parents are homozygous for each trait (SSbb and
ssBB), their children in the F1 generation are heterozygous at both loci and
only show the dominant phenotypes (SsbB). If the children mate with each other,
in the F2 generation all combinations of coat color and tail length occur: 9
are brown/short (purple boxes), 3 are white/short (pink boxes), 3 are brown/
long (blue boxes) and 1 is white/long (green box).
The Law of Independent Assortment states that alleles for separate traits are
passed independently of one another.[6] That is, the biological selection of an
allele for one trait has nothing to do with the selection of an allele for any
other trait. Mendel found support for this law in his dihybrid cross
experiments (Fig. 1). In his monohybrid crosses, an idealized 3:1 ratio between
dominant and recessive phenotypes resulted. In dihybrid crosses, however, he
found a 9:3:3:1 ratios (Fig. 2). This shows that each of the two alleles is
inherited independently from the other, with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio for each.
Independent assortment occurs in eukaryotic organisms during meiotic metaphase
I, and produces a gamete with a mixture of the organism's chromosomes. The
physical basis of the independent assortment of chromosomes is the random
orientation of each bivalent chromosome along the metaphase plate with respect
to the other bivalent chromosomes. Along with crossing_over, independent
assortment increases genetic diversity by producing novel genetic combinations.
There are many violations of independent assortment due to genetic_linkage.
Of the 46 chromosomes in a normal diploid human cell, half are maternally
derived (from the mother's egg) and half are paternally derived (from the
father's sperm). This occurs as sexual_reproduction involves the fusion of two
haploid gametes (the egg and sperm) to produce a new organism having the full
complement of chromosomes. During gametogenesisâthe production of new gametes
by an adultâthe normal complement of 46 chromosomes needs to be halved to 23
to ensure that the resulting haploid gamete can join with another gamete to
produce a diploid organism. An error in the number of chromosomes, such as
those caused by a diploid gamete joining with a haploid gamete, is termed
aneuploidy.
In independent assortment, the chromosomes that result are randomly sorted from
all possible maternal and paternal chromosomes. Because zygotes end up with a
random mix instead of a pre-defined "set" from either parent, chromosomes are
therefore considered assorted independently. As such, the zygote can end up
with any combination of paternal or maternal chromosomes. Any of the possible
variants of a zygote formed from maternal and paternal chromosomes will occur
with equal frequency. For human gametes, with 23 pairs of chromosomes, the
number of possibilities is 223 or 8,388,608 possible combinations.[7] The
zygote will normally end up with 23 chromosomes pairs, but the origin of any
particular chromosome will be randomly selected from paternal or maternal
chromosomes. This contributes to the genetic variability of progeny.
**** Law of Dominance (the "Third Law")[edit] ****
Mendel's Law of Dominance states that recessive alleles will always be masked
by dominant alleles. Therefore, a cross between a homozygous dominant and a
homozygous recessive will always express the dominant phenotype, while still
having a heterozygous genotype. The Law of Dominance can be explained easily
with the help of a mono hybrid cross experiment:- In a cross between two
organisms pure for any pair (or pairs) of contrasting traits (characters), the
character that appears in the F1 generation is called "dominant" and the one
which is suppressed (not expressed) is called "recessive." Each character is
controlled by a pair of dissimilar factors. Only one of the characters
expresses. The one which expresses in the F1 generation is called Dominant.
However, the law of dominance is not universally applicable.[citation_needed]
***** Mendelian trait[edit] *****
A Mendelian trait is one that is controlled by a single locus in an inheritance
pattern. In such cases, a mutation in a single gene can cause a disease that is
inherited according to Mendel's laws. Examples include sickle-cell_anemia,
TayâSachs_disease, cystic_fibrosis and xeroderma_pigmentosa. A disease
controlled by a single gene contrasts with a multi-factorial disease, like
heart disease, which is affected by several loci (and the environment) as well
as those diseases inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion.[8]
***** Non-Mendelian inheritance[edit] *****
In four o'clock plants, the alleles for red and white flowers show incomplete
dominance. As seen in the F1 generation, heterozygous (wr) plants have "pink"
flowersâa mix of "red" (rr) and "white" (ww) coloring. The F2 generation
shows a 1:2:1 ratio of red:pink:white
Main article: Non-Mendelian_inheritance
Mendel explained inheritance in terms of discrete factorsâgenesâthat are
passed along from generation to generation according to the rules of
probability. Mendel's laws are valid for all sexually reproducing organisms,
including garden peas and human beings. However, Mendel's laws stop short of
explaining some patterns of genetic inheritance. For most sexually reproducing
organisms, cases where Mendel's laws can strictly account for the patterns of
inheritance are relatively rare. Often, the inheritance patterns are more
complex.
The F1 offspring of Mendel's pea crosses always looked like one of the two
parental varieties. In this situation of "complete dominance," the dominant
allele had the same phenotypic effect whether present in one or two copies. But
for some characteristics, the F1 hybrids have an appearance in between the
phenotypes of the two parental varieties. A cross between two four o'clock
(Mirabilis_jalapa) plants shows this common exception to Mendel's principles.
Some alleles are neither dominant nor recessive. The F1 generation produced by
a cross between red-flowered (RR) and white flowered (WW) Mirabilis jalapa
plants consists of pink-colored flowers. Neither allele is dominant in this
case. This third phenotype results from flowers of the heterzygote having less
red pigment than the red homozygotes. Cases in which one allele is not
completely dominant over another are called incomplete_dominance. In incomplete
dominance, the heterozygous phenotype lies somewhere between the two homozygous
phenotypes.
A similar situation arises from codominance, in which the phenotypes produced
by both alleles are clearly expressed. For example, in certain varieties of
chicken, the allele for black feathers is codominant with the allele for white
feathers. Heterozygous chickens have a color described as "erminette", speckled
with black and white feathers. Unlike the blending of red and white colors in
heterozygous four o'clocks, black and white colors appear separately in
chickens. Many human genes, including one for a protein that controls
cholesterol levels in the blood, show codominance, too. People with the
heterozygous form of this gene produce two different forms of the protein, each
with a different effect on cholesterol levels.
In Mendelian inheritance, genes have only two alleles, such as a and A. In
nature, such genes exist in several different forms and are therefore said to
have multiple_alleles. A gene with more than two alleles is said to have
multiple alleles. An individual, of course, usually has only two copies of each
gene, but many different alleles are often found within a population. One of
the best-known examples is coat color in rabbits. A rabbit's coat color is
determined by a single gene that has at least four different alleles. The four
known alleles display a pattern of simple dominance that can produce four coat
colors. Many other genes have multiple alleles, including the human genes for
ABO_blood_type.
Furthermore, many traits are produced by the interaction of several genes.
Traits controlled by two or more genes are said to be polygenic_traits.
Polygenic means "many genes." For example, at least three genes are involved in
making the reddish-brown pigment in the eyes of fruit flies. Polygenic traits
often show a wide range of phenotypes. The broad variety of skin color in
humans comes about partly because at least four different genes probably
control this trait.
