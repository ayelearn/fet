In Newtonian_mechanics, linear momentum, translational momentum, or simply
momentum (pl. momenta) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. It
is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction in three-
dimensional space. If m is an object's mass and v is the velocity (also a
vector), then the momentum is
          p  = m  v  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} ,}  [\mathbf
      {p} =m\mathbf {v} ,]
In SI_units, it is measured in kilogram_meters_per_second (kgâm/s). Newton's
second_law of motion states that a body's rate of change in momentum is equal
to the net force acting on it.
Momentum depends on the frame_of_reference, but in any inertial frame it is a
conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed_system is not affected by external
forces, its total linear momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved
in special_relativity (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form, in
electrodynamics, quantum_mechanics, quantum_field_theory, and general
relativity. It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space
and time: translational_symmetry.
Advanced formulations of classical mechanics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
mechanics, allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries
and constraints. In these systems the conserved quantity is generalized
momentum, and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined
above. The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum
mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a wave_function. The momentum and
position operators are related by the Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle.
In continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluids and deformable
bodies, a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the
conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the NavierâStokes
equations for fluids or the Cauchy_momentum_equation for deformable solids or
fluids.

***** Newtonian[edit] *****
Momentum is a vector_quantity: it has both magnitude and direction. Since
momentum has a direction, it can be used to predict the resulting direction and
speed of motion of objects after they collide. Below, the basic properties of
momentum are described in one dimension. The vector equations are almost
identical to the scalar equations (see multiple_dimensions).
**** Single particle[edit] ****
The momentum of a particle is conventionally represented by the letter p. It is
the product of two quantities, the particle's mass (represented by the letter
m) and its velocity (v):[1]
         p = m v .   {\displaystyle p=mv.}  [p=mv.]
The unit of momentum is the product of the units of mass and velocity. In SI
units, if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity is in meters per second
then the momentum is in kilogram meters per second (kgâm/s). In cgs_units, if
the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second, then the
momentum is in gram centimeters per second (gâcm/s).
Being a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1 kg model
airplane, traveling due north at 1 m/s in straight and level flight, has a
momentum of 1 kgâm/s due north measured with reference to the ground.
**** Many particles[edit] ****
The momentum of a system of particles is the vector sum of their momenta. If
two particles have respective masses m1 and m2, and velocities v1 and v2, the
total momentum is
             p    =  p  1   +  p  2         =  m  1    v  1   +  m  2    v  2
      .       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=p_{1}+p_{2}\\&=m_{1}v_{1}+m_
      {2}v_{2}\,.\end{aligned}}}  [{\begin{aligned}p&=p_{1}+p_{2}\\&=m_{1}v_
      {1}+m_{2}v_{2}\,.\end{aligned}}]
The momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the
following:
         p =  &#x2211;  i    m  i    v  i   .   {\displaystyle p=\sum _{i}m_
      {i}v_{i}.}  [{\displaystyle p=\sum _{i}m_{i}v_{i}.}]
A system of particles has a center_of_mass, a point determined by the weighted
sum of their positions:
          r  cm   =     m  1    r  1   +  m  2    r  2   + &#x22EF;    m  1   +
      m  2   + &#x22EF;    =     &#x2211;  i    m  i    r  i      &#x2211;  i
      m  i      .   {\displaystyle r_{\text{cm}}={\frac {m_{1}r_{1}+m_{2}r_
      {2}+\cdots }{m_{1}+m_{2}+\cdots }}={\frac {\sum \limits _{i}m_{i}r_{i}}
      {\sum \limits _{i}m_{i}}}.}  [{\displaystyle r_{\text{cm}}={\frac {m_
      {1}r_{1}+m_{2}r_{2}+\cdots }{m_{1}+m_{2}+\cdots }}={\frac {\sum \limits _
      {i}m_{i}r_{i}}{\sum \limits _{i}m_{i}}}.}]
If one or more of the particles is moving, the center of mass of the system
will generally be moving as well (unless the system is in pure rotation around
it). If the total mass of the particles is     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m], and
the center of mass is moving at velocity vcm, the momentum of the system is:
         p = m  v  cm   .   {\displaystyle p=mv_{\text{cm}}.}  [p=mv_{\text
      {cm}}.]
This is known as Euler's_first_law.[2][3]
**** Relation to force[edit] ****
If the net force F applied to a particle is constant, and is applied for a time
interval Ît, the momentum of the particle changes by an amount
         &#x0394; p = F &#x0394; t  .   {\displaystyle \Delta p=F\Delta t\,.}
      [\Delta p=F\Delta t\,.]
In differential form, this is Newton's_second_law; the rate of change of the
momentum of a particle is equal to the instantaneous force F acting on it,[1]
         F =    d p   d t    .   {\displaystyle F={\frac {dp}{dt}}.}  [F={\frac
      {dp}{dt}}.]
If the net force experienced by a particle changes as a function of time, F(t),
the change in momentum (or impulse J ) between times t1 and t2 is
         &#x0394; p = J =  &#x222B;   t  1      t  2     F ( t )  d t  .
      {\displaystyle \Delta p=J=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F(t)\,dt\,.}  [
      {\displaystyle \Delta p=J=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F(t)\,dt\,.}]
Impulse is measured in the derived_units of the newton_second (1 Nâs =
1 kgâm/s) or dyne second (1 dyneâs = 1 gâcm/s)
Under the assumption of constant mass m, it is equivalent to write
         F =    d ( m v )   d t    = m    d v   d t    = m a ,   {\displaystyle
      F={\frac {d(mv)}{dt}}=m{\frac {dv}{dt}}=ma,}  [{\displaystyle F={\frac {d
      (mv)}{dt}}=m{\frac {dv}{dt}}=ma,}]
hence the net force is equal to the mass of the particle times its
acceleration.[1]
Example: A model airplane of mass 1 kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of
6 m/s due north in 2 s. The net force required to produce this acceleration is
3 newtons due north. The change in momentum is 6 kgâm/s due north. The rate
of change of momentum is 3 (kgâm/s)/s due north which is numerically
equivalent to 3 newtons.
**** Conservation[edit] ****
In a closed_system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings
and is not acted on by external forces) the total momentum is constant. This
fact, known as the law of conservation of momentum, is implied by Newton's_laws
of_motion.[4][5] Suppose, for example, that two particles interact. Because of
the third law, the forces between them are equal and opposite. If the particles
are numbered 1 and 2, the second law states that F1 = dp1/dt and F2 = dp2/dt.
Therefore,
            d  p  1     d t    = &#x2212;    d  p  2     d t    ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {dp_{1}}{dt}}=-{\frac {dp_{2}}{dt}},}  [{\frac {dp_
      {1}}{dt}}=-{\frac {dp_{2}}{dt}},]
with the negative sign indicating that the forces oppose. Equivalently,
           d  d t     (   p  1   +  p  2    )  = 0.   {\displaystyle {\frac {d}
      {dt}}\left(p_{1}+p_{2}\right)=0.}  [{\frac {d}{dt}}\left(p_{1}+p_
      {2}\right)=0.]
If the velocities of the particles are u1 and u2 before the interaction, and
afterwards they are v1 and v2, then
          m  1    u  1   +  m  2    u  2   =  m  1    v  1   +  m  2    v  2
      .   {\displaystyle m_{1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}.}  [m_
      {1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}.]
This law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles.
Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each
pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero.
This conservation law applies to all interactions, including collisions and
separations caused by explosive forces.[4] It can also be generalized to
situations where Newton's laws do not hold, for example in the theory_of
relativity and in electrodynamics.[6]
**** Dependence on reference frame[edit] ****
Newton's apple in Einstein's elevator. In person A's frame of reference, the
apple has non-zero velocity and momentum. In the elevator's and person B's
frames of reference, it has zero velocity and momentum.
Momentum is a measurable quantity, and the measurement depends on the motion of
the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is
descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple
moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone
inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two
observers each have a frame_of_reference, in which, they observe motions, and,
if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is
consistent with those same physical laws.
Suppose a particle has position x in a stationary frame of reference. From the
point of view of another frame of reference, moving at a uniform speed u, the
position (represented by a primed coordinate) changes with time as
          x &#x2032;  = x &#x2212; u t  .   {\displaystyle x'=x-ut\,.}  [x'=x-
      ut\,.]
This is called a Galilean_transformation. If the particle is moving at speed
dx/dt = v in the first frame of reference, in the second, it is moving at speed
          v &#x2032;  =    d  x &#x2032;    d t    = v &#x2212; u  .
      {\displaystyle v'={\frac {dx'}{dt}}=v-u\,.}  [v'={\frac {dx'}{dt}}=v-
      u\,.]
Since u does not change, the accelerations are the same:
          a &#x2032;  =    d  v &#x2032;    d t    = a  .   {\displaystyle a'=
      {\frac {dv'}{dt}}=a\,.}  [a'={\frac {dv'}{dt}}=a\,.]
Thus, momentum is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, as long as the
force has the same form, in both frames, Newton's second law is unchanged.
Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance
between objects, satisfy this criterion. This independence of reference frame
is called Newtonian relativity or Galilean_invariance.[7]
A change of reference frame, can, often, simplify calculations of motion. For
example, in a collision of two particles, a reference frame can be chosen,
where, one particle begins at rest. Another, commonly used reference frame, is
the center_of_mass_frame â one that is moving with the center of mass. In
this frame, the total momentum is zero.
**** Application to collisions[edit] ****
By itself, the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the
motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, kinetic
energy, must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved,
the collision is called an elastic_collision; if not, it is an inelastic
collision.
*** Elastic collisions[edit] ***
Main article: Elastic_collision
Elastic collision of equal masses
Elastic collision of unequal masses
An elastic collision is one in which no kinetic_energy is absorbed in the
collision. Perfectly elastic "collisions" can occur when the objects do not
touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric
repulsion keeps them apart. A slingshot_maneuver of a satellite around a planet
can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision. A collision between two
pool balls is a good example of an almost totally elastic collision, due to
their high rigidity, but when bodies come in contact there is always some
dissipation.[8]
A head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities
in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities
are u1 and u2 before the collision and v1 and v2 after, the equations
expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:
              m  1    u  1   +  m  2    u  2      =  m  1    v  1   +  m  2
      v  2          1 2     m  1    u  1   2   +    1 2     m  2    u  2   2
      =    1 2     m  1    v  1   2   +    1 2     m  2    v  2   2    .
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}m_{1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}&=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_
      {2}\\{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{1}u_{1}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{2}u_{2}^{2}&={\tfrac
      {1}{2}}m_{1}v_{1}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{2}v_{2}^{2}\,.\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\begin{aligned}m_{1}u_{1}+m_{2}u_{2}&=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}\\{\tfrac {1}
      {2}}m_{1}u_{1}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{2}u_{2}^{2}&={\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{1}v_
      {1}^{2}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}m_{2}v_{2}^{2}\,.\end{aligned}}]
A change of reference frame can simplify analysis of a collision. For example,
suppose there are two bodies of equal mass m, one stationary and one
approaching the other at a speed v (as in the figure). The center of mass is
moving at speed v/2 and both bodies are moving towards it at speed v/2. Because
of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center
of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we
find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away
at speed v. The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the
velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the
same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by[4]
              v  1      =  u  2        v  2      =  u  1    .
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v_{1}&=u_{2}\\v_{2}&=u_{1}\,.\end
      {aligned}}}  [{\begin{aligned}v_{1}&=u_{2}\\v_{2}&=u_{1}\,.\end
      {aligned}}]
In general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are
given by[9]
          v  1   =  (     m  1   &#x2212;  m  2      m  1   +  m  2      )   u
      1   +  (    2  m  2      m  1   +  m  2      )   u  2      {\displaystyle
      v_{1}=\left({\frac {m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{1}+\left({\frac
      {2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{2}\,}  [v_{1}=\left({\frac {m_{1}-m_{2}}
      {m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{1}+\left({\frac {2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_
      {2}\,]
          v  2   =  (     m  2   &#x2212;  m  1      m  1   +  m  2      )   u
      2   +  (    2  m  1      m  1   +  m  2      )   u  1    .
      {\displaystyle v_{2}=\left({\frac {m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_
      {2}+\left({\frac {2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{1}\,.}  [v_{2}=\left(
      {\frac {m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{2}+\left({\frac {2m_{1}}{m_
      {1}+m_{2}}}\right)u_{1}\,.]
If one body has much greater mass than the other, its velocity will be little
affected by a collision while the other body will experience a large change.
*** Inelastic collisions[edit] ***
Main article: Inelastic_collision
a perfectly inelastic collision between equal masses
In an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies
is converted into other forms of energy (such as heat or sound). Examples
include traffic_collisions,[10] in which the effect of loss of kinetic energy
can be seen in the damage to the vehicles; electrons losing some of their
energy to atoms (as in the FranckâHertz_experiment);[11] and particle
accelerators in which the kinetic energy is converted into mass in the form of
new particles.
In a perfectly inelastic collision (such as a bug hitting a windshield), both
bodies have the same motion afterwards. If one body is motionless to begin
with, the equation for conservation of momentum is
          m  1    u  1   =  (   m  1   +  m  2    )  v  ,   {\displaystyle m_
      {1}u_{1}=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)v\,,}  [m_{1}u_{1}=\left(m_{1}+m_
      {2}\right)v\,,]
so
         v =    m  1     m  1   +  m  2       u  1    .   {\displaystyle v=
      {\frac {m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}u_{1}\,.}  [v={\frac {m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}u_
      {1}\,.]
In a frame of reference moving at the speed v), the objects are brought to rest
by the collision and 100% of the kinetic energy is converted to other forms of
energy.
One measure of the inelasticity of the collision is the coefficient_of
restitution CR, defined as the ratio of relative velocity of separation to
relative velocity of approach. In applying this measure to a ball bouncing from
a solid surface, this can be easily measured using the following formula:[12]
          C  R   =    bounce height drop height     .   {\displaystyle C_{\text
      {R}}={\sqrt {\frac {\text{bounce height}}{\text{drop height}}}}\,.}  [C_
      {\text{R}}={\sqrt {\frac {\text{bounce height}}{\text{drop height}}}}\,.]
The momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that
begin together and then move apart. For example, an explosion is the result of
a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical,
mechanical, or nuclear form into kinetic energy, acoustic energy, and
electromagnetic radiation. Rockets also make use of conservation of momentum:
propellant is thrust outward, gaining momentum, and an equal and opposite
momentum is imparted to the rocket.[13]
**** Multiple dimensions[edit] ****
Two-dimensional elastic collision. There is no motion perpendicular to the
image, so only two components are needed to represent the velocities and
momenta. The two blue vectors represent velocities after the collision and add
vectorially to get the initial (red) velocity.
Real motion has both direction and velocity and must be represented by a
vector. In a coordinate system with x, y, z axes, velocity has components vx in
the x-direction, vy in the y-direction, vz in the z-direction. The vector is
represented by a boldface symbol:[14]
          v  =  (   v  x   ,  v  y   ,  v  z    )  .   {\displaystyle \mathbf
      {v} =\left(v_{x},v_{y},v_{z}\right).}  [\mathbf {v} =\left(v_{x},v_{y},v_
      {z}\right).]
Similarly, the momentum is a vector quantity and is represented by a boldface
symbol:
          p  =  (   p  x   ,  p  y   ,  p  z    )  .   {\displaystyle \mathbf
      {p} =\left(p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\right).}  [\mathbf {p} =\left(p_{x},p_{y},p_
      {z}\right).]
The equations in the previous sections, work in vector form if the scalars p
and v are replaced by vectors p and v. Each vector equation represents three
scalar equations. For example,
          p  = m  v    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} }  [\mathbf {p}
      =m\mathbf {v} ]
represents three equations:[14]
              p  x      = m  v  x        p  y      = m  v  y        p  z      =
      m  v  z   .       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p_{x}&=mv_{x}\\p_
      {y}&=mv_{y}\\p_{z}&=mv_{z}.\end{aligned}}}  [{\begin{aligned}p_{x}&=mv_
      {x}\\p_{y}&=mv_{y}\\p_{z}&=mv_{z}.\end{aligned}}]
The kinetic energy equations are exceptions to the above replacement rule. The
equations are still one-dimensional, but each scalar represents the magnitude
of_the_vector, for example,
          v  2   =  v  x   2   +  v  y   2   +  v  z   2    .   {\displaystyle
      v^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}\,.}  [v^{2}=v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_
      {z}^{2}\,.]
Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. Often coordinates can
be chosen so that only two components are needed, as in the figure. Each
component can be obtained separately and the results combined to produce a
vector result.[14]
A simple construction involving the center of mass frame can be used to show
that if a stationary elastic sphere is struck by a moving sphere, the two will
head off at right angles after the collision (as in the figure).[15]
**** Objects of variable mass[edit] ****
See also: Variable-mass_system
The concept of momentum plays a fundamental role in explaining the behavior of
variable-mass objects such as a rocket ejecting fuel or a star accreting gas.
In analyzing such an object, one treats the object's mass as a function that
varies with time: m(t). The momentum of the object at time t is therefore p(t)
= m(t)v(t). One might then try to invoke Newton's second law of motion by
saying that the external force F on the object is related to its momentum p(t)
by F = dp/dt, but this is incorrect, as is the related expression found by
applying the product rule to d(mv)/dt:[16]
         F = m ( t )    d v   d t    + v ( t )    d m   d t    .
      {\displaystyle F=m(t){\frac {dv}{dt}}+v(t){\frac {dm}{dt}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle F=m(t){\frac {dv}{dt}}+v(t){\frac {dm}{dt}}.}] (incorrect)
      [why?]
This equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable-mass objects.
The correct equation is
         F = m ( t )    d v   d t    &#x2212; u    d m   d t    ,
      {\displaystyle F=m(t){\frac {dv}{dt}}-u{\frac {dm}{dt}},}  [F=m(t){\frac
      {dv}{dt}}-u{\frac {dm}{dt}},]
where u is the velocity of the ejected/accreted mass as seen in the object's
rest frame.[16] This is distinct from v, which is the velocity of the object
itself as seen in an inertial frame.
This equation is derived by keeping track of both the momentum of the object as
well as the momentum of the ejected/accreted mass (dm). When considered
together, the object and the mass (dm) constitute a closed system in which
total momentum is conserved.
         P ( t + d t ) = ( m &#x2212; d m ) ( v + d v ) + d m ( v &#x2212; u )
      = m v + m d v &#x2212; u d m = P ( t ) + m d v &#x2212; u d m
      {\displaystyle P(t+dt)=(m-dm)(v+dv)+dm(v-u)=mv+mdv-udm=P(t)+mdv-udm}  [
      {\displaystyle P(t+dt)=(m-dm)(v+dv)+dm(v-u)=mv+mdv-udm=P(t)+mdv-udm}]
***** Relativistic[edit] *****

momentum
**** Lorentz invariance[edit] ****
Newtonian physics assumes that absolute_time_and_space exist outside of any
observer; this gives rise to Galilean_invariance. It also results in a
prediction that the speed_of_light can vary from one reference frame to
another. This is contrary to observation. In the special_theory_of_relativity,
Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the
reference frame, but assumes that the speed of light c is invariant. As a
result, position and time in two reference frames are related by the Lorentz
transformation instead of the Galilean_transformation.[17]
Consider, for example, a reference frame moving relative to another at velocity
v in the x direction. The Galilean transformation gives the coordinates of the
moving frame as
              t &#x2032;     = t      x &#x2032;     = x &#x2212; v t
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t'&=t\\x'&=x-vt\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t'&=t\\x'&=x-vt\end{aligned}}}]
while the Lorentz transformation gives[18]
              t &#x2032;     = &#x03B3;  (  t &#x2212;    v x   c  2      )
      x &#x2032;     = &#x03B3;  (  x &#x2212; v t  )         {\displaystyle
      {\begin{aligned}t'&=\gamma \left(t-{\frac {vx}{c^{2}}}\right)\\x'&=\gamma
      \left(x-vt\right)\,\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}t'&=\gamma \left(t-{\frac {vx}{c^{2}}}\right)\\x'&=\gamma \left
      (x-vt\right)\,\end{aligned}}}]
where Î³ is the Lorentz_factor:
         &#x03B3; =   1  1 &#x2212;  v  2    /   c  2      .   {\displaystyle
      \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}.}  [{\displaystyle \gamma =
      {\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}.}]
Newton's second law, with mass fixed, is not invariant under a Lorentz
transformation. However, it can be made invariant by making the inertial mass m
of an object a function of velocity:
         m = &#x03B3;  m  0    ;   {\displaystyle m=\gamma m_{0}\,;}  [m=\gamma
      m_{0}\,;]
m0 is the object's invariant_mass.[19]
The modified momentum,
          p  = &#x03B3;  m  0    v   ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =\gamma m_
      {0}\mathbf {v} \,,}  [\mathbf {p} =\gamma m_{0}\mathbf {v} \,,]
obeys Newton's second law:
          F  =    d  p    d t     .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac
      {d\mathbf {p} }{dt}}\,.}  [\mathbf {F} ={\frac {d\mathbf {p} }{dt}}\,.]
Within the domain of classical mechanics, relativistic momentum closely
approximates Newtonian momentum: at low velocity, Î³m0v is approximately equal
to m0v, the Newtonian expression for momentum.
**** Four-vector formulation[edit] ****
Main article: Four-momentum
In the theory of special relativity, physical quantities are expressed in terms
of four-vectors that include time as a fourth coordinate along with the three
space coordinates. These vectors are generally represented by capital letters,
for example R for position. The expression for the four-momentum depends on how
the coordinates are expressed. Time may be given in its normal units or
multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four-vector
have dimensions of length. If the latter scaling is used, an interval of proper
time, Ï, defined by[20]
          c  2   d  &#x03C4;  2   =  c  2   d  t  2   &#x2212; d  x  2
      &#x2212; d  y  2   &#x2212; d  z  2    ,   {\displaystyle c^{2}d\tau ^
      {2}=c^{2}dt^{2}-dx^{2}-dy^{2}-dz^{2}\,,}  [c^{2}d\tau ^{2}=c^{2}dt^{2}-
      dx^{2}-dy^{2}-dz^{2}\,,]
is invariant under Lorentz transformations (in this expression and in what
follows the (+ â â â) metric_signature has been used, different authors
use different conventions). Mathematically this invariance can be ensured in
one of two ways: by treating the four-vectors as Euclidean_vectors and
multiplying time by √â1; or by keeping time a real quantity and embedding the
vectors in a Minkowski_space.[21] In a Minkowski space, the scalar_product of
two four-vectors U = (U0,U1,U2,U3) and V = (V0,V1,V2,V3) is defined as
          U  &#x22C5;  V  =  U  0    V  0   &#x2212;  U  1    V  1   &#x2212;
      U  2    V  2   &#x2212;  U  3    V  3    .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {U}
      \cdot \mathbf {V} =U_{0}V_{0}-U_{1}V_{1}-U_{2}V_{2}-U_{3}V_{3}\,.}
      [\mathbf {U} \cdot \mathbf {V} =U_{0}V_{0}-U_{1}V_{1}-U_{2}V_{2}-U_{3}V_
      {3}\,.]
In all the coordinate systems, the (contravariant) relativistic four-velocity
is defined by
          U  &#x2261;    d  R    d &#x03C4;    = &#x03B3;    d  R    d t     ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {U} \equiv {\frac {d\mathbf {R} }{d\tau }}=\gamma
      {\frac {d\mathbf {R} }{dt}}\,,}  [\mathbf {U} \equiv {\frac {d\mathbf {R}
      }{d\tau }}=\gamma {\frac {d\mathbf {R} }{dt}}\,,]
and the (contravariant) four-momentum is
          P  =  m  0    U   ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =m_{0}\mathbf {U}
      \,,}  [\mathbf {P} =m_{0}\mathbf {U} \,,]
where m0 is the invariant mass. If R = (ct,x,y,z) (in Minkowski space), then
          P  = &#x03B3;  m  0    (  c ,  v   )  = ( m c ,  p  )  .
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\gamma m_{0}\left(c,\mathbf {v} \right)=
      (mc,\mathbf {p} )\,.}  [\mathbf {P} =\gamma m_{0}\left(c,\mathbf {v}
      \right)=(mc,\mathbf {p} )\,.]
Using Einstein's mass-energy_equivalence, E = mc2, this can be rewritten as
          P  =  (    E c   ,  p   )   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\left(
      {\frac {E}{c}},\mathbf {p} \right)\,.}  [\mathbf {P} =\left({\frac {E}
      {c}},\mathbf {p} \right)\,.]
Thus, conservation of four-momentum is Lorentz-invariant and implies
conservation of both mass and energy.
The magnitude of the momentum four-vector is equal to m0c:
          |   |   P   |    |   2   =  P  &#x22C5;  P  =  &#x03B3;  2    m  0
      2   (  c  2   &#x2212;  v  2   ) = (  m  0   c  )  2    ,
      {\displaystyle ||\mathbf {P} ||^{2}=\mathbf {P} \cdot \mathbf {P} =\gamma
      ^{2}m_{0}^{2}(c^{2}-v^{2})=(m_{0}c)^{2}\,,}  [||\mathbf {P} ||^
      {2}=\mathbf {P} \cdot \mathbf {P} =\gamma ^{2}m_{0}^{2}(c^{2}-v^{2})=(m_
      {0}c)^{2}\,,]
and is invariant across all reference frames.
The relativistic energyâmomentum relationship holds even for massless
particles such as photons; by setting m0 = 0 it follows that
         E = p c  .   {\displaystyle E=pc\,.}  [E=pc\,.]
In a game of relativistic "billiards", if a stationary particle is hit by a
moving particle in an elastic collision, the paths formed by the two afterwards
will form an acute angle. This is unlike the non-relativistic case where they
travel at right angles.[22]
The four-momentum of a planar wave can be related to a wave four-vector[23]
          P  =  (    E c   ,     p  &#x2192;     )  = &#x210F;  K  = &#x210F;
      (    &#x03C9; c   ,     k  &#x2192;     )    {\displaystyle \mathbf {P}
      =\left({\frac {E}{c}},{\vec {\mathbf {p} }}\right)=\hbar \mathbf {K}
      =\hbar \left({\frac {\omega }{c}},{\vec {\mathbf {k} }}\right)}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\left({\frac {E}{c}},{\vec {\mathbf {p}
      }}\right)=\hbar \mathbf {K} =\hbar \left({\frac {\omega }{c}},{\vec
      {\mathbf {k} }}\right)}]
For a particle, the relationship between temporal components, E = Ä§ Ï, is the
PlanckâEinstein_relation, and the relation between spatial components, p= Ä§
k, describes a de_Broglie matter_wave.
***** Generalized[edit] *****
See also: Analytical_mechanics
Newton's laws can be difficult to apply to many kinds of motion because the
motion is limited by constraints. For example, a bead on an abacus is
constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing
at a fixed distance from the pivot. Many such constraints can be incorporated
by changing the normal Cartesian_coordinates to a set of generalized
coordinates that may be fewer in number.[24] Refined mathematical methods have
been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates. They
introduce a generalized momentum, also known as the canonical or conjugate
momentum, that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and angular
momentum. To distinguish it from generalized momentum, the product of mass and
velocity is also referred to as mechanical, kinetic or kinematic momentum.[6]
[25][26] The two main methods are described below.
**** Lagrangian mechanics[edit] ****
In Lagrangian_mechanics, a Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the
kinetic energy T and the potential_energy V:
           L   = T &#x2212; V  .   {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=T-V\,.}  [
      {\mathcal {L}}=T-V\,.]
If the generalized coordinates are represented as a vector q = (q1, q2, ... ,
qN)  and time differentiation is represented by a dot over the variable, then
the equations of motion (known as the Lagrange or EulerâLagrange_equations)
are a set of N equations:[27]
           d  d t     (    &#x2202;   L     &#x2202;     q &#x02D9;     j
      )  &#x2212;    &#x2202;   L     &#x2202;  q  j      = 0  .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\left({\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}
      {\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}
      {\partial q_{j}}}=0\,.}  [{\frac {d}{dt}}\left({\frac {\partial {\mathcal
      {L}}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\right)-{\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}
      {\partial q_{j}}}=0\,.]
If a coordinate qi is not a Cartesian coordinate, the associated generalized
momentum component pi does not necessarily have the dimensions of linear
momentum. Even if qi is a Cartesian coordinate, pi will not be the same as the
mechanical momentum if the potential depends on velocity.[6] Some sources
represent the kinematic momentum by the symbol Î .[28]
In this mathematical framework, a generalized momentum is associated with the
generalized coordinates. Its components are defined as
          p  j   =    &#x2202;   L     &#x2202;     q &#x02D9;     j       .
      {\displaystyle p_{j}={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial {\dot
      {q}}_{j}}}\,.}  [p_{j}={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial {\dot
      {q}}_{j}}}\,.]
Each component pj is said to be the conjugate momentum for the coordinate qj.
Now if a given coordinate qi does not appear in the Lagrangian (although its
time derivative might appear), then
          p  j   =  constant   .   {\displaystyle p_{j}={\text{constant}}\,.}
      [p_{j}={\text{constant}}\,.]
This is the generalization of the conservation of momentum.[6]
Even if the generalized coordinates are just the ordinary spatial coordinates,
the conjugate momenta are not necessarily the ordinary momentum coordinates. An
example is found in the section on electromagnetism.
**** Hamiltonian mechanics[edit] ****
In Hamiltonian_mechanics, the Lagrangian (a function of generalized coordinates
and their derivatives) is replaced by a Hamiltonian that is a function of
generalized coordinates and momentum. The Hamiltonian is defined as
           H    (   q  ,  p  , t  )  =  p  &#x22C5;     q  &#x02D9;    &#x2212;
      L    (   q  ,     q  &#x02D9;    , t  )   ,   {\displaystyle {\mathcal
      {H}}\left(\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {p} ,t\right)=\mathbf {p} \cdot {\dot
      {\mathbf {q} }}-{\mathcal {L}}\left(\mathbf {q} ,{\dot {\mathbf {q}
      }},t\right)\,,}  [{\mathcal {H}}\left(\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {p}
      ,t\right)=\mathbf {p} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {q} }}-{\mathcal {L}}\left
      (\mathbf {q} ,{\dot {\mathbf {q} }},t\right)\,,]
where the momentum is obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian as above. The
Hamiltonian equations of motion are[29]
                 q &#x02D9;     i      =    &#x2202;   H     &#x2202;  p  i
      &#x2212;     p &#x02D9;     i      =    &#x2202;   H     &#x2202;  q  i
      &#x2212;    &#x2202;   L     &#x2202; t       =    d   H     d t     .
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\dot {q}}_{i}&={\frac {\partial {\mathcal
      {H}}}{\partial p_{i}}}\\-{\dot {p}}_{i}&={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}
      {\partial q_{i}}}\\-{\frac {\partial {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial t}}&={\frac
      {d{\mathcal {H}}}{dt}}\,.\end{aligned}}}  [{\begin{aligned}{\dot {q}}_
      {i}&={\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}{\partial p_{i}}}\\-{\dot {p}}_{i}&=
      {\frac {\partial {\mathcal {H}}}{\partial q_{i}}}\\-{\frac {\partial
      {\mathcal {L}}}{\partial t}}&={\frac {d{\mathcal {H}}}{dt}}\,.\end
      {aligned}}]
As in Lagrangian mechanics, if a generalized coordinate does not appear in the
Hamiltonian, its conjugate momentum component is conserved.[30]
**** Symmetry and conservation[edit] ****
Conservation of momentum is a mathematical consequence of the homogeneity
(shift symmetry) of space (position in space is the canonical_conjugate
quantity to momentum). That is, conservation of momentum is a consequence of
the fact that the laws of physics do not depend on position; this is a special
case of Noether's_theorem.[31]
***** Electromagnetic[edit] *****
**** Particle in a field[edit] ****
In Maxwell's equations, the forces between particles are mediated by electric
and magnetic fields. The electromagnetic force (Lorentz_force) on a particle
with charge q due to a combination of electric_field E and magnetic_field B is
          F  = q (  E  +  v  &#x00D7;  B  ) .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q
      (\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} ).}  [\mathbf {F} =q(\mathbf
      {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} ).]
(in SI_units).[32]:2 It has an electric_potential Ï(r, t) and magnetic_vector
potential A(r, t).[28] In the non-relativistic regime, its generalized momentum
is
          P  = m   v   + q  A  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =m\mathbf
      {\mathbf {v} } +q\mathbf {A} ,}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =m\mathbf
      {\mathbf {v} } +q\mathbf {A} ,}]
while in relativistic mechanics this becomes
          P  = &#x03B3; m   v   + q  A  .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} =\gamma
      m\mathbf {\mathbf {v} } +q\mathbf {A} .}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {P}
      =\gamma m\mathbf {\mathbf {v} } +q\mathbf {A} .}]
**** Conservation[edit] ****
In Newtonian mechanics, the law of conservation of momentum can be derived from
the law_of_action_and_reaction, which states that every force has a
reciprocating equal and opposite force. Under some circumstances, moving
charged particles can exert forces on each other in non-opposite directions.
[33] Nevertheless, the combined momentum of the particles and the
electromagnetic field is conserved.
*** Vacuum[edit] ***
The Lorentz force imparts a momentum to the particle, so by Newton's second law
the particle must impart a momentum to the electromagnetic fields.[34]
In a vacuum, the momentum per unit volume is
          g  =   1   &#x03BC;  0    c  2       E  &#x00D7;  B   ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}\mathbf {E} \times
      \mathbf {B} \,,}  [\mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}\mathbf {E}
      \times \mathbf {B} \,,]
where Î¼0 is the vacuum_permeability and c is the speed_of_light. The momentum
density is proportional to the Poynting_vector S which gives the directional
rate of energy transfer per unit area:[34][35]
          g  =    S   c  2      .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {\mathbf
      {S} }{c^{2}}}\,.}  [\mathbf {g} ={\frac {\mathbf {S} }{c^{2}}}\,.]
If momentum is to be conserved over the volume V over a region Q, changes in
the momentum of matter through the Lorentz force must be balanced by changes in
the momentum of the electromagnetic field and outflow of momentum. If Pmech is
the momentum of all the particles in Q, and the particles are treated as a
continuum, then Newton's second law gives
            d   P   mech     d t    =  &#x222D;  Q    (  &#x03C1;  E  +  J
      &#x00D7;  B   )  d V  .   {\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {P} _{\text
      {mech}}}{dt}}=\iiint \limits _{Q}\left(\rho \mathbf {E} +\mathbf {J}
      \times \mathbf {B} \right)dV\,.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {P} _
      {\text{mech}}}{dt}}=\iiint \limits _{Q}\left(\rho \mathbf {E} +\mathbf
      {J} \times \mathbf {B} \right)dV\,.}]
The electromagnetic momentum is
           P   field   =   1   &#x03BC;  0    c  2       &#x222D;  Q    E
      &#x00D7;  B   d V  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{\text{field}}={\frac
      {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}\iiint \limits _{Q}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {B}
      \,dV\,,}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{\text{field}}={\frac {1}{\mu _
      {0}c^{2}}}\iiint \limits _{Q}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {B} \,dV\,,}]
and the equation for conservation of each component i of the momentum is
           d  d t      (    P   mech   +   P   field    )   i   =  &#x222C;
      &#x03C3;    (   &#x2211;  j    T  i j    n  j    )  d &#x03A3;  .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\left(\mathbf {P} _{\text{mech}}+\mathbf
      {P} _{\text{field}}\right)_{i}=\iint \limits _{\sigma }\left(\sum \limits

*** Media[edit] ***
The above results are for the microscopic Maxwell equations, applicable to
electromagnetic forces in a vacuum (or on a very small scale in media). It is
more difficult to define momentum density in media because the division into
electromagnetic and mechanical is arbitrary. The definition of electromagnetic
momentum density is modified to
          g  =   1  c  2      E  &#x00D7;  H  =    S   c  2      ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{c^{2}}}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf
      {H} ={\frac {\mathbf {S} }{c^{2}}}\,,}  [\mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{c^
      {2}}}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {H} ={\frac {\mathbf {S} }{c^{2}}}\,,]
where the H-field H is related to the B-field and the magnetization M by
          B  =  &#x03BC;  0    (   H  +  M   )   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {B}
      =\mu _{0}\left(\mathbf {H} +\mathbf {M} \right)\,.}  [\mathbf {B} =\mu _
      {0}\left(\mathbf {H} +\mathbf {M} \right)\,.]
The electromagnetic stress tensor depends on the properties of the media.[34]
***** Quantum mechanical[edit] *****
Further information: Momentum_operator
In quantum_mechanics, momentum is defined as a self-adjoint_operator on the
wave_function. The Heisenberg uncertainty_principle defines limits on how
accurately the momentum and position of a single observable system can be known
at once. In quantum mechanics, position and momentum are conjugate_variables.
For a single particle described in the position basis the momentum operator can
be written as
          p  =   &#x210F; i   &#x2207; = &#x2212; i &#x210F; &#x2207;  ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ={\hbar \over i}\nabla =-i\hbar \nabla \,,}
      [\mathbf {p} ={\hbar  \over i}\nabla =-i\hbar \nabla \,,]
where â is the gradient operator, Ä§ is the reduced_Planck_constant, and i is
the imaginary_unit. This is a commonly encountered form of the momentum
operator, though the momentum operator in other bases can take other forms. For
example, in momentum_space the momentum operator is represented as
          p  &#x03C8; ( p ) = p &#x03C8; ( p )  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {p}
      \psi (p)=p\psi (p)\,,}  [\mathbf {p} \psi (p)=p\psi (p)\,,]
where the operator p acting on a wave function Ï(p) yields that wave function
multiplied by the value p, in an analogous fashion to the way that the position
operator acting on a wave function Ï(x) yields that wave function multiplied
by the value x.
For both massive and massless objects, relativistic momentum is related to the
phase_constant     &#x03B2;   {\displaystyle \beta }  [\beta ] by[36]
         p = &#x210F; &#x03B2;   {\displaystyle p=\hbar \beta }  [
      {\displaystyle p=\hbar \beta }]
Electromagnetic_radiation (including visible_light, ultraviolet light, and
radio_waves) is carried by photons. Even though photons (the particle aspect of
light) have no mass, they still carry momentum. This leads to applications such
as the solar_sail. The calculation of the momentum of light within dielectric
media is somewhat controversial (see AbrahamâMinkowski_controversy).[37][38]
***** In deformable bodies and fluids[edit] *****
**** Conservation in a continuum[edit] ****
Main article: Cauchy_momentum_equation
Motion of a material body
In fields such as fluid_dynamics and solid_mechanics, it is not feasible to
follow the motion of individual atoms or molecules. Instead, the materials must
be approximated by a continuum in which there is a particle or fluid_parcel at
each point that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small
region nearby. In particular, it has a density Ï and velocity v that depend on
time t and position r. The momentum per unit volume is Ïv.[39]
Consider a column of water in hydrostatic_equilibrium. All the forces on the
water are in balance and the water is motionless. On any given drop of water,
two forces are balanced. The first is gravity, which acts directly on each atom
and molecule inside. The gravitational force per unit volume is Ïg, where g is
the gravitational_acceleration. The second force is the sum of all the forces
exerted on its surface by the surrounding water. The force from below is
greater than the force from above by just the amount needed to balance gravity.
The normal force per unit area is the pressure p. The average force per unit
volume inside the droplet is the gradient of the pressure, so the force balance
equation is[40]
         &#x2212; &#x2207; p + &#x03C1;  g  = 0  .   {\displaystyle -\nabla
      p+\rho \mathbf {g} =0\,.}  [-\nabla p+\rho \mathbf {g} =0\,.]
If the forces are not balanced, the droplet accelerates. This acceleration is
not simply the partial derivative âv/ât because the fluid in a given volume
changes with time. Instead, the material_derivative is needed:[41]
           D  D t    &#x2261;   &#x2202;  &#x2202; t    +  v  &#x22C5;
      &#x2207;   .   {\displaystyle {\frac {D}{Dt}}\equiv {\frac {\partial }
      {\partial t}}+\mathbf {v} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\,.}  [{\frac {D}
      {Dt}}\equiv {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {v} \cdot
      {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\,.]
Applied to any physical quantity, the material derivative includes the rate of
change at a point and the changes due to advection as fluid is carried past the
point. Per unit volume, the rate of change in momentum is equal to ÏDv/Dt.
This is equal to the net force on the droplet.
Forces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the
pressure and gravity, as above. In addition, surface forces can deform the
droplet. In the simplest case, a shear_stress Ï, exerted by a force parallel
to the surface of the droplet, is proportional to the rate of deformation or
strain_rate. Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient
because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another. If the speed in
the x direction varies with z, the tangential force in direction x per unit
area normal to the z direction is
          &#x03C3;  zx   = &#x2212; &#x03BC;    &#x2202;  v  x     &#x2202; z
      ,   {\displaystyle \sigma _{\text{zx}}=-\mu {\frac {\partial v_{x}}
      {\partial z}}\,,}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{\text{zx}}=-\mu {\frac
      {\partial v_{x}}{\partial z}}\,,}]
where Î¼ is the viscosity. This is also a flux, or flow per unit area, of x-
momentum through the surface.[42]
Including the effect of viscosity, the momentum balance equations for the
incompressible_flow of a Newtonian_fluid are
         &#x03C1;    D  v    D t    = &#x2212;  &#x2207;  p + &#x03BC;
      &#x2207;  2    v  + &#x03C1;  g  .    {\displaystyle \rho {\frac
      {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}=-{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}p+\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v}
      +\rho \mathbf {g} .\,}  [\rho {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}=-{\boldsymbol
      {\nabla }}p+\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v} +\rho \mathbf {g} .\,]
These are known as the NavierâStokes_equations.[43]
The momentum balance equations can be extended to more general materials,
including solids. For each surface with normal in direction i and force in
direction j, there is a stress component Ïij. The nine components make up the
Cauchy_stress_tensor Ï, which includes both pressure and shear. The local
conservation of momentum is expressed by the Cauchy_momentum_equation:
         &#x03C1;    D  v    D t    =  &#x2207;  &#x22C5;  &#x03C3;  +  f   ,
      {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}={\boldsymbol {\nabla
      }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}+\mathbf {f} \,,}  [\rho {\frac {D\mathbf
      {v} }{Dt}}={\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}+\mathbf
      {f} \,,]
where f is the body_force.[44]
The Cauchy momentum equation is broadly applicable to deformations of solids
and liquids. The relationship between the stresses and the strain rate depends
on the properties of the material (see Types_of_viscosity).
**** Acoustic waves[edit] ****
A disturbance in a medium gives rise to oscillations, or waves, that propagate
away from their source. In a fluid, small changes in pressure p can often be
described by the acoustic_wave_equation:
             &#x2202;  2   p   &#x2202;  t  2      =  c  2    &#x2207;  2   p
      ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}p}{\partial t^{2}}}=c^{2}\nabla ^
      {2}p\,,}  [{\frac {\partial ^{2}p}{\partial t^{2}}}=c^{2}\nabla ^{2}p\,,]
where c is the speed_of_sound. In a solid, similar equations can be obtained
for propagation of pressure (P-waves) and shear (S-waves).[45]
The flux, or transport per unit area, of a momentum component Ïvj by a
velocity vi is equal to Ï vjvj. In the linear approximation that leads to the
above acoustic equation, the time average of this flux is zero. However,
nonlinear effects can give rise to a nonzero average.[46] It is possible for
momentum flux to occur even though the wave itself does not have a mean
momentum.[47]
***** History of the concept[edit] *****
See also: Theory_of_impetus
In about 530 AD, working in Alexandria, Byzantine philosopher John_Philoponus
developed a concept of momentum in his commentary to Aristotle's Physics.
Aristotle claimed that everything that is moving must be kept moving by
something. For example, a thrown ball must be kept moving by motions of the
air. Most writers continued to accept Aristotle's theory until the time of
Galileo, but a few were skeptical. Philoponus pointed out the absurdity in
Aristotle's claim that motion of an object is promoted by the same air that is
resisting its passage. He proposed instead that an impetus was imparted to the
object in the act of throwing it.[48] Ibn SÄ«nÄ (also known by his Latinized
name Avicenna) read Philoponus and published his own theory of motion in The
Book of Healing in 1020. He agreed that an impetus is imparted to a projectile
by the thrower; but unlike Philoponus, who believed that it was a temporary
virtue that would decline even in a vacuum, he viewed it as a persistent,
requiring external forces such as air_resistance to dissipate it.[49][50][51]
The work of Philoponus, and possibly that of Ibn SÄ«nÄ,[51] was read and
refined by the European philosophers Peter_Olivi and Jean_Buridan. Buridan, who
in about 1350 was made rector of the University of Paris, referred to impetus
being proportional to the weight times the speed. Moreover, Buridan's theory
was different from his predecessor's in that he did not consider impetus to be
self-dissipating, asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air
resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus.[52][53]
RenÃ©_Descartes believed that the total "quantity of motion" (Latin: quantitas
motus) in the universe is conserved,[54] where the quantity of motion is
understood as the product of size and speed. This should not be read as a
statement of the modern law of momentum, since he had no concept of mass as
distinct from weight and size, and more importantly he believed that it is
speed rather than velocity that is conserved. So for Descartes if a moving
object were to bounce off a surface, changing its direction but not its speed,
there would be no change in its quantity of motion.[55][56] Galileo, in his Two
New_Sciences, used the Italian word impeto to similarly describe Descartes'
quantity of motion.
Leibniz, in his "Discourse_on_Metaphysics", gave an argument against Descartes'
construction of the conservation of the "quantity of motion" using an example
of dropping blocks of different sizes different distances. He points out that
force is conserved but quantity of motion, construed as the product of size and
speed of an object, is not conserved.[57]
The first correct statement of the law of conservation of momentum was by
English mathematician John_Wallis in his 1670 work, Mechanica sive De Motu,
Tractatus Geometricus: "the initial state of the body, either of rest or of
motion, will persist" and "If the force is greater than the resistance, motion
will result".[58] Wallis uses momentum and vis for force. Newton's PhilosophiÃ¦
Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica, when it was first published in 1687, showed a
similar casting around for words to use for the mathematical momentum. His
Definition II defines quantitas motus, "quantity of motion", as "arising from
the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly", which identifies it as
momentum.[59] Thus when in Law II he refers to mutatio motus, "change of
motion", being proportional to the force impressed, he is generally taken to
mean momentum and not motion.[60] It remained only to assign a standard term to
the quantity of motion. The first use of "momentum" in its proper mathematical
sense is not clear but by the time of Jenning's Miscellanea in 1721, five years
before the final edition of Newton's Principia Mathematica, momentum M or
"quantity of motion" was being defined for students as "a rectangle", the
product of Q and V, where Q is "quantity of material" and V is "velocity", s/t.
