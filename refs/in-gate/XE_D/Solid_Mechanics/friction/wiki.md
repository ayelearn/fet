Simulated blocks with fractal rough surfaces, exhibiting static frictional
interactions[1]
Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid
layers, and material elements sliding against each other.[2] There are several
types of friction:
    * Dry friction is a force that opposes the relative lateral motion of two
      solid surfaces in contact. Dry friction is subdivided into static
      friction ("stiction") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction
      between moving surfaces. With the exception of atomic or molecular
      friction, dry friction generally arises from the interaction of surface
      features, known as asperities
    * Fluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid
      that are moving relative to each other.[3][4]
    * Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a lubricant fluid
      separates two solid surfaces.[5][6][7]
    * Skin friction is a component of drag, the force resisting the motion of a
      fluid across the surface of a body.
    * Internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements
      making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation.[4]
When surfaces in contact move relative to each other, the friction between the
two surfaces converts kinetic_energy into thermal_energy (that is, it converts
work to heat). This property can have dramatic consequences, as illustrated by
the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire.
Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction
occurs, for example when a viscous fluid is stirred. Another important
consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to
performance degradation or damage to components. Friction is a component of the
science of tribology.
Friction is desirable and important in supplying traction to facilitate motion
on land. Most land_vehicles rely on friction for acceleration, deceleration and
changing direction. Sudden reductions in traction can cause loss of control and
accidents.
Friction is not itself a fundamental_force. Dry friction arises from a
combination of inter-surface adhesion, surface roughness, surface deformation,
and surface contamination. The complexity of these interactions makes the
calculation of friction from first_principles impractical and necessitates the
use of empirical_methods for analysis and the development of theory.
Friction is a non-conservative_force - work done against friction is path
dependent. In the presence of friction, some kinetic energy is always
transformed to thermal energy, so mechanical_energy is not conserved.

***** History *****
The Greeks, including Aristotle, Vitruvius, and Pliny_the_Elder, were
interested in the cause and mitigation of friction.[8] They were aware of
differences between static and kinetic friction with Themistius stating in 350
A.D. that "it is easier to further the motion of a moving body than to move a
body at rest".[8][9][10][11]
The classic laws of sliding friction were discovered by Leonardo_da_Vinci in
1493, a pioneer in tribology, but the laws documented in his notebooks, were
not published and remained unknown.[12][13][14][15][16][17] These laws were
rediscovered by Guillaume_Amontons in 1699[18] and became known as Amonton's
three laws of dry friction (below). Amontons presented the nature of friction
in terms of surface irregularities and the force required to raise the weight
pressing the surfaces together. This view was further elaborated by Bernard
Forest_de_BÃ©lidor[19] and Leonhard_Euler (1750), who derived the angle_of
repose of a weight on an inclined plane and first distinguished between static
and kinetic friction.[20] John_Theophilus_Desaguliers (1734) first recognized
the role of adhesion in friction.[21] Microscopic forces cause surfaces to
stick together; he proposed that friction was the force necessary to tear the
adhering surfaces apart.
The understanding of friction was further developed by Charles-Augustin_de
Coulomb (1785).[22] Coulomb investigated the influence of four main factors on
friction: the nature of the materials in contact and their surface coatings;
the extent of the surface area; the normal pressure (or load); and the length
of time that the surfaces remained in contact (time of repose).[12] Coulomb
further considered the influence of sliding velocity, temperature and humidity,
in order to decide between the different explanations on the nature of friction
that had been proposed. The distinction between static and dynamic friction is
made in Coulomb's friction law (see below), although this distinction was
already drawn by Johann_Andreas_von_Segner in 1758.[12] The effect of the time
of repose was explained by Pieter_van_Musschenbroek (1762) by considering the
surfaces of fibrous materials, with fibers meshing together, which takes a
finite time in which the friction increases.
John_Leslie (1766â1832) noted a weakness in the views of Amontons and
Coulomb: If friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of
successive asperities, why then isn't it balanced through descending the
opposite slope? Leslie was equally skeptical about the role of adhesion
proposed by Desaguliers, which should on the whole have the same tendency to
accelerate as to retard the motion.[12] In Leslie's view, friction should be
seen as a time-dependent process of flattening, pressing down asperities, which
creates new obstacles in what were cavities before.
Arthur_Jules_Morin (1833) developed the concept of sliding versus rolling
friction. Osborne_Reynolds (1866) derived the equation of viscous flow. This
completed the classic empirical model of friction (static, kinetic, and fluid)
commonly used today in engineering.[13] In 1877, Fleeming_Jenkin and J._A.
Ewing investigated the continuity between static and kinetic friction.[23]
The focus of research during the 20th_century has been to understand the
physical mechanisms behind friction. Frank_Philip_Bowden and David_Tabor (1950)
showed that, at a microscopic_level, the actual area of contact between
surfaces is a very small fraction of the apparent area.[14] This actual area of
contact, caused by asperities increases with pressure. The development of the
atomic_force_microscope (ca. 1986) enabled scientists to study friction at the
atomic_scale,[13] showing that, on that scale, dry friction is the product of
the inter-surface shear_stress and the contact area. These two discoveries
explain Amonton's first law (below); the macroscopic proportionality between
normal force and static frictional force between dry surfaces.
***** Laws of dry friction *****
The elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by
experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical
laws:
    * Amontons' First Law: The force of friction is directly proportional to
      the applied load.
    * Amontons' Second Law: The force of friction is independent of the
      apparent area of contact.
    * Coulomb's Law of Friction: Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding
      velocity.
***** Dry friction *****
Dry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact.
The two regimes of dry friction are 'static friction' ("stiction") between non-
moving surfaces, and kinetic friction (sometimes called sliding friction or
dynamic friction) between moving surfaces.
Coulomb friction, named after Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb, is an approximate
model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:
          F   f    &#x2264; &#x03BC;  F   n    ,   {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm
      {f} }\leq \mu F_{\mathrm {n} },}  [{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\leq
      \mu F_{\mathrm {n} },}]
where
    *     F   f       {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\,}  [F_{\mathrm {f} }\,]
      is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other. It is
      parallel to the surface, in a direction opposite to the net applied
      force.
    *    &#x03BC;    {\displaystyle \mu \,}  [\mu \,] is the coefficient of
      friction, which is an empirical property of the contacting materials,
    *     F   n       {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {n} }\,}  [F_{\mathrm {n} }\,]
      is the normal_force exerted by each surface on the other, directed
      perpendicular (normal) to the surface.
The Coulomb friction      F   f       {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\,}  [F_
{\mathrm {f} }\,] may take any value from zero up to     &#x03BC;  F   n
{\displaystyle \mu F_{\mathrm {n} }\,}  [\mu F_{\mathrm {n} }\,], and the
direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion
that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static
case, the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent
motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such
motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual
frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this
force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as
traction.
The force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement
(for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the
two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a
kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive
wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward;
if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards
along the pavement. Note that it is not the direction of movement of the
vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire
and road.
**** Normal force ****
Free-body_diagram for a block on a ramp. Arrows are vectors indicating
directions and magnitudes of forces. N is the normal force, mg is the force of
gravity, and Ff is the force of friction.
Main article: Normal_force
The normal force is defined as the net force compressing two parallel surfaces
together, and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces. In the simple
case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface, the only component of the
normal force is the force due to gravity, where     N = m g    {\displaystyle
N=mg\,}  [N=mg\,]. In this case, the magnitude of the friction force is the
product of the mass of the object, the acceleration due to gravity, and the
coefficient of friction. However, the coefficient of friction is not a function
of mass or volume; it depends only on the material. For instance, a large
aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block.
However, the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal
force, and hence on the mass of the block.
If an object is on a level surface and the force tending to cause it to slide
is horizontal, the normal force     N    {\displaystyle N\,}  [N\,] between the
object and the surface is just its weight, which is equal to its mass
multiplied by the acceleration due to earth's gravity, g. If the object is on a
tilted surface such as an inclined plane, the normal force is less, because
less of the force of gravity is perpendicular to the face of the plane.
Therefore, the normal force, and ultimately the frictional force, is determined
using vector analysis, usually via a free_body_diagram. Depending on the
situation, the calculation of the normal force may include forces other than
gravity.
**** Coefficient of friction ****
The coefficient of friction (COF), often symbolized by the Greek letter Âµ, is
a dimensionless scalar value which describes the ratio of the force of friction
between two bodies and the force pressing them together. The coefficient of
friction depends on the materials used; for example, ice on steel has a low
coefficient of friction, while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of
friction. Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one. It
is an axiom of the nature of friction between metal surfaces that it is greater
between two surfaces of similar metals than between two surfaces of different
metalsâ hence, brass will have a higher coefficient of friction when moved
against brass, but less if moved against steel or aluminum.[24]
For surfaces at rest relative to each other     &#x03BC; =  &#x03BC;   s
{\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{\mathrm {s} }\,}  [\mu =\mu _{\mathrm {s} }\,], where
&#x03BC;   s       {\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {s} }\,}  [\mu _{\mathrm {s}
}\,] is the coefficient of static friction. This is usually larger than its
kinetic counterpart. The coefficient of static friction exhibited by a pair of
contacting surfaces depends upon the combined effects of material deformation
characteristics and surface_roughness, both of which have their origins in the
chemical_bonding between atoms in each of the bulk materials and between the
material surfaces and any adsorbed_material. The fractality of surfaces, a
parameter describing the scaling behavior of surface asperities, is known to
play an important role in determining the magnitude of the static friction.[1]
For surfaces in relative motion     &#x03BC; =  &#x03BC;   k
{\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{\mathrm {k} }\,}  [\mu =\mu _{\mathrm {k} }\,], where
&#x03BC;   k       {\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {k} }\,}  [\mu _{\mathrm {k}
}\,] is the coefficient of kinetic friction. The Coulomb friction is equal to
F   f       {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\,}  [F_{\mathrm {f} }\,], and the
frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to its
motion relative to the other surface.
Arthur_Morin introduced the term and demonstrated the utility of the
coefficient of friction.[12] The coefficient of friction is an empirical
measurement â it has to be measured experimentally, and cannot be found
through calculations.[citation_needed] Rougher surfaces tend to have higher
effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on
the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient
of static friction is usually larger than that of kinetic friction; in some
sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.
Most dry materials in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3
and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but teflon, for example, can have
a coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an
elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction
coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that Âµ is always < 1,
but this is not true. While in most relevant applications Âµ < 1, a value above
1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface
is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example,
silicone_rubber or acrylic_rubber-coated surfaces have a coefficient of
friction that can be substantially larger than 1.
While it is often stated that the COF is a "material property," it is better
categorized as a "system property." Unlike true material properties (such as
conductivity, dielectric constant, yield strength), the COF for any two
materials depends on system variables like temperature, velocity, atmosphere
and also what are now popularly described as aging and deaging times; as well
as on geometric properties of the interface between the materials, namely
surface_structure.[1] For example, a copper pin sliding against a thick copper
plate can have a COF that varies from 0.6 at low speeds (metal sliding against
metal) to below 0.2 at high speeds when the copper surface begins to melt due
to frictional heating. The latter speed, of course, does not determine the COF
uniquely; if the pin diameter is increased so that the frictional heating is
removed rapidly, the temperature drops, the pin remains solid and the COF rises
to that of a 'low speed' test.[citation_needed]

Under certain conditions some materials have very low friction coefficients. An
example is (highly ordered pyrolytic) graphite which can have a friction
coefficient below 0.01.[34] This ultralow-friction regime is called
superlubricity.
**** Static friction ****
When the mass is not moving, the object experiences static friction. The
friction increases as the applied force increases until the block moves. After
the block moves, it experiences kinetic friction, which is less than the
maximum static friction.
Static friction is friction between two or more solid objects that are not
moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an
object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction,
typically denoted as Î¼s, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic
friction. Static friction is considered to arise as the result of surface
roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These
features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and
result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of
points accounting for only a fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area.
The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity
deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and
normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.[35]
The static friction force must be overcome by an applied force before an object
can move. The maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before
sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of static friction and the
normal force:      F  m a x   =  &#x03BC;   s     F  n      {\displaystyle F_
{max}=\mu _{\mathrm {s} }F_{n}\,}  [F_{max}=\mu _{\mathrm {s} }F_{n}\,]. When
there is no sliding occurring, the friction force can have any value from zero
up to      F  m a x      {\displaystyle F_{max}\,}  [F_{{max}}\,]. Any force
smaller than      F  m a x      {\displaystyle F_{max}\,}  [F_{{max}}\,]
attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force
of equal magnitude and opposite direction. Any force larger than      F  m a x
{\displaystyle F_{max}\,}  [F_{{max}}\,] overcomes the force of static friction
and causes sliding to occur. The instant sliding occurs, static friction is no
longer applicableâthe friction between the two surfaces is then called
kinetic friction.
An example of static friction is the force that prevents a car wheel from
slipping as it rolls on the ground. Even though the wheel is in motion, the
patch of the tire in contact with the ground is stationary relative to the
ground, so it is static rather than kinetic friction.
The maximum value of static friction, when motion is impending, is sometimes
referred to as limiting friction,[36] although this term is not used
universally.[3]
**** Kinetic friction ****
Kinetic friction, also known as dynamic friction or sliding friction, occurs
when two objects are moving relative to each other and rub together (like a
sled on the ground). The coefficient of kinetic friction is typically denoted
as Î¼k, and is usually less than the coefficient of static friction for the
same materials.[37][38] However, Richard_Feynman comments that "with dry metals
it is very hard to show any difference."[39] The friction force between two
surfaces after sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of kinetic
friction and the normal force:      F  k   =  &#x03BC;   k     F  n
{\displaystyle F_{k}=\mu _{\mathrm {k} }F_{n}\,}  [F_{k}=\mu _{\mathrm {k} }F_
{n}\,].
New models are beginning to show how kinetic friction can be greater than
static friction.[40] Kinetic friction is now understood, in many cases, to be
primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than
interlocking asperities;[41] however, in many other cases roughness effects are
dominant, for example in rubber to road friction.[40] Surface roughness and
contact area affect kinetic friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where
surface area forces dominate inertial forces.[42]
The origin of kinetic friction at nanoscale can be explained by thermodynamics.
[43] Upon sliding, new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact, and
existing surface disappears at the front of it. Since all surfaces involve the
thermodynamic surface energy, work must be spent in creating the new surface,
and energy is released as heat in removing the surface. Thus, a force is
required to move the back of the contact, and frictional heat is released at
the front.
Angle of friction, Î¸, when block just starts to slide.
**** Angle of friction ****
For the maximum angle of static friction between granular materials, see Angle
of_repose.
For certain applications, it is more useful to define static friction in terms
of the maximum angle before which one of the items will begin sliding. This is
called the angle of friction or friction angle. It is defined as:
         tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  =  &#x03BC;   s       {\displaystyle \tan
      {\theta }=\mu _{\mathrm {s} }\,}  [\tan {\theta }=\mu _{\mathrm {s} }\,]
where Î¸ is the angle from horizontal and Âµs is the static coefficient of
friction between the objects.[44] This formula can also be used to calculate
Âµs from empirical measurements of the friction angle.
**** Friction at the atomic level ****
Determining the forces required to move atoms past each other is a challenge in
designing nanomachines. In 2008 scientists for the first time were able to move
a single atom across a surface, and measure the forces required. Using
ultrahigh vacuum and nearly zero temperature (5Âº K), a modified atomic force
microscope was used to drag a cobalt atom, and a carbon_monoxide molecule,
across surfaces of copper and platinum.[45]
**** Limitations of the Coulomb model ****
The Coulomb approximation follows from the assumptions that: surfaces are in
atomically close contact only over a small fraction of their overall area; that
this contact_area is proportional to the normal force (until saturation, which
takes place when all area is in atomic contact); and that the frictional force
is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the contact area.
The Coulomb approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a
rule-of-thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated
physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and
versatility. Though the relationship between normal force and frictional force
is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent
of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate
representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.
When the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor
approximation (for example, adhesive_tape resists sliding even when there is no
normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force
may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag_racing tires are adhesive
for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics
behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many
applications.
*** "Negative" coefficient of friction ***
As of 2012[update], a single study has demonstrated the potential for an
effectively negative coefficient of friction in the low-load regime, meaning
that a decrease in normal force leads to an increase in friction. This
contradicts everyday experience in which an increase in normal force leads to
an increase in friction.[46] This was reported in the journal Nature in October
2012 and involved the friction encountered by an atomic force microscope stylus
when dragged across a graphene sheet in the presence of graphene-adsorbed
oxygen.[46]
**** Numerical simulation of the Coulomb model ****
Despite being a simplified model of friction, the Coulomb model is useful in
many numerical_simulation applications such as multibody_systems and granular
material. Even its most simple expression encapsulates the fundamental effects
of sticking and sliding which are required in many applied cases, although
specific algorithms have to be designed in order to efficiently numerically
integrate mechanical systems with Coulomb friction and bilateral or unilateral
contact.[47][48][49][50][51] Some quite nonlinear_effects, such as the so-
called PainlevÃ©_paradoxes, may be encountered with Coulomb friction.[52]
**** Dry friction and instabilities ****
Dry friction can induce several types of instabilities in mechanical systems
which display a stable behaviour in the absence of friction.[53] These
instabilities may be caused by the decrease of the friction force with an
increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation
during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects
of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The
latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George_G._Adams and JoÃ£o_ArmÃ©nio
Correia_Martins for smooth surfaces[54][55] and were later found in periodic
rough surfaces.[56] In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are
thought to be responsible for brake_squeal and the 'song' of a glass_harp,[57]
[58] phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of friction
coefficient with velocity.[59]
A practically important case is the self-oscillation of the strings of bowed
instruments such as the violin, cello, hurdy-gurdy, erhu, etc.
A connection between dry friction and flutter instability in a simple
mechanical system has been discovered,[60] watch the movie for more details.
Frictional instabilities can lead to the formation of new self-organized
patterns (or "secondary structures") at the sliding interface, such as in-situ
formed tribofilms which are utilized for the reduction of friction and wear in
so-called self-lubricating materials.[61]
***** Fluid friction *****
Main article: Viscosity
Fluid friction occurs between fluid layers that are moving relative to each
other. This internal resistance to flow is named viscosity. In everyday terms,
the viscosity of a fluid is described as its "thickness". Thus, water is
"thin", having a lower viscosity, while honey is "thick", having a higher
viscosity. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of deformation or
movement.
All real fluids (except superfluids) offer some resistance to shearing and
therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes it is helpful to
use the concept of an inviscid fluid or an ideal_fluid which offers no
resistance to shearing and so is not viscous.
***** Lubricated friction *****
Main article: Lubrication
Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a fluid separates two
solid surfaces. Lubrication is a technique employed to reduce wear of one or
both surfaces in close proximity moving relative to each another by interposing
a substance called a lubricant between the surfaces.
In most cases the applied load is carried by pressure generated within the
fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating
fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous
operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or
seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components
can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or
failure.
***** Skin friction *****
Main article: Parasitic_drag
Skin friction arises from the interaction between the fluid and the skin of the
body, and is directly related to the area of the surface of the body that is in
contact with the fluid. Skin friction follows the drag_equation and rises with
the square of the velocity.
Skin friction is caused by viscous drag in the boundary_layer around the
object. There are two ways to decrease skin friction: the first is to shape the
moving body so that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method
is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is
practicable.
***** Internal friction *****
Main article: Plastic_deformation_of_solids
See also: Deformation_(engineering)
Internal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up
a solid material while it undergoes deformation.
Plastic_deformation in solids is an irreversible change in the internal
molecular structure of an object. This change may be due to either (or both) an
applied force or a change in temperature. The change of an object's shape is
called strain. The force causing it is called stress.
Elastic_deformation in solids is reversible change in the internal molecular
structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As
deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the applied
stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied
force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to
its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic
deformation or elasticity.
***** Radiation friction *****
As a consequence of light pressure, Einstein[62] in 1909 predicted the
existence of "radiation friction" which would oppose the movement of matter. He
wrote, âradiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces
of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest.
However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface
that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The
backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger
than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the
two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and
that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant
'radiation friction' in brief.â
***** Other types of friction *****
**** Rolling resistance ****
Main article: Rolling_resistance
Rolling resistance is the force that resists the rolling of a wheel or other
circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object or
surface. Generally the force of rolling resistance is less than that associated
with kinetic friction.[63] Typical values for the coefficient of rolling
resistance are 0.001.[64] One of the most common examples of rolling resistance
is the movement of motor_vehicle tires on a road, a process which generates
heat and sound as by-products.[65]
**** Braking friction ****
Any wheel equipped with a brake is capable of generating a large retarding
force, usually for the purpose of slowing and stopping a vehicle or piece of
rotating machinery. Braking friction differs from rolling friction because the
coefficient of friction for rolling friction is small whereas the coefficient
of friction for braking friction is designed to be large by choice of materials
for brake_pads.
**** Triboelectric effect ****
Main article: Triboelectric_effect
Rubbing dissimilar materials against one another can cause a build-up of
electrostatic_charge, which can be hazardous if flammable gases or vapours are
present. When the static build-up discharges, explosions can be caused by
ignition of the flammable mixture.
**** Belt friction ****
Main article: Belt_friction
Belt friction is a physical property observed from the forces acting on a belt
wrapped around a pulley, when one end is being pulled. The resulting tension,
which acts on both ends of the belt, can be modeled by the belt friction
equation.
In practice, the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by
the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can
support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or
rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain
climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction
when accomplishing basic tasks.
***** Reducing friction *****
**** Devices ****
Devices such as wheels, ball_bearings, roller_bearings, and air cushion or
other types of fluid_bearings can change sliding friction into a much smaller
type of rolling friction.
Many thermoplastic materials such as nylon, HDPE and PTFE are commonly used in
low friction bearings. They are especially useful because the coefficient of
friction falls with increasing imposed load[66]. For improved wear resistance,
very high molecular_weight grades are usually specified for heavy duty or
critical bearings.
**** Lubricants ****
A common way to reduce friction is by using a lubricant, such as oil, water, or
grease, which is placed between the two surfaces, often dramatically lessening
the coefficient of friction. The science of friction and lubrication is called
tribology. Lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the
application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives.
Superlubricity, a recently discovered effect, has been observed in graphite: it
is the substantial decrease of friction between two sliding objects,
approaching zero levels. A very small amount of frictional energy would still
be dissipated.
Lubricants to overcome friction need not always be thin, turbulent fluids or
powdery solids such as graphite and talc; acoustic_lubrication actually uses
sound as a lubricant.
Another way to reduce friction between two parts is to superimpose micro-scale
vibration to one of the parts. This can be sinusoidal vibration as used in
ultrasound-assisted cutting or vibration noise, known as dither.
***** Energy of friction *****
According to the law of conservation_of_energy, no energy is destroyed due to
friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed
from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest
because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal
energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many
early philosophers, including Aristotle, wrongly concluded that moving objects
lose energy without a driving force.
When an object is pushed along a surface along a path C, the energy converted
to heat is given by a line_integral, in accordance with the definition of work
          E  t h   =  &#x222B;  C     F    f r i c    (  x  ) &#x22C5; d  x
      &#xA0; =  &#x222B;  C    &#x03BC;   k    &#xA0;   F    n    (  x  )
      &#x22C5; d  x  ,   {\displaystyle E_{th}=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} _{\mathrm
      {fric} }(\mathbf {x} )\cdot d\mathbf {x} \ =\int _{C}\mu _{\mathrm {k} }\
      \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {n} }(\mathbf {x} )\cdot d\mathbf {x} ,}  [
      {\displaystyle E_{th}=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {fric} }(\mathbf {x}
      )\cdot d\mathbf {x} \ =\int _{C}\mu _{\mathrm {k} }\ \mathbf {F} _
      {\mathrm {n} }(\mathbf {x} )\cdot d\mathbf {x} ,}]
where
           F    f r i c       {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {fric} }\,}
      [\mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {fric} }\,] is the friction force,
           F    n       {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {n} }\,}  [\mathbf
      {F} _{\mathrm {n} }\,] is the vector obtained by multiplying the
      magnitude of the normal force by a unit vector pointing against the
      object's motion,
          &#x03BC;   k       {\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {k} }\,}  [\mu _
      {\mathrm {k} }\,] is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which is inside
      the integral because it may vary from location to location (e.g. if the
      material changes along the path),
          x     {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \,}  [\mathbf {x} \,] is the
      position of the object.
Energy lost to a system as a result of friction is a classic example of
thermodynamic irreversibility.
**** Work of friction ****
In the reference frame of the interface between two surfaces, static friction
does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the
same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the
motion, and does negative work.[67] However, friction can do positive work in
certain frames_of_reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug,
then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards
relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in
which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and
rug accelerates the box in the same direction that the box moves, doing
positive work.[68]
The work done by friction can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that
can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction
between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of
friction is used to mix and join materials such as in the process of friction
welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work
due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion
particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting)
exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result
from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due
to friction, fit and surface_finish of an object may degrade until it no longer
functions properly.[69]
***** Applications *****
Friction is an important factor in many engineering disciplines.
**** Transportation ****
    * Automobile_brakes inherently rely on friction, slowing a vehicle by
      converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this
      large amount of heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake
      systems. Disk_brakes rely on friction between a disc and brake_pads that
      are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In drum_brakes,
      brake_shoes or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder
      (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more
      efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping
      performance.[70]
    * Rail_adhesion refers to the grip wheels of a train have on the rails, see
      Frictional_contact_mechanics.
    * Road_slipperiness is an important design and safety factor for
      automobiles[71]
          o Split_friction is a particularly dangerous condition arising due to
            varying friction on either side of a car.
          o Road_texture affects the interaction of tires and the driving
            surface.
**** Measurement ****
    * A tribometer is an instrument that measures friction on a surface.
    * A profilograph is a device used to measure pavement surface roughness.
**** Household usage ****
    * Friction is used to heat and ignite matchsticks (friction between the
      head of a matchstick and the rubbing surface of the match box).[72]
    * Sticky_pads are used to prevent object from slipping off smooth surfaces
      by effectively increasing the friction coefficient between the surface
      and the object.
