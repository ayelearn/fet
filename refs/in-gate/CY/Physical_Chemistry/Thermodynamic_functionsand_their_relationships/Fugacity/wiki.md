Effective partial pressure
In chemical_thermodynamics, the fugacity of a real_gas is an effective partial
pressure which replaces the mechanical partial pressure in an accurate
computation of the chemical equilibrium constant. It is equal to the pressure
of an ideal_gas which has the same temperature and molar Gibbs_free_energy as
the real gas.[1]
Fugacities are determined experimentally or estimated from various models such
as a Van_der_Waals_gas that are closer to reality than an ideal gas. The real
gas pressure and fugacity are related through the dimensionless fugacity
coefficient Ï.[1]
         &#x03C6; =   f P      {\displaystyle \varphi ={\frac {f}{P}}\,}  [
      {\displaystyle \varphi ={\frac {f}{P}}\,}]
For an ideal gas, fugacity and pressure are equal and so Ï = 1. Taken at the
same temperature and pressure, the difference between the molar Gibbs free
energies of a real gas and the corresponding ideal gas is equal to RT ln Ï.
The fugacity is closely related to the thermodynamic_activity. For a gas, the
activity is simply the fugacity divided by a reference pressure to give a
dimensionless quantity. This reference pressure is called the standard_state
and normally chosen as 1 atmosphere or 1 bar.
Accurate calculations of chemical_equilibrium for real gases should use the
fugacity rather than the pressure. The thermodynamic condition for chemical
equilibrium is that the total chemical potential of reactants is equal to that
of products. If the chemical potential of each gas is expressed as a function
of fugacity, the equilibrium condition may be transformed into the familiar
reaction_quotient form (or law_of_mass_action) except that the pressures are
replaced by fugacities.
For a condensed phase (liquid or solid) in equilibrium with its vapor phase,
the chemical potential is equal to that of the vapor, and therefore the
fugacity is equal to the fugacity of the vapor. This fugacity is approximately
equal to the vapor_pressure when the vapor pressure is not too high.

***** Pure substance[edit] *****
Fugacity is closely related to the chemical_potential Î¼. In a pure substance,
Î¼ is equal to the Gibbs_energy Gm for a mole of the substance,[2]:207 and
         d &#x03BC; = d  G   m    = &#x2212;  S   m    d T +  V   m    d P
      {\displaystyle d\mu =dG_{\mathrm {m} }=-S_{\mathrm {m} }dT+V_{\mathrm {m}
      }dP}  [{\displaystyle d\mu =dG_{\mathrm {m} }=-S_{\mathrm {m} }dT+V_
      {\mathrm {m} }dP}],
where T and P are the temperature and pressure, Vm is the volume_per_mole and
Sm is the entropy per mole.[2]:248
**** Gas[edit] ****
An ideal_gas has the equation_of_state
          V   m     i d e a l    =    R T  P     {\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {m}
      }^{\mathrm {ideal} }={\frac {RT}{P}}}  [{\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {m} }^
      {\mathrm {ideal} }={\frac {RT}{P}}}],
where R is the ideal_gas_constant. At constant temperature (dT = 0),
         d &#x03BC; = R T d ln &#x2061; P .   {\displaystyle d\mu =RTd\ln P.}
      [{\displaystyle d\mu =RTd\ln P.}]
This equation is very useful but is only accurate when gas molecules are small
compared to the distances between them and rebound elastically off each other.
Gases behave most like ideal gases at low pressures and high temperatures.[3]
At moderately high pressures, attractive interactions between molecules reduce
the pressure compared to the ideal gas law; and at very high pressures, the
sizes of the molecules are no longer negligible and repulsive forces between
molecules increases the pressure. At low temperatures, molecules are more
likely to stick together instead of rebounding elastically.[4]
The ideal gas law can still be used to describe the behavior of a real_gas if
the pressure is replaced by a fugacity f, defined so that
         d &#x03BC; = R T d ln &#x2061; f   {\displaystyle d\mu =RTd\ln f}  [
      {\displaystyle d\mu =RTd\ln f}]
and
          lim  P &#x2192; 0     f P   = 1.   {\displaystyle \lim _{P\to 0}
      {\frac {f}{P}}=1.}  [{\displaystyle \lim _{P\to 0}{\frac {f}{P}}=1.}]
That is, at low pressures f is the same as the pressure, so it has the same
units as pressure. The ratio
         &#x03C6; =   f P     {\displaystyle \varphi ={\frac {f}{P}}}  [
      {\displaystyle \varphi ={\frac {f}{P}}}]
is called the fugacity coefficient.[2]:248â249
If a reference state is denoted by a zero superscript, then integrating the
equation for the chemical potential gives
         &#x03BC; &#x2212;  &#x03BC;  0   = R T ln &#x2061; a ,
      {\displaystyle \mu -\mu ^{0}=RT\ln a,}  [{\displaystyle \mu -\mu ^
      {0}=RT\ln a,}]
where a, a dimensionless quantity, is called the activity.[5]:37
Numerical example: Nitrogen gas (N2) at 0 Â°C and a pressure of P = 100
atmospheres (atm) has a fugacity of f = 97.03 atm.[1] This means that the molar
Gibbs energy of real nitrogen at a pressure of 100 atm is equal to the molar
Gibbs energy of nitrogen as an ideal gas at 97.03 atm. The fugacity coefficient
is 97.03 atm / 100 atm = 0.9703.
The contribution of nonideality to the molar Gibbs energy of a real gas is
equal to RT ln Ï. For nitrogen at 100 atm, Gm = Gm,id + RT ln 0.9703, which is
less than the ideal value Gm,id because of intermolecular attractive forces.
Finally, the activity is just 97.03 without units.
**** Condensed phase[edit] ****
See also: Vaporâliquid_equilibrium
The fugacity of a condensed phase (liquid or solid) is defined the same way as
for a gas:
         d  &#x03BC;   c    = R T d ln &#x2061;  f   c      {\displaystyle d\mu
      _{\mathrm {c} }=RTd\ln f_{\mathrm {c} }}  [{\displaystyle d\mu _{\mathrm
      {c} }=RTd\ln f_{\mathrm {c} }}]
and
          lim  P &#x2192; 0      f   c    P   = 1.   {\displaystyle \lim _{P\to
      0}{\frac {f_{\mathrm {c} }}{P}}=1.}  [{\displaystyle \lim _{P\to 0}{\frac
      {f_{\mathrm {c} }}{P}}=1.}]
It is difficult to measure fugacity in a condensed phase directly; but if the
condensed phase is saturated (in equilibrium with the vapor phase), the
chemical potentials of the two phases are equal (μc = μg). Combined with the
above definition, this implies that
          f   c    =  f   g    .   {\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {c} }=f_{\mathrm
      {g} }.}  [{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {c} }=f_{\mathrm {g} }.}]
When calculating the fugacity of the compressed phase, one can generally assume
the volume is constant. At constant temperature, the change in fugacity as the
pressure goes from the saturation press Psat to P is
         ln &#x2061;   f  f   s a t      =    V   m     R T     &#x222B;   P
      s a t      P   d p =    V  (  P &#x2212;  P   s a t     )    R T    .
      {\displaystyle \ln {\frac {f}{f_{\mathrm {sat} }}}={\frac {V_{\mathrm {m}
      }}{RT}}\int _{P_{\mathrm {sat} }}^{P}dp={\frac {V\left(P-P_{\mathrm {sat}
      }\right)}{RT}}.}  [{\displaystyle \ln {\frac {f}{f_{\mathrm {sat} }}}=
      {\frac {V_{\mathrm {m} }}{RT}}\int _{P_{\mathrm {sat} }}^{P}dp={\frac
      {V\left(P-P_{\mathrm {sat} }\right)}{RT}}.}]
This fraction is known as the Poynting_factor. Using fsat = ÏsatPsat, where
Ïsat is the fugacity coefficient,
         f =  &#x03C6;   s a t     P   s a t    exp &#x2061;  (    V  (  P
      &#x2212;  P   s a t     )    R T    )  .   {\displaystyle f=\varphi _
      {\mathrm {sat} }P_{\mathrm {sat} }\exp \left({\frac {V\left(P-P_{\mathrm
      {sat} }\right)}{RT}}\right).}  [{\displaystyle f=\varphi _{\mathrm {sat}
      }P_{\mathrm {sat} }\exp \left({\frac {V\left(P-P_{\mathrm {sat} }\right)}
      {RT}}\right).}]
This equation allows the fugacity to be calculated using tabulated values for
saturated vapor pressure. Often the pressure is low enough for the vapor phase
to be considered an ideal gas, so the fugacity coefficient is approximately
equal to 1.[6]:345â346[7]
Unless pressures are very high, the Poynting factor is usually small and the
exponential term is near 1. Frequently, the fugacity of the pure liquid is used
as a reference state when defining and using mixture activity coefficients.
***** Mixture[edit] *****
The fugacity is most useful in mixtures. It does not add any new information
compared to the chemical potential, but it has computational advantages. As the
molar fraction of a component goes to zero, the chemical potential diverges but
the fugacity goes to zero. In addition, there are natural reference states for
fugacity (for example, an ideal gas makes a natural reference state for gas
mixtures since the fugacity and pressure converge at low pressure).[8]:141
**** Gases[edit] ****
In a mixture of gases, the fugacity of each component i has a similar
definition, with partial_molar_quantities instead of molar quantities (e.g., Gi
instead of Gm and Vi instead of Vm):[2]:262
         d  G  i   = R T d ln &#x2061;  f  i     {\displaystyle dG_{i}=RTd\ln
      f_{i}}  [{\displaystyle dG_{i}=RTd\ln f_{i}}]
and
          lim  P &#x2192; 0      f  i    P  i     = 1 ,   {\displaystyle \lim _
      {P\to 0}{\frac {f_{i}}{P_{i}}}=1,}  [{\displaystyle \lim _{P\to 0}{\frac
      {f_{i}}{P_{i}}}=1,}]
where Pi is the partial_pressure of component i. The partial pressures obey
Dalton's_law:
          P  i   =  y  i   P ,   {\displaystyle P_{i}=y_{i}P,}  [{\displaystyle
      P_{i}=y_{i}P,}]
where P is the total pressure and yi is the mole fraction of the component (so
the partial pressures add up to the total pressure). The fugacities commonly
obey a similar law called the Lewis and Randall rule:
          f  i   =  y  i    f  i   &#x2217;   ,   {\displaystyle f_{i}=y_{i}f_
      {i}^{*},}  [{\displaystyle f_{i}=y_{i}f_{i}^{*},}]
where f*i is the fugacity that component i would have if the entire gas had
that composition at the same temperature and pressure. Both laws are
expressions of an assumption that the gases behave independently.[2]:264â265
**** Liquids[edit] ****
In a liquid mixture, the fugacity of each component is equal to that of a vapor
component in equilibrium with the liquid. In an ideal_solution, the fugacities
obey Raoult's_law:
          f  i   =  x  i    f  i   &#x2217;   ,   {\displaystyle f_{i}=x_{i}f_
      {i}^{*},}  [{\displaystyle f_{i}=x_{i}f_{i}^{*},}]
where xi is the mole fraction in the liquid and f*i is the fugacity of the pure
vapor phase. This is a good approximation when the component molecules have
similar size, shape and polarity.[2]:264,269â270
In a dilute solution with two components, the component with the larger molar
fraction (the solvent) may still obey Raoult's law even if the other component
(the solute) has different properties. That is because its molecules experience
essentially the same environment that they do in the absence of the solute. By
contrast, each solute molecule is surrounded by solvent molecules, so it obeys
a different law known as Henry's_law.[9]:171 By Henry's law, the fugacity of
the solute is proportional to its concentration. The constant of
proportionality depends on whether the concentration is represented by the mole
fraction, molality or molarity.[2]:274
***** Temperature and pressure dependence[edit] *****
The pressure dependence of fugacity (at constant temperature) is given by[2]:
260
           (    &#x2202; ln &#x2061; f   &#x2202; P    )   T   =    V   m     R
      T      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \ln f}{\partial P}}\right)_
      {T}={\frac {V_{\mathrm {m} }}{RT}}}  [{\displaystyle \left({\frac
      {\partial \ln f}{\partial P}}\right)_{T}={\frac {V_{\mathrm {m} }}{RT}}}]
and is always positive.[2]:260
The temperature dependence at constant pressure is
           (    &#x2202; ln &#x2061; f   &#x2202; T    )   P   =    &#x0394;  H
      m      R  T  2      ,   {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \ln f}
      {\partial T}}\right)_{P}={\frac {\Delta H_{\mathrm {m} }}{RT^{2}}},}  [
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \ln f}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}=
      {\frac {\Delta H_{\mathrm {m} }}{RT^{2}}},}]
where Δ Hm is the change in molar enthalpy as the gas expands, liquid
vaporizes, or solid sublimates into a vacuum.[2]:262 Also, if the pressure is
p0, then
           (    &#x2202;  (  T ln &#x2061; ( f  /   p  0   )  )    &#x2202; T
      )   P   = &#x2212;    S   m    R   < 0.   {\displaystyle \left({\frac
      {\partial \left(T\ln(f/p^{0})\right)}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}=-{\frac {S_
      {\mathrm {m} }}{R}}<0.}  [{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial \left
      (T\ln(f/p^{0})\right)}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}=-{\frac {S_{\mathrm {m} }}
      {R}}<0.}]
Since the temperature and entropy are positive, ln (f/p0) decreases with
increasing temperature.[10]
***** Relationship to entropy[edit] *****
Fugacity, activity, and chemical_potential are very closely related to entropy.
Specifically, the fugacity of a species (divided by the reference pressure) is
the partial geometric_derivative of the dimensionless entropy of the system
with respect to exchanging elementary entities of that component for those of a
pure ideal gas at reference pressure.[citation_needed]
***** Measurement[edit] *****
The fugacity can be deduced from measurements of volume as a function of
pressure at constant temperature. In that case,
         ln &#x2061; &#x03C6; =   1  R T     &#x222B;  0   P    (   V  m
      &#x2212;  V   m     i d e a l     )  d P .   {\displaystyle \ln \varphi =
      {\frac {1}{RT}}\int _{0}^{P}\left(V_{m}-V_{\mathrm {m} }^{\mathrm {ideal}
      }\right)dP.}  [{\displaystyle \ln \varphi ={\frac {1}{RT}}\int _{0}^
      {P}\left(V_{m}-V_{\mathrm {m} }^{\mathrm {ideal} }\right)dP.}]
This integral can also be calculated using an equation of state.[2]:251â252
The integral can be recast in an alternative form using the compressibility
factor
         Z =    P  V   m      R T    .   {\displaystyle Z={\frac {PV_{\mathrm
      {m} }}{RT}}.}  [{\displaystyle Z={\frac {PV_{\mathrm {m} }}{RT}}.}]
Then
         ln &#x2061; &#x03C6; =  &#x222B;  0   P    (    Z &#x2212; 1  P   )  d
      P .   {\displaystyle \ln \varphi =\int _{0}^{P}\left({\frac {Z-1}
      {P}}\right)dP.}  [{\displaystyle \ln \varphi =\int _{0}^{P}\left({\frac
      {Z-1}{P}}\right)dP.}]
This is useful because of the theorem_of_corresponding_states: If the pressure
and temperature at the critical_point of the gas are Pc and Tc, we can define
reduced_properties Pr = P /Pc and Tr = T /Tc. Then, to a good approximation,
most gases have the same value of Z for the same reduced temperature and
pressure. However, in geochemical applications, this principle ceases to be
accurate at pressures where metamorphism occurs.[11]:247
For a gas obeying the van_der_Waals_equation, the explicit formula for the
fugacity coefficient is
         R T ln &#x2061; &#x03C6; =    R T b    V   m    &#x2212; b    &#x2212;
      2 a   V   m      &#x2212; R T ln &#x2061;  (  1 &#x2212;    a (  V   m
      &#x2212; b )   R T  V   m    2       )    {\displaystyle RT\ln \varphi =
      {\frac {RTb}{V_{\mathrm {m} }-b}}-{\frac {2a}{V_{\mathrm {m} }}}-RT\ln
      \left(1-{\frac {a(V_{\mathrm {m} }-b)}{RTV_{\mathrm {m} }^{2}}}\right)}
      [{\displaystyle RT\ln \varphi ={\frac {RTb}{V_{\mathrm {m} }-b}}-{\frac
      {2a}{V_{\mathrm {m} }}}-RT\ln \left(1-{\frac {a(V_{\mathrm {m} }-b)}{RTV_
      {\mathrm {m} }^{2}}}\right)}]
This formula is difficult to use, since the pressure depends on the molar
volume through the equation of state; so one must choose a volume, calculate
the pressure, and then use these two values on the right-hand side of the
equation.[12]
***** History[edit] *****
The word fugacity is derived from the Latin fugere, to flee. In the sense of an
"escaping tendency", it was introduced to thermodynamics in 1901 by the
American chemist Gilbert_N._Lewis and popularized in an influential textbook by
Lewis and Merle_Randall, Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical
Substances, in 1923.[13] The "escaping tendency" referred to the flow of matter
between phases and played a similar role to that of temperature in heat flow.
