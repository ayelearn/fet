A hydrogen atom is an atom of the chemical_element hydrogen. The electrically
neutral atom contains a single positively charged proton and a single
negatively charged electron bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb_force. Atomic
hydrogen constitutes about_75% of the baryonic mass of the universe.[1]
In everyday life on Earth, isolated hydrogen atoms (called "atomic hydrogen")
are extremely rare. Instead, a hydrogen atom tends to combine with other atoms
in compounds, or with another hydrogen atom to form ordinary (diatomic)
hydrogen gas, H2. "Atomic hydrogen" and "hydrogen atom" in ordinary English use
have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. For example, a water molecule
contains two hydrogen atoms, but does not contain atomic hydrogen (which would
refer to isolated hydrogen atoms).
Atomic_spectroscopy shows that there is a discrete infinite set of states in
which a hydrogen (or any) atom can exist, contrary to the predictions of
classical_physics. Attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the
states of the hydrogen atom have been important to the history_of_quantum
mechanics, since all other atoms can be roughly understood by knowing in detail
about this simplest atomic structure.

***** Isotopes[edit] *****
Main article: Isotopes_of_hydrogen
The most abundant isotope, hydrogen-1, protium, or light hydrogen, contains no
neutrons and is simply a proton and an electron. Protium is stable and makes up
99.985% of naturally occurring hydrogen atoms.[2]
Deuterium contains one neutron and one proton. Deuterium is stable and makes up
0.0156% of naturally occurring hydrogen[2] and is used in industrial processes
like nuclear_reactors and Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance.
Tritium contains two neutrons and one proton and is not stable, decaying with a
half-life of 12.32 years. Because of the short half life, tritium does not
exist in nature except in trace amounts.
Higher isotopes of hydrogen are only created in artificial accelerators and
reactors and have half lives around the order of 10â22
(0.0000000000000000000001) second.
The formulas below are valid for all three isotopes of hydrogen, but slightly
different values of the Rydberg_constant (correction formula given below) must
be used for each hydrogen isotope.
***** Hydrogen ion[edit] *****
Main articles: hydrogen_cation and hydrogen_anion
Lone neutral hydrogen atoms are rare under normal conditions. However, neutral
hydrogen is common when it is covalently_bound to another atom, and hydrogen
atoms can also exist in several cationic_and_anionic forms.
If a neutral hydrogen atom loses its electron, it becomes a cation. The
resulting atom, which consists solely of a proton for the usual isotope, is
written as "H+" and sometimes called hydron. Free protons are common in the
interstellar_medium, and solar_wind. In the context of aqueous_solutions of
classical BrÃ¸nstedâLowry_acids, such as hydrochloric_acid, it is actually
hydronium, H3O+, that is meant. Instead of a literal ionized single hydrogen
atom being formed, the acid transfers the hydrogen to H2O, forming H3O+.
If instead a hydrogen atom gains a second electron, it becomes an anion. The
hydrogen_anion is written as "Hâ" and called hydride.
***** Theoretical analysis[edit] *****
The hydrogen atom has special significance in quantum_mechanics and quantum
field_theory as a simple two-body_problem physical system which has yielded
many simple analytical solutions in closed-form.
**** Failed classical description[edit] ****
Experiments by Ernest_Rutherford in 1909 showed the structure of the atom to be
a dense, positive nucleus with a tenuous negative charge cloud around it. This
immediately raised questions about how such a system could be stable. Classical
electromagnetism had shown that any accelerating charge radiates energy, as
shown by the Larmor_formula. If the electron is assumed to orbit in a perfect
circle and radiates energy continuously, the electron would rapidly spiral into
the nucleus with a fall time of:[3]
                t  fall   &#x2248;    a  0   3    4  r  0   2   c    &#x2248;
            1.6 &#x22C5;  10  &#x2212; 11    s    {\displaystyle t_{\text
            {fall}}\approx {\frac {a_{0}^{3}}{4r_{0}^{2}c}}\approx 1.6\cdot 10^
            {-11}{\text{s}}}  [{\displaystyle t_{\text{fall}}\approx {\frac {a_
            {0}^{3}}{4r_{0}^{2}c}}\approx 1.6\cdot 10^{-11}{\text{s}}}]
Where      a  0     {\displaystyle a_{0}}  [a_{0}] is the Bohr_radius and
r  0     {\displaystyle r_{0}}  [r_{0}] is the classical_electron_radius. If
this were true, all atoms would instantly collapse, however atoms seem to be
stable. Furthermore, the spiral inward would release a smear of electromagnetic
frequencies as the orbit got smaller. Instead, atoms were observed to only emit
discrete frequencies of radiation. The resolution would lie in the development
of quantum_mechanics.
**** BohrâSommerfeld Model[edit] ****
Main article: Bohr_model
In 1913, Niels_Bohr obtained the energy levels and spectral frequencies of the
hydrogen atom after making a number of simple assumptions in order to correct
the failed classical model. The assumptions included:
   1. Electrons can only be in certain, discrete circular orbits or stationary
      states, thereby having a discrete set of possible radii and energies.
   2. Electrons do not emit radiation while in one of these stationary states.
   3. An electron can gain or lose energy by jumping from one discrete orbital
      to another.
Bohr supposed that the electron's angular momentum is quantized with possible
values:
               L = n &#x210F;   {\displaystyle L=n\hbar }  [{\displaystyle
            L=n\hbar }] where     n = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . .   {\displaystyle
            n=1,2,3,...}  [{\displaystyle n=1,2,3,...}]
and     &#x210F;   {\displaystyle \hbar }  [\hbar ] is Planck_constant over
2 &#x03C0;   {\displaystyle 2\pi }  [2\pi ]. He also supposed that the
centripetal_force which keeps the electron in its orbit is provided by the
Coulomb_force, and that energy is conserved. Bohr derived the energy of each
orbit of the hydrogen atom to be:[4]
                E  n   = &#x2212;     m  e    e  4     2 ( 4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;
            0    )  2    &#x210F;  2        1  n  2       {\displaystyle E_
            {n}=-{\frac {m_{e}e^{4}}{2(4\pi \epsilon _{0})^{2}\hbar ^{2}}}
            {\frac {1}{n^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle E_{n}=-{\frac {m_{e}e^{4}}{2
            (4\pi \epsilon _{0})^{2}\hbar ^{2}}}{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}}],
where      m  e     {\displaystyle m_{e}}  [{\displaystyle m_{e}}] is the
electron_mass,     e   {\displaystyle e}  [{\displaystyle e}] is the electron
charge,      &#x03F5;  0     {\displaystyle \epsilon _{0}}  [{\displaystyle
\epsilon _{0}}] is the vacuum_permittivity, and     n   {\displaystyle n}  [
{\displaystyle n}] is the quantum_number (now known as the principal_quantum
number). Bohr's predictions matched experiments measuring the hydrogen_spectral
series to the first order, giving more confidence to a theory that used
quantized values.
For     n = 1   {\displaystyle n=1}  [n=1], the value
                   m  e    e  4     2 ( 4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;  0    )  2
            &#x210F;  2      =     m  e    e  4     8  h  2    &#x03B5;  0   2
            = 1   Ry  = 13.605  692  53 ( 30 )   eV    {\displaystyle {\frac
            {m_{e}e^{4}}{2(4\pi \epsilon _{0})^{2}\hbar ^{2}}}={\frac {m_{\text
            {e}}e^{4}}{8h^{2}\varepsilon _{0}^{2}}}=1\,{\text
            {Ry}}=13.605\;692\;53(30)\,{\text{eV}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {m_
            {e}e^{4}}{2(4\pi \epsilon _{0})^{2}\hbar ^{2}}}={\frac {m_{\text
            {e}}e^{4}}{8h^{2}\varepsilon _{0}^{2}}}=1\,{\text
            {Ry}}=13.605\;692\;53(30)\,{\text{eV}}}][5]
is called the Rydberg unit of energy. It is related to the Rydberg_constant
R  &#x221E;     {\displaystyle R_{\infty }}  [{\displaystyle R_{\infty }}] of
atomic_physics by     1   Ry  &#x2261; h c  R  &#x221E;   .   {\displaystyle
1\,{\text{Ry}}\equiv hcR_{\infty }.}  [{\displaystyle 1\,{\text{Ry}}\equiv hcR_
{\infty }.}]
The exact value of the Rydberg constant assumes that the nucleus is infinitely
massive with respect to the electron. For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 (deuterium),
and hydrogen-3 (tritium) which have finite mass, the constant must be slightly
modified to use the reduced_mass of the system, rather than simply the mass of
the electron. This includes the kinetic energy of the nucleus in the problem,
because the total (electron plus nuclear) kinetic energy is equivalent to the
kinetic energy of the reduced mass moving with a velocity equal to the electron
velocity relative to the nucleus. However, since the nucleus is much heavier
than the electron, the electron mass and reduced mass are nearly the same. The
Rydberg constant RM for a hydrogen atom (one electron), R is given by
                R  M   =    R  &#x221E;    1 +  m  e    /  M    ,
            {\displaystyle R_{M}={\frac {R_{\infty }}{1+m_{\text{e}}/M}},}
            [R_M = \frac{R_\infty}{1+m_{\text{e}}/M},]
where     M   {\displaystyle M}  [M] is the mass of the atomic nucleus. For
hydrogen-1, the quantity      m  e    /  M ,   {\displaystyle m_{\text{e}}/M,}
[m_{\text{e}}/M,] is about 1/1836 (i.e. the electron-to-proton mass ratio). For
deuterium and tritium, the ratios are about 1/3670 and 1/5497 respectively.
These figures, when added to 1 in the denominator, represent very small
corrections in the value of R, and thus only small corrections to all energy
levels in corresponding hydrogen isotopes.
There were still problems with Bohr's model:
   1. it failed to predict other spectral details such as fine_structure and
      hyperfine_structure
   2. it could only predict energy levels with any accuracy for
      singleâelectron atoms (hydrogenâlike atoms)
   3. the predicted values were only correct to      &#x03B1;  2   &#x2248;  10
      &#x2212; 5     {\displaystyle \alpha ^{2}\approx 10^{-5}}  [
      {\displaystyle \alpha ^{2}\approx 10^{-5}}], where     &#x03B1;
      {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is the fine-structure_constant.
Most of these shortcomings were resolved by Arnold_Sommerfeld's modification of
the Bohr model. Sommerfeld introduced two additional degrees of freedom,
allowing an electron to move on an elliptical orbit characterized by its
eccentricity and declination with respect to a chosen axis. This introduced two
additional quantum numbers, which correspond to the orbital angular_momentum
and its projection on the chosen axis. Thus the correct multiplicity of states
(except for the factor 2 accounting for the yet unknown electron spin) was
found. Further, by applying special_relativity to the elliptic orbits,
Sommerfeld succeeded in deriving the correct expression for the fine structure
of hydrogen spectra (which happens to be exactly the same as in the most
elaborate Dirac theory). However, some observed phenomena, such as the
anomalous Zeeman_effect, remained unexplained. These issues were resolved with
the full development of quantum mechanics and the Dirac_equation. It is often
alleged that the SchrÃ¶dinger_equation is superior to the BohrâSommerfeld
theory in describing hydrogen atom. This is not the case, as most of the
results of both approaches coincide or are very close (a remarkable exception
is the problem of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields, which
cannot be self-consistently solved in the framework of the BohrâSommerfeld
theory), and in both theories the main shortcomings result from the absence of
the electron spin. It was the complete failure of the BohrâSommerfeld theory
to explain many-electron systems (such as helium atom or hydrogen molecule)
which demonstrated its inadequacy in describing quantum phenomena.

**** SchrÃ¶dinger equation[edit] ****
The SchrÃ¶dinger equation allows one to calculate the stationary states and
also the time evolution of quantum systems. Exact analytical answers are
available for the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom. Before we go to present a
formal account, here we give an elementary overview.
Given that the hydrogen atom contains a nucleus and an electron, quantum
mechanics allows one to predict the probability of finding the electron at any
given radial distance     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r]. It is given by the square
of a mathematical function known as the "wavefunction," which is a solution of
the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. The lowest energy equilibrium state of the hydrogen
atom is known as the ground state. The ground state wave function is known as
the     1  s    {\displaystyle 1\mathrm {s} }  [{\displaystyle 1\mathrm {s} }]
wavefunction. It is written as:
                &#x03C8;  1  s    ( r ) =   1    &#x03C0;    a  0   3  /  2
            e  &#x2212; r  /   a  0       {\displaystyle \psi _{1\mathrm {s} }
            (r)={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {\pi }}a_{0}^{3/2}}}e^{-r/a_{0}}}  [
            {\displaystyle \psi _{1\mathrm {s} }(r)={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {\pi }}a_
            {0}^{3/2}}}e^{-r/a_{0}}}].
Here,      a  0     {\displaystyle a_{0}}  [a_{0}] is the numerical value of
the Bohr radius. The probability of finding the electron at a distance     r
{\displaystyle r}  [r] in any radial direction is the squared value of the
wavefunction:
                |   &#x03C8;  1  s    ( r )   |   2   =   1  &#x03C0;  a  0   3
            e  &#x2212; 2 r  /   a  0       {\displaystyle |\psi _{1\mathrm {s}
            }(r)|^{2}={\frac {1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}e^{-2r/a_{0}}}  [{\displaystyle
            |\psi _{1\mathrm {s} }(r)|^{2}={\frac {1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}e^{-2r/a_
            {0}}}].
The     1  s    {\displaystyle 1\mathrm {s} }  [{\displaystyle 1\mathrm {s} }]
wavefunction is spherically symmetric, and the surface area of a shell at
distance     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] is     4 &#x03C0;  r  2
{\displaystyle 4\pi r^{2}}  [4\pi r^{2}], so the total probability     P ( r )
d r   {\displaystyle P(r)dr}  [{\displaystyle P(r)dr}] of the electron being in
a shell at a distance     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] and thickness     d r
{\displaystyle dr}  [dr] is
               P ( r ) d r = 4 &#x03C0;  r  2    |   &#x03C8;  1  s    ( r )
            |   2   d r   {\displaystyle P(r)dr=4\pi r^{2}|\psi _{1\mathrm {s}
            }(r)|^{2}dr}  [{\displaystyle P(r)dr=4\pi r^{2}|\psi _{1\mathrm {s}
            }(r)|^{2}dr}].
It turns out that this is a maximum at     r =  a  0     {\displaystyle r=a_
{0}}  [{\displaystyle r=a_{0}}]. That is, the Bohr picture of an electron
orbiting the nucleus at radius      a  0     {\displaystyle a_{0}}  [a_{0}] is
recovered as a statistically valid result. However, although the electron is
most likely to be on a Bohr orbit, there is a finite probability that the
electron may be at any other place     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r], with the
probability indicated by the square of the wavefunction. Since the probability
of finding the electron somewhere in the whole volume is unity, the integral of
P ( r ) d r   {\displaystyle P(r)dr}  [{\displaystyle P(r)dr}] is unity. Then
we say that the wavefunction is properly normalized.
As discussed below, the ground state     1  s    {\displaystyle 1\mathrm {s} }
[{\displaystyle 1\mathrm {s} }] is also indicated by the quantum numbers     n
= 1 , l = 0 , m = 0   {\displaystyle n=1,l=0,m=0}  [{\displaystyle
n=1,l=0,m=0}]. The second lowest energy states, just above the ground state,
are given by the quantum numbers     n = 2 , l = 0 , m = 0   {\displaystyle
n=2,l=0,m=0}  [{\displaystyle n=2,l=0,m=0}];     n = 2 , l = 1 , m = 0
{\displaystyle n=2,l=1,m=0}  [{\displaystyle n=2,l=1,m=0}]; and     n = 2 , l =
1 , m = &#x00B1; 1   {\displaystyle n=2,l=1,m=\pm 1}  [{\displaystyle
n=2,l=1,m=\pm 1}]. These     n = 2   {\displaystyle n=2}  [n=2] states all have
the same energy and are known as the     2  s    {\displaystyle 2\mathrm {s} }
[{\displaystyle 2\mathrm {s} }] and     2  p    {\displaystyle 2\mathrm {p} }
[{\displaystyle 2\mathrm {p} }] states. There is one     2  s    {\displaystyle
2\mathrm {s} }  [{\displaystyle 2\mathrm {s} }] state:
                &#x03C8;  2 , 0 , 0   =   1  4   2 &#x03C0;    a  0   3  /  2
            (  2 &#x2212;   r  a  0      )   e  &#x2212; r  /  2  a  0
            {\displaystyle \psi _{2,0,0}={\frac {1}{4{\sqrt {2\pi }}a_{0}^{3/
            2}}}\left(2-{\frac {r}{a_{0}}}\right)e^{-r/2a_{0}}}  [
            {\displaystyle \psi _{2,0,0}={\frac {1}{4{\sqrt {2\pi }}a_{0}^{3/
            2}}}\left(2-{\frac {r}{a_{0}}}\right)e^{-r/2a_{0}}}],
and there are three     2  p    {\displaystyle 2\mathrm {p} }  [{\displaystyle
2\mathrm {p} }] states:
                &#x03C8;  2 , 1 , 0   =   1  4   2 &#x03C0;    a  0   3  /  2
            r  a  0      e  &#x2212; r  /  2  a  0     cos &#x2061; &#x03B8;

            \psi _{2,1,0}={\frac {1}{4{\sqrt {2\pi }}a_{0}^{3/2}}}{\frac {r}{a_

                &#x03C8;  2 , 1 , &#x00B1; 1   =   1  8   &#x03C0;    a  0   3

            {a_{0}}}e^{-r/2a_{0}}\sin \theta ~e^{\pm i\phi }}].
An electron in the     2  s    {\displaystyle 2\mathrm {s} }  [{\displaystyle
2\mathrm {s} }] or     2  p    {\displaystyle 2\mathrm {p} }  [{\displaystyle
2\mathrm {p} }] state is most likely to be found in the second Bohr orbit with
energy given by the Bohr formula.

*** Wavefunction[edit] ***
The Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom is the radial kinetic energy operator and
Coulomb attraction force between the positive proton and negative electron.

The solutions to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for hydrogen are analytical, giving
a simple expression for the hydrogen energy_levels and thus the frequencies of
the hydrogen spectral_lines and fully reproduced the Bohr model and went beyond
it. It also yields two other quantum numbers and the shape of the electron's
wave function ("orbital") for the various possible quantum-mechanical states,
thus explaining the anisotropic character of atomic bonds.
The SchrÃ¶dinger equation also applies to more complicated atoms and molecules.
When there is more than one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical
and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must
be made.
Since the SchrÃ¶dinger equation is only valid for non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, the solutions it yields for the hydrogen atom are not entirely
correct. The Dirac_equation of relativistic quantum theory improves these
solutions (see below).
*** Results of SchrÃ¶dinger equation[edit] ***
The solution of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation (wave equation) for the hydrogen atom
uses the fact that the Coulomb_potential produced by the nucleus is isotropic
(it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the
nucleus). Although the resulting energy_eigenfunctions (the orbitals) are not
necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the angular_coordinates
follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential:
the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (that is, the energy eigenstates) can be
chosen as simultaneous eigenstates of the angular_momentum_operator. This
corresponds to the fact that angular momentum is conserved in the orbital
motion of the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, the energy eigenstates
may be classified by two angular momentum quantum_numbers, â and m (both are
integers). The angular momentum quantum number â = 0, 1, 2, ... determines
the magnitude of the angular momentum. The magnetic quantum number m = ââ,
..., +â determines the projection of the angular momentum on the (arbitrarily
chosen) z-axis.
In addition to mathematical expressions for total angular momentum and angular
momentum projection of wavefunctions, an expression for the radial dependence
of the wave functions must be found. It is only here that the details of the 1/
r Coulomb potential enter (leading to Laguerre_polynomials in r). This leads to
a third quantum number, the principal quantum number n = 1, 2, 3, .... The
principal quantum number in hydrogen is related to the atom's total energy.
Note that the maximum value of the angular momentum quantum number is limited
by the principal quantum number: it can run only up to n â 1, i.e. â = 0,
1, ..., n â 1.
Due to angular momentum conservation, states of the same â but different m
have the same energy (this holds for all problems with rotational_symmetry). In
addition, for the hydrogen atom, states of the same n but different â are
also degenerate (i.e. they have the same energy). However, this is a specific
property of hydrogen and is no longer true for more complicated atoms which
have an (effective) potential differing from the form 1/r (due to the presence
of the inner electrons shielding the nucleus potential).
Taking into account the spin of the electron adds a last quantum number, the
projection of the electron's spin angular momentum along the z-axis, which can
take on two values. Therefore, any eigenstate of the electron in the hydrogen
atom is described fully by four quantum numbers. According to the usual rules
of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any superposition
of these states. This explains also why the choice of z-axis for the
directional quantization of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an
orbital of given â and m′ obtained for another preferred axis z′ can always
be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different m
(but same l) that have been obtained for z.

In 1928, Paul_Dirac found an_equation that was fully compatible with Special
Relativity, and (as a consequence) made the wave function a 4-component "Dirac
spinor" including "up" and "down" spin components, with both positive and
"negative" energy (or matter and antimatter). The solution to this equation
gave the following results, more accurate than the SchrÃ¶dinger solution.
** Energy levels[edit] **
The energy levels of hydrogen, including fine_structure (excluding Lamb_shift
and hyperfine_structure), are given by the Sommerfeld_fine_structure
expression:[12]

where Î± is the fine-structure_constant and j is the "total angular momentum"
quantum_number, which is equal to |â Â± 1/2| depending on the direction of
the electron spin. This formula represents a small correction to the energy
obtained by Bohr and SchrÃ¶dinger as given above. The factor in square brackets
in the last expression is nearly one; the extra term arises from relativistic
effects (for details, see #Features_going_beyond_the_SchrÃ¶dinger_solution). It
is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by A._Sommerfeld in
1916 based on the relativistic version of the old_Bohr_theory. Sommerfeld has
however used different notation for the quantum numbers.

**** Visualizing the hydrogen electron orbitals[edit] ****
Main article: Atomic_orbital
Probability densities through the xz-plane for the electron at different
quantum numbers (â, across top; n, down side; m = 0)
The image to the right shows the first few hydrogen atom orbitals (energy
eigenfunctions). These are cross-sections of the probability_density that are
color-coded (black represents zero density and white represents the highest
density). The angular momentum (orbital) quantum number â is denoted in each
column, using the usual spectroscopic letter code (s means â = 0, p means
â = 1, d means â = 2). The main (principal) quantum number n (= 1, 2, 3,
...) is marked to the right of each row. For all pictures the magnetic quantum
number m has been set to 0, and the cross-sectional plane is the xz-plane (z is
the vertical axis). The probability density in three-dimensional space is
obtained by rotating the one shown here around the z-axis.
The "ground_state", i.e. the state of lowest energy, in which the electron is
usually found, is the first one, the 1s state (principal_quantum_level n = 1,
â = 0).
Black lines occur in each but the first orbital: these are the nodes of the
wavefunction, i.e. where the probability density is zero. (More precisely, the
nodes are spherical_harmonics that appear as a result of solving SchrÃ¶dinger
equation in spherical coordinates.)
The quantum_numbers determine the layout of these nodes.[14] There are:
    *    n &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle n-1}  [n-1] total nodes,
    *    l   {\displaystyle l}  [l] of which are angular nodes:
          o    m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] angular nodes go around the
            &#x03D5;   {\displaystyle \phi }  [\phi ] axis (in the xy plane).
            (The figure above does not show these nodes since it plots cross-
            sections through the xz-plane.)
          o    l &#x2212; m   {\displaystyle l-m}  [l-m] (the remaining angular
            nodes) occur on the     &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle \theta }  [\theta
            ] (vertical) axis.
    *    n &#x2212; l &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle n-l-1}  [n - l - 1] (the
      remaining non-angular nodes) are radial nodes.
*** Features going beyond the SchrÃ¶dinger solution[edit] ***
There are several important effects that are neglected by the SchrÃ¶dinger
equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations
of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:
    * Although the mean speed of the electron in hydrogen is only 1/137th of
      the speed_of_light, many modern experiments are sufficiently precise that
      a complete theoretical explanation requires a fully relativistic
      treatment of the problem. A relativistic treatment results in a momentum
      increase of about 1 part in 37,000 for the electron. Since the electron's
      wavelength is determined by its momentum, orbitals containing higher
      speed electrons show contraction due to smaller wavelengths.
    * Even when there is no external magnetic_field, in the inertial_frame of
      the moving electron, the electromagnetic field of the nucleus has a
      magnetic component. The spin of the electron has an associated magnetic
      moment which interacts with this magnetic field. This effect is also
      explained by special relativity, and it leads to the so-called spin-orbit
      coupling, i.e., an interaction between the electron's orbital_motion
      around the nucleus, and its spin.
Both of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic Dirac
equation, with predictions that come still closer to experiment. Again the
Dirac equation may be solved analytically in the special case of a two-body
system, such as the hydrogen atom. The resulting solution quantum states now
must be classified by the total_angular_momentum_number j (arising through the
coupling between electron_spin and orbital_angular_momentum). States of the
same j and the same n are still degenerate. Thus, direct analytical solution of
Dirac_equation predicts 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) levels of Hydrogen to have exactly
the same energy, which is in a contradiction with observations (Lamb-Retherford
experiment).
    * There are always vacuum_fluctuations of the electromagnetic_field,
      according to quantum mechanics. Due to such fluctuations degeneracy
      between states of the same j but different l is lifted, giving them
      slightly different energies. This has been demonstrated in the famous
      Lamb-Retherford_experiment and was the starting point for the development
      of the theory of quantum_electrodynamics (which is able to deal with
      these vacuum fluctuations and employs the famous Feynman_diagrams for
      approximations using perturbation_theory). This effect is now called Lamb
      shift.
For these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac
equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any
experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of
failure of the theory.
***** Alternatives to the SchrÃ¶dinger theory[edit] *****
In the language of Heisenberg's matrix_mechanics, the hydrogen atom was first
solved by Wolfgang_Pauli[15] using a rotational_symmetry in four dimensions [O
(4)-symmetry] generated by the angular momentum and the LaplaceâRungeâLenz
vector. By extending the symmetry group O(4) to the dynamical_group O(4,2), the
entire spectrum and all transitions were embedded in a single irreducible group
representation.[16]
In 1979 the (non relativistic) hydrogen atom was solved for the first time
within Feynman's path_integral_formulation of quantum_mechanics.[17][18] This
work greatly extended the range of applicability of Feynman's method.
