Separation of a mixture into its component parts
Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component
parts, or fractions. Chemical_compounds are separated by heating them to a
temperature at which one or more fractions of the mixture will vaporize. It
uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling
points that differ by less than 25 Â°C (77 Â°F) from each other under a
pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than
25 Â°C, a simple_distillation is typically used.

***** Laboratory setup[edit] *****
Fractional distillation in a laboratory makes use of common laboratory
glassware and apparatuses, typically including a Bunsen_burner, a round-
bottomed_flask and a condenser, as well as the single-purpose fractionating
column.

**** Discussion[edit] ****
As an example consider the distillation of a mixture of water and ethanol.
Ethanol boils at 78.4 Â°C (173.1 Â°F) while water boils at 100 Â°C (212 Â°F).
So, by heating the mixture, the most volatile component (ethanol) will
concentrate to a greater degree in the vapor leaving the liquid. Some mixtures
form azeotropes, where the mixture boils at a lower temperature than either
component. In this example, a mixture of 96% ethanol and 4% water boils at
78.2 Â°C (172.8 Â°F); the mixture is more volatile than pure ethanol. For this
reason, ethanol cannot be completely purified by direct fractional distillation
of ethanol-water mixtures.
The apparatus is assembled as in the diagram. (The diagram represents a batch
apparatus as opposed to a continuous apparatus.) The mixture is put into the
round bottomed flask along with a few anti-bumping_granules (or a Teflon coated
magnetic stirrer bar if using magnetic stirring), and the fractionating column
is fitted into the top. The fractional distillation column is set up with the
heat source at the bottom on the still pot. As the distance from the stillpot
increases, a temperature gradient is formed in the column; it is coolest at the
top and hottest at the bottom. As the mixed vapor ascends the temperature
gradient, some of the vapor condenses and revaporizes along the temperature
gradient. Each time the vapor condenses and vaporizes, the composition of the
more volatile component in the vapor increases. This distills the vapor along
the length of the column, and eventually the vapor is composed solely of the
more volatile component (or an azeotrope). The vapor condenses on the glass
platforms, known as trays, inside the column, and runs back down into the
liquid below, refluxing distillate. The efficiency in terms of the amount of
heating and time required to get fractionation can be improved by insulating
the outside of the column in an insulator such as wool, aluminium foil or
preferably a vacuum jacket. The hottest tray is at the bottom and the coolest
is at the top. At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray
are at equilibrium. The most volatile component of the mixture exits as a gas
at the top of the column. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into
the condenser, which cools it down until it liquefies. The separation is more
pure with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow,
etc.) Initially, the condensate will be close to the azeotropic composition,
but when much of the ethanol has been drawn off, the condensate becomes
gradually richer in water.[citation_needed] The process continues until all the
ethanol boils out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the sharp
rise in temperature shown on the thermometer.
The above explanation reflects the theoretical way fractionation works. Normal
laboratory fractionation columns will be simple glass tubes (often vacuum-
jacketed, and sometimes internally silvered) filled with a packing, often small
glass helices of 4 to 7 millimetres (0.16 to 0.28 in) diameter. Such a column
can be calibrated by the distillation of a known mixture system to quantify the
column in terms of number of theoretical trays. To improve fractionation the
apparatus is set up to return condensate to the column by the use of some sort
of reflux splitter (reflux wire, gago, Magnetic swinging bucket, etc.) - a
typical careful fractionation would employ a reflux ratio of around 4:1 (4
parts returned condensate to 1 part condensate take off).
In laboratory distillation, several types of condensers are commonly found. The
Liebig_condenser is simply a straight tube within a water_jacket, and is the
simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham
condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the Allihn_condenser has
a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing
the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense.
Alternate set-ups may use a multiâoutlet distillation receiver flask
(referred to as a "cow" or "pig") to connect three or four receiving flasks to
the condenser. By turning the cow or pig, the distillates can be channeled into
any chosen receiver. Because the receiver does not have to be removed and
replaced during the distillation process, this type of apparatus is useful when
distilling under an inert atmosphere for air-sensitive chemicals or at reduced
pressure. A Perkin_triangle is an alternative apparatus often used in these
situations because it allows isolation of the receiver from the rest of the
system, but does require removing and reattaching a single receiver for each
fraction.
Vacuum_distillation systems operate at reduced pressure, thereby lowering the
boiling points of the materials. Anti-bumping_granules, however, become
ineffective at reduced pressures.
***** Industrial distillation[edit] *****
Typical industrial fractional distillation columns
Fractional distillation is the most common form of separation technology used
in petroleum_refineries, petrochemical and chemical_plants, natural_gas
processing and cryogenic_air_separation plants.[2][3] In most cases, the
distillation is operated at a continuous steady_state. New feed is always being
added to the distillation column and products are always being removed. Unless
the process is disturbed due to changes in feed, heat, ambient temperature, or
condensing, the amount of feed being added and the amount of product being
removed are normally equal. This is known as continuous, steady-state
fractional distillation.
Industrial distillation is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical
columns known as "distillation or fractionation towers" or "distillation
columns" with diameters ranging from about 0.65 to 6 meters (2 to 20 ft) and
heights ranging from about 6 to 60 meters (20 to 197 ft) or more. The
distillation towers have liquid outlets at intervals up the column which allow
for the withdrawal of different fractions or products having different boiling
points or boiling ranges. By increasing the temperature of the product inside
the columns, the different products are separated. The "lightest" products
(those with the lowest boiling point) exit from the top of the columns and the
"heaviest" products (those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom
of the column.
For example, fractional distillation is used in oil_refineries to separate
crude_oil into useful substances (or fractions) having different hydrocarbons
of different boiling points. The crude oil fractions with higher boiling
points:
    * have more carbon_atoms
    * have higher molecular_weights
    * are less branched chain alkanes
    * are darker in color
    * are more viscous
    * are more difficult to ignite and to burn
Diagram of a typical industrial distillation tower
Large-scale industrial towers use reflux to achieve a more complete separation
of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid
product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to the
upper part of the tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-
scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the reflux liquid
flowing downwards provides the cooling needed to condense the vapors flowing
upwards, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the distillation tower. The
more reflux is provided for a given number of theoretical_plates, the better
the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling
materials. Alternatively, the more reflux provided for a given desired
separation, the fewer theoretical plates are required.
Crude_oil is separated into fractions by fractional distillation. The fractions
at the top of the fractionating_column have lower boiling_points than the
fractions at the bottom. All of the fractions are processed further in other
refining units.
Fractional distillation is also used in air separation, producing liquid
oxygen, liquid_nitrogen, and highly concentrated argon. Distillation of
chlorosilanes also enable the production of high-purity silicon for use as a
semiconductor.
In industrial uses, sometimes a packing material is used in the column instead
of trays, especially when low pressure drops across the column are required, as
when operating under vacuum. This packing material can either be random dumped
packing (1â3 in (25â76 mm) wide) such as Raschig_rings or structured_sheet
metal. Typical manufacturers are Koch, Sulzer and other companies. Liquids tend
to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted
surface, where mass_transfer takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation
in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor_liquid_equilibrium the
vapor liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when
modeling packed columns it is useful to compute a number of "theoretical
plates" to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect
to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface
areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing
performance.
**** Design of industrial distillation columns[edit] ****
Chemical engineering schematic of typical bubble-cap trays in a distillation
tower
Design and operation of a distillation column depends on the feed and desired
products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the
McCabeâThiele_method[3][4][5] or the Fenske_equation[3] can be used. For a
multi-component feed, simulation models are used both for design and operation.
Moreover, the efficiencies of the vaporâliquid contact devices (referred to
as plates or trays) used in distillation columns are typically lower than that
of a theoretical 100% efficient equilibrium_stage. Hence, a distillation column
needs more plates than the number of theoretical vaporâliquid equilibrium
stages.
Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead product that is returned
to the tower. The reflux flowing downwards provides the cooling required for
condensing the vapours flowing upwards. The reflux ratio, which is the ratio of
the (internal) reflux to the overhead product, is conversely related to the
theoretical number of stages required for efficient separation of the
distillation products. Fractional distillation towers or columns are designed
to achieve the required separation efficiently. The design of fractionation
columns is normally made in two steps; a process design, followed by a
mechanical design. The purpose of the process design is to calculate the number
of required theoretical stages and stream flows including the reflux ratio,
heat reflux and other heat duties. The purpose of the mechanical design, on the
other hand, is to select the tower internals, column diameter and height. In
most cases, the mechanical design of fractionation towers is not
straightforward. For the efficient selection of tower internals and the
accurate calculation of column height and diameter, many factors must be taken
into account. Some of the factors involved in design calculations include feed
load size and properties and the type of distillation column used.
The two major types of distillation columns used are tray and packing columns.
Packing columns are normally used for smaller towers and loads that are
corrosive or temperature sensitive or for vacuum service where pressure drop is
important. Tray columns, on the other hand, are used for larger columns with
high liquid loads. They first appeared on the scene in the 1820s. In most oil
refinery operations, tray columns are mainly used for the separation of
petroleum fractions at different stages of oil refining.
In the oil refining industry, the design and operation of fractionation towers
is still largely accomplished on an empirical basis. The calculations involved
in the design of petroleum fractionation columns require in the usual practice
the use of numerable charts, tables and complex empirical equations. In recent
years, however, a considerable amount of work has been done to develop
efficient and reliable computer-aided design procedures for fractional
distillation.[6]
