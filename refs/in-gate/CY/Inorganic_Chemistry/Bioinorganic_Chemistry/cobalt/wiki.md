Cobalt is a chemical_element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27. Like
nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form,
save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric_iron. The free
element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray
metal.
Cobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt_blue) have been used since ancient times for
jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the
color was later thought by alchemists [citation needed] to be due to the known
metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore)
for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because
they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes
when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the
first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the
kobold.
Today, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-
lustered ores, such as cobaltite (CoAsS). The element is however more usually
produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. The_copper_belt in the
Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo (DRC) and Zambia yields most of the global
cobalt production. The DRC alone accounted for more than 50% of world
production in 2016 (123,000 tonnes), according to Natural_Resources_Canada.[4]
Cobalt is primarily used in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and
high-strength alloys. The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II)_aluminate
(CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics,
inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope,
cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a
radioactive_tracer and for the production of high energy gamma_rays.
Cobalt is the active center of a group of coenzymes called cobalamins. Vitamin
B12, the best-known example of the type, is an essential vitamin for all
animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also a micronutrient for bacteria, algae,
and fungi.

***** Characteristics *****
[a_sample_of_pure_cobolt]
A block of electrolytically refined cobalt (99.9% purity) cut from a large
plate
Cobalt is a ferromagnetic metal with a specific_gravity of 8.9. The Curie
temperature is 1,115Â Ã‚Â°C (2,039Â Ã‚Â°F)[5] and the magnetic moment is 1.6Ã¢Â€Â“1.7
Bohr_magnetons per atom.[6] Cobalt has a relative_permeability two-thirds that
of iron.[7] Metallic cobalt occurs as two crystallographic_structures: hcp and
fcc. The ideal transition temperature between the hcp and fcc structures is
450Â Ã‚Â°C (842Â Ã‚Â°F), but in practice the energy difference between them is so
small that random intergrowth of the two is common.[8][9][10]
Cobalt is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from oxidation by a
passivating oxide film. It is attacked by halogens and sulfur. Heating in
oxygen produces Co3O4 which loses oxygen at 900Â Ã‚Â°C (1,650Â Ã‚Â°F) to give the
monoxide CoO.[11] The metal reacts with fluorine (F2) at 520Â K to give CoF3;
with chlorine (Cl2), bromine (Br2) and iodine (I2), producing equivalent binary
halides. It does not react with hydrogen_gas (H2) or nitrogen_gas (N2) even
when heated, but it does react with boron, carbon, phosphorus, arsenic and
sulfur.[12] At ordinary temperatures, it reacts slowly with mineral_acids, and
very slowly with moist, but not with dry, air.
***** Compounds *****
See also: Category:Cobalt_compounds.
Common oxidation_states of cobalt include +2 and +3, although compounds with
oxidation states ranging from Ã¢ÂˆÂ’3 to +5 are also known. A common oxidation
state for simple compounds is +2 (cobalt(II)). These salts form the pink-
colored metal_aquo_complex [Co(H2O)6]2+ in water. Addition of chloride gives
the intensely blue [CoCl
4]2Ã¢ÂˆÂ’
.[3] In a borax bead flame_test, cobalt shows deep blue in both oxidizing and
reducing flames.[13]
**** Oxygen and chalcogen compounds ****
Several oxides of cobalt are known. Green cobalt(II)_oxide (CoO) has rocksalt
structure. It is readily oxidized with water and oxygen to brown cobalt(III)
hydroxide (Co(OH)3). At temperatures of 600Ã¢Â€Â“700Â Ã‚Â°C, CoO oxidizes to the blue
cobalt(II,III)_oxide (Co3O4), which has a spinel structure.[3] Black cobalt
(III)_oxide (Co2O3) is also known.[14] Cobalt oxides are antiferromagnetic at
low temperature: CoO (NÃƒÂ©el_temperature 291Â K) and Co3O4 (NÃƒÂ©el temperature:
40Â K), which is analogous to magnetite (Fe3O4), with a mixture of +2 and +3
oxidation states.[15]
The principal chalcogenides of cobalt include the black cobalt(II)_sulfides,
CoS2, which adopts a pyrite-like structure, and cobalt(III)_sulfide (Co2S3).
**** Halides ****
[purple_pile_of_power_of_Cobalt(II)-chloride-hexahydrate]
Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate
Four dihalides of cobalt(II) are known: cobalt(II)_fluoride (CoF2, pink),
cobalt(II)_chloride (CoCl2, blue), cobalt(II)_bromide (CoBr2, green), cobalt
(II)_iodide (CoI2, blue-black). These halides exist in anhydrous and hydrated
forms. Whereas the anhydrous dichloride is blue, the hydrate is red.[16]
The reduction potential for the reaction Co3+
 + eÃ¢ÂˆÂ’ Ã¢Â†Â’ Co2+
 is +1.92Â V, beyond that for chlorine to chloride, +1.36Â V. Consequently,
cobalt(III) and chloride would result in the cobalt(III) being reduced to
cobalt(II). Because the reduction potential for fluorine to fluoride is so
high, +2.87Â V, cobalt(III)_fluoride is one of the few simple stable cobalt(III)
compounds. Cobalt(III) fluoride, which is used in some fluorination reactions,
reacts vigorously with water.[11]
**** Coordination compounds ****
As for all metals, molecular compounds and polyatomic ions of cobalt are
classified as coordination_complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain
cobalt linked to several ligands. The principles of electronegativity and
hardnessÃ¢Â€Â“softness of a series of ligands can be used to explain the usual
oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co+3 complexes tend to have ammine
ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to
feature the softer Co2+ and Co+, an example being tris
(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C6H5)3)3CoCl). The more
electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co4+ and Co5+
derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs2CoF6) and potassium
percobaltate (K3CoO4).[11]
Alfred_Werner, a Nobel-prize winning pioneer in coordination_chemistry, worked
with compounds of empirical_formula [Co(NH3)6]3+. One of the isomers determined
was cobalt(III)_hexammine_chloride. This coordination complex, a typical
Werner-type complex, consists of a central cobalt atom coordinated by six
ammine orthogonal ligands and three chloride counteranions. Using chelating
ethylenediamine ligands in place of ammonia gives tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt
(III) ([Co(en)3]3+), which was one of the first coordination_complexes to be
resolved into optical_isomers. The complex exists in the right- and left-handed
forms of a "three-bladed propeller". This complex was first isolated by Werner
as yellow-gold needle-like crystals.[17][18]
**** Organometallic compounds ****
Structure of tetrakis(1-norbornyl)cobalt(IV)
Main article: Organocobalt_chemistry
Cobaltocene is a structural_analog to ferrocene, with cobalt in place of iron.
Cobaltocene is much more sensitive to oxidation than ferrocene.[19] Cobalt
carbonyl (Co2(CO)8) is a catalyst in carbonylation and hydrosilylation
reactions.[20] Vitamin B12 (see below) is an organometallic compound found in
nature and is the only vitamin that contains a metal atom.[21] An example of an
alkylcobalt complex in the otherwise uncommon +4 oxidation state of cobalt is
the homoleptic complex tetrakis(1-norbornyl)cobalt(IV)Â [de] (Co(1-norb)4), a
transition metal-alkyl complex that is notable for its stability to ÃÂ²-hydrogen
elimination.[22] The cobalt(III) and cobalt(V) complexes [Li(THF)4]+[Co(1-
norb)4]Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ and [Co(1-norb)4]+[BF4]Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ are also known.[23]
***** Isotopes *****
Main article: Isotopes_of_cobalt
59Co is the only stable cobalt isotope and the only isotope that exists
naturally on Earth. Twenty-two radioisotopes have been characterized; the most
stable, 60Co has a half-life of 5.2714Â years, and 57Co has a half-life of
271.8Â days, 56Co a half-life of 77.27Â days, and 58Co a half-life of 70.86Â days.
All the other radioactive isotopes of cobalt have half-lives shorter than
18Â hours, and in most cases shorter than 1Â second. This element also has 4 meta
states, all of which have half-lives shorter than 15 minutes.[24]
The isotopes of cobalt range in atomic_weight from 50 u (50Co) to 73 u (73Co).
The primary decay_mode for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that
of the most abundant stable isotope, 59Co, is electron_capture and the primary
mode of decay in isotopes with atomic mass greater than 59 atomic mass units is
beta_decay. The primary decay_products below 59Co are element 26 (iron)
isotopes; above that the decay products are element 28 (nickel) isotopes.[24]
***** History *****
[cobalt_blue_Chinese_porcelain]
Early Chinese blue and white porcelain, manufactured c. 1335
Cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to
glass, glazes, and ceramics. Cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculpture,
Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins of Pompeii,
destroyed in 79 AD, and in China, dating from the Tang_dynasty (618Ã¢Â€Â“907 AD)
and the Ming_dynasty (1368Ã¢Â€Â“1644 AD).[25]
Cobalt has been used to color glass since the Bronze_Age. The excavation of the
Uluburun_shipwreck yielded an ingot of blue glass, cast during the 14th century
BC.[26][27] Blue glass from Egypt was either colored with copper, iron, or
cobalt. The oldest cobalt-colored glass is from the eighteenth_dynasty_of_Egypt
(1550Ã¢Â€Â“1292 BC). The source for the cobalt the Egyptians used is not known.
[28][29]
The word cobalt is derived from the German kobalt, from kobold meaning
"goblin", a superstitious term used for the ore of cobalt by miners. The first
attempts to smelt those ores for copper or nickel failed, yielding simply
powder (cobalt(II) oxide) instead. Because the primary ores of cobalt always
contain arsenic, smelting the ore oxidized the arsenic into the highly toxic
and volatile arsenic_oxide, adding to the notoriety of the ore.[30]
Swedish chemist Georg_Brandt (1694Ã¢Â€Â“1768) is credited with discovering cobalt
circa 1735, showing it to be a previously unknown element, different from
bismuth and other traditional metals. Brandt called it a new "semi-metal".[31]
[32] He showed that compounds of cobalt metal were the source of the blue color
in glass, which previously had been attributed to the bismuth found with
cobalt. Cobalt became the first metal to be discovered since the pre-historical
period. All other known metals (iron, copper, silver, gold, zinc, mercury, tin,
lead and bismuth) had no recorded discoverers.[33]
During the 19th century, a significant part of the world's production of cobalt
blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt_glass
powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out
at the Norwegian BlaafarvevÃƒÂ¦rket.[34][35] The first mines for the production
of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and
Hungary. With the discovery of cobalt ore in New_Caledonia in 1864, the mining
of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario,
Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga
Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again.[30] When
the Shaba_conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly
stopped production.[36][37] The impact on the world cobalt economy from this
conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is
highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for
recycling cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to
cobalt-free alternatives.[36][37]
In 1938, John Livingood and Glenn_T._Seaborg discovered the radioisotope
cobalt-60.[38] This isotope was famously used at Columbia_University in the
1950s to establish parity violation in radioactive beta_decay.[39][40]
After World War II, the US wanted to guarantee the supply of cobalt ore for
military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within
the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near
Blackbird_canyon in the side of a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company
started production at the site.[41]
It has been argued that cobalt will be one of the main objects of geopolitical
competition in a world running on renewable energy and dependent on batteries,
but this perspective has also been criticised for underestimating the power of
economic incentives for expanded production.[42]
***** Occurrence *****
The stable form of cobalt is produced in supernovas through the r-process.[43]
It comprises 0.0029%_of_the_Earth's_crust. Free cobalt (the native_metal) is
not found on Earth because of the oxygen in the atmosphere and the chlorine in
the ocean. Both are abundant enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to
prevent native metal cobalt from forming. Except as recently delivered in
meteoric iron, pure cobalt in native metal form is unknown on Earth. The
element has a medium abundance but natural compounds of cobalt are numerous and
small amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soils, plants, and
animals.
In nature, cobalt is frequently associated with nickel. Both are characteristic
components of meteoric_iron, though cobalt is much less abundant in iron
meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have
been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but
alloyed) metal,[44] though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient
terrestrial crust.
Cobalt in compound form occurs in copper and nickel minerals. It is the major
metallic component that combines with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic
cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs2), glaucodot ((Co,Fe)AsS), and skutterudite
(CoAs3) minerals.[11] The mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs
together with vaesite in the copper deposits of Katanga_Province.[45] When it
reaches the atmosphere, weathering occurs; the sulfide minerals oxidize and
form pink erythrite ("cobalt glance": Co3(AsO4)2Ã‚Â·8H2O) and spherocobaltite
(CoCO3).[46][47]
Cobalt is also a constituent of tobacco_smoke.[48] The tobacco_plant readily
absorbs and accumulates heavy_metals like cobalt from the surrounding soil in
its leaves. These are subsequently inhaled during tobacco_smoking.[49]

The main ores of cobalt are cobaltite, erythrite, glaucodot and skutterudite
(see above), but most cobalt is obtained by reducing the cobalt by-products of
nickel and copper mining and smelting.[51][52]
Since cobalt is generally produced as a by-product, the supply of cobalt
depends to a great extent on the economic feasibility of copper and nickel
mining in a given market. Demand for cobalt was projected to grow 6% in 2017.
[53]
Several methods exist to separate cobalt from copper and nickel, depending on
the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One
method is froth_flotation, in which surfactants bind to different ore
components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent roasting
converts the ores to cobalt_sulfate, and the copper and the iron are oxidized
to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the
arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric_acid, yielding a
solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper
smelting.[54]
The products of the above-mentioned processes are transformed into the cobalt
oxide (Co3O4). This oxide is reduced to metal by the aluminothermic_reaction or
reduction with carbon in a blast_furnace.[11]
***** Cobalt extraction *****
The United_States_Geological_Survey estimates world reserves of cobalt at
7,100,000 metric tons.[55] The Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo (DRC) currently
produces 63% of the world's cobalt. This market share may reach 73% by 2025 if
planned expansions by mining producers like Glencore Plc take place as
expected. But by 2030, global demand could be 47 times more than it was in
2017, Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated.[56]
Changes that Congo made to mining laws in 2002 attracted new investments in
Congolese copper and cobalt projects. Glencore's Mutanda mine shipped 24,500
tons of cobalt last year, 40% of Congo DRC's output and nearly a quarter of
global production. Glencore's Katanga Mining project is resuming as well and
should produce 300,000 tons of copper and 20,000 tons of cobalt by 2019,
according to Glencore.[53]
**** Democratic Republic of the Congo ****
See also: Conflict_minerals, Child_labor, and strip_mining
In 2005, the top producer of cobalt was the copper deposits in the Democratic
Republic_of_the_Congo's Katanga_Province. Formerly Shaba province, the area had
almost 40% of global reserves, reported the British_Geological_Survey in 2009.
[57] By 2015, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) supplied 60% of world
cobalt production, 32,000 tons at $20,000 to $26,000 per ton. Recent growth in
production could at least partly be due to how low mining production fell
during DRC Congo's very violent civil wars in the early 2000s, or to the
changes the country made to its Mining Code in 2002 to encourage foreign and
multinational investment and which did bring in a number of investors,
including Glencore.
Artisanal_mining supplied 10% to 25% of the DRC production.[58] Some 100,000
cobalt miners in Congo DRC use hand tools to dig hundreds of feet, with little
planning and fewer safety measures, say workers and government and NGO
officials, as well as Washington_Post reporters' observations on visits to
isolated mines. The lack of safety precautions frequently causes injuries or
death.[59] Mining pollutes the vicinity and exposes local wildlife and
indigenous communities to toxic metals thought to cause birth defects and
breathing difficulties, according to health officials.[60]
Human rights activists have alleged, and investigative_journalism reported
confirmation,[61][62] that child_labor is used in mining cobalt from African
artisanal_mines.[58][63] This revelation prompted cell phone maker Apple_Inc.,
on March 3, 2017, to stop buying ore from suppliers such as Zhejiang_Huayou
Cobalt who source from artisanal mines in the DRC, and begin using only
suppliers that are verified to meet its workplace standards.[64][65]
The political and ethnic dynamics of the region have in the past caused
horrific outbreaks of violence and years of armed conflict and displaced
populations. This instability affected the price of cobalt and also created
perverse incentives for the combatants in the First and Second Congo Wars to
prolong the fighting, since access to diamond mines and other valuable
resources helped to finance their military goalsÃ¢Â€Â”which frequently amounted to
genocideÃ¢Â€Â”and also enriched the fighters themselves. While DR Congo has in the
2010s not recently been invaded by neighboring military forces, some of the
richest mineral deposits adjoin areas where Tutsis and Hutus still frequently
clash, unrest continues although on a smaller scale and refugees still flee
outbreaks of violence.[66]
Cobalt extracted from small Congolese artisanal_mining endeavors in 2007
supplied a single Chinese company, Congo DongFang International Mining. A
subsidiary of Zhejiang_Huayou_Cobalt, one of the world's largest cobalt
producers, Congo DongFang supplied cobalt to some of the world's largest
battery manufacturers, who produced batteries for ubiquitous products like the
Apple iPhones. Corporate pieties about an ethical supply_chain were thus met
with some incredulity. A number of observers have called for tech corporations
and other manufacturers to avoid sourcing conflict metals in Central Africa at
all rather than risk enabling the financial exploitation, human_rights abuses
like kidnappings for unfree_labor, environmental devastation and the human toll
of violence, poverty and toxic conditions.
The Mukondo_Mountain project, operated by the Central_African_Mining_and
Exploration_Company (CAMEC) in Katanga_Province, may be the richest cobalt
reserve in the world. It produced an estimated one third of the total global
cobalt production in 2008.[67] In July 2009, CAMEC announced a long-term
agreement to deliver its entire annual production of cobalt concentrate from
Mukondo Mountain to Zhejiang Galico Cobalt & Nickel Materials of China.[68]
In February 2018, global asset management firm AllianceBernstein defined the
DRC as economically "the Saudi_Arabia of the electric vehicle age," due to its
cobalt resources, as essential to the lithium-ion_batteries that drive electric
vehicles.[69]
On March 9, 2018, President Joseph_Kabila updated the 2002 mining code,
increasing royalty charges and declaring cobalt and coltan "strategic metals".
[70][71]
**** Canada ****
In 2017, some exploration companies were planning to survey old silver and
cobalt mines in the area of Cobalt,_Ontario where significant deposits are
believed to lie.[72] The mayor of Cobalt stated that the people of Cobalt
welcomed new mining endeavours and pointed out that the local work force is
peaceful and English-speaking, and good infrastructure would allow much easier
sourcing of spare parts for the equipment or other supplies than were to be
found in conflict-zones.
***** Applications *****
Cobalt has been used in the production of high-performance alloys.[51][52] It
can also be used to make rechargeable batteries, and the advent of electric
vehicles and their success with consumers probably has a great deal to do with
the DRC's soaring production. Other important factors were the 2002 Mining
Code, which encouraged investment by foreign and transnational corporations
such as Glencore, and the end of the First and Second Congo Wars.
**** Alloys ****
Cobalt-based superalloys have historically consumed most of the cobalt
produced.[51][52] The temperature stability of these alloys makes them suitable
for turbine blades for gas_turbines and aircraft jet_engines, although nickel-
based single-crystal alloys surpass them in performance.[73] Cobalt-based
alloys are also corrosion- and wear-resistant, making them, like titanium,
useful for making orthopedic implants that don't wear down over time. The
development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started in the first decade of the
20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying
quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten_carbides
are very hard and wear-resistant.[74] Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys
like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements).[75]
Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for
nickel, which may be allergenic.[76] Some high-speed_steels also contain cobalt
for increased heat and wear resistance. The special alloys of aluminium,
nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-
cobalt_magnet) are used in permanent_magnets.[77] It is also alloyed with 95%
platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting, which is
also slightly magnetic.[78]
**** Batteries ****
Lithium_cobalt_oxide (LiCoO2) is widely used in lithium-ion_battery cathodes.
The material is composed of cobalt oxide layers with the lithium intercalated.
During discharge,[clarification_needed] the lithium is released as lithium
ions.[79] Nickel-cadmium[80] (NiCd) and nickel_metal_hydride[81] (NiMH)
batteries also include cobalt to improve the oxidation of nickel in the
battery.[80] Transparency Market Research estimated the global lithium-ion
battery market at $30 billion in 2015 and predicted an increase to over US$75
billion by 2024.[82]
Although in 2018 most cobalt in batteries was used in a mobile device,[83] a
more recent application for cobalt is rechargeable batteries for electric cars.
This industry has increased five-fold in its demand for cobalt, which makes it
urgent to find new raw materials in more stable areas of the world.[84] Demand
is expected to continue or increase as the prevalence of electric vehicles
increases.[85] Exploration in 2016Ã¢Â€Â“2017 included the area around Cobalt,
Ontario, an area where many silver mines ceased operation decades ago.[84]
Since child and slave labor have been repeatedly reported in cobalt mining,
primarily in the artisanal mines of DR Congo, tech companies seeking an ethical
supply chain have faced shortages of this raw material and[86] the price of
cobalt metal reached a nine-year high in October 2017, more than US$30 a pound,
versus US$10 in late 2015.[87]
**** Catalysts ****
Several cobalt compounds are oxidation catalysts. Cobalt acetate is used to
convert xylene to terephthalic_acid, the precursor of the bulk polymer
polyethylene_terephthalate. Typical catalysts are the cobalt carboxylates
(known as cobalt soaps). They are also used in paints, varnishes, and inks as
"drying agents" through the oxidation of drying_oils.[79] The same carboxylates
are used to improve the adhesion between steel and rubber in steel-belted
radial tires. In addition they are used as accelerators in polyester_resin
systems.
Cobalt-based catalysts are used in reactions involving carbon_monoxide. Cobalt
is also a catalyst in the FischerÃ¢Â€Â“Tropsch_process for the hydrogenation of
carbon monoxide into liquid fuels.[88] Hydroformylation of alkenes often uses
cobalt_octacarbonyl as a catalyst,[89] although it is often replaced by more
efficient iridium- and rhodium-based catalysts, e.g. the Cativa_process.
The hydrodesulfurization of petroleum uses a catalyst derived from cobalt and
molybdenum. This process helps to clean petroleum of sulfur impurities that
interfere with the refining of liquid fuels.[79]
**** Pigments and coloring ****
[shelf_with_blue_glass_vessels]
Cobalt blue glass
[blue_glass_bottle_with_neck]
Cobalt-colored glass
Before the 19th century, cobalt was predominantly used as a pigment. It has
been used since the Middle Ages to make smalt, a blue-colored glass. Smalt is
produced by melting a mixture of roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium
carbonate, which yields a dark blue silicate glass, which is finely ground
after the production.[90] Smalt was widely used to color glass and as pigment
for paintings.[91] In 1780, Sven_Rinman discovered cobalt_green, and in 1802
Louis_Jacques_ThÃƒÂ©nard discovered cobalt blue.[92] Cobalt pigments such as
cobalt_blue (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various
hues of cobalt_green (a mixture of cobalt(II)_oxide and zinc_oxide), and cobalt
violet (cobalt_phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their
superior chromatic stability.[93][94] Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is now largely
replaced by more lightfast[clarification_needed] yellow pigments.
**** Radioisotopes ****
Cobalt-60 (Co-60 or 60Co) is useful as a gamma-ray source because they can be
produced in predictable quantity and high activity by bombarding cobalt with
neutrons. It produces gamma_rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33Â MeV.[24][95]
Cobalt is used in external_beam_radiotherapy, sterilization of medical supplies
and medical waste, radiation treatment of foods_for_sterilization (cold
pasteurization),[96] industrial_radiography (e.g. weld integrity radiographs),
density measurements (e.g. concrete density measurements), and tank fill height
switches. The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust,
causing problems with radiation_protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines
has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, and one of the worst
radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a
discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in
a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.[97][98]
Cobalt-60 has a radioactive half-life of 5.27Â years. Loss of potency requires
periodic replacement of the source in radiotherapy and is one reason why cobalt
machines have been largely replaced by linear_accelerators in modern radiation
therapy.[99] Cobalt-57 (Co-57 or 57Co) is a cobalt radioisotope most often used
in medical tests, as a radiolabel for vitamin B12 uptake, and for the Schilling
test. Cobalt-57 is used as a source in MÃƒÂ¶ssbauer_spectroscopy and is one of
several possible sources in X-ray_fluorescence devices.[100][101]
Nuclear_weapon_designs could intentionally incorporate 59Co, some of which
would be activated in a nuclear_explosion to produce 60Co. The 60Co, dispersed
as nuclear_fallout, is sometimes called a cobalt_bomb.[102]
**** Other uses ****
    * Cobalt is used in electroplating for its attractive appearance, hardness,
      and resistance to oxidation;[103]
    * It is also used as a base primer coat for porcelain enamels.[104]
***** Biological role *****
[chemical_diagram_of_cobalamin_molecule]
Cobalamin
[two_cobalt-deficient_sheep_facing_away_from_camera]
Cobalt-deficient sheep
Cobalt is essential to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent
of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B12, the primary biological reservoir of
cobalt as an ultratrace_element.[105][106] Bacteria in the stomachs of ruminant
animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B12, a compound which can only be
produced by bacteria or archaea. A minimal presence of cobalt in soils
therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of
0.20Â mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin
B12.[107]
Proteins based on cobalamin use corrin to hold the cobalt. Coenzyme B12
features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions.[108] In
humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes
methyl (Ã¢ÂˆÂ’CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes
rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two
adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which
may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an
amine. Methylmalonyl_coenzyme_A_mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, an
important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.[109]
Although far less common than other metalloproteins (e.g. those of zinc and
iron), other cobaltoproteins are known besides B12. These proteins include
methionine_aminopeptidase_2, an enzyme that occurs in humans and other mammals
that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another
non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile_hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that
metabolizes nitriles.[110]
**** Cobalt deficiency in animals ****
In the early 20th century, during the development of farming on the North
Island_Volcanic_Plateau of New Zealand, cattle suffered from what was termed
"bush sickness". It was discovered that the volcanic soils lacked the cobalt
salts essential for the cattle food chain.[111][112]
The "coast disease" of sheep in the Ninety_Mile_Desert of the Southeast of
South_Australia in the 1930s was found to originate in nutritional deficiencies
of trace elements cobalt and copper. The cobalt deficiency was overcome by the
development of "cobalt bullets", dense pellets of cobalt oxide mixed with clay
given orally for lodging in the animal's rumen.[clarification_needed][113][112]

Cobalt is an essential element for life in minute amounts. The LD50 value for
soluble cobalt salts has been estimated to be between 150 and 500Â mg/kg.[115]
In the US, the Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration (OSHA) has
designated a permissible_exposure_limit (PEL) in the workplace as a time-
weighted average (TWA) of 0.1Â mg/m3. The National_Institute_for_Occupational
Safety_and_Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended_exposure_limit (REL) of
0.05Â mg/m3, time-weighted average. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and
health) value is 20Â mg/m3.[116]
However, chronic cobalt ingestion has caused serious health problems at doses
far less than the lethal dose. In 1966, the addition of cobalt compounds to
stabilize beer_foam in Canada led to a peculiar form of toxin-induced
cardiomyopathy, which came to be known as beer drinker's cardiomyopathy.[117]
[118]
It causes respiratory problems when inhaled.[119] It also causes skin problems
when touched; after nickel and chromium, cobalt is a major cause of contact
dermatitis.[120] These risks are faced by cobalt miners.
Cobalt can be effectively absorbed by charred pigs' bones; however, this
process is inhibited by copper and zinc, which have greater affinities to bone
char.[121]
