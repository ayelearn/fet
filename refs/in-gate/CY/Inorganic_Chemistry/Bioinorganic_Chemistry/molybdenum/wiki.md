Molybdenum is a chemical_element with the symbol Mo and atomic_number 42. The
name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient_Greek ÃÂœÃÂŒÃÂ»ÃÂ…ÃÂ²ÃÂ´ÃÂ¿ÃÂ‚
molybdos, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores.[7]
Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was
discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral
salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele. The metal was first
isolated in 1781 by Peter_Jacob_Hjelm.[8]
Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free_metal on Earth; it is found only
in various oxidation_states in minerals. The free element, a silvery metal with
a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting_point of any element. It readily
forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of world
production of the element (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-
strength alloys and superalloys.
Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but when molybdenum-
bearing minerals contact oxygen and water, the resulting molybdate ion MoO2Ã¢ÂˆÂ’
4 is quite soluble. Industrially, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world
production of the element) are used in high-pressure and high-temperature
applications as pigments and catalysts.
Molybdenum-bearing_enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for
breaking the chemical_bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen in the process of
biological nitrogen_fixation. At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in
bacteria, plants, and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial
enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation. These nitrogenases contain
molybdenum in a form different from other molybdenum enzymes, which all contain
fully oxidized molybdenum in a molybdenum_cofactor. These various molybdenum
cofactor enzymes are vital to the organisms, and molybdenum is an essential
element for life in all higher eukaryote organisms, though not in all bacteria.

***** Characteristics[edit] *****
**** Physical properties[edit] ****
In its pure form, molybdenum is a silvery-grey metal with a Mohs_hardness of
5.5, and a standard atomic weight of 95.95Â g/mol.[9][10] It has a melting_point
of 2,623Â Ã‚Â°C (4,753Â Ã‚Â°F); of the naturally occurring elements, only tantalum,
osmium, rhenium, tungsten, and carbon have higher melting points.[7] It has one
of the lowest coefficients of thermal_expansion among commercially used metals.
[11] The tensile_strength of molybdenum wires increases about 3 times, from
about 10 to 30Â GPa, when their diameter decreases from ~50Ã¢Â€Â“100Â nm to 10Â nm.
[12]
**** Chemical properties[edit] ****
Molybdenum is a transition_metal with an electronegativity of 2.16 on the
Pauling scale. It does not visibly react with oxygen or water at room
temperature. Weak oxidation of molybdenum starts at 300Â Ã‚Â°C (572Â Ã‚Â°F); bulk
oxidation occurs at temperatures above 600Â Ã‚Â°C, resulting in molybdenum
trioxide. Like many heavier transition metals, molybdenum shows little
inclination to form a cation in aqueous solution, although the Mo3+ cation is
known under carefully controlled conditions.[13]
**** Isotopes[edit] ****
Main article: Isotopes_of_molybdenum
There are 35 known isotopes of molybdenum, ranging in atomic_mass from 83 to
117, as well as four metastable nuclear_isomers. Seven isotopes occur
naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these
naturally occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable.[14]
Molybdenum-98 is the most abundant isotope, comprising 24.14% of all
molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019Â y and undergoes double
beta_decay into ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111
to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150Â ns.[14][15] All unstable
isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and
ruthenium.[15]
As also noted below, the most common isotopic molybdenum application involves
molybdenum-99, which is a fission product. It is a parent radioisotope to the
short-lived gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear
isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine.[16] In 2008, the Delft
University_of_Technology applied for a patent on the molybdenum-98-based
production of molybdenum-99.[17]
***** Compounds[edit] *****

Molybdenum forms chemical compounds in oxidation states from -II to +VI. Higher
oxidation states are more relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its
biological roles, mid-level oxidation states are often associated with metal
clusters, and very low oxidation states are typically associated with
organomolybdenum_compounds. Mo and W chemistry shows strong similarities. The
relative rarity of molybdenum(III), for example, contrasts with the
pervasiveness of the chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is
seen in molybdenum(VI)_oxide (MoO3), whereas the normal sulfur compound is
molybdenum_disulfide MoS2.[18]

From the perspective of commerce, the most important compounds are molybdenum
disulfide (MoS
2) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO
3). The black disulfide is the main mineral. It is roasted in air to give the
trioxide:[18]
      2 MoS
      2 + 7 O
      2 Ã¢Â†Â’ 2 MoO
      3 + 4 SO

The trioxide, which is volatile at high temperatures, is the precursor to
virtually all other Mo compounds as well as alloys. Molybdenum has several
oxidation_states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at
left).
Molybdenum(VI) oxide is soluble in strong alkaline water, forming molybdates
(MoO42Ã¢ÂˆÂ’). Molybdates are weaker oxidants than chromates. They tend to form
structurally complex oxyanions by condensation at lower pH values, such as
[Mo7O24]6Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ and [Mo8O26]4Ã¢ÂˆÂ’. Polymolybdates can incorporate other ions,
forming polyoxometalates.[20] The dark-blue phosphorus-containing
heteropolymolybdate P[Mo12O40]3Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ is used for the spectroscopic detection of
phosphorus.[21] The broad range of oxidation_states of molybdenum is reflected
in various molybdenum chlorides:[18]
    * Molybdenum(II)_chloride MoCl2, which exists as the hexamer Mo6Cl12 and
      the related dianion [Mo6Cl14]2-.
    * Molybdenum(III)_chloride MoCl3, a dark red solid, which converts to the
      anion trianionic complex [MoCl6]3-.
    * Molybdenum(IV)_chloride MoCl4, a black solid, which adopts a polymeric
      structure.
    * Molybdenum(V)_chloride MoCl5 dark green solid that adopts a dimeric
      structure.
Molybdenum(VI) chloride MoCl6 is not known, although the molybdenum
hexafluoride is well characterized.
Like chromium and some other transition metals, molybdenum forms quadruple
bonds, such as in Mo2(CH3COO)4 and [Mo2Cl8]4Ã¢ÂˆÂ’, which also has a quadruple
bond.[18][22]
The oxidation state 0 is possible with carbon monoxide as ligand, such as in
molybdenum_hexacarbonyl, Mo(CO)6.[18]
***** History[edit] *****
MolybdeniteÃ¢Â€Â”the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extractedÃ¢Â€Â”was
previously known as molybdena. Molybdena was confused with and often utilized
as though it were graphite. Like graphite, molybdenite can be used to blacken a
surface or as a solid lubricant.[23] Even when molybdena was distinguishable
from graphite, it was still confused with the common lead ore PbS (now called
galena); the name comes from Ancient_Greek ÃÂœÃÂŒÃÂ»ÃÂ…ÃÂ²ÃÂ´ÃÂ¿ÃÂ‚ molybdos, meaning
lead.[11] (The Greek word itself has been proposed as a loanword from Anatolian
Luvian and Lydian languages).[24]
Although (reportedly) molybdenum was deliberately alloyed with steel in one
14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely
and was later lost.[25][26] In the West in 1754, Bengt_Andersson_Qvist examined
a sample of molybdenite and determined that it did not contain lead and thus
was not galena.[27]
By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was
(indeed) neither galena nor graphite.[28][29] Instead, Scheele correctly
proposed that molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element, named molybdenum
for the mineral in which it resided, and from which it might be isolated. Peter
Jacob_Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed_oil in
1781.[11][30]
For the next century, molybdenum had no industrial use. It was relatively
scarce, the pure metal was difficult to extract, and the necessary techniques
of metallurgy were immature.[31][32][33] Early molybdenum steel alloys showed
great promise of increased hardness, but efforts to manufacture the alloys on a
large scale were hampered with inconsistent results, a tendency toward
brittleness, and recrystallization. In 1906, William_D._Coolidge filed a patent
for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to applications as a heating element
for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light
bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically
sealed or held in an inert gas.[34] In 1913, Frank_E._Elmore developed a froth
flotation_process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the
primary isolation process.[35]
During World_War_I, demand for molybdenum spiked; it was used both in armor
plating and as a substitute for tungsten in high_speed_steels. Some British
tanks were protected by 75Â mm (3Â in) manganese_steel plating, but this proved
to be ineffective. The manganese steel plates were replaced with much lighter
25Â mm (1.0Â in) molybdenum steel plates allowing for higher speed, greater
maneuverability, and better protection.[11] The Germans also used molybdenum-
doped steel for heavy artillery, like in the super-heavy howitzer Big_Bertha,
[36] because traditional steel melts at the temperatures produced by the
propellant of the one_ton shell.[37] After the war, demand plummeted until
metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications.
In World_War_II, molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for
tungsten in steel alloys.[38]

Molybdenum is the 54th_most_abundant_element_in_the_Earth's_crust with an
average of 1.5 parts per million and the 25th most abundant element in its
oceans, with an average of 10Â parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant
element in the Universe.[11][39] The Russian Luna_24 mission discovered a
molybdenum-bearing grain (1 ÃƒÂ— 0.6Â Ã‚Âµm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare
Crisium on the Moon.[40] The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's
crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often
combined with sulfur in the same way as copper, with which it is often found.
Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite
(CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined
as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten
mining.[7]
The world's production of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest
producers being China (94,000Â t), the United States (64,000Â t), Chile
(38,000Â t), Peru (18,000Â t) and Mexico (12,000Â t). The total reserves are
estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3Â Mt),
the US (2.7Â Mt) and Chile (1.2Â Mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum
production is about evenly shared between North America, South America (mainly
in Chile), and China. Europe and the rest of Asia (mostly Armenia, Russia, Iran
and Mongolia) produce the remainder.[41]
World production trend
In molybdenite processing, the ore is first roasted in air at a temperature of
700Â Ã‚Â°C (1,292Â Ã‚Â°F). The process gives gaseous sulfur dioxide and the
molybdenum(VI)_oxide:[18]
      2 MoS2 + 7 O2 Ã¢Â†Â’ 2 MoO3 + 4 SO2
The oxidized ore is then usually extracted with aqueous ammonia to give
ammonium molybdate:
      MoO3 + 2 NH3 + H2O Ã¢Â†Â’ (NH4)2(MoO4)
Copper, an impurity in molybdenite, is less soluble in ammonia. To completely
remove it from the solution, it is precipitated with hydrogen_sulfide.[18]
Ammonium molybdate converts to ammonium_dimolybdate, which is isolated as a
solid. Heating this solid gives molybdenum trioxide:[42]
      (NH4)2Mo2O7 Ã¢Â†Â’ 2 MoO3 + 2 NH3 + H2O
Crude trioxide can be further purified by sublimation at 1,100Â Ã‚Â°C (2,010Â Ã‚Â°F).
Metallic molybdenum is produced by reduction of the oxide with hydrogen:
      MoO3 + 3 H2 Ã¢Â†Â’ Mo + 3 H2O
The molybdenum for steel production is reduced by the aluminothermic_reaction
with addition of iron to produce ferromolybdenum. A common form of
ferromolybdenum contains 60% molybdenum.[18][43]
Molybdenum had a value of approximately $30,000 per tonne as of August 2009. It
maintained a price at or near $10,000 per tonne from 1997 through 2003, and
reached a peak of $103,000 per tonne in June 2005.[44] In 2008, the London
Metal_Exchange announced that molybdenum would be traded as a commodity.[45]
**** History of molybdenum mining[edit] ****
Historically, the Knaben mine in southern Norway, opened in 1885, was the first
dedicated molybdenum mine. It was closed in 1973 but was reopened in 2007.[46]
and now produces 100,000 kilograms (98 long tons; 110 short tons) of molybdenum
disulfide per year. Large mines in Colorado (such as the Henderson_mine and the
Climax_mine)[47] and in British Columbia yield molybdenite as their primary
product, while many porphyry_copper deposits such as the Bingham_Canyon_Mine in
Utah and the Chuquicamata mine in northern Chile produce molybdenum as a
byproduct of copper mining.
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Alloys[edit] ****
A plate of molybdenum copper alloy
About 86% of molybdenum produced is used in metallurgy, with the rest used in
chemical applications. The estimated global use is structural steel 35%,
stainless_steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool & high-speed steels 9%, cast_iron 6%,
molybdenum elemental metal 6%, and superalloys 5%.[48]
Molybdenum can withstand extreme temperatures without significantly expanding
or softening, making it useful in environments of intense heat, including
military armor, aircraft parts, electrical contacts, industrial motors, and
filaments.[11][49]
Most high-strength steel alloys (for example, 41xx_steels) contain 0.25% to 8%
molybdenum.[7] Even in these small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of
molybdenum are used each year in stainless_steels, tool_steels, cast irons, and
high-temperature superalloys.[39]
Molybdenum is also valued in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and
weldability.[39][41] Molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type-300
stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially so in the so-called
superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO and 1925hMo).
Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to
dissolve iron atoms from the surface.[contradictory] Molybdenum is also used to
enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and
martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless steels.[citation_needed]
Because of its lower density and more stable price, molybdenum is sometimes
used in place of tungsten.[39] An example is the 'M' series of high-speed
steels such as M2, M4 and M42 as substitution for the 'T' steel series, which
contain tungsten. Molybdenum can also be used as a flame-resistant coating for
other metals. Although its melting point is 2,623Â Ã‚Â°C (4,753Â Ã‚Â°F), molybdenum
rapidly oxidizes at temperatures above 760Â Ã‚Â°C (1,400Â Ã‚Â°F) making it better-
suited for use in vacuum environments.[49]
TZM (Mo (~99%), Ti (~0.5%), Zr (~0.08%) and some C) is a corrosion-resisting
molybdenum superalloy that resists molten fluoride salts at temperatures above
1,300Â Ã‚Â°C (2,370Â Ã‚Â°F). It has about twice the strength of pure Mo, and is more
ductile and more weldable, yet in tests it resisted corrosion of a standard
eutectic salt (FLiBe) and salt vapors used in molten_salt_reactors for 1100
hours with so little corrosion that it was difficult to measure.[50][51]
Other molybdenum-based alloys that do not contain iron have only limited
applications. For example, because of its resistance to molten zinc, both pure
molybdenum and molybdenum-tungsten alloys (70%/30%) are used for piping,
stirrers and pump impellers that come into contact with molten zinc.[52]
**** Other applications as a pure element[edit] ****
    * Molybdenum powder is used as a fertilizer for some plants, such as
      cauliflower[39]
    * Elemental molybdenum is used in NO, NO2, NOx analyzers in power plants
      for pollution controls. At 350Â Ã‚Â°C (662Â Ã‚Â°F), the element acts as a
      catalyst for NO2/NOx to form NO molecules for detection by infrared
      light.[53]
    * Molybdenum anodes replace tungsten in certain low voltage X-ray sources
      for specialized uses such as mammography[54]
    * The radioactive isotope molybdenum-99 is used to generate technetium-99m,
      used for medical imaging[55] The isotope is handled and stored as the
      molybdate.[56]
*** Compounds (14% of global use)[edit] ***
    * Molybdenum_disulfide (MoS2) is used as a solid lubricant and a high-
      pressure high-temperature (HPHT) anti-wear agent. It forms strong films
      on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases Ã¢Â€Â” in the
      event of a catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of molybdenum
      prevents contact of the lubricated parts.[57] It also has semiconducting
      properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene
      in electronics applications.[58] MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in
      hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and
      oxygen.[59]
    * Molybdenum_disilicide (MoSi2) is an electrically conducting ceramic with
      primary use in heating_elements operating at temperatures above 1500Â Ã‚Â°C
      in air.[60]
    * Molybdenum_trioxide (MoO3) is used as an adhesive between enamels and
      metals.[28] Lead_molybdate (wulfenite) co-precipitated with lead chromate
      and lead sulfate is a bright-orange pigment used with ceramics and
      plastics.[61]
    * The molybdenum-based mixed oxides are versatile catalysts in the chemical
      industry. Some examples are the catalysts for the selective oxidation of
      propylene to acrolein and acrylic acid, the ammoxidation of propylene to
      acrylonitrile.[62][63] Suitable catalysts and process for the direct
      selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid are being researched.[64]
      [65][66][67]
    * Ammonium_heptamolybdate is used in biological staining.
    * Molybdenum coated soda lime glass is used in CIGS (copper_indium_gallium
      selenide) solar_cells, called CIGS_solar_cells.
    * Phosphomolybdic_acid is a stain used in thin-layer_chromatography.
***** Biological role[edit] *****
**** Mo-containing enzymes[edit] ****
Molybdenum is an essential element in most organisms. In fact a scarcity of
molybdenum in the Earth's early oceans may have strongly influenced evolution
of eukaryotic_life (which includes all plants and animals).[68]
At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes have been identified, mostly in
bacteria.[69][70] those enzymes include aldehyde_oxidase, sulfite_oxidase and
xanthine_oxidase.[11] With one exception, Mo in proteins is bound by
molybdopterin to give the molybdenum_cofactor.[71]
In terms of function, molybdoenzymes catalyze the oxidation and sometimes
reduction of certain small molecules in the process of regulating nitrogen,
sulfur, and carbon.[72] In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of
xanthine to uric_acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine
oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is
directly proportional to the amount of molybdenum in the body. However, an
extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an
inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum
concentration also affects protein_synthesis, metabolism, and growth.[73]
Mo is as a component in most nitrogenases. Among molybdoenzymes, nitrogenases
are unique in lacking the molybdopterin.[74][75] Nitrogenases catalyze the
production of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen:
           N  2   + 8 &#xA0;  H  +   + 8 &#xA0;  e  &#x2212;   + 16 &#xA0; A T
      P + 16 &#xA0;  H  2   O &#x27F6; 2 &#xA0; N  H  3   +  H  2   + 16 &#xA0;
      A D P + 16 &#xA0;  P  i      {\displaystyle \mathrm {N_{2}+8\ H^{+}+8\ e^
      {-}+16\ ATP+16\ H_{2}O\longrightarrow 2\ NH_{3}+H_{2}+16\ ADP+16\ P_{i}}
      }  [\mathrm {N_{2}+8\ H^{+}+8\ e^{-}+16\ ATP+16\ H_{2}O\longrightarrow 2\
      NH_{3}+H_{2}+16\ ADP+16\ P_{i}} ]
The biosynthesis of the FeMoco active_site is highly complex.[76]
Structure of the FeMoco active site of nitrogenase.
[Skeletal_structure_of_a_molybdopterin_with_a_single_molybdenum_atom_bound_to
both_of_the_thiolate_groups]
The molybdenum_cofactor (pictured) is composed of a molybdenum-free organic
complex called molybdopterin, which has bound an oxidized molybdenum(VI) atom
through adjacent sulfur (or occasionally selenium) atoms. Except for the
ancient nitrogenases, all known Mo-using enzymes use this cofactor.
Molybdate is transported in the body as MoO42Ã¢ÂˆÂ’.[73]
**** Human metabolism and deficiency[edit] ****
Molybdenum is an essential trace dietary_element.[77] Four mammalian Mo-
dependent enzymes are known, all of them harboring a pterin-based molybdenum
cofactor (Moco) in their active site: sulfite_oxidase, xanthine_oxidoreductase,
aldehyde_oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reductase.[78] People severely
deficient in molybdenum have poorly functioning sulfite oxidase and are prone
to toxic reactions to sulfites in foods.[79][80] The human body contains about
0.07Â mg of molybdenum per kilogram of body weight,[81] with higher
concentrations in the liver and kidneys and lower in the vertebrae.[39]
Molybdenum is also present within human tooth_enamel and may help prevent its
decay.[82]
Acute toxicity has not been seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly
on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median_lethal_dose (LD50) as low
as 180Â mg/kg for some Mo compounds.[83] Although human toxicity data is
unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than
10Â mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility,
low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver.
[84][85] Sodium_tungstate is a competitive_inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary
tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.[39]
Low soil concentration of molybdenum in a geographical band from northern China
to Iran results in a general dietary molybdenum_deficiency, and is associated
with increased rates of esophageal_cancer.[86][87] Compared to the United
States, which has a greater supply of molybdenum in the soil, people living in
those areas have about 16 times greater risk for esophageal squamous_cell
carcinoma.[88]
Molybdenum deficiency has also been reported as a consequence of non-molybdenum
supplemented total_parenteral_nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long
periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, in much
the same way as molybdenum_cofactor_deficiency. However (presumably since pure
molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the
neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor
deficiency.[89]
**** Related diseases[edit] ****
A congenital molybdenum_cofactor_deficiency disease, seen in infants, is an
inability to synthesize molybdenum_cofactor, the heterocyclic molecule
discussed above that binds molybdenum at the active site in all known human
enzymes that use molybdenum. The resulting deficiency results in high levels of
sulfite and urate, and neurological damage.[90][91]
**** Copper-molybdenum antagonism[edit] ****
High levels of molybdenum can interfere with the body's uptake of copper,
producing copper_deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding
to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in
urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea,
stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These
symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection.
[92] The effective copper deficiency can be aggravated by excess sulfur.[39]
[93]
Copper reduction or deficiency can also be deliberately induced for therapeutic
purposes by the compound ammonium_tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red
anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was
first used therapeutically in the treatment of copper_toxicosis in animals. It
was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's_disease, a hereditary copper
metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption
in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an
inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane
translocation process that is dependent on copper ions.[94] This is a promising
avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related_macular
degeneration, and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of
blood vessels.[95][96]
***** Dietary recommendations[edit] *****
In 2000, the then U.S. Institute of Medicine (now the National_Academy_of
Medicine, NAM) updated its Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for molybdenum. If there is not
sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated
Adequate_Intake (AI) is used instead.
An AI of 2Â micrograms (ÃÂ¼g) of molybdenum per day was established for infants
up to 6Â months of age, and 3Â ÃÂ¼g/day from 7 to 12Â months of age, both for males
and females. For older children and adults, the following daily RDAs have been
established for molybdenum: 17Â ÃÂ¼g from 1 to 3Â years of age, 22Â ÃÂ¼g from 4 to
8Â years, 34Â ÃÂ¼g from 9 to 13Â years, 43Â ÃÂ¼g from 14 to 18 years, and 45Â ÃÂ¼g for
persons 19 years old and older. All these RDAs are valid for both sexes.
Pregnant or lactating females from 14 to 50Â years of age have a higher daily
RDA of 50Â ÃÂ¼g of molybdenum.
As for safety, the NAM sets tolerable_upper_intake_levels (ULs) for vitamins
and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of molybdenum, the UL is
2000Â ÃÂ¼g/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as
Dietary_Reference_Intakes (DRIs).[97]
The European_Food_Safety_Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of
information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI)
instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the
same as in United States. For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at
65Â ÃÂ¼g/day. Pregnant and lactating women have the same AI. For children aged
1Ã¢Â€Â“14Â years, the AIs increase with age from 15 to 45Â ÃÂ¼g/day. The adult AIs
are higher than the U.S. RDAs,[98] but on the other hand, the European Food
Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 600Â ÃÂ¼g/
day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.[99]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving
is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For molybdenum labeling
purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 75Â ÃÂ¼g, but as of May 27, 2016 it was
revised to 45Â ÃÂ¼g.[100] A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is
provided at Reference_Daily_Intake. The original deadline to be in compliance
was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the Food_and_Drug_Administration
(FDA) released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020
for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.[101]
***** Food sources[edit] *****
Average daily intake varies between 120 and 240 ÃÂ¼g/day, which is higher than
dietary recommendations.[84] Pork, lamb, and beef liver each have approximately
1.5 parts per million of molybdenum. Other significant dietary sources include
green beans, eggs, sunflower seeds, wheat flour, lentils, cucumbers, and cereal
grain.[11]
***** Precautions[edit] *****
Molybdenum dusts and fumes, generated by mining or metalworking, can be toxic,
especially if ingested (including dust trapped in the sinuses and later
swallowed).[83] Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the
eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides
should be avoided.[102][103] OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible
molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5Â mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60Â to
600Â mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains.[104]
At levels of 5000Â mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately_dangerous_to_life_and
health.[105]
