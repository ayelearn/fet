Bioinorganic chemistry is a field that examines the role of metals in biology.
Bioinorganic chemistry includes the study of both natural phenomena such as the
behavior of metalloproteins as well as artificially introduced metals,
including those that are non-essential, in medicine and toxicology. Many
biological_processes such as respiration depend upon molecules that fall within
the realm of inorganic_chemistry. The discipline also includes the study of
inorganic models or mimics that imitate the behaviour of metalloproteins.[1]
As a mix of biochemistry and inorganic_chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry is
important in elucidating the implications of electron-transfer proteins,
substrate bindings and activation, atom and group transfer chemistry as well as
metal properties in biological chemistry.

***** Composition of living organisms[edit] *****
About 99% of mammals' mass are the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium,
chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur.[2] The organic
compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the
carbon and nitrogen and most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.[2]
The entire collection of metal-containing biomolecules in a cell is called the
metallome.
***** History[edit] *****
Paul_Ehrlich used organoarsenic (âarsenicalsâ) for the treatment of
syphilis, demonstrating the relevance of metals, or at least metalloids, to
medicine, that blossomed with Rosenbergâs discovery of the anti-cancer
activity of cisplatin (cis-PtCl2(NH3)2). The first protein ever crystallized
(see James_B._Sumner) was urease, later shown to contain nickel at its active
site. Vitamin_B12, the cure for pernicious_anemia was shown
crystallographically by Dorothy_Crowfoot_Hodgkin to consist of a cobalt in a
corrin macrocycle. The Watson-Crick structure for DNA demonstrated the key
structural role played by phosphate-containing polymers.
***** Themes in bioinorganic chemistry[edit] *****
Several distinct systems are of identifiable in bioinorganic chemistry. Major
areas include:
**** Metal ion transport and storage[edit] ****
This topic covers a diverse collection of ion_channels, ion pumps (e.g.
NaKATPase), vacuoles, siderophores, and other proteins and small molecules
which control the concentration of metal ions in the cells. One issue is that
many metals that are metabolically required are not readily available owing to
solubility or scarcity. Organisms have developed a number of strategies for
collecting such elements and transporting them.
**** Enzymology[edit] ****
Many reactions in life sciences involve water and metal ions are often at the
catalytic centers (active sites) for these enzymes, i.e. these are
metalloproteins. Often the reacting water is a ligand (see metal_aquo_complex).
Examples of hydrolase enzymes are carbonic_anhydrase, metallophosphatases, and
metalloproteinases. Bioinorganic chemists seek to understand and replicate the
function of these metalloproteins.
Metal-containing electron transfer proteins are also common. They can be
organized into three major classes: iron-sulfur_proteins (such as rubredoxins,
ferredoxins, and Rieske_proteins), blue copper_proteins, and cytochromes. These
electron transport proteins are complementary to the non-metal electron
transporters nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin_adenine
dinucleotide (FAD). The nitrogen_cycle make extensive use of metals for the
redox interconversions.
4Fe-4S clusters serve as electron-relays in proteins.
**** Toxicity[edit] ****
Several metal ions are toxic to humans and other animals. The bioinorganic
chemistry of lead in the context of its toxicity has been reviewed.[3]
**** Oxygen transport and activation proteins[edit] ****
Main article: Transition_metal_dioxygen_complex
Aerobic life make extensive use of metals such as iron, copper, and manganese.
Heme is utilized by red_blood_cells in the form of hemoglobin for oxygen
transport and is perhaps the most recognized metal system in biology. Other
oxygen transport systems include myoglobin, hemocyanin, and hemerythrin.
Oxidases and oxygenases are metal systems found throughout nature that take
advantage of oxygen to carry out important reactions such as energy generation
in cytochrome_c_oxidase or small molecule oxidation in cytochrome_P450_oxidases
or methane_monooxygenase. Some metalloproteins are designed to protect a
biological system from the potentially harmful effects of oxygen and other
reactive oxygen-containing molecules such as hydrogen_peroxide. These systems
include peroxidases, catalases, and superoxide_dismutases. A complementary
metalloprotein to those that react with oxygen is the oxygen_evolving_complex
present in plants. This system is part of the complex protein machinery that
produces_oxygen as plants perform photosynthesis.
Myoglobin is a prominent subject in bioinorganic chemistry, with particular
attention to the iron-heme complex that is anchored to the protein.
**** Bioorganometallic chemistry[edit] ****
Bioorganometallic systems feature metal-carbon bonds as structural elements or
as intermediates. Bioorganometallic enzymes and proteins include the
hydrogenases, FeMoco in nitrogenase, and methylcobalamin. These naturally
occurring organometallic_compounds. This area is more focused on the
utilization of metals by unicellular organisms. Bioorganometallic compounds are
significant in environmental_chemistry.[4]
Structure of FeMoco, the catalytic center of nitrogenase.
**** Metals in medicine[edit] ****
Main article: Metals_in_medicine
A number of drugs contain metals. This theme relies on the study of the design
and mechanism of action of metal-containing pharmaceuticals, and compounds that
interact with endogenous metal ions in enzyme active sites. The most widely
used anti-cancer drug is cisplatin. MRI_contrast_agent commonly contain
gadolinium. Lithium_carbonate has been used to treat the manic phase of bipolar
disorder. Gold antiarthritic drugs, e.g. auranofin have been commerciallized.
Carbon_monoxide-releasing_molecules are metal complexes have been developed to
suppress inflammation by releasing small amounts of carbon monoxide. The
cardiovascular and neuronal importance of nitric_oxide has been examined,
including the enzyme nitric_oxide_synthase. (See also: nitrogen_assimilation.)
Besides, metallic transition complexes based on triazolopyrimidines have been
tested against several parasite strains.[5]
**** Environmental chemistry[edit] ****
Main article: Environmental_chemistry
Environmental chemistry traditionally emphasizes the interaction of heavy
metals with organisms. Methylmercury has caused major disaster called Minamata
disease. Arsenic_poisoning is a widespread problem owing largely to arsenic
contamination_of_groundwater, which affects many millions of people in
developing countries. The metabolism of mercury- and arsenic-containing
compounds involves cobalamin-based enzymes.
**** Biomineralization[edit] ****
Main article: Biomineralization
Biomineralization is the process by which living organisms produce minerals,
often to harden or stiffen existing tissues. Such tissues are called
mineralized_tissues.[6][7][8] Examples include silicates in algae and diatoms,
carbonates in invertebrates, and calcium_phosphates and carbonates in
vertebrates.Other examples include copper, iron and gold deposits involving
bacteria. Biologically-formed minerals often have special uses such as magnetic
sensors in magnetotactic_bacteria (Fe3O4), gravity sensing devices (CaCO3,
CaSO4, BaSO4) and iron storage and mobilization (Fe2O3â¢H2O in the protein
ferritin). Because extracellular[9] iron is strongly involved in inducing
calcification,[10][11] its control is essential in developing shells; the
protein ferritin plays an important role in controlling the distribution of
iron.[12]
***** Types of inorganic elements in biology[edit] *****
**** Alkali and alkaline earth metals[edit] ****
Like many antibiotics, monensin-A is an ionophore that tighlty bind Na+ (shown
in yellow).[13]
The abundant inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The most important
ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate, and
bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise gradients across cell_membranes
maintains osmotic_pressure and pH.[14] Ions are also critical for nerves and
muscles, as action_potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of
electrolytes between the extracellular_fluid and the cytosol.[15] Electrolytes
enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion
channels. For example, muscle_contraction depends upon the movement of calcium,
sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.
[16]
**** Transition metals[edit] ****
The transition_metals are usually present as trace_elements in organisms, with
zinc and iron being most abundant.[17][18][19] These metals are used in some
proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as
catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin.[20] These cofactors
are bound tightly to a specific protein; although enzyme cofactors can be
modified during catalysis, cofactors always return to their original state
after catalysis has taken place. The metal micronutrients are taken up into
organisms by specific transporters and bound to storage proteins such as
ferritin or metallothionein when not being used.[21][22] Cobalt is essential
for the functioning of vitamin_B12.[23]
**** Main group compounds[edit] ****
Many other elements aside from metals are bio-active. Sulfur and phosphorus are
required for all life. Phosphorus almost exclusively exists as phosphate and
its various esters. Sulfur exists in a variety of oxidation states, ranging
from sulfate (SO42â) down to sulfide (S2â). Selenium is a trace element
involved in proteins that are antioxidants. Cadmium is important because of its
toxicity.[24]
