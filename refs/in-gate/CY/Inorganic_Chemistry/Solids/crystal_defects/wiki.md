Crystalline_solids exhibit a periodic crystal_structure. The positions of atoms
or molecules occur on repeating fixed distances, determined by the unit cell
parameters. However, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in most crystalline
materials is not perfect. The regular patterns are interrupted by
crystallographic defects.[2][3][4][5]

***** Point defects[edit] *****
Point defects are defects that occur only at or around a single lattice point.
They are not extended in space in any dimension. Strict limits for how small a
point defect is are generally not defined explicitly. However, these defects
typically involve at most a few extra or missing atoms. Larger defects in an
ordered structure are usually considered dislocation loops. For historical
reasons, many point defects, especially in ionic crystals, are called centers:
for example a vacancy in many ionic solids is called a luminescence center, a
color center, or F-center. These dislocations permit ionic transport through
crystals leading to electrochemical reactions. These are frequently specified
using KrÃ¶gerâVink_notation.
    * Vacancy_defects are lattice sites which would be occupied in a perfect
      crystal, but are vacant. If a neighboring atom moves to occupy the vacant
      site, the vacancy moves in the opposite direction to the site which used
      to be occupied by the moving atom. The stability of the surrounding
      crystal structure guarantees that the neighboring atoms will not simply
      collapse around the vacancy. In some materials, neighboring atoms
      actually move away from a vacancy, because they experience attraction
      from atoms in the surroundings. A vacancy (or pair of vacancies in an
      ionic solid) is sometimes called a Schottky_defect.
    * Interstitial_defects are atoms that occupy a site in the crystal
      structure at which there is usually not an atom. They are generally high
      energy configurations. Small atoms (mostly impurities) in some crystals
      can occupy interstices without high energy, such as hydrogen in
      palladium.

    * A nearby pair of a vacancy and an interstitial is often called a Frenkel
      defect or Frenkel pair. This is caused when an ion moves into an
      interstitial site and creates a vacancy.
    * Due to fundamental limitations of material purification methods,
      materials are never 100% pure, which by definition induces defects in
      crystal structure. In the case of an impurity, the atom is often
      incorporated at a regular atomic site in the crystal structure. This is
      neither a vacant site nor is the atom on an interstitial site and it is
      called a substitutional defect. The atom is not supposed to be anywhere
      in the crystal, and is thus an impurity. In some cases where the radius
      of the substitutional atom (ion) is substantially smaller than that of
      the atom (ion) it is replacing, its equilibrium position can be shifted
      away from the lattice site. These types of substitutional defects are
      often referred to as off-center_ions. There are two different types of
      substitutional defects: Isovalent substitution and aliovalent
      substitution. Isovalent substitution is where the ion that is
      substituting the original ion is of the same oxidation state as the ion
      it is replacing. Aliovalent substitution is where the ion that is
      substituting the original ion is of a different oxidation state than the
      ion it is replacing. Aliovalent substitutions change the overall charge
      within the ionic compound, but the ionic compound must be neutral.
      Therefore, a charge compensation mechanism is required. Hence either one
      of the metals is partially or fully oxidised or reduced, or ion vacancies
      are created.
    * Antisite defects[6][7] occur in an ordered alloy or compound when atoms
      of different type exchange positions. For example, some alloys have a
      regular structure in which every other atom is a different species; for
      illustration assume that type A atoms sit on the corners of a cubic
      lattice, and type B atoms sit in the center of the cubes. If one cube has
      an A atom at its center, the atom is on a site usually occupied by a B
      atom, and is thus an antisite defect. This is neither a vacancy nor an
      interstitial, nor an impurity.
    * Topological defects are regions in a crystal where the normal chemical
      bonding environment is topologically different from the surroundings. For
      instance, in a perfect sheet of graphite (graphene) all atoms are in
      rings containing six atoms. If the sheet contains regions where the
      number of atoms in a ring is different from six, while the total number
      of atoms remains the same, a topological defect has formed. An example is
      the Stone_Wales_defect in nanotubes, which consists of two adjacent 5-
      membered and two 7-membered atom rings.

example.
    * Also amorphous solids may contain defects. These are naturally somewhat
      hard to define, but sometimes their nature can be quite easily
      understood. For instance, in ideally bonded amorphous silica all Si atoms
      have 4 bonds to O atoms and all O atoms have 2 bonds to Si atom. Thus
      e.g. an O atom with only one Si bond (a dangling_bond) can be considered
      a defect in silica.[8] Moreover, defects can also be defined in amorphous
      solids based on empty or densely packed local atomic neighbourhoods, and
      the properties of such 'defects' can be shown to be similar to normal
      vacancies and interstitials in crystals.[9][10][11]
    * Complexes can form between different kinds of point defects. For example,
      if a vacancy encounters an impurity, the two may bind together if the
      impurity is too large for the lattice. Interstitials can form 'split
      interstitial' or 'dumbbell' structures where two atoms effectively share
      an atomic site, resulting in neither atom actually occupying the site.
      [12][13]
***** Line defects[edit] *****
Line defects can be described by gauge theories.
Dislocations are linear defects, around which the atoms of the crystal lattice
are misaligned.[14] There are two basic types of dislocations, the edge
dislocation and the screw dislocation. "Mixed" dislocations, combining aspects
of both types, are also common.
An edge dislocation is shown. The dislocation line is presented in blue, the
Burgers vector b in black.
Edge dislocations are caused by the termination of a plane of atoms in the
middle of a crystal. In such a case, the adjacent planes are not straight, but
instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal
structure is perfectly ordered on either side. The analogy with a stack of
paper is apt: if a half a piece of paper is inserted in a stack of paper, the
defect in the stack is only noticeable at the edge of the half sheet.
The screw dislocation is more difficult to visualise, but basically comprises a
structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect
(dislocation line) by the atomic planes of atoms in the crystal lattice.
The presence of dislocation results in lattice strain (distortion). The
direction and magnitude of such distortion is expressed in terms of a Burgers
vector (b). For an edge type, b is perpendicular to the dislocation line,
whereas in the cases of the screw type it is parallel. In metallic materials, b
is aligned with close-packed crystallographic directions and its magnitude is
equivalent to one interatomic spacing.
Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break
their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge.
It is the presence of dislocations and their ability to readily move (and
interact) under the influence of stresses induced by external loads that leads
to the characteristic malleability of metallic materials.
Dislocations can be observed using transmission_electron_microscopy, field_ion
microscopy and atom_probe techniques. Deep-level_transient_spectroscopy has
been used for studying the electrical activity of dislocations in
semiconductors, mainly silicon.
Disclinations are line defects corresponding to "adding" or "subtracting" an
angle around a line. Basically, this means that if you track the crystal
orientation around the line defect, you get a rotation. Usually, they were
thought to play a role only in liquid crystals, but recent developments suggest
that they might have a role also in solid materials, e.g. leading to the self-
healing of cracks.[15]
***** Planar defects[edit] *****
Origin of stacking faults: Different stacking sequences of close-packed
crystals
    * Grain_boundaries occur where the crystallographic direction of the
      lattice abruptly changes. This usually occurs when two crystals begin
      growing separately and then meet.
    * Antiphase boundaries occur in ordered alloys: in this case, the
      crystallographic direction remains the same, but each side of the
      boundary has an opposite phase: For example, if the ordering is usually
      ABABABAB (hexagonal_close-packed crystal), an antiphase boundary takes
      the form of ABABBABA.
    * Stacking_faults occur in a number of crystal structures, but the common
      example is in close-packed structures. They are formed by a local
      deviation of the stacking sequence of layers in a crystal. An example
      would be the ABABCABAB stacking sequence.
    * A twin_boundary is a defect that introduces a plane of mirror symmetry in
      the ordering of a crystal. For example, in cubic_close-packed crystals,
      the stacking sequence of a twin boundary would be ABCABCBACBA.
    * On planes of single_crystals, steps between atomically flat terraces can
      also be regarded as planar defects. It has been shown that such defects
      and their geometry have significant influence on the adsorption of
      organic molecules[16]
***** Bulk defects[edit] *****
    * Three-dimensional macroscopic or bulk defects, such as pores, cracks, or
      inclusions
    * Voids â small regions where there are no atoms, and which can be
      thought of as clusters of vacancies
    * Impurities can cluster together to form small regions of a different
      phase. These are often called precipitates.
***** Mathematical classification methods[edit] *****
A successful mathematical classification method for physical lattice defects,
which works not only with the theory of dislocations and other defects in
crystals but also, e.g., for disclinations in liquid crystals and for
excitations in superfluid 3He, is the topological homotopy theory.[17]
***** Computer simulation methods[edit] *****
Density_functional_theory, classical molecular_dynamics and kinetic_Monte_Carlo
[18] simulations are widely used to study the properties of defects in solids
with computer simulations.[9][10][11][19][20][21][22] Simulating jamming of
hard spheres of different sizes and/or in containers with non-commeasurable
sizes using the LubachevskyâStillinger_algorithm can be an effective
technique for demonstrating some types of crystallographic defects.[23]
