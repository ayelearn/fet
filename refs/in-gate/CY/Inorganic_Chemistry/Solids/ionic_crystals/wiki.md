The crystal structure of sodium_chloride, NaCl, a typical ionic compound. The
purple spheres represent sodium cations, Na+, and the green spheres represent
chloride anions, Clâ.
In chemistry, an ionic compound is a chemical_compound composed of ions held
together by electrostatic_forces termed ionic_bonding. The compound is neutral
overall, but consists of positively charged ions called cations and negatively
charged ions called anions. These can be simple_ions such as the sodium (Na+)
and chloride (Clâ) in sodium_chloride, or polyatomic species such as the
ammonium (NH+
4) and carbonate (CO2â
3) ions in ammonium_carbonate. Individual ions within an ionic compound usually
have multiple nearest neighbours, so are not considered to be part of
molecules, but instead part of a continuous three-dimensional network, usually
in a crystalline_structure.
Ionic compounds containing hydrogen_ions (H+) are classified as acids, and
those containing basic ions hydroxide (OHâ) or oxide (O2â) are classified
as bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be
formed by acidâbase_reactions. Ionic compounds can also be produced from
their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent, precipitation,
freezing, a solid-state_reaction, or the electron_transfer reaction of reactive
metals with reactive non-metals, such as halogen gases.
Ionic compounds typically have high melting and boiling_points, and are hard
and brittle. As solids they are almost always electrically_insulating, but when
melted or dissolved they become highly conductive, because the ions are
mobilized.

***** History of discovery[edit] *****
The word ion is the Greek á¼°ÏÎ½, ion, "going", the present participle of
á¼°Î­Î½Î±Î¹, ienai, "to go". This term was introduced by English physicist and
chemist Michael_Faraday in 1834 for the then-unknown species that goes from one
electrode to the other through an aqueous medium.[1][2]
X-ray spectrometer developed by Bragg
In 1913 the crystal structure of sodium chloride was determined by William
Henry_Bragg and William_Lawrence_Bragg.[3][4][5] This revealed that there were
six equidistant nearest-neighbours for each atom, demonstrating that the
constituents were not arranged in molecules or finite aggregates, but instead
as a network with long-range crystalline order.[5] Many other inorganic
compounds were also found to have similar structural features.[5] These
compounds were soon described as being constituted of ions rather than neutral
atoms, but proof of this hypothesis was not found until the mid-1920s, when X-
ray_reflection experiments (which detect the density of electrons), were
performed.[5][6]
Principal contributors to the development of a theoretical treatment of ionic
crystal structures were Max_Born, Fritz_Haber, Alfred_LandÃ©, Erwin_Madelung,
Paul_Peter_Ewald, and Kazimierz_Fajans.[7] Born predicted crystal energies
based on the assumption of ionic constituents, which showed good correspondence
to thermochemical measurements, further supporting the assumption.[5]
***** Formation[edit] *****
[White_crystals_form_a_mineral_sample_of_halite,_shown_against_a_black
background.]
Halite, the mineral form of sodium_chloride, forms when salty water evaporates
leaving the ions behind.
Ionic compounds can be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation,
precipitation, or freezing. Reactive metals such as the alkali_metals can react
directly with the highly electronegative halogen gases to form an ionic
product.[8] They can also be synthesized as the product of a high temperature
reaction between solids.[9]
If the ionic compound is soluble in a solvent, it can be obtained as a solid
compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution.[10] As the
solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the
remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation
occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely
in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals.[11] Another
method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution
at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the
temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound
nucleates.[10]
Insoluble ionic compounds can be precipitated by mixing two solutions, one with
the cation and one with the anion in it. Because all solutions are electrically
neutral, the two solutions mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite
charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic
compound, it is important to ensure they do not also precipitate.[12] If the
two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they
will react with one another in what is called an acidâbase_reaction or a
neutralization_reaction to form water.[13] Alternately the counterions can be
chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will
remain soluble as spectator_ions.[12]
If the solvent is water in either the evaporation or precipitation method of
formation, in many cases the ionic crystal formed also includes water_of
crystallization, so the product is known as a hydrate, and can have very
different chemical properties.[14]
Molten salts will solidify on cooling to below their freezing_point.[15] This
is sometimes used for the solid-state_synthesis of complex ionic compounds from
solid reactants, which are first melted together.[16] In other cases, the solid
reactants do not need to be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state
reaction_route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into
a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring
reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in
the oven.[9] Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct
stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other
species.[9]
In some reactions between highly reactive metals (usually from Group_1 or Group
2) and highly electronegative halogen gases, or water, the atoms can be ionized
by electron_transfer,[17] a process thermodynamically understood using the
BornâHaber_cycle.[18]
***** Bonding[edit] *****
A schematic electron_shell diagram of sodium and fluorine atoms undergoing a
redox reaction to form sodium_fluoride. Sodium loses its outer electron to give
it a stable electron_configuration, and this electron enters the fluorine atom
exothermically. The oppositely charged ions â typically a great many of them
â are then attracted to each other to form a solid.
Main article: Ionic_bonding
Ions in ionic compounds are primarily held together by the electrostatic_forces
between the charge distribution of these bodies, and in particular the ionic
bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative
charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations.[19] There is also
a small additional attractive force from van_der_Waals_interactions which
contributes only around 1â2% of the cohesive energy for small ions.[20] When
a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron_shells (most simple
ions have closed_shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs,[21]
due to the Pauli_exclusion_principle.[22] The balance between these forces
leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are
separated by a specific equilibrium distance.[21]
If the electronic_structure of the two interacting bodies is affected by the
presence of one another, covalent interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to
the overall energy of the compound formed.[23] Ionic compounds are rarely
purely ionic, i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds
between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in
caesium_fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency.[24][25] Conversely,
covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and
can be considered to have a partial ionic character.[23] The circumstances
under which a compound will have ionic or covalent character can typically be
understood using Fajans'_rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each
ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most ionic character will
have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with
a high charge.[26] More generally HSAB_theory can be applied, whereby the
compounds with the most ionic character are those consisting of hard acids and
hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in
electronegativities between the anion and cation.[27][28] This difference in
electronegativities means that the charge separation, and resulting dipole
moment, is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess electrons
on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).[29]
***** Structure[edit] *****
The unit cell of the zinc_blende structure
Ions typically pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in an
arrangement that minimizes the lattice_energy (maximizing attractions and
minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction
of all sites with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only the
charges and distances are required to determine the electrostatic interaction
energy. For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are
geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each
possible crystal structure, the total electrostatic energy can be related to
the electrostatic energy of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a
multiplicative constant called the Madelung_constant[21] that can be
efficiently computed using an Ewald_sum.[30] When a reasonable form is assumed
for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled
using the BornâLandÃ©_equation,[31] the BornâMayer_equation, or in the
absence of structural information, the Kapustinskii_equation.[32]
Using an even simpler approximation of the ions as impenetrable hard spheres,
the arrangement of anions in these systems are often related to close-packed
arrangements of spheres, with the cations occupying tetrahedral or octahedral
interstices.[33][34] Depending on the stoichiometry of the ionic compound, and
the coordination (principally determined by the radius_ratio) of cations and
anions, a variety of structures are commonly observed,[35] and theoretically
rationalized by Pauling's_rules.[36]

Some ionic liquids, particularly with mixtures of anions or cations, can be
cooled rapidly enough that there is not enough time for crystal nucleation to
occur, so an ionic glass is formed (with no long-range order).[52]
**** Defects[edit] ****

Schottky defect
See also: crystallographic_defect
Within an ionic crystal, there will usually be some point defects, but to
maintain electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs.[53] Frenkel_defects
consist of a cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be
generated anywhere in the bulk of the crystal,[53] occurring most commonly in
compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than
the anions.[54] Schottky_defects consist of one vacancy of each type, and are
generated at the surfaces of a crystal,[53] occurring most commonly in
compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are
of similar size.[54] If the cations have multiple possible oxidation_states,
then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron
deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-
stoichiometric_compound.[53] Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the
formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy.[55] When
the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are
possible.[53] All of these point defects can be generated via thermal
vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are
energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater
concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects
can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice
sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an
ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid_state_ionic_conductivity.[53] When
vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and
annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the
surface of the crystal (Schottky). Defects in the crystal structure generally
expand the lattice_parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal.[53]
Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which
causes them to experience a different crystal-field_symmetry, especially in the
case of different cations exchanging lattice sites.[53] This results in a
different splitting of d-electron_orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and
hence colour) can change with defect concentration.[53]
***** Properties[edit] *****
**** Acidity/basicity[edit] ****
Ionic compounds containing hydrogen_ions (H+) are classified as acids, and
those containing electropositive cations[56] and basic anions ions hydroxide
(OHâ) or oxide (O2â) are classified as bases. Other ionic compounds are
known as salts and can be formed by acidâbase_reactions.[57] If the compound
is the result of a reaction between a strong_acid and a weak_base, the result
is an acidic_salt. If it is the result of a reaction between a strong_base and
a weak_acid, the result is a basic_salt. If it is the result of a reaction
between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak
acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the
conjugate_base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium_acetate.
Some ions are classed as amphoteric, being able to react with either an acid or
a base.[58] This is also true of some compounds with ionic character, typically
oxides or hydroxides of less-electropositive metals (so the compound also has
significant covalent character), such as zinc_oxide, aluminium_hydroxide,
aluminium_oxide and lead(II)_oxide.[59]
**** Melting and boiling points[edit] ****
Electrostatic forces between particles are strongest when the charges are high,
and the distance between the nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the
compounds generally have very high melting and boiling_points and a low vapour
pressure.[60] Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the
structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account.[61] Above their melting
point ionic solids melt and become molten_salts (although some ionic compounds
such as aluminium_chloride and iron(III)_chloride show molecule-like structures
in the liquid phase).[62] Inorganic_compounds with simple ions typically have
small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room
temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point
below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100 Â°C), and are termed
ionic_liquids.[63] Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge
distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a
role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.
[64]
Even when the local structure and bonding of an ionic solid is disrupted
sufficiently to melt it, there are still strong long-range electrostatic forces
of attraction holding the liquid together and preventing ions boiling to form a
gas phase.[65] This means that even room temperature ionic liquids have low
vapour pressures, and require substantially higher temperatures to boil.[65]
Boiling points exhibit similar trends to melting points in terms of the size of
ions and strength of other interactions.[65] When vapourized, the ions are
still not freed of one another. For example, in the vapour phase sodium
chloride exists as diatomic "molecules".[66]
**** Brittleness[edit] ****
Most ionic compounds are very brittle. Once they reach the limit of their
strength, they cannot deform malleably, because the strict alignment of
positive and negative ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes
fracture via cleavage.[67] As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the
melting point) a ductileâbrittle_transition occurs, and plastic_flow becomes
possible by the motion of dislocations.[67][68]
**** Compressibility[edit] ****
The compressibility of an ionic compound is strongly determined by its
structure, and in particular the coordination_number. For example, halides with
the caesium chloride structure (coordination number 8) are less compressible
than those with the sodium chloride structure (coordination number 6), and less
again than those with a coordination number of 4.[69]
**** Solubility[edit] ****
When ionic compounds dissolve, the individual ions dissociate and are solvated
by the solvent and dispersed throughout the resulting solution.[70] Because the
ions are released into solution when dissolved, and can conduct charge, soluble
ionic compounds are the most common class of strong_electrolytes, and their
solutions have a high electrical_conductivity.[71]
The aqueous solubility of a variety of ionic compounds as a function of
temperature. Some compounds exhibiting unusual solubility behaviour have been
included.
The solubility is highest in polar_solvents (such as water) or ionic_liquids,
but tends to be low in nonpolar_solvents (such as petrol/gasoline).[72] This is
principally because the resulting ionâdipole_interactions are significantly
stronger than ion-induced dipole interactions, so the heat_of_solution is
higher. When the oppositely charged ions in the solid ionic lattice are
surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule, the solid ions are pulled
out of the lattice and into the liquid. If the solvation energy exceeds the
lattice_energy, the negative net enthalpy_change_of_solution provides a
thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and
dissolve in the liquid. In addition, the entropy_change_of_solution is usually
positive for most solid solutes like ionic compounds, which means that their
solubility increases when the temperature increases.[73] There are some unusual
ionic compounds such as cerium(III)_sulfate, where this entropy change is
negative, due to extra order induced in the water upon solution, and the
solubility decreases with temperature.[73]
**** Electrical conductivity[edit] ****
Although ionic compounds contain charged atoms or clusters, these materials do
not typically conduct_electricity to any significant extent when the substance
is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than
stationary in a crystal_lattice. This is achieved to some degree at high
temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and
solid_state_ionic_conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are
dissolved_in_a_liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity
because the ions become completely mobile.[74] This conductivity gain upon
dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic
compounds.[75]
In some unusual ionic compounds: fast_ion_conductors, and ionic glasses,[52]
one or more of the ionic components has a significant mobility, allowing
conductivity even while the material as a whole remains solid.[76] This is
often highly temperature dependant, and may be the result of either a phase
change or a high defect concentration.[76] These materials are used in all
solid-state supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel_cells, and in various kinds of
chemical_sensors.[77][78]

The colour_of_an_ionic_compound is often different to the colour_of_an_aqueous
solution containing the constituent ions,[79] or the hydrated form of the same
compound.[14]
The anions in compounds with bonds with the most ionic character tend to be
colourless (with an absorption_band in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum).
[80] In compounds with less ionic character, their colour deepens through
yellow, orange, red and black (as the absorption band shifts to longer
wavelengths into the visible spectrum).[80]
The absorption band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength when they
are involved in more covalent interactions.[80] This occurs during hydration of
metal ions, so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion absorbing in
the infrared can become colourful in solution.[80]
***** Uses[edit] *****
Ionic compounds have long had a wide variety of uses and applications. Many
minerals are ionic.[81] Humans have processed common_salt (sodium chloride) for
over 8000 years, using it first as a food seasoning and preservative, and now
also in manufacturing, agriculture, water conditioning, for de-icing roads, and
many other uses.[82] Many ionic compounds are so widely used in society that
they go by common names unrelated to their chemical identity. Examples of this
include borax, calomel, milk_of_magnesia, muriatic_acid, oil_of_vitriol,
saltpeter, and slaked_lime.[83]
Soluble ionic compounds like salt can easily be dissolved to provide
electrolyte solutions. This is a simple way to control the concentration and
ionic_strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative
properties, including increasing the osmotic_pressure, and causing freezing-
point_depression and boiling-point_elevation.[84] Because the solutes are
charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution.
[85] The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical
double_layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of
emulsions and suspensions.[86]
The chemical identity of the ions added is also important in many uses. For
example, fluoride containing compounds are dissolved to supply fluoride ions
for water_fluoridation.[87]
Solid ionic compounds have long been used as paint pigments, and are resistant
to organic solvents, but are sensitive to acidity or basicity.[88] Since 1801
pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds
as sources of colour in fireworks.[89] Under intense heat, the electrons in the
metal ions or small molecules can be excited.[90] These electrons later return
to lower energy states, and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic
of the species present.[91][92]
In chemistry, ionic compounds are often used as precursors for high-temperature
solid-state synthesis.[93]
Many metals are geologically most abundant as ionic compounds within ores.[94]
To obtain the elemental materials, these ores are processed by smelting or
electrolysis, in which redox_reactions occur (often with a reducing agent such
as carbon) such that the metal ions gain electrons to become neutral atoms.[95]
[96]
***** Nomenclature[edit] *****
See also: IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry
According to the nomenclature recommended by IUPAC, ionic compounds are named
according to their composition, not their structure.[97] In the most simple
case of a binary ionic compound with no possible ambiguity about the charges
and thus the stoichiometry, the common name is written using two words.[98] The
name of the cation (the unmodified element name for monatomic cations) comes
first, followed by the name of the anion.[99][100] For example, MgCl2 is named
magnesium_chloride, and Na2SO4 is named sodium_sulfate (SO2â
4, sulfate, is an example of a polyatomic_ion). To obtain the empirical_formula
from these names, the stoichiometry can be deduced from the charges on the
ions, and the requirement of overall charge neutrality.
If there are multiple different cations and/or anions, multiplicative prefixes
(di-, tri-, tetra-, ...) are often required to indicate the relative
compositions,[101] and cations then anions are listed in alphabetical order.
[102] For example, KMgCl3 is named magnesium_potassium_trichloride to
distinguish it from K2MgCl4, magnesium_dipotassium_tetrachloride[103] (note
that in both the empirical formula and the written name, the cations appear in
alphabetical order, but the order varies between them because the symbol for
potassium is K).[104] When one of the ions already has a multiplicative prefix
within its name, the alternate multiplicative prefixes (bis-, tris-,
tetrakis-, ...) are used.[105] For example, Ba(BrF4)2 is named barium_bis
(tetrafluoridobromate).[106]
Compounds containing one or more elements which can exist in a variety of
charge/oxidation_states will have a stoichiometry that depends on which
oxidation states are present, to ensure overall neutrality. This can be
indicated in the name by specifying either the oxidation state of the elements
present, or the charge on the ions.[106] Because of the risk of ambiguity in
allocating oxidation states, IUPAC prefers direct indication of the ionic
charge numbers.[106] These are written as an arabic integer followed by the
sign (... , 2â, 1â, 1+, 2+, ...) in parentheses directly after the name of
the cation (without a space separating them).[106] For example, FeSO4 is named
iron(2+)_sulfate (with the 2+ charge on the Fe2+ ions balancing the 2â charge
on the sulfate ion), whereas Fe2(SO4)3 is named iron(3+)_sulfate (because the
two iron ions in each formula_unit each have a charge of 3+, to balance the
2â on each of the three sulfate ions).[106] Stock_nomenclature, still in
common use, writes the oxidation_number in Roman_numerals (... , âII, âI,
0, I, II, ...). So the examples given above would be named iron(II)_sulfate and
iron(III)_sulfate respectively.[107] For simple ions the ionic charge and the
oxidation number are identical, but for polyatomic ions they often differ. For
example, the uranyl(2+) ion, UO2+
2, has uranium in an oxidation state of +6, so would be called a dioxouranium
(VI) ion in Stock nomenclature.[108] An even older naming system for metal
cations, also still widely used, appended the suffixes -ous and -ic to the
Latin root of the name, to give special names for the low and high oxidation
states.[109] For example, this scheme uses "ferrous" and "ferric", for iron(II)
and iron(III) respectively,[109] so the examples given above were classically
named ferrous_sulfate and ferric_sulfate.

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ This structure type has a variable lattice parameter c/a ratio, and the
      exact Madelung constant depends on this.
   2. ^ This structure has been referred to in references as yttrium(III)
      chloride and chromium(III)_chloride, but both are now known as the RhBr3
      structure type.
   3. ^ The reference lists this structure as MoCl3, which is now known as the
      RhBr3 structure.
   4. ^ The reference lists this structure as FeCl3, which is now known as the
      BiI3 structure type.
   5. ^ This structure type can accommodate any charges on A and B that add up
      to six. When both are three the charge structure is equivalent to that of
      corrundum.[45] The structure also has a variable lattice parameter c/
      a ratio, and the exact Madelung constant depends on this.
   6. ^ However, in some cases such as MgAl2O4 the larger cation occupies the
      smaller tetrahedral site.[46]
