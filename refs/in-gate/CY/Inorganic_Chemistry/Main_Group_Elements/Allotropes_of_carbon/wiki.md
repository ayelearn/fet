Two allotropes of carbon: graphite and diamond.
Materials made only out of carbon
Eight allotropes of carbon: a) diamond, b) graphite, c) lonsdaleite, d) C60
buckminsterfullerene, e) C540, Fullerite f) C70, g) amorphous_carbon, and h)
single-walled carbon_nanotube.
Carbon is capable of forming many allotropes (structurally different forms of
the same element) due to its valency. Well-known forms of carbon include
diamond and graphite. In recent decades, many more allotropes, or forms of
carbon, have been discovered and researched including ball shapes such as
buckminsterfullerene and sheets such as graphene. Larger scale structures of
carbon include nanotubes, nanobuds and nanoribbons. Other unusual forms of
carbon exist at very high temperatures or extreme pressures. Around 500
hypothetical 3-periodic allotropes of carbon are known at the present time,
according to the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA).[1]

***** Diamond[edit] *****
Main article: Diamond
Diamond is a well known allotrope of carbon. The hardness and high dispersion
of_light of diamond make it useful for both industrial applications and
jewelry. Diamond is the hardest known natural mineral. This makes it an
excellent abrasive and makes it hold polish and luster extremely well. No known
naturally occurring substance can cut (or even scratch) a diamond, except
another diamond.
The market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its
gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness
and heat conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of
diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why
80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20 tonnes annually)
are unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as bort, are destined for
industrial use. In addition to mined diamonds, synthetic_diamonds found
industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s;
another 400 million carats (80 tonnes) of synthetic diamonds are produced
annually for industrial use, which is nearly four times the mass of natural
diamonds mined over the same period.
The dominant industrial use of diamond is cutting, drilling (drill_bits),
grinding (diamond edged cutters), and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these
technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are not
gem-quality can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or
saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing
applications (due to its extraordinary hardness). Specialized applications
include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see
diamond_anvil), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized
windows of technical apparatuses.
With the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamond,
future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement
is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable to build microchips
from, or the use of diamond as a heat_sink in electronics. Significant research
efforts in Japan, Europe, and the United_States are under way to capitalize on
the potential offered by diamond's unique material properties, combined with
increased quality and quantity of supply starting to become available from
synthetic diamond manufacturers.
Each carbon atom in a diamond is covalently bonded to four other carbons in a
tetrahedron. These tetrahedrons together form a 3-dimensional network of six-
membered carbon rings (similar to cyclohexane), in the chair_conformation,
allowing for zero bond_angle strain. This stable network of covalent_bonds and
hexagonal rings is the reason that diamond is so strong. Although graphite is
the most stable allotrope of carbon under standard laboratory conditions (273
or 298 K, 1 atm), a recent computational study indicated that under idealized
conditions (T = 0, p = 0), diamond is the most stable allotrope by 1.1 kJ/mol
compared to graphite.[2]
***** Graphite[edit] *****
Main article: Graphite
Graphite, named by Abraham_Gottlob_Werner in 1789, from the Greek
Î³ÏÎ¬ÏÎµÎ¹Î½ (graphein, "to draw/write", for its use in pencils) is one of
the most common allotropes of carbon. Unlike diamond, graphite is an electrical
conductor. Thus, it can be used in, for instance, electrical arc lamp
electrodes. Likewise, under standard_conditions, graphite is the most stable
form of carbon. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the standard_state
for defining the heat_of_formation of carbon compounds.
Graphite conducts_electricity, due to delocalization of the pi_bond electrons
above and below the planes of the carbon atoms. These electrons are free to
move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is only
conducted along the plane of the layers. In diamond, all four outer electrons
of each carbon atom are 'localized' between the atoms in covalent bonding. The
movement of electrons is restricted and diamond does not conduct an electric
current. In graphite, each carbon atom uses only 3 of its 4 outer energy level
electrons in covalently bonding to three other carbon atoms in a plane. Each
carbon atom contributes one electron to a delocalized system of electrons that
is also a part of the chemical bonding. The delocalized electrons are free to
move throughout the plane. For this reason, graphite conducts electricity along
the planes of carbon atoms, but does not conduct in a direction at right angles
to the plane.
Graphite powder is used as a dry lubricant. Although it might be thought that
this industrially important property is due entirely to the loose_interlamellar
coupling between sheets in the structure, in fact in a vacuum environment (such
as in technologies for use in space), graphite was found to be a very poor
lubricant. This fact led to the discovery that graphite's lubricity is due to
adsorbed air and water between the layers, unlike other layered dry lubricants
such as molybdenum_disulfide. Recent studies suggest that an effect called
superlubricity can also account for this effect.
When a large number of crystallographic defects(physical) bind these planes
together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known
as pyrolytic_carbon, a useful material in blood-contacting implants such as
prosthetic heart_valves.
Graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon. Contrary to popular belief,
high-purity graphite does not readily burn, even at elevated temperatures.[3]
For this reason, it is used in nuclear_reactors and for high-temperature
crucibles for melting metals.[4] At very high temperatures and pressures
(roughly 2000 Â°C and 5 GPa), it can be transformed into diamond.[citation
needed]
Natural and crystalline graphites are not often used in pure form as structural
materials due to their shear-planes, brittleness and inconsistent mechanical
properties.
In its pure glassy (isotropic) synthetic forms, pyrolytic_graphite and carbon
fiber graphite are extremely strong, heat-resistant (to 3000 Â°C) materials,
used in reentry shields for missile nosecones, solid_rocket engines, high
temperature_reactors, brake shoes and electric_motor brushes.
Intumescent or expandable graphites are used in fire seals, fitted around the
perimeter of a fire door. During a fire the graphite intumesces (expands and
chars) to resist fire penetration and prevent the spread of fumes. A typical
start expansion temperature (SET) is between 150 and 300 Â°C.
Density: graphite's specific gravity is 2.3, which makes it lighter than
diamonds.
Chemical activity: it is slightly more reactive than diamond. This is because
the reactants are able to penetrate between the hexagonal layers of carbon
atoms in graphite. It is unaffected by ordinary solvents, dilute acids, or
fused alkalis. However, chromic_acid oxidizes it to carbon dioxide.
**** Graphene[edit] ****
Main article: Graphene
A single layer of graphite is called graphene and has extraordinary electrical,
thermal, and physical properties. It can be produced by epitaxy on an
insulating or conducting substrate or by mechanical exfoliation (repeated
peeling) from graphite. Its applications may include replacing silicon in high-
performance electronic devices. With two layers stacked, bilayer_graphene
results with different properties.
**** Graphenylene[edit] ****
Graphenylene[5] is a single layer carbon material with biphenylene-like
subunits as basis in its hexagonal lattice structure. It is also known as
biphenylene-carbon.
**** AA'-graphite[edit] ****
AA'-graphite is an allotrope of carbon similar to graphite, but where the
layers are positioned differently to each other as compared to the order in
graphite.
***** Amorphous carbon[edit] *****
Main article: Amorphous_carbon
Amorphous carbon is the name used for carbon that does not have any crystalline
structure. As with all glassy materials, some short-range order can be
observed, but there is no long-range pattern of atomic positions. While
entirely amorphous carbon can be produced, most amorphous carbon actually
contains microscopic crystals of graphite-like,[6] or even diamond-like carbon.
[7]
Coal and soot or carbon_black are informally called amorphous carbon. However,
they are products of pyrolysis (the process of decomposing a substance by the
action of heat), which does not produce true amorphous carbon under normal
conditions.

Main article: Fullerene
The buckminsterfullerenes, or usually just fullerenes or buckyballs for short,
were discovered in 1985 by a team of scientists from Rice University and the
University of Sussex, three of whom were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry. They are named for the resemblance to the geodesic structures
devised by Richard_Buckminster_"Bucky"_Fuller. Fullerenes are positively curved
molecules of varying sizes composed entirely of carbon, which take the form of
a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube.
As of the early twenty-first century, the chemical and physical properties of
fullerenes are still under heavy study, in both pure and applied research labs.
In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal use â
binding specific antibiotics to the structure to target resistant bacteria and
even target certain cancer cells such as melanoma.
**** Carbon nanotubes[edit] ****
Main article: Carbon_nanotube
Carbon nanotubes, also called buckytubes, are cylindrical carbon molecules with
novel properties that make them potentially useful in a wide variety of
applications (e.g., nano-electronics, optics, materials applications, etc.).
They exhibit extraordinary strength, unique electrical properties, and are
efficient conductors of heat. Inorganic_nanotubes have also been synthesized. A
nanotube is a member of the fullerene structural family, which also includes
buckyballs. Whereas buckyballs are spherical in shape, a nanotube is
cylindrical, with at least one end typically capped with a hemisphere of the
buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter
of a nanotube is on the order of a few nanometers (approximately 50,000 times
smaller than the width of a human hair), while they can be up to several
centimeters in length. There are two main types of nanotubes: single-walled
nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled_nanotubes (MWNTs).
**** Carbon nanobuds[edit] ****
Computer models of stable nanobud structures
Main article: Carbon_nanobud
Carbon nanobuds are a newly discovered allotrope of carbon in which fullerene
like "buds" are covalently attached to the outer sidewalls of the carbon
nanotubes. This hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and
carbon nanotubes. For instance, they have been found to be exceptionally good
field_emitters.
**** Schwarzites[edit] ****
Schwarzites are negatively curved carbon surfaces originally proposed by
decorating triply_periodic_minimal_surfaces with carbon atoms. The geometric
topology of the structure is determined by the presence of ring defects, such
as heptagons and octagons, to graphene's hexagonal lattice.[8] (Negative
curvature bends surfaces outwards like a saddle rather than bending inwards
like a sphere.)
Recent work has proposed Zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) may be Schwarzites.
The name, ZTC, derives from their origin inside the pores of zeolites,
crystalline silicon_dioxide minerals. A vapor of carbon-containing molecules is
injected into the zeolite, where the carbon gathers on the pores' walls,
creating the negative curve. Dissolving the zeolite leaves the carbon. A team
generated structures by decorating the pores of a zeolite with carbon through a
Monte_Carlo_method. Some of these structures were recognized as Schwarzites and
they proposed a route to their synthesis.[9]
***** Glassy carbon[edit] *****
A large sample of glassy carbon.
Main article: Glassy_carbon
Glassy carbon or vitreous carbon is a class of non-graphitizing carbon widely
used as an electrode material in electrochemistry, as well as for high-
temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices.
It was first produced by Bernard Redfern in the mid-1950s at the laboratories
of The Carborundum Company, Manchester, UK. He had set out to develop a polymer
matrix to mirror a diamond structure and discovered a resole (phenolic) resin
that would, with special preparation, set without a catalyst. Using this resin
the first glassy carbon was produced.
The preparation of glassy carbon involves subjecting the organic precursors to
a series of heat treatments at temperatures up to 3000 Â°C. Unlike many non-
graphitizing carbons, they are impermeable to gases and are chemically
extremely inert, especially those prepared at very high temperatures. It has
been demonstrated that the rates of oxidation of certain glassy carbons in
oxygen, carbon dioxide or water vapor are lower than those of any other carbon.
They are also highly resistant to attack by acids. Thus, while normal graphite
is reduced to a powder by a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids
at room temperature, glassy carbon is unaffected by such treatment, even after
several months.
***** Atomic and diatomic carbon[edit] *****
Main articles: Atomic_carbon and diatomic_carbon
Under certain conditions, carbon can be found in its atomic form. It is formed
by passing large electric currents through carbon under very low pressures. It
is extremely unstable, but it is an intermittent product used in the creation
of carbenes.[10]
Diatomic_carbon can also be found under certain conditions. It is often
detected via spectroscopy in extraterrestrial bodies, including comets and
certain stars.[11][12]
***** Carbon nanofoam[edit] *****
Main article: Carbon_nanofoam
Carbon nanofoam is the fifth known allotrope of carbon, discovered in 1997 by
Andrei_V._Rode and co-workers at the Australian_National_University in
Canberra. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung
together in a loose three-dimensional web.
Each cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon atoms
linked in graphite-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the
inclusion of heptagons among the regular hexagonal pattern. This is the
opposite of what happens in the case of buckminsterfullerenes, in which carbon
sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of pentagons.
The large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an aerogel,
but with 1% of the density of previously produced carbon_aerogels â only a
few times the density of air at sea_level. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon
nanofoam is a poor electrical_conductor.
***** Carbide-derived carbon[edit] *****
Main article: Carbide-derived_carbon
Carbide-derived carbon (CDC) is a family of carbon materials with different
surface geometries and carbon ordering that are produced via selective removal
of metals from metal carbide precursors, such as TiC, SiC, Ti3AlC2, Mo2C, etc.
This synthesis is accomplished using chlorine treatment, hydrothermal
synthesis, or high-temperature selective metal desorption under vacuum.
Depending on the synthesis method, carbide precursor, and reaction parameters,
multiple carbon allotropes can be achieved, including endohedral particles
composed of predominantly amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, epitaxial
graphene, nanocrystalline diamond, onion-like carbon, and graphitic ribbons,
barrels, and horns. These structures exhibit high porosity and specific surface
areas, with highly tunable pore diameters, making them promising materials for
supercapacitor-based energy storage, water filtration and capacitive
desalinization, catalyst support, and cytokine removal.[13]
***** Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond)[edit] *****
Main article: Lonsdaleite
Lonsdaleite is a hexagonal allotrope of the carbon allotrope diamond, believed
to form from graphite present in meteorites upon their impact to Earth. The
great heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into diamond, but
retains graphite's hexagonal crystal_lattice. Hexagonal diamond has also been
synthesized in the laboratory, by compressing and heating graphite either in a
static press or using explosives. It can also be produced by the thermal
decomposition of a polymer, poly(hydridocarbyne), at atmospheric pressure,
under inert gas atmosphere (e.g. argon, nitrogen), starting at temperature
110 Â°C (230 Â°F).[14][15][16]
***** Linear acetylenic carbon (LAC)[edit] *****
Main article: Linear_acetylenic_carbon
A one-dimensional carbon polymer with the structure -(C:::C)n-.
***** Other possible forms[edit] *****
Crystal structure of C8 cubic carbon
    * D-carbon: D-carbon proposed by theorists in 2018.[17] D-carbon is a
      orthorhombic sp3 carbon allotrope (6 atoms per cell). Total-energy
      calculations demonstrate that D-carbon is energetically more favorable
      than the previously proposed T6 structure (with 6 atoms per cell) as well
      as many others.
    * Chaoite is a mineral believed to have been formed in meteorite impacts.
      It has been described as slightly harder than graphite with a reflection
      color of grey to white. However, the existence of carbyne phases is
      disputed â see the entry on chaoite for details.
    * Metallic carbon: Theoretical studies have shown that there are regions in
      the phase_diagram, at extremely high pressures, where carbon has metallic
      character.[18]
    * bcc-carbon: At ultrahigh pressures of above 1000 GPa, diamond is
      predicted to transform into the so-called C8 structure, a body-centered
      cubic structure with 8 atoms in the unit cell. This cubic carbon phase
      might have importance in astrophysics. Its structure is known in one of
      the metastable phases of silicon and is similar to cubane.[19] Superdense
      and superhard material resembling this phase has been synthesized and
      published in 1979 [20] and 2008.[21][22] The structure of this phase was
      proposed in 2012 as carbon sodalite.[23]
    * bct-carbon: Body-centered tetragonal carbon proposed by theorists in 2010
      [24][25]
    * M-carbon: Monoclinic C-centered carbon was first thought to have been
      created in 1963 by compressing graphite at room temperature. Its
      structure was theorized in 2006,[26] then in 2009 it was related[27] to
      those experimental observations. Many structural candidates, including
      bct-carbon, were proposed to be equally compatible with experimental data
      available at the time, until in 2012 it was theoretically proven that
      this structure is kinetically likeliest to form from graphite.[28][29]
      High-resolution data appeared shortly after, demonstrating that among all
      structure candidates only M-carbon is compatible with experiment.[30][31]
    * Q-carbon: Ferromagnetic carbon discovered in 2015.[32]
    * T-carbon: Every carbon atom in diamond is replaced with a carbon
      tetrahedron (hence 'T-carbon'). This was proposed by theorists in 1985.
      [33]
    * There is evidence that white_dwarf stars have a core of crystallized
      carbon and oxygen nuclei. The largest of these found in the universe so
      far, BPM_37093, is located 50 light-years (4.7Ã1014 km) away in the
      constellation Centaurus. A news release from the Harvard-Smithsonian
      Center_for_Astrophysics described the 2,500-mile (4,000 km)-wide stellar
      core as a diamond,[34] and it was named as Lucy, after the Beatles' song
      "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds";[35] however, it is more likely an exotic
      form of carbon.
    * Prismane C8 is a theoretically-predicted metastable carbon allotrope
      comprising an atomic cluster of eight carbon atoms, with the shape of an
      elongated_triangular_bipyramidâa six-atom triangular prism with two
      more atoms above and below its bases.[36]
The K4 crystal
    * The Laves_graph or K4 crystal is a theoretically-predicted three-
      dimensional crystalline metastable carbon structure in which each carbon
      atom is bonded to three others, at 120Â° angles (like graphite), but
      where the bond planes of adjacent layers lie at an angle of 70.5Â°,
      rather than coinciding[37][38]
    * Penta-graphene
    * Haeckelites Ordered arrangements of pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons
      which can either be flat or tubular.
    * Phagraphene Graphene allotrope with distorted Dirac cones.
    * Novamene A combination of both hexagonal diamond and sp2 hexagons as in
      graphene.[39]
    * Protomene A hexagonal crystal structure with a fully relaxed primitive
      cell involving 48 atoms. Of these, 12 atoms have the potential to switch
      hybridization between sp2 and sp3, forming dimers.[40]
***** Variability of carbon[edit] *****
Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon: pure forms of the same
element that differ in structure.
The system of carbon allotropes spans an astounding range of extremes,
considering that they are all merely structural formations of the same element.
Between diamond and graphite:
    * Diamond crystallizes in the cubic_system but graphite crystallizes in the
      hexagonal_system.
    * Diamond is clear and transparent, but graphite is black and opaque.
    * Diamond is the hardest mineral known (10 on the Mohs_scale), but graphite
      is one of the softest (1â2 on Mohs_scale).
    * Diamond is the ultimate abrasive, but graphite is soft and is a very good
      lubricant.
    * Diamond is an excellent electrical insulator, but graphene is an
      excellent conductor.
    * Diamond is an excellent thermal conductor, but some forms of graphite are
      used for thermal insulation (for example heat shields and firebreaks).
    * At standard temperature and pressure, graphite is the thermodynamically
      stable form. Thus diamonds do not exist forever. The conversion from
      diamond to graphite, however, has a very high activation_energy and is
      therefore extremely slow.
Despite the hardness of diamonds, the chemical bonds that hold the carbon atoms
in diamonds together are actually weaker than those that hold together
graphite. The difference is that in diamond, the bonds form an inflexible
three-dimensional lattice. In graphite, the atoms are tightly bonded into
sheets, but the sheets can slide easily over each other, making graphite soft.
