Orbitrap mass spectrometer
Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-
charge_ratio of ions. The results are typically presented as a mass_spectrum, a
plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry
is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as
complex mixtures.
A mass spectrum is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge
ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic_signature
of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the
chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical_compounds.
In a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, is
ionized, for example by bombarding it with electrons. This may cause some of
the sample's molecules to break into charged fragments or simply become charged
without fragmenting. These ions are then separated according to their mass-to-
charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an
electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo
the same amount of deflection.[1] The ions are detected by a mechanism capable
of detecting charged particles, such as an electron_multiplier. Results are
displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of
the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be
identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the
identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.

***** History[edit] *****
Further information: History_of_mass_spectrometry
Replica of J.J._Thomson's third mass spectrometer
In 1886, Eugen_Goldstein observed rays in gas_discharges under low pressure
that traveled away from the anode and through channels in a perforated cathode,
opposite to the direction of negatively charged cathode_rays (which travel from
cathode to anode). Goldstein called these positively charged anode_rays
"Kanalstrahlen"; the standard translation of this term into English is "canal
rays". Wilhelm_Wien found that strong electric or magnetic fields deflected the
canal rays and, in 1899, constructed a device with perpendicular electric and
magnetic fields that separated the positive rays according to their charge-to-
mass ratio (Q/m). Wien found that the charge-to-mass ratio depended on the
nature of the gas in the discharge tube. English scientist J.J._Thomson later
improved on the work of Wien by reducing the pressure to create the mass
spectrograph.
Calutron mass spectrometers were used in the Manhattan_Project for uranium
enrichment.
The word spectrograph had become part of the international_scientific
vocabulary by 1884.[2][3] Early spectrometry devices that measured the mass-to-
charge ratio of ions were called mass_spectrographs which consisted of
instruments that recorded a spectrum of mass values on a photographic_plate.[4]
[5] A mass spectroscope is similar to a mass spectrograph except that the beam
of ions is directed onto a phosphor screen.[6] A mass spectroscope
configuration was used in early instruments when it was desired that the
effects of adjustments be quickly observed. Once the instrument was properly
adjusted, a photographic plate was inserted and exposed. The term mass
spectroscope continued to be used even though the direct illumination of a
phosphor screen was replaced by indirect measurements with an oscilloscope.[7]
The use of the term mass spectroscopy is now discouraged due to the possibility
of confusion with light spectroscopy.[1][8] Mass spectrometry is often
abbreviated as mass-spec or simply as MS.[1]
Modern techniques of mass spectrometry were devised by Arthur_Jeffrey_Dempster
and F.W._Aston in 1918 and 1919 respectively.
Sector_mass_spectrometers known as calutrons were developed by Ernest_O.
Lawrence and used for separating the isotopes_of_uranium during the Manhattan
Project.[9] Calutron mass spectrometers were used for uranium_enrichment at the
Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee Y-12_plant established during World War II.
In 1989, half of the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics was awarded to Hans_Dehmelt and
Wolfgang_Paul for the development of the ion trap technique in the 1950s and
1960s.
In 2002, the Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry was awarded to John_Bennett_Fenn for the
development of electrospray_ionization (ESI) and Koichi_Tanaka for the
development of soft_laser_desorption (SLD) and their application to the
ionization of biological macromolecules, especially proteins.[10]
***** Parts of a mass spectrometer[edit] *****
Schematics of a simple mass spectrometer with sector type mass analyzer. This
one is for the measurement of carbon dioxide isotope ratios (IRMS) as in the
carbon-13 urea_breath_test
A mass spectrometer consists of three components: an ion source, a mass
analyzer, and a detector. The ionizer converts a portion of the sample into
ions. There is a wide variety of ionization techniques, depending on the phase
(solid, liquid, gas) of the sample and the efficiency of various ionization
mechanisms for the unknown species. An extraction system removes ions from the
sample, which are then targeted through the mass analyzer and into the
detector. The differences in masses of the fragments allows the mass analyzer
to sort the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. The detector measures the value
of an indicator quantity and thus provides data for calculating the abundances
of each ion present. Some detectors also give spatial information, e.g., a
multichannel plate.
**** Theoretical example[edit] ****
The following example describes the operation of a spectrometer mass analyzer,
which is of the sector type. (Other analyzer types are treated below.) Consider
a sample of sodium_chloride (table salt). In the ion source, the sample is
vaporized (turned into gas) and ionized (transformed into electrically charged
particles) into sodium (Na+) and chloride (Clâ) ions. Sodium atoms and ions
are monoisotopic, with a mass of about 23 u. Chloride atoms and ions come in
two isotopes with masses of approximately 35 u (at a natural abundance of about
75 percent) and approximately 37 u (at a natural abundance of about 25
percent). The analyzer part of the spectrometer contains electric and magnetic
fields, which exert forces on ions traveling through these fields. The speed of
a charged particle may be increased or decreased while passing through the
electric field, and its direction may be altered by the magnetic field. The
magnitude of the deflection of the moving ion's trajectory depends on its mass-
to-charge ratio. Lighter ions get deflected by the magnetic force more than
heavier ions (based on Newton's_second_law_of_motion, F = ma). The streams of
sorted ions pass from the analyzer to the detector, which records the relative
abundance of each ion type. This information is used to determine the chemical
element composition of the original sample (i.e. that both sodium and chlorine
are present in the sample) and the isotopic composition of its constituents
(the ratio of 35Cl to 37Cl).
***** Creating ions[edit] *****
Surface_ionization source at the Argonne_National_Laboratory linear accelerator
The ion_source is the part of the mass spectrometer that ionizes the material
under analysis (the analyte). The ions are then transported by magnetic or
electric_fields to the mass analyzer.
Techniques for ionization have been key to determining what types of samples
can be analyzed by mass spectrometry. Electron_ionization and chemical
ionization are used for gases and vapors. In chemical ionization sources, the
analyte is ionized by chemical ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the
source. Two techniques often used with liquid and solid biological samples
include electrospray_ionization (invented by John_Fenn[11]) and matrix-assisted
laser_desorption/ionization (MALDI, initially developed as a similar technique
"Soft Laser Desorption (SLD)" by K. Tanaka[12] for which a Nobel Prize was
awarded and as MALDI by M. Karas and F. Hillenkamp[13]).
**** Hard ionization and soft ionization[edit] ****
Quadrupole mass spectrometer and electrospray ion source used for Fenn's early
work
In mass spectrometry, ionization refers to the production of gas phase ions
suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs
in the ion_source. There are several ion_sources available; each has advantages
and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron_ionization
(EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass
spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for
structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of
unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under
identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to
HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate
electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-
MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.
Hard ionization techniques are processes which impart high quantities of
residual energy in the subject molecule invoking large degrees of fragmentation
(i.e. the systematic rupturing of bonds acts to remove the excess energy,
restoring stability to the resulting ion). Resultant ions tend to have m/
z lower than the molecular mass (other than in the case of proton transfer and
not including isotope peaks). The most common example of hard ionization is
electron ionization (EI).
Soft ionization refers to the processes which impart little residual energy
onto the subject molecule and as such result in little fragmentation. Examples
include fast_atom_bombardment (FAB), chemical_ionization (CI), atmospheric-
pressure_chemical_ionization (APCI), electrospray_ionization (ESI), and matrix-
assisted_laser_desorption/ionization (MALDI).
**** Inductively coupled plasma[edit] ****
Inductively coupled plasma ion source
Inductively_coupled_plasma (ICP) sources are used primarily for cation analysis
of a wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically
neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized
by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to
further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually
generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is
higher than the first of any other elements except He, O, F and Ne, but lower
than the second ionization energy of all except the most electropositive
metals. The heating is achieved by a radio-frequency current passed through a
coil surrounding the plasma.
**** Photoionization mass spectrometry[edit] ****
Photoionization can be used in experiments which seek to use mass spectrometry
as a means of resolving chemical kinetics mechanisms and isomeric product
branching.[14] In such instances a high energy photon, either X-ray or uv, is
used to dissociate stable gaseous molecules in a carrier gas of He or Ar. In
instances where a synchrotron light source is utilized, a tuneable photon
energy can be utilized to acquire a photoionization efficiency curve which can
be used in conjunction with the charge ratio m/z to fingerprint molecular and
ionic species.
**** Other ionization techniques[edit] ****
Others include glow_discharge, field_desorption (FD), fast_atom_bombardment
(FAB), thermospray, desorption/ionization_on_silicon (DIOS), Direct_Analysis_in
Real_Time (DART), atmospheric_pressure_chemical_ionization (APCI), secondary
ion_mass_spectrometry (SIMS), spark_ionization and thermal_ionization (TIMS).
[15]
***** Mass selection[edit] *****
Mass analyzers separate the ions according to their mass-to-charge_ratio. The
following two laws govern the dynamics of charged particles in electric and
magnetic fields in vacuum:
          F  = Q (  E  +  v  &#x00D7;  B  )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =Q
      (\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} )}  [\mathbf{F} = Q (\mathbf
      {E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})] (Lorentz_force_law);
          F  = m  a    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} }  [\mathbf {F}
      =m\mathbf {a} ] (Newton's_second_law of motion in non-relativistic case,
      i.e. valid only at ion velocity much lower than the speed of light).
Here F is the force applied to the ion, m is the mass of the ion, a is the
acceleration, Q is the ion charge, E is the electric field, and v Ã B is the
vector_cross_product of the ion velocity and the magnetic field
Equating the above expressions for the force applied to the ion yields:
         ( m  /  Q )  a  =  E  +  v  &#x00D7;  B  .   {\displaystyle (m/
      Q)\mathbf {a} =\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} .}  [(m/
      Q)\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{E}+ \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}.]
This differential_equation is the classic equation of motion for charged
particles. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely
determines the particle's motion in space and time in terms of m/Q. Thus mass
spectrometers could be thought of as "mass-to-charge spectrometers". When
presenting data, it is common to use the (officially) dimensionless m/z, where
z is the number of elementary_charges (e) on the ion (z=Q/e). This quantity,
although it is informally called the mass-to-charge ratio, more accurately
speaking represents the ratio of the mass number and the charge number, z.
There are many types of mass analyzers, using either static or dynamic fields,
and magnetic or electric fields, but all operate according to the above
differential equation. Each analyzer type has its strengths and weaknesses.
Many mass spectrometers use two or more mass analyzers for tandem_mass
spectrometry_(MS/MS). In addition to the more common mass analyzers listed
below, there are others designed for special situations.
There are several important analyser characteristics. The mass_resolving_power
is the measure of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different m/
z. The mass accuracy is the ratio of the m/z measurement error to the true m/z.
Mass accuracy is usually measured in ppm or milli_mass_units. The mass range is
the range of m/z amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic
range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration.
Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to
determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.
**** Sector instruments[edit] ****
ThermoQuest AvantGarde sector mass spectrometer
Further information: Sector_mass_spectrometer
A sector field mass analyzer uses a static electric and/or magnetic field to
affect the path and/or velocity of the charged particles in some way. As shown
above, sector_instruments bend the trajectories of the ions as they pass
through the mass analyzer, according to their mass-to-charge ratios, deflecting
the more charged and faster-moving, lighter ions more. The analyzer can be used
to select a narrow range of m/z or to scan through a range of m/z to catalog
the ions present.[16]
**** Time-of-flight[edit] ****
Further information: time-of-flight_mass_spectrometry
The time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer uses an electric_field to accelerate the ions
through the same potential, and then measures the time they take to reach the
detector. If the particles all have the same charge, their kinetic_energies
will be identical, and their velocities will depend only on their masses. Ions
with a lower mass will reach the detector first.[17] However, in reality, even
particles with the same m/z can arrive at different times at the detector,
because they have different initial velocities. The initial velocity is often
not dependent on the mass of the ion TOF-MS, and will turn into a difference in
the final velocity. Because of this, ions with the same m/z ratio will reach
the detector at a variety of times, which broadens the peaks shown on the count
vs m/z plot, but will generally not change the central location of the peaks,
since the average starting velocity of ions relative to the other analyzed ions
is generally centered at zero. To fix this problem, time-lag focusing/delayed
extraction has been coupled with TOF-MS.[18]
**** Quadrupole mass filter[edit] ****
Further information: Quadrupole_mass_analyzer
Quadrupole_mass_analyzers use oscillating electrical fields to selectively
stabilize or destabilize the paths of ions passing through a radio_frequency
(RF) quadrupole field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a
certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time,
but changes to the potentials on the rods allow a wide range of m/z values to
be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A
quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related
to the quadrupole_ion_trap, particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except
that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped
ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole. A
magnetically enhanced quadrupole mass analyzer includes the addition of a
magnetic field, either applied axially or transversely. This novel type of
instrument leads to an additional performance enhancement in terms of
resolution and/or sensitivity depending upon the magnitude and orientation of
the applied magnetic field.[19][20] A common variation of the transmission
quadrupole is the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The âtriple quadâ
has three consecutive quadrupole stages, the first acting as a mass filter to
transmit a particular incoming ion to the second quadrupole, a collision
chamber, wherein that ion can be broken into fragments. The third quadrupole
also acts as a mass filter, to transmit a particular fragment ion to the
detector. If a quadrupole is made to rapidly and repetitively cycle through a
range of mass filter settings, full spectra can be reported. Likewise, a triple
quad can be made to perform various scan types characteristic of tandem_mass
spectrometry.
**** Ion traps[edit] ****
*** Three-dimensional quadrupole ion trap[edit] ***
Further information: quadrupole_ion_trap
The quadrupole_ion_trap works on the same physical principles as the quadrupole
mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are
trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode
(usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes
(typically connected to DC or auxiliary AC potentials). The sample is ionized
either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, in
which case the ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap
electrode.
There are many mass/charge separation and isolation methods but the most
commonly used is the mass instability mode in which the RF potential is ramped
so that the orbit of ions with a mass a > b are stable while ions with mass b
become unstable and are ejected on the z-axis onto a detector. There are also
non-destructive analysis methods.
Ions may also be ejected by the resonance excitation method, whereby a
supplemental oscillatory excitation voltage is applied to the endcap
electrodes, and the trapping voltage amplitude and/or excitation voltage
frequency is varied to bring ions into a resonance condition in order of their
mass/charge ratio.[21][22]
*** Cylindrical ion trap[edit] ***
The cylindrical_ion_trap_mass_spectrometer (CIT) is a derivative of the
quadrupole ion trap where the electrodes are formed from flat rings rather than
hyperbolic shaped electrodes. The architecture lends itself well to
miniaturization because as the size of a trap is reduced, the shape of the
electric field near the center of the trap, the region where the ions are
trapped, forms a shape similar to that of a hyperbolic trap.
*** Linear quadrupole ion trap[edit] ***
A linear_quadrupole_ion_trap is similar to a quadrupole ion trap, but it traps
ions in a two dimensional quadrupole field, instead of a three-dimensional
quadrupole field as in a 3D quadrupole ion trap. Thermo Fisher's LTQ ("linear
trap quadrupole") is an example of the linear ion trap.[23]
A toroidal ion trap can be visualized as a linear quadrupole curved around and
connected at the ends or as a cross section of a 3D ion trap rotated on edge to
form the toroid, donut shaped trap. The trap can store large volumes of ions by
distributing them throughout the ring-like trap structure. This toroidal shaped
trap is a configuration that allows the increased miniaturization of an ion
trap mass analyzer. Additionally all ions are stored in the same trapping field
and ejected together simplifying detection that can be complicated with array
configurations due to variations in detector alignment and machining of the
arrays.[24]
As with the toroidal trap, linear traps and 3D quadrupole ion traps are the
most commonly miniaturized mass analyzers due to their high sensitivity,
tolerance for mTorr pressure, and capabilities for single analyzer tandem mass
spectrometry (e.g. product ion scans).[25]
*** Orbitrap[edit] ***
Orbitrap mass analyzer
Further information: Orbitrap
Orbitrap instruments are similar to Fourier_transform_ion_cyclotron_resonance
mass spectrometers (see text below). Ions are electrostatically trapped in an
orbit around a central, spindle shaped electrode. The electrode confines the
ions so that they both orbit around the central electrode and oscillate back
and forth along the central electrode's long axis. This oscillation generates
an image_current in the detector plates which is recorded by the instrument.
The frequencies of these image currents depend on the mass-to-charge ratios of
the ions. Mass spectra are obtained by Fourier_transformation of the recorded
image currents.
Orbitraps have a high mass accuracy, high sensitivity and a good dynamic range.
[26]
**** Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance[edit] ****
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer
Further information: Fourier_transform_ion_cyclotron_resonance
Fourier_transform_mass_spectrometry (FTMS), or more precisely Fourier_transform
ion_cyclotron_resonance MS, measures mass by detecting the image_current
produced by ions cyclotroning in the presence of a magnetic field. Instead of
measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an electron
multiplier, the ions are injected into a Penning_trap (a static electric/
magnetic ion_trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at
fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near
them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's
cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by
performing a Fourier_transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high
sensitivity (since each ion is "counted" more than once) and much higher
resolution and thus precision.[27][28]
Ion_cyclotron_resonance (ICR) is an older mass analysis technique similar to
FTMS except that ions are detected with a traditional detector. Ions trapped in
a Penning_trap are excited by an RF electric field until they impact the wall
of the trap, where the detector is located. Ions of different mass are resolved
according to impact time.
***** Detectors[edit] *****
A continuous dynode particle multiplier detector
The final element of the mass spectrometer is the detector. The detector
records either the charge induced or the current produced when an ion passes by
or hits a surface. In a scanning instrument, the signal produced in the
detector during the course of the scan versus where the instrument is in the
scan (at what m/Q) will produce a mass_spectrum, a record of ions as a function
of m/Q.
Typically, some type of electron_multiplier is used, though other detectors
including Faraday_cups and ion-to-photon_detectors are also used. Because the
number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically
quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal.
Microchannel_plate_detectors are commonly used in modern commercial
instruments.[29] In FTMS and Orbitraps, the detector consists of a pair of
metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only
pass near as they oscillate. No direct current is produced, only a weak AC
image current is produced in a circuit between the electrodes. Other inductive
detectors have also been used.[30]
***** Tandem mass spectrometry[edit] *****
Tandem mass spectrometry for biological molecules using ESI or MALDI
A tandem_mass_spectrometer is one capable of multiple rounds of mass
spectrometry, usually separated by some form of molecule fragmentation. For
example, one mass analyzer can isolate one peptide from many entering a mass
spectrometer. A second mass analyzer then stabilizes the peptide ions while
they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by collision-induced
dissociation (CID). A third mass analyzer then sorts the fragments produced
from the peptides. Tandem MS can also be done in a single mass analyzer over
time, as in a quadrupole_ion_trap. There are various methods for fragmenting
molecules for tandem MS, including collision-induced_dissociation (CID),
electron_capture_dissociation (ECD), electron_transfer_dissociation (ETD),
infrared_multiphoton_dissociation (IRMPD), blackbody_infrared_radiative
dissociation (BIRD), electron-detachment_dissociation (EDD) and surface-induced
dissociation (SID). An important application using tandem mass spectrometry is
in protein_identification.[31]
Tandem mass spectrometry enables a variety of experimental sequences. Many
commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such
routine sequences as selected_reaction_monitoring_(SRM) and precursor ion
scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the
second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most
often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is
duty_cycle limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of
detection of known molecules, notably in pharmacokinetic studies. Precursor ion
scanning refers to monitoring for a specific loss from the precursor ion. The
first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a
user-defined m/z value. This experiment is used to detect specific motifs
within unknown molecules.
Another type of tandem mass spectrometry used for radiocarbon_dating is
accelerator_mass_spectrometry (AMS), which uses very high voltages, usually in
the mega-volt range, to accelerate negative ions into a type of tandem mass
spectrometer.
***** Common mass spectrometer configurations and techniques[edit] *****
When a specific combination of source, analyzer, and detector becomes
conventional in practice, a compound acronym may arise to designate it
succinctly. One example is MALDI-TOF, which refers to a combination of a
matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization source with a time-of-flight mass
analyzer. Other examples include inductively_coupled_plasma-mass_spectrometry_
(ICP-MS), accelerator_mass_spectrometry_(AMS), thermal_ionization-mass
spectrometry_(TIMS) and spark_source_mass_spectrometry_(SSMS).
Certain applications of mass spectrometry have developed monikers that although
strictly speaking would seem to refer to a broad application, in practice have
come instead to connote a specific or a limited number of instrument
configurations. An example of this is isotope_ratio_mass_spectrometry_(IRMS),
which refers in practice to the use of a limited number of sector based mass
analyzers; this name is used to refer to both the application and the
instrument used for the application.
***** Separation techniques combined with mass spectrometry[edit] *****
An important enhancement to the mass resolving and mass determining
capabilities of mass spectrometry is using it in tandem with chromatographic
and other separation techniques.
**** Gas chromatography[edit] ****
Main article: Gas_chromatographyâmass_spectrometry
A gas chromatograph (right) directly coupled to a mass spectrometer (left)
A common combination is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS).
In this technique, a gas_chromatograph is used to separate different compounds.
This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the ion source, a
metallic filament to which voltage is applied. This filament emits electrons
which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding
predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass
spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.[32]
**** Liquid chromatography[edit] ****
Main article: Liquid_chromatographyâmass_spectrometry
Indianapolis_Museum_of_Art conservation scientist performing liquid
chromatographyâmass_spectrometry
Similar to gas chromatography MS (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC/MS or LC-MS) separates compounds chromatographically before
they are introduced to the ion source and mass spectrometer. It differs from
GC-MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a mixture of water and
organic solvents, instead of gas. Most commonly, an electrospray_ionization
source is used in LC-MS. Other popular and commercially available LC-MS ion
sources are atmospheric_pressure_chemical_ionization and atmospheric_pressure
photoionization. There are also some newly developed ionization techniques like

**** Capillary electrophoresisâmass spectrometry[edit] ****
Main article: Capillary_electrophoresisâmass_spectrometry
Capillary electrophoresisâmass spectrometry (CE-MS) is a technique that
combines the liquid separation process of capillary_electrophoresis with mass
spectrometry.[33] CE-MS is typically coupled to electrospray ionization.[34]
**** Ion mobility[edit] ****
Main article: Ion-mobility_spectrometryâmass_spectrometry
Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS/MS or IMMS) is a technique
where ions are first separated by drift time through some neutral gas under an
applied electrical potential gradient before being introduced into a mass
spectrometer.[35] Drift time is a measure of the radius relative to the charge
of the ion. The duty_cycle of IMS (the time over which the experiment takes
place) is longer than most mass spectrometric techniques, such that the mass
spectrometer can sample along the course of the IMS separation. This produces
data about the IMS separation and the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions in a
manner similar to LC-MS.[36]
The duty cycle of IMS is short relative to liquid chromatography or gas
chromatography separations and can thus be coupled to such techniques,
producing triple modalities such as LC/IMS/MS.[37]
***** Data and analysis[edit] *****

**** Data representations[edit] ****
See also: Mass_spectrometry_data_format
Mass spectrometry produces various types of data. The most common data
representation is the mass_spectrum.
Certain types of mass spectrometry data are best represented as a mass
chromatogram. Types of chromatograms include selected_ion_monitoring (SIM),
total_ion_current (TIC), and selected_reaction_monitoring (SRM), among many
others.
Other types of mass spectrometry data are well represented as a three-
dimensional contour_map. In this form, the mass-to-charge, m/z is on the x-
axis, intensity the y-axis, and an additional experimental parameter, such as
time, is recorded on the z-axis.
**** Data analysis[edit] ****
Mass spectrometry data analysis is specific to the type of experiment producing
the data. General subdivisions of data are fundamental to understanding any
data.
Many mass spectrometers work in either negative ion mode or positive ion mode.
It is very important to know whether the observed ions are negatively or
positively charged. This is often important in determining the neutral mass but
it also indicates something about the nature of the molecules.
Different types of ion source result in different arrays of fragments produced
from the original molecules. An electron ionization source produces many
fragments and mostly single-charged (1-) radicals (odd number of electrons),
whereas an electrospray source usually produces non-radical quasimolecular ions
that are frequently multiply charged. Tandem mass spectrometry purposely
produces fragment ions post-source and can drastically change the sort of data
achieved by an experiment.
Knowledge of the origin of a sample can provide insight into the component
molecules of the sample and their fragmentations. A sample from a synthesis/
manufacturing process will probably contain impurities chemically related to
the target component. A crudely prepared biological sample will probably
contain a certain amount of salt, which may form adducts with the analyte
molecules in certain analyses.
Results can also depend heavily on sample preparation and how it was run/
introduced. An important example is the issue of which matrix is used for MALDI
spotting, since much of the energetics of the desorption/ionization event is
controlled by the matrix rather than the laser power. Sometimes samples are
spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather
than a protonated species.
Mass spectrometry can measure molar mass, molecular structure, and sample
purity. Each of these questions requires a different experimental procedure;
therefore, adequate definition of the experimental goal is a prerequisite for
collecting the proper data and successfully interpreting it.
*** Interpretation of mass spectra[edit] ***
Toluene electron ionization mass spectrum
Main article: Mass_spectrum_analysis
Since the precise structure or peptide_sequence of a molecule is deciphered
through the set of fragment masses, the interpretation of mass_spectra requires
combined use of various techniques. Usually the first strategy for identifying
an unknown compound is to compare its experimental mass spectrum against a
library of mass spectra. If no matches result from the search, then manual
interpretation[38] or software_assisted_interpretation_of_mass_spectra must be
performed. Computer simulation of ionization and fragmentation processes
occurring in mass spectrometer is the primary tool for assigning structure or
peptide sequence to a molecule. An a_priori structural information is
fragmented in_silico and the resulting pattern is compared with observed
spectrum. Such simulation is often supported by a fragmentation library[39]
that contains published patterns of known decomposition reactions. Software
taking advantage of this idea has been developed for both small molecules and
proteins.
Analysis of mass spectra can also be spectra with accurate_mass. A mass-to-
charge ratio value (m/z) with only integer precision can represent an immense
number of theoretically possible ion structures; however, more precise mass
figures significantly reduce the number of candidate molecular_formulas. A
computer algorithm called formula generator calculates all molecular formulas
that theoretically fit a given mass with specified tolerance.
A recent technique for structure elucidation in mass spectrometry, called
precursor_ion_fingerprinting, identifies individual pieces of structural
information by conducting a search of the tandem_spectra of the molecule under
investigation against a library of the product-ion_spectra of structurally
characterized precursor ions.[40]
***** Applications[edit] *****

Mass spectrometry has both qualitative and quantitative uses. These include
identifying unknown compounds, determining the isotopic composition of elements
in a molecule, and determining the structure of a compound by observing its
fragmentation. Other uses include quantifying the amount of a compound in a
sample or studying the fundamentals of gas_phase_ion_chemistry (the chemistry
of ions and neutrals in a vacuum). MS is now commonly used in analytical
laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great
variety of compounds.
As an analytical technique it possesses distinct advantages such as: Increased
sensitivity over most other analytical techniques because the analyzer, as a
mass-charge filter, reduces background interference, Excellent specificity from
characteristic fragmentation patterns to identify unknowns or confirm the
presence of suspected compounds, Information about molecular weight,
Information about the isotopic abundance of elements, Temporally resolved
chemical data.
A few of the disadvantages of the method is that it often fails to distinguish
between optical and geometrical isomers and the positions of substituent in o-,
m- and p- positions in an aromatic ring. Also, its scope is limited in
identifying hydrocarbons that produce similar fragmented ions.
**** Isotope ratio MS: isotope dating and tracing[edit] ****
Mass spectrometer to determine the 16O/18O and 12C/13C isotope ratio on
biogenous carbonate
Main article: Isotope-ratio_mass_spectrometry
Mass spectrometry is also used to determine the isotopic composition of
elements within a sample. Differences in mass among isotopes of an element are
very small, and the less abundant isotopes of an element are typically very
rare, so a very sensitive instrument is required. These instruments, sometimes
referred to as isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IR-MS), usually use a single
magnet to bend a beam of ionized particles towards a series of Faraday_cups
which convert particle impacts to electric_current. A fast on-line analysis of
deuterium content of water can be done using flowing_afterglow_mass
spectrometry, FA-MS. Probably the most sensitive and accurate mass spectrometer
for this purpose is the accelerator_mass_spectrometer (AMS). This is because it
provides ultimate sensitivity, capable of measuring individual atoms and
measuring nuclides with a dynamic range of ~1015 relative to the major stable
isotope.[41] Isotope ratios are important markers of a variety of processes.
Some isotope ratios are used to determine the age of materials for example as
in carbon_dating. Labeling with stable isotopes is also used for protein
quantification. (see protein_characterization below)
*** Membrane-introduction mass spectrometry: measuring gases in solution[edit]
***
Membrane-introduction_mass_spectrometry combines the isotope ratio MS with a
reaction chamber/cell separated by a gas-permeable membrane. This method allows
the study of gases as they evolve in solution. This method has been extensively
used for the study of the production of oxygen by Photosystem_II.[42]
**** Trace gas analysis[edit] ****
Several techniques use ions created in a dedicated ion source injected into a
flow tube or a drift tube: selected_ion_flow_tube (SIFT-MS), and proton
transfer_reaction (PTR-MS), are variants of chemical_ionization dedicated for
trace gas analysis of air, breath or liquid headspace using well defined
reaction time allowing calculations of analyte concentrations from the known
reaction kinetics without the need for internal standard or calibration.
**** Atom probe[edit] ****
An atom_probe is an instrument that combines time-of-flight mass spectrometry
and field-evaporation microscopy to map the location of individual atoms.
**** Pharmacokinetics[edit] ****
Main article: Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetics is often studied using mass spectrometry because of the
complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) and the need for high
sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common
instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple_quadrupole_mass
spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added
specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation
of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent
different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized
or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are
important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such
complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the
standard curve; however it is not uncommon to use curve_fitting with more
complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass
spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.[43][44]
[45]
There is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity
mass spectrometry for microdosing studies, which are seen as a promising
alternative to animal_experimentation.
**** Protein characterization[edit] ****
Main article: Protein_mass_spectrometry
Mass spectrometry is an important method for the characterization and
sequencing of proteins. The two primary methods for ionization of whole
proteins are electrospray_ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted_laser
desorption/ionization (MALDI). In keeping with the performance and mass range
of available mass spectrometers, two approaches are used for characterizing
proteins. In the first, intact proteins are ionized by either of the two
techniques described above, and then introduced to a mass analyzer. This
approach is referred to as "top-down" strategy of protein analysis. The top-
down approach however is largely limited to low-throughput single-protein
studies. In the second, proteins are enzymatically digested into smaller
peptides using proteases such as trypsin or pepsin, either in solution or in
gel after electrophoretic separation. Other proteolytic agents are also used.
The collection of peptide products are often separated by chromatography prior
to introduction to the mass analyzer. When the characteristic pattern of
peptides is used for the identification of the protein the method is called
peptide_mass_fingerprinting (PMF), if the identification is performed using the
sequence data determined in tandem_MS analysis it is called de_novo_peptide
sequencing. These procedures of protein analysis are also referred to as the
"bottom-up" approach, and have also been used to analyse the distribution and
position of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation on
proteins. [46] A third approach is also beginning to be used, this intermediate
"middle-down" approach involves analyzing proteolytic peptides that are larger
than the typical tryptic peptide.[47]
**** Space exploration[edit] ****
NASA's Phoenix_Mars_Lander analyzing a soil sample from the "Rosy Red" trench
with the TEGA mass spectrometer
As a standard method for analysis, mass spectrometers have reached other
planets and moons. Two were taken to Mars by the Viking_program. In early 2005
the CassiniâHuygens mission delivered a specialized GC-MS instrument aboard
the Huygens_probe through the atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the
planet Saturn. This instrument analyzed atmospheric samples along its descent
trajectory and was able to vaporize and analyze samples of Titan's frozen,
hydrocarbon covered surface once the probe had landed. These measurements
compare the abundance of isotope(s) of each particle comparatively to earth's
natural abundance.[48] Also on board the CassiniâHuygens spacecraft was an
ion and neutral mass spectrometer which had been taking measurements of Titan's
atmospheric composition as well as the composition of Enceladus' plumes. A
Thermal_and_Evolved_Gas_Analyzer mass spectrometer was carried by the Mars
Phoenix_Lander launched in 2007.[49]
Mass spectrometers are also widely used in space missions to measure the
composition of plasmas. For example, the Cassini spacecraft carried the Cassini
Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS),[50] which measured the mass of ions in Saturn's
magnetosphere.
**** Respired gas monitor[edit] ****
Mass spectrometers were used in hospitals for respiratory gas analysis
beginning around 1975 through the end of the century. Some are probably still
in use but none are currently being manufactured.[51]
Found mostly in the operating_room, they were a part of a complex system, in
which respired gas samples from patients undergoing anesthesia were drawn into
the instrument through a valve mechanism designed to sequentially connect up to
32 rooms to the mass spectrometer. A computer directed all operations of the
system. The data collected from the mass spectrometer was delivered to the
individual rooms for the anesthesiologist to use.
The uniqueness of this magnetic sector mass spectrometer may have been the fact
that a plane of detectors, each purposely positioned to collect all of the ion
species expected to be in the samples, allowed the instrument to simultaneously
report all of the gases respired by the patient. Although the mass range was
limited to slightly over 120 u, fragmentation of some of the heavier molecules
negated the need for a higher detection limit.[52]
**** Preparative mass spectrometry[edit] ****
The primary function of mass spectrometry is as a tool for chemical analyses
based on detection and quantification of ions according to their mass-to-charge
ratio. However, mass spectrometry also shows promise for material synthesis.
[41] Ion soft landing is characterized by deposition of intact species on
surfaces at low kinetic energies which precludes the fragmentation of the
incident species.[53] The soft landing technique was first reported in 1977 for
the reaction of low energy sulfur containing ions on a lead surface.[54]
