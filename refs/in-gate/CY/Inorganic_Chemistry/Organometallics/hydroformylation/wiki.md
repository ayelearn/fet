Hydroformylation of an Alkene (R1 to R3 organyl groups (i. e. Alkyl- or Aryl
group) or hydrogen).
Hydroformylation, also known as oxo synthesis or oxo process, is an industrial
process for the production of aldehydes from alkenes.[1][2] This chemical
reaction entails the net addition of a formyl group (CHO) and a hydrogen atom
to a carbon-carbon double bond. This process has undergone continuous growth
since its invention: Production capacity reached 6.6Ã106 tons in 1995. It is
important because aldehydes are easily converted into many secondary products.
For example, the resulting aldehydes are hydrogenated to alcohols that are
converted to detergents. Hydroformylation is also used in speciality_chemicals,
relevant to the organic_synthesis of fragrances and drugs. The development of
hydroformylation is one of the premier achievements of 20th-century industrial
chemistry.
The process entails treatment of an alkene typically with high pressures
(between 10 and 100 atmospheres) of carbon_monoxide and hydrogen at
temperatures between 40 and 200 Â°C.[3] Transition_metal catalysts are
required. Invariably, the catalyst dissolves in the reaction medium, i.e.
hydroformylation is an example of homogeneous_catalysis.

***** History[edit] *****
The process was discovered by the German chemist Otto_Roelen in 1938 in the
course of investigations of the Fischer-Tropsch_process. Aldehydes and
diethylketone were obtained when ethylene was added to an F-T reactor. Through
these studies, Roelen discovered the utility of cobalt catalysts. HCo(CO)4,
which had been isolated only a few years prior to Roelen's work, was shown to
be an excellent catalyst.[4][5] The term oxo synthesis was coined by the
Ruhrchemie patent department, who expected the process to be applicable to the
preparation of both aldehydes and ketones. Subsequent work demonstrated that
the ligand tributylphosphine (PBu3) improved the selectivity of the cobalt-
catalysed process. The mechanism of Co-catalyzed hydroformylation was
elucidated by Richard_F._Heck and David Breslow in the 1960s.[6]
A generic rhodium catalyst, where PAr3 = triphenylphosphine or its sulfonated
analogue Tppts. See tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium_carbonyl_hydride.
In 1968s, highly active rhodium-based catalysts were reported.[7] Since the
1970s, most hydroformylation relies on catalysts based on rhodium.[8] Water-
soluble catalysts have been developed. They facilitate the separation of the
products from the catalyst.[9]
***** Mechanism[edit] *****
Mechanism of cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation. The process begins with
dissociation of CO from cobalt_tetracarbonyl_hydride to give the 16-electron
species (step 1). Subsequent binding of alkene gives an 18e species (step 2).
In step 3, the olefin inserts to give the 16e alkyl tricarbonyl. Coordination
of another equivalent of CO give alkyl tetracarbonyl (step 4).[6] Migratory
insertion of CO gives the 16e acyl in step 5. In step 6, oxidative addition of
hydrogen gives a dihydrido complex, which in step 7 releases aldehyde by
reductive_elimination.[10] Step 8 is unproductive and reversible.
**** Selectivity[edit] ****
A key consideration of hydroformylation is the "normal" vs. "iso" selectivity.
For example, the hydroformylation of propylene can afford two isomeric
products, butyraldehyde or isobutyraldehyde:
      H2 + CO + CH3CH=CH2 â CH3CH2CH2CHO ("normal")
      vs.
      H2 + CO + CH3CH=CH2 â (CH3)2CHCHO ("iso")
These isomers reflect the regiochemistry of the insertion of the alkene into
the MâH bond. Since both products are not equally desirable(normal is more
stable than iso), much research was dedicated to the quest for catalyst that
favored the normal isomer.
**** Steric effects[edit] ****
Markovnikov's_rule addition of the cobalt hydride to primary alkenes is
disfavored by steric hindrance between the cobalt centre and the secondary
alkyl ligand. Bulky ligands exacerbate this steric hindrance. Hence, the mixed
carbonyl/phosphine complexes offer a greater selectivity for anti-Markovnikov
addition, thus favoring straight chain products (n-) aldehydes.
n (top) vs. iso (bottom)-selectivity.
**** Electronic effects[edit] ****
Additionally, electron-rich the hydride complex are less proton-like. Thus, as
a result, the electronic_effects that normally favour the Markovnikov addition
to an alkene are less applicable. Thus, electron-rich hydrides are more
selective.
**** Acyl formation[edit] ****
To suppress competing isomerization of the alkene, the rate of migatory
insertion of the carbonyl into the carbon-metal bond of the alkyl be fast. The
rate of insertion of the carbonyl carbon into the C-M bond is likely to be
greater than the rate of beta-hydride elimination.[11]
[Hydroformylation_of_2-octene]
***** Asymmetric hydroformylation[edit] *****
Hydroformylation of prochiral alkenes creates new stereocenters. Using chiral
phosphine ligands, the hydroformylation can be tailored to favor one
enantiomer.[12] Thus, for example, dexibuprofen, the (+)â(s)-enantiomer of
ibuprofen, can be produced by enantioselective hydroformylation followed by
oxidation.
***** Processes[edit] *****
The industrial processes vary depending on the chain length of the olefin to be
hydroformylated, the catalyst metal and ligands, and the recovery of the
catalyst. The original Ruhrchemie process produced propanal from ethene and
syngas using cobalt_tetracarbonyl_hydride. Today, industrial processes based on
cobalt catalysts are mainly used for the production of medium- to long-chain
olefins, whereas the rhodium-based catalysts are usually used for the
hydroformylation of propene. The rhodium catalysts are significantly more
expensive than cobalt catalysts. In the hydroformylation of higher molecular
weight olefins the separation of the catalyst from the produced aldehydes is
difficult.
**** BASF-oxo process[edit] ****
The BASF-oxo process starts mostly with higher olefins and relies on cobalt
carbonyl-based catalyst.[13] By conducting the reaction at low temperatures,
one observes increased selectivity favoring the linear product. The process is
carried out at a pressure of about 30 MPa and in a temperature range of 150 to
170 Â°C. The cobalt is recovered from the liquid product by oxidation to water-
soluble Co2 +, followed by the addition of aqueous formic or acetic_acids. This
process gives an aqueous phase of cobalt, which can then recycled. Losses are
compensated by the addition of cobalt salts.[14]
**** Exxon process[edit] ****
The Exxon process, also Kuhlmann- or PCUK â oxo process, is used for the
hydroformylation of C6âC12 olefins. The process relies on cobalt catalysts.
In order to recover the catalyst, an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution or
sodium carbonate is added to the organic phase. By extraction with olefin and
neutralization by addition of sulfuric_acid solution under carbon monoxide
pressure the metal_carbonyl_hydride can recovered. This is stripped out with
syngas, absorbed by the olefin, and returned to the reactor. Similar to the
BASF process, the Exxon process is carried out at a pressure of about 30 MPa
and at a temperature of about 160 to 180 Â°C.[14]
**** Shell process[edit] ****
The Shell process uses cobalt complexes modified with phosphine_ligands for the
hydroformylation of C7âC14 olefins. The resulting aldehydes are directly
hydrogenated to the fatty_alcohols, which are separated by distillation, which
allows the catalyst to be recycled. The process has good selectivity to linear
products, which find use as feedstock for detergents. The process is carried
out at a pressure of about 4 to 8 MPa and at a temperature range of about
150â190 Â°C.[14]
**** Union Carbide process[edit] ****
The Union Carbide (UCC) process, also known as low-pressure oxo process (LPO),
relies on a rhodium catalyst dissolved in high-boiling thick oil, a higher
molecular weight condensation product of the primary aldehydes, for the
hydroformylation of propene. The reaction mixture is separated in a falling
film evaporator from volatile components. The liquid phase is distilled and
butyraldehyde is removed as head product while the catalyst containing bottom
product is recycled to the process. The process is carried out at about 1.8 MPa
and 95â100 Â°C.[14]
**** Ruhrchemie/RhoneâPoulenc process[edit] ****
Process scheme of the Ruhrchemie/RhÃ´neâPoulenc process
The Ruhrchemie/RhoneâPoulenc process (RCRPP) relies on a rhodium catalyst
with water-soluble TPPTS as ligand (Kuntz Cornils catalyst) for the
hydroformylation of propene.[15] The tri-sulfonation of triphenylphosphane
ligand provides hydrophilic properties to the organometallic complex. The
catalyst complex carries nine sulfonate-groups and is highly soluble in water
(about 1 kg Lâ1), but not in the emerging product phase.[16] The water-
soluble TPPTS is used in about 50-fold excess, whereby the leaching of the
catalyst is effectively suppressed. Reactants are propene and syngas consisting
of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a ratio of 1.1:1. A mixture of butyraldehyde
and isobutyraldehyde in the ratio 96:4 is generated with few by-products such
as alcohols, esters and higher boiling fractions.[16] The Ruhrchemie/Rhone-
Poulenc-process is the first commercially available two-phase system in which
the catalyst is present in the aqueous phase. In the progress of the reaction
an organic product phase is formed which is separated continuously by means of
phase separation, wherein the aqueous catalyst phase remains in the reactor.
[16]
The process is carried out in a stirred tank reactor where the olefin and the
syngas are entained from the bottom of the reactor through the catalyst phase
under intensive stirring. The resulting crude aldehyde phase is separated at
the top from the aqueous phase. The aqueous catalyst-containing solution is re-
heated via a heat exchanger and pumped back into the reactor.[16] The excess
olefin and syngas is separated from the aldehyde phase in a stripper and fed
back to the reactor. The generated heat is used for the generation of process
steam, which is used for subsequent distillation of the organic phase to
separate into butyraldehyde and isobutyraldehyde.[16] Potential catalyst
poisons coming from the synthesis gas migrate into the organic phase and
removed from the reaction with the aldehyde. Thus there is no accumulation of
catalyst poisons, and the elaborate fine purification of the syngas can be
omitted.[16]
A plant was built in Oberhausen in 1984, which was debottlenecked in 1988 and
again in 1998 up to a production capacity of 500,000 t/a butanal. The
conversion rate of propene is 98% and the selectivity to n-butanal is high.
During the life time of a catalyst batch in the process less than 1 ppb rhodium
is lost.[17]
**** Laboratory process[edit] ****
Recipes have been developed for the hydroformylation on a laboratory scale,
e.g. of cyclohexene.[3][12]
***** Other substrates[edit] *****
Cobalt_carbonyl and rhodium complexes catalyse the hydroformylation of
formaldehyde and ethylene_oxide to give 2-hydroxyacetaldehyde and 3-
hydroxypropanaldehyde, which can then be hydrogenated to ethylene_glycol and
1,3-propanediol, respectively. The reactions work best when the solvent is
basic (such as pyridine).[18][19]
In the case of dicobalt_octacarbonyl or Co2(CO)8 as a catalyst, 3-pentanone can
arise from ethylene and CO, in the absence of hydrogen. A proposed intermediate
is the ethylene-propionyl species [CH3C(O)Co(CO)3(ethylene)] which undergoes a
migratory_insertion to form [CH3COCH2CH2Co(CO)3]. The required hydrogen arises
from the water_shift_reaction. For details, see[20]
If the water shift reaction is not operative, the reaction affords a polymer
containing alternating carbon monoxide and ethylene units. Such aliphatic
polyketones are more conventionally prepared using palladium catalysts.[21]
Functionalized olefins such as allyl_alcohol can be hydroformylated. The target
product 1,4-butanediol and its isomer is obtained with isomerization free
catalysts such as rhodium-triphenylphosphine complexes. The use of the cobalt
complex leads by isomerization of the double bond to n-propanal.[22] The
hydroformylation of alkenyl ethers and alkenyl esters occurs usually in the Î±-
position to the ether or ester function.
The hydroformylation of acrylic_acid and methacrylic_acid leads in the rhodium-
catalyzed process in the first step to the Markovnikov_product.[23] By
variation of the reaction conditions the reaction can be directed to different
products. A high reaction temperature and low carbon monoxide pressure favors
the isomerization of the Markovnikov product to the thermodynamically more
stable Î²-isomer, which leads to the n-aldehyde. Low temperatures and high
carbon monoxide pressure and an excess of phosphine, which blocks free
coordination sites, can lead to faster hydroformylation in the Î±-position to
the ester group and suppress the isomerization.[23]
***** Side- and consecutive reactions[edit] *****
**** Olefins[edit] ****
Side reactions of the olefins are the isomerization and hydrogenation of the
olefinic double bond. While the alkanes resulting from hydrogenation of the
double bond do not participate further in the reaction, the isomerization of
the double bond with subsequent formation of the n-alkyl complexes is a desired
reaction. The hydrogenation is usually of minor importance; However, Cobalt-
phosphine-modified catalysts can have an increased hydrogenation activity,
where up to 15% of the olefin is hydrogenated.
**** Aldehydes[edit] ****
A usually desired consecutive reaction is the hydrogenation of the aldehydes to
alcohols. Higher temperatures and hydrogen partial pressures favor the
hydrogenation of the resulting aldehyde to the alcohol. For the reaction
mechanism it is believed that the aldehyde initially forms a CO-Ï-complex with
the catalyst. This is rearranged to the alkoxide complex and by subsequent
oxidative addition of hydrogen the alcohol is eliminated and the starting
complex is formed.
The aldehydic carbon-oxygen double bond can also be subject to
hydroformylation, which leads to formic acid and its esters. The reaction
requires the carbon monoxide insertion into the oxygen-metal bond of the
alkoxide complex. The resulting Formyl complex can converted into the formic
acid esters and the starting complex by oxidative addition of hydrogen. The
initially produced aldehydes can react further by aldol condensation to either
target product precursors like 2-ethylhexene-al or higher molecular weight
condensation products, so-called thick oil.
**** Catalyst and ligands[edit] ****
The triphenylphosphine complexes are under reaction conditions potentially
subject to hydrogenation and can release benzene. The insertion of carbon
monoxide in an intermediate metal-phenyl bond can lead to the formation of
benzaldehyde or by subsequent hydrogenation to benzyl_alcohol.[24] One of the
ligands phenyl-groups can be replaced by propene, and the resulting
diphenylpropylphosphine ligand can inhibit the hydroformylation reaction due to
its increased basicity.[24]
Trace impurities of the starting materials with oxygen or sulfur and their
compounds can contribute to the oxidation of phosphorus (III) â to phosphorus
(V) compounds or lead to catalytically inactive metal_oxides and â sulfides.
