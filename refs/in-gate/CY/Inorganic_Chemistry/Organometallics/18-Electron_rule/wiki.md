****** 18-electron rule ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The 18-electron rule is a rule used primarily for predicting and rationalizing
formulas for stable metal complexes, especially organometallic_compounds.[1]
The rule is based on the fact that the valence_shells of transition_metals
consist of nine valence orbitals (one s_orbital, three p_orbitals and five d
orbitals), which collectively can accommodate 18 electrons as either bonding or
nonbonding electron pairs. This means that, the combination of these nine
atomic_orbitals with ligand orbitals creates nine molecular_orbitals that are
either metal-ligand bonding or non-bonding. When a metal complex has 18 valence
electrons, it is said to have achieved the same electron configuration as the
noble_gas in the period. The rule and its exceptions are similar to the
application of the octet_rule to main group elements. The rule is not helpful
for complexes of metals that are not transition metals, and interesting or
useful transition metal complexes will violate the rule because of the
consequences deviating from the rule bears on reactivity. The rule was first
proposed by American chemist Irving_Langmuir in 1921.[1][2]

***** Applicability[edit] *****
The rule usefully predicts the formulas for low-spin_complexes of the Cr, Mn,
Fe, and Co triads. Well-known examples include ferrocene, iron_pentacarbonyl,
chromium_carbonyl, and nickel_carbonyl.
Ligands in a complex determine the applicability of the 18-electron rule. In
general, complexes that obey the rule are composed at least partly of Ï-
acceptor_ligands (also known as Ï-acids). This kind of ligand exerts a  very
strong ligand_field, which lowers the energies of the resultant molecular
orbitals so that they are favorably occupied. Typical ligands include olefins,
phosphines, and CO. Complexes of Ï-acids typically feature metal in a low-
oxidation state. The relationship between oxidation state and the nature of the
ligands is rationalized within the framework of Ï_backbonding.
**** Consequences for reactivity[edit] ****
Compounds that obey the 18-electron rule are typically "exchange inert".
Examples include [Co(NH3)6]Cl3, Mo(CO)6, and [Fe(CN)6]4â. In such cases, in
general ligand exchange occurs via dissociative_substitution mechanisms,
wherein the rate of reaction is determined by the rate of dissociation of a
ligand. On the other hand, 18-electron compounds can be highly reactive toward
electrophiles such as protons, and such reactions are associative in mechanism,
being acid-base reactions.
Complexes with fewer than 18 valence electrons tend to show enhanced
reactivity. Thus, the 18-electron rule is often a recipe for non-reactivity in
either a stoichiometric or a catalytic sense.
**** Duodectet rule[edit] ****
Current computational findings suggest valence p-orbitals on the metal
participate in metal-ligand bonding, albeit weakly.[3] Some new theoretical
treatments do not count the metal p-orbitals in metal-ligand bonding,[4]
although these orbitals are still included as polarization_functions. This
results in a duodectet (12-electron) rule for one s-orbital and five d-orbitals
only, but the modified rule has yet to be adopted by the general chemistry
community.
***** Exceptions[edit] *****
Ï-donor or Ï-donor ligands with small interactions with the metal orbitals
lead to a weak ligand_field which increases the energies of t2g orbitals. These
molecular_orbitals become non-bonding or weakly anti-bonding orbitals (small
Îoct). Therefore, addition or removal of electron has little effect on complex
stability. In this case, there is no restriction on the number of d-electrons
and complexes with 12â22 electrons are possible. Small Îoct makes filling
eg* possible (>18 eâ) and Ï-donor ligands can make t2g antibonding
(<18 eâ). These types of ligand are located in the low-to-medium part of the
spectrochemical series. For example: [TiF6]2â (Ti(IV), d0, 12 eâ), [Co
(NH3)6]3+ (Co(III), d6, 18 eâ), [Cu(OH2)6]2+ (Cu(II), d9, 21 eâ).
In terms of metal ions, Îoct increases down a group as well as with increasing
oxidation_number. Strong ligand fields lead to low-spin complexes which cause
some exceptions to the 18-electron rule.
**** 16-electron complexes[edit] ****
An important class of complexes that violate the 18e rule are the 16-electron
complexes with metal d8 configurations. All high-spin d8 metal ions are
octahedral (or tetrahedral), but the low-spin d8 metal ions are all square
planar. Important examples of square-planar low-spin d8 metal Ions are Rh(I),
Ir(I), Ni(II), Pd(II), and Pt(II). At picture below is shown the splitting of
the d subshell in low-spin square-planar complexes. Examples are especially
prevalent for derivatives of the cobalt and nickel triads. Such compounds are
typically square-planar. The most famous example is Vaska's_complex (IrCl(CO)
(PPh3)2), [PtCl4]2â, and Zeise's_salt [PtCl3(Î·2-C2H4)]â. In such
complexes, the dz2 orbital is doubly occupied and nonbonding.
      [Chem507f09sqvstet2.png]
Many catalytic_cycles operate via complexes that alternate between 18-electron
and square-planar 16-electron configurations. Examples include Monsanto_acetic
acid_synthesis, hydrogenations, hydroformylations, olefin isomerizations, and
some alkene polymerizations.
Other violations can be classified according to the kinds of ligands on the
metal center.
**** Bulky ligands[edit] ****
Bulky ligands can preclude the approach of the full complement of ligands that
would allow the metal to achieve the 18 electron configuration. Examples:
    * Ti(neopentyl)4 (8 eâ)
    * Cp*2Ti(C2H4) (16 eâ)
    * V(CO)6 (17 eâ)
    * Cp*Cr(CO)3 (17 eâ)
    * Pt(P
      tBu
      3)2 (14 eâ)
    * Co(norbornyl)4 (13 eâ)
    * [FeCp2]+ (17 eâ)
Sometimes such complexes engage in agostic_interactions with the hydrocarbon
framework of the bulky ligand. For example:
    * W(CO)3[P(C6H11)3]2 has 16 eâ but has a short bonding contact between
      one CâH bond and the W center.
    * Cp(PMe3)V(CHCMe3) (14 eâ, diamagnetic) has a short VâH bond with the
      'alkylidene-H', so the description of the compound is somewhere between
      Cp(PMe3)V(CHCMe3) and Cp(PMe3)V(H)(CCMe3).
**** High-spin complexes[edit] ****
High-spin metal complexes have singly occupied orbitals and may not have any
empty orbitals into which ligands could donate electron density. In general,
there are few or no Ï-acidic ligands in the complex. These singly occupied
orbitals can combine with the singly occupied orbitals of radical ligands
(e.g., oxygen), or addition of a strong_field ligand can cause electron-
pairing, thus creating a vacant orbital that it can donate into. Examples:
    * CrCl3(THF)3 (15 eâ)
    * [Mn(H2O)6]2+ (17 eâ)
    * [Cu(H2O)6]2+ (21 eâ, see comments below)
Complexes containing strongly Ï-donating ligands often violate the 18-electron
rule. These ligands include fluoride (Fâ), oxide (O2â), nitride (N3â),
alkoxides (ROâ), and imides (RN2â). Examples:
    * [CrO4]2â (16 eâ)
    * Mo(=NR)2Cl2 (12 eâ)
In the latter case, there is substantial donation of the nitrogen lone pairs to
the Mo (so the compound could also be described as a 16 eâ compound). This
can be seen from the short MoâN bond length, and from the angle MoâNâC
(R), which is nearly 180Â°. Counter-examples:
    * trans-WO2(Me2PCH2CH2PMe2)2 (18 eâ)
    * Cp*ReO3 (18 eâ)
In these cases, the M=O bonds are "pure" double bonds (i.e., no donation of the
lone pairs of the oxygen to the metal), as reflected in the relatively long
bond distances.
**** Ï-donating ligands[edit] ****
Ligands where the coordinating atom bear nonbonding lone pairs often stabilize
unsaturated complexes. Metal amides and alkoxides often violate the 18e rule.
**** Combinations of effects[edit] ****
The above factors can sometimes combine. Examples include
    * Cp*VOCl2 (14 eâ)
    * TiCl4 (8 eâ)
**** Higher electron counts[edit] ****
Some complexes have more than 18 electrons. Examples:
    * Cobaltocene (19 eâ)
    * Nickelocene (20 eâ)
    * The hexaaquacopper(II) ion [Cu(H2O)6]2+ (21 eâ)
    * TM(CO)8â (TM = Sc, Y, La) (20 eâ)
Often, cases where complexes have more than 18 valence electrons are attributed
to electrostatic forces â the metal attracts ligands to itself to try to
counterbalance its positive charge, and the number of electrons it ends up with
is unimportant. In the case of the metallocenes, the chelating nature of the
cyclopentadienyl ligand stabilizes its bonding to the metal. Somewhat
satisfying are the two following observations: cobaltocene is a strong electron
donor, readily forming the 18-electron cobaltocenium cation; and nickelocene
tends to react with substrates to give 18-electron complexes, e.g. CpNiCl(PR3)
and free CpH.
In the case of nickelocene, the extra two electrons are in orbitals which are
weakly metal-carbon antibonding; this is why it often participates in reactions
where the MâC bonds are broken and the electron count of the metal changes to
18.[5]
The 20-electron systems TM(CO)8â (TM = Sc, Y, La) have a cubic (Oh)
equilibrium geometry and a singlet (1A1g) electronic ground state. There is one
occupied valence MO with a2u symmetry, which is formed only by ligand orbitals
without a contribution from the metal AOs. But the adducts TM(CO)8â (TM=Sc,
Y, La) fulfill the 18-electron rule when one considers only those valence
electrons, which occupy metalâligand bonding orbitals.[6]
