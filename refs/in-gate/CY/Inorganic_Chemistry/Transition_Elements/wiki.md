In chemistry, the term transition metal (or transition element) has three
possible meanings:
    * The IUPAC definition[1] defines a transition metal as "an element whose
      atom has a partially filled d sub-shell, or which can give rise to
      cations with an incomplete d sub-shell".
    * Many scientists describe a "transition metal" as any element in the d-
      block of the periodic_table, which includes groups 3 to 12 on the
      periodic table.[2][3] In actual practice, the f-block lanthanide and
      actinide series are also considered transition metals and are called
      "inner transition metals".
    * Cotton and Wilkinson[4] expand the brief IUPAC definition (see above) by
      specifying which elements are included. As well as the elements of groups
      4 to 11, they add scandium and yttrium in group 3, which have a partially
      filled d subshell in the metallic_state. Lanthanum and actinium in group
      3 are, however, classified as lanthanides and actinides respectively.
English chemist Charles Bury (1890â1968) first used the word transition in
this context in 1921, when he referred to a transition series of elements
during the change of an inner layer of electrons (for example n = 3 in the 4th
row of the periodic table) from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to
32.[5][6][7] These elements are now known as the d-block.

The elements of groups 4â11 are generally recognized as transition metals,
justified by their typical chemistry, i.e. a large range of complex ions in
various oxidation states, colored complexes, and catalytic properties either as
the element or as ions (or both). Sc and Y in group 3 are also generally
recognized as transition metals. However, the elements LaâLu and AcâLr and
group 12 attract different definitions from different authors.
   1. Many chemistry textbooks and printed periodic tables classify La and Ac
      as group 3 elements and transition metals, since their atomic ground-
      state configurations are s2d1 like Sc and Y. The elements CeâLu are
      considered as the "lanthanide" series (or "lanthanoid" according to
      IUPAC) and ThâLr as the "actinide" series.[8][9] The two series
      together are classified as f-block elements, or (in older sources) as
      "inner transition elements".
   2. Some inorganic chemistry textbooks include La with the lanthanides and Ac
      with the actinides.[4][10][11] This classification is based on
      similarities in chemical behaviour and defines 15 elements in each of the
      two series, even though they correspond to the filling of an f subshell,
      which can only contain 14 electrons.
   3. A third classification defines the f-block elements as LaâYb and
      AcâNo, while placing Lu and Lr in group 3.[5] This is based on the
      Aufbau_principle (or Madelung rule) for filling electron subshells, in
      which 4f is filled before 5d (and 5f before 6d), so that the f subshell
      is actually full at Yb (and No), while Lu (and Lr) has an [ ]s2f14d1
      configuration. However La and Ac are exceptions to the Aufbau principle
      with electron configuration [ ]s2d1 (not [ ]s2f1 as the Aufbau principle
      predicts), so it is not clear from atomic electron configurations whether
      La or Lu (Ac or Lr) should be considered as transition metals.[12]
Zinc, cadmium, and mercury are generally excluded from the transition metals,
[5] as they have the electronic_configuration [ ]d10s2, with no incomplete d
shell.[13] In the oxidation_state +2 the ions have the electronic configuration
[ ]â¦d10. However, these elements can exist in other oxidation states,
including the +1 oxidation state, as in the diatomic ion Hg2+
2. The group 12 elements Zn, Cd and Hg may therefore, under certain criteria,
be classed as post-transition_metals in this case. However, it is often
convenient to include these elements in a discussion of the transition
elements. For example, when discussing the crystal_field_stabilization_energy
of first-row transition elements, it is convenient to also include the elements
calcium and zinc, as both Ca2+
 and Zn2+
 have a value of zero, against which the value for other transition metal ions
may be compared. Another example occurs in the IrvingâWilliams_series of
stability constants of complexes.
The recent (though disputed and so far not reproduced independently) synthesis
of mercury(IV)_fluoride (HgF
4) has been taken by some to reinforce the view that the group 12 elements
should be considered transition metals,[14] but some authors still consider
this compound to be exceptional.[15]
Although meitnerium, darmstadtium, and roentgenium are within the d-block and
are expected to behave as transition metals analogous to their lighter
congeners iridium, platinum, and gold, this has not yet been experimentally
confirmed.
**** Subclasses[edit] ****
Early transition metals are on the left side of the periodic table from group 3
to group 7. Late transition metals are on the right side of the d-block, from
group 8 to 11 (and 12 if it is counted as transition metals).
***** Electronic configuration[edit] *****
The general electronic configuration of the d-block elements is [Inert gas]
(n â 1)d1â10n s0â2. The period 6 and 7 transition metals also add
(n â 2)f0â14 electrons, which are omitted from the tables below.
The Madelung rule predicts that the typical electronic_structure of transition
metal atoms can be written as [inert gas]ns2(n â 1)dm where the inner d
orbital is predicted to be filled after the valence-shell's s orbital is
filled. This rule is however only approximate â it only holds for some of the
transition elements, and only then in their neutral ground state.
The d-sub-shell is the next-to-last sub-shell and is denoted as     ( n
&#x2212; 1 ) d   {\displaystyle (n-1)d}  [{\displaystyle (n-1)d}]-sub-shell.
The number of s electrons in the outermost s sub-shell is generally one or two
except palladium (Pd), with no electron in that s-sub shell in its ground
state. The s-sub-shell in the valence shell is represented as the ns sub-shell,
e.g. 4s. In the periodic table, the transition metals are present in eight
groups (4 to 11), with some authors including some elements in groups 3 or 12.
The elements in group 3 have an ns2(n â 1)d1 configuration. The first
transition series is present in the 4th period, and starts after Ca (Z = 20) of
group-2 with the configuration [Ar]4s2, or scandium (Sc), the first element of
group 3 with atomic number Z = 21 and configuration [Ar]4s23d1, depending on
the definition used. As we move from left to right, electrons are added to the
same d-sub-shell till it is complete. The element of group 11 in the first
transition series is copper (Cu) with an atypical configuration [Ar]4s13d10.
Despite the filled d subshell in metallic copper it nevertheless forms a stable
ion with an incomplete d subshell. Since the electrons added fill the     ( n
&#x2212; 1 ) d   {\displaystyle (n-1)d}  [{\displaystyle (n-1)d}] orbitals, the
properties of the d-block elements are quite different from those of s and p
block elements in which the filling occurs either in s or in p-orbitals of the
valence shell. The electronic configuration of the individual elements present
in all the d-block series are given below:[16]

configuration
A careful look at the electronic configuration of the elements reveals that
there are certain exceptions, for example Cr and Cu. These are either because
of the symmetry or nuclear-electron and electron-electron force.
The     ( n &#x2212; 1 ) d   {\displaystyle (n-1)d}  [{\displaystyle (n-1)d}]
orbitals that are involved in the transition metals are very significant
because they influence such properties as magnetic character, variable
oxidation states, formation of colored compounds etc. The valence     s ( n s )
{\displaystyle s(ns)}  [{\displaystyle s(ns)}] and     p ( n p )
{\displaystyle p(np)}  [{\displaystyle p(np)}] orbitals have very little
contribution in this regard since they hardly change in the moving from left to
the right in a transition series. In transition metals, there is a greater
horizontal similarities in the properties of the elements in a period in
comparison to the periods in which the d-orbitals are not involved. This is
because in a transition series, the valence shell electronic configuration of
the elements do not change. However, there are some group similarities as well.
***** Characteristic properties[edit] *****
There are a number of properties shared by the transition elements that are not
found in other elements, which results from the partially filled d shell. These
include
    * the formation of compounds whose color is due to dâd electronic
      transitions
    * the formation of compounds in many oxidation states, due to the
      relatively low energy gap between different possible oxidation states[17]
    * the formation of many paramagnetic compounds due to the presence of
      unpaired d electrons. A few compounds of main group elements are also
      paramagnetic (e.g. nitric_oxide, oxygen)
Most transition metals can be bound to a variety of ligands, allowing for a
wide variety of transition metal complexes.[18]

Colour in transition-series metal compounds is generally due to electronic
transitions of two principal types.
    * charge_transfer transitions. An electron may jump from a predominantly
      ligand orbital to a predominantly metal orbital, giving rise to a ligand-
      to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transition. These can most easily occur
      when the metal is in a high oxidation state. For example, the colour of
      chromate, dichromate and permanganate ions is due to LMCT transitions.
      Another example is that mercuric_iodide, HgI2, is red because of a LMCT
      transition.
A metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition will be most likely when
the metal is in a low oxidation state and the ligand is easily reduced.
In general charge transfer transitions result in more intense colours than d-
d transitions.
    * d-d transitions. An electron jumps from one d-orbital to another. In
      complexes of the transition metals the d orbitals do not all have the
      same energy. The pattern of splitting of the d orbitals can be calculated
      using crystal_field theory. The extent of the splitting depends on the
      particular metal, its oxidation state and the nature of the ligands. The
      actual energy levels are shown on TanabeâSugano_diagrams.
In centrosymmetric complexes, such as octahedral complexes, d-d transitions are
forbidden by the Laporte_rule and only occur because of vibronic_coupling in
which a molecular_vibration occurs together with a d-d transition. Tetrahedral
complexes have somewhat more intense colour because mixing d and p orbitals is
possible when there is no centre of symmetry, so transitions are not pure d-
d transitions. The molar_absorptivity (Îµ) of bands caused by d-d transitions
are relatively low, roughly in the range 5-500 Mâ1cmâ1 (where M = mol
dmâ3).[19] Some d-d transitions are spin_forbidden. An example occurs in
octahedral, high-spin complexes of manganese(II), which has a d5 configuration
in which all five electron has parallel spins; the colour of such complexes is
much weaker than in complexes with spin-allowed transitions. Many compounds of
manganese(II) appear almost colourless. The
spectrum_of_[Mn(H
2O)
6]2+
 shows a maximum molar absorptivity of about 0.04 Mâ1cmâ1 in the visible
spectrum.
**** Oxidation states[edit] ****
A characteristic of transition metals is that they exhibit two or more
oxidation_states, usually differing by one. For example, compounds of vanadium
are known in all oxidation states between â1, such as [V(CO)
6]â
, and +5, such as VO3â
4.
Main_group_elements in groups 13 to 18 also exhibit multiple oxidation states.
The "common" oxidation states of these elements typically differ by two. For
example, compounds of gallium in oxidation states +1 and +3 exist in which
there is a single gallium atom. No compound of Ga(II) is known: any such
compound would have an unpaired electron and would behave as a free_radical and
be destroyed rapidly. The only compounds in which gallium has a formal
oxidation state of +2 are dimeric compounds, such as [Ga
2Cl
6]2â
, which contain a Ga-Ga bond formed from the unpaired electron on each Ga atom.
[20] Thus the main difference in oxidation states, between transition elements
and other elements is that oxidation states are known in which there is a
single atom of the element and one or more unpaired electrons.
The maximum oxidation state in the first row transition metals is equal to the
number of valence electrons from titanium (+4) up to manganese (+7), but
decreases in the later elements. In the second row the maximum occurs with
ruthenium (+8), and in the third row, the maximum occurs with iridium (+9). In
compounds such as [MnO
4]â
 and OsO
4 the elements achieve a stable configuration by covalent_bonding.
The lowest oxidation states are exhibited in metal_carbonyl complexes such as
Cr(CO)
6 (oxidation state zero) and [Fe(CO)
4]2â
 (oxidation state â2) in which the 18-electron_rule is obeyed. These
complexes are also covalent.
Ionic compounds are mostly formed with oxidation states +2 and +3. In aqueous
solution the ions are hydrated by (usually) six water molecules arranged
octahedrally.
**** Magnetism[edit] ****
Main article: Magnetochemistry
Transition metal compounds are paramagnetic when they have one or more unpaired
d electrons.[21] In octahedral complexes with between four and seven d
electrons both high_spin and low_spin states are possible. Tetrahedral
transition metal complexes such as [FeCl
4]2â
 are high_spin because the crystal field splitting is small so that the energy
to be gained by virtue of the electrons being in lower energy orbitals is
always less than the energy needed to pair up the spins. Some compounds are
diamagnetic. These include octahedral, low-spin, d6 and square-planar d8
complexes. In these cases, crystal_field splitting is such that all the
electrons are paired up.
Ferromagnetism occurs when individual atoms are paramagnetic and the spin
vectors are aligned parallel to each other in a crystalline material. Metallic
iron and the alloy alnico are examples of ferromagnetic materials involving
transition metals. Anti-ferromagnetism is another example of a magnetic
property arising from a particular alignment of individual spins in the solid
state.
**** Catalytic properties[edit] ****
The transition metals and their compounds are known for their homogeneous and
heterogeneous catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to
adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in
the contact_process), finely divided iron (in the Haber_process), and nickel
(in catalytic_hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid
surface (nanomaterial-based_catalysts) involve the formation of bonds between
reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row
transition metals utilize 3d and 4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect
of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and
also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is
lowered). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation
states, they become more effective as catalysts.
An interesting type of catalysis occurs when the products of a reaction
catalyse the reaction producing more catalyst (autocatalysis). One example is
the reaction of oxalic_acid with acidified potassium_permanganate (or manganate
(VII)).[22] Once a little Mn2+ has been produced, it can react with MnO4â
forming Mn3+. This then reacts with C2O4â ions forming Mn2+ again.
**** Physical properties[edit] ****
As implied by the name, all transition metals are metals and thus conductors of
electricity.
In general, transition metals possess a high density and high melting_points
and boiling_points. These properties are due to metallic_bonding by delocalized
d electrons, leading to cohesion which increases with the number of shared
electrons. However the group 12 metals have much lower melting and boiling
points since their full d subshells prevent dâd bonding, which again tends to
differentiate them from the accepted transition metals. Mercury has a melting
point of â38.83 Â°C (â37.89 Â°F) and is a liquid at room temperature.
