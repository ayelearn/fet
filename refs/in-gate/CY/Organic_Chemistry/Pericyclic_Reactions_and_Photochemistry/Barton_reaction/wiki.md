From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The Barton reaction, also known as the Barton nitrite ester reaction, is a
photochemical reaction that involves the photolysis of an alkyl nitrite to form
a Î´-nitroso alcohol.
Discovered in 1960, the reaction is named for its discoverer, Nobel Laureate
Sir Derek_Barton.[1] Barton's Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry in 1969 was awarded for
his work on understanding conformations of organic molecules, work which was
key to realizing the utility of the Barton Reaction.[2]
The Barton reaction involves a homolytic ROâNO cleavage, followed by Î´-
hydrogen_abstraction, free_radical recombination, and tautomerization to form
an oxime.[3] Selectivity for the Î´-hydrogen is a result of the conformation of
the 6-membered radical intermediate. Often, the site of hydrogen atom
abstraction can be easily predicted. This allows the regio- and stereo-
selective introduction of functionality into complicated molecules with high
yield. Due to its then unique ability to derivitize otherwise inert substrates
Barton used this reaction extensively in the 1960s to create a number of
unnatural steroid analogues.[4]
While the Barton reaction has not enjoyed the popularity or widespread use of
many other organic reactions, together with the mechanistically similar
HofmannâLÃ¶ffler_reaction it represents one of the first examples of C-
H_activation chemistry, a field which is now the topic of much frontline
research in industrial and academic chemistry circles.[5]

***** Preparation of alkyl nitrites[edit] *****
The unusual alkyl nitrite starting material of the Barton reaction is prepared
by attack of an alcohol on a nitrosylium cation generated in situ by
dehydration of doubly protonated nitrous acid.[6] This series of steps is
mechanistically identical to the first half of the mechanism formation of the
more well-known aryl and alkyl diazonium_salts.
While the synthesis of alkyl nitrites from nitrosyl_chloride is known and oft-
employed in the context of complex molecule synthesis, the reaction is
reversible and the products are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the starting
material. Furthermore, nitrosyl chloride is a powerful oxidizing agent, and
oxidation of the alcohols with concomitant chlorination has been observed.[7]
The reaction of nitrosyl chloride with aromatic alcohols generally yields
nitroso compounds and other over-oxidation products.
***** Reaction mechanism and regioselectivity[edit] *****
The Barton reaction commences with a photochemically induced cleavage of the
nitrite O-N bond, typically using a high pressure mercury lamp.[8] This
produces an alkyoxyl radical which immediately abstracts a hydrogen atom from
the Î´-carbon. In the absence of other radical sources or other proximal
reactive groups, the alkyl radical recombines with the nitrosyl radical. The
resultant nitroso compounds undergoes tautomerization to the isolated oxime
product.
The carbon centered radical can be intercepted by other radical sources such as
iodine or acrylonitrile. The first instance results in the Î´-hydrogen being
replaced with iodine, then subsequent cyclization to a tetrahydrofuran by an
SN2_reaction.[9] The second example results in a chain elongation product with
the oxime formed 2 carbon units further from the oxygen than normal.[10]
This mechanistic hypothesis is supported by kinetic_isotope_effect experiments.
[11] Isotopic labeling of the nitrite with 15N has shown the mechanism non-
âcagedâ and that the nitrosyl radical formed from a given nitrite
recombines randomly with other alkyl radicals. However, recombination of the
nitrosyl radical with the alkoxyl radical (a reversal of the homolytic
cleavage) has been shown to proceed without scrambling of isotope labels.[12]
This lack of tight radical pairing is also supported by the observation that
alkyl radicals generated by Barton conditions can undergo radical cyclization
while analogous intermediates generated by lead_tetraacetate oxidation do not.
[13]
In rare cases, it appears that the alkoxyl radical may epimerize before
hydrogen atom abstraction.[14]
Most commonIy, including steroidal systems, the hydrogen atom is abstracted
from a methyl group that has a 1,3 diaxial relationship with the alkoxyl
radical.[15] In the absence of a hydrogen on the Î´-carbon, or when the
particular conformation of the substrate orients the Îµ-carbon close together,
1,6-hydrogen atom transfer is the favored process. However, these reactions
tend to be an order of magnitude slower than the corresponding 1,5-hydrogen
atom transfer.
Computational studies have shown that this preference for 1,5-hydrogen atom
transfer over 1,6-hydrogen atom transfer appears to be entropically favored
rather than a result of a particular stable âchair-likeâ transition state.
[16] In fact, it has been calculated that the 1,6-hydrogen atom transfer
proceeds through a transition that is about 0.8 kcal/mol lower than that of the
1,5.
In acyclic systems, Î´-hydrogen abstraction is still observed, however, alpha-
hydrogen abstraction to form the corresponding ketone competes.[17]
In certain cases, particularly nitrites derived from cyclopentyl alcohols, the
oxygen-centered radical prefers to react via C-C bond cleavage as opposed to H-
atom abstraction.[9] For example, when subjected to Barton conditions,
cyclopentyl nitrite forms glutaraldehyde monoxime. This is also observed in
cases where the radical intermediate formed by fragmentation is particularly
stable, such as the allylic radical formed by the fragmentation of isopulegol
nitrite.[18]
***** Variants[edit] *****
In rigid systems such as aldosterone, the 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer is
exceedingly fast, with a rate constant on the order of 10^7 s-1. Similar
intermolecular H-atom transfer can be up to 100 times slower.[19] Furthermore,
the hydrogen atom transfer benefits from the formation of a stronger O-H bond
at the expense of a weaker C-H bond. For the formation of a primary, second, or
tertiary alkyl radical from an alkoxyl radical, there is a driving force of 3
kcal/mol, 5 kcal/mol, and 9 kcal/mol, respectively.[15]
The alkyl radical formed after hydrogen atom transfer is susceptible to
standard radical reactions when scavengers are present in sufficient excess to
outcompete the nitrosyl radical. Soon after their initial disclosure, Barton
and co-workers reported the trapping of the radical with I2 and CCl3Br (as
Iodine and Bromine radical sources, respectively) to form the Î´-halo-alcohol.
These halohydrin species can be cyclized to the corresponding tetrahydropyran
derivates under basic conditions.[20]
Large excesses of activated alkenes can be used to intercept the alkyl radical
and results in formation of a C-C bond from an unactivated C-H bond.[21]
In the presence of oxygen, the alkyl radical is trapped and forms an organic
peroxy radical. This intermiediate is trapped by the nitrosyl radical and then
isomerizes to give a Î´-nitrate ester which, while both acid- and base-stable,
can be reduced to the corresponding alcohol under mild conditions.[22]
***** Applications in complex molecule synthesis[edit] *****
**** Aldosterone acetate[edit] ****
In a publication immediately proceeding Bartonâs initial disclosure of the
methodology in the Journal_of_the_American_Chemical_Society, a synthesis of
aldosterone acetate is demonstrated.[23] Allowing corticosterone acetate to
react with nitrosyl chloride in dry pyridine yields the nitrite. Subsequently,
irradiation under inert atmosphere followed by treatment with aqueous sodium
nitrite selectively gives the desired oxime. The oxime is then acetylated and
hydrolyzed to yield the natural product hemiacetal.
**** Perhydrohistrionicotoxin[edit] ****
After a short synthesis to obtain the desired spiro-[5.4] system, Nobel
Laureaute E.J._Corey and co-workers employed a Barton reaction to selectively
introduce an oxime in a 1,3-diaxial position to the nitrite ester. The oxime is
converted to a lactam via a Beckmann_rearrangement and then reduced to the
natural product.[24]
[A_Barton_reaction_in_the_synthesis_of_perhydrohistrionicotoxin]
**** Azadiradione[edit] ****
Corey again employed the Barton reaction in the synthesis of Azadiradione, a
member of the limonoid family of natural products. In this case,
nitrosylsulfuric_acid is used in place of nitrosyl chloride.[25]
[A_Barton_reaction_in_the_synthesis_of_azadiradione]
**** Allobetulin derivatives[edit] ****
In the process of preparing a series of derivatives of the triterpenoid
allobetulin, Dehan and coworkers observed a remarkable transformation resulting
from two consecutive 1,5-hydrogen atom transfers. While the product of the
single 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer was also observed, the former transformation
represent a formal 1,7-hydrogen atom transfer across an enormous distance.[26]
