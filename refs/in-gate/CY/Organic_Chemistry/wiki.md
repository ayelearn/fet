Methane, CH4; the line-angle structural formula shows four carbon-hydrogen
single bonds (Ï, in black), and the typical 3D shape of tetrahedral molecules,
with ~109Â° interior bond_angles (in dashed-green).
Organic chemistry is a subdiscipline of chemistry that studies the structure,
properties and reactions of organic_compounds, which contain carbon in covalent
bonding.[1] Study of structure determines their chemical_composition and
formula. Study of properties includes physical and chemical_properties, and
evaluation of chemical_reactivity to understand their behavior. The study of
organic_reactions includes the chemical_synthesis of natural_products, drugs,
and polymers, and study of individual organic molecules in the laboratory and
via theoretical (in_silico) study.
The range of chemicals studied in organic chemistry includes hydrocarbons
(compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen) as well as compounds based on
carbon, but also containing other elements,[1][2][3] especially oxygen,
nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus (included in many biochemicals) and the halogens.
Organometallic_chemistry is the study of compounds containing carbonâmetal
bonds.
In addition, contemporary research focuses on organic chemistry involving other
organometallics including the lanthanides, but especially the transition_metals
zinc, copper, palladium, nickel, cobalt, titanium and chromium.

carbon atoms are implied at every terminus of a line and vertex of multiple
lines, and hydrogen atoms are implied to fill the remaining needed valences (up
to 4).
Organic compounds form the basis of all earthly_life and constitute the
majority of known chemicals. The bonding patterns of carbon, with its valence
of fourâformal single, double, and triple bonds, plus structures with
delocalized electronsâmake the array of organic compounds structurally
diverse, and their range of applications enormous. They form the basis of, or
are constituents of, many commercial products including pharmaceuticals;
petrochemicals and agrichemicals, and products made from them including
lubricants, solvents; plastics; fuels and explosives. The study of organic
chemistry overlaps organometallic_chemistry and biochemistry, but also with
medicinal_chemistry, polymer_chemistry, and materials_science.[1]

***** History *****
Main article: History_of_chemistry
Friedrich_WÃ¶hler
Before the nineteenth century, chemists generally believed that compounds
obtained from living organisms were endowed with a vital force that
distinguished them from inorganic_compounds. According to the concept of
vitalism (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a "vital force".
[4] During the first half of the nineteenth century, some of the first
systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816 Michel
Chevreul started a study of soaps made from various fats and alkalis. He
separated the different acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced
the soap. Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it
was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally
come from organic sources), producing new compounds, without "vital force". In
1828 Friedrich_WÃ¶hler produced the organic chemical urea (carbamide), a
constituent of urine, from inorganic starting materials (the salts potassium
cyanate and ammonium_sulfate), in what is now called the WÃ¶hler_synthesis.
Although WÃ¶hler himself was cautious about claiming he had disproved vitalism,
this was the first time a substance thought to be organic was synthesized in
the laboratory without biological (organic) starting materials. The event is
now generally accepted as indeed disproving the doctrine of vitalism.[5]
In 1856 William_Henry_Perkin, while trying to manufacture quinine accidentally
produced the organic dye now known as Perkin's_mauve. His discovery, made
widely known through its financial success, greatly increased interest in
organic chemistry.[6]
A crucial breakthrough for organic chemistry was the concept of chemical
structure, developed independently in 1858 by both Friedrich_August_KekulÃ© and
Archibald_Scott_Couper.[7] Both researchers suggested that tetravalent carbon
atoms could link to each other to form a carbon lattice, and that the detailed
patterns of atomic bonding could be discerned by skillful interpretations of
appropriate chemical reactions.[8]
The era of the pharmaceutical industry began in the last decade of the 19th
century when the manufacturing of acetylsalicylic acidâmore commonly referred
to as aspirinâin Germany was started by Bayer.[9] By 1910 Paul Ehrlich and
his laboratory group began developing arsenic-based arsphenamine, (Salvarsan),
as the first effective medicinal treatment of syphilis, and thereby initiated
the medical practice of chemotherapy. Ehrlich popularized the concepts of
"magic bullet" drugs and of systematically improving drug therapies.[10][11]
His laboratory made decisive contributions to developing antiserum for
diphtheria and standardizing therapeutic serums.[12]
An example of an organometallic molecule, a catalyst called Grubbs'_catalyst.
Its formula is often given as RuCl2(PCy3)2(=CHPh), where the ball-and-stick
model is based on X-ray_crystallography.[13] The single metal atom ruthenium
(Ru), (in turquoise), is at the very center of the structure; two chlorines
(green), are bonded to the ruthenium atomâcarbon atoms are black, hydrogens
gray-white, and phosphorus orange. A phosphorus-ligand bond, tricyclohexyl
phosphine, PCy, is below center; (another PCy ligand appears at the top of the
image where its rings are obscuring one another). The ring group projecting to
the right, an alkylidene, contains a metal-carbon double bond to ruthenium.
Early examples of organic reactions and applications were often found because
of a combination of luck and preparation for unexpected observations. The
latter half of the 19th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic
compounds. The development of synthetic indigo is illustrative. The production
of indigo from plant sources dropped from 19,000 tons in 1897 to 1,000 tons by
1914 thanks to the synthetic methods developed by Adolf_von_Baeyer. In 2002,
17,000 tons of synthetic indigo were produced from petrochemicals.[14]
In the early part of the 20th century, polymers and enzymes were shown to be
large organic molecules, and petroleum was shown to be of biological origin.
The multiple-step synthesis of complex organic compounds is called total
synthesis. Total_synthesis of complex natural compounds increased in complexity
to glucose and terpineol. For example, cholesterol-related compounds have
opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified
derivatives. Since the start of the 20th century, complexity of total syntheses
has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as lysergic
acid and vitamin_B12.[15]
The total_synthesis of vitamin B12 marked a major achievement in organic
chemistry.
The discovery of petroleum and the development of the petrochemical_industry
spurred the development of organic chemistry. Converting individual petroleum
compounds into different types of compounds by various chemical processes led
to organic_reactions enabling a broad range of industrial and commercial
products including, among (many) others: plastics, synthetic_rubber, organic
adhesives, and various property-modifying petroleum additives and catalysts.
The majority of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms are in
fact carbon compounds, so the association between organic chemistry and
biochemistry is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a
branch of organic chemistry. Although the history_of_biochemistry might be
taken to span some four centuries, fundamental understanding of the field only
began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term biochemistry was
coined around the start of 20th century. Research in the field increased
throughout the twentieth century, without any indication of slackening in the
rate of increase, as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing
services such as BIOSIS_Previews and Biological_Abstracts, which began in the
1920s as a single annual volume, but has grown so drastically that by the end
of the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online
electronic database.[16]
***** Characterization *****
Since organic compounds often exist as mixtures, a variety of techniques have
also been developed to assess purity, especially important being chromatography
techniques such as HPLC and gas_chromatography. Traditional methods of
separation include distillation, crystallization, and solvent_extraction.
Organic compounds were traditionally characterized by a variety of chemical
tests, called "wet methods", but such tests have been largely displaced by
spectroscopic or other computer-intensive methods of analysis.[17] Listed in
approximate order of utility, the chief analytical methods are:
    * Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_(NMR)_spectroscopy is the most commonly used
      technique, often permitting complete assignment of atom connectivity and
      even stereochemistry using correlation_spectroscopy. The principal
      constituent atoms of organic chemistry â hydrogen and carbon â exist
      naturally with NMR-responsive isotopes, respectively 1H and 13C.
    * Elemental_analysis: A destructive method used to determine the elemental
      composition of a molecule. See also mass spectrometry, below.
    * Mass_spectrometry indicates the molecular_weight of a compound and, from
      the fragmentation_patterns, its structure. High resolution mass
      spectrometry can usually identify the exact formula of a compound and is
      used in lieu of elemental analysis. In former times, mass spectrometry
      was restricted to neutral molecules exhibiting some volatility, but
      advanced ionization techniques allow one to obtain the "mass spec" of
      virtually any organic compound.
    * Crystallography can be useful for determining molecular_geometry when a
      single crystal of the material is available. Highly efficient hardware
      and software allows a structure to be determined within hours of
      obtaining a suitable crystal.
Traditional spectroscopic methods such as infrared_spectroscopy, optical
rotation, and UV/VIS_spectroscopy provide relatively nonspecific structural
information but remain in use for specific classes of compounds. Traditionally
refractive index and density were also important for substance identification.
***** Properties *****
Physical properties of organic compounds typically of interest include both
quantitative and qualitative features. Quantitative information includes
melting point, boiling point, and index of refraction. Qualitative properties
include odor, consistency, solubility, and color.
**** Melting and boiling properties ****
Organic compounds typically melt and many boil. In contrast, while inorganic
materials generally can be melted, many do not boil, tending instead to
degrade. In earlier times, the melting point (m.p.) and boiling point (b.p.)
provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds.
The melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and
their molecular weight. Some organic compounds, especially symmetrical ones,
sublime, that is they evaporate without melting. A well-known example of a
sublimable organic compound is para-dichlorobenzene, the odiferous constituent
of modern mothballs. Organic compounds are usually not very stable at
temperatures above 300 Â°C, although some exceptions exist.
**** Solubility ****
Neutral organic compounds tend to be hydrophobic; that is, they are less
soluble in water than in organic solvents. Exceptions include organic compounds
that contain ionizable (which can be converted in ions) groups as well as low
molecular_weight alcohols, amines, and carboxylic_acids where hydrogen_bonding
occurs. Organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic solvents. Solvents can be
either pure substances like ether or ethyl_alcohol, or mixtures, such as the
paraffinic solvents such as the various petroleum_ethers and white_spirits, or
the range of pure or mixed aromatic solvents obtained from petroleum or tar
fractions by physical separation or by chemical conversion. Solubility in the
different solvents depends upon the solvent type and on the functional_groups
if present in the solution.
**** Solid state properties ****
Various specialized properties of molecular_crystals and organic_polymers with
conjugated_systems are of interest depending on applications, e.g. thermo-
mechanical and electro-mechanical such as piezoelectricity, electrical
conductivity (see conductive_polymers and organic_semiconductors), and electro-
optical (e.g. non-linear_optics) properties. For historical reasons, such
properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of polymer_science and
materials_science.
***** Nomenclature *****
Main article: IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry
Various names and depictions for one organic compound.
The names of organic compounds are either systematic, following logically from
a set of rules, or nonsystematic, following various traditions. Systematic
nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from IUPAC. Systematic
nomenclature starts with the name for a parent_structure within the molecule of
interest. This parent name is then modified by prefixes, suffixes, and numbers
to unambiguously convey the structure. Given that millions of organic compounds
are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome. Thus, IUPAC
recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex
molecules. To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names
of the parent structures. Parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons,
heterocycles, and monofunctionalized derivatives thereof.
Nonsystematic nomenclature is simpler and unambiguous, at least to organic
chemists. Nonsystematic names do not indicate the structure of the compound.
They are common for complex molecules, which includes most natural products.
Thus, the informally named lysergic_acid_diethylamide is systematically named
(6aR,9R)-N,N-diethyl-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo-[4,3-fg] quinoline-
9-carboxamide.
With the increased use of computing, other naming methods have evolved that are
intended to be interpreted by machines. Two popular formats are SMILES and
InChI.
**** Structural drawings ****
Organic molecules are described more commonly by drawings or structural
formulas, combinations of drawings and chemical symbols. The line-angle_formula
is simple and unambiguous. In this system, the endpoints and intersections of
each line represent one carbon, and hydrogen atoms can either be notated
explicitly or assumed to be present as implied by tetravalent carbon.
[Structural_representations_of_butane]
**** History ****
By 1880 an explosion in the number of chemical compounds being discovered
occurred assisted by new synthetic and analytical techniques. Grignard
described the situation as "chaos le plus complet" as due to the lack of
convention it was possible to have multiple names for the same compound. This
led to the creation of the Geneva_rules in 1892.[18]
***** Classification of organic compounds *****
**** Functional groups ****
Main article: Functional_group
The family of carboxylic acids contains a carboxyl (-COOH) functional_group.
Acetic_acid, shown here, is an example.
The concept of functional groups is central in organic chemistry, both as a
means to classify structures and for predicting properties. A functional group
is a molecular module, and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed,
within limits, to be the same in a variety of molecules. Functional groups can
have decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic
compounds. Molecules are classified on the basis of their functional groups.
Alcohols, for example, all have the subunit C-O-H. All alcohols tend to be
somewhat hydrophilic, usually form esters, and usually can be converted to the
corresponding halides. Most functional groups feature heteroatoms (atoms other
than C and H). Organic compounds are classified according to functional groups,
alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, etc.[19]
**** Aliphatic compounds ****
Main article: Aliphatic_compound
The aliphatic hydrocarbons are subdivided into three groups of homologous
series according to their state of saturation:
    * alkanes (paraffins): aliphatic hydrocarbons without any double or triple
      bonds, i.e. just C-C, C-H single bonds
    * alkenes (olefins): aliphatic hydrocarbons which contain one or more
      double bonds, i.e. di-olefins (dienes) or poly-olefins.
    * alkynes (acetylenes): aliphatic hydrocarbons which have one or more
      triple bonds.
The rest of the group is classed according to the functional groups present.
Such compounds can be "straight-chain", branched-chain or cyclic. The degree of
branching affects characteristics, such as the octane_number or cetane_number
in petroleum chemistry.
Both saturated (alicyclic) compounds and unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic
derivatives. The most stable rings contain five or six carbon atoms, but large
rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane
family is the three-membered cyclopropane ((CH2)3). Saturated cyclic compounds
contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or
conjugated) double bond. Cycloalkanes do not contain multiple bonds, whereas
the cycloalkenes and the cycloalkynes do.
**** Aromatic compounds ****
Benzene is one of the best-known aromatic compounds as it is one of the
simplest and most stable aromatics.
Aromatic hydrocarbons contain conjugated double bonds. This means that every
carbon atom in the ring is sp2 hybridized, allowing for added stability. The
most important example is benzene, the structure of which was formulated by
KekulÃ© who first proposed the delocalization or resonance principle for
explaining its structure. For "conventional" cyclic compounds, aromaticity is
conferred by the presence of 4n + 2 delocalized pi electrons, where n is an
integer. Particular instability (antiaromaticity) is conferred by the presence
of 4n conjugated pi electrons.
**** Heterocyclic compounds ****
Main article: Heterocyclic_compound
The characteristics of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if heteroatoms
are present, which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the
ring (exocyclic) or as a member of the ring itself (endocyclic). In the case of
the latter, the ring is termed a heterocycle. Pyridine and furan are examples
of aromatic heterocycles while piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are the
corresponding alicyclic heterocycles. The heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules
is generally oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, with the latter being particularly
common in biochemical systems.
Heterocycles are commonly found in a wide range of products including aniline
dyes and medicines. Additionally, they are prevalent in a wide range of
biochemical compounds such as alkaloids, vitamins, steroids, and nucleic acids
(e.g. DNA, RNA).
Rings can fuse with other rings on an edge to give polycyclic_compounds. The
purine nucleoside bases are notable polycyclic aromatic heterocycles. Rings can
also fuse on a "corner" such that one atom (almost always carbon) has two bonds
going to one ring and two to another. Such compounds are termed spiro and are
important in a number of natural_products.
**** Polymers ****
Main article: Polymer
This swimming board is made of polystyrene, an example of a polymer.
One important property of carbon is that it readily forms chains, or networks,
that are linked by carbon-carbon (carbon-to-carbon) bonds. The linking process
is called polymerization, while the chains, or networks, are called polymers.
The source compound is called a monomer.
Two main groups of polymers exist: synthetic_polymers and biopolymers.
Synthetic polymers are artificially manufactured, and are commonly referred to
as industrial_polymers.[20] Biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural
environment, or without human intervention.
Since the invention of the first synthetic polymer product, bakelite, synthetic
polymer products have frequently been invented.[citation_needed]
Common synthetic organic polymers are polyethylene (polythene), polypropylene,
nylon, teflon (PTFE), polystyrene, polyesters, polymethylmethacrylate (called
perspex and plexiglas), and polyvinylchloride (PVC).[citation_needed]
Both synthetic and natural rubber are polymers.[citation_needed]
Varieties of each synthetic polymer product may exist, for purposes of a
specific use. Changing the conditions of polymerization alters the chemical
composition of the product and its properties. These alterations include the
chain_length, or branching, or the tacticity.[citation_needed]
With a single monomer as a start, the product is a homopolymer.[citation
needed]
Secondary component(s) may be added to create a heteropolymer (co-polymer) and
the degree of clustering of the different components can also be controlled.
[citation_needed]
Physical characteristics, such as hardness, density, mechanical or tensile
strength, abrasion resistance, heat resistance, transparency, colour, etc. will
depend on the final composition.[citation_needed]
**** Biomolecules ****
Maitotoxin, a complex organic biological toxin.
Biomolecular_chemistry is a major category within organic chemistry which is
frequently studied by biochemists. Many complex multi-functional group
molecules are important in living organisms. Some are long-chain biopolymers,
and these include peptides, DNA, RNA and the polysaccharides such as starches
in animals and celluloses in plants. The other main classes are amino_acids
(monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), carbohydrates (which
includes the polysaccharides), the nucleic_acids (which include DNA and RNA as
polymers), and the lipids. In addition, animal biochemistry contains many small
molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the Krebs
cycle, and produces isoprene, the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes
in animals form the important steroid structural (cholesterol) and steroid
hormone compounds; and in plants form terpenes, terpenoids, some alkaloids, and
a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the latex
of various species of plants, which is the basis for making rubber.

**** Small molecules ****
Molecular models of caffeine.
In pharmacology, an important group of organic compounds is small_molecules,
also referred to as 'small organic compounds'. In this context, a small
molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active, but is not a
polymer. In practice, small molecules have a molar_mass less than approximately
1000 g/mol.
**** Fullerenes ****
Fullerenes and carbon_nanotubes, carbon compounds with spheroidal and tubular
structures, have stimulated much research into the related field of materials
science. The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Sir Harold W. Kroto of
the United Kingdom and by Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl, Jr., of the
United States. Using a laser to vaporize graphite rods in an atmosphere of
helium gas, these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules
composed of 60 carbon atoms (C60) joined together by single and double bonds to
form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal facesâa design that
resembles a football, or soccer ball. In 1996 the trio was awarded the Nobel
Prize for their pioneering efforts. The C60 molecule was named
buckminsterfullerene (or, more simply, the buckyball) after the American
architect R. Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same
structural principles.
**** Others ****
Organic compounds containing bonds of carbon to nitrogen, oxygen and the
halogens are not normally grouped separately. Others are sometimes put into
major groups within organic chemistry and discussed under titles such as
organosulfur_chemistry, organometallic_chemistry, organophosphorus_chemistry
and organosilicon_chemistry.
***** Organic reactions *****
Organic_reactions are chemical_reactions involving organic_compounds. Many of
these reactions are associated with functional groups. The general theory of
these reactions involves careful analysis of such properties as the electron
affinity of key atoms, bond_strengths and steric_hindrance. These factors can
determine the relative stability of short-lived reactive_intermediates, which
usually directly determine the path of the reaction.
The basic reaction types are: addition reactions, elimination reactions,
substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions and redox
reactions. An example of a common reaction is a substitution_reaction written
as:
      Nuâ + C-X â C-Nu + Xâ
where X is some functional_group and Nu is a nucleophile.
The number of possible organic reactions is basically infinite. However,
certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common
or useful reactions. Each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that
explains how it happens in sequenceâalthough the detailed description of
steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone.
The stepwise course of any given reaction mechanism can be represented using
arrow_pushing techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement
of electrons as starting materials transition through intermediates to final
products.
***** Organic synthesis *****
See also: Chemical_synthesis and Organic_synthesis
A synthesis designed by E.J._Corey for oseltamivir (Tamiflu). This synthesis
has 11 distinct reactions.
Synthetic organic chemistry is an applied_science as it borders engineering,
the "design, analysis, and/or construction of works for practical purposes".
Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem solving task, where a
synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from
optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps
that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by
utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example,
a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an
enolate, or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol
reaction. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the
actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel
synthetic routes for complex molecules is called total_synthesis.
Strategies to design a synthesis include retrosynthesis, popularized by E.J.
Corey, which starts with the target molecule and splices it to pieces according
to known reactions. The pieces, or the proposed precursors, receive the same
treatment, until available and ideally inexpensive starting materials are
reached. Then, the retrosynthesis is written in the opposite direction to give
the synthesis. A "synthetic tree" can be constructed, because each compound and
also each precursor has multiple syntheses.
