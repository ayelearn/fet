The structure of a DNA molecule is essential to its function.
Structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a
material object or system, or the object or system so organized.[1] Material
structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural
objects such as biological_organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract
structures include data_structures in computer_science and musical_form. Types
of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a
network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections
between components that are neighbors in space.

***** Load-bearing[edit] *****

Buildings, aircraft, skeletons, anthills, beaver dams and salt domes are all
examples of load-bearing structures. The results of construction are divided
into buildings and non-building_structures, and make up the infrastructure of a
human society. Built structures are broadly divided by their varying design
approaches and standards, into categories including building structures,
architectural_structures, civil engineering structures and mechanical
structures.
The effects of loads on physical structures are determined through structural
analysis, which is one of the tasks of structural_engineering. The structural
elements can be classified as one-dimensional (ropes, struts, beams, arches),
two-dimensional (membranes, plates, slab, shells, vaults), or three-dimensional
(solid masses).[2]:2 The latter was the main option available to early
structures such as Chichen_Itza. A one-dimensional element has one dimension
much larger than the other two, so the other dimensions can be neglected in
calculations; however, the ratio of the smaller dimensions and the composition
can determine the flexural and compressive stiffness of the element. Two-
dimensional elements with a thin third dimension have little of either but can
resist biaxial traction.[2]:2â3
The structure elements are combined in structural systems. The majority of
everyday load-bearing structures are section-active structures like frames,
which are primarily composed of one-dimensional (bending) structures. Other
types are Vector-active structures such as trusses, surface-active structures
such as shells and folded plates, form-active structures such as cable or
membrane structures, and hybrid structures.[3]:134â136
Load-bearing biological structures such as bones, teeth, shells, and tendons
derive their strength from a multilevel hierarchy of structures employing
biominerals and proteins, at the bottom of which are collagen_fibrils.[4]
***** Biological[edit] *****

Main article: Biological_organisation
In biology, structures exist at all levels of organization, ranging
hierarchically from the atomic and molecular to the cellular, tissue, organ,
organismic, population and ecosystem level. Usually, a higher-level structure
is composed of multiple copies of a lower-level structure.
Structural_biology is concerned with the biomolecular_structure of
macromolecules, particularly proteins and nucleic_acids.[5] The function of
these molecules is determined by their shape as well as their composition, and
their structure has multiple levels. Protein_structure has a four-level
hierarchy. The primary_structure is the sequence of amino_acids that make it
up. It has a peptide backbone made up of a repeated sequence of a nitrogen and
two carbon atoms. The secondary_structure consists of repeated patterns
determined by hydrogen_bonding. The two basic types are the Î±-helix and the
Î²-pleated_sheet. The tertiary_structure is a back and forth bending of the
polypeptide chain, and the quaternary_structure is the way that tertiary units
come together and interact.[6]
***** Chemical[edit] *****
Main article: Chemical_structure
A skeletal formula for dopamine
Chemical structure refers to both molecular geometry and electronic structure.
The structure can be represented by a variety of diagrams called structural
formulas. Lewis_structures use a dot notation to represent the valence
electrons for an atom; these are the electrons that determine the role of the
atom in chemical reactions.[7]:71â72 Bonds between atoms can be represented
by lines with one line for each pair of electrons that is shared. In a
simplified version of such a diagram, called a skeletal_formula, only carbon-
carbon bonds and functional groups are shown.[8]
Atoms in a crystal have a structure that involves repetition of a basic unit
called a unit cell. The atoms can be modeled as points on a lattice, and one
can explore the effect of symmetry operations that include rotations about a
point, reflections about a symmetry planes, and translations (movements of all
the points by the same amount). Each crystal has a finite group, called the
space_group, of such operations that map it onto itself; there are 230 possible
space groups.[9]:125â126 By Neumann's_law, the symmetry of a crystal
determines what physical properties, including piezoelectricity and
ferromagnetism, the crystal can have.[10]:34â36,91â92,168â169
***** Mathematical[edit] *****

***** Musical[edit] *****
See also: Musical_form

A large part of numerical_analysis involves identifying and interpreting the
structure of musical works. Structure can be found at the level of part of a
work, the entire work, or a group of works.[11] Elements of music such as
pitch, duration and timbre combine into small elements like motifs and phrases,
and these in turn combine in larger structures. Not all music (for example,
that of John_Cage) has a hierarchical_organization, but hierarchy makes it
easier for a listener to understand and remember the music.[12]:80
In analogy to linguistic terminology, motifs and phrases can be combined to
make complete musical ideas such as sentences and phrases.[13][14] A larger
form is known as the period. One such form that was widely used between 1600
and 1900 has two phrases, an antecedent and a consequent, with a half cadence
in the middle and a full cadence at the end providing punctuation.[15]:38â39
On a larger scale are single-movement forms such as the sonata_form and the
contrapuntal_form, and multi-movement forms such as the symphony.[12]
***** Social[edit] *****
Main article: Social_structure
A social structure is a pattern of relationships. They are social organizations
of individuals in various life situations. Structures are applicable to people
in how a society is as a system organized by a characteristic pattern of
relationships. This is known as the social organization of the group.
Sociologists have studied the changing structure of these groups. Structure_and
agency are two confronted theories about human behaviour. The debate
surrounding the influence of structure and agency on human thought is one of
the central issues in sociology. In this context, agency refers to the
individual human capacity to act independently and make free choices. Structure
here refers to factors such as social_class, religion, gender, ethnicity,
customs, etc. that seem to limit or influence individual opportunities.
***** Data[edit] *****
Main article: Data_structure
In a singly linked list, each element has a data value and a pointer to the
next element.
In computer_science, a data structure is a way of organizing information in a
computer so that it can be used efficiently.[16] Data structures are built out
of two basic types: An array has an index that can be used for immediate access
to any data item, but depending on the programming_language used, its size must
be specified when it is initialized. A linked_list can be reorganized, grown or
shrunk, but its elements must be accessed with a pointer that links them
together in a particular order.[17]:156 Out of these any number of other data
structures can be created such as stacks, queues, trees and hash_tables.[18]
[19]
In solving a problem, a data structure is generally an integral part of the
algorithm.[20]:5 In modern programming style, algorithms and data structures
are encapsulated together in an abstract data_type.[20]:ix
***** Software[edit] *****
Main article: Software_architecture
In software architecture, the structure of software is the way in which it is
partitioned into interrelated components. A key structural issue is minimizing
dependencies between these components. This makes it possible to change one
component without requiring changes in others.[21]:3 The structure can be
represented in diagrams such as the Control_Structure_Diagram and the
NassiâShneiderman_diagram.[22] Structural elements reflect the requirements
of the application: for example, if the system requires a high fault tolerance,
then a redundant structure is needed so that if a component fails it has
backups.[23] A high redundancy is an essential part of the design of several
systems in the Space_Shuttle.[24]
***** Logical[edit] *****
As a branch of philosophy, logic is concerned with distinguishing good
arguments from poor ones. A chief concern is with the structure of arguments.
[25] An argument consists of one or more premises from which a conclusion is
inferred.[26] The steps in this inference can be expressed in a formal way and
their structure analyzed. Two basic types of inference are deduction and
induction. In a valid deduction, the conclusion necessarily follows from the
premises, regardless of whether they are true or not. An invalid deduction
contains some error in the analysis. An inductive argument claims that if the
premises are true, the conclusion is likely.[26]
