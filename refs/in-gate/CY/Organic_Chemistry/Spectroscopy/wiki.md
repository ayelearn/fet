Analysis of white light by dispersing it with a prism is an example of
spectroscopy.
Spectroscopy /spÉkËtrÉskÉpi/ is the study of the interaction between matter
and electromagnetic radiation (or via electron_spectroscopy, atomic
spectroscopy, etc).[1][2] Historically, spectroscopy originated through the
study of visible_light dispersed according to its wavelength, by a prism. Later
the concept was expanded greatly to include any interaction with radiative
energy as a function of its wavelength or frequency, predominantly in the
electromagnetic_spectrum, though matter_waves and acoustic_waves can also be
considered forms of radiative energy; recently, with tremendous difficulty,
even gravitational_waves have been associated with a spectral signature in the
context of the Laser_Interferometer_Gravitational-Wave_Observatory (LIGO) and
laser interferometry. Spectroscopic data are often represented by an emission
spectrum, a plot of the response of interest as a function of wavelength or
frequency.
Spectroscopy, primarily in the electromagnetic spectrum, is a fundamental
exploratory tool in the fields of physics, chemistry, and astronomy, allowing
the composition, physical structure and electronic structure of matter to be
investigated at atomic scale, molecular scale, macro scale, and over
astronomical distances. Important applications arise from biomedical
spectroscopy in the areas of tissue analysis and medical_imaging.

Spectroscopy and spectrography are terms used to refer to the measurement of
radiation intensity as a function of wavelength and are often used to describe
experimental spectroscopic methods. Spectral measurement devices are referred
to as spectrometers, spectrophotometers, spectrographs or spectral_analyzers.
Daily observations of color can be related to spectroscopy. Neon_lighting is a
direct application of atomic_spectroscopy. Neon and other noble_gases have
characteristic emission frequencies (colors). Neon lamps use collision of
electrons with the gas to excite these emissions. Inks, dyes and paints include
chemical compounds selected for their spectral characteristics in order to
generate specific colors and hues. A commonly encountered molecular_spectrum is
that of nitrogen_dioxide. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a characteristic red
absorption feature, and this gives air polluted with nitrogen dioxide a
reddish-brown color. Rayleigh_scattering is a spectroscopic scattering
phenomenon that accounts for the color of the sky.
Spectroscopic studies were central to the development of quantum_mechanics and
included Max_Planck's explanation of blackbody_radiation, Albert_Einstein's
explanation of the photoelectric_effect and Niels_Bohr's explanation of atomic
structure and spectra. Spectroscopy is used in physical and analytical
chemistry because atoms and molecules have unique spectra. As a result, these
spectra can be used to detect, identify and quantify information about the
atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is also used in astronomy and remote_sensing
on Earth. Most research telescopes have spectrographs. The measured spectra are
used to determine the chemical composition and physical_properties of
astronomical_objects (such as their temperature and velocity).

One of the central concepts in spectroscopy is a resonance and its
corresponding resonant frequency. Resonances were first characterized in
mechanical systems such as pendulums. Mechanical systems that vibrate or
oscillate will experience large amplitude oscillations when they are driven at
their resonant frequency. A plot of amplitude vs. excitation frequency will
have a peak centered at the resonance frequency. This plot is one type of
spectrum, with the peak often referred to as a spectral_line, and most spectral
lines have a similar appearance.
In quantum mechanical systems, the analogous resonance is a coupling of two
quantum mechanical stationary_states of one system, such as an atom, via an
oscillatory source of energy such as a photon. The coupling of the two states
is strongest when the energy of the source matches the energy difference
between the two states. The energy     ( E )   {\displaystyle (E)}  [(E)] of a
photon is related to its frequency     ( &#x03BD; )   {\displaystyle (\nu )}  [
(\nu )] by     E = h &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle E=h\nu }  [E=h\nu ] where     h
{\displaystyle h}  [h] is Planck's_constant, and so a spectrum of the system
response vs. photon frequency will peak at the resonant frequency or energy.
Particles such as electrons and neutrons have a comparable relationship, the de
Broglie_relations, between their kinetic energy and their wavelength and
frequency and therefore can also excite resonant interactions.
Spectra of atoms and molecules often consist of a series of spectral lines,
each one representing a resonance between two different quantum states. The
explanation of these series, and the spectral patterns associated with them,
were one of the experimental enigmas that drove the development and acceptance
of quantum mechanics. The hydrogen_spectral_series in particular was first
successfully explained by the Rutherford-Bohr_quantum_model of the hydrogen
atom. In some cases spectral lines are well separated and distinguishable, but
spectral lines can also overlap and appear to be a single transition if the
density_of_energy_states is high enough. Named series of lines include the
principal, sharp, diffuse and fundamental_series.
***** Classification of methods[edit] *****
A huge diffraction grating at the heart of the ultra-precise ESPRESSO
spectrograph.[3]
Spectroscopy is a sufficiently broad field that many sub-disciplines exist,
each with numerous implementations of specific spectroscopic techniques. The
various implementations and techniques can be classified in several ways.

The types of spectroscopy are distinguished by the type of radiative energy
involved in the interaction. In many applications, the spectrum is determined
by measuring changes in the intensity or frequency of this energy. The types of
radiative energy studied include:
    * Electromagnetic_radiation was the first source of energy used for
      spectroscopic studies. Techniques that employ electromagnetic radiation
      are typically classified by the wavelength region of the spectrum and
      include microwave, terahertz, infrared, near-infrared, ultraviolet-
      visible, x-ray, and gamma spectroscopy.
    * Particles, because of their de_Broglie_waves, can also be a source of
      radiative energy. Both electron and neutron spectroscopy are commonly
      used. For a particle, its kinetic_energy determines its wavelength.
    * Acoustic_spectroscopy involves radiated pressure waves.
    * Dynamic_mechanical_analysis can be employed to impart radiating energy,
      similar to acoustic waves, to solid materials.
**** Nature of the interaction[edit] ****
The types of spectroscopy also can be distinguished by the nature of the
interaction between the energy and the material. These interactions include:[1]
    * Absorption_spectroscopy: Absorption occurs when energy from the radiative
      source is absorbed by the material. Absorption is often determined by
      measuring the fraction of energy transmitted through the material, with
      absorption decreasing the transmitted portion.
    * Emission_spectroscopy: Emission indicates that radiative energy is
      released by the material. A material's blackbody_spectrum is a
      spontaneous emission spectrum determined by its temperature. This feature
      can be measured in the infrared by instruments such as the atmospheric
      emitted radiance interferometer.[4] Emission can also be induced by other
      sources of energy such as flames or sparks or electromagnetic radiation
      in the case of fluorescence.
    * Elastic_scattering and reflection spectroscopy determine how incident
      radiation is reflected or scattered by a material. Crystallography
      employs the scattering of high energy radiation, such as x-rays and
      electrons, to examine the arrangement of atoms in proteins and solid
      crystals.
    * Impedance_spectroscopy: Impedance is the ability of a medium to impede or
      slow the transmittance of energy. For optical applications, this is
      characterized by the index_of_refraction.
    * Inelastic_scattering phenomena involve an exchange of energy between the
      radiation and the matter that shifts the wavelength of the scattered
      radiation. These include Raman and Compton scattering.
    * Coherent or resonance spectroscopy are techniques where the radiative
      energy couples two quantum states of the material in a coherent
      interaction that is sustained by the radiating field. The coherence can
      be disrupted by other interactions, such as particle collisions and
      energy transfer, and so often require high intensity radiation to be
      sustained. Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_(NMR)_spectroscopy is a widely used
      resonance method, and ultrafast_laser_spectroscopy is also possible in
      the infrared and visible spectral regions.

Spectroscopic studies are designed so that the radiant energy interacts with
specific types of matter.
*** Atoms[edit] ***
Atomic_spectroscopy was the first application of spectroscopy developed. Atomic
absorption_spectroscopy and atomic_emission_spectroscopy involve visible and
ultraviolet light. These absorptions and emissions, often referred to as atomic
spectral lines, are due to electronic_transitions of outer shell electrons as
they rise and fall from one electron orbit to another. Atoms also have distinct
x-ray spectra that are attributable to the excitation of inner shell electrons
to excited states.
Atoms of different elements have distinct spectra and therefore atomic
spectroscopy allows for the identification and quantitation of a sample's
elemental composition. After inventing the spectroscope, Robert_Bunsen and
Gustav_Kirchhoff discovered new elements by observing their emission spectra.
Atomic absorption lines are observed in the solar spectrum and referred to as
Fraunhofer_lines after their discoverer. A comprehensive explanation of the
hydrogen_spectrum was an early success of quantum mechanics and explained the
Lamb_shift observed in the hydrogen spectrum, which further led to the
development of quantum_electrodynamics.
Modern implementations of atomic spectroscopy for studying visible and
ultraviolet transitions include flame_emission_spectroscopy, inductively
coupled_plasma_atomic_emission_spectroscopy, glow_discharge_spectroscopy,
microwave_induced_plasma spectroscopy, and spark or arc emission spectroscopy.
Techniques for studying x-ray spectra include X-ray_spectroscopy and X-ray
fluorescence.
*** Molecules[edit] ***
The combination of atoms into molecules leads to the creation of unique types
of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between
these states. Molecular spectra can be obtained due to electron spin states
(electron_paramagnetic_resonance), molecular_rotations, molecular_vibration,
and electronic states. Rotations are collective motions of the atomic nuclei
and typically lead to spectra in the microwave and millimeter-wave spectral
regions. Rotational spectroscopy and microwave spectroscopy are synonymous.
Vibrations are relative motions of the atomic nuclei and are studied by both
infrared and Raman_spectroscopy. Electronic excitations are studied using
visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy as well as fluorescence_spectroscopy.
Studies in molecular spectroscopy led to the development of the first maser and
contributed to the subsequent development of the laser.
*** Crystals and extended materials[edit] ***
The combination of atoms or molecules into crystals or other extended forms
leads to the creation of additional energetic states. These states are numerous
and therefore have a high density of states. This high density often makes the
spectra weaker and less distinct, i.e., broader. For instance, blackbody
radiation is due to the thermal motions of atoms and molecules within a
material. Acoustic and mechanical responses are due to collective motions as
well. Pure crystals, though, can have distinct spectral transitions, and the
crystal arrangement also has an effect on the observed molecular spectra. The
regular lattice_structure of crystals also scatters x-rays, electrons or
neutrons allowing for crystallographic studies.
*** Nuclei[edit] ***
Nuclei also have distinct energy states that are widely separated and lead to
gamma_ray spectra. Distinct nuclear spin states can have their energy separated
by a magnetic field, and this allows for nuclear_magnetic_resonance
spectroscopy.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_spectroscopy
The history of spectroscopy began with Isaac_Newton's optics experiments
(1666â1672). Newton applied the word "spectrum" to describe the rainbow of
colors that combine to form white light and that are revealed when the white
light is passed through a prism. During the early 1800s, Joseph_von_Fraunhofer
made experimental advances with dispersive spectrometers that enabled
spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique.
Since then, spectroscopy has played and continues to play a significant role in
chemistry, physics, and astronomy.
    * "In 1672, in the first paper that he submitted to the Royal_Society,
      Isaac Newton described an experiment in which he permitted sunlight to
      pass through a small hole and then through a prism. Newton found that
      sunlight, which looks white to us, is actually made up of a mixture of
      all the colors of the rainbow."[14]
    * "In 1802, William_Hyde_Wollaston built an improved spectrometer that
      included a lens to focus the Sunâs spectrum on a screen. Upon use,
      Wollaston realized that the colors were not spread uniformly, but instead
      had missing patches of colors, which appeared as dark bands in the
      spectrum. Later, in 1815, German physicist Joseph_Fraunhofer also
      examined the solar spectrum, and found about 600 such dark lines (missing
      colors), which are now known as Fraunhofer_lines, or Absorption_lines."
