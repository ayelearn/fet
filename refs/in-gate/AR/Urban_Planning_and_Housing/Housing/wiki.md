Housing, or more generally living spaces,[1] refers to the construction and
assigned_usage of houses or buildings collectively, for the purpose of
sheltering people â the planning or provision delivered by an authority, with
related meanings.[2] The social_issue is of ensuring that members of society
have a home in which to live, whether this is a house, or some other kind of
dwelling, lodging, or shelter.[3] Many governments have one or more housing
authorities, sometimes also called a housing ministry, or housing department.

***** Macroeconomy and housing[edit] *****
Previous research shows that housing price is affected by the macroeconomy.
Financial crises, for example, usually reduce the price of housing.[citation
needed]
***** Informal housing[edit] *****
Informal housing settlement in Soweto, South_Africa
The term informal housing can include any form of shelter or settlement (or
lack thereof) which is illegal, falls outside of government control or
regulation, or is not afforded protection by the state.[4] As such, the
informal housing industry is part of the informal_sector.[5] To have informal
housing status is to exist in âa state of deregulation, one where the
ownership, use, and purpose of land cannot be fixed and mapped according to any
prescribed set of regulations or the law.â[4] While there is no global
unified law of property ownership[6] typically, the informal occupant or
community will lack security of tenure and, with this, ready or reliable access
to civic amenities (potable water, electricity and gas supply, sanitation and
waste collection). Due to the informal nature of occupancy, the state will
typically be unable to extract rent or land taxes.
The term informal housing is useful in capturing informal populations other
than those living slum settlements or shanty towns, which are defined more
narrowly by the UN_Habitat as "contiguous settlement where the inhabitants are
characterizes as having inadequate housing and basic services...often not
recognised or addressed by the public authorities an integral or equal part of
the city."[7]
Common categories or terms for informal housing include slums, slum
settlements, shanty_towns, squats, homelessness and pavement_dwellers.
**** Informal housing in developing countries[edit] ****
Homelessness and insecurity of tenure are issues faced by populations around
the world. However, there are particularly pernicious circumstances in
developing countries that lead to a large proportion of the population
resorting to informal housing. According to Saskia_Sassen, in the race to
become a âglobal_cityâ with the requisite state-of-the-art economic and
regulatory platforms for handling the operations of international firms and
markets,â radical physical interventions in the fabric of the city are often
called for, displacing âmodest, low-profit firms and householdsâ.[8]
If these households lack the economic resilience to repurchase in the same area
or relocate to a place that offers similar economic opportunity, they are prime
candidates for informal housing. For example, in Mumbai, India, this fast-paced
economic growth, coupled with inadequate infrastructure, endemic corruption and
the legacy of the restrictive tenancy laws[9] have left the city unable to
house the estimated 54% who now live informally.[10]
Many cities in the developing world are experiencing a rapid increase in
informal housing, driven by mass migration to cities in search of employment or
fleeing from war or environmental disaster. According to Robert_Neuwirth, there
are over 1 billion (one in seven) squatters worldwide. If current trends
continue, this will increase to 2 billion by 2030 (one in four), and 3 billion
by 2050 (one in three).[11] Informal housing, and the often informal
livelihoods that accompany them, are set to be defining features of the cities
of the future.[12]
