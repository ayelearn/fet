Structure Planning is a type of spatial_planning and is part of urban_planning
practice in the United Kingdom and Western Australia. A structure plan in any
jurisdiction will usually consist of a written component, supported by maps,
photographs, sketches, tables and diagrams and a 'plan' component consisting of
one or more plans illustrating land use and infrastructure proposals for the
area being planned.
In the United Kingdom a structure plan was an old-style development_plan
required by United_Kingdom_planning_law between 1968 and 2004. Structure plans
set out strategic planning policies and formed the basis for detailed policies
in local_plans. Although no longer prepared, these plans continue to operate in
many areas following the commencement of the new development plan system
introduced by the Planning_and_Compulsory_Purchase_Act_2004, due to
transitional provisions.
In Western Australia structure plans are commonly prepared at subregional,
district and local levels.[1] Typically, subregional structure plans are
informed by higher level policy and strategy and deliver sufficient information
to identify areas that should be excluded from development, guide the planning
of major infrastructure and the broadscale zoning of land at the regional
level. Similarly, district structure plans are informed by relevant policies
and strategies, any subregional structure plan and by any detailed engineering
of major infrastructure affecting that district. Local structure plans repeat
this process to the level of local roads, land subdivision, sites for community
facilities, parks, utilities, etc. in order to inform the final phase of road
and infrastructure construction and the zoning of the land.
***** United Kingdom History[edit] *****
Structure plans were first introduced by the 1968 Town and Country Planning
Act, as strategic level development plans, prepared either by a county_council
or by local authorities working jointly together. They consisted of a broad
framework of policies looking forward up to 20 years ahead, supported by a "key
diagram" showing land use, transport and environmental proposals
diagrammatically (that is, not on a locationally specific map base). Local
plans, prepared by district rather than county councils, were required to
accord with the overall strategy set out in the structure plan.
Structure plans were increasingly criticised in the 1980s and 1990s for the
length of time taken in their preparation and adoption, their often abstract
nature, and for imposing an unnecessary level of policy above the level of the
local district council. This became increasingly apparent with the
establishment of regional planning conferences (later Regional_Assemblies) and
the development of Regional_Planning_Guidance after the mid-1980s.
Structure plans in the UK were abolished as part of the new development plan
system introduced following the 2004 legislation. They were replaced by
Regional_Spatial_Strategies and by Local_Development_Documents, particularly
Core_Strategies. Regional Spatial Strategies have since been abolished as part
of the 2010 Coalition Government's abolition of Regional Development Agencies.
At a local level, Local Plans are now closest in nature to the former structure
plans.
***** Western Australian Practice[edit] *****
In Western Australia structure plans do not have a legal status under the
Planning and Development Act 2005[2] and cannot therefore directly control the
use of land. However, they are provided for by State Planning Policies prepared
under that Act by the Western_Australian_Planning_Commission[3] and one of
their key functions is to propose land use zoning changes and to provide the
planning logic to support such changes.
In contrast to United Kingdom practice, Australian structure plans are
spatially precise, particularly in regard to the elements of the plan (e.g.
boundaries of land to be protected, land to be reserved for major
infrastructure, etc.) that are intended to be 'fixed' spatially by a particular
plan. Elements that are not intended to be fixed at that level of planning may
be indicated approximately and 'fixed' spatially by a subsequent, more detailed
level of structure plan.
