Central_Park in Manhattan, the first landscaped urban_park in the United States
Landscape design is an independent profession and a design and art tradition,
practiced by landscape designers, combining nature and culture. In contemporary
practice, landscape design bridges the space between landscape_architecture and
garden_design.[1]

***** Design scope[edit] *****
Landscape design focuses on both the integrated master landscape_planning of a
property and the specific garden_design of landscape elements and plants within
it. The practical, aesthetic, horticultural, and environmental sustainability
are also components of landscape design, which is often divided into hardscape
design and softscape design. Landscape designers often collaborate with related
disciplines such as architecture, civil_engineering, surveying, landscape
contracting, and artisan specialties.
Design projects may involve two different professional roles: landscape design
and landscape architecture.
    * Landscape design typically involves artistic composition and artisanship,
      horticultural finesse and expertise, and emphasis on detailed site
      involvement from conceptual stages through to final construction.
    * Landscape architecture focuses more on urban planning, city and regional
      parks, civic and corporate landscapes, large scale interdisciplinary
      projects, and delegation to contractors after completing designs.
There can be significant overlap of talent and skill between the two roles,
depending on the education, licensing, and experience of the professional. Both
landscape designers and landscape architects practice landscape design.[2]
***** Design approach[edit] *****

The landscape design phase consists of research, gathering ideas, and setting a
plan. Design factors include objective qualities such as: climate and micro-
climates; topography and orientation, site drainage and groundwater recharge;
municipal and resource building codes; soils and irrigation; human and
vehicular access and circulation; recreational amenities (i.e., sports and
water); furnishings and lighting; native_plant habitat botany when present;
property safety and security; construction_detailing; and other measurable
considerations.
Design factors also include subjective qualities such as genius_loci (the
special site qualities to emphasize); client's needs and preferences; desirable
plants and elements to retain on site, modify, or replace, and that may be
available for borrowed_scenery from beyond; artistic composition from
perspectives of both looking upon and observing from within; spatial
development and definition â using lines, sense of scale, and balance and
symmetry; plant palettes; and artistic focal_points for enjoyment. There are
innumerable other design factors and considerations brought to the complex
process of designing a garden that is beautiful, well-functioning, and that
thrives over time.
The up-and-coming practice of online landscape design allows professional
landscapers to remotely design and plan sites through manipulation of two-
dimensional images without ever physically visiting the location. Due to the
frequent lack of non-visual, supplementary data such as soil assessments and pH
tests, online landscaping necessarily must focus on incorporating only plants
which are tolerant across many diverse soil conditions.
***** Training[edit] *****
AndrÃ©_Le_NÃ´tre
Historically, landscape designers trained by apprenticingâsuch as AndrÃ©_Le
NÃ´tre, who apprenticed with his father before designing the Gardens_of
Versaillesâto accomplished masters in the field, with the titular name
varying and reputation paramount for a career. The professional section of
garden designers in Europe and the Americas went by the name 'Landscape
Gardener.' In the 1890s, the distinct classification of landscape_architect was
created, with educational and licensing test requirements for using the title
legally. Beatrix_Farrand, the sole woman in the founding group, refused the
title preferring Landscape Gardener. Matching the client and technical needs of
a project, and the appropriate practitioner with talent, legal qualifications,
and experienced skills, surmounts title nomenclature.[citation_needed]
Institutional education in landscape design appeared in the early 20th century.
Over time it became available at various levels. Ornamental horticulture
programs with design components are offered at community college and
universities within schools_of_agriculture or horticulture, with some beginning
to offer garden or landscape design certificates and degrees. Departments of
landscape architecture are located within university schools of architecture or
environmental_design, with undergraduate and graduate degrees offered.
Specialties and minors are available in horticultural_botany, horticulture,
natural_resources, landscape_engineering, construction_management, fine and
applied_arts, and landscape_design_history. Traditionally, hand drawn drawings
documented the design and position of features for construction, but Landscape
design_software is frequently used now.[citation_needed]
Other routes of training are through informal apprenticeships with practicing
landscape designers, landscape architects, landscape contractors, gardeners,
nurseries and garden centers, and docent programs at botanical and public
gardens. Since the landscape designer title does not have college degree or
licensing requirements to be used, there is a very wide range of
sophistication, aesthetic talent, technical expertise, and specialty strengths
to be responsibly matched with specific client and project requirements.
[citation_needed]
***** Gardening[edit] *****
Many landscape designers have an interest and involvement with gardening,
personally or professionally. Gardens are dynamic and not static after
construction and planting are completed, and so in some ways are 'never done.'
Involvement with landscape_management and direction of ongoing garden
direction, evolution, and care depend on the professional's and client's needs
and inclinations. As with the other interrelated landscape disciplines, there
can be overlap of services offered under the titles of landscape designer or
professional gardener.[3]
