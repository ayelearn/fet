Urban space (Piazza_della_Signoria, Florence)
A public space is a place that is generally open and accessible to people.
Roads (including the pavement), public_squares, parks and beaches are typically
considered public space. To a limited extent, government buildings which are
open to the public, such as public_libraries are public spaces, although they
tend to have restricted areas and greater limits upon use. Although not
considered public space, privately owned buildings or property visible from
sidewalks and public thoroughfares may affect the public visual landscape, for
example, by outdoor advertising. Recently, the concept of Shared_space has been
advanced to enhance the experience of pedestrians in public space jointly used
by automobiles and other vehicles.
Public space has also become something of a touchstone for critical_theory in
relation to philosophy, (urban) geography, visual_art, cultural_studies, social
studies and urban_design. The term 'public space' is also often misconstrued to
mean other things such as 'gathering_place', which is an element of the larger
concept of social space.
One of the earliest examples of public spaces are commons. For example, no fees
or paid tickets are required for entry. Non-government-owned malls are examples
of 'private space' with the appearance of being 'public space'.

***** Use of public spaces[edit] *****
**** Right to common passage[edit] ****
In Nordic countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland and also Estonia, all nature
areas are considered public space, due to a law, the allemansrÃ¤tten (the right
to common passage).
**** Restrictions on state action in public spaces in the United States[edit]
****
    If Members of the public had no right whatsoever to distribute leaflets
âor engage in other expressive activity on government-owned              â
    property...then there would be little if any opportunity to exercise
    their rights of freedom of expression.
â Supreme_Court_of_Canada, defending right to poster on public utility poles
and hand out leaflets in public government-owned buildings[1]
In the United States the right of the people to engage in speech and assembly
in public places may not be unreasonably restricted by the federal or state
government.[2] The government cannot usually limit one's speech beyond what is
reasonable in a public space, which is considered to be a public forum (that
is, screaming epithets at passers-by can be stopped; proselytizing one's
religion probably cannot). In a private—that is, non-public—forum, the
government can control one's speech to a much greater degree; for instance,
protesting one's objection to medicare reform will not be tolerated in the
gallery of the United States Senate. This is not to say that the government can
control what one says in their own home or to others; it can only control
government property in this way. The concept of a public forum is not limited
to physical space or public property, for example, a newspaper might be
considered a public forum, but see forum_in_the_legal_sense as the term has a
specific meaning in United States law.
Parks, malls, beaches, waiting rooms, etc., may be closed at night. As this
does not exclude any specific group, it is generally not considered a
restriction on public use. Entry to public parks cannot be restricted based
upon a user's residence.[3]
**** Social norms in public spaces[edit] ****
In some cultures, there is no expectation_of_privacy in a public space, however
civil_inattention is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their
privacy within a crowd.
**** Controversy regarding restrictions on use[edit] ****
Leyton_Marshes, London, an example of land with long established rights of
access, and equally long-standing restrictions
Public space is commonly shared and created for open usage throughout the
community, whereas private space is individually or corporately owned. The area
is built for a range of various types of recreation and entertainment. The
physical setting is socially_constructed, which creates a behavior influence.
Limitations are imposed in the space to prevent certain actions from occurring-
-public behavior that is considered obnoxious or out of character (i.e., drug
and alcohol consumption, urinating, indecent_exposure, etc.)--and are supported
by law or ordinance. Through the landscape and spatial organization of public
space, the social construction is considered to be privately ruled by the
implicit and explicit rules and expectations of the space that are enforced.
Whilst it is generally considered that everyone has a right to access and use
public space, as opposed to private space which may have restrictions, there
has been some academic interest in how public spaces are managed to exclude
certain groups - specifically homeless[4] people and young[5] people.
Measures are taken to make the public space less attractive to them, including
the removal or design of benches to restrict their use for sleeping and
resting, restricting access to certain times, locking indoor/enclosed areas.
Police forces are sometimes involved in moving 'unwanted' members of the public
from public spaces. In fact, by not being provided suitable access, disabled
people are implicitly excluded from some spaces.
**** As a site for democracy[edit] ****
Human geographers have argued that in spite of the exclusions that are part of
public space, it can nonetheless be conceived of as a site where democracy
becomes possible. Geographer Don Mitchell has written extensively on the topic
of public space and its relation to democracy, employing Henri_Lefebvre's
notion of the right to the city in articulating his argument.[6] While
democracy and public space don't entirely coincide, it is the potential of
their intersection that becomes politically important. Other geographers like
Gill Valentine have focused on performativity and visibility in public spaces,
which brings a theatrical component or 'space of appearance' that is central to
the functioning of a democratic space.[7]
**** Privatization[edit] ****
Main article: Privately_owned_public_space
A privately owned public space, also known as a privately_owned_public_open
space (POPOS), is a public space that is open to the public, but owned by a
private entity, typically a commercial property_developer. Conversion of
publicly_owned public spaces to privately owned public spaces is referred to as
the privatization of public space, and is a common result of urban
redevelopment.[8]
Beginning roughly in the 1960s, the privatization of public space (especially
in urban centers) has faced criticism from citizen groups such as the Open
Spaces_Society. Private-public_partnerships have taken significant control of
public parks and playgrounds through conservancy groups set up to manage what
is considered unmanageable by public agencies. Corporate sponsorship of public
leisure areas is ubiquitous, giving open space to the public in exchange for
higher air_rights. This facilitates the construction of taller buildings with
private parks.
In one of the newer U.S. incarnations of the private-public partnership, the
business_improvement_district (BID), private organizations are allowed to tax
local businesses and retail establishments so that they might provide special
private services such as policing and increased surveillance, trash removal, or
street renovation, all of which once fell under the control of public funds.
**** Semi-public spaces[edit] ****
A broader meaning of public space or place includes also places where everybody
can come if they pay, like a cafÃ©, train, or movie_theater. A shop is an
example of what is intermediate between the two meanings: everybody can enter
and look around without obligation to buy, but activities unrelated to the
purpose of the shop are not unlimitedly permitted.
The halls and streets (including skyways) in a shopping_center may be declared
a public place and may be open when the shops are closed. Similarly for halls,
railway_platforms and waiting_rooms of public_transport; sometimes a travelling
ticket is required. A public_library is a public place. A rest_stop or truck
stop is a public space.
For these "semi-public" spaces stricter rules may apply than outside, e.g.
regarding dress_code, trading, begging, advertising, photography, propaganda,
riding rollerskates, skateboards, a Segway, etc.

***** Public space in design theory[edit] *****
Public space, as a term and as a concept in design, is volatile. There is much
conversation around what constitutes public space, what role it plays, and how
design should approach and deal with it.
**** Historical shift[edit] ****
Historically, public space in the west has been limited to town centres,
plazas, church squares, i.e. nearly always engineered around a central
monument, which informs the program of the space. These spaces acted as the
'commons' of the people; a political, social and cultural arena. Of the
thirteen colonies that became the United States, three were comprehensively
planned with integrated physical, social, and economic elements. These planned
colonies of Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia each placed emphasis on public
space, in particular the public square. The plan for Georgia, known as the
Oglethorpe_Plan created a unique design in which a public square was created
for every ward of forty residential lots and four civic or commercial lots. The
design has been preserved in the Savannah_historic_district.[9][10][11]
JÃ¼rgen_Habermas' concept of the public_sphere links its emergence with the
development of democracy.[12] A good example of this is the New_Deal projects.
The New Deal was a brief period in the US under Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
government that produced a huge number of public works in an economic effort to
boost employment during the depression. The result, however, was more than
this. They constituted a legacy of what has been called the cultural
infrastructure underlying American public space.[13] The New Deal projects have
been credited with significantly contributing to the quality of American life
and encouraging unity between all aspects of the community. It has been
recently argued, however, that the democratic ideal of public life through the
use of public space has deteriorated. As our cities accelerate towards
segregation (social, economic, cultural, ethnic), the opportunity for public
interaction is on the decline. John Chase writes, "The importance of voluntary
and obligatory participation in civic life has been usurped by the
consciousness of the arbitrary nature of assigned cultural meanings and by the
increasingly important role that consumption of goods and services plays in the
formation of individual identity."[14]
**** Modern critique[edit] ****
Modern architectural critics have lamented on the 'narrative of loss' within
the public sphere. That is, modern society has withdrawn from public life that
used to inform city centres. Political and social needs, and forums for
expression, can now be accessed from the home. This sentiment is reflected in
Michael Sorkin's and Mike Davis' declaration of "the end of public space" and
the "destruction of any truly democratic urban spaces."[15] Another side of the
debate, however, argues that it is people who apply meaning to public space,
wherever it may be. It has been suggested that the concepts of public, space,
democracy, and citizenship are being redefined by people through lived
experience.[16] Discussion has surfaced around the idea that, historically,
public space has been inherently contradictory in the way that it has always
been exclusive in who has been able to participate. This has caused the
"counterpublics", as identified by Nancy Fraser,[17] to establish their own
public spaces to respond to their own concerns. These spaces are in constant
flux, and in response, its users restructure and reinterpret physical space. An
example of this is in the African-American neighbourhood, Baldwin_Hills,_Los
Angeles. Here, a parking lot has evolved into a scene of intense commercial and
social activity. Locals gather here to meet and socialise, sell and consume
goods. The example has been used to illustrate that the historical ideal of
fixed public space around a monument is not viable for a contemporary diverse
social range as "no single physical space can represent a completely inclusive
'space of democracy'."[16]
**** Art in public space[edit] ****

Main article: Public_art
This sense of flux and change, informs how contemporary public art has evolved.
Temporal art in public spaces has been a long established practice. But the
presence of public art has become increasingly prevalent and important within
our contemporary cities. Temporal public art is so important because of its
ability to respond to, reflect, and explore the context which it inhabits.
Patricia Phillips describes the "social desire for an art that is contemporary
and timely, that responds to and reflects its temporal and circumstantial
context."[18] Public art is an arena for investigation, exploration and
articulation of the dense and diverse public landscape. Public art asks its
audience to re-imagine, re-experience, re-view and re-live. In the design
field, a heavy focus has been turned onto the city as needing to discover new
and inspired ways to re-use, re-establish and re-invent the city, in step with
an invigorated interest in rejuvenating our cities for a sustainable future.
Contemporary design has become obsessed with the need to save the modern city
from an industrialized, commercialized, urban pit of a death bed.[citation
needed]
**** Approaching urban design[edit] ****
Contemporary perception of public space has now branched and grown into a
multitude of non-traditional sites with a variety of programs in mind. It is
for this reason that the way in which design deals with public space as a
discipline, has become such a diverse and indefinable field.
Iris Aravot puts forward an interesting approach to the urban design process,
with the idea of the 'narrative-myth'. Aravot argues that "conventional
analysis and problem solving methods result in fragmentation...of the authentic
experience of a city...[and] something of the liveliness of the city as a
singular entity is lost."[19] The process of developing a narrative-myth in
urban design involves analysing and understanding the unique aspects of the
local culture based on Cassirer's five distinctive "symbolic forms".[20] They
are myth and religion, art, language, history and science; aspects often
disregarded by professional practice. Aravot suggests that the narrative-myth
"imposes meaning specifically on what is still inexplicable", i.e. the essence
of a city.
