ITS graphical_user_interface displaying the Hungarian_highway_network and its
data points
An intelligent transportation system (ITS) is an advanced application which,
without embodying intelligence as such, aims to provide innovative services
relating to different modes_of_transport and traffic_management and enable
users to be better informed and make safer, more coordinated, and 'smarter' use
of transport_networks.
Although ITS may refer to all modes of transport, the directive of the European
Union 2010/40/EU, made on the 7 July 2010, defined ITS as systems in which
information_and_communication_technologies are applied in the field of road
transport, including infrastructure, vehicles and users, and in traffic
management and mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other modes
of transport.[1] ITS may improve the efficiency of transport in a number of
situations, i.e. road transport, traffic management, mobility, etc.[2]

***** Background[edit] *****
Recent[when?] governmental[which?] activity in the area of ITS â is further
motivated by an increasing focus on homeland_security. Many of the proposed ITS
systems also involve surveillance of the roadways, which is a priority of
homeland security.[3] Funding of many systems comes either directly through
homeland security organisations or with their approval. Further, ITS can play a
role in the rapid mass_evacuation of people in urban centers after large
casualty events such as a result of a natural disaster or threat. Much of the
infrastructure and planning involved with ITS parallels the need for homeland
security systems.
In the developing_world, the migration from rural to urbanized_habitats has
progressed differently. Many areas of the developing world have urbanised
without significant motorisation and the formation of suburbs. A small portion
of the population can afford automobiles, but the automobiles greatly increase
congestion in these multimodal_transportation systems. They also produce
considerable air_pollution, pose a significant safety risk, and exacerbate
feelings of inequities in the society. High population density could be
supported by a multimodal system of walking, bicycle transportation,
motorcycles, buses, and trains.
Other parts of the developing world, such as China, India and Brazil remain
largely rural but are rapidly urbanising and industrialising. In these areas a
motorised infrastructure is being developed alongside motorisation of the
population. Great disparity of wealth means that only a fraction of the
population can motorise, and therefore the highly dense multimodal
transportation_system for the poor is cross-cut by the highly motorised
transportation system for the rich.
***** Intelligent transportation technologies[edit] *****
Intelligent transport systems vary in technologies applied, from basic
management systems such as car_navigation; traffic_signal control systems;
container management systems; variable message signs; automatic_number_plate
recognition or speed_cameras to monitor applications, such as security CCTV
systems; and to more advanced applications that integrate live data and
feedback from a number of other sources, such as parking_guidance_and
information systems; weather_information; bridge de-icing (US deicing) systems;
and the like. Additionally, predictive techniques are being developed to allow
advanced modelling and comparison with historical baseline data. Some of these
technologies are described in the following sections.[4]
***** Wireless communications[edit] *****
Traffic monitoring gantry with wireless communication dish_antenna
Various forms of wireless communications technologies have been proposed for
intelligent transportation systems. Radio_modem communication on UHF and VHF
frequencies are widely used for short and long range communication within ITS.
Short-range communications of 350 m can be accomplished using IEEE_802.11
protocols, specifically WAVE or the Dedicated_Short_Range_Communications
standard being promoted by the Intelligent_Transportation_Society_of_America
and the United_States_Department_of_Transportation. Theoretically, the range of
these protocols can be extended using Mobile_ad_hoc_networks or Mesh
networking.
Longer range communications have been proposed using infrastructure networks
such as WiMAX (IEEE_802.16), Global_System_for_Mobile_Communications (GSM), or
3G. Long-range communications using these methods are well established, but,
unlike the short-range protocols, these methods require extensive and very
expensive infrastructure deployment. There is lack of consensus as to what
business model should support this infrastructure.
Auto_insurance companies have utilised ad hoc solutions to support eCall and
behavioural_tracking functionalities in the form of Telematics_2.0.
**** Computational technologies[edit] ****
Recent advances in vehicle_electronics have led to a move towards fewer, more
capable computer processors on a vehicle. A typical vehicle in the early 2000s
would have between 20 and 100 individual networked microcontroller/Programmable
logic_controller modules with non-real-time operating_systems. The current
trend is toward fewer, more costly microprocessor modules with hardware memory
management and real-time_operating_systems. The new embedded_system platforms
allow for more sophisticated software_applications to be implemented, including
model-based process_control, artificial_intelligence, and ubiquitous_computing.
Perhaps the most important of these for Intelligent Transportation Systems is
artificial_intelligence.[citation_needed]
**** Floating car data/floating cellular data[edit] ****
Main article: Floating_car_data
RFID E-ZPass reader attached to the pole and its antenna (right) used in
traffic monitoring in New York City by using vehicle re-identification method
"Floating car" or "probe" data collected other transport routes. Broadly
speaking, four methods have been used to obtain the raw data:
    * Triangulation method. In developed countries a high proportion of cars
      contain one or more mobile_phones. The phones periodically transmit their
      presence information to the mobile phone network, even when no voice
      connection is established. In the mid-2000s, attempts were made to use
      mobile_phones as anonymous traffic probes. As a car moves, so does the
      signal of any mobile phones that are inside the vehicle. By measuring and
      analysing network data using triangulation, pattern matching or cell-
      sector statistics (in an anonymous format), the data was converted into
      traffic_flow information. With more congestion, there are more cars, more
      phones, and thus, more probes. In metropolitan areas, the distance
      between antennas is shorter and in theory accuracy increases. An
      advantage of this method is that no infrastructure needs to be built
      along the road; only the mobile phone network is leveraged. But in
      practice the triangulation method can be complicated, especially in areas
      where the same mobile phone towers serve two or more parallel routes
      (such as a motorway (freeway) with a frontage road, a motorway (freeway)
      and a commuter rail line, two or more parallel streets, or a street that
      is also a bus line). By the early 2010s, the popularity of the
      triangulation method was declining[citation_needed].
    * Vehicle re-identification. Vehicle re-identification methods require sets
      of detectors mounted along the road. In this technique, a unique serial
      number for a device in the vehicle is detected at one location and then
      detected again (re-identified) further down the road. Travel times and
      speed are calculated by comparing the time at which a specific device is
      detected by pairs of sensors. This can be done using the MAC_addresses
      from Bluetooth or other devices,[5] or using the RFID serial numbers from
      electronic_toll_collection (ETC) transponders (also called "toll tags").
    * GPS based methods. An increasing number of vehicles are equipped with in-
      vehicle satnav/GPS (satellite_navigation) systems that have two-way
      communication with a traffic data provider. Position readings from these
      vehicles are used to compute vehicle speeds. Modern methods may not use
      dedicated hardware but instead Smartphone based solutions using so called
      Telematics_2.0 approaches.[citation_needed]
    * Smartphone-based rich monitoring. Smartphones having various sensors can
      be used to track traffic speed and density. The accelerometer data from
      smartphones used by car drivers is monitored to find out traffic speed
      and road quality. Audio data and GPS tagging of smartphones enables
      identification of traffic density and possible traffic jams. This was
      implemented in Bangalore, India as a part of a research experimental
      system Nericell.[6]
Floating car data technology provides advantages over other methods of traffic
measurement:
    * Less expensive than sensors or cameras
    * More coverage (potentially including all locations and streets)
    * Faster to set up and less maintenance
    * Works in all weather conditions, including heavy rain
**** Sensing technologies[edit] ****
Technological advances in telecommunications and information technology,
coupled with ultramodern/state-of-the-art microchip, RFID (Radio Frequency
Identification), and inexpensive intelligent beacon sensing technologies, have
enhanced the technical capabilities that will facilitate motorist safety
benefits for intelligent transportation systems globally. Sensing systems for
ITS are vehicle- and infrastructure-based networked systems, i.e., Intelligent
vehicle_technologies. Infrastructure sensors are indestructible (such as in-
road reflectors) devices that are installed or embedded in the road or
surrounding the road (e.g., on buildings, posts, and signs), as required, and
may be manually disseminated during preventive road_construction maintenance or
by sensor injection machinery for rapid deployment. Vehicle-sensing systems
include deployment of infrastructure-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure
electronic beacons for identification communications and may also employ video
automatic_number_plate_recognition or vehicle magnetic signature detection
technologies at desired intervals to increase sustained monitoring of vehicles
operating in critical zones of world.
*** Inductive loop detection[edit] ***
Saw cut loop detectors for vehicle detection buried in the pavement at this
intersection as seen by the rectangular shapes of loop detector sealant at the
bottom part of this picture.
Inductive_loops can be placed in a roadbed to detect vehicles as they pass
through the loop's magnetic field. The simplest detectors simply count the
number of vehicles during a unit of time (typically 60 seconds in the United
States) that pass over the loop, while more sophisticated sensors estimate the
speed, length, and class of vehicles and the distance between them. Loops can
be placed in a single lane or across multiple lanes, and they work with very
slow or stopped vehicles as well as vehicles moving at high speed.
*** Video vehicle detection[edit] ***
Traffic-flow measurement and automatic incident detection using video cameras
is another form of vehicle detection. Since video detection systems such as
those used in automatic_number_plate_recognition do not involve installing any
components directly into the road surface or roadbed, this type of system is
known as a "non-intrusive" method of traffic detection. Video from cameras is
fed into processors that analyse the changing characteristics of the video
image as vehicles pass. The cameras are typically mounted on poles or
structures above or adjacent to the roadway. Most video detection systems
require some initial configuration to "teach" the processor the baseline
background image. This usually involves inputting known measurements such as
the distance between lane lines or the height of the camera above the roadway.
A single video detection processor can detect traffic simultaneously from one
to eight cameras, depending on the brand and model. The typical output from a
video detection system is lane-by-lane vehicle speeds, counts, and lane
occupancy readings. Some systems provide additional outputs including gap,
headway, stopped-vehicle detection, and wrong-way vehicle alarms.
*** Bluetooth detection[edit] ***
Bluetooth is an accurate and inexpensive way to transmit position from a
vehicle in motion. Bluetooth devices in passing vehicles are detected by
sensing devices along the road. If these sensors are interconnected they are
able to calculate travel time and provide data for origin and destination
matrices. Compared to other traffic measurement technologies, Bluetooth
measurement has some differences:
    * Accurate measurement points with absolute confirmation to provide to the
      second travel times.
    * Is non-intrusive, which can lead to lower-cost installations for both
      permanent and temporary sites.
    * Is limited to how many Bluetooth devices are broadcasting in a vehicle so
      counting and other applications are limited.
    * Systems are generally quick to set up with little to no calibration
      needed.
Since Bluetooth devices become more prevalent on board vehicles and with more
portable electronics broadcasting, the amount of data collected over time
becomes more accurate and valuable for travel time and estimation purposes,
more information can be found in.[7]

It is also possible to measure traffic_density on a road using the audio_signal
that consists of the cumulative sound from tire_noise, engine noise, engine-
idling noise, honks and air_turbulence noise. A roadside-installed microphone
picks up the audio that comprises the various vehicle noise and audio_signal
processing techniques can be used to estimate the traffic state. The accuracy
of such a system compares well with the other methods described above.[8]
*** Information fusion from multiple traffic sensing modalities[edit] ***
The data from the different sensing technologies can be combined in intelligent
ways to determine the traffic state accurately. A Data_fusion based approach
that utilizes the road side collected acoustic, image and sensor data has been
shown to combine the advantages of the different individual methods.[9]
***** Intelligent transportation applications[edit] *****
**** Emergency vehicle notification systems[edit] ****
The in-vehicle eCall is generated either manually by the vehicle occupants or
automatically via activation of in-vehicle sensors after an accident. When
activated, the in-vehicle eCall device will establish an emergency call
carrying both voice and data directly to the nearest emergency point (normally
the nearest E1-1-2 public_safety_answering_point, PSAP). The voice call enables
the vehicle occupant to communicate with the trained eCall operator. At the
same time, a minimum set of data will be sent to the eCall operator receiving
the voice call.
The minimum set of data contains information about the incident, including
time, precise location, the direction the vehicle was traveling, and vehicle
identification. The pan-European eCall aims to be operative for all new type-
approved vehicles as a standard option. Depending on the manufacturer of the
eCall system, it could be mobile phone based (Bluetooth connection to an in-
vehicle interface), an integrated eCall device, or a functionality of a broader
system like navigation, Telematics device, or tolling device. eCall is expected
to be offered, at earliest, by the end of 2010, pending standardization by the
European_Telecommunications_Standards_Institute and commitment from large EU
member states such as France and the United Kingdom.

The EC funded project SafeTRIP[citation_needed] is developing an open ITS
system that will improve road safety and provide a resilient communication
through the use of S-band satellite communication. Such platform will allow for
greater coverage of the Emergency Call Service within the EU.
**** Automatic road enforcement[edit] ****
Main article: Traffic_enforcement_camera
Automatic_speed_enforcement gantry or "Lombada EletrÃ´nica" with ground sensors
at Brasilia,_D.F.
A traffic enforcement camera system, consisting of a camera and a vehicle-
monitoring device, is used to detect and identify vehicles disobeying a speed
limit or some other road legal requirement and automatically ticket offenders
based on the license plate number. Traffic tickets are sent by mail.
Applications include:
    * Speed cameras that identify vehicles traveling over the legal speed
      limit. Many such devices use radar to detect a vehicle's speed or
      electromagnetic loops buried in each lane of the road.
    * Red_light_cameras that detect vehicles that cross a stop line or
      designated stopping place while a red traffic_light is showing.
    * Bus_lane cameras that identify vehicles traveling in lanes reserved for
      buses. In some jurisdictions, bus lanes can also be used by taxis or
      vehicles engaged in car_pooling.
    * Level_crossing cameras that identify vehicles crossing railways at_grade
      illegally.
    * Double white line cameras that identify vehicles crossing these lines.
    * High-occupancy_vehicle_lane cameras that identify vehicles violating HOV
      requirements.
**** Variable speed limits[edit] ****
Further information: Speed_limit_Â§ Variable_speed_limits
Example variable speed limit sign in the United States.
Recently some jurisdictions have begun experimenting with variable speed limits
that change with road congestion and other factors. Typically such speed limits
only change to decline during poor conditions, rather than being improved in
good ones. One example is on Britain's M25_motorway, which circumnavigates
London. On the most heavily traveled 14-mile (23 km) section (junction 10 to
16) of the M25 variable speed limits combined with automated enforcement have
been in force since 1995. Initial results indicated savings in journey times,
smoother-flowing traffic, and a fall in the number of accidents, so the
implementation was made permanent in 1997. Further trials on the M25 have been
thus far proven inconclusive.[10]
**** Dynamic traffic light sequence[edit] ****
A 2008 paper was written about using RFID for dynamic traffic_light sequences.
It circumvents or avoids problems that usually arise with systems that use
image processing and beam interruption techniques. RFID technology with
appropriate algorithm and database were applied to a multi-vehicle, multi-lane
and multi-road junction area to provide an efficient time management scheme. A
dynamic time schedule was worked out for the passage of each column. The
simulation showed the dynamic sequence algorithm could adjust itself even with
the presence of some extreme cases. The paper said the system could emulate the
judgment of a traffic police officer on duty, by considering the number of
vehicles in each column and the routing proprieties.[11]
**** Collision avoidance systems[edit] ****
Japan has installed sensors on its highways to notify motorists that a car is
stalled ahead.[12]
***** Cooperative systems on the road[edit] *****

Communication cooperation on the road includes car-to-car, car-to-
infrastructure, and vice versa. Data available from vehicles are acquired and
transmitted to a server for central fusion and processing. These data can be
used to detect events such as rain (wiper activity) and congestion (frequent
braking activities). The server processes a driving recommendation dedicated to
a single or a specific group of drivers and transmits it wirelessly to
vehicles. The goal of cooperative systems is to use and plan communication and
sensor infrastructure to increase road safety. The definition of cooperative
systems in road traffic is according to the European_Commission:[13][14]
      "Road operators, infrastructure, vehicles, their drivers and other road
      users will cooperate to deliver the most efficient, safe, secure and
      comfortable journey. The vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure co-
      operative systems will contribute to these objectives beyond the
      improvements achievable with stand-alone systems."
World_Congress_on_Intelligent_Transport_Systems- ITS World Congress is an
annual trade show to promote ITS technologies. ERTICOâ ITS Europe, ITS
America and ITS AsiaPacific sponsor the annual ITS World Congress and
exhibition. Each year the event takes place in a different region (Europe,
Americas or Asia-Pacific).[15] The first ITS World Congress was held in Paris
in 1994.

***** Smart Transportation â New Business Models[edit] *****
New mobility and smart transportation models are emerging globally. Bike
sharing, car_sharing and scooter_sharing schemes like Lime or Bird are
continuing to gain popularity; electric_vehicle_charging_schemes are taking off
in many cities; the connected_car is a growing market segment; while new, smart
parking solutions are being used by commuters and shoppers all over the world.
All these new models provide opportunities for solving last mile issues in
urban_areas.
**** ITS in the Connected World[edit] ****
Mobile_operators are becoming a significant player in these value chains
(beyond providing just connectivity). Dedicated apps can be used to take mobile
payments, provide data insights and navigation tools, offer incentives and
discounts, and act as a digital_commerce medium.
**** Payments and Billing Flexibility[edit] ****
These new mobility models call for high monetization agility and partner
management capabilities. A flexible settlements and billing platform enables
revenues to be shared quickly and easily and provides an overall better
customer_experience. As well as a better service, users can also be rewarded by
discounts, loyalty_points and rewards, and engaged via direct_marketing.
***** Europe[edit] *****
The Network of National ITS Associations is a grouping of national ITS
interests. It was officially announced 7 October 2004 in London. The
secretariat is at ERTICO â ITS Europe.[16]
ERTICO_â_ITS_Europe is a public/private partnership promoting the development
and deployment of ITS. They connect public authorities, industry players,
infrastructure operators, users, national ITS associations and other
organisations together. The ERTICO work programme focuses on initiatives to
improve transport safety, security and network efficiency whilst taking into
account measures to reduce environmental impact.
***** United States[edit] *****
In the United States, each state has an ITS chapter that holds a yearly
conference to promote and showcase ITS technologies and ideas. Representatives
from each Department of Transportation (state, cities, towns, and counties)
within the state attend this conference.
