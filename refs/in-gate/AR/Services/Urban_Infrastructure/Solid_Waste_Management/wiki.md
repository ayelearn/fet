Waste management (or waste disposal) are the activities and actions required to
manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.[1] This includes the
collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with
monitoring and regulation of the waste management process.
Waste can be solid, liquid, or gaseous and each type has different methods of
disposal and management. Waste management deals with all types of waste,
including industrial, biological and household. In some cases, waste can pose a
threat to human health.[2] Waste is produced by human activity, for example,
the extraction and processing of raw materials.[3] Waste management is intended
to reduce adverse effects of waste on human health, the environment or
aesthetics.
Waste management practices are not uniform among countries (developed and
developing_nations); regions (urban and rural_areas), and residential and
industrial sectors can all take different approaches.[4]
A large portion of waste management practices deal with municipal_solid_waste
(MSW) which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household, industrial,
and commercial activity.[5]

***** Principles of waste management[edit] *****
Diagram of the waste hierarchy
**** Waste hierarchy[edit] ****
The waste_hierarchy refers to the "3 Rs" reduce, reuse and recycle, which
classifies waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms
of waste_minimisation. The waste hierarchy is the cornerstone of most waste
minimisation strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the
maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of
end waste; see: resource_recovery.[6] The waste hierarchy is represented as a
pyramid because the basic premise is that policies should promote measures to
prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action is to seek
alternative uses for the waste that has been generated i.e. by re-use. The next
is recycling which includes composting. Following this step is material
recovery and waste-to-energy. The final action is disposal, in landfills or
through incineration without energy_recovery. This last step is the final
resort for waste which has not been prevented, diverted or recovered.[7]
[page needed] The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or
material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management. The
hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.
**** Life-cycle of a product[edit] ****
The life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture,
distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's
stages of reduce, reuse and recycle. Each stage in the life-cycle offers
opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to
redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.[7][page needed]
Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited
resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.
**** Resource efficiency[edit] ****
Resource_efficiency reflects the understanding that global economic growth and
development can not be sustained at current production and consumption
patterns. Globally, humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the
planet can replenish.[7][page needed] Resource efficiency is the reduction of
the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods,
from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal.
**** Polluter-pays principle[edit] ****
The polluter-pays_principle mandates that the polluting party pays for the
impact on the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally
refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal
of the unrecoverable material.
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_waste_management
Throughout most of history, the amount of waste generated by humans was
insignificant due to low population_density and low societal levels of the
exploitation_of_natural_resources as well as industrial since few decades.
Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human
biodegradable_waste, and these were released back into the ground locally, with
minimum environmental_impact. Tools made out of wood or metal were generally
reused or passed down through the generations.
However, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste
output than others. In particular, the Maya of Central_America had a fixed
monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and
burn their rubbish in large dumps.[8]
**** Modern era[edit] ****
Sir Edwin_Chadwick's 1842 report The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring
Population was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation
aimed at waste clearance and disposal.
Following the onset of industrialisation and the sustained urban growth of
large population centres in England, the buildup of waste in the cities caused
a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban
life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance
regulations.[9] Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste
removal powers occurred as early as 1751, when Corbyn_Morris in London proposed
that "... as the preservation of the health of the people is of great
importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under
one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the Thames to
proper distance in the country".[10]
However, it was not until the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly
devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that
the first legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new
focus was the report The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population in 1842
[11] of the social_reformer, Edwin_Chadwick, in which he argued for the
importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the
health and wellbeing of the city's population.
In the UK, the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of 1846 began what
was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste
management in London. The Metropolitan_Board_of_Works was the first citywide
authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city
and the Public_Health_Act_1875 made it compulsory for every household to
deposit their weekly waste in "moveable receptacles" for disposalâthe first
concept for a dust-bin.[12]
Manlove,_Alliott_&_Co._Ltd. 1894 destructor furnace. The use of incinerators
for waste disposal became popular in the late 19th century.
The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first
incineration plants, or, as they were then called, "destructors". In 1874, the
first incinerator was built in Nottingham by Manlove,_Alliott_&_Co._Ltd. to the
design of Alfred Fryer.[10] However, these were met with opposition on account
of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the
neighbouring areas.[13]
Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th
century in other large cities of Europe and North_America. In 1895, New_York
City became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.[12]
Early garbage_removal_trucks were simply open bodied dump_trucks pulled by a
team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and
the first closed body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism
were introduced in the 1920s in Britain.[14] These were soon equipped with
'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then
hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood_Load_Packer
was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.
***** Waste handling and transport[edit] *****
Main articles: Waste_collection_vehicle, Dustbin, and Waste_sorting
Moulded plastic, wheeled waste bin in Berkshire, England
Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions.
Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government
authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some
areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-
collection systems.
**** Waste handling practices[edit] ****
Curbside_collection is the most common method of disposal in most European
countries, Canada, New_Zealand, United_States, and many other parts of the
developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised
trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural
areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then
transported to an appropriate disposal facility. In some areas, vacuum
collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial
premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and
North America.
Main article: Automated_vacuum_collection
In some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from
waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste.
Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging
recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner. In San
Francisco, the local government established its Mandatory Recycling and
Composting Ordinance in support of its goal of "Zero waste by 2020", requiring
everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill.
The three streams are collected with the curbside "Fantastic 3" bin system â
blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound
materials â provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San
Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's "Pay-As-You-Throw" system
charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a
financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other
discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led
the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.
[15] Other businesses such as Waste_Industries use a variety of colors to
distinguish between trash and recycling cans.
***** Financial models[edit] *****
In most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national
or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and
industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service,
often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may
encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as
landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and
recycling.
In some areas such as Taipei, the city government charges its households and
industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the
city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy
has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased
the recycling rate.[citation_needed]
Morocco has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary
landfill system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's
government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or
consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.[16]
***** Disposal methods[edit] *****
**** Landfill[edit] ****
Main article: Landfill

**** Incineration[edit] ****
Main article: Incineration
Incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected
to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This
method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue
from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by
80 to 95 percent.[17] Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment
systems are sometimes described as "thermal_treatment". Incinerators convert
waste materials into heat, gas, steam, and ash.
Incineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large
scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It
is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain hazardous_waste
materials (such as biological medical_waste). Incineration is a controversial
method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous pollutants.
Incineration is common in countries such as Japan where land is more scarce, as
the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. Waste-to-
energy (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that
burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity.
Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns
about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular
concern has focused on some very persistent organic_compounds such as dioxins,
furans, and PAHs, which may be created and which may have serious environmental
consequences.
***** Recycling[edit] *****
Main article: Recycling
Waste not the Waste. Sign in Tamil_Nadu, India
Steel crushed and baled for recycling
Recycling is a resource_recovery practice that refers to the collection and
reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from
which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for
recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins
and collection vehicles, a procedure called kerbside_collection. In some
communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into
different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In
other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for
collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter
method is known as "single-stream_recycling."[18][19]
The most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverage
cans, copper such as wire, steel from food and aerosol cans, old steel
furnishings or equipment, rubber tyres, polyethylene and PET bottles, glass
bottles and jars, paperboard cartons, newspapers, magazines and light paper,
and corrugated_fiberboard boxes.
PVC, LDPE, PP, and PS (see resin_identification_code) are also recyclable.
These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them
relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products
(such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the
additional dismantling and separation required.
The type of material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each
city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the
various types of recyclable materials. However, certain variation in acceptance
is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In
July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of
recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper,
placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported
directly or indirectly to China.[20]
***** Re-use[edit] *****
**** Biological reprocessing[edit] ****
Main articles: Composting, Home_composting, Anaerobic_digestion, and Microbial
fuel_cell
An active compost heap.
Recoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as plant_material, food
scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through composting and digestion
processes to decompose the organic matter. The resulting organic material is
then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In
addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used
for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies.
The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and
accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See
resource_recovery).
**** Energy recovery[edit] ****
Main article: Waste-to-energy
Energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials
into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes,
including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and
landfill_gas recovery.[21] This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy
recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy.
Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into
electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon
emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as
reduce methane generation from landfills.[21] Globally, waste-to-energy
accounts for 16% of waste management.[22]
The energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as
a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of
fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or
heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for boilers to
generate steam and electricity in a turbine. Pyrolysis and gasification are two
related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high
temperatures with limited oxygen availability. The process usually occurs in a
sealed vessel under high pressure. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the
material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt
to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery).
The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as activated
carbon. Gasification and advanced Plasma_arc_gasification are used to convert
organic materials directly into a synthetic gas (syngas) composed of carbon
monoxide and hydrogen. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and steam.
An alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical
water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).
**** Pyrolysis[edit] ****
Main article: Pyrolysis
Pyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial
residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input (such as plant
waste, food waste, tyres) placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an
alternative to fossil fuels.[23] Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical
decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric
quantities of oxygen; the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases.[24]
During pyrolysis, the molecules of object vibrate at high frequencies to an
extent that molecules start breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with
temperature. In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430 Â°C
(800 Â°F).[25] Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal.[26] Pyrolysis
hold promise for conversion of waste_biomass into useful liquid fuel. Pyrolysis
of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from
pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert
to gas. Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis
processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur,
and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the
environment such as HCl and SO2.[27]
**** Resource recovery[edit] ****
Main article: Resource_recovery
Resource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for
disposal, for a specific next use.[28] It is the processing of recyclables to
extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.[29] These
activities are performed at a resource recovery facility.[29] Resource recovery
is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective.[30] It
decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and
conserves natural resources.[30]
Resource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle
analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW
(Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that
administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and
recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer
production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured
path.
As an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown
away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit, such as the
components in circuit boards. Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging
materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled
chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.
Application of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a
range of benefits including:
   1. Economic â Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource
      use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to
      efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and
      materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and
      the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.
   2. Social â By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste
      management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic
      communities. Better social advantages can lead to new sources of
      employment and potentially lifting communities out of poverty especially
      in some of the developing poorer countries and cities.
   3. Environmental â Reducing or eliminating adverse impacts on the
      environment through reducing, reusing and recycling, and minimizing
      resource extraction can result in improved air and water quality and help
      in the reduction of greenhouse_gas emissions.
   4. Inter-generational Equity â Following effective waste management
      practises can provide subsequent generations a more robust economy, a
      fairer and more inclusive_society and a cleaner environment.[7]
      [page needed]
**** Sustainability[edit] ****
The management of waste is a key component in a business' ability to maintain
ISO14001 accreditation. The standard encourages companies to improve their
environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through resource
recovery practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery
practices like recycling materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and
cardboard, plastic_bottles and metal. Recycled materials can often be sold to
the construction industry. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce
materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial
gravel. This topic was on the agenda of the International WASCON conference in
Spain in June 2015 and on the international Conference on Green Urbanism, held
in Italy 12â14 October 2016.[citation_needed]
***** Liquid waste-management[edit] *****
**** Sewage sludge[edit] ****
Main article: Sewage_sludge_treatment
Sewage sludge is produced by waste water treatment processes. Due to rapid
urbanization, there has been an increase in municipal waste water that results
0.1â30.8 kg of sewage per population equivalent per year (kg/p.e/year).[31]
Common disposal practices of sewage sludge are incineration, composting, and
landfill.
***** Avoidance and reduction methods[edit] *****
Main article: Waste_minimization
An important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material
being created, also known as waste_reduction. Methods of avoidance include
reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new
ones, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead
of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable
products (such as disposable cutlery), removing any food/liquid remains from
cans and packaging,[32] and designing products that use less material to
achieve the same purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).[33]
***** International waste movement[edit] *****
While waste transport within a given country falls under national regulations,
trans-boundary_movement_of_waste is often subject to international treaties. A
major concern to many countries in the world has been hazardous_waste. The
Basel_Convention, ratified by 172 countries, deprecates movement of hazardous
waste from developed to less developed countries. The provisions of the Basel
convention have been integrated into the EU waste shipment regulation.
Radioactive_waste, although considered hazardous, does not fall under the
jurisdiction of the Basel Convention.
***** Challenges in developing countries[edit] *****
Areas with developing economies often experience exhausted waste collection
services and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites. The problems are
worsening.[7][page needed] Problems with governance complicate the situation.
Waste management in these countries and cities is an ongoing challenge due to
weak institutions, chronic under-resourcing and rapid urbanization.[7]
[page needed] All of these challenges, along with the lack of understanding of
different factors that contribute to the hierarchy of waste management, affect
the treatment of waste.[34][full_citation_needed]
***** Technologies[edit] *****
Traditionally, the waste management industry has been a late adopter of new
technologies such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, GPS and
integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected
without the use of estimation or manual data entry.[35]
