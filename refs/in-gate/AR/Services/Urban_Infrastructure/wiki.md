Infrastructure is the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country,
city, or other area,[1] including the services and facilities necessary for its
economy to function.[2] Infrastructure is composed of public and private
physical improvements such as roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water_supply,
sewers, electrical_grids, and telecommunications (including Internet
connectivity and broadband_speeds). In general, it has also been defined as
"the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and
services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living_conditions".

There are two general types of ways to view infrastructure, hard or soft. Hard
infrastructure refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of
a modern industry.[4] This includes roads, bridges, railways, etc. Soft
infrastructure refers to all the institutions that maintain the economic,
health, social, and cultural_standards of a country.[4] This includes
educational_programs, official_statistics, parks and recreational facilities,
law_enforcement agencies, and emergency_services.
The word infrastructure has been used in French since 1875 and in English since
1887, originally meaning "The installations that form the basis for any
operation or system".[5][6] The word was imported from French, where it was
already used for establishing a roadbed of substrate material, required before
railroad tracks or constructed pavement could be laid on top of it. The word is
a combination of the Latin prefix "infra", meaning "below" and many of these
constructions are underground, for example, tunnels, water and gas systems, and
railways and the French word "structure" (derived from the Latin word
"structura"). The army use of the term achieved currency in the United States
after the formation of NATO in the 1940s, and by 1970 was adopted by urban
planners in its modern civilian sense.[7]

***** Classifications[edit] *****
A 1987 US_National_Research_Council panel adopted the term "public works
infrastructure", referring to:
     "... both specific functional modes â highways, streets, roads, and
     bridges; mass_transit; airports and airways; water_supply and water
     resources; wastewater_management; solid-waste treatment and disposal;
     electric power_generation and transmission; telecommunications; and
     hazardous waste management â and the combined system these modal
     elements comprise. A comprehension of infrastructure spans not only
     these public works facilities, but also the operating procedures,
     management practices, and development policies that interact together
     with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the
     transport of people and goods, provision of water for drinking and a
     variety of other uses, safe disposal of society's waste products,
     provision of energy where it is needed, and transmission of
     information within and between communities."[8]
The American Society of Civil Engineers publish a "Infrastructure Report Card"
which represents the organizations opinion on the condition of various
infrastructure every 2â4 years.[9] As of 2017[update] they grade 16
categories, namely aviation, bridges, dams, drinking_water, energy, hazardous
waste, inland_waterways, levees, parks & recreation, ports, rail, roads,
schools, solid_waste, transit and wastewater.[9]:4
**** Personal[edit] ****
A way to embody personal infrastructure is to think of it in term of human
capital.[10] Human_capital is defined by the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica as
âintangible collective resources possessed by individuals and groups within a
given population".[11] The goal of personal infrastructure is to determine the
quality of the economic agentsâ values. This results in three major tasks:
the task of economic proxiesâ in the economic process (teachers, unskilled
and qualified labor, etc.); the importance of personal infrastructure for an
individual (short and long-term consumption of education); and the social
relevance of personal infrastructure.[10]
**** Institutional[edit] ****
Institutional infrastructure branches from the term "economic constitution".
According to Gianpiero_Torrisi, Institutional infrastructure is the object of
economic and legal policy. It compromises the grown and sets norms.[10] It
refers to the degree of actual equal treatment of equal economic data and
determines the framework within which economic agents may formulate their own
economic plans and carry them out in co-operation with others.
**** Material[edit] ****
Material infrastructure is defined as âthose immobile, non-circulating
capital goods that essentially contribute to the production of infrastructure
goods and services needed to satisfy basic physical and social requirements of
economic_agents".[10] There are two distinct qualities of material
infrastructures: 1) Fulfillment of social_needs and 2) Mass_production. The
first characteristic deals with the basic needs of human life. The second
characteristic is the non-availability of infrastructure goods and services.
[10]
**** Economic[edit] ****
According to the business dictionary, economic infrastructure can be defined as
"internal facilities of a country that make business activity possible, such as
communication, transportation and distribution_networks, financial_institutions
and markets, and energy_supply systems".[12] Economic infrastructure support
productive activities and events. This includes roads, highways, bridges,
airports, cycling_infrastructure, water_distribution networks, sewer_systems,
irrigation plants, etc.[10]
**** Social[edit] ****
Social infrastructure can be broadly defined as the construction and
maintenance of facilities that support social services.[13] Social
infrastructures are created to increase social comfort and act on economic
activity. These being schools, parks and playgrounds, structures for public
safety, waste disposal plants, hospitals, sports area, etc.[10]
**** Core[edit] ****
Core assets provide essential services and have monopolistic characteristics.
[14] Investors seeking core infrastructure look for five different
characteristics: Income, Low volatility of returns, Diversification, Inflation
Protection, and Long-term liability matching.[14] Core Infrastructure
incorporates all the main types of infrastructure. For instance; roads,
highways, railways, public_transportation, water and gas supply, etc.
**** Basic[edit] ****
Basic infrastructure refers to main railways, roads, canals, harbors and docks,
the electromagnetic telegraph, drainage, dikes, and land reclamation.[10] It
consist of the more well-known features of infrastructure. The things in the
world we come across everyday (buildings, roads, docks, etc.).
**** Complementary[edit] ****
Complementary infrastructure refers to things like light railways, tramways,
gas/electricity/water supply, etc.[10] To complement something, means to bring
to perfection or complete it. So, complementary infrastructure deals with the
little parts of the engineering world the brings more life. The lights on the
sidewalks, the landscaping around buildings, the benches for pedestrians to
rest, etc.
***** Related concepts[edit] *****
The term infrastructure may be confused with the following overlapping or
related concepts.
Land_improvement and land_development are general terms that in some contexts
may include infrastructure, but in the context of a discussion of
infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not
included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single
parcel_of_land, and are owned and operated by the land owner. For example, an
irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with
infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels
would be considered land improvements, not infrastructure. Service connections
to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered land
improvements, not infrastructure.[15][16]
The term public_works includes government-owned and operated infrastructure as
well as public buildings, such as schools and court houses. Public works
generally refers to physical assets needed to deliver public_services. Public
services include both infrastructure and services generally provided by
government.
***** Ownership and financing[edit] *****
Main article: Infrastructure_and_economics
Infrastructure may be owned and managed by governments or by private companies,
such as sole public_utility or railway companies. Generally, most roads, major
airports and other ports, water distribution systems, and sewage networks are
publicly owned, whereas most energy and telecommunications_networks are
privately owned.[citation_needed] Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for
from taxes, tolls, or metered user fees, whereas private infrastructure is
generally paid for by metered user fees.[citation_needed] Major investment
projects are generally financed by the issuance of long-term bonds.[citation
needed]
Government-owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in
the private_sector or in public-private_partnerships, in addition to in the
public_sector. As of 2008[update] in the United States for example, public
spending on infrastructure has varied between 2.3% and 3.6% of GDP since 1950.
[17] Many financial_institutions_invest_in_infrastructure.
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Engineering and construction[edit] ****
Engineers generally limit the term "infrastructure" to describe fixed_assets
that are in the form of a large network; in other words, hard_infrastructure.
[citation_needed] Efforts to devise more generic definitions of infrastructures
have typically referred to the network aspects of most of the structures, and
to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assets.[citation
needed] One such definition from 1998 defined infrastructure as the network of
assets "where the system as a whole is intended to be maintained indefinitely
at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement and
refurbishment of its components".[18]
**** Civil defense and economic development[edit] ****
See also: Civil_defense_by_country
Civil_defense planners and developmental_economists generally refer to both
hard and soft infrastructure, including public_services such as schools and
hospitals, emergency_services such as police and fire fighting, and basic
financial_services. The notion of infrastructure-based_development combining
long-term infrastructure investments by government agencies at central and
regional levels with public_private_partnerships has proven popular among
economists in Asia (notably Singapore and China), mainland Europe, and Latin
America.
**** Military[edit] ****
Military infrastructure is the buildings and permanent installations necessary
for the support of military forces, whether they are stationed in bases, being
deployed or engaged in operations. For example, barracks, headquarters,
airfields, communications facilities, stores of military equipment, port
installations, and maintenance stations.[19]
**** Communications[edit] ****
Communications infrastructure is the informal and formal channels of
communication, political and social_networks, or beliefs held by members of
particular groups, as well as information_technology, software development
tools. Still underlying these more conceptual uses is the idea that
infrastructure provides organizing structure and support for the system or
organization it serves, whether it is a city, a nation, a corporation, or a
collection of people with common interests. Examples include IT_infrastructure,
research infrastructure, terrorist infrastructure, employment infrastructure
and tourism infrastructure.[citation_needed]
***** In the developing world[edit] *****
According to researchers at the Overseas_Development_Institute, the lack of
infrastructure in many developing_countries represents one of the most
significant limitations to economic_growth and achievement of the Millennium
Development_Goals_(MDGs). Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be
very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely
populated countries in Africa. It has been argued that infrastructure
investments contributed to more than half of Africa's improved growth
performance between 1990 and 2005, and increased investment is necessary to
maintain growth and tackle poverty. The returns to investment in infrastructure
are very significant, with on average thirty to forty percent returns for
telecommunications (ICT) investments, over forty percent for electricity
generation, and eighty percent for roads.[20]
**** Regional differences[edit] ****
The demand for infrastructure, both by consumers and by companies is much
higher than the amount invested.[20] There are severe constraints on the supply
side of the provision of infrastructure in Asia.[21] The infrastructure
financing gap between what is invested in Asia-Pacific (around US$48 billion)
and what is needed (US$228 billion) is around US$180 billion every year.[20]
In Latin_America, three percent of GDP (around US$71 billion) would need to be
invested in infrastructure in order to satisfy demand, yet in 2005, for
example, only around two percent was invested leaving a financing gap of
approximately US$24 billion.[20]
In Africa, in order to reach the seven percent annual growth calculated to be
required to meet the MDGs by 2015 would require infrastructure investments of
about fifteen percent of GDP, or around US$93 billion a year. In fragile
states, over thirty-seven percent of GDP would be required.[20]
**** Sources of funding[edit] ****
The source of financing varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are
dominated by government_spending, others by overseas_development_aid_(ODA), and
yet others by private investors.[20] In California, infrastructure financing
districts are established by local governments to pay for physical facilities
and services within a specified area by using property tax increases.[22] In
order to facilitate investment of the private sector in developing countries'
infrastructure markets, it is necessary to design risk-allocation mechanisms
more carefully, given the higher risks of their markets.[23]
The spending money that comes from the government is less than it used to be.
Compared to the global GDP percentages, The United States is tied for second-
to-last place, with an average percentage of 2.4%. This means that the
government spends less money on repairing old infrastructure and or on
infrastructure as a whole.[24]
In Sub-Saharan_Africa, governments spend around US$9.4 billion out of a total
of US$24.9 billion. In irrigation, governments represent almost all spending.
In transport and energy a majority of investment is government spending. In ICT
and water_supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of
capital expenditure. Overall, between them aid, the private sector, and non-
OECD financiers exceed government spending. The private sector spending alone
equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT
infrastructure investments. External financing increased in the 2000s (decade)
and in Africa alone external infrastructure investments increased from US$7
billion in 2002 to US$27 billion in 2009. China, in particular, has emerged as
an important investor.[20]
