The bamboos /bÃƒÂ¦mÃ‹ÂˆbuÃ‹Â/ ([About_this_sound]listen) are evergreen perennial
flowering_plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. The
word "bamboo" comes from the Dutch or Portuguese languages, which probably
borrowed it from Malay.
In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually
hollow and the vascular_bundles in the cross-section are scattered throughout
the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody
xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary_growth wood causes the stems of
monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than
tapering.[3]
Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world,[4] due to a
unique rhizome-dependent system. Certain species of bamboo can grow 910Â mm
(36Â in) within a 24-hour period, at a rate of almost 40Â mm (1.6Â in) an hour (a
growth around 1Â mm every 90 seconds, or 1Â inch every 40 minutes).[5] Giant
bamboos are the largest members of the grass family.
Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South_Asia,
Southeast_Asia and East_Asia, being used for building_materials, as a food
source, and as a versatile raw product. Bamboo has a higher specific
compressive_strength than wood, brick or concrete, and a specific tensile
strength that rivals steel.[6][7]

Bamboos have long been considered the most primitive grasses, mostly because of
the presence of bracteate, indeterminate inflorescences, "pseudospikelets", and
flowers with three lodicules, six stamens, and three stigmata.[9] Following
more recent molecular_phylogenetic research, many tribes and genera of grasses
formerly included in the Bambusoideae are now classified in other subfamilies,
e.g. the Anomochlooideae, the Puelioideae, and the Ehrhartoideae. The subfamily
in its current sense belongs to the BOP_clade of grasses, where it is sister to
the Pooideae (bluegrasses and relatives).[8]
The bamboos comprise three clades classified as tribes, and these strongly
correspond with geographic divisions representing the New World herbaceous
species (Olyreae), tropical woody bamboos (Bambuseae), and temperate woody
bamboos (Arundinarieae). The woody bamboos do not form a monophyletic_group;
instead, the tropical woody and herbaceous bamboos are sister to the temperate
woody bamboos.[1][8] Altogether, more than 1,400 species are placed in 115
genera.[1]

***** Distribution[edit] *****
Worldwide distribution of bamboos
Most bamboo species are native to warm and moist tropical and warm temperate
climates.[10] However, many species are found in diverse climates, ranging from
hot tropical regions to cool mountainous regions and highland cloud_forests. In
the Asia-Pacific_region they occur across East Asia, from north to 50 Ã‚Â°N
latitude in Sakhalin,[11] to south to northern_Australia, and west to India and
the Himalayas. China, Japan, Korea, India and Australia, all have several
endemic populations.[12] They also occur in small numbers in sub-Saharan
Africa, confined to tropical areas, from southern Senegal in the north to
southern Mozambique and Madagascar in the south.[13] In the Americas, bamboo
has a native range from 47 Ã‚Â°S in southern Argentina and the beech forests of
central Chile, through the South American tropical rainforests, to the Andes in
Ecuador near 4,300Â m (14,000Â ft). Bamboo is also native through Central_America
and Mexico, northward into the Southeastern_United_States.[14] Canada and
continental Europe are not known to have any native species of bamboo.[15] As
garden plants, many species grow readily outside these ranges, including most
of Europe and the United States.
Recently, some attempts have been made to grow bamboo on a commercial basis in
the Great_Lakes_region of east-central Africa, especially in Rwanda.[16] In the
United States, several companies are growing, harvesting, and distributing
species such as Phyllostachys_nigra (Henon) and Phyllostachys_edulis (Moso).

***** Ecology[edit] *****
Closeup of bamboo stalk
Bamboo Canopy
The two general patterns for the growth of bamboo are "clumping" (sympodial)
and "running" (monopodial). Clumping bamboo species tend to spread slowly, as
the growth pattern of the rhizomes is to simply expand the root mass gradually,
similar to ornamental grasses. "Running" bamboos, though, need to be controlled
during cultivation because of their potential for aggressive behavior. They
spread mainly through their rhizomes, which can spread widely underground and
send up new culms to break through the surface. Running bamboo species are
highly variable in their tendency to spread; this is related to both the
species and the soil and climate conditions. Some can send out runners of
several metres a year, while others can stay in the same general area for long
periods. If neglected, over time, they can cause problems by moving into
adjacent areas.
Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants on Earth, with reported
growth rates up to 910Â mm (36Â in) in 24 hours.[5] However, the growth rate is
dependent on local soil and climatic conditions, as well as species, and a more
typical growth rate for many commonly cultivated bamboos in temperate climates
is in the range of 30Ã¢Â€Â“100Â mm (1.2Ã¢Â€Â“3.9Â in) per day during the growing
period. Primarily growing in regions of warmer climates during the late
Cretaceous_period, vast fields existed in what is now Asia. Some of the largest
timber bamboo can grow over 30Â m (98Â ft) tall, and be as large as 250Ã¢Â€Â“300Â mm
(10Ã¢Â€Â“12Â in) in diameter. However, the size range for mature bamboo is species-
dependent, with the smallest bamboos reaching only several inches high at
maturity. A typical height range that would cover many of the common bamboos
grown in the United States is 4.5Ã¢Â€Â“12Â m (15Ã¢Â€Â“39Â ft), depending on species.
Anji_County of China, known as the "Town of Bamboo", provides the optimal
climate and soil conditions to grow, harvest, and process some of the most
valued bamboo poles available worldwide.
Unlike all trees, individual bamboo culms emerge from the ground at their full
diameter and grow to their full height in a single growing_season of three to
four months. During this time, each new shoot grows vertically into a culm with
no branching out until the majority of the mature height is reached. Then, the
branches extend from the nodes and leafing out occurs. In the next year, the
pulpy wall of each culm slowly hardens. During the third year, the culm hardens
further. The shoot is now a fully mature culm. Over the next 2Ã¢Â€Â“5 years
(depending on species), fungus begins to form on the outside of the culm, which
eventually penetrates and overcomes the culm.[citation_needed] Around 5Ã¢Â€Â“8
years later (species- and climate-dependent), the fungal growths cause the culm
to collapse and decay. This brief life means culms are ready for harvest and
suitable for use in construction within about three to seven years. Individual
bamboo culms do not get any taller or larger in diameter in subsequent years
than they do in their first year, and they do not replace any growth lost from
pruning or natural breakage. Bamboo has a wide range of hardiness depending on
species and locale. Small or young specimens of an individual species produce
small culms initially. As the clump and its rhizome system mature, taller and
larger culms are produced each year until the plant approaches its particular
species limits of height and diameter.
Many tropical bamboo species die at or near freezing temperatures, while some
of the hardier temperate bamboos can survive temperatures as low as Ã¢ÂˆÂ’29Â Ã‚Â°C
(Ã¢ÂˆÂ’20Â Ã‚Â°F). Some of the hardiest bamboo species can be grown in USDA_plant
hardiness_zone 5, although they typically defoliate and may even lose all
above-ground growth, yet the rhizomes survive and send up shoots again the next
spring. In milder climates, such as USDA zone 7 and above, most bamboo remain
fully leafed out and green year-round.
***** Mass flowering[edit] *****
Further information: Bamboo_blossom
Flowering bamboo
Phyllostachys glauca 'Yunzhu' in flower
Bamboo seeds bunch 03
Bamboos seldom and unpredictably flower, and the frequency of flowering varies
greatly from species to species. Once flowering takes place, a plant declines
and often dies entirely. In fact, many species only flower at intervals as long
as 65 or 120 years. These taxa exhibit mass_flowering (or gregarious
flowering), with all plants in a particular 'cohort' flowering over a several-
year period. Any plant derived through clonal propagation from this cohort will
also flower regardless of whether it has been planted in a different location.
The longest mass flowering interval known is 130 years, and it is for the
species Phyllostachys_bambusoides (Sieb. & Zucc.). In this species, all plants
of the same stock flower at the same time, regardless of differences in
geographic locations or climatic conditions, and then the bamboo dies. The lack
of environmental impact on the time of flowering indicates the presence of some
sort of "alarm clock" in each cell of the plant which signals the diversion of
all energy to flower production and the cessation of vegetative growth.[18]
This mechanism, as well as the evolutionary cause behind it, is still largely a
mystery.
One hypothesis to explain the evolution of this semelparous mass flowering is
the predator satiation hypothesis, which argues that by fruiting at the same
time, a population increases the survival rate of its seeds by flooding the
area with fruit, so even if predators eat their fill, seeds will still be left
over. By having a flowering cycle longer than the lifespan of the rodent
predators, bamboos can regulate animal populations by causing starvation during
the period between flowering events. Thus, the death of the adult clone is due
to resource exhaustion, as it would be more effective for parent plants to
devote all resources to creating a large seed crop than to hold back energy for
their own regeneration.[19]
Another, the fire cycle hypothesis, states that periodic flowering followed by
death of the adult plants has evolved as a mechanism to create disturbance in
the habitat, thus providing the seedlings with a gap in which to grow. This
argues that the dead culms create a large fuel load, and also a large target
for lightning strikes, increasing the likelihood of wildfire.[20] Because
bamboos can be aggressive as early successional plants, the seedlings would be
able to outstrip other plants and take over the space left by their parents.
However, both have been disputed for different reasons. The predator satiation
hypothesis does not explain why the flowering cycle is 10 times longer than the
lifespan of the local rodents, something not predicted. The bamboo fire cycle
hypothesis is considered by a few scientists to be unreasonable; they argue[21]
that fires only result from humans and there is no natural fire in India. This
notion is considered wrong based on distribution of lightning strike data
during the dry season throughout India. However, another argument against this
is the lack of precedent for any living organism to harness something as
unpredictable as lightning strikes to increase its chance of survival as part
of natural evolutionary progress.[22]
More recently, a mathematical explanation for the extreme length of the
flowering cycles has been offered, involving both the stabilizing_selection
implied by the predator satiation hypothesis and others, and the fact that
plants that flower at longer intervals tend to release more seeds.[23][24] The
hypothesis claims that bamboo flowering intervals grew by integer
multiplication. A mutant bamboo plant flowering at a noninteger multiple of its
population's flowering interval would release its seeds alone, and would not
enjoy the benefits of collective flowering (such as protection from predators).
However, a mutant bamboo plant flowering at an integer multiple of its
population's flowering interval would release its seeds only during collective
flowering events, and would release more seeds than the average plant in the
population. It could, therefore, take over the population, establishing a
flowering interval that is an integer multiple of the previous flowering
interval. The hypothesis predicts that observed bamboo flowering intervals
should factorize into small prime_numbers.
The mass fruiting also has direct economic and ecological consequences,
however. The huge increase in available fruit in the forests often causes a
boom in rodent populations, leading to increases in disease and famine in
nearby human populations. For example, devastating consequences occur when the
Melocanna bambusoides population flowers and fruits once every 30Ã¢Â€Â“35 years
[25] around the Bay_of_Bengal. The death of the bamboo plants following their
fruiting means the local people lose their building material, and the large
increase in bamboo fruit leads to a rapid increase in rodent populations. As
the number of rodents increases, they consume all available food, including
grain fields and stored food, sometimes leading to famine. These rats can also
carry dangerous diseases, such as typhus, typhoid, and bubonic_plague, which
can reach epidemic proportions as the rodents increase in number.[18][19] The
relationship between rat populations and bamboo flowering was examined in a
2009 Nova documentary "Rat_Attack".
In any case, flowering produces masses of seeds, typically suspended from the
ends of the branches. These seeds give rise to a new generation of plants that
may be identical in appearance to those that preceded the flowering, or they
may produce new cultivars with different characteristics, such as the presence
or absence of striping or other changes in coloration of the culms.
Several bamboo species are never known to set seed even when sporadically
flowering has been reported. Bambusa_vulgaris, Bambusa_balcooa, and
Dendrocalamus_stocksii are common examples of such bamboo.[26]
***** Animal diet[edit] *****
Bamboo is the main food of the giant_panda, making up 99% of its diet.
Soft bamboo_shoots, stems and leaves are the major food source of the giant
panda of China, the red_panda of Nepal, and the bamboo_lemurs of Madagascar.
Rats eat the fruits as described above. Mountain_gorillas of Central_Africa
also feed on bamboo, and have been documented consuming bamboo sap which was
fermented and alcoholic;[13] chimpanzees and elephants of the region also eat
the stalks.
The larvae of the bamboo_borer (the moth Omphisa_fuscidentalis) of Laos,
Myanmar, Thailand and Yunnan,_China feed off the pulp of live bamboo. In turn,
these caterpillars are considered a local_delicacy.
***** Allergenic potential[edit] *****
Gardeners working with bamboo plants have occasionally reported allergic
reactions varying from no effects during previous exposures, to immediate
itchiness and rash developing into red welts after several hours where the skin
had been in contact with the plant (contact_allergy), and in some cases into
swollen eyelids and breathing difficulties (dyspnoea). A skin_prick_test using
bamboo extract was positive for the immunoglobulin_E_(IgE) in an available case
study.[27][28][29]
***** Cultivation[edit] *****

Although a few species of bamboo are always in flower at any given time,
growing a specific bamboo typically requires obtaining plants as divisions of
already-growing plants, rather than waiting for seeds to be produced.
**** Commercial timber[edit] ****
Timber is harvested from both cultivated and wild stands, and some of the
larger bamboos, particularly species in the genus Phyllostachys, are known as
"timber bamboos".

Bamboo used for construction purposes must be harvested when the culms reach
their greatest strength and when sugar levels in the sap are at their lowest,
as high sugar content increases the ease and rate of pest infestation. As
compared to forest trees, bamboo species grow fast. Bamboo plantations can be
readily harvested for a shorter period than tree plantations.[30]
Harvesting of bamboo is typically undertaken according to these cycles:
1) Lifecycle of the culm: As each individual culm goes through a 5Ã¢Â€Â“ to 7-year
lifecycle, culms are ideally allowed to reach this level of maturity prior to
full capacity harvesting. The clearing out or thinning of culms, particularly
older decaying culms, helps to ensure adequate light and resources for new
growth. Well-maintained clumps may have a productivity three to four times that
of an unharvested wild clump. Consistent with the lifecycle described above,
bamboo is harvested from two to three years through to five to seven years,
depending on the species.
2) Annual cycle: As all growth of new bamboo occurs during the wet_season,
disturbing the clump during this phase will potentially damage the upcoming
crop. Also during this high-rainfall period, sap levels are at their highest,
and then diminish towards the dry_season. Picking immediately prior to the wet/
growth season may also damage new shoots. Hence, harvesting is best a few
months prior to the start of the wet season.
3) Daily cycle: During the height of the day, photosynthesis is at its peak,
producing the highest levels of sugar in sap, making this the least ideal time
of day to harvest. Many traditional practitioners believe the best time to
harvest is at dawn or dusk on a waning moon.
**** Leaching[edit] ****
Leaching is the removal of sap after harvest. In many areas of the world, the
sap levels in harvested bamboo are reduced either through leaching or
postharvest photosynthesis. Examples of this practice include:
   1. Cut bamboo is raised clear of the ground and leaned against the rest of
      the clump for one to two weeks until leaves turn yellow to allow full
      consumption of sugars by the plant.
   2. A similar method is undertaken, but with the base of the culm standing in
      fresh water, either in a large drum or stream to leach out sap.
   3. Cut culms are immersed in a running stream and weighted down for three to
      four weeks.
   4. Water is pumped through the freshly cut culms, forcing out the sap (this
      method is often used in conjunction with the injection of some form of
      treatment).
In the process of water leaching, the bamboo is dried slowly and evenly in the
shade to avoid cracking in the outer skin of the bamboo, thereby reducing
opportunities for pest infestation.
Durability of bamboo in construction is directly related to how well it is
handled from the moment of planting through harvesting, transportation,
storage, design, construction, and maintenance. Bamboo harvested at the correct
time of year and then exposed to ground contact or rain will break down just as
quickly as incorrectly harvested material.[31]
**** Maintenance of spreading runners[edit] ****
Regular observations at ground level indicate major growth directions and
locations of rhizomes. In dry and hard soil conditions extending rhizomes will
cause cracks in the soil surface. To facilitate rhizome maintenance it's best
to dig a furrow around the bamboo planting or plant in a raised mound or
bottomless lumber frame box. During "root pruning" of running bamboo the cut
rhizomes are typically removed; however, rhizomes take a number of months to
mature, and an immature, severed rhizome usually ceases growing if left in-
ground. If any bamboo shoots come up outside of the bamboo area afterwards,
their presence indicates the precise location of the removed rhizome. The
fibrous roots that radiate from the rhizomes do not produce more bamboo.
Bamboo growth can be somewhat controlled by surrounding the plant or grove with
a physical barrier. Typically, steel, concrete, and specially rolled HDPE
plastic are used to create the barrier, which is placed in a 600Ã¢Â€Â“ to 900-
millimetre-deep ditch around the planting and angled out at the top to direct
the rhizomes to the surface; this is only possible if the barrier is installed
in a straight line. Regardless of size of area,[citation_needed] blocking
bamboo rhizomes as a solution to controlling running bamboo is detrimental to
the health of the plant, and only temporary. Bamboo within barriers usually
become rootbound after a few years and start to display the signs of any
unhealthy containerized plant. In addition, rhizomes pile up against the
barrier and often escape over the top or under the bottom. Strong rhizomes and
tools can penetrate plastic easily, so care must be taken. In small areas,
regular root pruning maintenance may be the best method for controlling the
running bamboos. Barriers and edging are unnecessary for clump-forming bamboos,
although these may eventually need to have portions removed if they become too
large.
**** Lucky bamboo[edit] ****
The ornamental plant marketed as "lucky bamboo" is an entirely unrelated plant,
Dracaena_sanderiana. It is a resilient member of the lily family that grows in
the dark, tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia and Africa. "Lucky bamboo" has
long been associated with the Eastern practice of feng_shui. Images of the
plant widely available on the Web are often used to depict bamboo.
**** Invasive species[edit] ****
Phyllostachys species of bamboo are also considered invasive and illegal to
sell or propagate in some areas of the US.[32] On a related note, Japanese
knotweed is sometimes mistaken for a bamboo, but it grows wild and is
considered an invasive species.

Although the shoots (new culms that come out of the ground) of bamboo contain a
toxin taxiphyllin (a cyanogenic glycoside) that produces cyanide in the gut,
proper processing renders them edible. They are used in numerous Asian dishes
and broths, and are available in supermarkets in various sliced forms, in both
fresh and canned versions. The golden_bamboo_lemur ingests many times the
quantity of the taxiphyllin-containing bamboo that would kill a human.
The bamboo shoot in its fermented state forms an important ingredient in
cuisines across the Himalayas. In Assam, India, for example, it is called
khorisa. In Nepal, a delicacy popular across ethnic boundaries consists of
bamboo shoots fermented with turmeric and oil, and cooked with potatoes into a
dish that usually accompanies rice (alu tama (Ã Â¤Â†Ã Â¤Â²Ã Â¥Â Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¾) in
Nepali).
Khao lam (Thai: Ã Â¸Â‚Ã Â¹Â‰Ã Â¸Â²Ã Â¸Â§Ã Â¸Â«Ã Â¸Â¥Ã Â¸Â²Ã Â¸Â¡) is glutinous_rice with sugar and
coconut cream cooked in specially prepared bamboo sections of different
diameters and lengths
In Indonesia, they are sliced thin and then boiled with santan (thick coconut
milk) and spices to make a dish called gulai_rebung. Other recipes using bamboo
shoots are sayur_lodeh (mixed vegetables in coconut milk) and lun pia
(sometimes written lumpia: fried wrapped bamboo shoots with vegetables). The
shoots of some species contain toxins that need to be leached or boiled out
before they can be eaten safely.
Pickled bamboo, used as a condiment, may also be made from the pith of the
young shoots.
The sap of young stalks tapped during the rainy season may be fermented to make
ulanzi (a sweet wine) or simply made into a soft drink. Bamboo leaves are also
used as wrappers for steamed dumplings which usually contains glutinous rice
and other ingredients.
Pickled bamboo shoots (Nepali: Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â®Ã Â¤Â¾ tama) are cooked with black-eyed
beans as a delicacy in Nepal. Many Nepalese restaurants around the world serve
this dish as aloo bodi tama. Fresh bamboo shoots are sliced and pickled with
mustard seeds and turmeric and kept in glass jar in direct sunlight for the
best taste. It is used alongside many dried beans in cooking during winters.
Baby shoots (Nepali: tusa) of a very different variety of bamboo (Nepali:
Ã Â¤Â¨Ã Â¤Â¿Ã Â¤Â—Ã Â¤Â¾Ã Â¤Â²Ã Â¥Â‹ Nigalo) native to Nepal is cooked as a curry in hilly
regions.
In East_Timor, cooking food in bamboo is called tukir.
In Sambalpur, India, the tender shoots are grated into juliennes and fermented
to prepare kardi. The name is derived from the Sanskrit word for bamboo shoot,
karira. This fermented bamboo shoot is used in various culinary preparations,
notably amil, a sour vegetable soup. It is also made into pancakes using rice
flour as a binding agent. The shoots that have turned a little fibrous are
fermented, dried, and ground to sand-sized particles to prepare a garnish known
as hendua. It is also cooked with tender pumpkin leaves to make sag green
leaves.
In Konkani cuisine, the tender shoots (kirlu) are grated and cooked with
crushed jackfruit seeds to prepare kirla sukke.
*** Kitchenware[edit] ***
The empty hollow in the stalks of larger bamboo is often used to cook food in
many Asian cultures. Soups are boiled and rice is cooked in the hollows of
fresh stalks of bamboo directly over a flame. Similarly, steamed tea is
sometimes rammed into bamboo hollows to produce compressed_forms of Pu-erh_tea.
Cooking food in bamboo is said to give the food a subtle but distinctive taste.
In addition, bamboo is frequently used for cooking utensils within many
cultures, and is used in the manufacture of chopsticks. In modern times, some
see bamboo tools as an ecofriendly alternative to other manufactured utensils.

In old times, people in India used hand made pens (known as Kalam) made from
thin bamboo sticks (with diameters of 5Ã¢Â€Â“10Â mm and lengths of 100Ã¢Â€Â“150Â mm) by
simply peeling them on one side and making a nib-like pattern at the end. The
pen would then be dipped in ink for writing.
***** Bambooworking[edit] *****
Bamboo was used by humans for various purposes at a very early time. Categories
of Bambooworking include:
**** Construction[edit] ****

versatility

Workers on bamboo scaffolding
Bamboo, like true wood, is a natural composite_material with a high strength-
to-weight ratio useful for structures.[35]
In its natural form, bamboo as a construction material is traditionally
associated with the cultures of South Asia, East Asia, and the South Pacific,
to some extent in Central and South America, and by extension in the aesthetic
of Tiki_culture. In China and India, bamboo was used to hold up simple
suspension_bridges, either by making cables of split bamboo or twisting whole
culms of sufficiently pliable bamboo together. One such bridge in the area of
Qian-Xian is referenced in writings dating back to 960 AD and may have stood
since as far back as the third century BC, due largely to continuous
maintenance.[citation_needed]
Bamboo has also long been used as scaffolding; the practice has been banned in
China for buildings over six stories, but is still in continuous use for
skyscrapers in Hong Kong.[36] In the Philippines, the nipa_hut is a fairly
typical example of the most basic sort of housing where bamboo is used; the
walls are split and woven bamboo, and bamboo slats and poles may be used as its
support. In Japanese_architecture, bamboo is used primarily as a supplemental
or decorative element in buildings such as fencing, fountains, grates, and
gutters, largely due to the ready abundance of quality timber.[37]
Various structural shapes may be made by training the bamboo to assume them as
it grows. Squared sections of bamboo are created by compressing the growing
stalk within a square form. Arches may similarly be created by forcing the
bamboo's growth into the desired form, costing much less than it would to
obtain the same shape with regular wood timber. More conventional forming
methods, such as the application of heat and pressure, may also be used to
curve or flatten the cut stalks.[38]
Bamboo can be cut and laminated into sheets and planks. This process involves
cutting stalks into thin strips, planing them flat, and boiling and drying the
strips; they are then glued, pressed, and finished.[39] Long used in China and
Japan, entrepreneurs started developing and selling laminated bamboo_flooring
in the West during the mid-1990s;[39] products made from bamboo laminate,
including flooring, cabinetry, furniture, and even decorations, are currently
surging in popularity, transitioning from the boutique market to mainstream
providers such as Home_Depot. The bamboo goods industry (which also includes
small goods, fabric, etc.) is expected to be worth $25 billion by 2012.[40]
[needs_update] The quality of bamboo laminate varies among manufacturers and
varies according to the maturity of the plant from which it was harvested (six
years being considered the optimum); the sturdiest products fulfill their
claims of being up to three times as hard as oak hardwood while others may be
softer than standard hardwood.[39]
Bamboo intended for use in construction should be treated to resist insects and
rot. The most common solution for this purpose is a mixture of borax and boric
acid. Another process involves boiling cut bamboo to remove the starches that
attract insects.[39]
Bamboo pavilion in the Shenzhen Biennale
Bamboo has been used as reinforcement for concrete in those areas where it is
plentiful, though dispute exists over its effectiveness in the various studies
done on the subject. Bamboo does have the necessary strength to fulfil this
function, but untreated bamboo will swell with water absorbed from the
concrete, causing it to crack. Several procedures must be followed to overcome
this shortcoming.[41]
Several institutes, businesses, and universities are researching the use of
bamboo as an ecological construction material. In the United States and France,
it is possible to get houses made entirely of bamboo,[citation_needed] which
are earthquake- and cyclone-resistant and internationally certified. Three ISO
standards are given for bamboo as a construction material.
In parts of India, bamboo is used for drying clothes indoors, both as a rod
high up near the ceiling to hang clothes on, and as a stick wielded with
acquired expert skill to hoist, spread, and to take down the clothes when dry.
It is also commonly used to make ladders, which apart from their normal
function, are also used for carrying bodies in funerals. In Maharashtra, the
bamboo groves and forests are called Veluvana, the name velu for bamboo is most
likely from Sanskrit, while vana means forest.
Bamboo is known as veduru in Telugu. Bamboo poles are also used for picking
ripe fruits from tall trees like papaya, coconut, and mango. Thin bamboo slats
are used for weaving wattles and baskets in South India. In many rural areas,
the wattles are often used as walls for homes, cattle pens, or for constructing
huts.
Furthermore, bamboo is also used to create flagpoles for saffron-coloured,
Hindu religious flags, which can be seen fluttering across India, especially in
Bihar and Uttar_Pradesh, as well as in Guyana and Suriname in South America.
Bamboo was used for the structural members of the India_pavilion at Expo_2010
in Shanghai. The pavilion is the world's largest bamboo dome, about 34Â m
(112Â ft) in diameter, with bamboo beams/members overlaid with a ferro-concrete
slab, waterproofing, copper plate, solar PV panels, a small windmill, and live
plants. A total of 30Â km (19Â mi) of bamboo was used. The dome is supported on
18-m-long steel piles and a series of steel ring beams. The bamboo was treated
with borax and boric acid as a fire retardant and insecticide and bent in the
required shape. The bamboo sections were joined with reinforcement bars and
concrete mortar to achieve the necessary lengths.[42]
**** Textiles[edit] ****
Main article: Bamboo_textiles
Since the fibers of bamboo are very short (less than 3Â mm (0.12Â in)), they are
not usually transformed into yarn by a natural process. The usual process by
which textiles labeled as being made of bamboo are produced uses only rayon
made from the fibers with heavy employment of chemicals. To accomplish this,
the fibers are broken down with chemicals and extruded through mechanical
spinnerets; the chemicals include lye, carbon_disulfide, and strong acids.[39]
Retailers have sold both end products as "bamboo fabric" to cash in on bamboo's
current ecofriendly cachet; however, the Canadian Competition_Bureau[43] and
the US Federal_Trade_Commission,[44] as of mid-2009, are cracking down on the
practice of labeling bamboo rayon as natural bamboo fabric. Under the
guidelines of both agencies, these products must be labeled as rayon with the
optional qualifier "from bamboo".[44]
**** As a writing surface[edit] ****
Further information: Bamboo_and_wooden_slips
Bamboo was in widespread use in early China as a medium for written documents.
The earliest surviving examples of such documents, written in ink on string-
bound bundles of bamboo strips (or "slips"), date from the 5th century BC
during the Warring_States_period. However, references in earlier texts
surviving on other media make it clear that some precursor of these Warring
States period bamboo slips was in use as early as the late Shang period (from
about 1250 BC).
Bamboo or wooden strips were the standard writing material during the early Han
dynasty, and excavated examples have been found in abundance.[45] Subsequently,
paper began to displace bamboo and wooden strips from mainstream uses, and by
the 4th century AD, bamboo slips had been largely abandoned as a medium for
writing in China.
Bamboo fiber has been used to make paper in China since early times. A high-
quality, handmade paper is still produced in small quantities. Coarse bamboo
paper is still used to make spirit_money in many Chinese communities.[46]
Bamboo pulps are mainly produced in China, Myanmar, Thailand, and India, and
are used in printing_and_writing_papers.[47] Several paper industries are
surviving on bamboo forests. Ballarpur (Chandrapur, Maharstra) paper mills use
bamboo for paper production. The most common bamboo species used for paper are
Dendrocalamus_asper and Bambusa_blumeana. It is also possible to make
dissolving_pulp from bamboo. The average fiber length is similar to hardwoods,
but the properties of bamboo pulp are closer to softwood pulps due to it having
a very broad fiber length distribution.[47] With the help of molecular tools,
it is now possible to distinguish the superior fiber-yielding species/varieties
even at juvenile stages of their growth, which can help in unadulterated
merchandise production.[48]
**** Weapons[edit] ****
Bamboo has often been used to construct weapons and is still incorporated in
several Asian martial arts.
    * A bamboo staff, sometimes with one end sharpened, is used in the Tamil
      martial art of silambam, a word derived from a term meaning "hill
      bamboo".
    * Staves used in the Indian martial art of gatka are commonly made from
      bamboo, a material favoured for its light weight.
    * A bamboo sword called a shinai is used in the Japanese martial art of
      kendo.
    * Bamboo is used for crafting the bows, called yumi, and arrows used in the
      Japanese martial art kyudo.
    * Bamboo is sometimes used to craft the limbs of the longbow and recurve
      bow used in traditional archery, and to make superior weapons for
      bowhunting and target_archery.
    * The first gunpowder-based weapons, such as the fire_lance, were made of
      bamboo.
    * Bamboo was apparently used in East and South Asia as a means_of_torture.

**** Other uses[edit] ****
Bamboo is extensively used for fishing and aquaculture applications on the Dayu
Bay in Cangnan_County, Zhejiang
Bamboo brooms.
Bamboo is used for mussels breeding and propagation (Abucay,_Bataan,
Philippines).
Bamboo has traditionally been used to make a wide range of everyday utensils
and cutting_boards, particularly in Japan,[49] where archaeological excavations
have uncovered bamboo baskets dating to the Late JÃ…Âmon period (2000Ã¢Â€Â“1000
BC).[50]
Bamboo has a long history of use in Asian_furniture. Chinese_bamboo_furniture
is a distinct style based on a millennia-long tradition, and bamboo is also
used for floors due to its high hardness.[51]
Several manufacturers offer bamboo_bicycles, surfboards, snowboards, and
skateboards.[52][53]
Due to its flexibility, bamboo is also used to make fishing_rods. The split
cane_rod is especially prized for fly_fishing. Bamboo has been traditionally
used in Malaysia as a firecracker called a meriam buluh or bamboo_cannon. Four-
foot-long sections of bamboo are cut, and a mixture of water and calcium
carbide are introduced. The resulting acetylene gas is ignited with a stick,
producing a loud bang. Bamboo can be used in water_desalination. A bamboo
filter is used to remove the salt from seawater[dubious  â€“ discuss].[54]
Many ethnic groups in remote areas that have water access in Asia use bamboo
that is 3Ã¢Â€Â“5 years old to make rafts. They use 8 to 12 poles, 6Ã¢Â€Â“7Â m
(20Ã¢Â€Â“23Â ft) long, laid together side by side to a width of about 1Â m (3.3Â ft).
Once the poles are lined up together, they cut a hole crosswise through the
poles at each end and use a small bamboo pole pushed through that hole like a
screw to hold all the long bamboo poles together. Floating houses use whole
bamboo stalks tied together in a big bunch to support the house floating in the
water. Bamboo is also used to make eating utensils such as chopsticks, trays,
and tea scoops.
The Song_Dynasty (960Ã¢Â€Â“1279 AD) Chinese scientist and polymath Shen_Kuo
(1031Ã¢Â€Â“1095) used the evidence of underground petrified bamboo found in the
dry northern climate of Yan'an, Shanbei region, Shaanxi province to support his
geological theory of gradual climate_change.[55][56]
***** Symbolism and culture[edit] *****
Bamboo, by Xu_Wei, Ming_Dynasty.
Bamboo's long life makes it a Chinese symbol of uprightness and an Indian
symbol of friendship. The rarity of its blossoming has led to the flowers'
being regarded as a sign of impending famine. This may be due to rats feeding
upon the profusion of flowers, then multiplying and destroying a large part of
the local food supply. The most recent flowering began in May 2006 (see
Mautam). Bamboo is said to bloom in this manner only about every 50 years (see
28Ã¢Â€Â“60 year examples in FAO:_'gregarious'_species_table).
In Chinese_culture, the bamboo, plum blossom, orchid, and chrysanthemum (often
known as mÃƒÂ©i lÃƒÂ¡n zhÃƒÂº jÃƒÂº Ã¦Â¢Â…Ã¥Â…Â°Ã§Â«Â¹Ã¨ÂÂŠ) are collectively referred to as the
Four_Gentlemen. These four plants also represent the four seasons and, in
Confucian ideology, four aspects of the junzi ("prince" or "noble one"). The
pine (sÃ…Âng Ã¦ÂÂ¾), the bamboo (zhÃƒÂº Ã§Â«Â¹), and the plum blossom (mÃƒÂ©i Ã¦Â¢Â…) are
also admired for their perseverance under harsh conditions, and are together
known as the "Three_Friends_of_Winter" (Ã¥Â²ÂÃ¥Â¯Â’Ã¤Â¸Â‰Ã¥ÂÂ‹ suÃƒÂ¬hÃƒÂ¡n sÃ„ÂnyÃ‡Â’u) in
Chinese culture. The "Three Friends of Winter" is traditionally used as a
system of ranking in Japan, for example in sushi sets or accommodations at a
traditional ryokan. Pine (matsu Ã¦ÂÂ¾) is of the first rank, bamboo (take Ã§Â«Â¹) is
of second rank, and plum (ume Ã¦Â¢Â…) is of the third.
The Bozo ethnic group of West Africa take their name from the Bambara phrase
bo-so, which means "bamboo house". Bamboo is also the national plant of St.
Lucia.

Bamboo, one of the "Four_Gentlemen" (bamboo, orchid, plum blossom and
chrysanthemum), plays such an important role in traditional Chinese culture
that it is even regarded as a behavior model of the gentleman. As bamboo has
features such as uprightness, tenacity, and modesty, people endow bamboo with
integrity, elegance, and plainness, though it is not physically strong.
Countless poems praising bamboo written by ancient Chinese poets are actually
metaphorically about people who exhibited these characteristics. An ancient
poet, Bai_Juyi (772Ã¢Â€Â“846), thought that to be a gentleman, a man does not need
to be physically strong, but he must be mentally strong, upright, and
perseverant. Just as a bamboo is hollow-hearted, he should open his heart to
accept anything of benefit and never have arrogance or prejudice.
Bamboo is not only a symbol of a gentleman, but also plays an important role in
Buddhism, which was introduced into China in the first century. As canons of
Buddhism forbids cruelty to animals, flesh and egg were not allowed in the
diet. The tender bamboo shoot (sÃ‡Â”nÃ§Â­Â in Chinese) thus became a nutritious
alternative. Preparation methods developed over thousands of years have come to
be incorporated into Asian cuisines, especially for monks. A Buddhist monk, Zan
Ning, wrote a manual of the bamboo shoot called "SÃ‡Â”n PÃ‡Â”Ã§Â­ÂÃ¨Â­Âœ" offering
descriptions and recipes for many kinds of bamboo shoots.[57] Bamboo shoot has
always been a traditional dish on the Chinese dinner table, especially in
southern China. In ancient times, those who could afford a big house with a
yard would plant bamboo in their garden.
In Japan, a bamboo forest sometimes surrounds a Shinto shrine as part of a
sacred barrier against evil. Many Buddhist temples also have bamboo groves.

Zhang Xihuang in the 17th century, late Ming or early Qing Dynasty Ã¢Â€Â“ in the
calligraphy of Zhang's style, the poem Returning to My Farm in the Field by the
fourth-century poet Tao_Yuanming is incised on the holder.

Bamboo plays an important part of the culture_of_Vietnam. Bamboo symbolizes the
spirit of Vovinam (a Vietnamese martial arts): cÃ†Â°Ã†Â¡ng nhu phÃ¡Â»Â‘i triÃ¡Â»Âƒn
(coordination between hard_and_soft_(martial_arts)). Bamboo also symbolizes the
Vietnamese hometown and Vietnamese soul: the gentlemanlike,
straightforwardness, hard working, optimism, unity, and adaptability. A
Vietnamese proverb says, "Tre giÃƒÂ , mÃ„Âƒng mÃ¡Â»Âc" (When the bamboo is old, the
bamboo sprouts appear), the meaning being Vietnam will never be annihilated; if
the previous generation dies, the children take their place. Therefore, the
Vietnam nation and Vietnamese value will be maintained and developed eternally.
Traditional Vietnamese villages are surrounded by thick bamboo hedges (lÃ…Â©y
tre).
**** In mythology[edit] ****
Several Asian cultures, including that of the Andaman_Islands, believe humanity
emerged from a bamboo stem.
In Philippine_mythology, one of the more famous creation_accounts tells of the
first man, MalakÃƒÂ¡s ("Strong"), and the first woman, Maganda ("Beautiful"),
each emerged from one half of a split bamboo stem on an island formed after the
battle between Sky and Ocean. In Malaysia, a similar story includes a man who
dreams of a beautiful woman while sleeping under a bamboo plant; he wakes up
and breaks the bamboo stem, discovering the woman inside. The Japanese_folktale
"Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter" (Taketori Monogatari) tells of a princess from the
Moon emerging from a shining bamboo section. Hawaiian bamboo ('ohe) is a
kinolau or body form of the Polynesian creator god KÃ„Âne.
A bamboo cane is also the weapon of Vietnamese legendary hero, ThÃƒÂ¡nh_GiÃƒÂ³ng,
who had grown up immediately and magically since the age of three because of
his wish to liberate his land from ÃƒÂ‚n invaders. An ancient Vietnamese legend
(The_Hundred-knot_Bamboo_Tree) tells of a poor, young farmer who fell in love
with his landlord's beautiful daughter. The farmer asked the landlord for his
daughter's hand in marriage, but the proud landlord would not allow her to be
bound in marriage to a poor farmer. The landlord decided to foil the marriage
with an impossible deal; the farmer must bring him a "bamboo tree of 100
nodes". But Gautama_Buddha (BÃ¡Â»Â¥t) appeared to the farmer and told him that
such a tree could be made from 100 nodes from several different trees. BÃ¡Â»Â¥t
gave to him four magic words to attach the many nodes of bamboo: KhÃ¡ÂºÂ¯c nhÃ¡ÂºÂ­p,
khÃ¡ÂºÂ¯c xuÃ¡ÂºÂ¥t, which means "joined together immediately, fell apart
immediately". The triumphant farmer returned to the landlord and demanded his
daughter. Curious to see such a long bamboo, the landlord was magically joined
to the bamboo when he touched it, as the young farmer said the first two magic
words. The story ends with the happy marriage of the farmer and the landlord's
daughter after the landlord agreed to the marriage and asked to be separated
from the bamboo.
In a Chinese legend, the Emperor_Yao gave two of his daughters to the future
Emperor_Shun as a test for his potential to rule. Shun passed the test of being
able to run his household with the two emperor's daughters as wives, and thus
Yao made Shun his successor, bypassing his unworthy son. After Shun's death,
the tears of his two bereaved wives fell upon the bamboos growing there
explains the origin of spotted_bamboo. The two women later became goddesses
Xiangshuishen after drowning themselves in the Xiang_River.
