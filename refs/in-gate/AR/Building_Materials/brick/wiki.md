A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements
in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit
composed of clay, but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-
bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks can be joined
together using mortar, adhesives or by interlocking them.[1][2] Bricks are
produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with
region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic
categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks.
Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of
similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also
called lightweight blocks) are made from expanded_clay_aggregate.
Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building_materials,
sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000
BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as mudbricks, have a history older than fired
bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.
Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds, collectively
known as brickwork, and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the
bricks together to make a durable structure.

***** History *****

**** Middle East and South Asia ****

The ancient Jetavanaramaya stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri_Lanka is one of the
largest brick structures in the world.
The earliest bricks were dried brick, meaning that they were formed from clay-
bearing earth or mud and dried (usually in the sun) until they were strong
enough for use. The oldest discovered bricks, originally made from shaped mud
and dating before 7500 BC, were found at Tell_Aswad, in the upper Tigris region
and in southeast Anatolia close to Diyarbakir.[3] The South_Asian inhabitants
of Mehrgarh also constructed, and lived in, air-dried mudbrick houses between
7000Ã¢Â€Â“3300 BC.[4] Other more recent findings, dated between 7,000 and 6,395
BC, come from Jericho, Catal_HÃƒÂ¼yÃƒÂ¼k, the ancient Egyptian fortress of Buhen,
and the ancient Indus_Valley cities of Mohenjo-daro, Harappa,[5] and Mehrgarh.
[6] Ceramic, or fired brick was used as early as 3000 BC in early Indus Valley
cities like Kalibangan.[7]
**** China ****
The earliest fired bricks appeared in Neolithic China around 4400 BC at
Chengtoushan, a walled settlement of the Daxi_culture.[8] These bricks were
made of red clay, fired on all sides to above 600Â Ã‚Â°C, and used as flooring for
houses. By the Qujialing_period (3300 BC), fired bricks were being used to pave
roads and as building foundations at Chengtoushan.[9]
Bricks continued to be used during 2nd millennium BC at a site near Xi'an.[10]
Fired bricks were found in Western_Zhou (1046Ã¢Â€Â“771 BC) ruins, where they were
produced on a large scale.[11][12][13] The carpenter's manual Yingzao_Fashi,
published in 1103 at the time of the Song_dynasty described the brick making
process and glazing techniques then in use. Using the 17th-century
encyclopaedic text Tiangong_Kaiwu, historian Timothy_Brook outlined the brick
production process of Ming_Dynasty China:
     ...the kilnmaster had to make sure that the temperature inside the
     kiln stayed at a level that caused the clay to shimmer with the
     colour of molten gold or silver. He also had to know when to quench
     the kiln with water so as to produce the surface glaze. To anonymous
     labourers fell the less skilled stages of brick production: mixing
     clay and water, driving oxen over the mixture to trample it into a
     thick paste, scooping the paste into standardised wooden frames (to
     produce a brick roughly 42Â cm long, 20Â cm wide, and 10Â cm thick),
     smoothing the surfaces with a wire-strung bow, removing them from the
     frames, printing the fronts and backs with stamps that indicated
     where the bricks came from and who made them, loading the kilns with
     fuel (likelier wood than coal), stacking the bricks in the kiln,
     removing them to cool while the kilns were still hot, and bundling
     them into pallets for transportation. It was hot, filthy work.
**** Europe ****

Early civilisations around the Mediterranean adopted the use of fired bricks,
including the Ancient_Greeks and Romans. The Roman_legions operated mobile
kilns,[14] and built large brick structures throughout the Roman_Empire,
stamping the bricks with the seal of the legion.
During the Early_Middle_Ages the use of bricks in construction became popular
in Northern_Europe, after being introduced there from Northern-Western Italy.
An independent style of brick architecture, known as brick_Gothic (similar to
Gothic_architecture) flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of
rocks. Examples of this architectural style can be found in modern-day Denmark,
Germany, Poland, and Russia.
This style evolved into Brick_Renaissance as the stylistic changes associated
with the Italian_Renaissance spread to northern Europe, leading to the adoption
of Renaissance elements into brick building. A clear distinction between the
two styles only developed at the transition to Baroque_architecture. In
LÃƒÂ¼beck, for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings
equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von DÃƒÂ¼ren, who was also
active at Schwerin (Schwerin_Castle) and Wismar (FÃƒÂ¼rstenhof).
Long-distance bulk_transport of bricks and other construction equipment
remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation
infrastructure, with the construction of canal, roads, and railways.
**** Industrial era ****
Production of bricks increased massively with the onset of the Industrial
Revolution and the rise in factory building in England. For reasons of speed
and economy, bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone,
even in areas where the stone was readily available. It was at this time in
London that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings
more visible in the heavy fog and to help prevent traffic accidents.[15]
The transition from the traditional method of production known as hand-moulding
to a mechanised form of mass-production slowly took place during the first half
of the nineteenth century. Possibly the first successful brick-making machine
was patented by Henry Clayton, employed at the Atlas Works in Middlesex,
England, in 1855, and was capable of producing up to 25,000 bricks daily with
minimal supervision.[16] His mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread
attention after it was adopted for use by the South_Eastern_Railway_Company for
brick-making at their factory near Folkestone.[17] The Bradley_&_Craven_Ltd
Ã¢Â€Â˜Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking MachineÃ¢Â€Â™ was patented in 1853, apparently
predating Clayton. Bradley & Craven went on to be a dominant manufacturer of
brickmaking machinery.[18] Predating both Clayton and Bradley & Craven Ltd.
however was the brick making machine patented by Richard A. Ver Valen of
Haverstraw, New York in 1852.[19]
The demand for high office building construction at the turn of the 20th
century led to a much greater use of cast and wrought_iron, and later, steel
and concrete. The use of brick for skyscraper construction severely limited the
size of the building Ã¢Â€Â“ the Monadnock_Building, built in 1896 in Chicago,
required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its
17 storeys.
Following pioneering work in the 1950s at the Swiss_Federal_Institute_of
Technology and the Building_Research_Establishment in Watford, UK, the use of
improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high
was made viable. However, the use of brick has largely remained restricted to
small to medium-sized buildings, as steel and concrete remain superior
materials for high-rise construction.[20]

***** Methods of manufacture *****
Brick making at the beginning of the 20th century
Three basic types of brick are un-fired, fired, and chemically set bricks. Each
type is manufactured differently.
**** Mudbrick ****
Main article: Mudbrick
Unfired bricks, also known as mudbricks, are made from a wet, clay-containing
soil mixed with straw or similar binders. They are air-dried until ready for
use.
**** Fired brick ****
Raw bricks sun-drying before being fired
Fired bricks are burned in a kiln which makes them durable. Modern, fired, clay
bricks are formed in one of three processes Ã¢Â€Â“ soft mud, dry press, or
extruded. Depending on the country, either the extruded or soft mud method is
the most common, since they are the most economical.
Normally, bricks contain the following ingredients:[21]
   1. Silica (sand) Ã¢Â€Â“ 50% to 60% by weight
   2. Alumina (clay) Ã¢Â€Â“ 20% to 30% by weight
   3. Lime Ã¢Â€Â“ 2 to 5% by weight
   4. Iron oxide Ã¢Â€Â“ Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 7% by weight
   5. Magnesia Ã¢Â€Â“ less than 1% by weight
*** Shaping methods ***
Three main methods are used for shaping the raw materials into bricks to be
fired:
    * Molded bricks Ã¢Â€Â“ These bricks start with raw clay, preferably in a mix
      with 25Ã¢Â€Â“30% sand to reduce shrinkage. The clay is first ground and
      mixed with water to the desired consistency. The clay is then pressed
      into steel moulds with a hydraulic press. The shaped clay is then fired
      ("burned") at 900Ã¢Â€Â“1000Â Ã‚Â°C to achieve strength.
    * Dry-pressed bricks Ã¢Â€Â“ The dry-press method is similar to the soft-mud
      moulded method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more
      accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the
      longer burn make this method more expensive.
    * Extruded bricks Ã¢Â€Â“ For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10Ã¢Â€Â“15%
      water (stiff extrusion) or 20Ã¢Â€Â“25% water (soft extrusion) in a pugmill.
      This mixture is forced through a die to create a long cable of material
      of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the
      desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by
      this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can
      produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the
      volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and
      easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid
      bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to
      150Â Ã‚Â°C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from
      the kiln.
*** Kilns ***
Raw (green) Indian brick

A brickmaker in India Ã¢Â€Â“ Tashrih al-aqvam (1825)
In many modern brickworks, bricks are usually fired in a continuously fired
tunnel kiln, in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln
on conveyors, rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick
product. The bricks often have lime, ash, and organic matter added, which
accelerates the burning process.
The other major kiln type is the Bull's Trench Kiln (BTK), based on a design
developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.
An oval or circular trench is dug, 6Ã¢Â€Â“9 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and
100Ã¢Â€Â“150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the
centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with "green" (unfired) bricks
which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is
capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.
In operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one
end of the brick pile. Historically, a stack of unfired bricks covered for
protection from the weather was called a "hack".[22] Cooled finished bricks are
removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle,
the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, wood, oil,
debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.
The advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared
with clamp or scove_kilns. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow
through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently
burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air
continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and
finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction that pulls air
through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.
As with the rail process, the BTK process is continuous. A half-dozen labourers
working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000Ã¢Â€Â“25,000 bricks a day.
Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead,
the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually
rotate through the trench.[23]
*** Influences on colour ***
Yellow London Stocks at Waterloo_station
The fired colour of tired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral
content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the
kiln. For example, pink bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or
yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues;
as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple, and
then to brown or grey at around 1,300Â Ã‚Â°C (2,372Â Ã‚Â°F). The names of bricks may
reflect their origin and colour, such as London_stock_brick and Cambridgeshire
White. Brick tinting may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend-
in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.
An impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by salt
glazing, in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a
slip, which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent
reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the
brick base.
**** Chemically set bricks ****
Chemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated
by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave.
*** Calcium-silicate bricks ***
Swedish Mexitegel is a sand-lime or lime-cement brick.
Calcium-silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks, depending
on their ingredients. Rather than being made with clay they are made with lime
binding the silicate material. The raw materials for calcium-silicate bricks
include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand, quartz, crushed
flint, or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral colourants. The
materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated; the mixture
is then pressed into moulds and cured in an autoclave for three to fourteen
hours to speed the chemical hardening.[24] The finished bricks are very
accurate and uniform, although the sharp arrises need careful handling to avoid
damage to brick and bricklayer. The bricks can be made in a variety of colours;
white, black, buff, and grey-blues are common, and pastel shades can be
achieved. This type of brick is common in Sweden, especially in houses built or
renovated in the 1970s. In India these are known as fly_ash_bricks,
manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime, and gypsum) process. Calcium-
silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet
the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 Ã¢Â€Â“ 10 Standard Specification for Calcium
Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick).
*** Concrete bricks ***
Main article: Concrete_masonry_unit
A concrete brick-making assembly line in Guilinyang Town, Hainan, China. This
operation produces a pallet containing 42 bricks, approximately every 30
seconds.
Bricks formed from concrete are usually termed as blocks or concrete_masonry
unit, and are typically pale grey. They are made from a dry, small aggregate
concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either
an "egglayer" or static machine. The finished blocks are cured, rather than
fired, using low-pressure steam. Concrete bricks and blocks are manufactured in
a wide range of shapes, sizes and face treatments Ã¢Â€Â“ a number of which
simulate the appearance of clay bricks.
Concrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made
with sulfate-resisting Portland cement or equivalent. When made with adequate
amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet
conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3 or
ASTM C55. Concrete bricks contract or shrink so they need movement joints every
5 to 6 metres, but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal
and sound resistance and fire resistance.[24]
**** Compressed earth blocks ****
A brick kiln in India
Main article: Compressed_earth_block
Compressed_earth_blocks are made mostly from slightly moistened local soils
compressed with a mechanical hydraulic press or manual lever press. A small
amount of a cement binder may be added, resulting in a stabilised compressed
earth block.
***** Optimal dimensions, characteristics, and strength *****
Comparison of typical brick sizes of assorted countries with isometric
projections with dimensions in mm
Loose bricks
For efficient handling and laying, bricks must be small enough and light enough
to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free
for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective
limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be
spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches
(about 100Â mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is twice its width plus
the width of a mortar joint, about eight inches (about 200Â mm) or slightly
more. This allows bricks to be laid bonded in a structure which increases
stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in
English bond, at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating
courses of stretchers, bricks laid longways, and headers, bricks laid
crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall
is built in a variation of English bond called English cross bond where the
successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by
half a brick length. In true English bond, the perpendicular lines of the
stretcher courses are in line with each other.
A bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall.
Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates
(see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table
below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer
regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the Green_Gate in
Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported Dutch_brick, too small for the colder climate
of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays
this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialised
insulation materials.
The correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour, surface
texture, density, weight, absorption, and pore structure, thermal
characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.

In England, the length and width of the common brick has remained fairly
constant over the centuries (but see brick_tax), but the depth has varied from
about two inches (about 51Â mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a
half inches (about 64Â mm) more recently. In the United_Kingdom, the usual size
of a modern brick is 215 ÃƒÂ— 102.5 ÃƒÂ— 65Â mm (about &#x200b;8Â 5â„8 ÃƒÂ—
&#x200b;4Â 1â„8 ÃƒÂ— &#x200b;2Â 5â„8Â inches), which, with a nominal 10Â mm
(&#x200b;3â„8Â inch) mortar joint, forms a unit_size of 225 ÃƒÂ— 112.5 ÃƒÂ— 75Â mm (9
ÃƒÂ— &#x200b;4Â 1â„2 ÃƒÂ— 3Â inches), for a ratio of 6:3:2.
In the United States, modern standard bricks are specified for various uses;
[25] most are sized at about 8 ÃƒÂ— &#x200b;3Â 5â„8Â  ÃƒÂ— &#x200b;2Â 1â„4Â inches (203
ÃƒÂ— 92 ÃƒÂ— 57Â mm). The more commonly used is the modular brick &#x200b;7Â 5â„8Â  ÃƒÂ—
&#x200b;3Â 5â„8Â  ÃƒÂ— &#x200b;2Â 1â„4Â inches (194 ÃƒÂ— 92 ÃƒÂ— 57Â mm). This modular brick
of &#x200b;7Â 5â„8 with a &#x200b;3â„8 mortar joint eases the calculation of the
number of bricks in a given wall.[26]
Some brickmakers create innovative sizes and shapes for bricks used for
plastering (and therefore not visible on the inside of the building) where
their inherent mechanical properties are more important than their visual ones.
[27] These bricks are usually slightly larger, but not as large as blocks and
offer the following advantages:
    * A slightly larger brick requires less mortar and handling (fewer bricks),
      which reduces cost
    * Their ribbed exterior aids plastering
    * More complex interior cavities allow improved insulation, while
      maintaining strength.
Blocks have a much greater range of sizes. Standard co-ordinating sizes in
length and height (in mm) include 400ÃƒÂ—200, 450ÃƒÂ—150, 450ÃƒÂ—200, 450ÃƒÂ—225,
450ÃƒÂ—300, 600ÃƒÂ—150, 600ÃƒÂ—200, and 600ÃƒÂ—225; depths (work size, mm) include 60,
75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this
range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is
around 2000Â kg/mÃ‚Â³: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on, but
aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the
range of 450Ã¢Â€Â“850Â kg/mÃ‚Â³.
Bricks may also be classified as solid (less than 25% perforations by volume,
although the brick may be "frogged," having indentations on one of the longer
faces), perforated (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick,
removing no more than 25% of the volume), cellular (containing a pattern of
holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or hollow
(containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's
volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow
The term "frog" can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it.
Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of
wood.

The compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from
about 1000Â lbf/inÃ‚Â² to 15,000Â lbf/inÃ‚Â² (7 to 105 MPa or N/mmÃ‚Â² ), varying
according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks
can have strengths of up to 100 MPa, although a common house brick is likely to
show a range of 20Ã¢Â€Â“40 MPa.
***** Use *****
In the United States, bricks have been used for both buildings and pavements.
Examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and
other notable structures around the country. Bricks have been used in pavements
especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The
introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements, but it
is used as a method of traffic_calming or as a decorative surface in pedestrian
precincts. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of
Grand_Rapids, Michigan, were paved with bricks. Today, there are only about 20
blocks of brick-paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all
the streets in the city limits).[28] Much like in Grand Rapids, municipalities
across the United States began replacing brick streets with inexpensive asphalt
concrete by the mid-20th century.[29]
Bricks in the metallurgy and glass industries are often used for lining
furnaces, in particular refractory bricks such as silica, magnesia, chamotte
and neutral (chromomagnesite) refractory_bricks. This type of brick must have
good thermal_shock resistance, refractoriness under load, high melting point,
and satisfactory porosity. There is a large refractory brick_industry,
especially in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Belgium and the
Netherlands.
In Northwest Europe, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until
recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although
many houses are now built using a mixture of concrete_blocks and other
materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for
aesthetic appeal.
Engineering_bricks are used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue
gas) resistance are needed.
In the UK a red_brick_university is one founded in the late 19th or early 20th
century. The term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to
distinguish them from the older Oxbridge institutions, and refers to the use of
bricks, as opposed to stone, in their buildings.
Colombian architect Rogelio_Salmona was noted for his extensive use of red
bricks in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial
geometry and curves in his designs.[30] Most buildings in Colombia are made of
brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.
***** Limitations *****
Starting in the 20th century, the use of brickwork declined in some areas due
to concerns with earthquakes. Earthquakes such as the San_Francisco_earthquake
of_1906 and the 1933_Long_Beach_earthquake revealed the weaknesses of
unreinforced brick masonry in earthquake-prone areas. During seismic events,
the mortar cracks and crumbles, and the bricks are no longer held together.
Brick masonry with steel reinforcement, which helps hold the masonry together
during earthquakes, was used to replace many of the unreinforced masonry
buildings. Retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated
in many jurisdictions.
