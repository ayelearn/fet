The Heliotrope rotates around itself to track the Sun.
Solar architecture is an architectural approach that takes in account the Sun
to harness clean and renewable solar_power. It is related to the fields of
optics, thermics, electronics and materials_science. Both active and passive
solar housing skills are involved in solar architecture.
The use of flexible thin-film photovoltaic_modules provides fluid integration
with steel roofing profiles, enhancing the building's design. Orienting a
building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal_mass or light
dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air also
constitute solar architecture.
Initial development of solar architecture has been limited by the rigidity and
weight of standard solar power panels. The continued development of
photovoltaic (PV) thin film solar has provided a lightweight yet robust vehicle
to harness solar_energy to reduce a building's impact on the environment.

***** History[edit] *****
The idea of passive_solar_building_design first appeared in Greece around the
fifth century BC. Up until that time, the Greeks' main source of fuel had been
charcoal, but due to a major shortage of wood to burn they were forced to find
a new way of heating their dwellings.[1] With necessity as their motivation,
the Greeks revolutionized the design of their cities. They began using building
materials that absorbed solar energy, mostly stone, and started orienting the
buildings so that they faced south. These revolutions, coupled with overhangs
that kept out the hot summer sun, created structures which required very little
heating and cooling. Socrates wrote, "In houses that look toward the south, the
sun penetrates the portico in winter, while in summer the path of the sun is
right over our heads and above the roof so that there is shade."[2]
From this point on, most civilizations have oriented their structures to
provide shade in the summer and heating in the winter. The Romans improved on
the Greeks' design by covering the southern-facing windows with different types
of transparent materials.[1]
Another simpler example of early solar architecture is the cave dwellings in
the southwestern regions of North America. Much like the Greek and Roman
buildings, the cliffs in which the indigenous_people of this region built their
homes were oriented towards the south with an overhang to shade them from the
midday sun during the summer months and capture as much of the solar energy
during the winter as possible.[3]
Active solar architecture involves the moving of heat and/or coolness between a
temporary heat storage medium and a building, typically in response to a
thermostat's call for heat or coolness within the building. While this
principle sounds useful in theory, significant engineering problems have
thwarted almost all active solar architecture in practice. The most common form
of active solar architecture, rock bed storage with air as a heat transfer
medium, usually grew toxic mold in the rock bed which was blown into houses,
along with dust and radon in some cases.
A more complex and modern incarnation of solar architecture was introduced in
1954 with the invention of the photovoltaic_cell by Bell_Labs. Early cells were
extremely inefficient and therefore not widely used, but throughout the years
government and private research has improved the efficiency to a point where it
is now a viable source of energy.
Universities were some of the first buildings to embrace the idea of solar
energy. In 1973, the University_of_Delaware built Solar One, which was one of
the world's first solar-powered houses.
As photovoltaic technologies keep advancing, solar architecture becomes easier
to accomplish. In 1998 Subhendu Guha developed photovoltaic shingles, and
recently[when?] a company called Oxford Photovoltaics has developed perovskite
solar cells that are thin enough to incorporate into windows.[4] Although the
windows are not scaled to a size that can be taken advantage of on a commercial
level yet, the company believes that the outlook is promising. In the
companyâs mission statement they state, "Moreover, through the deployment of
solar cells in areas where solar has traditionally struggled, for example the
glass faÃ§ades of high-rise commercial or residential buildings. In both cases,
allowing solar energy to contribute a much higher proportion of electricity
than is possible today, and helping to position PV as a significant factor in
the global energy market."[5]
***** Elements[edit] *****
**** Greenhouse[edit] ****
Greenhouse in Canada
A greenhouse keeps heat from the Sun. In a double glazed greenhouse, three
effects occur: no convection (air blocking), ray keeping (the ground absorbs a
photon, emits it with lower infrared energy, and the glass reflects this
infrared to the ground), and little conduction (double glazing). It seems that
the convection effect is the most important, as greenhouses in poor countries
are made of plastic.
The greenhouse can be used to grow plants in the winter, to grow tropical
plants, as a terrarium for reptiles or insects, or simply for air comfort. It
must be ventilated, but not too much, otherwise the convection will make the
inside colder, losing the desired effect. The greenhouse may be combined with
heat storage or an opaque mask.
**** Photothermic module[edit] ****
Photothermic modules on roof
Photothermic modules convert solar light into heat. They easily heat domestic
water to 80 Â°C (353 K). They are put facing the sunny cardinal point, rather
pointing towards the horizon to avoid overheating in summer, and take more
calories in the winter. In a 45Â° North place, the module should face the south
and the angle to the horizontal should be about 70Â°.
The use of intermediate solar heat systems like evacuated tubes, compound
parabolic, and parabolic trough, is discussed as they correspond to specific,
intermediate needs. A customer who wants a cheap system will prefer the
photothermic, giving 80 Â°C (353 K) hot water with 70-85 % efficiency. A
customer who wants high temperatures will prefer the solar parabola, giving 200
Â°C (573 K) with 70-85 % efficiency.
Do_it_yourself photothermic modules are cheaper and can use a spiral pipe, with
hot water coming from the center of the module. Other geometries exist, like
serpentine or quadrangular.
If on a flat roof, a mirror can be placed in front of the photothermic module
to give it more sunlight.
The photothermic module has become popular in Mediterranean countries, with
Greece and Spain counting with 30-40 % of homes equipped with this system, and
becoming part of the landscape.
**** Photovoltaic module[edit] ****
Photovoltaic tiles on roof
Photovoltaic modules convert solar light into electricity. Classical silicon
solar modules have up to 25 % efficiency but they are rigid and cannot easily
be placed on curves. Thin film solar modules are flexible, but they have lower
efficiency and lifetime.
Photovoltaic tiles combine the useful to the pleasant by providing tile-like
photovoltaic surfaces.
A pragmatic rule is to put the photovoltaic surface facing the sunny cardinal
point, with a latitude-equal angle to the horizontal. For example, if the house
is 33Â° South, the photovoltaic surface should face the north with 33Â° to the
horizontal. From this rule comes a general standard of roof angle, that is the
norm in solar architecture.
**** Thermal storage[edit] ****
The simplest solar heat water system is to place a hot_water_storage_tank
towards the Sun and paint it black.
A thick ground of rock in a greenhouse will keep some heat through the night.
The rock will absorb heat in the day and emit it in the night. Water has the
best thermal_capacity for a common material and remains a sure value.
**** Electrical storage[edit] ****
In autonomous (off-grid) photovoltaic systems, batteries are used to store the
excess of electricity, and deliver it when needed in the night.
Grid-connected systems can use interseasonal storage thanks to pumped-storage
hydroelectricity. An innovative storage method, compressed_air_energy_storage,
is also being studied, and may be applied at the scale of a region or a home,
whether a cave or a tank is used to store the compressed air.
**** White wall[edit] ****
White walled church in Santorini
In the Greek islands, the houses are painted in white to keep from absorbing
heat. The white walls covered with lime and the blue roofs make the Greek
islands' traditional style appreciated by tourists for its colors, and by the
inhabitants for the cooler interior air.
**** Black wall[edit] ****
Black walled house in Norway
In Nordic countries, this is the opposite: the houses are painted in black to
better absorb the irradiation heat. Basalt is an interesting material as it is
naturally black and exhibits high thermal storage capacity.
**** Solar tracker[edit] ****
Part or all of the house can track the Sun's race in the sky to catch its
light. The Heliotrope, the first positive energy house in the world, rotates to
catch the sunlight, converted into electricity by photovoltaic modules, heating
the house through the translucent glass.
Tracking requires electronics and automatics. There are two ways to let the
system know where the Sun is: instrumental and theoretical. The instrumental
method uses captors of light to detect the Sun's position. The theoretical
method uses astronomical formulas to know the Sun's place. One or two axis
motors will make the solar system rotate to face the Sun and catch more of its
Sunlight.
A photovoltaic or photothermic module can gain more than 50% of production,
thanks to a tracker system.[6]
**** Solar mask[edit] ****
The Heliodome has shadow in the summer, and sunlight in the winter.
Sometimes the heat becomes too high, so a shadow may be desired. The Heliodome
has been built in such a way that the roof hides the Sun in the summer to avoid
overheating, and lets the sunlight pass in the winter.[7]
As a mask, any opaque material is fine. A curtain, a cliff, or a wall can be
solar masks. If a leafy tree is put in front of a greenhouse, it may hide the
greenhouse in the summer, and let the sunlight enter in the winter, when the
leaves have fallen. The shadows will not work the same according to the season.
Using the seasonal change to get shadow in the summer, light in the winter, is
a general rule for a solar mask.
**** Solar chimney[edit] ****
A solar_chimney is a chimney of outside black color. They were used in Roman
antiquity as a ventilation system. The black surface makes the chimney heat
with sunlight. The air inside gets warmer and moves up, pumping the air from
the underground, that is at 15 Â°C (288 K) all the year. This traditional air-
ground exchanger was used to make the houses cool in the summer, mild in the
winter.
The solar chimney may be coupled with a badgir or a wood chimney for stronger
effect.
**** Solar parabola[edit] ****
The Auroville's solar parabola
A solar parabola is a parabolic mirror that concentrates the sunlight to reach
high temperatures. In Auroville's collective kitchen, a large solar parabola on
the roof provides heat for cooking.
The solar parabola can also be used for industrial building. The Odeillo_solar
furnace, one of the largest solar parabola in the world, concentrates the
sunlight 10,000 times and reaches temperatures above 3,200 K. No material
resists, even diamond melts. It opens the vision of a futuristic metallurgy,
using a clean and renewable source of energy.
***** Examples[edit] *****
One of the first large commercial buildings to exemplify solar architecture is
4 Times Square (also known as the CondÃ©_Nast_Building) in New_York_City. It
has built-in solar panels on the 37th through the 43rd floors, and incorporated
more energy-efficient technology than any other skyscraper at the time of its
construction.[4] The National_Stadium in Kaohsiung,_Taiwan, designed by the
Japanese architect Toyo_Ito, is a dragon-shaped structure that has 8,844 solar
panels on its roof.[citation_needed] It was built in 2009 to house the 2009
world games. Constructed completely of recycled materials, it is the largest
solar-powered stadium in the world and powers the surrounding neighborhood when
it is not in use. The Sundial Building in China was built to symbolize the need
for replacing fossil_fuels with renewable_energy sources. The building is
shaped like a fan and is covered in 4,600 square metres (50,000 sq ft) of solar
panels. It was named the world's largest solar-powered office building in 2009.
Although it is not yet completed, the Solar City Tower in Rio_de_Janeiro is
another example of what solar architecture might look like in the future. It is
a power plant that generates energy for the city during the day while also
pumping water to the top of the structure. At night, when the sun is not
shining, the water will be released to run over turbines that will continue to
generate electricity. It was set to be revealed at the 2016_Olympic_Games in
Rio, although the project is still in the proposal phase.[8]
***** Environmental benefits[edit] *****
Using solar power in architecture contributes to a world of clean and renewable
energy. This is an investment: the initial price is high, but afterwards, there
is nearly nothing to pay. On the contrary, fossil and fissile energies are
cheap in the beginning, but cost tremendous amounts to humans and nature. The
Fukushima catastrophe is evaluated to cost 210 billion dollars to Japan,[9].
Global warming has already been a cause of species extinction.
Solar architecture is then anti-crisis. If all houses were to be rebuilt to
meet solar architecture standards, this would bring hope, jobs, money, and
economical growth.
***** Criticism[edit] *****
According to an article on ECN's website titled "Architects just want to
develop attractive buildings", an architect's main purpose is to "create a
spatial object with lines, shapes, colours and texture. These are the
challenges for the architect within the customer's programme of requirements.
But they do not immediately think of using a solar panel as an interesting
building material. There is still much to be achieved here."[10] In the article
it is stated multiple times that solar panels are not an architect's first
choice for building material because of their cost and aesthetics.
Another criticism of installing solar panels is their upfront cost. According
to energyinfomative.org, the average cost for a residential solar system is
between $15,000 and $40,000 (USD), and about $7 per watt.[11] In the article,
it says that at today's rates, it would take 10 years to pay off an average
system. As a solar panel may last more than 20 years,[12] in the end, it
becomes a benefit.
