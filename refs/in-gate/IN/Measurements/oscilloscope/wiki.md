An 'oscilloscope', previously called an 'oscillograph',[1][2] and informally
known as a scope or o-scope, CRO (for cathode-ray oscilloscope), or DSO (for
the more modern digital storage oscilloscope), is a type of electronic_test
instrument that graphically displays varying signal voltages, usually as a two-
dimensional plot of one or more signals as a function of time. Other signals
(such as sound or vibration) can be converted to voltages and displayed.
Oscilloscopes display the change of an electrical signal over time, with
voltage and time as the Y- and X-axes, respectively, on a calibrated scale. The
waveform can then be analyzed for properties such as amplitude, frequency, rise
time, time interval, distortion, and others. Modern digital instruments may
calculate and display these properties directly. Originally, calculation of
these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built
into the screen of the instrument.[3]
The oscilloscope can be adjusted so that repetitive signals can be observed as
a continuous shape on the screen. A storage oscilloscope can capture a single
event and display it continuously, so the user can observe events that would
otherwise appear too briefly to see directly.
Oscilloscopes are used in the sciences, medicine, engineering, automotive and
the telecommunications industry. General-purpose instruments are used for
maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. Special-purpose
oscilloscopes may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition
system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an electrocardiogram.
Early oscilloscopes used cathode_ray_tubes (CRTs) as their display element
(hence they were commonly referred to as CROs) and linear amplifiers for signal
processing. Storage oscilloscopes used special storage CRTs to maintain a
steady display of a single brief signal. CROs were later largely superseded by
digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) with thin_panel_displays, fast analog-to-
digital_converters and digital_signal_processors. DSOs without integrated
displays (sometimes known as digitisers) are available at lower cost and use a
general-purpose digital_computer to process and display waveforms.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: Oscilloscope_history
The Braun tube was known in 1897, and in 1899 Jonathan_Zenneck equipped it with
beam-forming plates and a magnetic field for sweeping the trace.[4] Early
cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements as
early as the 1920s, but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the
cathode emitters. V. K. Zworykin described a permanently sealed, high-vacuum
cathode ray tube with a thermionic emitter in 1931. This stable and
reproducible component allowed General_Radio to manufacture an oscilloscope
that was usable outside a laboratory setting.[3] After World_War II surplus
electronic parts became the basis of revival of Heathkit_Corporation, and a $50
oscilloscope kit made from such parts was a first market success.
***** Features and uses[edit] *****
[Basic_Oscilloscope_Front_Panel_Image.]
Basic oscilloscope
**** Description[edit] ****
The basic oscilloscope, as shown in the illustration, is typically divided into
four sections: the display, vertical controls, horizontal controls and trigger
controls. The display is usually a CRT (historically) or LCD panel laid out
with horizontal and vertical reference lines called the graticule. CRT displays
also have controls for focus, intensity, and beam finder.
The vertical section controls the amplitude of the displayed signal. This
section has a volts-per-division (Volts/Div) selector knob, an AC/DC/Ground
selector switch, and the vertical (primary) input for the instrument.
Additionally, this section is typically equipped with the vertical beam
position knob.
The horizontal section controls the time base or "sweep" of the instrument. The
primary control is the Seconds-per-Division (Sec/Div) selector switch. Also
included is a horizontal input for plotting dual X-Y axis signals. The
horizontal beam position knob is generally located in this section.
The trigger section controls the start event of the sweep. The trigger can be
set to automatically restart after each sweep, or can be configured to respond
to an internal or external event. The principal controls of this section are
the source and coupling selector switches, and an external trigger input (EXT
Input) and level adjustment.
In addition to the basic instrument, most oscilloscopes are supplied with a
probe as shown. The probe connects to any input on the instrument and typically
has a resistor of ten times the oscilloscope's input impedance. This results in
a .1 (â10X) attenuation factor; this helps to isolate the capacitive load
presented by the probe cable from the signal being measured. Some probes have a
switch allowing the operator to bypass the resistor when appropriate.[3]
*** Size and portability[edit] ***
Most modern oscilloscopes are lightweight, portable instruments compact enough
for a single person to carry. In addition to portable units, the market offers
a number of miniature battery-powered instruments for field service
applications. Laboratory grade oscilloscopes, especially older units that use
vacuum_tubes, are generally bench-top devices or are mounted on dedicated
carts. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be rack-mounted or permanently mounted
into a custom instrument housing.
*** Inputs[edit] ***
The signal to measure is fed to one of the input connectors, which is usually a
coaxial connector such as a BNC or UHF_type. Binding_posts or banana_plugs may
be used for lower frequencies. If the signal source has its own coaxial
connector, then a simple coaxial_cable is used; otherwise, a specialized cable
called a "scope_probe", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general,
for routine use, an open wire test lead for connecting to the point being
observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary. General-
purpose oscilloscopes usually present an input impedance of 1 megohm in
parallel with a small but known capacitance such as 20 picofarads.[5] This
allows the use of standard oscilloscope probes.[6] Scopes for use with very
high frequencies may have 50âohm inputs. These must be either connected
directly to a 50âohm signal source or used with Z0 or active probes.
Less-frequently-used inputs include one (or two) for triggering the sweep,
horizontal deflection for XâY mode displays, and trace brightening/darkening,
sometimes called z'âaxis inputs.
*** Probes[edit] ***
Main article: Test_probe_Â§ Oscilloscope_probes
Open wire test leads (flying leads) are likely to pick up interference, so they
are not suitable for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high
inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a shielded
cable (i.e., coaxial cable) is better for low level signals. Coaxial cable also
has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50 ohm cable has
about 90 pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe
loads a circuit with a capacitance of about 110 pF and a resistance of
1 megohm.
To minimize loading, attenuator probes (e.g., 10X probes) are used. A typical
probe uses a 9 megohm series resistor shunted by a low-value capacitor to make
an RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC
time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9 megohm series resistor
is shunted by a 12.2 pF capacitor for a time constant of 110 microseconds. The
cable capacitance of 90 pF in parallel with the scope input of 20 pF and
1 megohm (total capacitance 110 pF) also gives a time constant of 110
microseconds. In practice, there is an adjustment so the operator can precisely
match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching
the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low
frequencies (where the resistance of R is much less than the reactance of C),
the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance
much greater than reactance), the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.[7]
The result is a frequency compensated probe for modest frequencies. It presents
a load of about 10 megohms shunted by 12 pF. Such a probe is an improvement,
but does not work well when the time scale shrinks to several cable transit
times or less (transit time is typically 5 ns).[clarification_needed] In that
time frame, the cable looks like its characteristic impedance, and reflections
from the transmission line mismatch at the scope input and the probe causes
ringing.[8] The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission
lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe
perform well at several hundred megahertz. Consequently, there are other
adjustments for completing the compensation.[9][10]
Probes with 10:1 attenuation are by far the most common; for large signals (and
slightly-less capacitive loading), 100:1 probes may be used. There are also
probes that contain switches to select 10:1 or direct (1:1) ratios, but the
latter setting has significant capacitance (tens of pF) at the probe tip,
because the whole cable's capacitance is then directly connected.
Most oscilloscopes provide for probe attenuation factors, displaying the
effective sensitivity at the probe tip. Historically, some auto-sensing
circuitry used indicator lamps behind translucent windows in the panel to
illuminate different parts of the sensitivity scale. To do so, the probe
connectors (modified BNCs) had an extra contact to define the probe's
attenuation. (A certain value of resistor, connected to ground, "encodes" the
attenuation.) Because probes wear out, and because the auto-sensing circuitry
is not compatible between different oscilloscope makes, auto-sensing probe
scaling is not foolproof. Likewise, manually setting the probe attenuation is
prone to user error. Setting the probe scaling incorrectly is a common error,
and throws the reading off by a factor of 10.
Special high_voltage_probes form compensated attenuators with the oscilloscope
input. These have a large probe body, and some require partly filling a
canister surrounding the series resistor with volatile liquid fluorocarbon to
displace air. The oscilloscope end has a box with several waveform-trimming
adjustments. For safety, a barrier disc keeps the user's fingers away from the
point being examined. Maximum voltage is in the low tens of kV. (Observing a
high voltage ramp can create a staircase waveform with steps at different
points every repetition, until the probe tip is in contact. Until then, a tiny
arc charges the probe tip, and its capacitance holds the voltage (open
circuit). As the voltage continues to climb, another tiny arc charges the tip
further.)
There are also current probes, with cores that surround the conductor carrying
current to be examined. One type has a hole for the conductor, and requires
that the wire be passed through the hole for semi-permanent or permanent
mounting. However, other types, used for temporary testing, have a two-part
core that can be clamped around a wire. Inside the probe, a coil wound around
the core provides a current into an appropriate load, and the voltage across
that load is proportional to current. This type of probe only senses AC.
A more-sophisticated probe includes a magnetic flux sensor (Hall_effect sensor)
in the magnetic circuit. The probe connects to an amplifier, which feeds (low
frequency) current into the coil to cancel the sensed field; the magnitude of
the current provides the low-frequency part of the current waveform, right down
to DC. The coil still picks up high frequencies. There is a combining network
akin to a loudspeaker crossover network.
**** Front panel controls[edit] ****
*** Focus control[edit] ***
This control adjusts CRT focus to obtain the sharpest, most-detailed trace. In
practice, focus must be adjusted slightly when observing very different
signals, so it must be an external control. The control varies the voltage
applied to a focusing anode within the CRT. Flat-panel displays do not need
this control.
*** Intensity control[edit] ***
This adjusts trace brightness. Slow traces on CRT oscilloscopes need less, and
fast ones, especially if not often repeated, require more brightness. On flat
panels, however, trace brightness is essentially independent of sweep speed,
because the internal signal processing effectively synthesizes the display from
the digitized data, or from the kitty picture.
*** Astigmatism[edit] ***
This control may instead be called "shape" or "spot shape". It adjusts the
relative voltages on two of the CRT anodes, changing a displayed spot from
elliptical in one plane through a circular spot to an ellipse at 90 degrees to
the first. This control may be absent from simpler oscilloscope designs or may
even be an internal control. It is not necessary with flat panel displays.
*** Beam finder[edit] ***
Modern oscilloscopes have direct-coupled deflection amplifiers, which means the
trace could be deflected off-screen. They also might have their beam blanked
without the operator knowing it. To help in restoring a visible display, the
beam finder circuit overrides any blanking and limits the beam deflected to the
visible portion of the screen. Beam-finder circuits often distort the trace
while activated.
*** Graticule[edit] ***
The graticule is a grid of lines that serve as reference marks for measuring
the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or
on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1 cm grid with closer tick
marks (often at 2 mm) on the centre vertical and horizontal axis. One expects
to see ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major
divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to
measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Frequency can
also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its
reciprocal.
On old and lower-cost CRT oscilloscopes the graticule is a sheet of plastic,
often with light-diffusing markings and concealed lamps at the edge of the
graticule. The lamps had a brightness control. Higher-cost instruments have the
graticule marked on the inside face of the CRT, to eliminate parallax_errors;
better ones also had adjustable edge illumination with diffusing markings.
(Diffusing markings appear bright.) Digital oscilloscopes, however, generate
the graticule markings on the display in the same way as the trace.
External graticules also protect the glass face of the CRT from accidental
impact. Some CRT oscilloscopes with internal graticules have an unmarked tinted
sheet plastic light filter to enhance trace contrast; this also serves to
protect the faceplate of the CRT.
Accuracy and resolution of measurements using a graticule is relatively
limited; better instruments sometimes have movable bright markers on the trace.
These permit internal circuits to make more refined measurements.
Both calibrated vertical sensitivity and calibrated horizontal time are set in
1 - 2 - 5 - 10 steps. This leads, however, to some awkward interpretations of
minor divisions.
Digital oscilloscopes generate the graticule digitally. The scale, spacing,
etc., of the graticule can therefore be varied, and accuracy of readings may be
improved.
*** Timebase controls[edit] ***
Computer Model of the impact of increasing the timebase time/division.
These select the horizontal speed of the CRT's spot as it creates the trace;
this process is commonly referred to as the sweep. In all but the least-costly
modern oscilloscopes, the sweep speed is selectable and calibrated in units of
time per major graticule division. Quite a wide range of sweep speeds is
generally provided, from seconds to as fast as picoseconds (in the fastest) per
division. Usually, a continuously-variable control (often a knob in front of
the calibrated selector knob) offers uncalibrated speeds, typically slower than
calibrated. This control provides a range somewhat greater than the calibrated
steps, making any speed between the steps available.
*** Holdoff control[edit] ***
Some higher-end analog oscilloscopes have a holdoff control. This sets a time
after a trigger during which the sweep circuit cannot be triggered again. It
helps provide a stable display of a repetitive events in which some triggers
would create confusing displays. It is usually set to minimum, because a longer
time decreases the number of sweeps per second, resulting in a dimmer trace.
See Holdoff for a more detailed description.
*** Vertical sensitivity, coupling, and polarity controls[edit] ***
To accommodate a wide range of input amplitudes, a switch selects calibrated
sensitivity of the vertical deflection. Another control, often in front of the
calibrated-selector knob, offers a continuously-variable sensitivity over a
limited range from calibrated to less-sensitive settings.
Often the observed signal is offset by a steady component, and only the changes
are of interest. An input coupling switch in the "AC" position connects a
capacitor in series with the input. This passes only the changes (provided they
are not too slow ("slow" would mean visible[citation_needed]). However, when
the signal has a fixed offset of interest, or changes quite slowly, the user
will usually prefer "DC" coupling, which bypasses any such capacitor. Most
oscilloscopes offer the DC input option. For convenience, to see where zero
volts input currently shows on the screen, many oscilloscopes have a third
switch position (usually labeled "GND" for ground) that disconnects the input
and grounds it. Often, in this case, the user centers the trace with the
vertical position control.
Better oscilloscopes have a polarity selector. Normally, a positive input moves
the trace upward; the polarity selector offers an "inverting" option, in which
a positive-going signal deflects the trace downward.
*** Horizontal sensitivity control[edit] ***
This control is found only on more elaborate oscilloscopes; it offers
adjustable sensitivity for external horizontal inputs. It is only active when
the instrument is in X-Y mode, i.e. the internal horizontal sweep is turned
off.
*** Vertical position control[edit] ***
Computer model of Vertical position Y offset varying in a sine way
The vertical position control moves the whole displayed trace up and down. It
is used to set the no-input trace exactly on the center line of the graticule,
but also permits offsetting vertically by a limited amount. With direct
coupling, adjustment of this control can compensate for a limited DC component
of an input.
*** Horizontal position control[edit] ***
Computer model of Horizontal position control from X offset increasing
The horizontal position control moves the display sidewise. It usually sets the
left end of the trace at the left edge of the graticule, but it can displace
the whole trace when desired. This control also moves the X-Y mode traces
sidewise in some instruments, and can compensate for a limited DC component as
for vertical position.
*** Dual-trace controls[edit] ***
* (Please see Dual and Multiple-trace Oscilloscopes, below.)
Dual-trace controls green trace = Y = 30*sin(0.1*t)+0.5 teal trace = Y = 30*sin
(0.3*t)
Each input channel usually has its own set of sensitivity, coupling, and
position controls, though some four-trace oscilloscopes have only minimal
controls for their third and fourth channels.
Dual-trace oscilloscopes have a mode switch to select either channel alone,
both channels, or (in some) an XâY display, which uses the second channel for
X deflection. When both channels are displayed, the type of channel switching
can be selected on some oscilloscopes; on others, the type depends upon
timebase setting. If manually selectable, channel switching can be free-running
(asynchronous), or between consecutive sweeps. Some Philips dual-trace analog
oscilloscopes had a fast analog multiplier, and provided a display of the
product of the input channels.
Multiple-trace oscilloscopes have a switch for each channel to enable or
disable display of the channel's trace.
*** Delayed-sweep controls[edit] ***
* (Please see Delayed sweep, below.)
These include controls for the delayed-sweep timebase, which is calibrated, and
often also variable. The slowest speed is several steps faster than the slowest
main sweep speed, though the fastest is generally the same. A calibrated
multiturn delay time control offers wide range, high resolution delay settings;
it spans the full duration of the main sweep, and its reading corresponds to
graticule divisions (but with much finer precision). Its accuracy is also
superior to that of the display.
A switch selects display modes: Main sweep only, with a brightened region
showing when the delayed sweep is advancing, delayed sweep only, or (on some) a
combination mode.
Good CRT oscilloscopes include a delayed-sweep intensity control, to allow for
the dimmer trace of a much-faster delayed sweep which nevertheless occurs only
once per main sweep. Such oscilloscopes also are likely to have a trace
separation control for multiplexed display of both the main and delayed sweeps
together.
*** Sweep trigger controls[edit] ***
* (Please see Triggered Sweep, below.)
A switch selects the trigger source. It can be an external input, one of the
vertical channels of a dual or multiple-trace oscilloscope, or the AC line
(mains) frequency. Another switch enables or disables auto trigger mode, or
selects single sweep, if provided in the oscilloscope. Either a spring-return
switch position or a pushbutton arms single sweeps.
A trigger level control varies the voltage required to generate a trigger, and
the slope switch selects positive-going or negative-going polarity at the
selected trigger level.
**** Basic types of sweep[edit] ****
*** Triggered sweep[edit] ***
Type 465 Tektronix oscilloscope. This was a popular analog oscilloscope,
portable, and is a representative example.
To display events with unchanging or slowly (visibly) changing waveforms, but
occurring at times that may not be evenly spaced, modern oscilloscopes have
triggered sweeps. Compared to older, simpler oscilloscopes with continuously-
running sweep oscillators, triggered-sweep oscilloscopes are markedly more
versatile.
A triggered sweep starts at a selected point on the signal, providing a stable
display. In this way, triggering allows the display of periodic signals such as
sine waves and square waves, as well as nonperiodic signals such as single
pulses, or pulses that do not recur at a fixed rate.
With triggered sweeps, the scope blanks the beam and starts to reset the sweep
circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme right side of the screen. For a
period of time, called holdoff, (extendable by a front-panel control on some
better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores
triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger
event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold
voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going
negativeâtrigger polarity).
In some cases, variable holdoff time can be useful to make the sweep ignore
interfering triggers that occur before the events to be observed. In the case
of repetitive, but complex waveforms, variable holdoff can provide a stable
display that could not otherwise be achieved.
*** Holdoff[edit] ***
Trigger holdoff defines a certain period following a trigger during which the
sweep cannot be triggered again. This makes it easier to establish a stable
view of a waveform with multiple edges, which would otherwise cause additional
triggers.[11]
** Example[edit] **
Imagine the following repeating waveform:
[Scope_Holdoff_Waveform.gif]
The green line is the waveform, the red vertical partial line represents the
location of the trigger, and the yellow line represents the trigger level. If
the scope was simply set to trigger on every rising edge, this waveform would
cause three triggers for each cycle:
[Scope_Holdoff_Trigger1.gif]
[Trigger2.gif]
[Scope_Holdoff_Trigger3.gif]
Assuming the signal is fairly high frequency, the scope would probably look
something like this:
[Scope_Holdoff_Alltriggers.gif]
On an actual scope, each trigger would be the same channel, so all would be the
same color.
It is desirable for the scope to only trigger on one edge per cycle, so it is
necessary to set the holdoff at slightly less than the period of the waveform.
This prevents triggering from occurring more than once per cycle, but still
lets it trigger on the first edge of the next cycle.
*** Automatic sweep mode[edit] ***
Triggered sweeps can display a blank screen if there are no triggers. To avoid
this, these sweeps include a timing circuit that generates free-running
triggers so a trace is always visible. This is referred to as "auto sweep" or
"automatic sweep" in the controls. Once triggers arrive, the timer stops
providing pseudo-triggers. The user will usually disable automatic sweep when
observing low repetition rates.
*** Recurrent sweeps[edit] ***
If the input signal is periodic, the sweep repetition rate can be adjusted to
display a few cycles of the waveform. Early (tube) oscilloscopes and lowest-
cost oscilloscopes have sweep oscillators that run continuously, and are
uncalibrated. Such oscilloscopes are very simple, comparatively inexpensive,
and were useful in radio servicing and some TV servicing. Measuring voltage or
time is possible, but only with extra equipment, and is quite inconvenient.
They are primarily qualitative instruments.
They have a few (widely spaced) frequency ranges, and relatively wide-range
continuous frequency control within a given range. In use, the sweep frequency
is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to
display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are
visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical
signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The
signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur
free-running, and the display becomes stable.
*** Single sweeps[edit] ***
Some oscilloscopes offer these. The user manually arms the sweep circuit
(typically by a pushbutton or equivalent). "Armed" means it's ready to respond
to a trigger. Once the sweep completes, it resets, and does not sweep again
until re-armed. This mode, combined with an oscilloscope camera, captures
single-shot events.
Types of trigger include:
    * external trigger, a pulse from an external source connected to a
      dedicated input on the scope.
    * edge trigger, an edge detector that generates a pulse when the input
      signal crosses a specified threshold voltage in a specified direction.
      These are the most common types of triggers; the level control sets the
      threshold voltage, and the slope control selects the direction (negative
      or positive-going). (The first sentence of the description also applies
      to the inputs to some digital logic circuits; those inputs have fixed
      threshold and polarity response.)
    * video trigger, a circuit that extracts synchronizing pulses from video
      formats such as PAL and NTSC and triggers the timebase on every line, a
      specified line, every field, or every frame. This circuit is typically
      found in a waveform_monitor device, though some better oscilloscopes
      include this function.
    * delayed trigger, which waits a specified time after an edge trigger
      before starting the sweep. As described under delayed sweeps, a trigger
      delay circuit (typically the main sweep) extends this delay to a known
      and adjustable interval. In this way, the operator can examine a
      particular pulse in a long train of pulses.
Some recent designs of oscilloscopes include more sophisticated triggering
schemes; these are described toward the end of this article.
*** Delayed sweeps[edit] ***
More sophisticated analog oscilloscopes contain a second timebase for a delayed
sweep. A delayed sweep provides a very detailed look at some small selected
portion of the main timebase. The main timebase serves as a controllable delay,
after which the delayed timebase starts. This can start when the delay expires,
or can be triggered (only) after the delay expires. Ordinarily, the delayed
timebase is set for a faster sweep, sometimes much faster, such as 1000:1. At
extreme ratios, jitter in the delays on consecutive main sweeps degrades the
display, but delayed-sweep triggers can overcome this.
The display shows the vertical signal in one of several modes: the main
timebase, or the delayed timebase only, or a combination thereof. When the
delayed sweep is active, the main sweep trace brightens while the delayed sweep
is advancing. In one combination mode, provided only on some oscilloscopes, the
trace changes from the main sweep to the delayed sweep once the delayed sweep
starts, though less of the delayed fast sweep is visible for longer delays.
Another combination mode multiplexes (alternates) the main and delayed sweeps
so that both appear at once; a trace separation control displaces them. DSOs
can display waveforms this way, without offering a delayed timebase as such.
**** Dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes[edit] ****
Oscilloscopes with two vertical inputs, referred to as dual-trace
oscilloscopes, are extremely useful and commonplace. Using a single-beam CRT,
they multiplex the inputs, usually switching between them fast enough to
display two traces apparently at once. Less common are oscilloscopes with more
traces; four inputs are common among these, but a few (Kikusui, for one)
offered a display of the sweep trigger signal if desired. Some multi-trace
oscilloscopes use the external trigger input as an optional vertical input, and
some have third and fourth channels with only minimal controls. In all cases,
the inputs, when independently displayed, are time-multiplexed, but dual-trace
oscilloscopes often can add their inputs to display a real-time analog sum.
Inverting one channel while adding them together results in a display of the
differences between them, provided neither channel is overloaded. This
difference mode can provide a moderate-performance differential input.)
Switching channels can be asynchronous, i.e. free-running, with respect to the
sweep frequency; or it can be done after each horizontal sweep is complete.
Asynchronous switching is usually designated "Chopped", while sweep-
synchronized is designated "Alt[ernate]". A given channel is alternately
connected and disconnected, leading to the term "chopped". Multi-trace
oscilloscopes also switch channels either in chopped or alternate modes.
In general, chopped mode is better for slower sweeps. It is possible for the
internal chopping rate to be a multiple of the sweep repetition rate, creating
blanks in the traces, but in practice this is rarely a problem. The gaps in one
trace are overwritten by traces of the following sweep. A few oscilloscopes had
a modulated chopping rate to avoid this occasional problem. Alternate mode,
however, is better for faster sweeps.
True dual-beam CRT oscilloscopes did exist, but were not common. One type
(Cossor, U.K.) had a beam-splitter plate in its CRT, and single-ended
deflection following the splitter. Others had two complete electron guns,
requiring tight control of axial (rotational) mechanical alignment in
manufacturing the CRT. Beam-splitter types had horizontal deflection common to
both vertical channels, but dual-gun oscilloscopes could have separate time
bases, or use one time base for both channels. Multiple-gun CRTs (up to ten
guns) were made in past decades. With ten guns, the envelope (bulb) was
cylindrical throughout its length. (Also see "CRT Invention" in Oscilloscope
history.)
**** The vertical amplifier[edit] ****
In an analog oscilloscope, the vertical amplifier acquires the signal[s] to be
displayed and provides a signal large enough to deflect the CRT's beam. In
better oscilloscopes, it delays the signal by a fraction of a microsecond. The
maximum deflection is at least somewhat beyond the edges of the graticule, and
more typically some distance off-screen. The amplifier has to have low
distortion to display its input accurately (it must be linear), and it has to
recover quickly from overloads. As well, its time-domain response has to
represent transients accuratelyâminimal overshoot, rounding, and tilt of a
flat pulse top.
A vertical input goes to a frequency-compensated step attenuator to reduce
large signals to prevent overload. The attenuator feeds one or more low-level
stages, which in turn feed gain stages (and a delay-line driver if there is a
delay). Subsequent gain stages lead to the final output stage, which develops a
large signal swing (tens of volts, sometimes over 100 volts) for CRT
electrostatic deflection.
In dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes, an internal electronic switch selects
the relatively low-level output of one channel's early-stage amplifier and
sends it to the following stages of the vertical amplifier.
In free-running ("chopped") mode, the oscillator (which may be simply a
different operating mode of the switch driver) blanks the beam before
switching, and unblanks it only after the switching transients have settled.
Part way through the amplifier is a feed to the sweep trigger circuits, for
internal triggering from the signal. This feed would be from an individual
channel's amplifier in a dual or multi-trace oscilloscope, the channel
depending upon the setting of the trigger source selector.
This feed precedes the delay (if there is one), which allows the sweep circuit
to unblank the CRT and start the forward sweep, so the CRT can show the
triggering event. High-quality analog delays add a modest cost to an
oscilloscope, and are omitted in cost-sensitive oscilloscopes.
The delay, itself, comes from a special cable with a pair of conductors wound
around a flexible, magnetically soft core. The coiling provides distributed
inductance, while a conductive layer close to the wires provides distributed
capacitance. The combination is a wideband transmission line with considerable
delay per unit length. Both ends of the delay cable require matched impedances
to avoid reflections.
*** X-Y mode[edit] ***
A 24-hour_clock displayed on a CRT oscilloscope configured in X-Y mode as a
vector_monitor with dual R2R_DACs to generate the analog voltages.
Most modern oscilloscopes have several inputs for voltages, and thus can be
used to plot one varying voltage versus another. This is especially useful for
graphing I-V curves (current versus voltage characteristics) for components
such as diodes, as well Lissajous_patterns. Lissajous figures are an example of
how an oscilloscope can be used to track phase differences between multiple
input signals. This is very frequently used in broadcast_engineering to plot
the left and right stereophonic channels, to ensure that the stereo_generator
is calibrated properly. Historically, stable Lissajous figures were used to
show that two sine waves had a relatively simple frequency relationship, a
numerically-small ratio. They also indicated phase difference between two sine
waves of the same frequency.
The X-Y mode also lets the oscilloscope serve as a vector_monitor to display
images or user interfaces. Many early games, such as Tennis_for_Two, used an
oscilloscope as an output device.[12]
Complete loss of signal in an X-Y CRT display means that the beam is
stationary, striking a small spot. This risks burning the phosphor if the
brightness is too high. Such damage was more common in older scopes as the
phosphors previously used burned more easily. Some dedicated X-Y displays
reduce beam current greatly, or blank the display entirely, if there are no
inputs present.
**** Bandwidth[edit] ****
As with all practical instruments, oscilloscopes do not respond equally to all
possible input frequencies. The range of frequencies an oscilloscope can
usefully display is referred to as its bandwidth. Bandwidth applies primarily
to the Y-axis, though the X-axis sweeps must be fast enough to show the
highest-frequency waveforms.
The bandwidth is defined as the frequency at which the sensitivity is 0.707 of
the sensitivity at DC or the lowest AC frequency (a drop of 3 dB).[13] The
oscilloscope's response drops off rapidly as the input frequency rises above
that point. Within the stated bandwidth the response is not necessarily exactly
uniform (or "flat"), but should always fall within a +0 to -3 dB range. One
source[13] says there is a noticeable effect on the accuracy of voltage
measurements at only 20 percent of the stated bandwidth. Some oscilloscopes'
specifications do include a narrower tolerance range within the stated
bandwidth.
Probes also have bandwidth limits and must be chosen and used to properly
handle the frequencies of interest. To achieve the flattest response, most
probes must be "compensated" (an adjustment performed using a test signal from
the oscilloscope) to allow for the reactance of the probe's cable.
Another related specification is rise_time. This is the duration of the fastest
pulse that can be resolved by the scope. It is related to the bandwidth
approximately by:
Bandwidth in Hz x rise time in seconds = 0.35 [14]
For example, an oscilloscope intended to resolve pulses with a rise time of 1
nanosecond would have a bandwidth of 350 MHz.
In analog instruments, the bandwidth of the oscilloscope is limited by the
vertical amplifiers and the CRT or other display subsystem. In digital
instruments, the sampling rate of the analog_to_digital_converter (ADC) is a
factor, but the stated analog bandwidth (and therefore the overall bandwidth of
the instrument) is usually less than the ADC's Nyquist_frequency. This is due
to limitations in the analog signal amplifier, deliberate design of the anti-
aliasing_filter that precedes the ADC, or both.
For a digital oscilloscope, a rule of thumb is that the continuous sampling
rate should be ten times the highest frequency desired to resolve; for example
a 20 megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up to
about 2 megahertz. This lets the anti-aliasing filter be designed with a 3 dB
down point of 2 MHz and an effective cutoff at 10 MHz (the Nyquist frequency),
avoiding the artifacts of a very steep ("brick-wall")_filter.
A sampling_oscilloscope can display signals of considerably higher frequency
than the sampling rate if the signals are exactly, or nearly, repetitive. It
does this by taking one sample from each successive repetition of the input
waveform, each sample being at an increased time interval from the trigger
event. The waveform is then displayed from these collected samples. This
mechanism is referred to as "equivalent-time sampling".[15] Some oscilloscopes
can operate in either this mode or in the more traditional "real-time" mode at
the operator's choice.
***** Other features[edit] *****
A computer model of the sweep of the oscilloscope
Some oscilloscopes have cursors. These are lines that can be moved about the
screen to measure the time interval between two points, or the difference
between two voltages. A few older oscilloscopes simply brightened the trace at
movable locations. These cursors are more accurate than visual estimates
referring to graticule lines.
Better quality general purpose oscilloscopes include a calibration signal for
setting up the compensation of test probes; this is (often) a 1 kHz square-wave
signal of a definite peak-to-peak voltage available at a test terminal on the
front panel. Some better oscilloscopes also have a squared-off loop for
checking and adjusting current probes.
Sometimes a user wants to see an event that happens only occasionally. To catch
these events, some oscilloscopesâcalled storage scopesâpreserve the most
recent sweep on the screen. This was originally achieved with a special CRT, a
"storage_tube", which retained the image of even a very brief event for a long
time.
Some digital oscilloscopes can sweep at speeds as slow as once per hour,
emulating a strip chart_recorder. That is, the signal scrolls across the screen
from right to left. Most oscilloscopes with this facility switch from a sweep
to a strip-chart mode at about one sweep per ten seconds. This is because
otherwise, the scope looks broken: it's collecting data, but the dot cannot be
seen.
All but the simplest models of current oscilloscopes more often use digital
signal sampling. Samples feed fast analog-to-digital converters, following
which all signal processing (and storage) is digital.
Many oscilloscopes accommodate plug-in modules for different purposes,
e.g., high-sensitivity amplifiers of relatively narrow bandwidth, differential
amplifiers, amplifiers with four or more channels, sampling plugins for
repetitive signals of very high frequency, and special-purpose plugins,
including audio/ultrasonic spectrum analyzers, and stable-offset-voltage
direct-coupled channels with relatively high gain.
**** Examples of use[edit] ****
Lissajous_figures on an oscilloscope, with 90 degrees phase difference between
x and y inputs.
One of the most frequent uses of scopes is troubleshooting malfunctioning
electronic equipment. For example, where a voltmeter may show a totally
unexpected voltage, a scope may reveal that the circuit is oscillating. In
other cases the precise shape or timing of a pulse is important.
In a piece of electronic equipment, for example, the connections between stages
(e.g., electronic_mixers, electronic_oscillators, amplifiers) may be 'probed'
for the expected signal, using the scope as a simple signal tracer. If the
expected signal is absent or incorrect, some preceding stage of the electronics
is not operating correctly. Since most failures occur because of a single
faulty component, each measurement can show that some of the stages of a
complex piece of equipment either work, or probably did not cause the fault.
Once the faulty stage is found, further probing can usually tell a skilled
technician exactly which component has failed. Once the component is replaced,
the unit can be restored to service, or at least the next fault can be
isolated. This sort of troubleshooting is typical of radio and TV receivers, as
well as audio amplifiers, but can apply to quite-different devices such as
electronic motor drives.
Another use is to check newly designed circuitry. Often, a newly designed
circuit misbehaves because of design errors, bad voltage levels, electrical
noise etc. Digital electronics usually operate from a clock, so a dual-trace
scope showing both the clock signal and a test signal dependent upon the clock
is useful. Storage scopes are helpful for "capturing" rare electronic events
that cause defective operation.
*** Pictures of use[edit] ***

    * AC hum on sound.
    * Sum of a low-frequency and a high-frequency signal.
    * Bad filter on sine.

**** Automotive use[edit] ****
First appearing in the 1970s for ignition system analysis, automotive
oscilloscopes are becoming an important workshop tool for testing sensors and
output signals on electronic engine_management systems, braking and stability
systems. Some oscilloscopes can trigger and decode serial bus messages, such as
the CAN_bus commonly used in automotive applications.
**** Selection[edit] ****
For work at high frequencies and with fast digital signals, the bandwidth of
the vertical amplifiers and sampling rate must be high enough. For general-
purpose use, a bandwidth of at least 100 MHz is usually satisfactory. A much
lower bandwidth is sufficient for audio-frequency applications only. A useful
sweep range is from one second to 100 nanoseconds, with appropriate triggering
and (for analog instruments) sweep delay. A well-designed, stable trigger
circuit is required for a steady display. The chief benefit of a quality
oscilloscope is the quality of the trigger circuit.[citation_needed]
Key selection criteria of a DSO (apart from input bandwidth) are the sample
memory depth and sample rate. Early DSOs in the mid- to late 1990s only had a
few KB of sample memory per channel. This is adequate for basic waveform
display, but does not allow detailed examination of the waveform or inspection
of long data packets for example. Even entry-level (<$500) modern DSOs now have
1 MB or more of sample memory per channel, and this has become the expected
minimum in any modern DSO.[citation_needed] Often this sample memory is shared
between channels, and can sometimes only be fully available at lower sample
rates. At the highest sample rates, the memory may be limited to a few tens of
KB.[16] Any modern "real-time" sample rate DSO typically has 5â10 times the
input bandwidth in sample rate. So a 100 MHz bandwidth DSO would have 500 Ms/
s â 1 Gs/s sample rate. The theoretical minimum sample rate required, using
SinX/x interpolation, is 2.5 times the bandwidth.[17]
Analog oscilloscopes have been almost totally displaced by digital storage
scopes except for use exclusively at lower frequencies. Greatly increased
sample rates have largely eliminated the display of incorrect signals, known as
"aliasing", which was sometimes present in the first generation of digital
scopes. The problem can still occur when, for example, viewing a short section
of a repetitive waveform that repeats at intervals thousands of times longer
than the section viewed (for example a short synchronization pulse at the
beginning of a particular television line), with an oscilloscope that cannot
store the extremely large number of samples between one instance of the short
section and the next.
The used test equipment market, particularly on-line auction venues, typically
has a wide selection of older analog scopes available. However it is becoming
more difficult to obtain replacement parts for these instruments, and repair
services are generally unavailable from the original manufacturer. Used
instruments are usually out of calibration, and recalibration by companies with
the equipment and expertise usually costs more than the second-hand value of
the instrument.[citation_needed]
As of 2007[update], a 350 MHz bandwidth (BW), 2.5 gigasamples per second (GS/
s), dual-channel digital storage scope costs about US$7000 new.[citation
needed]
On the lowest end, an inexpensive hobby-grade single-channel DSO could be
purchased for under $90 as of June 2011. These often have limited bandwidth and
other facilities, but fulfill the basic functions of an oscilloscope.
**** Software[edit] ****
Many oscilloscopes today provide one or more external interfaces to allow
remote instrument_control by external software. These interfaces (or buses)
include GPIB, Ethernet, serial_port, and USB.
***** Types and models[edit] *****
Main article: Oscilloscope_types
The following section is a brief summary of various types and models available.
For a detailed discussion, refer to the other article.
**** Cathode-ray oscilloscope (CRO)[edit] ****
Further information: Oscilloscope_types_Â§ Cathode-ray_oscilloscope
Example of an analog oscilloscope Lissajous figure, showing a harmonic
relationship of 1 horizontal oscillation cycle to 3 vertical oscillation
cycles.
For analog_television, an analog oscilloscope can be used as a vectorscope to
analyze complex signal properties, such as this display of SMPTE_color_bars.
The earliest and simplest type of oscilloscope consisted of a cathode_ray_tube,
a vertical amplifier, a timebase, a horizontal amplifier and a power_supply.
These are now called "analog" scopes to distinguish them from the "digital"
scopes that became common in the 1990s and later.
Analog scopes do not necessarily include a calibrated reference grid for size
measurement of waves, and they may not display waves in the traditional sense
of a line segment sweeping from left to right. Instead, they could be used for
signal analysis by feeding a reference signal into one axis and the signal to
measure into the other axis. For an oscillating reference and measurement
signal, this results in a complex looping pattern referred to as a Lissajous
curve. The shape of the curve can be interpreted to identify properties of the
measurement signal in relation to the reference signal, and is useful across a
wide range of oscillation frequencies.
**** Dual-beam oscilloscope[edit] ****
The dual-beam analog oscilloscope can display two signals simultaneously. A
special dual-beam CRT generates and deflects two separate beams. Multi-trace
analog oscilloscopes can simulate a dual-beam display with chop and alternate
sweepsâbut those features do not provide simultaneous displays. (Real time
digital oscilloscopes offer the same benefits of a dual-beam oscilloscope, but
they do not require a dual-beam display.) The disadvantages of the dual trace
oscilloscope are that it cannot switch quickly between traces, and cannot
capture two fast transient events. A dual beam oscilloscope avoids those
problems.
**** Analog storage oscilloscope[edit] ****
Further information: Cathode_ray_tube_Â§ Oscilloscope_CRTs
Further information: Oscilloscope_types_Â§ Analog_storage_oscilloscope
Trace storage is an extra feature available on some analog scopes; they used
direct-view storage CRTs. Storage allows a trace pattern that normally would
decay in a fraction of a second to remain on the screen for several minutes or
longer. An electrical circuit can then be deliberately activated to store and
erase the trace on the screen.
**** Digital oscilloscopes[edit] ****
Main article: Digital_storage_oscilloscope
While analog devices use continually varying voltages, digital devices use
numbers that correspond to samples of the voltage. In the case of digital
oscilloscopes, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) changes the measured
voltages into digital information.
The digital storage oscilloscope, or DSO for short, is the standard type of
oscilloscope today for the majority of industrial applications, and thanks to
the low costs of entry-level oscilloscopes even for hobbyists. It replaces the
electrostatic storage method in analog storage scopes with digital memory,
which stores sample data as long as required without degradation and displays
it without the brightness issues of storage-type CRTs. It also allows complex
processing of the signal by high-speed digital_signal_processing circuits.[3]
A standard DSO is limited to capturing signals with a bandwidth of less than
half the sampling rate of the ADC (called the Nyquist limit). There is a
variation of the DSO called the digital sampling oscilloscope which can exceed
this limit for certain types of signal, such as high-speed communications
signals, where the waveform consists of repeating pulses. This type of DSO
deliberately samples at a much lower frequency than the Nyquist limit and then
uses signal processing to reconstruct a composite view of a typical pulse. A
similar technique, with analog rather than digital samples, was used before the
digital era in analog sampling oscilloscopes.[18][19]
**** Mixed-signal oscilloscopes[edit] ****
A mixed-signal oscilloscope (or MSO) has two kinds of inputs, a small number of
analog channels (typically two or four), and a larger number of digital
channels(typically sixteen). It provides the ability to accurately time-
correlate analog and digital channels, thus offering a distinct advantage over
a separate oscilloscope and logic analyser. Typically, digital channels may be
grouped and displayed as a bus with each bus value displayed at the bottom of
the display in hex or binary. On most MSOs, the trigger can be set across both
analog and digital channels.
**** Mixed-domain oscilloscopes[edit] ****
A mixed-domain oscilloscope (MDO) is an oscilloscope that comes with an
additional RF input which is solely used for dedicated FFT-based spectrum
analyzer functionality. Often, this RF input offers a higher bandwidth than the
conventional analog input channels. This is in contrast to the FFT
functionality of conventional digital oscilloscopes which use the normal analog
inputs. Some MDOs allow time-correlation of events in the time domain (like a
specific serial data package) with events happening in the frequency domain
(like RF transmissions).
**** Handheld oscilloscopes[edit] ****
Further information: Oscilloscope_types_Â§ Handheld_oscilloscopes
Handheld oscilloscopes are useful for many test and field service applications.
Today, a hand held oscilloscope is usually a digital_sampling_oscilloscope,
using a liquid_crystal display.
Many hand-held and bench oscilloscopes have the ground reference voltage common
to all input channels. If more than one measurement channel is used at the same
time, all the input signals must have the same voltage reference, and the
shared default reference is the "earth". If there is no differential
preamplifier or external signal isolator, this traditional desktop oscilloscope
is not suitable for floating measurements. (Occasionally an oscilloscope user
breaks the ground pin in the power supply cord of a bench-top oscilloscope in
an attempt to isolate the signal common from the earth ground. This practice is
unreliable since the entire stray capacitance of the instrument cabinet
connects into the circuit. It is also a hazard to break a safety ground
connection, and instruction manuals strongly advise against it.)
Some models of oscilloscope have isolated inputs, where the signal reference
level terminals are not connected together. Each input channel can be used to
make a "floating" measurement with an independent signal reference level.
Measurements can be made without tying one side of the oscilloscope input to
the circuit signal common or ground reference.
The isolation available is categorized as shown below:
                     Operating voltage       Peak instantaneous
Overvoltage category (effective value of AC/ voltage (repeated 20 Test resistor
                     DC to ground)           times)
CAT I                600 V                  2500 V              30 Î©
CAT I                1000 V                 4000 V              30 Î©
CAT II               600 V                  4000 V              12 Î©
CAT II               1000 V                 6000 V              12 Î©
CAT III              600 V                  6000 V              2 Î©
**** PC-based oscilloscopes[edit] ****
PicoScope 6000 digital PC-based oscilloscope using a laptop computer for
display & processing
Further information: Oscilloscope_types_Â§ PC-based_oscilloscopes
Some digital oscilloscope rely on a PC platform for display and control of the
instrument. This can be in the form of a standalone oscilloscope with internal
PC platform (PC mainboard), or as external oscilloscope which connects through
USB or LAN to a separate PC or laptop.
**** Related instruments[edit] ****
A large number of instruments used in a variety of technical fields are really
oscilloscopes with inputs, calibration, controls, display calibration, etc.,
specialized and optimized for a particular application. Examples of such
oscilloscope-based instruments include waveform_monitors for analyzing video
levels in television_productions and medical devices such as vital function
monitors and electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram instruments. In
automobile repair, an ignition analyzer is used to show the spark waveforms for
each cylinder. All of these are essentially oscilloscopes, performing the basic
task of showing the changes in one or more input signals over time in an XâY
display.
Other instruments convert the results of their measurements to a repetitive
electrical signal, and incorporate an oscilloscope as a display element. Such
complex measurement systems include spectrum_analyzers, transistor analyzers,
and time_domain_reflectometers (TDRs). Unlike an oscilloscope, these
instruments automatically generate stimulus or sweep a measurement parameter.

   6. ^ The 20 picofarad value is typical for scope bandwidths around 100 MHz;
      for example, a 200 MHz Tektronix 7A26 input impedance is 1M and 22 pF.
      (Tektronix_(1983, p. 271); see also Tektronix_(1998, p. 503), "typical
      high Z 10X passive probe model".) Lower bandwidth scopes used higher
      capacitances; the 1 MHz Tektronix 7A22 input impedance is 1M and 47 pF.
      (Tektronix_1983, pp. 272â273) Higher bandwidth scopes use smaller
      capacitances. The 500 MHz Tektronix TDS510A input impedance is 1M and 10
      pF. (Tektronix_1998, p. 78)
   7. ^ Probes are designed for a specific input impedance. They have
      compensation adjustments with a limited range, so they often cannot be
      used on different input impedances.

  10. ^ Tektronix_(1983, p. 426); Tek claims 300 MHz resistive coax at 30 pF
      per meter; schematic has 5 adjustments.
