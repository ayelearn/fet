The International System of Units (SI, abbreviated from the French SystÃƒÂ¨me
international (d'unitÃƒÂ©s)) is the modern form of the metric_system, and is the
most widely used system_of_measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units
of_measurement built on seven base_units, which are the second, metre,
kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela, and a set of twenty prefixes to the
unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and
fractions of the units. The system also specifies names for 22 derived_units,
such as lumen and watt, for other common physical quantities.
The base units are derived from invariant constants of nature, such as the
speed_of_light in vacuum and the charge_of_the_electron, which can be observed
and measured with great accuracy. The last artefact to be used for this purpose
was the International_Prototype_of_the_Kilogram, a cylinder of platinum-
iridium. Concern regarding its stability led to a revision_of_the_definition_of
the_base_units entirely in terms of constants of nature, which was put into
effect on 20 May 2019.[1]
Derived units may be defined in terms of base units or other derived units.
They are adopted to facilitate measurement of diverse quantities. The SI is
intended to be an evolving system; units and prefixes are created and unit
definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of
measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The most
recent derived unit, the katal, was defined in 1999.
The reliability of the SI depends not only on the precise measurement of
standards for the base units in terms of various physical constants of nature,
but also on precise definition of those constants. The set of underlying
constants is modified as more stable constants are found, or may be more
precisely measured. For example, in 1983 the metre was redefined as the
distance that light propagates in vacuum in a given fraction of a second, thus
making the value of the speed of light in terms of the defined units exact.
The motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that
had sprung up within the centimetreÃ¢Â€Â“gramÃ¢Â€Â“second (CGS) systems (specifically
the inconsistency between the systems of electrostatic_units and
electromagnetic_units) and the lack of coordination between the various
disciplines that used them. The General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures
(French: ConfÃƒÂ©rence gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale des poids et mesures Ã¢Â€Â“ CGPM), which was
established by the Metre_Convention of 1875, brought together many
international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new
system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements.
The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in
1948. It is based on the metreÃ¢Â€Â“kilogramÃ¢Â€Â“second_system_of_units (MKS) rather
than any variant of the CGS.
Since then, the SI has officially been adopted by all countries except the
United_States, Liberia, and Myanmar.[2] Both Myanmar and Liberia make
substantial use of SI units, as do the scientific, military, and medical
communities in the US. Countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and
certain islands in the Caribbean have partially metricated, currently employing
a mixture of SI, imperial, and US Customary units. For instance, road signs in
the United Kingdom continue to use miles whilst produce in Canada and the
United Kingdom continue to, in certain context, be advertised in pounds rather
than kilograms. The incomplete processes of metrication in Canada and the
United_Kingdom illustrate the complex status of metrication internationally
beyond the three countries (US, Myanmar, and Liberia) commonly cited as not
having adopted the SI.

***** Units and prefixes[edit] *****
The International System of Units consists of a set of base_units, derived
units, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as prefixes.[3]:
103Ã¢Â€Â“106 The units, excluding prefixed units,[Note_1] form a coherent_system
of_units, which is based on a system of quantities in such a way that the
equations between the numerical values expressed in coherent units have exactly
the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding equations
between the quantities. For example, 1Â N = 1Â kg ÃƒÂ— 1Â m/s2 says that one newton
is the force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at one metre_per
second_squared, as related through the principle of coherence to the equation
relating the corresponding quantities: F = m ÃƒÂ— a.
Derived units apply to derived quantities, which may by definition be expressed
in terms of base quantities, and thus are not independent; for example,
electrical_conductance is the inverse of electrical_resistance, with the
consequence that the siemens is the inverse of the ohm, and similarly, the ohm
and siemens can be replaced with a ratio of an ampere and a volt, because those
quantities bear a defined relationship to each other.[Note_2] Other useful
derived quantities can be specified in terms of the SI base and derived units
that have no named units in the SI system, such as acceleration, which is
defined in SI units as m/s2.
**** Base units[edit] ****

The SI base units are the building blocks of the system and all the other units
are derived from them.

  Notes
   1. ^ Within the context of the SI, the second is the coherent base unit of time, and is used in the definitions of derived units. The
      name "second" historically arose as being the 2nd-level sexagesimal division (&#x200b;1â„602) of some quantity, the hour in this
      case, which the SI_classifies_as_an_"accepted"_unit along with its first-level sexagesimal division the minute.
   2. ^ Despite the prefix "kilo-", the kilogram is the coherent base unit of mass, and is used in the definitions of derived units.
      Nonetheless, prefixes for the unit of mass are determined as if the gram were the base unit.
   3. ^ When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles,
      or specified groups of such particles.
**** Derived units[edit] ****
Main article: SI_derived_unit
The derived units in the SI are formed by powers, products, or quotients of the
base units and are potentially unlimited in number.[3]:103[4]:9 Derived units
are associated with derived quantities; for example, velocity is a quantity
that is derived from the base quantities of time and length, and thus the SI
derived unit is metre per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units
can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units.
Combinations of base and derived units may be used to express other derived
units. For example, the SI unit of force is the newton (N), the SI unit of
pressure is the pascal (Pa)Ã¢Â€Â”and the pascal can be defined as one newton per
square metre (N/m2).[7]

**** Prefixes[edit] ****
Main article: Metric_prefix
Prefixes are added to unit names to produce multiples and sub-multiples of the
original unit. All of these are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or
below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, kilo-
denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth,
so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to
the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a
metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are
named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a
milligram, not a microkilogram.[3]:122[8]:14 When prefixes are used to form
multiples and submultiples of SI base and derived units, the resulting units
are no longer coherent.[3]:7
The BIPM specifies 20 prefixes for the International System of Units (SI):

**** Non-SI units accepted for use with SI[edit] ****
Main article: Non-SI_units_accepted_for_use_with_SI
Many non-SI units continue to be used in the scientific, technical, and
commercial literature. Some units are deeply embedded in history and culture,
and their use has not been entirely replaced by their SI alternatives. The CIPM
recognised and acknowledged such traditions by compiling a list of non-SI_units
accepted_for_use_with_SI:[3]
While not an SI-unit, the litre may be used with SI units. It is equivalent to
(10â€¯cm)3â€¯=â€¯(1â€¯dm)3â€¯=â€¯10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’3â€¯m3
Some units of time, angle, and legacy non-SI units have a long history of use.
Most societies have used the solar day and its non-decimal subdivisions as a
basis of time and, unlike the foot or the pound, these were the same regardless
of where they were being measured. The radian, being 1/2ÃÂ€ of a revolution, has
mathematical advantages but is rarely used for navigation. Further, the units
used in navigation around the world are similar. The tonne, litre, and hectare
were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be
used alongside SI units, having been given unique symbols. The catalogued units
are given below:

**** Common notions of the metric units[edit] ****
The basic units of the metric system, as originally defined, represented common
quantities or relationships in nature. They still do Ã¢Â€Â“ the modern precisely
defined quantities are refinements of definition and methodology, but still
with the same magnitudes. In cases where laboratory precision may not be
required or available, or where approximations are good enough, the original
definitions may suffice.[Note_3]
    * A second is 1/60 of a minute, which is 1/60 of an hour, which is 1/24 of
      a day, so a second is 1/86400 of a day (the use of base 60 dates back to
      Babylonian times); a second is the time it takes a dense object to freely
      fall 4.9 metres from rest.
    * The length of the equator is close to 40,000,000 metres (more precisely
      40,075,014.2 metres). In fact, the dimensions of our planet were used by
      the French Academy in the original definition of the metre.
    * The metre is close to the length of a pendulum that has a period of 2
      seconds; most dining tabletops are about 0.75 metres high; a very tall
      human (basketball forward) is about 2 metres tall.
    * The kilogram is the mass of a litre of cold water; a cubic centimetre or
      millilitre of water has a mass of one gram; a 1-euro_coin, 7.5Â g; a
      Sacagawea_US_1-dollar_coin, 8.1Â g; a UK_50-pence_coin, 8.0Â g.
    * A candela is about the luminous intensity of a moderately bright candle,
      or 1 candle power; a 60Â W tungsten-filament incandescent light bulb has a
      luminous intensity of about 64 candela.
    * A mole of a substance has a mass that is its molecular_mass expressed in
      units of grams; the mass of a mole of carbon is 12.0Â g, and the mass of a
      mole of table salt is 58.4Â g.
    * A temperature difference of one kelvin is the same as one degree Celsius:
      1/100 of the temperature differential between the freezing and boiling
      points of water at sea level; the absolute temperature in kelvins is the
      temperature in degrees Celsius plus about 273; human body temperature is
      about 37Â Ã‚Â°C or 310Â K.
    * A 60Â W incandescent light bulb consumes 0.5 amperes at 120Â V (US mains
      voltage) and about 0.25 amperes at 240Â V (European mains voltage).
***** Lexicographic conventions[edit] *****
**** Unit names[edit] ****
The symbols for the SI units are intended to be identical, regardless of the
language used,[3]:130Ã¢Â€Â“135 but unit names are ordinary nouns and use the
character set and follow the grammatical rules of the language concerned. Names
of units follow the grammatical rules associated with common_nouns: in English
and in French they start with a lowercase letter (e.g., newton, hertz, pascal),
even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter. This also
applies to "degrees Celsius", since "degree" is the unit.[9][10] The British
and American spellings for certain SI units differ Ã¢Â€Â“ British_English, as well
as Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand English, uses the spelling deca-,
metre, and litre whereas American_English uses the spelling deka-, meter, and
liter, respectively.[4]:3
**** Unit symbols and the values of quantities [edit] ****
Although the writing of unit names is language-specific, the writing of unit
symbols and the values of quantities is consistent across all languages and
therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them.[3]:
130Ã¢Â€Â“135 The guideline produced by the National_Institute_of_Standards_and
Technology (NIST)[11] clarifies language-specific areas in respect of American
English that were left open by the SI Brochure, but is otherwise identical to
the SI Brochure.[12]
*** General rules[edit] ***
General rules[Note_4] for writing SI units and quantities apply to text that is
either handwritten or produced using an automated process:
    * The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space
      (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21Â kg,
      7.3ÃƒÂ—102Â m2, 22Â K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)[3]:
      134 and the symbol for degrees Celsius (Ã‚Â°C).[3]:133 Exceptions are the
      symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (Ã‚Â°,Â â€², andÂ â€³),
      which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.
    * Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not
      have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand
      one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.
    * A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to a unit
      symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz, ÃÂ¼ in
      ÃÂ¼g). Compound prefixes are not allowed. A prefixed unit is atomic in
      expressions (e.g., km2 is equivalent to (km)2).
    * Unit symbols are written using roman (upright) type, regardless of the
      type used in the surrounding text.
    * Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a
      centre_dot (Ã¢Â‹Â…) or a non-breaking space; e.g., NÃ¢Â‹Â…m or NÂ m.
    * Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a solidus (/
      ), or given as a negative exponent. E.g., the "metre per second" can be
      written m/s, mÂ sÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1, mÃ¢Â‹Â…sÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1, or m/s. A solidus must not be used more
      than once in a given expression without parentheses to remove
      ambiguities; e.g., kg/(mÃ¢Â‹Â…s2) and kgÃ¢Â‹Â…mÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1Ã¢Â‹Â…sÃ¢ÂˆÂ’2 are acceptable, but
      kg/m/s2 is ambiguous and unacceptable.
Acceleration due to gravity.
The lowercase letters (neither "metres" nor "seconds" were named after people),
the space between the value and the units, and the superscript "2" to denote
"squared".
    * The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person
      is written in upper_case; otherwise, they are written in lower_case.
      E.g., the unit of pressure is named after Blaise_Pascal, so its symbol is
      written "Pa", but the symbol for mole is written "mol". Thus, "T" is the
      symbol for tesla, a measure of magnetic_field_strength, and "t" the
      symbol for tonne, a measure of mass. Since 1979, the litre may
      exceptionally be written using either an uppercase "L" or a lowercase
      "l", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter "l" to
      the numeral "1", especially with certain typefaces or English-style
      handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States
      "L" be used rather than "l".
    * Symbols do not have a plural form, e.g., 25Â kg, but not 25Â kgs.
    * Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the
      quantities 1Â mW and 1Â MW represent two different quantities (milliwatt
      and megawatt).
    * The symbol for the decimal_marker is either a point or comma on the line.
      In practice, the decimal point is used in most English-speaking countries
      and most of Asia, and the comma in most of Latin_America and in
      continental European_countries.[13]
    * Spaces should be used as a thousands_separator (1000000) in contrast to
      commas or periods (1,000,000 or 1.000.000) to reduce confusion resulting
      from the variation between these forms in different countries.
    * Any line-break inside a number, inside a compound unit, or between number
      and unit should be avoided. Where this is not possible, line breaks
      should coincide with thousands separators.
    * Because the value of "billion" and "trillion" varies_between_languages,
      the dimensionless terms "ppb" (parts per billion) and "ppt" (parts per
      trillion) should be avoided. The SI Brochure does not suggest
      alternatives.
*** Printing SI symbols[edit] ***
The rules covering printing of quantities and units are part of ISO 80000-1:
2009.[14]
Further rules[Note_4] are specified in respect of production of text using
printing_presses, word_processors, typewriters, and the like.
*** Examples of the variety of symbols in use around the world for kilometres
per hour[edit] ***
    * Thailand
    * Germany
    * Belgium
    * United_Kingdom
    * Denmark
    * France
    * India
The denominator "hour" (h) is often translated to the country language:
    * Malaysia
    * Sweden
Countries with historical ties to the United States often mix up the
international "km/h" with the American "MPH":
    * Philippines
    * Samoa
***** International System of Quantities[edit] *****
                              SI Brochure
Cover of brochure The_International_System_of_Units
The CGPM publishes a brochure that defines and presents the SI.[3] Its official
version is in French, in line with the Metre_Convention.[3]:102 It leaves some
scope for local interpretation, particularly regarding names and terms in
different languages.[Note_5][4]
The writing and maintenance of the CGPM brochure is carried out by one of the
committees of the International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures (CIPM). The
definitions of the terms "quantity", "unit", "dimension" etc. that are used in
the SI Brochure are those given in the International_vocabulary_of_metrology.
[15]
Main article: International_System_of_Quantities
The quantities and equations that provide the context in which the SI units are
defined are now referred to as the International_System_of_Quantities (ISQ).
The system is based on the quantities underlying each of the seven base units
of the SI. Other quantities, such as area, pressure, and electrical_resistance,
are derived from these base quantities by clear non-contradictory equations.
The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units.[16] The ISQ
is defined in the international standard ISO/IEC_80000, and was finalised in
2009 with the publication of ISO_80000-1.[17]
***** Realisation of units[edit] *****
Main article: Realisation_(metrology)
Silicon sphere for the Avogadro_project used for measuring the Avogadro
constant to a relative standard_uncertainty of 2ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’8 or less, held by Achim
Leistner.[18]
Metrologists carefully distinguish between the definition of a unit and its
realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it
is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and
reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a
unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the
value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A
description of the mise en pratique[Note_6] of the base units is given in an
electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.[19][3]:168Ã¢Â€Â“169
The published mise en pratique is not the only way in which a base unit can be
determined: the SI Brochure states that "any method consistent with the laws of
physics could be used to realise any SI unit."[3]:111 In the current (2016)
exercise to overhaul_the_definitions_of_the_base_units, various consultative
committees of the CIPM have required that more than one mise en pratique shall
be developed for determining the value of each unit.[citation_needed] In
particular:
    * At least three separate experiments be carried out yielding values having
      a relative standard_uncertainty in the determination of the kilogram of
      no more than 5ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’8 and at least one of these values should be better
      than 2ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’8. Both the Kibble_balance and the Avogadro_project should
      be included in the experiments and any differences between these be
      reconciled.[20][21]
    * When the kelvin is being determined, the relative uncertainty of the
      Boltzmann_constant derived from two fundamentally different methods such
      as acoustic gas thermometry and dielectric constant gas thermometry be
      better than one part in 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’6 and that these values be corroborated by
      other measurements.[22]
***** Evolution of the SI[edit] *****
**** Changes to the SI[edit] ****
The International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures (BIPM) has described SI as
"the modern metric system".[3]:95 Changing technology has led to an evolution
of the definitions and standards that has followed two principal strands Ã¢Â€Â“
changes to SI itself, and clarification of how to use units of measure that are
not part of SI but are still nevertheless used on a worldwide basis.
Since 1960 the CGPM has made a number of changes to the SI to meet the needs of
specific fields, notably chemistry and radiometry. These are mostly additions
to the list of named derived units, and include the mole (symbol mol) for an
amount of substance, the pascal (symbol Pa) for pressure, the siemens (symbol
S) for electrical conductance, the becquerel (symbol Bq) for "activity referred
to a radionuclide", the gray (symbol Gy) for ionising radiation, the sievert
(symbol Sv) as the unit of dose equivalent radiation, and the katal (symbol
kat) for catalytic_activity.[3]:156[23][3]:156[3]:158[3]:159[3]:165
Acknowledging the advancement of precision science at both large and small
scales, the range of defined prefixes pico- (10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’12) to tera- (1012) was
extended to 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’24 to 1024.[3]:152[3]:158[3]:164
The 1960 definition of the standard metre in terms of wavelengths of a specific
emission of the krypton 86 atom was replaced with the distance that light
travels in a vacuum in exactly 1/299792458 second, so that the speed of light
is now an exactly specified constant of nature.
A few changes to notation conventions have also been made to alleviate
lexicographic ambiguities. An analysis under the aegis of CSIRO, published in
2009 by the Royal_Society, has pointed out the opportunities to finish the
realisation of that goal, to the point of universal zero-ambiguity machine
readability.[24]
**** 2019 redefinitions[edit] ****
Dependencies of the SI base units on seven physical_constants, which are
assigned exact numerical values in the 2019 redefinition. Unlike in the
previous definitions, the base units are all derived exclusively from constants
of nature.
Main article: 2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units
After the metre_was_redefined in 1960, the kilogram remained the only SI base
unit directly based on a specific physical artefact, the International
Prototype_of_the_Kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that
was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with
the IPK.[25] During the 2nd and 3rd Periodic Verification of National
Prototypes of the Kilogram, a significant divergence had occurred between the
mass of the IPK and all of its official copies stored around the world: the
copies had all noticeably increased in mass with respect to the IPK. During
extraordinary verifications carried out in 2014 preparatory to redefinition of
metric standards, continuing divergence was not confirmed. Nonetheless, the
residual and irreducible instability of a physical IPK undermined the
reliability of the entire metric system to precision measurement from small
(atomic) to large (astrophysical) scales.
A proposal was made that:
    * In addition to the speed of light, four constants of nature Ã¢Â€Â“ the
      Planck_constant, an elementary_charge, the Boltzmann_constant, and the
      Avogadro_number Ã¢Â€Â“ be defined to have exact values
    * The International Prototype Kilogram be retired
    * The current definitions of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole be

**** The improvisation of units[edit] ****
The units and unit magnitudes of the metric system which became the SI were
improvised piecemeal from everyday physical quantities starting in the mid-18th
century. Only later were they moulded into an orthogonal coherent decimal
system of measurement.
The degree centigrade as a unit of temperature resulted from the scale devised
by Swedish astronomer Anders_Celsius in 1742. His scale counter-intuitively
designated 100 as the freezing point of water and 0 as the boiling point.
Independently, in 1743, the French physicist Jean-Pierre_Christin described a
scale with 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 the boiling point. The
scale became known as the centi-grade, or 100 gradations of temperature, scale.
The metric system was developed from 1791 onwards by a committee of the French
Academy_of_Sciences, commissioned to create a unified and rational system of
measures.[29] The group, which included preeminent French men of science,[30]:
89 used the same principles for relating length, volume, and mass that had been
proposed by the English clergyman John_Wilkins in 1668[31][32] and the concept
of using the Earth's meridian as the basis of the definition of length,
originally proposed in 1670 by the French abbot Mouton.[33][34]
                             Carl_Friedrich_Gauss
In March 1791, the Assembly adopted the committee's proposed principles for the
new decimal system of measure including the metre defined to be 1/10,000,000th
of the length of the quadrant of earth's meridian passing through Paris, and
authorised a survey to precisely establish the length of the meridian. In July
1792, the committee proposed the names metre, are, litre and grave for the
units of length, area, capacity, and mass, respectively. The committee also
proposed that multiples and submultiples of these units were to be denoted by
decimal-based prefixes such as centi for a hundredth and kilo for a thousand.

William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and James Clerk Maxwell played a prominent role
in the development of the principle of coherence and in the naming of many
units of measure.[36][37][38][39][40]
Later, during the process of adoption of the metric system, the Latin gramme
and kilogramme, replaced the former provincial terms gravet (1/1000 grave) and
grave. In June 1799, based on the results of the meridian survey, the standard
mÃƒÂ¨tre_des_Archives and kilogramme_des_Archives were deposited in the French
National_Archives. Subsequently, that year, the metric system was adopted by
law in France.[41] [42] The French system was short-lived due to its
unpopularity. Napoleon ridiculed it, and in 1812, introduced a replacement
system, the mesures usuelles or "customary measures" which restored many of the
old units, but redefined in terms of the metric system.
During the first half of the 19th century there was little consistency in the
choice of preferred multiples of the base units: typically the myriametre
(10000Â metres) was in widespread use in both France and parts of Germany, while
the kilogram (1000 grams) rather than the myriagram was used for mass.[28]
In 1832, the German mathematician Carl_Friedrich_Gauss, assisted by Wilhelm
Weber, implicitly defined the second as a base unit when he quoted the Earth's
magnetic field in terms of millimetres, grams, and seconds.[36] Prior to this,
the strength of the Earth's magnetic field had only been described in relative
terms. The technique used by Gauss was to equate the torque induced on a
suspended magnet of known mass by the Earth's magnetic field with the torque
induced on an equivalent system under gravity. The resultant calculations
enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass, length and time to the magnetic
field.[Note_7][43]
A candlepower as a unit of illuminance was originally defined by an 1860
English law as the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle weighing
&#x200b;1â„6 pound (76 grams) and burning at a specified rate. Spermaceti, a
waxy substance found in the heads of sperm whales, was once used to make high-
quality candles. At this time the French standard of light was based upon the
illumination from a Carcel_oil_lamp. The unit was defined as that illumination
emanating from a lamp burning pure rapeseed_oil at a defined rate. It was
accepted that ten standard candles were about equal to one Carcel lamp.

Main article: Metre_Convention
A French-inspired initiative for international cooperation in metrology led to
the signing in 1875 of the Metre_Convention, also called Treaty of the Metre,
by 17 nations.[Note_9][30]:353Ã¢Â€Â“354 Initially the convention only covered
standards for the metre and the kilogram. In 1921, the Metre Convention was
extended to include all physical units, including the ampere and others thereby
enabling the CGPM to address inconsistencies in the way that the metric system
had been used.[37][3]:96
A set of 30 prototypes of the metre and 40 prototypes of the kilogram,[Note_10]
in each case made of a 90% platinum-10% iridium alloy, were manufactured by
British metallurgy specialty firm and accepted by the CGPM in 1889. One of each
was selected at random to become the International_prototype_metre and
International_prototype_kilogram that replaced the mÃƒÂ¨tre_des_Archives and
kilogramme_des_Archives respectively. Each member state was entitled to one of
each of the remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that
country.[44]
The treaty also established a number of international organisations to oversee
the keeping of international standards of measurement:[45] [46]

In the 1860s, James_Clerk_Maxwell, William_Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and
others working under the auspices of the British_Association_for_the
Advancement_of_Science, built on Gauss's work and formalised the concept of a
coherent system of units with base units and derived units christened the
centimetreÃ¢Â€Â“gramÃ¢Â€Â“second_system_of_units in 1874. The principle of coherence
was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the CGS,
including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the
poise for dynamic_viscosity and the stokes for kinematic_viscosity.[39]
In 1879, the CIPM published recommendations for writing the symbols for length,
area, volume and mass, but it was outside its domain to publish recommendations
for other quantities. Beginning in about 1900, physicists who had been using
the symbol "ÃÂ¼" (mu) for "micrometre" or "micron", "ÃÂ»" (lambda) for
"microlitre", and "ÃÂ³" (gamma) for "microgram" started to use the symbols
"ÃÂ¼m", "ÃÂ¼L" and "ÃÂ¼g".[47]
At the close of the 19th century three different systems of units of measure
existed for electrical measurements: a CGS-based_system_for_electrostatic
units, also known as the Gaussian or ESU system, a CGS-based_system_for
electromechanical_units (EMU) and an International system based on units
defined by the Metre Convention.[48] for electrical distribution systems.
Attempts to resolve the electrical units in terms of length, mass, and time
using dimensional_analysis was beset with difficultiesÃ¢Â€Â”the dimensions
depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems.[40] This anomaly was
resolved in 1901 when Giovanni_Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated
using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth
unit could be chosen to be electric_current, voltage, or electrical_resistance.
[49] Electric current with named unit 'ampere' was chosen as the base unit, and
the other electrical quantities derived from it according to the laws of
physics. This became the foundation of the MKS system of units.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of non-coherent units of
measure based on the gram/kilogram, centimetre/metre, and second, such as the
PferdestÃƒÂ¤rke (metric horsepower) for power,[50][Note_11] the darcy for
permeability[51] and "millimetres_of_mercury" for barometric and blood_pressure
were developed or propagated, some of which incorporated standard_gravity in
their definitions.[Note_12]
At the end of the Second_World_War, a number of different systems of
measurement were in use throughout the world. Some of these systems were metric
system variations; others were based on customary_systems of measure, like the
U.S customary system and Imperial system of the UK and British Empire.

In 1948, the 9th CGPM commissioned a study to assess the measurement needs of
the scientific, technical, and educational communities and "to make
recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable
for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention".[52] This
working document was Practical system of units of measurement. Based on this
study, the 10th CGPM in 1954 defined an international system derived from six
base units including units of temperature and optical radiation in addition to
those for the MKS system mass, length, and time units and Giorgi's current
unit. Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere,
degree Kelvin, and candela.
The 9th CGPM also approved the first formal recommendation for the writing of
symbols in the metric system when the basis of the rules as they are now known
was laid down.[53] These rules were subsequently extended and now cover unit
symbols and names, prefix symbols and names, how quantity symbols should be
written and used, and how the values of quantities should be expressed.[3]:

In 1960, the 11th CGPM synthesised the results of the 12-year study into a set
of 16 resolutions. The system was named the International System of Units,
abbreviated SI from the French name, Le SystÃƒÂ¨me International d'UnitÃƒÂ©s.[3]:

**** Redefinition of the SI system[edit] ****
Main article: 2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units
On 20 May 2019, the redefinition of the SI system in measurement by major
countries came into its effect.
**** Historical definitions[edit] ****
When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified
three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length, and time.
Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit, for which the
unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for
temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity) were added later.
The early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit, while the SI
defines an analogous unit of mass. In everyday use, these are mostly
interchangeable, but in scientific contexts the difference matters. Mass,
strictly the inertial mass, represents a quantity of matter. It relates the
acceleration of a body to the applied force via Newton's_law, F = m ÃƒÂ— a: force
equals mass times acceleration. A force of 1Â N (newton) applied to a mass of
1Â kg will accelerate it at 1Â m/s2. This is true whether the object is floating
in space or in a gravity field e.g. at the Earth's surface. Weight is the force
exerted on a body by a gravitational field, and hence its weight depends on the
strength of the gravitational field. Weight of a 1Â kg mass at the Earth's
surface is m ÃƒÂ— g; mass times the acceleration due to gravity, which is
9.81Â newtons at the Earth's surface and is about 3.5Â newtons at the surface of
Mars. Since the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies by location and
altitude on the Earth, weight is unsuitable for precision measurements of a
property of a body, and this makes a unit of weight unsuitable as a base unit.

      made in both experiment and theory since the 31 December 2010 closing
      date of the 2010 CODATA adjustment, the uncertainties of the 2014
      recommended values of h, e, k, and NA are already at the level required
      for the adoption of the revised SI by the 26th CGPM in the fall of 2018.
      The formal road map to redefinition includes a special CODATA adjustment
      of the fundamental constants with a closing date for new data of 1 July
      2017 in order to determine the exact numerical values of h, e, k, and NA
      that will be used to define the New SI. A second CODATA adjustment with a
      closing date of 1 July 2018 will be carried out so that a complete set of
      recommended values consistent with the New SI will be available when it
      is formally adopted by the 26th CGPM.
