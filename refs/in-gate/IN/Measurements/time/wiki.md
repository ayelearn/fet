The flow of sand in an hourglass can be used to measure the passage of time. It
also concretely represents the present as being between the past and the
future.
Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in
an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, to
the future.[1][2][3] Time is a component quantity of various measurements used
to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between
them, and to quantify rates_of_change of quantities in material_reality or in
the conscious experience.[4][5][6][7] Time is often referred to as a fourth
dimension, along with three_spatial dimensions.[8]
Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and
science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without
circularity has consistently eluded scholars.[2][6][7][9][10][11] Nevertheless,
diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the
performing_arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective
measuring_systems.[12][13][14]
Time_in_physics is unambiguously operationally defined as "what a clock reads".
[6][15][16] See Units_of_Time. Time is one of the seven fundamental physical
quantities in both the International_System_of_Units and International_System
of_Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities â such as velocity â
so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of
definition.[17] An operational_definition of time, wherein one says that
observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical
event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one
standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both
advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition
leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from
the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured.
Investigations of a single continuum called spacetime bring questions about
space into questions about time, questions that have their roots in the works
of early students of natural_philosophy.
Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime
motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion
have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent
motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a
pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time,
the second, is defined by measuring the electronic_transition frequency of
caesium atoms (see below). Time is also of significant social importance,
having economic value ("time_is_money") as well as personal value, due to an
awareness of the limited time in each day and in human_life_spans.

***** Temporal measurement and history *****
Generally speaking, methods of temporal measurement, or chronometry, take two
distinct forms: the calendar, a mathematical tool for organising intervals of
time,[18] and the clock, a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time.
In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas
the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day. Increasingly, personal
electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously. The number
(as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event
as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch â a central
reference point.
**** History of the calendar ****
Main article: Calendar
Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as
early as 6,000 years ago.[19] Lunar_calendars were among the first to appear,
with years of either 12 or 13 lunar_months (either 354 or 384 days). Without
intercalation to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a
calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. Lunisolar_calendars have a
thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a
full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar
months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many
cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years. Other
early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient
Mayan civilization. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based,
with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five epagomenal days at
the end of the year.[20]
The reforms of Julius_Caesar in 45 BC put the Roman_world on a solar_calendar.
This Julian_calendar was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the
astronomical solstices and equinoxes to advance against it by about 11 minutes
per year. Pope_Gregory_XIII introduced a correction in 1582; the Gregorian
calendar was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of
centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used calendar around the
world.
During the French_Revolution, a new clock and calendar were invented in an
attempt to de-Christianize time and create a more rational system in order to
replace the Gregorian calendar. The French_Republican_Calendar's days consisted
of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a
deviation from the 12-based duodecimal system used in many other devices by
many cultures. The system was abolished in 1806.[21]
**** History of time measurement devices ****

Main article: History_of_timekeeping_devices
See also: Clock
A large variety of devices have been invented to measure time. The study of
these devices is called horology.[22]
An Egyptian device that dates to c. 1500 BC, similar in shape to a bent T-
square, measured the passage of time from the shadow cast by its crossbar on a
nonlinear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the
device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening
direction.[23]
A sundial uses a gnomon to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the
hour. The position of the shadow marks the hour in local_time. The idea to
separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their
sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number
12 is due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used
to count the passage of night.[24]
The most precise timekeeping device of the ancient_world was the water_clock,
or clepsydra, one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep
I. They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual
upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The Ancient_Greeks and the people from
Chaldea (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as
an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and
engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the
Middle Ages.[25] In the 11th century, Chinese_inventors and engineers invented
the first mechanical clocks driven by an escapement mechanism.

The hourglass uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time. They were used
in navigation. Ferdinand_Magellan used 18 glasses on each ship for his
circumnavigation of the globe (1522).[26]
Incense sticks and candles were, and are, commonly used to measure time in
temples and churches across the globe. Waterclocks, and later, mechanical
clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the
Middle Ages. Richard_of_Wallingford (1292â1336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey,
famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical orrery about 1330.[27][28]
Great advances in accurate time-keeping were made by Galileo_Galilei and
especially Christiaan_Huygens with the invention of pendulum driven clocks
along with the invention of the minute hand by Jost Burgi.[29]
The English word clock probably comes from the Middle Dutch word klocke which,
in turn, derives from the medieval Latin word clocca, which ultimately derives
from Celtic and is cognate with French, Latin, and German words that mean bell.
The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see
ship's_bell). The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.
Chip-scale atomic_clocks, such as this one unveiled in 2004, are expected to
greatly improve GPS location.[30]
Clocks can range from watches, to more exotic varieties such as the Clock_of
the_Long_Now. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity,
springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of
means such as a pendulum.
Alarm clocks first appeared in ancient Greece around 250 BC with a water clock
that would set off a whistle. This idea was later mechanized by Levi Hutchins
and Seth E. Thomas.[29]
A chronometer is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards.
Initially, the term was used to refer to the marine_chronometer, a timepiece
used to determine longitude by means of celestial_navigation, a precision
firstly achieved by John_Harrison. More recently, the term has also been
applied to the chronometer_watch, a watch that meets precision standards set by
the Swiss agency COSC.
The most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic_clocks, which are accurate to
seconds in many millions of years,[31] and are used to calibrate other clocks
and timekeeping instruments.
Atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic_transitions in certain atoms to
measure the second. One of the atoms used is caesium, most modern atomic clocks
probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron
vibrations.[32] Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its
unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms. SI defines the
second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the
transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the
133Cs atom.
Today, the Global_Positioning_System in coordination with the Network_Time
Protocol can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe.
In medieval philosophical writings, the atom was a unit of time referred to as
the smallest possible division of time. The earliest known occurrence in
English is in Byrhtferth's Enchiridion (a science text) of 1010â1012,[33]
where it was defined as 1/564 of a momentum (1Â½ minutes),[34] and thus equal
to 15/94 of a second. It was used in the computus, the process of calculating
the date of Easter.
As of May 2010[update], the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct
measurements is on the order of 12 attoseconds (1.2 Ã 10â17 seconds), about
3.7 Ã 1026 Planck_times.[35]
**** Units of time ****
See also: Time_(Orders_of_magnitude) and Unit_of_time_Â§ List
The second (s) is the SI base unit. A minute (min) is 60 seconds in length, and
an hour is 60 minutes in length. A day is 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length.
***** Definitions and standards *****
The Mean Solar_Time system defines the second as 1/86,400 of the mean solar
day, which is the year-average of the solar day. The solar day is the time
interval between two successive solar noons, i.e., the time interval between
two successive passages of the Sun across the local meridian. The local
meridian is an imaginary line that runs from celestial north pole to celestial
south pole passing directly over the head of the observer. At the local
meridian the Sun reaches its highest point on its daily arc across the sky.
In 1874 the British Association for the Advancement of Science introduced the
CGS (centimetre/gramme/second system) combining fundamental units of length,
mass and time. The second is "elastic", because tidal friction is slowing the
earth's rotation rate. For use in calculating ephemerides of celestial motion,
therefore, in 1952 astronomers introduced the "ephemeris second", currently
defined as
     the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the tropical_year for 1900 January
     0 at 12 hours ephemeris_time.[36]
The CGS system has been superseded by the SystÃ¨me international. The SI_base
unit for time is the SI second. The International_System_of_Quantities, which
incorporates the SI, also defines larger units of time equal to fixed integer
multiples of one second (1 s), such as the minute, hour and day. These are not
part of the SI, but may be used alongside the SI. Other units of time such as
the month and the year are not equal to fixed multiples of 1 s, and instead
exhibit significant variations in duration.[37]
The official SI definition of the second is as follows:[37][38]
     The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation
     corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of
     the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.
At its 1997 meeting, the CIPM affirmed that this definition refers to a caesium
atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K.[37]
The current definition of the second, coupled with the current definition of
the meter, is based on the special_theory_of_relativity, which affirms our
spacetime to be a Minkowski_space. The definition of the second in mean solar
time, however, is unchanged.
**** World time ****
While in theory, the concept of a single worldwide universal time-scale may
have been conceived of many centuries ago, in practicality the technical
ability to create and maintain such a time-scale did not become possible until
the mid-19th century. The timescale adopted was Greenwich Mean Time, created in
1847. A few countries have replaced it with Coordinated Universal Time, UTC.
*** History of the development of UTC ***
With the advent of the industrial_revolution, a greater understanding and
agreement on the nature of time itself became increasingly necessary and
helpful. In 1847 in Britain, Greenwich_Mean_Time (GMT) was first created for
use by the British railways, the British navy, and the British shipping
industry. Using telescopes, GMT was calibrated to the mean_solar_time at the
Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich in the UK.
As international commerce continued to increase throughout Europe, in order to
achieve a more efficiently functioning modern society, an agreed upon, and
highly accurate international standard of time measurement became necessary. In
order to find or determine such a time-standard, three steps had to be
followed:
   1. An internationally agreed upon time-standard had to be defined.
   2. This new time-standard then had to be consistently and accurately
      measured.
   3. The new time-standard then had to be freely shared and distributed around
      the world.
The development of what is now known as UTC_time began as a collaboration
between 41 nations, officially agreed and signed at the International_Meridian
Conference, in Washington D.C. in 1884. At this conference, the local mean
solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define
the "universal day", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This
agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain
since 1847. In contrast astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. astronomical
day X began at noon of civil day X. The purpose of this was to keep one night's
observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil)
1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least
until 1805 in the Royal_Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere because it was
mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was used for
two-thirds of all charts and maps as their Prime_Meridian.[39]
Among the 41 nations represented at the conference, the advanced time-
technologies that had already come into use in Britain were fundamental
components of the agreed method of arriving at a universal and agreed
international time. In 1928 Greenwich Mean Time was rebranded for scientific
purposes by the International_Astronomical_Union as Universal_Time (UT). This
was to avoid confusion with the previous system in which the day had begun at
noon. As the general public had always begun the day at midnight, the timescale
continued to be presented to them as Greenwich Mean Time. By 1956, universal
time had been split into various versions: UT2, which smoothed for polar motion
and seasonal effects, was presented to the public as Greenwich Mean Time.
Later, UT1 (which smooths only for polar motion) became the default form of UT
used by astronomers and hence the form used in navigation, sunrise and sunset
and moonrise and moonset tables where the name Greenwich Mean Time continues to
be employed. Greenwich Mean Time is also the preferred method of describing the
timescale used by legislators. Even to the present day, UT is still based on an
international telescopic system. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory
itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the
coordinate system. Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly
constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-
based standard like GMT, where the second is defined as 1/86 400 of the mean
solar day.
Until 1960, the methods and definitions of time-keeping that had been laid out
at the International Meridian Conference proved to be adequate to meet time
tracking needs of science. Still, with the advent of the "electronic
revolution" in the latter half of the 20th century, the technologies that had
been available at the time of the Convention of the Metre proved to be in need
of further refinement in order to meet the needs of the ever-increasing
precision that the "electronic revolution" had begun to require.
*** The ephemeris second ***
An invariable second (the "ephemeris second") had been defined, use of which
removed the errors in ephemerides resulting from the use of the variable mean
solar second as the time argument. In 1960 this ephemeris second was made the
basis of the "coordinated universal time" which was being derived from atomic
clocks. It is a specified fraction of the mean tropical year as at 1900 and,
being based on historical telescope observations, corresponds roughly to the
mean solar second of the early nineteenth century.[40]
*** The SI second ***
In 1967 a further step was taken with the introduction of the SI second,
essentially the ephemeris second as measured by atomic clocks and formally
defined in atomic terms.[41] The SI second (Standard Internationale second) is
based directly on the measurement of the atomic-clock observation of the
frequency oscillation of caesium atoms. It is the basis of all atomic
timescales, e.g. coordinated universal time, GPS time, International Atomic
Time, etc. Atomic clocks do not measure nuclear decay rates, which is a common
misconception, but rather measure a certain natural vibrational frequency of
caesium-133.[42] Coordinated universal time is subject to one constraint which
does not affect the other atomic timescales. As it has been adopted as the
civil timescale by some countries (most countries have opted to retain mean
solar time) it is not permitted to deviate from GMT by more than 0.9 second.
This is achieved by the occasional insertion of a leap second.
*** Current application of UTC ***
Most countries use mean solar time. Australia, Canada (Quebec only), Colombia,
France, Germany, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea (Bougainville only), Paraguay,
Portugal, Switzerland, the United States and Venezuela use UTC. However, UTC is
widely used by the scientific community in countries where mean solar time is
official. UTC_time is based on the SI second, which was first defined in 1967,
and is based on the use of atomic clocks. Some other less used but closely
related time-standards include International_Atomic_Time_(TAI), Terrestrial
Time, and Barycentric_Dynamical_Time.
Between 1967 and 1971, UTC was periodically adjusted by fractional amounts of a
second in order to adjust and refine for variations in mean solar time, with
which it is aligned. After 1 January 1972, UTC time has been defined as being
offset from atomic time by a whole number of seconds, changing only when a leap
second is added to keep radio-controlled clocks synchronized with the rotation
of the Earth.
The Global_Positioning_System also broadcasts a very precise time signal
worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC. GPS-time is
based on, and regularly synchronized with or from, UTC-time.
The surface of the Earth is split up into a number of time_zones. Most time
zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as
an offset from GMT. For example, time zones at sea are based on GMT. In many
locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to daylight
saving_time transitions.
**** Time conversions ****
These conversions are accurate at the millisecond level for time systems based
on the rotation of the Earth (UT1 and TT). Conversions between atomic time
systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are accurate at the microsecond level.

**** Sidereal time ****
Main article: Sidereal_time
Further information: Earth's_rotation, Diurnal_motion, and Hour_circle
Unlike solar_time, which is relative to the apparent_position of the Sun,
sidereal_time is the measurement of time relative to that of a distant_star. In
astronomy, sidereal time is used to predict when a star will reach its highest
point in the sky. Due to Earth's_orbital motion around the Sun, a mean solar
day is about 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a mean sidereal day, or
&#x200b;1⁄366 more than a mean sidereal day.
**** Chronology ****
Main article: Chronology
Another form of time measurement consists of studying the past. Events in the
past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a chronology), and can be put into
chronological groups (periodization). One of the most important systems of
periodization is the geologic_time_scale, which is a system of periodizing the
events that shaped the Earth and its life. Chronology, periodization, and
interpretation of the past are together known as the study of history.
**** Time-like concepts: terminology ****
The term "time" is generally used for many close but different concepts,
including:
    * instant[43] as an object â one point on the time axes. Being an object,
      it has no value;
    * time_interval[44] as an object â part of the time axes limited by two
      instants. Being an object, it has no value;
    * date[45] as a quantity characterising an instant. As a quantity, it has a
      value which may be expressed in a variety of ways, for example "2014-04-
      26T09:42:36,75" in ISO_standard format, or more colloquially such as
      "today, 9:42 a.m.";
    * duration[46] as a quantity characterizing a time interval.[47] As a
      quantity, it has a value, such as a number of minutes, or may be
      described in terms of the quantities (such as times and dates) of its
      beginning and end.

**** Linear and cyclical time ****
See also: Time_cycles and Wheel_of_time
Ancient cultures such as Incan, Mayan, Hopi, and other Native American Tribes
â plus the Babylonians, Ancient_Greeks, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and
others â have a concept of a wheel_of_time: they regard time as cyclical and
quantic,[clarification_needed] consisting of repeating ages that happen to
every being of the Universe between birth and extinction.[citation_needed]
In general, the Islamic and Judeo-Christian world-view regards time as linear
[48] and directional,[49] beginning with the act of creation by God. The
traditional Christian view sees time ending, teleologically,[50] with the
eschatological end of the present order of things, the "end_time".
In the Old_Testament book Ecclesiastes, traditionally ascribed to Solomon
(970â928 BC), time (as the Hebrew word ×¢×××, ××× `iddan(age, as in
"Ice age") zÄman(time) is often translated) was traditionally regarded[by
whom?] as a medium for the passage of predestined events.[citation_needed]
(Another word, Ø²ÙØ§Ù" ×××" zamÄn, meant time fit for an event, and is
used as the modern Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew equivalent to the English word
"time".)
**** Time in Greek mythology ****
The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, Chronos and Kairos. The
former refers to numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally "the
right or opportune moment", relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine
time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as opposed to quantitative.[51]
In Greek mythology, Chronos (Ancient Greek: Î§ÏÏÎ½Î¿Ï) is identified as the
Personification of Time. His name in Greek means "time" and is alternatively
spelled Chronus (Latin spelling) or Khronos. Chronos is usually portrayed as an
old, wise man with a long, gray beard, such as "Father Time". Some English
words whose etymological root is khronos/chronos include chronology,
chronometer, chronic, anachronism, synchronise, and chronicle.
**** Time in Kabbalah ****
According to Kabbalists, "time" is a paradox[52] and an illusion.[53] Both the
future and the past are recognised to be combined and simultaneously present.

***** Philosophy *****
Main articles: Philosophy_of_space_and_time and Temporal_finitism
Time's mortal aspect is personified in this bronze statue by Charles_van_der
Stappen.
Two contrasting viewpoints on time divide prominent philosophers. One view is
that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe â a dimension
independent of events, in which events occur in sequence. Isaac_Newton
subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as
Newtonian_time.[54][55] The opposing view is that time does not refer to any
kind of "container" that events and objects "move through", nor to any entity
that "flows", but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual
structure (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and
compare events. This second view, in the tradition of Gottfried_Leibniz[15] and
Immanuel_Kant,[56][57] holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and
thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled.
Furthermore, it may be that there is a subjective component to time, but
whether or not time itself is "felt", as a sensation, or is a judgment, is a
matter of debate.[2][6][7][58][59]
In Philosophy, time was questioned throughout the centuries; what time is and
if it is real or not. Ancient Greek philosophers asked if time was linear or
cyclical and if time was endless or finite.[60] These philosophers had
different ways of explaining time; for instance, ancient Indian philosophers
had something called the Wheel_of_Time. It is believed that there was repeating
ages over the lifespan of the universe.[61] This led to beliefs like cycles of
rebirth and reincarnation.[61] The Greek philosophers believe that the universe
was infinite, and was an illusion to humans.[61] Plato believed that time was
made by the Creator at the same instant as the heavens.[61] He also says that
time is a period of motion of the heavenly_bodies.[61] Aristotle believed that
time correlated to movement, that time did not exist on its own but was
relative to motion of objects.[61] he also believed that time was related to
the motion of celestial_bodies; the reason that humans can tell time was
because of orbital_periods and therefore there was a duration on time.[62]
The Vedas, the earliest texts on Indian_philosophy and Hindu_philosophy dating
back to the late 2nd_millennium_BC, describe ancient Hindu_cosmology, in which
the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction and rebirth,
with each cycle lasting 4,320 million years.[63] Ancient Greek_philosophers,
including Parmenides and Heraclitus, wrote essays on the nature of time.[64]
Plato, in the Timaeus, identified time with the period of motion of the
heavenly bodies. Aristotle, in Book IV of his Physica defined time as 'number
of movement in respect of the before and after'.[65]
In Book 11 of his Confessions, St._Augustine_of_Hippo ruminates on the nature
of time, asking, "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to
explain it to one that asketh, I know not." He begins to define time by what it
is not rather than what it is,[66] an approach similar to that taken in other
negative_definitions. However, Augustine ends up calling time a "distention" of
the mind (Confessions 11.26) by which we simultaneously grasp the past in
memory, the present by attention, and the future by expectation.
Isaac_Newton believed in absolute space and absolute time; Leibniz believed
that time and space are relational.[67] The differences between Leibniz's and
Newton's interpretations came to a head in the famous LeibnizâClarke
correspondence.
Philosophers in the 17th and 18th century questioned if time was real and
absolute, or if it was an intellectual concept that humans use to understand
and sequence events.[60] These questions lead to realism vs anti-realism; the
realists believed that time is a fundamental part of the universe, and be
perceived by a events happening in a sequence, in a dimension.[68] Isaac_Newton
said that we are merely occupying time, he also says that humans can only
understand relative_time.[68] Relative time is a measurement of objects in
motion.[68] The anti-realists believed that time is merely a convenient
intellectual concept for humans to understand events.[68] This means that time
was useless unless there were objects that it could interact with, this was
called relational_time.[68] RenÃ©_Descartes, John_Locke, and David_Hume said
that your mind needs to acknowledge time, in order to understand what time is.
[62] Immanuel_Kant believed that we can not know what something is unless we
experience it first hand.[69]
Time is not an empirical concept. For neither co-existence nor succession would
be perceived by us, if the representation of time did not exist as a foundation
a priori. Without this presupposition we could not represent to ourselves that
things exist together at one and the same time, or at different times, that is,
contemporaneously, or in succession.
Immanuel_Kant, Critique_of_Pure_Reason (1781), trans. Vasilis_Politis (London:
Dent., 1991), p.54.
Immanuel_Kant, in the Critique_of_Pure_Reason, described time as an a_priori
intuition that allows us (together with the other a priori intuition, space) to
comprehend sense_experience.[70] With Kant, neither space nor time are
conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental
framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or
observing subject. Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract
conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence
events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this
view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that "flows," that objects
"move through," or that is a "container" for events. Spatial measurements are
used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal
measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events. Time was
designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category.
Henri_Bergson believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor a
mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as Duration. Duration, in
Bergson's view, was creativity and memory as an essential component of reality.
[71]
According to Martin_Heidegger we do not exist inside time, we are time. Hence,
the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which
allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the
state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is
related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes
"being ahead of oneself" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this
concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the
present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of
quantitative. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear
relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended.[72] We
are not stuck in sequential time. We are able to remember the past and project
into the future â we have a kind of random access to our representation of
temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential
time.[73]
Modern philosophers asked: is time real or unreal, is time happening all at
once or a duration, If time tensed or tenseless, and is there a future to be?
[60] There is a theory called the tenseless or B-theory; this theory says that
any tensed terminology can be replaced with tenseless terminology.[74] For
example, âwe will win the gameâ can be replaced with âwe do win the
gameâ, taking out the future tense. On the other hand, there is a theory
called the tense or A-theory; this theory says that our language has tense
verbs for a reason and that the future can not be determined.[74] There is also
something called imaginary time, this was from Stephen_Hawking, he says that
space and imaginary time are finite but have no boundaries.[74] Imaginary_time
is not real or unreal, it is something that is hard to visualize.[74]
Philosophers can agree that physical time exists outside of the human mind and
is objective, and psychological time is mind dependent and subjective.[62]
**** Time as "unreal" ****
In 5th century BC Greece, Antiphon the Sophist, in a fragment preserved from
his chief work On Truth, held that: "Time is not a reality (hypostasis), but a
concept (noÃªma) or a measure (metron)." Parmenides went further, maintaining
that time, motion, and change were illusions, leading to the paradoxes of his
follower Zeno.[75] Time as an illusion is also a common theme in Buddhist
thought.[76][77]
J.M.E._McTaggart's 1908 The_Unreality_of_Time argues that, since every event
has the characteristic of being both present and not present (i.e., future or
past), that time is a self-contradictory idea (see also The_flow_of_time).
These arguments often center on what it means for something to be unreal.
Modern physicists generally believe that time is as real as space â though
others, such as Julian_Barbour in his book The_End_of_Time, argue that quantum
equations of the universe take their true form when expressed in the timeless
realm containing every possible now or momentary configuration of the universe,
called 'platonia' by Barbour.[78]
A modern philosophical theory called presentism views the past and the future
as human-mind interpretations of movement instead of real parts of time (or
"dimensions") which coexist with the present. This theory rejects the existence
of all direct interaction with the past or the future, holding only the present
as tangible. This is one of the philosophical arguments against time travel.
This contrasts with eternalism (all time: present, past and future, is real)
and the growing_block_theory (the present and the past are real, but the future
is not).

Main article: Time_in_physics
Until Einstein's reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time
and space, time was considered to be the same everywhere in the universe, with
all observers measuring the same time interval for any event.[79] Non-
relativistic classical_mechanics is based on this Newtonian idea of time.
Einstein, in his special_theory_of_relativity,[80] postulated the constancy and
finiteness of the speed of light for all observers. He showed that this
postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two
events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time
intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion
relative to an inertial observer.
The theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in Minkowski
spacetime, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space
with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be
measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a light-year is
a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light
travels in a certain amount of time. Two events in Minkowski spacetime are
separated by an invariant_interval, which can be either space-like, light-like,
or time-like. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in
any frame_of_reference, there must be a temporal component (and possibly a
spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will
be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference
in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may
calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events,
but the invariant interval between the events is independent of the observer
(and his or her velocity).
**** Classical mechanics ****
In non-relativistic classical_mechanics, Newton's concept of "relative,
apparent, and common time" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for
the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion
relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works
sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's
experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems
with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of
electricity and magnetism. Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a
method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the
maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the result that observers in
motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same
event.
Two-dimensional space depicted in three-dimensional spacetime. The past and
future light_cones are absolute, the "present" is a relative concept different
for observers in relative motion.
**** Spacetime ****
Main article: Spacetime
Time has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging
into spacetime in Einstein's special_relativity and general_relativity.
According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the spatial
reference_frame_of_the_observer, and the human perception as well as the
measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in
relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through
space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in
the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the
same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought
processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary
observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the
direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move
very slowly.
On the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer
as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because
both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other.
Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew
perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the
stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact
that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's;
what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the
stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the
past is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the
future is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.[81][82]
**** Time dilation ****
Relativity_of_simultaneity: Event B is simultaneous with A in the green
reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and occurs later in
the red frame.
Main article: Time_dilation
Einstein showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different
speeds, while agreeing on cause_and_effect, measure different time separations
between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between
non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the
human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at
speeds approaching the speed of light. Subatomic_particles exist for a well
known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when
travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and
exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the special_theory_of
relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame_of_reference, it exists, on the
average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean_lifetime, and the
distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero.
Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to "slow down" for the
particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten.
Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or
"warped") by high-speed motion.
Einstein (The Meaning of Relativity): "Two events taking place at the points A
and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when
observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as
the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which
register the same simultaneously."
Einstein wrote in his book, Relativity, that simultaneity_is_also_relative,
i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular
inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second
observer in a different inertial frame of reference.
**** Relativistic time versus Newtonian time ****
Views of spacetime along the world_line of a rapidly accelerating observer in a
relativistic universe. The events ("dots") that pass the two diagonal lines in
the bottom half of the image (the past light_cone of the observer in the
origin) are the events visible to the observer.
The animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and
the relativistic descriptions. At the heart of these differences are the
Galilean and Lorentz_transformations applicable in the Newtonian and
relativistic theories, respectively.
In the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction
indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the
thick dashed curve is the spacetime trajectory ("world_line") of the observer.
The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime.
The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative
velocity to the observer. Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime
changes when the observer accelerates.
In the Newtonian description these changes are such that time is absolute:[83]
the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the
'now' (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer).
However, in the relativistic description the observability of events is
absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event
passes the "light_cone" of the observer. Notice that with the change from a
Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of absolute time is no
longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the
acceleration of the observer.
**** Arrow of time ****
Main article: Arrow_of_time
Time appears to have a direction â the past lies behind, fixed and immutable,
while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part
the laws of physics do not specify an arrow_of_time, and allow any process to
proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time
being modelled by a parameter in the system being analysed, where there is no
"proper time": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary.
Examples of this include the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from
the Big_Bang, CPT_symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light
only travelling forwards in time (see light_cone). In particle_physics, the
violation_of_CP_symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing
time asymmetry to preserve CPT_symmetry as stated above. The standard
description of measurement in quantum_mechanics is also time asymmetric (see
Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics). The second_law_of_thermodynamics states that
entropy must increase over time (see Entropy). This can be in either direction
â Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in
entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time. So
entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy
universe is a statistical aberration, in the similar manner as tossing a coin
often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row. However,
this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment.[84]
**** Quantized time ****
See also: Chronon
Time quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical
theories (the Standard_Model of Particles and Interactions and General
Relativity) time is not quantized.
Planck_time (~ 5.4 Ã 10â44 seconds) is the unit of time in the system of
natural_units known as Planck_units. Current established physical theories are
believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck
time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in
principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist; see
for instance loop_quantum_gravity.
***** Time travel *****
Main article: Time_travel
See also: Time_travel_in_fiction, Wormhole, and Twin_paradox
Time travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points
in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the
normal "flow" of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in
time (including future times) "persist" in some way. Time travel has been a
plot_device in fiction since the 19th century. Travelling backwards in time has
never been verified, presents many theoretical problems, and may be an
impossibility.[85] Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical,
that is used to achieve time travel is known as a time_machine.
A central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of causality;
should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a
temporal_paradox. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting
the possibility of travel between branch_points, parallel_realities, or
universes.
Another solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that
such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated
in numerous works of fiction, free_will either ceases to exist in the past or
the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be
possible to enact the grandfather_paradox because it is a historical fact that
your grandfather was not killed before his child (your parent) was conceived.
This view doesn't simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but

***** Time perception *****
Philosopher and psychologist William_James
Main article: Time_perception
The specious_present refers to the time duration wherein one's perceptions are
considered to be in the present. The experienced present is said to be
âspeciousâ in that, unlike the objective present, it is an interval and not
a durationless instant. The term specious present was first introduced by the
psychologist E.R._Clay, and later developed by William_James.[86]
**** Biopsychology ****
The brain's judgment of time is known to be a highly distributed system,
including at least the cerebral_cortex, cerebellum and basal_ganglia as its
components. One particular component, the suprachiasmatic_nuclei, is
responsible for the circadian_(or_daily)_rhythm, while other cell clusters
appear capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping.
Psychoactive drugs can impair the judgment of time. Stimulants can lead both
humans and rats to overestimate time intervals,[87][88] while depressants can
have the opposite effect.[89] The level of activity in the brain of
neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine may be the reason for
this.[90] Such chemicals will either excite or inhibit the firing of neurons in
the brain, with a greater firing rate allowing the brain to register the
occurrence of more events within a given interval (speed up time) and a
decreased firing rate reducing the brain's capacity to distinguish events
occurring within a given interval (slow down time).[91]
Mental_chronometry is the use of response time in perceptual-motor tasks to
infer the content, duration, and temporal sequencing of cognitive operations.
**** Development of awareness and understanding of time in children ****
Children's expanding cognitive abilities allow them to understand time more
clearly. Two- and three-year-olds' understanding of time is mainly limited to
"now and not now." Five- and six-year-olds can grasp the ideas of past,
present, and future. Seven- to ten-year-olds can use clocks and calendars.[92]
**** Alterations ****
In addition to psychoactive drugs, judgments of time can be altered by temporal
illusions (like the kappa_effect),[93] age,[94] and hypnosis.[95] The sense of
time is impaired in some people with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's
disease and attention_deficit_disorder.
Psychologists assert that time seems to go faster with age, but the literature
on this age-related perception of time remains controversial.[96] Those who
support this notion argue that young people, having more excitatory
neurotransmitters, are able to cope with faster external events.[91]
***** Use of time *****
See also: Time_management and Time_discipline
In sociology and anthropology, time_discipline is the general name given to
social and economic rules, conventions, customs, and expectations governing the
measurement of time, the social_currency and awareness of time measurements,
and people's expectations concerning the observance of these customs by others.
Arlie_Russell_Hochschild[97][98] and Norbert_Elias[99] have written on the use
of time from a sociological perspective.
The use of time is an important issue in understanding human_behavior,
education, and travel_behavior. Time-use_research is a developing field of
study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of
activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use
changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new
opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use
are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time
spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been
observed to be about 20â30 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over
a long period.
Time_management is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how
much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events
that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate
amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time
management tools.
***** Sequence of events *****
A sequence of events, or series of events, is a sequence of items, facts,
events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order
(chronological order), often with causality relationships among the items.[100]
[101][102] Because of causality, cause precedes effect, or cause and effect may
appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause. A sequence
of events can be presented in text, tables, charts, or timelines. The
description of the items or events may include a timestamp. A sequence of
events that includes the time along with place or location information to
describe a sequential path may be referred to as a world_line.
Uses of a sequence of events include stories,[103] historical events
(chronology), directions and steps in procedures,[104] and timetables for
scheduling activities. A sequence of events may also be used to help describe
processes in science, technology, and medicine. A sequence of events may be
focused on past events (e.g., stories, history, chronology), on future events
that must be in a predetermined order (e.g., plans, schedules, procedures,
timetables), or focused on the observation of past events with the expectation
that the events will occur in the future (e.g., processes, projections). The
use of a sequence of events occurs in fields as diverse as machines (cam
timer), documentaries (Seconds_From_Disaster), law (choice_of_law), computer
simulation (discrete_event_simulation), and electric_power_transmission[105]
(sequence_of_events_recorder). A specific example of a sequence of events is
the timeline_of_the_Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster.
***** Spatial conceptualization of time *****
Although time is regarded as an abstract concept, there is increasing evidence
that time is conceptualized in the mind in terms of space.[106] That is,
instead of thinking about time in a general, abstract way, humans think about
time in a spatial way and mentally organize it as such. Using space to think
about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal events in a specific
way.
This spatial representation of time is often represented in the mind as a
Mental Time Line (MTL).[107] Using space to think about time allows humans to
mentally organize temporal order. These origins are shaped by many
environmental factors[106]ââfor example, literacy appears to play a large
role in the different types of MTLs, as reading/writing_direction provides an
everyday temporal orientation that differs from culture to culture.[107] In
western cultures, the MTL may unfold rightward (with the past on the left and
the future on the right) since people read and write from left to right.[107]
Western calendars also continue this trend by placing the past on the left with
the future progressing toward the right. Conversely, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and
Israeli-Hebrew speakers read from right to left, and their MTLs unfold leftward
(past on the right with future on the left), and evidence suggests these
speakers organize time events in their minds like this as well.[107]
This linguistic evidence that abstract concepts are based in spatial concepts
also reveals that the way humans mentally organize time events varies across
culturesââthat is, a certain specific mental organization system is not
universal. So, although Western cultures typically associate past events with
the left and future events with the right according to a certain MTL, this kind
of horizontal, egocentric MTL is not the spatial organization of all cultures.
Although most developed nations use an egocentric spatial system, there is
recent evidence that some cultures use an allocentric spatialization, often
based on environmental features.[106]
A recent study of the indigenous Yupno people of Papua_New_Guinea focused on
the directional gestures used when individuals used time-related words.[106]
When speaking of the past (such as "last year" or "past times"), individuals
gestured downhill, where the river of the valley flowed into the ocean. When
speaking of the future, they gestured uphill, toward the source of the river.
This was common regardless of which direction the person faced, revealing that
the Yupno people may use an allocentric MTL, in which time flows uphill.[106]
A similar study of the Pormpuraawans, an aboriginal_group in Australia,
revealed a similar distinction in which when asked to organize photos of a man
aging "in order," individuals consistently placed the youngest photos to the
east and the oldest photos to the west, regardless of which direction they
faced.[108] This directly clashed with an American group which consistently
organized the photos from left to right. Therefore, this group also appears to
have an allocentric MTL, but based on the cardinal directions instead of
geographical features.[108]
The wide array of distinctions in the way different groups think about time
leads to the broader question that different groups may also think about other
abstract concepts in different ways as well, such as causality and number.[106]

      Leibniz finds the idea that space and time might be substances or
      substance-like absurd (see, for example, "Correspondence with Clarke,"
      Leibniz's Fourth Paper, Â§8ff). In short, an empty space would be a
      substance with no properties; it will be a substance that even God cannot
      modify or destroy.... That is, space and time are internal or intrinsic
      features of the complete concepts of things, not extrinsic.... Leibniz's
      view has two major implications. First, there is no absolute location in
      either space or time; location is always the situation of an object or
      event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time are
      not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are,
      rather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways
      of perceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are
      phenomena or, strictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions
      that are well-founded upon the internal properties of substances).... It
      is sometimes convenient to think of space and time as something "out
      there," over and above the entities and their relations to each other,
      but this convenience must not be confused with reality. Space is nothing
      but the order of co-existent objects; time nothing but the order of
      successive events. This is usually called a relational theory of space
      and time.

      increasingly in the profane and a sense of history developed, the desire
      to escape into the sacred began to drop in the background. The myths,
      tied up with cyclic time, were not so easily operative. [...] So secular
      man became content with his linear time. He could not return to cyclic
      time and re-enter sacred space though its myths. [...] Just here, as
      Eliade sees it, a new religious structure became available. In the
      Judaeo-Christian religions â Judaism, Christianity, Islam â history
      is taken seriously, and linear time is accepted. The cyclic time of the
      primordial mythical consciousness has been transformed into the time of
      profane man, but the mythical consciousness remains. It has been
      historicized. The Christian mythos and its accompanying ritual are bound
      up, for example, with history and center in authentic history, especially
      the Christ-event. Sacred space, the Transcendent Presence, is thus opened
      up to secular man because it meets him where he is, in the linear flow of
      secular time. The Christian myth gives such time a beginning in creation,
      a center in the Christ-event, and an end in the final consummation.

      Respect to Timeâ or as âAbsolutism with Respect to Timeâ, has been
      defended by Plato, Newton, and others. On this view, time is like an

      that exists independently of whether or not anything is placed in it.

      its anti-metaphysical stance. Space and time do not exist in and of
      themselves, but in some sense are the product of the way we represent
      things. The[y] are ideal, though not in the sense in which Leibniz
      thought they are ideal (figments of the imagination). The ideality of
      space is its mind-dependence: it is only a condition of sensibility....
      Kant concluded ... "absolute space is not an object of outer sensation;
      it is rather a fundamental concept which first of all makes possible all
      such outer sensation."...Much of the argumentation pertaining to space is
      applicable, mutatis mutandis, to time, so I will not rehearse the
      arguments. As space is the form of outer intuition, so time is the form
      of inner intuition.... Kant claimed that time is real, it is "the real
      form of inner intuition."

      also necessary as a form or condition of our intuitions of objects. The
      idea of time itself cannot be gathered from experience because succession
      and simultaneity of objects, the phenomena that would indicate the
      passage of time, would be impossible to represent if we did not already
      possess the capacity to represent objects in time.... Another way to put
      the point is to say that the fact that the mind of the knower makes the a
      priori contribution does not mean that space and time or the categories
      are mere figments of the imagination. Kant is an empirical realist about
      the world we experience; we can know objects as they appear to us. He
      gives a robust defense of science and the study of the natural world from
      his argument about the mind's role in making nature. All discursive,
      rational beings must conceive of the physical world as spatially and
      temporally unified, he argues.
