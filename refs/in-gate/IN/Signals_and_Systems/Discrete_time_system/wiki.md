****** Discrete system ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
A discrete system is a system with a countable number of states. Discrete
systems may be contrasted with continuous systems, which may also be called
analog systems. A final discrete system is often modeled with a directed graph
and is analyzed for correctness and complexity according to computational
theory. Because discrete systems have a countable number of states, they may be
described in precise mathematical_models.
A computer is a finite_state_machine that may be viewed as a discrete system.
Because computers are often used to model not only other discrete systems but
continuous systems as well, methods have been developed to represent real-world
continuous systems as discrete systems. One such method involves sampling a
continuous signal at discrete_time intervals.
