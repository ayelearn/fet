An inductor, also called a coil, choke, or reactor, is a passive two-terminal
electrical_component that stores energy in a magnetic_field when electric
current flows through it.[1] An inductor typically consists of an insulated
wire wound into a coil around a core.
When the current flowing through an inductor changes, the time-varying magnetic
field induces an electromotive_force (e.m.f.) (voltage) in the conductor,
described by Faraday's_law_of_induction. According to Lenz's_law, the induced
voltage has a polarity (direction) which opposes the change in current that
created it. As a result, inductors oppose any changes in current through them.
An inductor is characterized by its inductance, which is the ratio of the
voltage to the rate of change of current. In the International_System_of_Units
(SI), the unit of inductance is the henry (H) named for 19th century American
scientist Joseph_Henry. In the measurement of magnetic circuits, it is
equivalent to weber/ampere. Inductors have values that typically range from
1 ÂµH (10â6 H) to 20 H. Many inductors have a magnetic_core made of iron or
ferrite inside the coil, which serves to increase the magnetic field and thus
the inductance. Along with capacitors and resistors, inductors are one of the
three passive linear circuit_elements that make up electronic circuits.
Inductors are widely used in alternating_current (AC) electronic equipment,
particularly in radio equipment. They are used to block AC while allowing DC to
pass; inductors designed for this purpose are called chokes. They are also used
in electronic_filters to separate signals of different frequencies, and in
combination with capacitors to make tuned_circuits, used to tune radio and TV
receivers.

***** Description[edit] *****
An electric current flowing through a conductor generates a magnetic field
surrounding it. The magnetic_flux_linkage      &#x03A6;   B      {\displaystyle
\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}  [{\displaystyle \Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}] generated by a
given current     I   {\displaystyle I}  [I] depends on the geometric shape of
the circuit. Their ratio defines the inductance     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L].
[2][3][4][5] Thus
         L :=    &#x03A6;   B    I     {\displaystyle L:={\frac {\Phi _{\mathbf
      {B} }}{I}}}  [{\displaystyle L:={\frac {\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{I}}}].
The inductance of a circuit depends on the geometry of the current path as well
as the magnetic_permeability of nearby materials. An inductor is a component
consisting of a wire or other conductor shaped to increase the magnetic flux
through the circuit, usually in the shape of a coil or helix. Winding the wire
into a coil increases the number of times the magnetic_flux lines link the
circuit, increasing the field and thus the inductance. The more turns, the
higher the inductance. The inductance also depends on the shape of the coil,
separation of the turns, and many other factors. By adding a "magnetic core"
made of a ferromagnetic material like iron inside the coil, the magnetizing
field from the coil will induce magnetization in the material, increasing the
magnetic flux. The high permeability of a ferromagnetic core can increase the
inductance of a coil by a factor of several thousand over what it would be
without it.
**** Constitutive equation[edit] ****
Any change in the current through an inductor creates a changing flux, inducing
a voltage across the inductor. By Faraday's_law_of_induction, the voltage
induced by any change in magnetic flux through the circuit is given by[5]
           E   = &#x2212;    d  &#x03A6;   B      d t      {\displaystyle
      {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {d\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{dt}}}  [{\displaystyle
      {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {d\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{dt}}}].
Reformulating the definition of     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] above, we obtain
[5]
          &#x03A6;   B    = L I   {\displaystyle \Phi _{\mathbf {B} }=LI}  [
      {\displaystyle \Phi _{\mathbf {B} }=LI}].
It follows, that
           E   = &#x2212;    d  &#x03A6;   B      d t    = &#x2212;   d  d t
      ( L I ) = &#x2212; L    d I   d t      {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-
      {\frac {d\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{dt}}=-{\frac {d}{dt}}(LI)=-L{\frac {dI}
      {dt}}}  [{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {d\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}
      {dt}}=-{\frac {d}{dt}}(LI)=-L{\frac {dI}{dt}}}].
for     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] independent of time.
So inductance is also a measure of the amount of electromotive_force (voltage)
generated for a given rate of change of current. For example, an inductor with
an inductance of 1 henry produces an EMF of 1 volt when the current through the
inductor changes at the rate of 1 ampere per second. This is usually taken to
be the constitutive_relation (defining equation) of the inductor.
The dual of the inductor is the capacitor, which stores_energy_in_an_electric
field rather than a magnetic field. Its currentâvoltage relation is obtained
by exchanging current and voltage in the inductor equations and replacing L
with the capacitance C.
**** Lenz's law[edit] ****
Main article: Lenz's_Law
The polarity (direction) of the induced voltage is given by Lenz's_law, which
states that the induced voltage will be such as to oppose the change in
current.[6] For example, if the current through an inductor is increasing, the
induced voltage will be positive at the current's entrance point and negative
at the exit point, tending to oppose the additional current.[7][8][9] The
energy from the external circuit necessary to overcome this potential "hill" is
being stored in the magnetic field of the inductor. If the current is
decreasing, the induced voltage will be negative at the current's entrance
point and positive at the exit point, tending to maintain the current. In this
case energy from the magnetic field is being returned to the circuit.
**** Energy stored in an inductor[edit] ****
One intuitive explanation as to why a potential difference is induced on a
change of current in an inductor goes as follows:
When there is a change in current through an inductor there is a change in the
strength of the magnetic field. For example, if the current is increased, the
magnetic field increases. This, however, does not come without a price. The
magnetic field contains potential_energy, and increasing the field strength
requires more energy to be stored in the field. This energy comes from the
electric current through the inductor. The increase in the magnetic potential
energy of the field is provided by a corresponding drop in the electric
potential energy of the charges flowing through the windings. This appears as a
voltage drop across the windings as long as the current increases. Once the
current is no longer increased and is held constant, the energy in the magnetic
field is constant and no additional energy must be supplied, so the voltage
drop across the windings disappears.
Similarly, if the current through the inductor decreases, the magnetic field
strength decreases, and the energy in the magnetic field decreases. This energy
is returned to the circuit in the form of an increase in the electrical
potential energy of the moving charges, causing a voltage rise across the
windings.
*** Derivation[edit] ***
The work done per unit charge on the charges passing the inductor is
&#x2212;   E     {\displaystyle -{\mathcal {E}}}  [{\displaystyle -{\mathcal
{E}}}]. The negative sign indicates that the work is done against the emf, and
is not done by the emf. The current     I   {\displaystyle I}  [I] is the
charge per unit time passing through the inductor. Therefore the rate of work
W   {\displaystyle W}  [W] done by the charges against the emf, that is the
rate of change of energy of the current, is given by
            d W   d t    = &#x2212;   E   I   {\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=-
      {\mathcal {E}}I}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=-{\mathcal {E}}I}]
From the constitutive equation for the inductor,     &#x2212;   E   = L    d I
d t      {\displaystyle -{\mathcal {E}}=L{\frac {dI}{dt}}}  [{\displaystyle -
{\mathcal {E}}=L{\frac {dI}{dt}}}] so
            d W   d t    = L    d I   d t    &#x22C5; I = L I &#x22C5;    d I
      d t      {\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=L{\frac {dI}{dt}}\cdot I=LI\cdot
      {\frac {dI}{dt}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=L{\frac {dI}
      {dt}}\cdot I=LI\cdot {\frac {dI}{dt}}}]
         d W = L I &#x22C5; d I   {\displaystyle dW=LI\cdot dI}  [
      {\displaystyle dW=LI\cdot dI}]
In a ferromagnetic core inductor, when the magnetic field approaches the level
at which the core saturates, the inductance will begin to change, it will be a
function of the current     L ( I )   {\displaystyle L(I)}  [{\displaystyle L
(I)}]. Neglecting losses, the energy     W   {\displaystyle W}  [W] stored by
an inductor with a current      I  0     {\displaystyle I_{0}}  [I_{0}] passing
through it is equal to the amount of work required to establish the current
through the inductor. This is given by:
         W =  &#x222B;  0    I  0     L ( I ) I d I   {\displaystyle W=\int _
      {0}^{I_{0}}L(I)IdI}  [{\displaystyle W=\int _{0}^{I_{0}}L(I)IdI}].
In an air core inductor or a ferromagnetic core inductor below saturation, the
inductance is constant, so the stored energy is
             W    = L  &#x222B;  0    I  0     I d I     W    =   1 2   L  I  0
      2         {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}W&=L\int _{0}^{I_{0}}IdI\\W&=
      {\frac {1}{2}}LI_{0}^{2}\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}W&=L\int _{0}^{I_{0}}IdI\\W&={\frac {1}{2}}LI_{0}^{2}\end
      {aligned}}}]
For inductors with magnetic cores, the above equation is only valid for linear
regions of the magnetic flux, at currents below the saturation level of the
inductor, where the inductance is approximately constant. Where this is not the
case, the integral form must be used with      L  I     {\displaystyle L_{I}}
[{\displaystyle L_{I}}] variable.
**** Ideal and real inductors[edit] ****
The constitutive_equation describes the behavior of an ideal inductor with
inductance     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L], and without resistance, capacitance,
or energy dissipation. In practice, inductors do not follow this theoretical
model; real inductors have a measurable resistance due to the resistance of the
wire and energy losses in the core, and parasitic_capacitance due to electric
potentials between turns of the wire.[10][11]
A real inductor's capacitive_reactance rises with frequency, and at a certain
frequency, the inductor will behave as a resonant_circuit. Above this self-
resonant_frequency, the capacitive reactance is the dominant part of the
inductor's impedance. At higher frequencies, resistive losses in the windings
increase due to the skin_effect and proximity_effect.
Inductors with ferromagnetic cores experience additional energy losses due to
hysteresis and eddy_currents in the core, which increase with frequency. At
high currents, magnetic core inductors also show sudden departure from ideal
behavior due to nonlinearity caused by magnetic_saturation of the core.
Inductors radiate electromagnetic energy into surrounding space and may absorb
electromagnetic emissions from other circuits, resulting in potential
electromagnetic_interference.
An early solid-state electrical switching and amplifying device called a
saturable_reactor exploits saturation of the core as a means of stopping the
inductive transfer of current via the core.
*** Q factor[edit] ***
The winding resistance appears as a resistance in series with the inductor; it
is referred to as DCR (DC resistance). This resistance dissipates some of the
reactive energy. The quality_factor (or Q) of an inductor is the ratio of its
inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and is a measure of
its efficiency. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it
approaches the behavior of an ideal inductor. High Q inductors are used with
capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and receivers. The
higher the Q is, the narrower the bandwidth of the resonant circuit.
The Q factor of an inductor is defined as, where L is the inductance, R is the
DCR, and the product ÏL is the inductive reactance:
         Q =    &#x03C9; L  R     {\displaystyle Q={\frac {\omega L}{R}}}  [Q=
      {\frac  {\omega L}{R}}]

Q increases linearly with frequency if L and R are constant. Although they are
constant at low frequencies, the parameters vary with frequency. For example,
skin effect, proximity_effect, and core losses increase R with frequency;
winding capacitance and variations in permeability with frequency affect L.
At low frequencies and within limits, increasing the number of turns N improves
Q because L varies as N2 while R varies linearly with N. Similarly increasing
the radius r of an inductor improves (or increases) Q because L varies as r2
while R varies linearly with r. So high Q air core inductors often have large
diameters and many turns. Both of those examples assume the diameter of the
wire stays the same, so both examples use proportionally more wire. If the
total mass of wire is held constant, then there would be no advantage to
increasing the number of turns or the radius of the turns because the wire
would have to be proportionally thinner.
Using a high permeability ferromagnetic core can greatly increase the
inductance for the same amount of copper, so the core can also increase the Q.
Cores however also introduce losses that increase with frequency. The core
material is chosen for best results for the frequency band. High Q inductors
must avoid saturation; one way is by using a (physically larger) air core
inductor. At VHF or higher frequencies an air core is likely to be used. A well
designed air core inductor may have a Q of several hundred.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Example of signal filtering. In this configuration, the inductor blocks AC
current, while allowing DC current to pass.
Example of signal filtering. In this configuration, the inductor decouples DC
current, while allowing AC current to pass.
Inductors are used extensively in analog_circuits and signal processing.
Applications range from the use of large inductors in power supplies, which in
conjunction with filter capacitors remove ripple which is a multiple of the
mains frequency (or the switching frequency for switched-mode power supplies)
from the direct current output, to the small inductance of the ferrite_bead or
torus installed around a cable to prevent radio_frequency_interference from
being transmitted down the wire. Inductors are used as the energy storage
device in many switched-mode_power_supplies to produce DC current. The inductor
supplies energy to the circuit to keep current flowing during the "off"
switching periods and enables topographies where the output voltage is higher
than the input voltage.
A tuned_circuit, consisting of an inductor connected to a capacitor, acts as a
resonator for oscillating current. Tuned circuits are widely used in radio
frequency equipment such as radio transmitters and receivers, as narrow
bandpass_filters to select a single frequency from a composite signal, and in
electronic_oscillators to generate sinusoidal signals.
Two (or more) inductors in proximity that have coupled magnetic flux (mutual
inductance) form a transformer, which is a fundamental component of every
electric utility power grid. The efficiency of a transformer may decrease as
the frequency increases due to eddy currents in the core material and skin
effect on the windings. The size of the core can be decreased at higher
frequencies. For this reason, aircraft use 400 hertz alternating current rather
than the usual 50 or 60 hertz, allowing a great saving in weight from the use
of smaller transformers.[12] Transformers enable switched-mode power supplies
that isolate the output from the input.
Inductors are also employed in electrical transmission systems, where they are
used to limit switching currents and fault_currents. In this field, they are
more commonly referred to as reactors.
Inductors have parasitic effects which cause them to depart from ideal
behavior. They create and suffer from electromagnetic_interference (EMI). Their
physical size prevents them from being integrated on semiconductor chips. So
the use of inductors is declining in modern electronic devices, particularly
compact portable devices. Real inductors are increasingly being replaced by
active circuits such as the gyrator which can synthesize_inductance using
capacitors.

An inductor usually consists of a coil of conducting material, typically
insulated copper_wire, wrapped around a core either of plastic (to create an
air-core inductor) or of a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) material; the
latter is called an "iron core" inductor. The high permeability of the
ferromagnetic core increases the magnetic field and confines it closely to the
inductor, thereby increasing the inductance. Low frequency inductors are
constructed like transformers, with cores of electrical_steel laminated to
prevent eddy_currents. 'Soft' ferrites are widely used for cores above audio
frequencies, since they do not cause the large energy losses at high
frequencies that ordinary iron alloys do. Inductors come in many shapes. Some
inductors have an adjustable core, which enables changing of the inductance.
Inductors used to block very high frequencies are sometimes made by stringing a
ferrite bead on a wire.
Small inductors can be etched directly onto a printed_circuit_board by laying
out the trace in a spiral pattern. Some such planar inductors use a planar
core. Small value inductors can also be built on integrated_circuits using the
same processes that are used to make interconnects. Aluminium_interconnect is
typically used, laid out in a spiral coil pattern. However, the small
dimensions limit the inductance, and it is far more common to use a circuit
called a gyrator that uses a capacitor and active components to behave
similarly to an inductor. Regardless of the design, because of the low
inductances and low power dissipation on-die inductors allow, they're currently
only commercially used for high frequency RF circuits.
**** Shielded inductors[edit] ****
Inductors used in power regulation systems, lighting, and other systems that
require low-noise operating conditions, are often partially or fully shielded.
[13][14] In telecommunication circuits employing induction coils and repeating
transformers shielding of inductors in close proximity reduces circuit cross-
talk.
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Air-core inductor[edit] ****
An antenna_tuning coil at an AM radio station. It illustrates high power high_Q
construction: single layer winding with turns spaced apart to reduce proximity
effect losses, made of silver-plated tubing to reduce skin_effect losses,
supported by narrow insulating strips to reduce dielectric_losses.
The term air core coil describes an inductor that does not use a magnetic_core
made of a ferromagnetic material. The term refers to coils wound on plastic,
ceramic, or other nonmagnetic forms, as well as those that have only air inside
the windings. Air core coils have lower inductance than ferromagnetic core
coils, but are often used at high frequencies because they are free from energy
losses called core_losses that occur in ferromagnetic cores, which increase
with frequency. A side effect that can occur in air core coils in which the
winding is not rigidly supported on a form is 'microphony': mechanical
vibration of the windings can cause variations in the inductance.
*** Radio-frequency inductor[edit] ***
Collection of RF inductors, showing techniques to reduce losses. The three top
left and the ferrite_loopstick or rod antenna,[15][16][17][18] bottom, have
basket windings.
At high_frequencies, particularly radio_frequencies (RF), inductors have higher
resistance and other losses. In addition to causing power loss, in resonant
circuits this can reduce the Q_factor of the circuit, broadening the bandwidth.
In RF inductors, which are mostly air core types, specialized construction
techniques are used to minimize these losses. The losses are due to these
effects:
  Skin effect
      The resistance of a wire to high_frequency current is higher than its
      resistance to direct_current because of skin_effect. Radio frequency
      alternating current does not penetrate far into the body of a conductor
      but travels along its surface. For example, at 6 MHz the skin depth of
      copper wire is about 0.001 inches (25 Âµm); most of the current is within
      this depth of the surface. Therefore, in a solid wire, the interior
      portion of the wire may carry little current, effectively increasing its
      resistance.
  Proximity effect
      Another similar effect that also increases the resistance of the wire at
      high frequencies is proximity effect, which occurs in parallel wires that
      lie close to each other. The individual magnetic field of adjacent turns
      induces eddy_currents in the wire of the coil, which causes the current
      in the conductor to be concentrated in a thin strip on the side near the
      adjacent wire. Like skin effect, this reduces the effective cross-
      sectional area of the wire conducting current, increasing its resistance.
  Dielectric losses
      The high frequency electric field near the conductors in a tank coil can
      cause the motion of polar molecules in nearby insulating materials,
      dissipating energy as heat. So coils used for tuned circuits are often
      not wound on coil forms but are suspended in air, supported by narrow
      plastic or ceramic strips.
  Parasitic capacitance
      The capacitance between individual wire turns of the coil, called
      parasitic_capacitance, does not cause energy losses but can change the
      behavior of the coil. Each turn of the coil is at a slightly different
      potential, so the electric_field between neighboring turns stores charge
      on the wire, so the coil acts as if it has a capacitor in parallel with
      it. At a high enough frequency this capacitance can resonate with the
      inductance of the coil forming a tuned_circuit, causing the coil to
      become self-resonant.
High Q tank coil in a shortwave transmitter
(left) Spiderweb coil (right) Adjustable ferrite slug-tuned RF coil with
basketweave winding and litz wire
To reduce parasitic capacitance and proximity effect, high_Q RF coils are
constructed to avoid having many turns lying close together, parallel to one
another. The windings of RF coils are often limited to a single layer, and the
turns are spaced apart. To reduce resistance due to skin effect, in high-power
inductors such as those used in transmitters the windings are sometimes made of
a metal strip or tubing which has a larger surface area, and the surface is
silver-plated.
  Basket-weave coils
      To reduce proximity effect and parasitic capacitance, multilayer RF coils
      are wound in patterns in which successive turns are not parallel but
      criss-crossed at an angle; these are often called honeycomb or basket-
      weave coils. These are occasionally wound on a vertical insulating
      supports with dowels or slots, with the wire weaving in and out through
      the slots.
  Spiderweb coils
      Another construction technique with similar advantages is flat spiral
      coils.These are often wound on a flat insulating support with radial
      spokes or slots, with the wire weaving in and out through the slots;
      these are called spiderweb coils. The form has an odd number of slots, so
      successive turns of the spiral lie on opposite sides of the form,
      increasing separation.
  Litz wire
      To reduce skin effect losses, some coils are wound with a special type of
      radio frequency wire called litz_wire. Instead of a single solid
      conductor, litz wire consists of a number of smaller wire strands that
      carry the current. Unlike ordinary stranded_wire, the strands are
      insulated from each other, to prevent skin effect from forcing the
      current to the surface, and are twisted or braided together. The twist
      pattern ensures that each wire strand spends the same amount of its
      length on the outside of the wire bundle, so skin effect distributes the
      current equally between the strands, resulting in a larger cross-
      sectional conduction area than an equivalent single wire.
  Axial Inductor
Small inductors for low current and low power are made in molded cases
resembling resistors. These may be either plain (phenolic) core or ferrite
core. An ohmmeter readily distinguishes them from similar-sized resistors by
showing the low resistance of the inductor.
**** Ferromagnetic-core inductor[edit] ****
See also: Magnetic_core
A variety of types of ferrite core inductors and transformers
Ferromagnetic-core or iron-core inductors use a magnetic core made of a
ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron or ferrite to increase the
inductance. A magnetic core can increase the inductance of a coil by a factor
of several thousand, by increasing the magnetic field due to its higher
magnetic_permeability. However the magnetic properties of the core material
cause several side effects which alter the behavior of the inductor and require
special construction:
  Core_losses
      A time-varying current in a ferromagnetic inductor, which causes a time-
      varying magnetic field in its core, causes energy losses in the core
      material that are dissipated as heat, due to two processes:
        Eddy_currents
            From Faraday's_law_of_induction, the changing magnetic field can
            induce circulating loops of electric current in the conductive
            metal core. The energy in these currents is dissipated as heat in
            the resistance of the core material. The amount of energy lost
            increases with the area inside the loop of current.
        Hysteresis
            Changing or reversing the magnetic field in the core also causes
            losses due to the motion of the tiny magnetic_domains it is
            composed of. The energy loss is proportional to the area of the
            hysteresis loop in the BH graph of the core material. Materials
            with low coercivity have narrow hysteresis loops and so low
            hysteresis losses.
      Core loss is non-linear with respect to both frequency of magnetic
      fluctuation and magnetic flux density. Frequency of magnetic fluctuation
      is the frequency of AC current in the electric circuit; magnetic flux
      density corresponds to current in the electric circuit. Magnetic
      fluctuation gives rise to hysteresis, and magnetic flux density causes
      eddy currents in the core. These nonlinearities are distinguished from
      the threshold nonlinearity of saturation. Core loss can be approximately
      modeled with Steinmetz's_equation. At low frequencies and over limited
      frequency spans (maybe a factor of 10), core loss may be treated as a
      linear function of frequency with minimal error. However, even in the
      audio range, nonlinear effects of magnetic core inductors are noticeable
      and of concern.
  Saturation
      If the current through a magnetic core coil is high enough that the core
      saturates, the inductance will fall and current will rise dramatically.
      This is a nonlinear threshold phenomenon and results in distortion of the
      signal. For example, audio_signals can suffer intermodulation_distortion
      in saturated inductors. To prevent this, in linear_circuits the current
      through iron core inductors must be limited below the saturation level.
      Some laminated cores have a narrow air gap in them for this purpose, and
      powdered iron cores have a distributed air gap. This allows higher levels
      of magnetic flux and thus higher currents through the inductor before it
      saturates.[19]
  Curie point demagnetization
      If the temperature of a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic core rises to a
      specified level, the magnetic domains dissociate, and the material
      becomes paramagnetic, no longer able to support magnetic flux. The
      inductance falls and current rises dramatically, similarly to what
      happens during saturation. The effect is reversible: When the temperature
      falls below the Curie point, magnetic flux resulting from current in the
      electric circuit will realign the magnetic domains of the core and its
      magnetic flux will be restored. The Curie point of ferromagnetic
      materials (iron alloys) is quite high; iron is highest at 770 Â°C.
      However, for some ferrimagnetic materials (ceramic iron compounds â
      ferrites) the Curie point can be close to ambient temperatures (below
      100 Â°C).[citation_needed]
*** Laminated-core inductor[edit] ***
Laminated iron core ballast inductor for a metal_halide_lamp
Low-frequency inductors are often made with laminated_cores to prevent eddy
currents, using construction similar to transformers. The core is made of
stacks of thin steel sheets or laminations oriented parallel to the field, with
an insulating coating on the surface. The insulation prevents eddy currents
between the sheets, so any remaining currents must be within the cross
sectional area of the individual laminations, reducing the area of the loop and
thus reducing the energy losses greatly. The laminations are made of low-
conductivity silicon_steel to further reduce eddy current losses.
*** Ferrite-core inductor[edit] ***
Main article: Ferrite_core
For higher frequencies, inductors are made with cores of ferrite. Ferrite is a
ceramic ferrimagnetic material that is nonconductive, so eddy currents cannot
flow within it. The formulation of ferrite is xxFe2O4 where xx represents
various metals. For inductor cores soft_ferrites are used, which have low
coercivity and thus low hysteresis losses.

*** Toroidal-core inductor[edit] ***
Main article: Toroidal_inductors_and_transformers
Toroidal inductor in the power supply of a wireless router
In an inductor wound on a straight rod-shaped core, the magnetic_field_lines
emerging from one end of the core must pass through the air to re-enter the
core at the other end. This reduces the field, because much of the magnetic
field path is in air rather than the higher permeability core material and is a
source of electromagnetic_interference. A higher magnetic field and inductance
can be achieved by forming the core in a closed magnetic_circuit. The magnetic
field lines form closed loops within the core without leaving the core
material. The shape often used is a toroidal or doughnut-shaped ferrite core.
Because of their symmetry, toroidal cores allow a minimum of the magnetic flux
to escape outside the core (called leakage_flux), so they radiate less
electromagnetic interference than other shapes. Toroidal core coils are
manufactured of various materials, primarily ferrite, powdered iron and
laminated cores.[20]
**** Variable inductor[edit] ****
(left) Inductor with a threaded ferrite slug (visible at top) that can be
turned to move it into or out of the coil. 4.2 cm high. (right) A variometer
used in radio receivers in the 1920s
A "roller coil", an adjustable air-core RF inductor used in the tuned_circuits
of radio transmitters. One of the contacts to the coil is made by the small
grooved wheel, which rides on the wire. Turning the shaft rotates the coil,
moving the contact wheel up or down the coil, allowing more or fewer turns of
the coil into the circuit, to change the inductance.
Probably the most common type of variable inductor today is one with a moveable
ferrite magnetic core, which can be slid or screwed in or out of the coil.
Moving the core farther into the coil increases the permeability, increasing
the magnetic field and the inductance. Many inductors used in radio
applications (usually less than 100 MHz) use adjustable cores in order to tune
such inductors to their desired value, since manufacturing processes have
certain tolerances (inaccuracy). Sometimes such cores for frequencies above
100 MHz are made from highly conductive non-magnetic material such as aluminum.
[21] They decrease the inductance because the magnetic field must bypass them.
Air core inductors can use sliding contacts or multiple taps to increase or
decrease the number of turns included in the circuit, to change the inductance.
A type much used in the past but mostly obsolete today has a spring contact
that can slide along the bare surface of the windings. The disadvantage of this
type is that the contact usually short-circuits one or more turns. These turns
act like a single-turn short-circuited transformer secondary_winding; the large
currents induced in them cause power losses.
A type of continuously variable air core inductor is the variometer. This
consists of two coils with the same number of turns connected in series, one
inside the other. The inner coil is mounted on a shaft so its axis can be
turned with respect to the outer coil. When the two coils' axes are collinear,
with the magnetic fields pointing in the same direction, the fields add and the
inductance is maximum. When the inner coil is turned so its axis is at an angle
with the outer, the mutual inductance between them is smaller so the total
inductance is less. When the inner coil is turned 180Â° so the coils are
collinear with their magnetic fields opposing, the two fields cancel each other
and the inductance is very small. This type has the advantage that it is
continuously variable over a wide range. It is used in antenna_tuners and
matching circuits to match low frequency transmitters to their antennas.
Another method to control the inductance without any moving parts requires an
additional DC current bias winding which controls the permeability of an easily
saturable core material. See Magnetic_amplifier.
**** Choke[edit] ****
An MF or HF radio choke for tenths of an ampere, and a ferrite bead VHF choke
for several amperes.
A choke is an inductor designed specifically for blocking high-frequency
alternating current (AC) in an electrical circuit, while allowing DC or low-
frequency signals to pass. It usually consists of a coil of insulated wire
wound on a magnetic core, although some consist of a donut-shaped "bead" of
ferrite material strung on a wire. Like other inductors, chokes resist changes
in current passing through them increasingly with frequency. The difference
between chokes and other inductors is that chokes do not require the high Q
factor construction techniques that are used to reduce the resistance in
inductors used in tuned circuits.
***** Circuit analysis[edit] *****
The effect of an inductor in a circuit is to oppose changes in current through
it by developing a voltage across it proportional to the rate of change of the
current. An ideal inductor would offer no resistance to a constant direct
current; however, only superconducting inductors have truly zero electrical
resistance.
The relationship between the time-varying voltage v(t) across an inductor with
inductance L and the time-varying current i(t) passing through it is described
by the differential_equation:
         v ( t ) = L    d i ( t )   d t      {\displaystyle v(t)=L{\frac {di
      (t)}{dt}}}  [v(t)=L{\frac  {di(t)}{dt}}]
When there is a sinusoidal alternating_current (AC) through an inductor, a
sinusoidal voltage is induced. The amplitude of the voltage is proportional to
the product of the amplitude (IP) of the current and the frequency (f) of the
current.
             i ( t )    =  I   P    sin &#x2061; ( &#x03C9; t )        d i ( t
      )   d t       =  I   P    &#x03C9; cos &#x2061; ( &#x03C9; t )     v ( t
      )    = L  I   P    &#x03C9; cos &#x2061; ( &#x03C9; t )
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}i(t)&=I_{\mathrm {P} }\sin(\omega t)\\
      {\frac {di(t)}{dt}}&=I_{\mathrm {P} }\omega \cos(\omega t)\\v(t)&=LI_
      {\mathrm {P} }\omega \cos(\omega t)\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle
      {\begin{aligned}i(t)&=I_{\mathrm {P} }\sin(\omega t)\\{\frac {di(t)}
      {dt}}&=I_{\mathrm {P} }\omega \cos(\omega t)\\v(t)&=LI_{\mathrm {P}
      }\omega \cos(\omega t)\end{aligned}}}]
In this situation, the phase of the current lags that of the voltage by Ï/2
(90Â°). For sinusoids, as the voltage across the inductor goes to its maximum
value, the current goes to zero, and as the voltage across the inductor goes to
zero, the current through it goes to its maximum value.
If an inductor is connected to a direct current source with value I via a
resistance R (at least the DCR of the inductor), and then the current source is
short-circuited, the differential relationship above shows that the current
through the inductor will discharge with an exponential_decay:
         i ( t ) = I  e  &#x2212;   R L   t     {\displaystyle i(t)=Ie^{-{\frac
      {R}{L}}t}}  [i(t)=Ie^{{-{\frac  {R}{L}}t}}]
**** Reactance[edit] ****
The ratio of the peak voltage to the peak current in an inductor energised from
an AC source is called the reactance and is denoted XL.
          X   L    =    V   P     I   P      =    &#x03C9; L  I   P      I   P
      {\displaystyle X_{\mathrm {L} }={\frac {V_{\mathrm {P} }}{I_{\mathrm {P}
      }}}={\frac {\omega LI_{\mathrm {P} }}{I_{\mathrm {P} }}}}  [
      {\displaystyle X_{\mathrm {L} }={\frac {V_{\mathrm {P} }}{I_{\mathrm {P}
      }}}={\frac {\omega LI_{\mathrm {P} }}{I_{\mathrm {P} }}}}]
Thus,
          X   L    = &#x03C9; L   {\displaystyle X_{\mathrm {L} }=\omega L}  [
      {\displaystyle X_{\mathrm {L} }=\omega L}]
Reactance is measured in ohms but referred to as impedance rather than
resistance; energy is stored in the magnetic field as current rises and
discharged as current falls. Inductive reactance is proportional to frequency.
At low frequency the reactance falls; at DC, the inductor behaves as a short-
circuit. As frequency increases the reactance increases and at a sufficiently
high frequency the reactance approaches that of an open circuit.
**** Corner frequency[edit] ****
In filtering applications,with respect to a particular load impedance, an
inductor has a corner_frequency defined as:
          f   3  d B    =   R  2 &#x03C0; L      {\displaystyle f_{\mathrm
      {3\,dB} }={\frac {R}{2\pi L}}}  [{\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {3\,dB} }=
      {\frac {R}{2\pi L}}}]
**** Laplace circuit analysis (s-domain)[edit] ****
When using the Laplace_transform in circuit analysis, the impedance of an ideal
inductor with no initial current is represented in the s domain by:
         Z ( s ) = L s    {\displaystyle Z(s)=Ls\,}  [Z(s)=Ls\,]
where
         L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] is the inductance, and
         s   {\displaystyle s}  [s] is the complex frequency.
If the inductor does have initial current, it can be represented by:
    * adding a voltage source in series with the inductor, having the value:
               L  I  0      {\displaystyle LI_{0}\,}  [LI_{0}\,]
      where
               L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] is the inductance, and
                I  0     {\displaystyle I_{0}}  [I_{0}] is the initial current
            in the inductor.
      (Note that the source should have a polarity that is aligned with the
      initial current)
    * or by adding a current source in parallel with the inductor, having the
      value:
                  I  0   s     {\displaystyle {\frac {I_{0}}{s}}}  [{\frac  {I_
            {0}}{s}}]
      where
                I  0     {\displaystyle I_{0}}  [I_{0}] is the initial current
            in the inductor.
               s   {\displaystyle s}  [s] is the complex frequency.
**** Inductor networks[edit] ****
Main article: Series_and_parallel_circuits
Inductors in a parallel configuration each have the same potential difference
(voltage). To find their total equivalent inductance (Leq):
      [A_diagram_of_several_inductors,_side_by_side,_both_leads_of_each
      connected_to_the_same_wires]
           1  L   e q      =   1  L  1     +   1  L  2     + &#x22EF; +   1  L
      n       {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{L_{\mathrm {eq} }}}={\frac {1}{L_{1}}}+
      {\frac {1}{L_{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{L_{n}}}}  [{\frac  {1}{L_{{\mathrm
      {eq}}}}}={\frac  {1}{L_{1}}}+{\frac  {1}{L_{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac  {1}{L_
      {n}}}]
The current through inductors in series stays the same, but the voltage across
each inductor can be different. The sum of the potential differences (voltage)
is equal to the total voltage. To find their total inductance:
      [A_diagram_of_several_inductors,_connected_end_to_end,_with_the_same
      amount_of_current_going_through_each]
          L   e q    =  L  1   +  L  2   + &#x22EF; +  L  n
      {\displaystyle L_{\mathrm {eq} }=L_{1}+L_{2}+\cdots +L_{n}\,\!}  [L_{
      {\mathrm  {eq}}}=L_{1}+L_{2}+\cdots +L_{n}\,\!]
These simple relationships hold true only when there is no mutual coupling of
magnetic fields between individual inductors.
*** Mutual inductance[edit] ***
Mutual inductance occurs when the magnetic field of an inductor induces a
magnetic field in an adjacent inductor. Mutual induction is the basis of
transformer construction. M=(L1ÃL2)^(1/2) where M is the maximum mutual
inductance possible between 2 inductors and L1 and L2 are the two inductors. In
general M<=(L1ÃL2)^(1/2) as only a fraction of self flux is linked with the
other. This fraction is called "Coefficient of flux linkage" or "Coefficient of
coupling". K=MÃ·((L1ÃL2)^0.5)

   1. ^ Nagaokaâs coefficient (K) is approximately 1 for a coil which is much
      longer than its diameter and is tightly wound using small gauge wire (so
      that it approximates a current sheet).
