In physics, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with
respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of all forces
acting on the object, as described by Newton's_Second_Law.[1] The SI unit for
acceleration is metre_per_second_squared (mâsâ2). Accelerations are vector
quantities (they have magnitude and direction) and add according to the
parallelogram_law.[2][3] The vector of the net force acting on a body has the
same direction as the vector of the body's acceleration, and its magnitude is
proportional to the magnitude of the acceleration, with the object's mass (a
scalar quantity) as proportionality constant.
For example, when a car starts from a standstill (zero velocity, in an inertial
frame of reference) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is
accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car turns, an acceleration
occurs toward the new direction. The forward acceleration of the car is called
a linear (or tangential) acceleration, the reaction to which passengers in the
car experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. When changing
direction, this is called radial (as orthogonal to tangential) acceleration,
the reaction to which passengers experience as a sideways force. If the speed
of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction of the
velocity of the vehicle, sometimes called deceleration or Retrograde burning in
spacecraft.[4] Passengers experience the reaction to deceleration as a force
pushing them forwards. Both acceleration and deceleration are treated the same,
they are both changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (tangential,
radial, deceleration) is felt by passengers until their velocity (speed and
direction) matches that of the uniformly moving car.

***** Definition and properties[edit] *****
Kinematic quantities of a classical particle: mass m, position r, velocity v,
acceleration a.
**** Average acceleration[edit] ****
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. At any point on a trajectory,
the magnitude of the acceleration is given by the rate of change of velocity in
both magnitude and direction at that point. The true acceleration at time t is
found in the limit as time_interval Ît â 0 of Îv/Ît
An object's average acceleration over a period of time is its change in
velocity     ( &#x0394;  v  )   {\displaystyle (\Delta \mathbf {v} )}  [(\Delta
\mathbf {v} )] divided by the duration of the period     ( &#x0394; t )
{\displaystyle (\Delta t)}  [(\Delta t)]. Mathematically,
             a  &#x00AF;    =    &#x0394;  v    &#x0394; t    .
      {\displaystyle {\bar {\mathbf {a} }}={\frac {\Delta \mathbf {v} }{\Delta
      t}}.}  [{\displaystyle {\bar {\mathbf {a} }}={\frac {\Delta \mathbf {v} }
      {\Delta t}}.}]
**** Instantaneous acceleration[edit] ****
From bottom to top:
    * an acceleration function a(t);
    * the integral of the acceleration is the velocity function v(t);
    * and the integral of the velocity is the distance function s(t).
Instantaneous acceleration, meanwhile, is the limit of the average acceleration
over an infinitesimal interval of time. In the terms of calculus, instantaneous
acceleration is the derivative of the velocity vector with respect to time:
          a  =  lim   &#x0394; t  &#x2192; 0      &#x0394;  v    &#x0394; t
      =    d  v    d t      {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =\lim _{{\Delta t}\to 0}
      {\frac {\Delta \mathbf {v} }{\Delta t}}={\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}}
      [\mathbf {a} =\lim _{{\Delta t}\to 0}{\frac {\Delta \mathbf {v} }{\Delta
      t}}={\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}]
(Here and elsewhere, if motion_is_in_a_straight_line, vector quantities can be
substituted by scalars in the equations.)
It can be seen that the integral of the acceleration function a(t) is the
velocity function v(t); that is, the area under the curve of an acceleration
vs. time (a vs. t) graph corresponds to velocity.
          v  = &#x222B;  a  &#xA0; d t   {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\int
      \mathbf {a} \ dt}  [\mathbf {v} =\int \mathbf {a} \ dt]
As acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity, v, with respect to
time t and velocity is defined as the derivative of position, x, with respect
to time, acceleration can be thought of as the second_derivative of x with
respect to t:
          a  =    d  v    d t    =     d  2    x    d  t  2
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}={\frac {d^
      {2}\mathbf {x} }{dt^{2}}}}  [\mathbf {a} ={\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}=
      {\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {x} }{dt^{2}}}]
**** Units[edit] ****
Acceleration has the dimensions of velocity (L/T) divided by time, i.e. L
Tâ2. The SI unit of acceleration is the metre_per_second_squared (m sâ2);
or "metre per second per second", as the velocity in metres per second changes
by the acceleration value, every second.
**** Other forms[edit] ****
An object moving in a circular motion—such as a satellite orbiting the Earth—is
accelerating due to the change of direction of motion, although its speed may
be constant. In this case it is said to be undergoing centripetal (directed
towards the center) acceleration.
Proper_acceleration, the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall
condition, is measured by an instrument called an accelerometer.
In classical_mechanics, for a body with constant mass, the (vector)
acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net force
vector (i.e. sum of all forces) acting on it (Newton's_second_law):
          F  = m  a   &#x2192;   a  =    F  m     {\displaystyle \mathbf {F}
      =m\mathbf {a} \quad \to \quad \mathbf {a} ={\frac {\mathbf {F} }{m}}}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} \quad \to \quad \mathbf {a} =
      {\frac {\mathbf {F} }{m}}}]
where F is the net force acting on the body, m is the mass of the body, and a
is the center-of-mass acceleration. As speeds approach the speed_of_light,
relativistic_effects become increasingly large.
***** Tangential and centripetal acceleration[edit] *****
An oscillating pendulum, with velocity and acceleration marked. It experiences
both tangential and centripetal acceleration.
Components of acceleration for a curved motion. The tangential component atis
due to the change in speed of traversal, and points along the curve in the
direction of the velocity vector (or in the opposite direction). The normal
component (also called centripetal component for circular motion) ac is due to
the change in direction of the velocity vector and is normal to the trajectory,
pointing toward the center of curvature of the path.
See also: Local_coordinates
The velocity of a particle moving on a curved path as a function of time can be
written as:
          v  ( t ) = v ( t )     v  ( t )   v ( t )    = v ( t )   u    t
      ( t ) ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (t)=v(t){\frac {\mathbf {v} (t)}{v
      (t)}}=v(t)\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t} }(t),}  [\mathbf {v} (t)=v(t){\frac
      {\mathbf {v} (t)}{v(t)}}=v(t)\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t} }(t),]
with v(t) equal to the speed of travel along the path, and
           u    t    =     v  ( t )   v ( t )    &#xA0; ,   {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t} }={\frac {\mathbf {v} (t)}{v(t)}}\ ,}  [\mathbf
      {u} _{\mathrm {t} }={\frac {\mathbf {v} (t)}{v(t)}}\ ,]
a unit_vector_tangent to the path pointing in the direction of motion at the
chosen moment in time. Taking into account both the changing speed v(t) and the
changing direction of ut, the acceleration of a particle moving on a curved
path can be written using the chain_rule of differentiation[5] for the product
of two functions of time as:
              a     =     d   v     d  t          =     d  v    d  t      u
      t    + v ( t )    d   u    t      d t          =     d  v    d  t      u
      t    +    v  2   r     u    n    &#xA0; ,       {\displaystyle {\begin
      {alignedat}{3}\mathbf {a} &={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} }{\mathrm {d}
      t}}\\&={\frac {\mathrm {d} v}{\mathrm {d} t}}\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t}
      }+v(t){\frac {d\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t} }}{dt}}\\&={\frac {\mathrm {d}
      v}{\mathrm {d} t}}\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t} }+{\frac {v^{2}}{r}}\mathbf
      {u} _{\mathrm {n} }\ ,\\\end{alignedat}}}  [{\begin{alignedat}{3}\mathbf
      {a} &={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\\&={\frac
      {\mathrm {d} v}{\mathrm {d} t}}\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t} }+v(t){\frac
      {d\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t} }}{dt}}\\&={\frac {\mathrm {d} v}{\mathrm {d}
      t}}\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm {t} }+{\frac {v^{2}}{r}}\mathbf {u} _{\mathrm
      {n} }\ ,\\\end{alignedat}}]
where un is the unit (inward) normal_vector to the particle's trajectory (also
called the principal normal), and r is its instantaneous radius_of_curvature
based upon the osculating_circle at time t. These components are called the
tangential_acceleration and the normal or radial acceleration (or centripetal
acceleration in circular motion, see also circular_motion and centripetal
force).
Geometrical analysis of three-dimensional space curves, which explains tangent,
(principal) normal and binormal, is described by the FrenetâSerret_formulas.

***** Special cases[edit] *****
**** Uniform acceleration[edit] ****
Calculation of the speed difference for a uniform acceleration
Uniform or constant acceleration is a type of motion in which the velocity of
an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period.
A frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in free
fall in a uniform gravitational field. The acceleration of a falling body in
the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the gravitational
field strength g (also called acceleration due to gravity). By Newton's_Second
Law the force       F  g      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F_{g}} }  [{\displaystyle
\mathbf {F_{g}} }] acting on a body is given by:
           F  g    = m  g    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F_{g}} =m\mathbf {g} }  [
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F_{g}} =m\mathbf {g} }]
Because of the simple analytic properties of the case of constant acceleration,
there are simple formulas relating the displacement, initial and time-dependent
velocities, and acceleration to the time_elapsed:[8]
          s  ( t ) =   s   0   +   v   0   t +    1 2     a   t  2   =   s   0
      +      v   0   +  v  ( t )  2   t   {\displaystyle \mathbf {s}
      (t)=\mathbf {s} _{0}+\mathbf {v} _{0}t+{\tfrac {1}{2}}\mathbf {a} t^
      {2}=\mathbf {s} _{0}+{\frac {\mathbf {v} _{0}+\mathbf {v} (t)}{2}}t}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {s} (t)=\mathbf {s} _{0}+\mathbf {v} _{0}t+{\tfrac
      {1}{2}}\mathbf {a} t^{2}=\mathbf {s} _{0}+{\frac {\mathbf {v} _
      {0}+\mathbf {v} (t)}{2}}t}]
          v  ( t ) =   v   0   +  a  t   {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (t)=\mathbf
      {v} _{0}+\mathbf {a} t}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (t)=\mathbf {v} _
      {0}+\mathbf {a} t}]
           v  2    ( t ) =    v  0     2   + 2  a &#x22C5;  [  s  ( t )
      &#x2212;   s   0   ]   {\displaystyle {v^{2}}(t)={v_{0}}^{2}+2\mathbf
      {a\cdot } [\mathbf {s} (t)-\mathbf {s} _{0}]}  [{\displaystyle {v^{2}}
      (t)={v_{0}}^{2}+2\mathbf {a\cdot } [\mathbf {s} (t)-\mathbf {s} _{0}]}]
where
    *    t   {\displaystyle t}  [t] is the elapsed time,
    *      s   0     {\displaystyle \mathbf {s} _{0}}  [\mathbf {s} _{0}] is
      the initial displacement from the origin,
    *     s  ( t )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {s} (t)}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf
      {s} (t)}] is the displacement from the origin at time     t
      {\displaystyle t}  [t],
    *      v   0     {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}}  [\mathbf {v} _{0}] is
      the initial velocity,
    *     v  ( t )   {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (t)}  [\mathbf {v} (t)] is the
      velocity at time     t   {\displaystyle t}  [t], and
    *     a    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }  [\mathbf {a} ] is the uniform rate
      of acceleration.
In particular, the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts, one of
constant velocity and the other according to the above equations. As Galileo
showed, the net result is parabolic motion, which describes, e. g., the
trajectory of a projectile in a vacuum near the surface of Earth.[9]
**** Circular motion[edit] ****
Position vector r, always points radially from the origin.
Velocity vector v, always tangent to the path of motion.
Acceleration vector a, not parallel to the radial motion but offset by the
angular and Coriolis accelerations, nor tangent to the path but offset by the
centripetal and radial accelerations.
Kinematic vectors in plane polar coordinates. Notice the setup is not
restricted to 2d space, but may represent the osculating_plane plane in a point
of an arbitrary curve in any higher dimension.
In uniform circular_motion, that is moving with constant speed along a circular
path, a particle experiences an acceleration resulting from the change of the
direction of the velocity vector, while its magnitude remains constant. The
derivative of the location of a point on a curve with respect to time, i.e. its
velocity, turns out to be always exactly tangential to the curve, respectively
orthogonal to the radius in this point. Since in uniform motion the velocity in
the tangential direction does not change, the acceleration must be in radial
direction, pointing to the center of the circle. This acceleration constantly
changes the direction of the velocity to be tangent in the neighboring point,
thereby rotating the velocity vector along the circle.
â¢ For a given speed     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v], the magnitude of this
geometrically caused acceleration (centripetal acceleration) is inversely
proportional to the radius     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] of the circle, and
increases as the square of this speed:
          a  c   =    v  2   r    .   {\displaystyle a_{c}={\frac {v^{2}}
      {r}}\;.}  [{\displaystyle a_{c}={\frac {v^{2}}{r}}\;.}]
â¢ Note that, for a given angular velocity     &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle
\omega }  [\omega ], the centripetal acceleration is directly proportional to
radius     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r]. This is due to the dependence of
velocity     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] on the radius     r   {\displaystyle r}
[r].
         v = &#x03C9; r .   {\displaystyle v=\omega r.}  [{\displaystyle
      v=\omega r.}]
Expressing centripetal acceleration vector in polar components, where      r
{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }  [\mathbf {r} ] is a vector from the centre of the
circle to the particle with magnitude equal to this distance, and considering
the orientation of the acceleration towards the center, yields
           a  c    = &#x2212;    v  2     |   r   |     &#x22C5;    r    |   r
      |      .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {a_{c}} =-{\frac {v^{2}}{|\mathbf {r}
      |}}\cdot {\frac {\mathbf {r} }{|\mathbf {r} |}}\;.}  [{\displaystyle
      \mathbf {a_{c}} =-{\frac {v^{2}}{|\mathbf {r} |}}\cdot {\frac {\mathbf
      {r} }{|\mathbf {r} |}}\;.}]
As usual in rotations, the speed     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] of a particle
may be expressed as an angular_speed with respect to a point at the distance
r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] as
         &#x03C9; =   v r   .   {\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {v}{r}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {v}{r}}.}]
Thus       a  c    = &#x2212;  &#x03C9;  2    r   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf
{a_{c}} =-\omega ^{2}\mathbf {r} \;.}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {a_{c}} =-\omega
^{2}\mathbf {r} \;.}]
This acceleration and the mass of the particle determine the necessary
centripetal_force, directed toward the centre of the circle, as the net force
acting on this particle to keep it in this uniform circular motion. The so-
called 'centrifugal_force', appearing to act outward on the body, is a so-
called pseudo_force experienced in the frame_of_reference of the body in
circular motion, due to the body's linear_momentum, a vector tangent to the
circle of motion.
In a nonuniform circular motion, i.e., the speed along the curved path is
changing, the acceleration has a non-zero component tangential to the curve,
and is not confined to the principal_normal, which directs to the center of the
osculating circle, that determines the radius     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r]
for the centripetal acceleration. The tangential component is given by the
angular acceleration     &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ], i.e.,
the rate of change     &#x03B1; =    &#x03C9; &#x02D9;      {\displaystyle
\alpha ={\dot {\omega }}}  [{\displaystyle \alpha ={\dot {\omega }}}] of the
angular speed     &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle \omega }  [\omega ] times the
radius     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r]. That is,
          a  c   = r &#x03B1; .   {\displaystyle a_{c}=r\alpha .}  [
      {\displaystyle a_{c}=r\alpha .}]
The sign of the tangential component of the acceleration is determined by the
sign of the angular_acceleration (    &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }
[\alpha ]), and the tangent is of course always directed at right angles to the
radius vector.
***** Relation to relativity[edit] *****
**** Special relativity[edit] ****
Main articles: Special_relativity and Acceleration_(special_relativity)
The special theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects traveling
relative to other objects at speeds approaching that of light in a vacuum.
Newtonian_mechanics is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality,
valid to great accuracy at lower speeds. As the relevant speeds increase toward
the speed of light, acceleration no longer follows classical equations.
As speeds approach that of light, the acceleration produced by a given force
decreases, becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an
object with mass can approach this speed asymptotically, but never reach it.
**** General relativity[edit] ****
Main article: General_relativity
Unless the state of motion of an object is known, it is impossible to
distinguish whether an observed force is due to gravity or to
accelerationâgravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects. Albert
Einstein called this the equivalence_principle, and said that only observers
who feel no force at allâincluding the force of gravityâare justified in
concluding that they are not accelerating.[10]
