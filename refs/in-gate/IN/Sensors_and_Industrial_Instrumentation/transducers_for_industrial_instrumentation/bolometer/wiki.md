A bolometer is a device for measuring the power of incident electromagnetic
radiation via the heating of a material with a temperature-dependent electrical
resistance. It was invented in 1878 by the American astronomer Samuel_Pierpont
Langley.[1]

***** Principle of operation[edit] *****
[Conceptual_schematic_of_a_bolometer.]
Conceptual schematic of a bolometer. Power, P, from an incident signal is
absorbed and heats up a thermal mass with heat_capacity, C, and temperature, T.
The thermal mass is connected to a reservoir of constant temperature through a
link with thermal_conductance, G. The temperature increase is ÎT = P/G and is
measured with a resistive thermometer, allowing the determination of P. The
intrinsic thermal time constant is Ï = C/G.
A bolometer consists of an absorptive element, such as a thin layer of metal,
connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a
thermal link. The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive
element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir â the greater the
absorbed power, the higher the temperature. The intrinsic thermal time
constant, which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the
heat_capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal_conductance between the
absorptive element and the reservoir.[2] The temperature change can be measured
directly with an attached resistive thermometer, or the resistance of the
absorptive element itself can be used as a thermometer. Metal bolometers
usually work without cooling. They are produced from thin foils or metal films.
Today, most bolometers use semiconductor or superconductor absorptive elements
rather than metals. These devices can be operated at cryogenic temperatures,
enabling significantly greater sensitivity.
Bolometers are directly sensitive to the energy left inside the absorber. For
this reason they can be used not only for ionizing particles and photons, but
also for non-ionizing particles, any sort of radiation, and even to search for
unknown forms of mass or energy (like dark_matter); this lack of discrimination
can also be a shortcoming. The most sensitive bolometers are very slow to reset
(i.e., return to thermal equilibrium with the environment). On the other hand,
compared to more conventional particle detectors, they are extremely efficient
in energy resolution and in sensitivity. They are also known as thermal
detectors.
***** Langley's bolometer[edit] *****
The first bolometer used by Langley consisted of two platinum strips covered
with lampblack. One strip was shielded from radiation and one exposed to it.
The strips formed two branches of a Wheatstone_bridge which was fitted with a
sensitive galvanometer and connected to a battery. Electromagnetic radiation
falling on the exposed strip would heat it and change its resistance. By 1880,
Langley's bolometer was refined enough to detect thermal radiation from a cow a
quarter of a mile away.[3] This radiant-heat detector is sensitive to
differences in temperature of one hundred-thousandth of a degree Celsius
(0.00001 C).[4] This instrument enabled him to thermally detect across a broad
spectrum, noting all the chief Fraunhofer_lines. He also discovered new atomic
and molecular absorption lines in the invisible infrared portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Nikola_Tesla personally asked Dr. Langley if he could
use his bolometer for his power transmission experiments in 1892. Thanks to
that first use, he succeeded in making the first demonstration between West
Point and his laboratory on Houston Street.[5]
***** Applications in astronomy[edit] *****
While bolometers can be used to measure radiation of any frequency, for most
wavelength ranges there are other methods of detection that are more sensitive.
For sub-millimeter_wavelengths (from around 200 Âµm to 1 mm wavelength, also
known as the far-infrared or terahertz), bolometers are among the most
sensitive available detectors, and are therefore used for astronomy at these
wavelengths. To achieve the best sensitivity, they must be cooled to a fraction
of a degree above absolute_zero (typically from 50 mK to 300 mK). Notable
examples of bolometers employed in submillimeter astronomy include the Herschel
Space_Observatory, the James_Clerk_Maxwell_Telescope, and the Stratospheric
Observatory_for_Infrared_Astronomy (SOFIA).
***** Applications in particle physics[edit] *****
The term bolometer is also used in particle_physics to designate an
unconventional particle_detector. They use the same principle described above.
The bolometers are sensitive not only to light but to every form of energy. The
operating principle is similar to that of a calorimeter in thermodynamics.
However, the approximations, ultra_low_temperature, and the different purpose
of the device make the operational use rather different. In the jargon of high
energy physics, these devices are not called "calorimeters", since this term is
already used for a different type of detector (see Calorimeter). Their use as
particle detectors was proposed from the beginning of the 20th century, but the
first regular, though pioneering, use was only in the 1980s because of the
difficulty associated with cooling and operating a system at cryogenic
temperature. They can still be considered to be at the developmental stage.
***** Microbolometers[edit] *****
Main article: Microbolometer
A microbolometer is a specific type of bolometer used as a detector in a
thermal_camera. It is a grid of vanadium_oxide or amorphous_silicon heat
sensors atop a corresponding grid of silicon. Infrared radiation from a
specific range of wavelengths strikes the vanadium oxide or amorphous silicon,
and changes its electrical_resistance. This resistance change is measured and
processed into temperatures which can be represented graphically. The
microbolometer grid is commonly found in three sizes, a 640Ã480 array, a
320Ã240 array (384Ã288 amorphous silicon) or less expensive 160Ã120 array.
Different arrays provide the same resolution with larger array providing a
wider field_of_view.[citation_needed] Larger, 1024Ã768 arrays were announced
in 2008.
***** Hot electron bolometer[edit] *****
The hot electron bolometer (HEB) operates at cryogenic temperatures, typically
within a few degrees of absolute_zero. At these very low temperatures, the
electron system in a metal is weakly coupled to the phonon system. Power
coupled to the electron system drives it out of thermal equilibrium with the
phonon system, creating hot electrons.[6] Phonons in the metal are typically
well-coupled to substrate phonons and act as a thermal reservoir. In describing
the performance of the HEB, the relevant heat_capacity is the electronic heat
capacity and the relevant thermal_conductance is the electron-phonon thermal
conductance.
If the resistance of the absorbing element depends on the electron temperature,
then the resistance can be used as a thermometer of the electron system. This
is the case for both semiconducting and superconducting materials at low
temperature. If the absorbing element does not have a temperature-dependent
resistance, as is typical of normal (non-superconducting) metals at very low
temperature, then an attached resistive thermometer can be used to measure the
electron temperature.[2]
***** Microwave measurement[edit] *****
A bolometer can be used to measure power at microwave frequencies. In this
application, a resistive element is exposed to microwave power. A dc bias
current is applied to the resistor to raise its temperature via Joule_heating,
such that the resistance is matched to the waveguide characteristic impedance.
After applying microwave power, the bias current is reduced to return the
bolometer to its resistance in the absence of microwave power. The change in
the dc power is then equal to the absorbed microwave power. To reject the
effect of ambient temperature changes, the active (measuring) element is in a
bridge_circuit with an identical element not exposed to microwaves; variations
in temperature common to both elements do not affect the accuracy of the
reading. The average response time of the bolometer allows convenient
measurement of the power of a pulsed source.[7]

      but the first device that I used, and it was very successful, was an
      improvement on the bolometer. I met Professor Langley in 1892 at the
      Royal Institution. He said to me, after I had delivered a lecture, that
      they were all proud of me. I spoke to him of the bolometer, and remarked
      that it was a beautiful instrument. I then said, "Professor Langley, I
      have a suggestion for making an improvement in the bolometer, if you will
      embody it in the principle." I explained to him how the bolometer could
      be improved. Professor Langley was very much interested and wrote in his
      notebook what I suggested. I used what I have termed a small-mass
      resistance, but of much smaller mass than in the bolometer of Langley,
      and of much smaller mass than that of any of the devices which have been
      recorded in patents issued since. Those are clumsy things. I used masses
      that were not a millionth of the smallest mass described in any of the
      patents, or in the publications. With such an instrument, I operated, for
      instance, in West PointâI received signals from my laboratory on
      Houston Street in West Point.
