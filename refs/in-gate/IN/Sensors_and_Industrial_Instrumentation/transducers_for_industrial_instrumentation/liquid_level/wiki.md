A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its
container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As
such, it is one of the_four_fundamental_states_of_matter (the others being
solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no
fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as
atoms, held together by intermolecular_bonds. Like a gas, a liquid is able_to
flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression,
although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to
fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A
distinctive property of the liquid state is surface_tension, leading to wetting
phenomena. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth.
The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher
than in a gas. Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed_matter. On
the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both
called fluids. Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter
is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a
relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist. Most known matter in the
universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as
interstellar_clouds or in plasma from within stars.

***** Introduction *****
Thermal image of a sink full of hot water with cold water being added, showing
how the hot and the cold water flow into each other.
Liquid is one of the four_primary_states_of_matter, with the others being
solid, gas and plasma. A liquid is a fluid. Unlike a solid, the molecules in a
liquid have a much greater freedom to move. The forces that bind the molecules
together in a solid are only temporary in a liquid, allowing a liquid to flow
while a solid remains rigid.
A liquid, like a gas, displays the properties of a fluid. A liquid can flow,
assume the shape of a container, and, if placed in a sealed container, will
distribute applied pressure evenly to every surface in the container. If liquid
is placed in a bag, it can be squeezed into any shape. Unlike a gas, a liquid
is nearly incompressible, meaning that it occupies nearly a constant volume
over a wide range of pressures; it does not generally expand to fill available
space in a container but forms its own surface, and it may not always mix
readily with another liquid. These properties make a liquid suitable for
applications such as hydraulics.
Liquid particles are bound firmly but not rigidly. They are able to move around
one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the
temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes
distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling
point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and
the liquid changes to its gaseous state (unless superheating occurs). If the
temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller.
When the liquid reaches its freezing_point the molecules will usually lock into
a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become
more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling
occurs).
***** Examples *****
Only two elements are liquid at standard_conditions_for_temperature_and
pressure: mercury and bromine. Four more elements have melting points slightly
above room_temperature: francium, caesium, gallium and rubidium.[1] Metal
alloys that are liquid at room temperature include NaK, a sodium-potassium
metal alloy, galinstan, a fusible alloy liquid, and some amalgams (alloys
involving mercury).
Pure substances that are liquid under normal conditions include water, ethanol
and many other organic solvents. Liquid water is of vital importance in
chemistry and biology; it is believed to be a necessity for the existence of
life.
Inorganic liquids include water, magma, inorganic_nonaqueous_solvents and many
acids.
Important everyday liquids include aqueous solutions like household bleach,
other mixtures of different substances such as mineral_oil and gasoline,
emulsions like vinaigrette or mayonnaise, suspensions like blood, and colloids
like paint and milk.
Many gases can be liquefied by cooling, producing liquids such as liquid
oxygen, liquid_nitrogen, liquid_hydrogen and liquid_helium. Not all gases can
be liquified at atmospheric pressure, however. Carbon_dioxide, for example, can
only be liquified at pressures above 5.1 atm.[2]
Some materials cannot be classified within the classical three states of
matter; they possess solid-like and liquid-like properties. Examples include
liquid_crystals, used in LCD displays, and biological_membranes.
***** Applications *****
A lava lamp contains two immiscible liquids (a molten wax and a watery
solution) which add movement due to convection. In addition to the top surface,
surfaces also form between the liquids, requiring a tension breaker to
recombine the wax droplets at the bottom.
Liquids have a variety of uses, as lubricants, solvents, and coolants. In
hydraulic systems, liquid is used to transmit power.
In tribology, liquids are studied for their properties as lubricants.
Lubricants such as oil are chosen for viscosity and flow characteristics that
are suitable throughout the operating_temperature range of the component. Oils
are often used in engines, gear_boxes, metalworking, and hydraulic systems for
their good lubrication properties.[3]
Many liquids are used as solvents, to dissolve other liquids or solids.
Solutions are found in a wide variety of applications, including paints,
sealants, and adhesives. Naphtha and acetone are used frequently in industry to
clean oil, grease, and tar from parts and machinery. Body_fluids are water
based solutions.
Surfactants are commonly found in soaps and detergents. Solvents like alcohol
are often used as antimicrobials. They are found in cosmetics, inks, and liquid
dye_lasers. They are used in the food industry, in processes such as the
extraction of vegetable_oil.[4]
Liquids tend to have better thermal_conductivity than gases, and the ability to
flow makes a liquid suitable for removing excess heat from mechanical
components. The heat can be removed by channeling the liquid through a heat
exchanger, such as a radiator, or the heat can be removed with the liquid
during evaporation.[5] Water or glycol coolants are used to keep engines from
overheating.[6] The coolants used in nuclear_reactors include water or liquid
metals, such as sodium or bismuth.[7] Liquid_propellant films are used to cool
the thrust chambers of rockets.[8] In machining, water and oils are used to
remove the excess heat generated, which can quickly ruin both the work piece
and the tooling. During perspiration, sweat removes heat from the human body by
evaporating. In the heating,_ventilation,_and_air-conditioning industry (HVAC),
liquids such as water are used to transfer heat from one area to another.[9]
Similarly, liquids are often used in cooking for their better heat-transfer
properties. In addition to better conductivity, because warmer fluids expand
and rise while cooler areas contract and sink, liquids with low kinematic
viscosity tend to transfer heat through convection at a fairly constant
temperature, making a liquid suitable for blanching, boiling, or frying. This
phenomenon was also exploited to produce lava_lamps. Even higher rates of heat
transfer can be achieved by condensing a gas into a liquid. At the liquid's
boiling point, all of the heat energy is used to cause the phase change from a
liquid to a gas, without an accompanying increase in temperature, and is stored
as chemical potential_energy. When the gas condenses back into a liquid this
excess heat-energy is released at a constant temperature. This phenomenon is
used in processes such as steaming. Since liquids often have different boiling
points, mixtures or solutions of liquids or gases can typically be separated by
distillation, using heat, cold, vacuum, pressure, or other means. Distillation
can be found in everything from the production of alcoholic_beverages, to oil
refineries, to the cryogenic_distillation of gases such as argon, oxygen,
nitrogen, neon, or xenon by liquefaction (cooling them below their individual
boiling points).[10]
Liquid is the primary component of hydraulic systems, which take advantage of
Pascal's_law to provide fluid_power. Devices such as pumps and waterwheels have
been used to change liquid motion into mechanical_work since ancient times.
Oils are forced through hydraulic_pumps, which transmit this force to hydraulic
cylinders. Hydraulics can be found in many applications, such as automotive
brakes and transmissions, heavy_equipment, and airplane control systems.
Various hydraulic_presses are used extensively in repair and manufacturing, for
lifting, pressing, clamping and forming.[11]
Liquids are sometimes used in measuring devices. A thermometer often uses the
thermal_expansion of liquids, such as mercury, combined with their ability to
flow to indicate temperature. A manometer uses the weight of the liquid to
indicate air_pressure.[12]
***** Mechanical properties *****
**** Volume ****
Quantities of liquids are measured in units of volume. These include the SI
unit cubic metre (m3) and its divisions, in particular the cubic decimeter,
more commonly called the litre (1 dm3 = 1 L = 0.001 m3), and the cubic
centimetre, also called millilitre (1 cm3 = 1 mL = 0.001 L = 10â6 m3).[13]
The volume of a quantity of liquid is fixed by its temperature and pressure.
Liquids generally expand when heated, and contract when cooled. Water between
0 Â°C and 4 Â°C is a notable exception.[14]
On the other hand, liquids have little compressibility. Water, for example,
will compress by only 46.4 parts per million for every unit increase in
atmospheric_pressure (bar).[15] At around 4000 bar (400 megapascals or 58,000
psi) of pressure at room temperature water experiences only an 11% decrease in
volume.[16] Incompressibility makes liquids suitable for transmitting_hydraulic
power, because a change in pressure at one point in a liquid is transmitted
undiminished to every other part of the liquid and very little energy is lost
in the form of compression.[17]
However, the negligible compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The
banging of pipes, called water_hammer, occurs when a valve is suddenly closed,
creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the
system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's
incompressibility is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity they
can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or dramatic change in
direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a sharp corner in a
pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles,
which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to
fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding
any adjacent solid surface.[18]
**** Pressure and buoyancy ****
Main article: fluid_statics
In a gravitational_field, liquids exert pressure on the sides of a container as
well as on anything within the liquid itself. This pressure is transmitted in
all directions and increases with depth. If a liquid is at rest in a uniform
gravitational field, the pressure     p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] at depth     z
{\displaystyle z}  [z] is given by[19]
         p =  p  0   + &#x03C1; g z    {\displaystyle p=p_{0}+\rho gz\,}  [
      {\displaystyle p=p_{0}+\rho gz\,}]
where:
          p  0      {\displaystyle p_{0}\,}  [p_{0}\,] is the pressure at the
      surface
         &#x03C1;    {\displaystyle \rho \,}  [\rho \,] is the density of the
      liquid, assumed uniform with depth
         g    {\displaystyle g\,}  [g\,] is the gravitational_acceleration
For a body of water open to the air,      p  0     {\displaystyle p_{0}}  [p_
{0}] would be the atmospheric_pressure.
Static liquids in uniform gravitational fields also exhibit the phenomenon of
buoyancy, where objects immersed in the liquid experience a net force due to
the pressure variation with depth. The magnitude of the force is equal to the
weight of the liquid displaced by the object, and the direction of the force
depends on the average density of the immersed object. If the density is
smaller than that of the liquid, the buoyant force points upward and the object
floats, whereas if the density is larger, the buoyant force points downward and
the object sinks. This is known as Archimedes'_principle.[20]
**** Surfaces ****
Main articles: Surface_tension and Surface_science
Surface_waves in water
Unless the volume of a liquid exactly matches the volume of its container, one
or more surfaces are observed. The presence of a surface introduces new
phenomena which are not present in a bulk liquid. This is because a molecule at
a surface possesses bonds with other liquid molecules only on the inner side of
the surface, which implies a net force pulling surface molecules inward.
Equivalently, this force can be described in terms of energy: there is a fixed
amount of energy associated with forming a surface of a given area. This
quantity is a material property called the surface_tension, in units of energy
per unit area (SI units: J/m2). Liquids with strong intermolecular forces tend
to have large surface tensions.[21]
A practical implication of surface tension is that liquids tend to minimize
their surface area, forming spherical drops and bubbles unless other
constraints are present. Surface tension is responsible for a range of other
phenomena as well, including surface_waves, capillary_action, wetting, and
ripples. In liquids under nanoscale_confinement, surface effects can play a
dominating role since â compared with a macroscopic sample of liquid â a
much greater fraction of molecules are located near a surface.
The surface tension of a liquid directly affects its wettability. Most common
liquids have tensions ranging in the tens of mJ/m2, so droplets of oil, water,
or glue can easily merge and adhere to other surfaces, whereas liquid metals
such as mercury may have tensions ranging in the hundreds of mJ/m2, thus
droplets do not combine easily and surfaces may only wet under specific
conditions.
The surface tensions of common liquids occupy a relatively narrow range of
values, which contrasts strongly with the enormous variation seen in other
mechanical properties, such as viscosity.[22]
**** Flow ****
A simulation of viscosity. The fluid on the left has a lower viscosity and
Newtonian behavior while the liquid on the right has higher viscosity and non-
Newtonian behavior.
Main articles: Fluid_mechanics and Fluid_dynamics
An important physical property characterizing the flow of liquids is viscosity.
Intuitively, viscosity describes the resistance of a liquid to flow.
More technically, viscosity measures the resistance of a liquid to deformation
at a given rate, such as when it is being sheared at finite velocity.[23] A
specific example is a liquid flowing through a pipe: in this case the liquid
undergoes shear deformation since it flows more slowly near the walls of the
pipe than near the center. As a result, it exhibits viscous resistance to flow.
In order to maintain flow, an external force must be applied, such as a
pressure difference between the ends of the pipe.
The viscosity of liquids decreases with increasing temperature.[24] Precise
control of viscosity is important in many applications, particularly the
lubrication industry. One way to achieve such control is by blending two or
more liquids of differing viscosities in precise ratios.[25] In addition,
various additives exist which can modulate the temperature-dependence of the
viscosity of lubricating oils. This capability is important since machinery
often operate over a range of temperatures (see also viscosity_index).[26]
The viscous behavior of a liquid can be either Newtonian or non-Newtonian. A
Newtonian liquid exhibits a linear strain/stress curve, meaning its viscosity
is independent of time, shear rate, or shear-rate history. Examples of
Newtonian liquids include water, glycerin, motor_oil, honey, or mercury. A non-
Newtonian liquid is one where the viscosity is not independent of these factors
and either thickens (increases in viscosity) or thins (decreases in viscosity)
under shear. Examples of non-Newtonian liquids include ketchup, mayonnaise,
hair_gels, play_dough, or starch solutions.[27]
**** Sound propagation ****
Main article: speed_of_sound_Â§ Speed_of_sound_in_liquids
The speed of sound in a liquid is given by     c =   K  /  &#x03C1;
{\displaystyle c={\sqrt {K/\rho }}}  [c={\sqrt {K/\rho }}] where     K
{\displaystyle K}  [K] is the bulk_modulus of the liquid and     &#x03C1;
{\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] the density. As an example, water has a bulk
modulus of about 2.2 GPa and a density of 1000 kg/m3, which gives c = 1.5 km/s.

**** Phase transitions ****
Main articles: boiling, boiling_point, melting, and melting_point
A typical phase_diagram. The dotted line gives the anomalous behaviour of
water. The green lines show how the freezing_point can vary with pressure, and
the blue line shows how the boiling_point can vary with pressure. The red line
shows the boundary where sublimation or deposition can occur.
At a temperature below the boiling_point, any matter in liquid form will
evaporate until the condensation of gas above reach an equilibrium. At this
point the gas will condense at the same rate as the liquid evaporates. Thus, a
liquid cannot exist permanently if the evaporated liquid is continually
removed. A liquid at its boiling_point will evaporate more quickly than the gas
can condense at the current pressure. A liquid at or above its boiling point
will normally boil, though superheating can prevent this in certain
circumstances.
At a temperature below the freezing point, a liquid will tend to crystallize,
changing to its solid form. Unlike the transition to gas, there is no
equilibrium at this transition under constant pressure, so unless supercooling
occurs, the liquid will eventually completely crystallize. Note that this is
only true under constant pressure, so e.g. water and ice in a closed, strong
container might reach an equilibrium where both phases coexist. For the
opposite transition from solid to liquid, see melting.
**** Liquids in space ****
The phase diagram explains why liquids do not exist in space or any other
vacuum. Since the pressure is zero (except on surfaces or interiors of planets
and moons) water and other liquids exposed to space will either immediately
boil or freeze depending on the temperature. In regions of space near the
earth, water will freeze if the sun is not shining directly on it and vapourize
(sublime) as soon as it is in sunlight. If water exists as ice on the moon, it
can only exist in shadowed holes where the sun never shines and where the
surrounding rock doesn't heat it up too much. At some point near the orbit of
Saturn, the light from the sun is too faint to sublime ice to water vapour.
This is evident from the longevity of the ice that composes Saturn's rings.
**** Solutions ****
Main article: solution
Liquids can form solutions with gases, solids, and other liquids.
Two liquids are said to be miscible if they can form a solution in any
proportion; otherwise they are immiscible. As an example, water and ethanol
(drinking alcohol) are miscible whereas water and gasoline are immiscible.[29]
In some cases a mixture of otherwise immiscible liquids can be stabilized to
form an emulsion, where one liquid is dispersed throughout the other as
microscopic droplets. Usually this requires the presence of a surfactant in
order to stabilize the droplets. A familiar example of an emulsion is
mayonnaise, which consists of a mixture of water and oil that is stabilized by
lecithin, a substance found in egg_yolks.[30]
***** Microscopic description *****
The molecules which compose liquids are disordered and strongly interacting,
which makes liquids difficult to describe rigorously at the molecular level.
This stands in contrast with the other two common phases of matter, gases and
solids. Although gases are disordered, they are sufficiently dilute that many-
body interactions can be ignored, and molecular interactions can instead be
modeled in terms of well-defined binary collision events. Conversely, although
solids are dense and strongly interacting, their regular structure at the
molecular level (e.g. a crystalline lattice) allows for significant theoretical
simplifications. For these reasons, the microscopic theory of liquids is less
developed than that of gases and solids.[31]
**** Static structure factor ****
Main article: structure_of_liquids_and_glasses
Structure of a classical monatomic liquid. Atoms have many nearest neighbors in
contact, yet no long-range order is present.
In a liquid, atoms do not form a crystalline lattice, nor do they show any
other form of long-range_order. This is evidenced by the absence of Bragg_peaks
in X-ray and neutron_diffraction. Under normal conditions, the diffraction
pattern has circular symmetry, expressing the isotropy of the liquid. In radial
direction, the diffraction intensity smoothly oscillates. This is usually
described by the static_structure_factor S(q), with wavenumber q=(4Ï/Î»)sinÎ¸
given by the wavelength Î» of the probe (photon or neutron) and the Bragg_angle
Î¸. The oscillations of S(q) express the near order of the liquid, i.e. the
correlations between an atom and a few shells of nearest, second nearest, ...
neighbors.
A more intuitive description of these correlations is given by the radial
distribution_function g(r), which is basically the Fourier_transform of S(q).
It represents a spatial average of a temporal snapshot of pair_correlations in
the liquid.
Radial distribution function of the Lennard-Jones_model_fluid.
**** Sound dispersion and structural relaxation ****
The above expression for the sound velocity     c =   K  /  &#x03C1;
{\displaystyle c={\sqrt {K/\rho }}}  [c={\sqrt {K/\rho }}] contains the bulk
modulus K. If K is frequency independent then the liquid behaves as a linear
medium, so that sound propagates without dissipation and without mode_coupling.
In reality, any liquid shows some dispersion: with increasing frequency, K
crosses over from the low-frequency, liquid-like limit      K  0
{\displaystyle K_{0}}  [K_{0}] to the high-frequency, solid-like limit      K
&#x221E;     {\displaystyle K_{\infty }}  [K_{\infty }]. In normal liquids,
most of this cross over takes place at frequencies between GHz and THz,
sometimes called hypersound.
At sub-GHz frequencies, a normal liquid cannot sustain shear_waves: the zero-
frequency limit of the shear_modulus is      G  0   = 0   {\displaystyle G_
{0}=0}  [G_{0}=0]. This is sometimes seen as the defining property of a liquid.
[32][33] However, just as the bulk modulus K, the shear modulus G is frequency
dependent, and at hypersound frequencies it shows a similar cross over from the
liquid-like limit      G  0     {\displaystyle G_{0}}  [G_{0}] to a solid-like,
non-zero limit      G  &#x221E;     {\displaystyle G_{\infty }}  [G_{\infty }].
According to the Kramers-Kronig_relation, the dispersion in the sound velocity
(given by the real part of K or G) goes along with a maximum in the sound
attenuation (dissipation, given by the imaginary part of K or G). According to
linear_response_theory, the Fourier transform of K or G describes how the
system returns to equilibrium after an external perturbation; for this reason,
the dispersion step in the GHz..THz region is also called structural
relaxation. According to the fluctuation-dissipation_theorem, relaxation
towards equilibrium is intimately connected to fluctuations in equilibrium. The
density fluctuations associated with sound waves can be experimentally observed
by Brillouin_scattering.
On supercooling a liquid towards the glass transition, the crossover from
liquid-like to solid-like response moves from GHz to MHz, kHz, Hz, ...;
equivalently, the characteristic time of structural relaxation increases from
ns to Î¼s, ms, s, ... This is the microscopic explanation for the above-
mentioned viscoelastic behaviour of glass-forming liquids.
**** Effects of association ****
The mechanisms of atomic/molecular diffusion (or particle_displacement) in
solids are closely related to the mechanisms of viscous flow and solidification
in liquid materials. Descriptions of viscosity in terms of molecular "free
space" within the liquid[34] were modified as needed in order to account for
liquids whose molecules are known to be "associated" in the liquid state at
ordinary temperatures. When various molecules combine together to form an
associated molecule, they enclose within a semi-rigid system a certain amount
of space which before was available as free space for mobile molecules. Thus,
increase in viscosity upon cooling due to the tendency of most substances to
become associated on cooling.[35]
Similar arguments could be used to describe the effects of pressure on
viscosity, where it may be assumed that the viscosity is chiefly a function of
the volume for liquids with a finite compressibility. An increasing viscosity
with rise of pressure is therefore expected. In addition, if the volume is
expanded by heat but reduced again by pressure, the viscosity remains the same.
The local tendency to orientation of molecules in small groups lends the liquid
(as referred to previously) a certain degree of association. This association
results in a considerable "internal pressure" within a liquid, which is due
almost entirely to those molecules which, on account of their temporary low
velocities (following the Maxwell distribution) have coalesced with other
molecules. The internal pressure between several such molecules might
correspond to that between a group of molecules in the solid form.
