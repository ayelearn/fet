Torque, moment, moment of force or "turning effect" is the rotational
equivalent of linear force.[1] The concept originated with the studies of
Archimedes on the usage of levers. Just as a linear force is a push or a pull,
a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. Another definition of
torque is the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular
distance of the line of action of force from the axis of rotation. The symbol
for torque is typically      &#x03C4;    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}
[{\boldsymbol {\tau }}], the lowercase Greek_letter tau. When being referred to
as moment of force, it is commonly denoted by M.
In three dimensions, the torque is a pseudovector; for point particles, it is
given by the cross_product of the position vector (distance_vector) and the
force vector. The magnitude of torque of a rigid body depends on three
quantities: the force applied, the lever arm vector[2] connecting the origin to
the point of force application, and the angle between the force and lever arm
vectors. In symbols:
          &#x03C4;  =  r  &#x00D7;  F      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau
      }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} \,\!}  [{\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf
      {r} \times \mathbf {F} \,\!]
         &#x03C4; = &#x2016;  r  &#x2016;  &#x2016;  F  &#x2016; sin &#x2061;
      &#x03B8;     {\displaystyle \tau =\|\mathbf {r} \|\,\|\mathbf {F} \|\sin
      \theta \,\!}  [\tau =\|\mathbf {r} \|\,\|\mathbf {F} \|\sin \theta \,\!]
where
          &#x03C4;    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}  [{\boldsymbol
      {\tau }}] is the torque vector and     &#x03C4;   {\displaystyle \tau }
      [\tau ] is the magnitude of the torque,
      r is the position vector (a vector from the origin of the coordinate
      system defined to the point where the force is applied)
      F is the force vector,
      Ã denotes the cross_product, which produces a vector that is
      perpendicular to both r and F following the right-hand_rule,
         &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle \theta }  [ \theta] is the angle between the
      force vector and the lever arm vector.
The SI_unit for torque is Nâm. For more on the units of torque, see Units.

***** Defining terminology[edit] *****
See also: Couple_(mechanics)
The term torque was introduced into English scientific literature by James
Thomson, the brother of Lord_Kelvin, in 1884.[3] However, torque is referred to
using different vocabulary depending on geographical location and field of
study. This article refers to the definition used in US physics in its usage of
the word torque.[4] In the UK and in US mechanical_engineering, torque is
referred to as moment of force, usually shortened to moment.[5] In US physics
[4] and UK physics terminology these terms are interchangeable, unlike in US
mechanical engineering, where the term torque is used for the closely related
"resultant moment of a couple".[5]
Torque is defined mathematically as the rate of change of angular_momentum of
an object. The definition of torque states that one or both of the angular
velocity or the moment_of_inertia of an object are changing. Moment is the
general term used for the tendency of one or more applied forces to rotate an
object about an axis, but not necessarily to change the angular momentum of the
object (the concept which is called torque in physics).[5] For example, a
rotational force applied to a shaft causing acceleration, such as a drill bit
accelerating from rest, results in a moment called a torque. By contrast, a
lateral force on a beam produces a moment (called a bending_moment), but since
the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this bending moment is not
called a torque. Similarly with any force couple on an object that has no
change to its angular momentum, such moment is also not called a torque.
***** Definition and relation to angular momentum[edit] *****
A particle is located at position r relative to its axis of rotation. When a
force F is applied to the particle, only the perpendicular component Fâ¥
produces a torque. This torque Ï = r Ã F has magnitude
Ï = |r| |Fâ¥| = |r| |F| sin Î¸ and is directed outward from the page.
A force applied at a right angle to a lever multiplied by its distance from the
lever's_fulcrum (the length of the lever_arm) is its torque. A force of three
newtons applied two metres from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same
torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The
direction of the torque can be determined by using the right_hand_grip_rule: if
the fingers of the right hand are curled from the direction of the lever arm to
the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the
torque.[6]
More generally, the torque on a point particle (which has the position r in
some reference frame) can be defined as the cross_product:
          &#x03C4;  =  r  &#x00D7;  F  ,   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau
      }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} ,}  [{\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {r}
      \times \mathbf {F} ,]
where r is the particle's position_vector relative to the fulcrum, and F is the
force acting on the particle. The magnitude Ï of the torque is given by
         &#x03C4; = r F sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; ,    {\displaystyle \tau =rF\sin
      \theta ,\!}  [\tau =rF\sin \theta ,\!]
where r is the distance from the axis of rotation to the particle, F is the
magnitude of the force applied, and Î¸ is the angle between the position and
force vectors. Alternatively,
         &#x03C4; = r  F  &#x22A5;   ,   {\displaystyle \tau =rF_{\perp },}
      [\tau =rF_{\perp },]
where Fâ¥ is the amount of force directed perpendicularly to the position of
the particle. Any force directed parallel to the particle's position vector
does not produce a torque.[7][8]
It follows from the properties of the cross product that the torque vector is
perpendicular to both the position and force vectors. Conversely, the torque
vector defines the plane in which the position and force vectors lie. The
resulting torque vector direction is determined by the right-hand rule.[7]
The net torque on a body determines the rate of change of the body's angular
momentum,
          &#x03C4;  =     d   L     d  t      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau
      }}={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}}  [{\boldsymbol
      {\tau }}={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}]
where L is the angular momentum vector and t is time.
For the motion of a point particle,
          L  = I  &#x03C9;  ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol
      {\omega }},}  [\mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol {\omega }},]
where I is the moment_of_inertia and Ï is the orbital angular_velocity
pseudovector. It follows that
           &#x03C4;    n e t    =     d   L     d  t    =     d  ( I  &#x03C9;
      )    d  t    = I     d   &#x03C9;     d  t    +     d  I    d  t
      &#x03C9;  = I  &#x03B1;  +     d  ( m  r  2   )    d  t     &#x03C9;  = I
      &#x03B1;  + 2 r  p   |   |     &#x03C9;  ,   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol
      {\tau }}_{\mathrm {net} }={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d}
      t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} (I{\boldsymbol {\omega }})}{\mathrm {d} t}}=I
      {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} I}{\mathrm {d} t}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}=I{\boldsymbol
      {\alpha }}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} (mr^{2})}{\mathrm {d} t}}{\boldsymbol
      {\omega }}=I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}+2rp_{||}{\boldsymbol {\omega }},}  [
      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{\mathrm {net} }={\frac {\mathrm {d}
      \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} (I{\boldsymbol {\omega
      }})}{\mathrm {d} t}}=I{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}
      {\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} I}{\mathrm {d} t}}{\boldsymbol
      {\omega }}=I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} (mr^{2})}{\mathrm
      {d} t}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}=I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}+2rp_{||}
      {\boldsymbol {\omega }},}]
where Î± is the angular_acceleration of the particle, and p|| is the radial
component of its linear_momentum. This equation is the rotational analogue of
Newton's_Second_Law for point particles, and is valid for any type of
trajectory. Note that although force and acceleration are always parallel and
directly proportional, the torque Ï need not be parallel or directly
proportional to the angular acceleration Î±. This arises from the fact that
although mass is always conserved, the moment of inertia in general is not.
**** Proof of the equivalence of definitions[edit] ****
The definition of angular momentum for a single point particle is:
          L  =  r  &#x00D7;  p    {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r}
      \times {\boldsymbol {p}}}  [\mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times {\boldsymbol
      {p}}]
where p is the particle's linear_momentum and r is the position vector from the
origin. The time-derivative of this is:
             d   L     d  t    =  r  &#x00D7;     d   p     d  t    +     d   r
      d  t    &#x00D7;  p  .   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }
      {\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {r} \times {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol
      {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }{\mathrm {d}
      t}}\times {\boldsymbol {p}}.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d}
      \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {r} \times {\frac {\mathrm {d}
      {\boldsymbol {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }
      {\mathrm {d} t}}\times {\boldsymbol {p}}.}]
This result can easily be proven by splitting the vectors into components and
applying the product_rule. Now using the definition of force      F  =     d
p     d  t      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol
{p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathrm {d}
{\boldsymbol {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}}] (whether or not mass is constant) and the
definition of velocity         d   r     d  t    =  v    {\displaystyle {\frac
{\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {v} }  [{\displaystyle
{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {v} }]
             d   L     d  t    =  r  &#x00D7;  F  +  v  &#x00D7;  p  .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf
      {r} \times \mathbf {F} +\mathbf {v} \times {\boldsymbol {p}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf
      {r} \times \mathbf {F} +\mathbf {v} \times {\boldsymbol {p}}.}]
The cross product of momentum      p    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}}  [
{\boldsymbol {p}}] with its associated velocity      v    {\displaystyle
\mathbf {v} }  [\mathbf {v} ] is zero because velocity and momentum are
parallel, so the second term vanishes.
By definition, torque Ï = r Ã F. Therefore, torque on a particle is equal to
the first_derivative of its angular momentum with respect to time.
If multiple forces are applied, Newton's second law instead reads Fnet = ma,
and it follows that
             d   L     d  t    =  r  &#x00D7;   F    n e t    =   &#x03C4;    n
      e t    .   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d}
      t}}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {net} }={\boldsymbol {\tau
      }}_{\mathrm {net} }.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }
      {\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {net} }=
      {\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{\mathrm {net} }.}]
This is a general proof for point particles.
The proof can be generalized to a system of point particles by applying the
above proof to each of the point particles and then summing over all the point
particles. Similarly, the proof can be generalized to a continuous mass by
applying the above proof to each point within the mass, and then integrating
over the entire mass.
***** Units[edit] *****
Torque has the dimension of force times distance, symbolically L2MTâ2.
Official SI literature suggests using the unit newton_metre (Nâm), or, joule
per radian (J/rad).[9] The unit newton metre is properly denoted Nâm rather
than mÂ·N to avoid confusion with mN, millinewtons.[10]
The SI unit for energy or work is the joule. The presence of "joule" in the
unit name joules per radian for torque is not a coincidence: a torque of
1 Nâm applied through a full revolution will require an energy of exactly 2Ï
joules. Mathematically,
         E = &#x03C4; &#x03B8; &#xA0;   {\displaystyle E=\tau \theta \ }
      [E=\tau \theta \ ]
where E is the energy, Ï is magnitude of the torque, and Î¸ is the angle moved
(in radians). This explains the physical significance of the name joule per
radian.[9]
***** Special cases and other facts[edit] *****
**** Moment arm formula[edit] ****
Moment arm diagram
A very useful special case, often given as the definition of torque in fields
other than physics, is as follows:
         &#x03C4; = (  moment arm  ) (  force  ) .   {\displaystyle \tau =(
      {\text{moment arm}})({\text{force}}).}  [\tau =({\text{moment arm}})(
      {\text{force}}).]
The construction of the "moment arm" is shown in the figure to the right, along
with the vectors r and F mentioned above. The problem with this definition is
that it does not give the direction of the torque but only the magnitude, and
hence it is difficult to use in three-dimensional cases. If the force is
perpendicular to the displacement vector r, the moment arm will be equal to the
distance to the centre, and torque will be a maximum for the given force. The
equation for the magnitude of a torque, arising from a perpendicular force:
         &#x03C4; = (  distance to centre  ) (  force  ) .   {\displaystyle
      \tau =({\text{distance to centre}})({\text{force}}).}  [\tau =({\text
      {distance to centre}})({\text{force}}).]
For example, if a person places a force of 10 N at the terminal end of a wrench
that is 0.5 m long (or a force of 10 N exactly 0.5 m from the twist point of a
wrench of any length), the torque will be 5 N⋅m â assuming that the person
moves the wrench by applying force in the plane of movement and perpendicular
to the wrench.
The torque caused by the two opposing forces Fg and âFg causes a change in
the angular momentum L in the direction of that torque. This causes the top to
precess.
**** Static equilibrium[edit] ****
For an object to be in static_equilibrium, not only must the sum of the forces
be zero, but also the sum of the torques (moments) about any point. For a two-
dimensional situation with horizontal and vertical forces, the sum of the
forces requirement is two equations: Î£H = 0 and Î£V = 0, and the torque a
third equation: Î£Ï = 0. That is, to solve statically_determinate equilibrium
problems in two-dimensions, three equations are used.
**** Net force versus torque[edit] ****
When the net force on the system is zero, the torque measured from any point in
space is the same. For example, the torque on a current-carrying loop in a
uniform magnetic field is the same regardless of your point of reference. If
the net force      F    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }  [\mathbf {F} ] is not
zero, and       &#x03C4;   1     {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{1}}  [
{\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{1}] is the torque measured from       r   1
{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{1}}  [\mathbf {r} _{1}], then the torque measured
from       r   2     {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{2}}  [\mathbf {r} _{2}] is
â¦       &#x03C4;   2   =   &#x03C4;   1   + (   r   1   &#x2212;   r   2   )
&#x00D7;  F    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{2}={\boldsymbol {\tau }}_
{1}+(\mathbf {r} _{1}-\mathbf {r} _{2})\times \mathbf {F} }  [{\boldsymbol
{\tau }}_{2}={\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{1}+(\mathbf {r} _{1}-\mathbf {r} _
{2})\times \mathbf {F} ]
***** Machine torque[edit] *****
Torque curve of a motorcycle ("BMW K 1200 R 2005"). The horizontal axis shows
the speed (in rpm) that the crankshaft is turning, and the vertical axis is the
torque (in newton_metres) that the engine is capable of providing at that
speed.
Torque forms part of the basic specification of an engine: the power output of
an engine is expressed as its torque multiplied by its rotational speed of the
axis. Internal-combustion engines produce useful torque only over a limited
range of rotational speeds (typically from around 1,000â6,000 rpm for a small
car). One can measure the varying torque output over that range with a
dynamometer, and show it as a torque curve.
Steam_engines and electric_motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero
rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing
friction and other constraints). Reciprocating steam-engines and electric
motors can start heavy loads from zero rpm without a clutch.
***** Relationship between torque, power, and energy[edit] *****
If a force is allowed to act through a distance, it is doing mechanical_work.
Similarly, if torque is allowed to act through a rotational distance, it is
doing work. Mathematically, for rotation about a fixed axis through the center
of_mass,
         W =  &#x222B;   &#x03B8;  1      &#x03B8;  2     &#x03C4; &#xA0;  d
      &#x03B8; ,   {\displaystyle W=\int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}\tau \
      \mathrm {d} \theta ,}  [W=\int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}\tau \ \mathrm
      {d} \theta ,]
where W is work, Ï is torque, and Î¸1 and Î¸2 represent (respectively) the
initial and final angular_positions of the body.[11]
**** Proof[edit] ****
The work done by a variable force acting over a finite linear displacement
s   {\displaystyle s}  [s] is given by integrating the force with respect to an
elemental linear displacement      d     s &#x2192;      {\displaystyle \mathrm
{d} {\vec {s}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {\vec {s}}}]
         W =  &#x222B;   s  1      s  2        F &#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d     s
      &#x2192;      {\displaystyle W=\int _{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}{\vec {F}}\cdot
      \mathrm {d} {\vec {s}}}  [{\displaystyle W=\int _{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}{\vec
      {F}}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec {s}}}]
However, the infinitesimal linear displacement      d     s &#x2192;
{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {\vec {s}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {\vec
{s}}}] is related to a corresponding angular displacement      d     &#x03B8;
&#x2192;      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}}  [{\displaystyle
\mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}}] and the radius vector        r &#x2192;
{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}  [{\vec {r}}] as
          d     s &#x2192;    =  d     &#x03B8; &#x2192;    &#x00D7;    r
      &#x2192;      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {\vec {s}}=\mathrm {d} {\vec
      {\theta }}\times {\vec {r}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {\vec
      {s}}=\mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}\times {\vec {r}}}]
Substitution in the above expression for work gives
         W =  &#x222B;   s  1      s  2        F &#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d

      {s_{1}}^{s_{2}}{\vec {F}}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}\times {\vec
      {r}}}  [{\displaystyle W=\int _{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}{\vec {F}}\cdot \mathrm {d}
      {\vec {\theta }}\times {\vec {r}}}]
The expression        F &#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d     &#x03B8; &#x2192;
&#x00D7;    r &#x2192;      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec
{\theta }}\times {\vec {r}}}  [{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec
{\theta }}\times {\vec {r}}}] is a scalar_triple_product given by      [     F
&#x2192;      d     &#x03B8; &#x2192;        r &#x2192;     ]    {\displaystyle
\left[{\vec {F}}\,\mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}\,{\vec {r}}\right]}  [
{\displaystyle \left[{\vec {F}}\,\mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}\,{\vec
{r}}\right]}]. An alternate expression for the same scalar triple product is
          [     F &#x2192;      d     &#x03B8; &#x2192;        r &#x2192;     ]
      =    r &#x2192;    &#x00D7;    F &#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d     &#x03B8;
      &#x2192;      {\displaystyle \left[{\vec {F}}\,\mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta
      }}\,{\vec {r}}\right]={\vec {r}}\times {\vec {F}}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec
      {\theta }}}  [{\displaystyle \left[{\vec {F}}\,\mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta
      }}\,{\vec {r}}\right]={\vec {r}}\times {\vec {F}}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec
      {\theta }}}]
But as per the definition of torque,
            &#x03C4; &#x2192;    =    r &#x2192;    &#x00D7;    F &#x2192;
      {\displaystyle {\vec {\tau }}={\vec {r}}\times {\vec {F}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\vec {\tau }}={\vec {r}}\times {\vec {F}}}]
Corresponding substitution in the expression of work gives,
         W =  &#x222B;   s  1      s  2        &#x03C4; &#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d
      &#x03B8; &#x2192;      {\displaystyle W=\int _{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}{\vec {\tau
      }}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}}  [{\displaystyle W=\int _{s_{1}}^
      {s_{2}}{\vec {\tau }}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}}]
Since the parameter of integration has been changed from linear displacement to
angular displacement, the limits of the integration also change
correspondingly, giving
         W =  &#x222B;   &#x03B8;  1      &#x03B8;  2        &#x03C4; &#x2192;
      &#x22C5;  d     &#x03B8; &#x2192;      {\displaystyle W=\int _{\theta _
      {1}}^{\theta _{2}}{\vec {\tau }}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}}  [
      {\displaystyle W=\int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}{\vec {\tau }}\cdot
      \mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}}]
If the torque and the angular displacement are in the same direction, then the
scalar product reduces to a product of magnitudes; i.e.,        &#x03C4;
&#x2192;    &#x22C5;  d     &#x03B8; &#x2192;    =  |    &#x03C4; &#x2192;    |
|    d     &#x03B8; &#x2192;     |  cos &#x2061; 0 = &#x03C4;   d  &#x03B8;
{\displaystyle {\vec {\tau }}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}=\left|{\vec
{\tau }}\right|\left|\,\mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}\right|\cos 0=\tau \,\mathrm
{d} \theta }  [{\displaystyle {\vec {\tau }}\cdot \mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta
}}=\left|{\vec {\tau }}\right|\left|\,\mathrm {d} {\vec {\theta }}\right|\cos
0=\tau \,\mathrm {d} \theta }] giving
         W =  &#x222B;   &#x03B8;  1      &#x03B8;  2     &#x03C4;   d
      &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle W=\int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}\tau
      \,\mathrm {d} \theta }  [{\displaystyle W=\int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _
      {2}}\tau \,\mathrm {d} \theta }]
It follows from the work-energy_theorem that W also represents the change in
the rotational_kinetic_energy Er of the body, given by
          E   r    =    1 2    I  &#x03C9;  2   ,   {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm
      {r} }={\tfrac {1}{2}}I\omega ^{2},}  [E_{\mathrm {r} }={\tfrac {1}
      {2}}I\omega ^{2},]
where I is the moment_of_inertia of the body and Ï is its angular_speed.[11]
Power is the work per unit time, given by
         P =  &#x03C4;  &#x22C5;  &#x03C9;  ,   {\displaystyle P={\boldsymbol
      {\tau }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }},}  [{\displaystyle P={\boldsymbol
      {\tau }}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }},}]
where P is power, Ï is torque, Ï is the angular_velocity, and ⋅ represents
the scalar_product.
Algebraically, the equation may be rearranged to compute torque for a given
angular speed and power output. Note that the power injected by the torque
depends only on the instantaneous angular speed â not on whether the angular
speed increases, decreases, or remains constant while the torque is being
applied (this is equivalent to the linear case where the power injected by a
force depends only on the instantaneous speed â not on the resulting
acceleration, if any).
In practice, this relationship can be observed in bicycles: Bicycles are
typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as
sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur_mechanism if the
bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e.
multi-speed_bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person
who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby
cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input
power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the
number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the
bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the
road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output
power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear_ratio of the bicycle, a (torque,
rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger
rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular
speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of
which (i.e. power) does not change.
Consistent units must be used. For metric SI units, power is watts, torque is
newton_metres and angular speed is radians per second (not rpm and not
revolutions per second).
Also, the unit newton metre is dimensionally_equivalent to the joule, which is
the unit of energy. However, in the case of torque, the unit is assigned to a
vector, whereas for energy, it is assigned to a scalar. This means that the
dimensional equivalence of the newton metre and the joule may be applied in the
former, but not in the latter case. This problem is addressed in orientational
analysis which treats radians as a base unit rather than a dimensionless unit.
[12]
**** Conversion to other units[edit] ****
A conversion factor may be necessary when using different units of power or
torque. For example, if rotational_speed (revolutions per time) is used in
place of angular speed (radians per time), we multiply by a factor of 2Ï
radians per revolution. In the following formulas, P is power, Ï is torque,
and Î½ (Greek_letter_nu) is rotational speed.
         P = &#x03C4; &#x22C5; 2 &#x03C0; &#x22C5; &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle
      P=\tau \cdot 2\pi \cdot \nu }  [{\displaystyle P=\tau \cdot 2\pi \cdot
      \nu }]
Showing units:
         P (   W   ) = &#x03C4;   ( N &#x22C5; m )   &#x22C5; 2 &#x03C0;   ( r
      a d  /  r e v )   &#x22C5; &#x03BD;   ( r e v  /  s e c )
      {\displaystyle P({\rm {W}})=\tau {\rm {(N\cdot m)}}\cdot 2\pi {\rm {(rad/
      rev)}}\cdot \nu {\rm {(rev/sec)}}}  [{\displaystyle P({\rm {W}})=\tau
      {\rm {(N\cdot m)}}\cdot 2\pi {\rm {(rad/rev)}}\cdot \nu {\rm {(rev/
      sec)}}}]
Dividing by 60 seconds per minute gives us the following.
         P (   W   ) =    &#x03C4;   ( N &#x22C5; m )   &#x22C5; 2 &#x03C0;
      ( r a d  /  r e v )   &#x22C5; &#x03BD;   ( r p m )    60
      {\displaystyle P({\rm {W}})={\frac {\tau {\rm {(N\cdot m)}}\cdot 2\pi
      {\rm {(rad/rev)}}\cdot \nu {\rm {(rpm)}}}{60}}}  [{\displaystyle P({\rm
      {W}})={\frac {\tau {\rm {(N\cdot m)}}\cdot 2\pi {\rm {(rad/rev)}}\cdot
      \nu {\rm {(rpm)}}}{60}}}]
where rotational speed is in revolutions per minute (rpm).
Some people (e.g., American automotive engineers) use horsepower (imperial
mechanical) for power, foot-pounds (lbfâft) for torque and rpm for rotational
speed. This results in the formula changing to:
         P (   h p   ) =    &#x03C4;   ( l b f &#x22C5; f t )   &#x22C5; 2
      &#x03C0;   ( r a d  /  r e v )   &#x22C5; &#x03BD; (   r p m   )   33 ,
      000    .   {\displaystyle P({\rm {hp}})={\frac {\tau {\rm {(lbf\cdot
      ft)}}\cdot 2\pi {\rm {(rad/rev)}}\cdot \nu ({\rm {rpm}})}{33,000}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle P({\rm {hp}})={\frac {\tau {\rm {(lbf\cdot ft)}}\cdot 2\pi
      {\rm {(rad/rev)}}\cdot \nu ({\rm {rpm}})}{33,000}}.}]
The constant below (in foot pounds per minute) changes with the definition of
the horsepower; for example, using metric horsepower, it becomes approximately
32,550.
Use of other units (e.g., BTU per hour for power) would require a different
custom conversion factor.
**** Derivation[edit] ****
For a rotating object, the linear distance covered at the circumference of
rotation is the product of the radius with the angle covered. That is: linear
distance = radius Ã angular distance. And by definition, linear distance =
linear speed Ã time = radius Ã angular speed Ã time.
By the definition of torque: torque = radius Ã force. We can rearrange this to
determine force = torque Ã· radius. These two values can be substituted into
the definition of power:
              power     =     force  &#x22C5;  linear distance   time         =
      (    torque r    )  &#x22C5; ( r &#x22C5;  angular speed  &#x22C5; t )  t
      =  torque  &#x22C5;  angular speed  .       {\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}{\text{power}}&={\frac {{\text{force}}\cdot {\text{linear
      distance}}}{\text{time}}}\\[6pt]&={\frac {\left({\dfrac {\text{torque}}
      {r}}\right)\cdot (r\cdot {\text{angular speed}}\cdot t)}{t}}\\[6pt]&=
      {\text{torque}}\cdot {\text{angular speed}}.\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\text{power}}&={\frac {{\text
      {force}}\cdot {\text{linear distance}}}{\text{time}}}\\[6pt]&={\frac
      {\left({\dfrac {\text{torque}}{r}}\right)\cdot (r\cdot {\text{angular
      speed}}\cdot t)}{t}}\\[6pt]&={\text{torque}}\cdot {\text{angular
      speed}}.\end{aligned}}}]
The radius r and time t have dropped out of the equation. However, angular
speed must be in radians, by the assumed direct relationship between linear
speed and angular speed at the beginning of the derivation. If the rotational
speed is measured in revolutions per unit of time, the linear speed and
distance are increased proportionately by 2Ï in the above derivation to give:
          power  =  torque  &#x22C5; 2 &#x03C0; &#x22C5;  rotational speed  .
      {\displaystyle {\text{power}}={\text{torque}}\cdot 2\pi \cdot {\text
      {rotational speed}}.\,}  [{\displaystyle {\text{power}}={\text
      {torque}}\cdot 2\pi \cdot {\text{rotational speed}}.\,}]
If torque is in newton metres and rotational speed in revolutions per second,
the above equation gives power in newton metres per second or watts. If
Imperial units are used, and if torque is in pounds-force feet and rotational
speed in revolutions per minute, the above equation gives power in foot pounds-
force per minute. The horsepower form of the equation is then derived by
applying the conversion factor 33,000 ftâlbf/min per horsepower:
              power     =  torque  &#x22C5; 2 &#x03C0; &#x22C5;  rotational
      speed  &#x22C5;     ft  &#x22C5;  lbf   min   &#x22C5;   horsepower  33 ,

      {power}}&={\text{torque}}\cdot 2\pi \cdot {\text{rotational speed}}\cdot
      {\frac {{\text{ft}}\cdot {\text{lbf}}}{\text{min}}}\cdot {\frac {\text
      {horsepower}}{33,000\cdot {\frac {{\text{ft}}\cdot {\text{lbf}}}{\text

      {horsepower}}{33,000\cdot {\frac {{\text{ft}}\cdot {\text{lbf}}}{\text
      {min}}}}}\\[6pt]&\approx {\frac {{\text{torque}}\cdot {\text{RPM}}}
      {5,252}}\end{aligned}}}]
because     5252.113122 &#x2248;    33 , 000   2 &#x03C0;    .
{\displaystyle 5252.113122\approx {\frac {33,000}{2\pi }}.\,}
[5252.113122\approx {\frac {33,000}{2\pi }}.\,]
***** Principle of moments[edit] *****
The Principle of Moments, also known as Varignon's theorem (not to be confused
with the geometrical_theorem of the same name) states that the sum of torques
due to several forces applied to a single point is equal to the torque due to
the sum (resultant) of the forces. Mathematically, this follows from:
         (  r  &#x00D7;   F   1   ) + (  r  &#x00D7;   F   2   ) + &#x22EF; =
      r  &#x00D7; (   F   1   +   F   2   + &#x22EF; ) .   {\displaystyle
      (\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} _{1})+(\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} _
      {2})+\cdots =\mathbf {r} \times (\mathbf {F} _{1}+\mathbf {F} _{2}+\cdots
      ).}  [(\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} _{1})+(\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf
      {F} _{2})+\cdots =\mathbf {r} \times (\mathbf {F} _{1}+\mathbf {F} _
      {2}+\cdots ).]
***** Torque multiplier[edit] *****
Main article: Torque_multiplier
Torque can be multiplied via three methods: by locating the fulcrum such that
the length of a lever is increased; by using a longer lever; or by the use of a
speed reducing gearset or gear_box. Such a mechanism multiplies torque, as
rotation rate is reduced.
