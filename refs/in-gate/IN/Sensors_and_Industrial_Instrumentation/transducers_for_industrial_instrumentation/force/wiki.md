Forces can be described as a push or pull on an object. They can be due to
phenomena such as gravity, magnetism, or anything that might cause a mass to
accelerate.

In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the
motion of an object. A force can cause an object with mass to change its
velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state_of_rest), i.e., to
accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A
force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is
measured in the SI_unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.
The original form of Newton's_second_law states that the net force acting upon
an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time. If the
mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an
object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in
the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of
the object.
Concepts related to force include: thrust, which increases the velocity of an
object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which
produces changes_in_rotational_speed of an object. In an extended body, each
part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such
forces through the body is the internal mechanical_stress. Such internal
mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance
one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an
area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the
body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or
flow in fluids.

***** Development of the concept *****
Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary
and moving objects and simple_machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and
Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was
due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of
friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion.
[1] A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain
motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings
about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo_Galilei and Sir
Isaac_Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir_Isaac_Newton formulated laws
of_motion that were not improved for nearly three hundred years.[2] By the
early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory_of_relativity that correctly
predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the
speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by
gravitation and inertia.
With modern insights into quantum_mechanics and technology that can accelerate
particles close to the speed of light, particle_physics has devised a Standard
Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard
Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge_bosons are the fundamental
means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are
known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic,
weak, and gravitational.[3]:2â10[4]:79 High-energy_particle_physics
observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and
electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak
interaction.[5]
***** Pre-Newtonian concepts *****
See also: Aristotelian_physics and Theory_of_impetus
Aristotle famously described a force as anything that causes an object to
undergo "unnatural motion"
Since antiquity the concept of force has been recognized as integral to the
functioning of each of the simple_machines. The mechanical_advantage given by a
simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force
acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the
characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who
was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant_forces inherent in
fluids.[1]
Aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an
integral part of Aristotelian_cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial
sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different "natural places"
therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed
mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the
ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between
the innate tendency of objects to find their "natural place" (e.g., for heavy
bodies to fall), which led to "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion,
which required continued application of a force.[6] This theory, based on the
everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a
force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the
behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the
archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the
projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it.
Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through
the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation
demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.[7]
Aristotelian_physics began facing criticism in medieval_science, first by John
Philoponus in the 6th century.
The shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the
17th century work of Galileo_Galilei, who was influenced by the late medieval
idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus. Galileo
constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down
an incline to disprove the Aristotelian_theory_of_motion. He showed that the
bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their
mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force,
for example friction.[8]
***** Newtonian mechanics *****
Main article: Newton's_laws_of_motion
Sir Isaac Newton described the motion of all objects using the concepts of
inertia and force, and in doing so he found they obey certain conservation
laws. In 1687, Newton published his thesis PhilosophiÃ¦_Naturalis_Principia
Mathematica.[2][9] In this work Newton set out three laws of motion that to
this day are the way forces are described in physics.[9]
**** First law ****
Main article: Newton's_first_law
Newton's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of
constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net_force (resultant force).
[9] This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was
associated with a lack of net force (see a_more_detailed_description_of_this
below). Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that
functions as the fundamental equilibrium "natural state" in place of the
Aristotelian idea of the "natural state of rest". That is, Newton's empirical
First Law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is
required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making rest
physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity, Newton's First
Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative_velocities.
Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it
is impossible to determine which object is "in motion" and which object is "at
rest". The laws of physics are the same in every inertial_frame_of_reference,
that is, in all frames related by a Galilean_transformation.
For instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity, the
laws of physics do not change as a result of its motion. If a person riding
within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise
vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in the direction
the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by,
would observe the ball follow a curving parabolic_path in the same direction as
the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its
constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the
ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down.
From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything
inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant
speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment
that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside
world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically
indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity
motion as it does to rest.
Though Sir_Isaac_Newton's most famous equation is
         F &#x2192;    = m    a &#x2192;        {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {
{\vec {F}}=m{\vec {a}}}}  [\scriptstyle {{\vec {F}}=m{\vec {a}}}], he actually
wrote down a different form for his second law of motion that did not use
differential_calculus.
**** Second law ****
Main article: Newton's_second_law
A modern statement of Newton's Second Law is a vector equation:[Note_1]
            F &#x2192;    =     d     p &#x2192;       d  t    ,
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d}
      t}},}  [{\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}},]
where        p &#x2192;      {\displaystyle {\vec {p}}}  [ \vec{p}] is the
momentum of the system, and        F &#x2192;      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}}
[{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}}] is the net (vector_sum) force. If a body is in
equilibrium, there is zero net force by definition (balanced forces may be
present nevertheless). In contrast, the second law states that if there is an
unbalanced force acting on an object it will result in the object's momentum
changing over time.[9]
By the definition of momentum,
            F &#x2192;    =     d     p &#x2192;       d  t    =     d   (  m
      v &#x2192;     )     d  t    ,   {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}={\frac
      {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} \left(m{\vec
      {v}}\right)}{\mathrm {d} t}},}  [{\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec
      {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} \left(m{\vec {v}}\right)}
      {\mathrm {d} t}},]
where m is the mass and        v &#x2192;      {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}  [
{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}] is the velocity.[3]:9-1, 9-2
If Newton's second law is applied to a system of constant_mass,[Note_2] m may
be moved outside the derivative operator. The equation then becomes
            F &#x2192;    = m     d     v &#x2192;       d  t    .
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {v}}}{\mathrm {d}
      t}}.}  [{\vec {F}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {v}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}.]
By substituting the definition of acceleration, the algebraic version of
Newton's_Second_Law is derived:
            F &#x2192;    = m    a &#x2192;    .   {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=m
      {\vec {a}}.}  [{\vec {F}}=m{\vec {a}}.]
Newton never explicitly stated the formula in the reduced form above.[10]
Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force
and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be
defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-
described through reference_frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still
deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass. General
relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a
coherent theory of quantum_gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this
connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second
law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an
equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.
The use of Newton's Second Law as a definition of force has been disparaged in
some of the more rigorous textbooks,[3]:12-1[4]:59[11] because it is
essentially a mathematical truism. Notable physicists, philosophers and
mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of
force include Ernst_Mach and Walter_Noll.[12][13]
Newton's Second Law can be used to measure the strength of forces. For
instance, knowledge of the masses of planets along with the accelerations of
their orbits allows scientists to calculate the gravitational forces on
planets.
**** Third law ****
Main article: Newton's_third_law
Whenever one body exerts a force on another, the latter simultaneously exerts
an equal and opposite force on the first. In vector form, if          F
&#x2192;     1 , 2      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}}  [
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}}] is the force of body 1 on body 2
and          F &#x2192;     2 , 1      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_
{2,1}}  [{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{2,1}}] that of body 2 on body
1, then
             F &#x2192;     1 , 2   = &#x2212;     F &#x2192;     2 , 1   .
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}=-{\vec {F}}_{2,1}.}  [{\vec {F}}_{1,2}=-
      {\vec {F}}_{2,1}.]
This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with          F
&#x2192;     1 , 2      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}}  [
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}}] called the action and
&#x2212;     F &#x2192;     2 , 1      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle -{\vec {F}}_
{2,1}}  [{\displaystyle \scriptstyle -{\vec {F}}_{2,1}}] the reaction.
Newton's Third Law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces
can be attributed to the presence of different objects. The third law means
that all forces are interactions between different bodies,[14][Note_3] and thus
that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on
only one body.
In a system composed of object 1 and object 2, the net force on the system due
to their mutual interactions is zero:
             F &#x2192;     1 , 2   +     F &#x2192;      2 , 1    = 0.
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}+{\vec {F}}_{\mathrm {2,1} }=0.}  [
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}+{\vec {F}}_{\mathrm {2,1} }=0.}]
More generally, in a closed_system of particles, all internal forces are
balanced. The particles may accelerate with respect to each other but the
center_of_mass of the system will not accelerate. If an external force acts on
the system, it will make the center of mass accelerate in proportion to the
magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.[3]:19-1[4]
Combining Newton's Second and Third Laws, it is possible to show that the
linear_momentum_of_a_system_is_conserved.[15] In a system of two particles, if
p &#x2192;     1      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {p}}_{1}}  [
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {p}}_{1}}] is the momentum of object 1 and
p &#x2192;     2      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {p}}_{2}}  [
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {p}}_{2}}] the momentum of object 2, then
             d      p &#x2192;     1      d  t    +     d      p &#x2192;     2
      d  t    =     F &#x2192;     1 , 2   +     F &#x2192;     2 , 1   = 0.
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}_{1}}{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}_{2}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\vec {F}}_{1,2}+{\vec {F}}_
      {2,1}=0.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}_{1}}{\mathrm
      {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}_{2}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\vec {F}}_
      {1,2}+{\vec {F}}_{2,1}=0.}]
Using similar arguments, this can be generalized to a system with an arbitrary
number of particles. In general, as long as all forces are due to the
interaction of objects with mass, it is possible to define a system such that
net momentum is never lost nor gained.[3][4]
***** Special theory of relativity *****
In the special_theory_of_relativity, mass and energy are equivalent (as can be
seen by calculating the work required to accelerate an object). When an
object's velocity increases, so does its energy and hence its mass equivalent
(inertia). It thus requires more force to accelerate it the same amount than it
did at a lower velocity. Newton's Second Law
            F &#x2192;    =     d     p &#x2192;       d  t      {\displaystyle
      {\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d}
      t}}}]
remains valid because it is a mathematical definition.[16]:855â876 But for
relativistic momentum to be conserved, it must be redefined as:
            p &#x2192;    =     m  0      v &#x2192;      1 &#x2212;  v  2    /
      c  2      ,   {\displaystyle {\vec {p}}={\frac {m_{0}{\vec {v}}}{\sqrt
      {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}},}  [{\displaystyle {\vec {p}}={\frac {m_{0}{\vec {v}}}
      {\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}},}]
where      m  0     {\displaystyle m_{0}}  [m_{0}] is the rest_mass and     c
{\displaystyle c}  [c] the speed_of_light.
The relativistic expression relating force and acceleration for a particle with
constant non-zero rest_mass     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] moving in the     x
{\displaystyle x}  [x] direction is:
            F &#x2192;    =  (   &#x03B3;  3   m  a  x   , &#x03B3; m  a  y   ,
      &#x03B3; m  a  z    )  ,   {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=\left(\gamma ^{3}ma_
      {x},\gamma ma_{y},\gamma ma_{z}\right),}  [{\displaystyle {\vec
      {F}}=\left(\gamma ^{3}ma_{x},\gamma ma_{y},\gamma ma_{z}\right),}]
where
         &#x03B3; =   1  1 &#x2212;  v  2    /   c  2      .   {\displaystyle
      \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}.}  [\gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt
      {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}.]
is called the Lorentz_factor.[17]
In the early history of relativity, the expressions      &#x03B3;  3   m
{\displaystyle \gamma ^{3}m}  [\gamma ^{3}m] and     &#x03B3; m
{\displaystyle \gamma m}  [\gamma m] were called longitudinal_and_transverse
mass. Relativistic force does not produce a constant acceleration, but an ever-
decreasing acceleration as the object approaches the speed of light. Note that
&#x03B3;   {\displaystyle \gamma }  [\gamma ] approaches asymptotically an
infinite value and is undefined for an object with a non-zero rest_mass as it
approaches the speed of light, and the theory yields no prediction at that
speed.
If     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] is very small compared to     c
{\displaystyle c}  [c], then     &#x03B3;   {\displaystyle \gamma }  [\gamma ]
is very close to 1 and
         F = m a   {\displaystyle F=ma}  [F=ma]
is a close approximation. Even for use in relativity, however, one can restore
the form of
          F  &#x03BC;   = m  A  &#x03BC;      {\displaystyle F^{\mu }=mA^{\mu
      }\,}  [F^{\mu }=mA^{\mu }\,]
through the use of four-vectors. This relation is correct in relativity when
F  &#x03BC;     {\displaystyle F^{\mu }}  [F^{\mu }] is the four-force,     m
{\displaystyle m}  [m] is the invariant_mass, and      A  &#x03BC;
{\displaystyle A^{\mu }}  [A^{\mu }] is the four-acceleration.[18]
***** Descriptions *****
Free_body_diagrams of a block on a flat surface and an inclined_plane. Forces
are resolved and added together to determine their magnitudes and the net
force.
Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive
understanding for describing forces.[2] As with other physical concepts (e.g.
temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise
operational_definitions that are consistent with direct observations and
compared_to_a_standard_measurement_scale. Through experimentation, it is
determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the
conceptual_definition of force offered by Newtonian_mechanics.
Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong
the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as
"vector_quantities". This means that forces follow a different set of
mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted
scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces
act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the
direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of
information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For
example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known
magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is
pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will
be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug_of_war or the
two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-
dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is
impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two
force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with
vectors avoids such problems.
Historically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of
static_equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such
experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector
quantities: they have magnitude and direction.[2] When two forces act on a
point_particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net_force),
can be determined by following the parallelogram_rule of vector_addition: the
addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an
equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the
transversal of the parallelogram.[3][4] The magnitude of the resultant varies
from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending
on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting
on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be
specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.
Free-body_diagrams can be used as a convenient way to keep track of forces
acting on a system. Ideally, these diagrams are drawn with the angles and
relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that graphical_vector
addition can be done to determine the net force.[19]
As well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components
at right_angles to each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can
therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east.
Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force.
Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis_vectors is often a
more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and
directions.[20] This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of
the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components
of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other
because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the
magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors
is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the
mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same
direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have
only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional
with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.[3][4]
**** Equilibrium ****
Equilibrium occurs when the resultant force acting on a point particle is zero
(that is, the vector sum of all forces is zero). When dealing with an extended
body, it is also necessary that the net torque be zero.
There are two kinds of equilibrium: static_equilibrium and dynamic_equilibrium.
*** Static ***
Main articles: Statics and Static_equilibrium
Static equilibrium was understood well before the invention of classical
mechanics. Objects that are at rest have zero net force acting on them.[21]
The simplest case of static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in
magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object on a level surface
is pulled (attracted) downward toward the center of the Earth by the force of
gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the
downward force with equal upward force (called a normal_force). The situation
produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.[2]
Pushing against an object that rests on a frictional surface can result in a
situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed
by static_friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a
situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the
applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or
decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by
the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.[2]
A static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring
forces, using simple devices such as weighing_scales and spring_balances. For
example, an object suspended on a vertical spring_scale experiences the force
of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the "spring
reaction force", which equals the object's weight. Using such tools, some
quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is
proportional to volume for objects of constant density (widely exploited for
millennia to define standard weights); Archimedes'_principle for buoyancy;
Archimedes' analysis of the lever; Boyle's_law for gas pressure; and Hooke's
law for springs. These were all formulated and experimentally verified before
Isaac Newton expounded his Three_Laws_of_Motion.[2][3][4]
*** Dynamic ***
Main article: Dynamics_(physics)
Galileo_Galilei was the first to point out the inherent contradictions
contained in Aristotle's description of forces.
Dynamic equilibrium was first described by Galileo who noticed that certain
assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and
logic. Galileo realized that simple_velocity_addition demands that the concept
of an "absolute rest_frame" did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a
constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to
Aristotle's notion of a "natural state" of rest that objects with mass
naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of
the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a
mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a
constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight
down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the
falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship.
However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always
falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the
ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal
force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is
that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it
falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant
forward velocity.[8]
Moreover, any object traveling at a constant velocity must be subject to zero
net force (resultant force). This is the definition of dynamic equilibrium:
when all the forces on an object balance but it still moves at a constant
velocity.
A simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across
a surface with kinetic_friction. In such a situation, a force is applied in the
direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the
applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started
with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity.
Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force.
However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that
there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.[3][4]
**** Forces in quantum mechanics ****
Main articles: Quantum_mechanics and Pauli_exclusion_principle
The notion "force" keeps its meaning in quantum_mechanics, though one is now
dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is
now described by the SchrÃ¶dinger_equation instead of Newtonian_equations. This
has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes
"quantized", i.e. they appear in discrete portions. This is, of course,
difficult to imagine in the context of "forces". However, the potentials V
(x,y,z) or fields, from which the forces generally can be derived, are treated
similarly to classical position variables, i.e.,     V ( x , y , z ) &#x2192;
V &#x005E;    (    x &#x005E;    ,    y &#x005E;    ,    z &#x005E;    )
{\displaystyle V(x,y,z)\to {\hat {V}}({\hat {x}},{\hat {y}},{\hat {z}})}  [V
(x,y,z)\to {\hat {V}}({\hat {x}},{\hat {y}},{\hat {z}})].
This becomes different only in the framework of quantum_field_theory, where
these fields are also quantized.
However, already in quantum mechanics there is one "caveat", namely the
particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but
also a discrete intrinsic angular_momentum-like variable called the "spin", and
there is the Pauli_exclusion_principle relating the space and the spin
variables. Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into
two different classes, fermions and bosons. If two identical fermions (e.g.
electrons) have a symmetric spin function (e.g. parallel spins) the spatial
variables must be antisymmetric (i.e. they exclude each other from their places
much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel
spins the position variables must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be
attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative
correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g.
quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.
Thus the notion "force" loses already part of its meaning.
**** Feynman diagrams ****
Main article: Feynman_diagrams
Feynman diagram for the decay of a neutron into a proton. The W_boson is
between two vertices indicating a repulsion.
In modern particle_physics, forces and the acceleration of particles are
explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge
bosons. With the development of quantum_field_theory and general_relativity, it
was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation_of
momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual_particles in quantum
electrodynamics). The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the
homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental
than the concept of a force. Thus the currently known fundamental_forces are
considered more accurately to be "fundamental_interactions".[5]:199â128 When
particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a
momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of
repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B. This
description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While
sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail,
the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to
describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman
diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world
line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in
the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their
direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles
intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force
arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated
instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines. Gauge bosons
are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual
particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex.[22]
The utility of Feynman diagrams is that other types of physical phenomena that
are part of the general picture of fundamental_interactions but are
conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules.
For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a neutron
decays into an electron, proton, and neutrino, an interaction mediated by the
same gauge boson that is responsible for the weak_nuclear_force.[22]
***** Fundamental forces *****
Main article: Fundamental_interaction
All of the known forces of the universe are classified into four fundamental
interactions. The strong and the weak forces are nuclear_forces that act only
at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between
subatomic_particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The
electromagnetic_force acts between electric_charges, and the gravitational
force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four
fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the
electromagnetic force acting between atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli
exclusion_principle,[23] which does not permit atoms to pass through each
other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's_law, are the result
of electromagnetic forces and the Pauli exclusion principle acting together to
return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal_forces are
acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames
of_reference.[3]:12-11[4]:359
The fundamental theories for forces developed from the unification of different
ideas. For example, Sir. Isaac_Newton unified, with his universal theory of
gravitation, the force responsible for objects falling near the surface of the
Earth with the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the
Earth (the Moon) and around the Sun (the planets). Michael_Faraday and James
Clerk_Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified
through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of
quantum_mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three
fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions)
interacting by exchanging virtual_particles called gauge_bosons.[24] This
standard_model of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and
led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic
forces in electroweak theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation.
The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved
Higgs_mechanism, but observations such as neutrino_oscillations suggest that
the standard model is incomplete. A Grand_Unified_Theory that allows for the
combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as
a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to
accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved_problems_in_physics. Physicists
are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would
combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory_of_everything. Einstein
tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to
answering this question is string_theory.[5]:212â219

**** Gravitational ****
Main article: Gravity
Images of a freely falling basketball taken with a stroboscope at 20 flashes
per second. The distance units on the right are multiples of about
12 millimeters. The basketball starts at rest. At the time of the first flash
(distance zero) it is released, after which the number of units fallen is equal
to the square of the number of flashes.
What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work
of Isaac Newton. Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the
Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects.
Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects
by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant
and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration_due_to
gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as         g
&#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {g}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec
{g}}] and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this
measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and
points toward the center of the Earth.[26] This observation means that the
force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional
to the object's mass. Thus an object that has a mass of     m   {\displaystyle
m}  [m] will experience a force:
            F &#x2192;    = m    g &#x2192;      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=m
      {\vec {g}}}  [{\vec {F}}=m{\vec {g}}]
For an object in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the
object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, the force of gravity is
opposed by the reaction forces applied by their supports. For example, a person
standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal_force (a
reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that
counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.[3][4]
Newton's contribution to gravitational theory was to unify the motions of
heavenly bodies, which Aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of
constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth. He proposed a law
of_gravity that could account for the celestial motions that had been described
earlier using Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion.[27]
Newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in
different ways at larger distances. In particular, Newton determined that the
acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force
of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse_square
law. Further, Newton realized that the acceleration of a body due to gravity is
proportional to the mass of the other attracting body.[27] Combining these
ideas gives a formula that relates the mass (      m  &#x2295;
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle m_{\oplus }}  [\scriptstyle m_{\oplus }]) and the
radius (      R  &#x2295;      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle R_{\oplus }}
[\scriptstyle R_{\oplus }]) of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration:
            g &#x2192;    = &#x2212;    G  m  &#x2295;       R  &#x2295;     2
      r &#x005E;      {\displaystyle {\vec {g}}=-{\frac {Gm_{\oplus }}{{R_
      {\oplus }}^{2}}}{\hat {r}}}  [{\vec {g}}=-{\frac {Gm_{\oplus }}{{R_
      {\oplus }}^{2}}}{\hat {r}}]
where the vector direction is given by        r &#x005E;      {\displaystyle
{\hat {r}}}  [{\hat {r}}], is the unit_vector directed outward from the center
of the Earth.[9]
In this equation, a dimensional constant     G   {\displaystyle G}  [G] is used
to describe the relative strength of gravity. This constant has come to be
known as Newton's_Universal_Gravitation_Constant,[28] though its value was
unknown in Newton's lifetime. Not until 1798 was Henry_Cavendish able to make
the first measurement of     G   {\displaystyle G}  [G] using a torsion
balance; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of
the Earth since knowing     G   {\displaystyle G}  [G] could allow one to solve
for the Earth's mass given the above equation. Newton, however, realized that
since all celestial bodies followed the same laws_of_motion, his law of gravity
had to be universal. Succinctly stated, Newton's_Law_of_Gravitation states that
the force on a spherical object of mass      m  1     {\displaystyle m_{1}}
[m_{1}] due to the gravitational pull of mass      m  2     {\displaystyle m_
{2}}  [m_{2}] is
            F &#x2192;    = &#x2212;    G  m  1    m  2     r  2        r
      &#x005E;      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=-{\frac {Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}
      {\hat {r}}}  [{\vec {F}}=-{\frac {Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}{\hat {r}}]
where     r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] is the distance between the two objects'
centers of mass and         r &#x005E;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\hat
{r}}}  [\scriptstyle {\hat {r}}] is the unit vector pointed in the direction
away from the center of the first object toward the center of the second
object.[9]
This formula was powerful enough to stand as the basis for all subsequent
descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century. During
that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation_analysis[29] were invented to
calculate the deviations of orbits due to the influence of multiple bodies on a
planet, moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact enough to allow
mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was
observed.[30]
Instruments like GRAVITY provide a powerful probe for gravity force detection.
[31]
Mercury's orbit, however, did not match that predicted by Newton's Law of
Gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet
(Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however no such planet could be
found. When Albert_Einstein formulated his theory of general_relativity (GR) he
turned his attention to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his
theory added a_correction,_which_could_account_for_the_discrepancy. This was
the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.
[32]
Since then, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best
explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather,
objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in
straight_lines through curved_space-time â defined as the shortest space-time
path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all
motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when
observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be
observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the
straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is
called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown
from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field.
Its space-time trajectory is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the
radius_of_curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of
the changing momentum of the object is what we label as "gravitational force".
[4]
**** Electromagnetic ****
Main article: Electromagnetic_force
The electrostatic_force was first described in 1784 by Coulomb as a force that
existed intrinsically between two charges.[16]:519 The properties of the
electrostatic force were that it varied as an inverse_square_law directed in
the radial_direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic
polarity), was independent of the mass of the charged objects, and followed the
superposition_principle. Coulomb's_law unifies all these observations into one
succinct statement.[33]
Subsequent mathematicians and physicists found the construct of the electric
field to be useful for determining the electrostatic force on an electric
charge at any point in space. The electric field was based on using a
hypothetical "test_charge" anywhere in space and then using Coulomb's Law to
determine the electrostatic force.[34]:4-6 to 4-8 Thus the electric field
anywhere in space is defined as
            E &#x2192;    =      F &#x2192;     q      {\displaystyle {\vec
      {E}}={{\vec {F}} \over {q}}}  [{\vec {E}}={{\vec {F}} \over {q}}]
where     q   {\displaystyle q}  [q] is the magnitude of the hypothetical test
charge.
Meanwhile, the Lorentz_force of magnetism was discovered to exist between two
electric_currents. It has the same mathematical character as Coulomb's Law with
the proviso that like currents attract and unlike currents repel. Similar to
the electric field, the magnetic_field can be used to determine the magnetic
force on an electric current at any point in space. In this case, the magnitude
of the magnetic field was determined to be
         B =   F  I &#x2113;      {\displaystyle B={F \over {I\ell }}}  [B={F
      \over {I\ell }}]
where     I   {\displaystyle I}  [I] is the magnitude of the hypothetical test
current and      &#x2113;    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \ell }  [\scriptstyle
\ell ] is the length of hypothetical wire through which the test current flows.
The magnetic field exerts a force on all magnets including, for example, those
used in compasses. The fact that the Earth's_magnetic_field is aligned closely
with the orientation of the Earth's axis causes compass magnets to become
oriented because of the magnetic force pulling on the needle.
Through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change
of electric charge, a rule of vector_multiplication called Lorentz's_Law
describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field.[34] The connection
between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified
electromagnetic force that acts on a charge. This force can be written as a sum
of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force
(due to the magnetic field). Fully stated, this is the law:
            F &#x2192;    = q (    E &#x2192;    +    v &#x2192;    &#x00D7;
      B &#x2192;    )   {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=q({\vec {E}}+{\vec {v}}\times
      {\vec {B}})}  [{\vec {F}}=q({\vec {E}}+{\vec {v}}\times {\vec {B}})]
where         F &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}}
[\scriptstyle {\vec {F}}] is the electromagnetic force,     q   {\displaystyle
q}  [q] is the magnitude of the charge of the particle,         E &#x2192;
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {E}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {E}}] is the
electric field,         v &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec
{v}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {v}}] is the velocity of the particle that is
crossed with the magnetic field (        B &#x2192;       {\displaystyle
\scriptstyle {\vec {B}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {B}}]).
The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until
1864 when James_Clerk_Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set
of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations
by Oliver_Heaviside and Josiah_Willard_Gibbs.[35] These "Maxwell_Equations"
fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving
charges, and the interactions of the fields themselves. This led Maxwell to
discover that electric and magnetic fields could be "self-generating" through a
wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed_of_light. This
insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led
directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic_spectrum.[36]
However, attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations,
the photoelectric_effect, and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet_catastrophe,
proved troublesome. Through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new
theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final
modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum
electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena
as being mediated by waveâparticles known as photons. In QED, photons are the
fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to
electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.[Note_4]
**** Strong nuclear ****
Main article: Strong_interaction
There are two "nuclear_forces", which today are usually described as
interactions that take place in quantum theories of particle physics. The
strong_nuclear_force[16]:940 is the force responsible for the structural
integrity of atomic_nuclei while the weak_nuclear_force[16]:951 is responsible
for the decay of certain nucleons into leptons and other types of hadrons.[3]
[4]
The strong force is today understood to represent the interactions between
quarks and gluons as detailed by the theory of quantum_chromodynamics (QCD).
[37] The strong force is the fundamental_force mediated by gluons, acting upon
quarks, antiquarks, and the gluons themselves. The (aptly named) strong
interaction is the "strongest" of the four fundamental forces.
The strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles. However, a
residual of the force is observed between hadrons (the best known example being
the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear_force.
Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part
of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force
(see this topic for more). The failure of many searches for free_quarks has
shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This
phenomenon is called color_confinement.
**** Weak nuclear ****
Main article: Weak_interaction
The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W_and_Z_bosons. Its most
familiar effect is beta_decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated
radioactivity. The word "weak" derives from the fact that the field strength is
some 1013 times less than that of the strong_force. Still, it is stronger than
gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been
developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are
indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins.
Such temperatures have been probed in modern particle_accelerators and show the
conditions of the universe in the early moments of the Big_Bang.
***** Non-fundamental forces *****
Some forces are consequences of the fundamental ones. In such situations,
idealized models can be utilized to gain physical insight.
**** Normal force ****
FN represents the normal_force exerted on the object.
Main article: Normal_force
The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at
close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to
fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a
direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.[16]:93 The
normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of
tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external
force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the
impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.[3][4]
**** Friction ****
Main article: Friction
Friction is a surface force that opposes relative motion. The frictional force
is directly related to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects
separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of
frictional forces: static_friction and kinetic_friction.
The static friction force (     F   s f      {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {sf} }}
[F_{\mathrm {sf} }]) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel
to a surface contact up to the limit specified by the coefficient_of_static
friction (     &#x03BC;   s f      {\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {sf} }}  [\mu _
{\mathrm {sf} }]) multiplied by the normal force (     F  N     {\displaystyle
F_{N}}  [F_{N}]). In other words, the magnitude of the static friction force
satisfies the inequality:
         0 &#x2264;  F   s f    &#x2264;  &#x03BC;   s f     F   N    .
      {\displaystyle 0\leq F_{\mathrm {sf} }\leq \mu _{\mathrm {sf} }F_{\mathrm
      {N} }.}  [0\leq F_{\mathrm {sf} }\leq \mu _{\mathrm {sf} }F_{\mathrm {N}
      }.]
The kinetic friction force (     F   k f      {\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {kf} }}
[F_{\mathrm {kf} }]) is independent of both the forces applied and the movement
of the object. Thus, the magnitude of the force equals:
          F   k f    =  &#x03BC;   k f     F   N    ,   {\displaystyle F_
      {\mathrm {kf} }=\mu _{\mathrm {kf} }F_{\mathrm {N} },}  [F_{\mathrm {kf}
      }=\mu _{\mathrm {kf} }F_{\mathrm {N} },]
where      &#x03BC;   k f      {\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {kf} }}  [\mu _
{\mathrm {kf} }] is the coefficient_of_kinetic_friction. For most surface
interfaces, the coefficient of kinetic friction is less than the coefficient of
static friction.
**** Tension ****
Main article: Tension_(physics)
Tension forces can be modeled using ideal_strings that are massless,
frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal
pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings
transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two
objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string
by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the
opposite direction by the second object.[38] By connecting the same string
multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable
pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that
acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the
load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase_in_force, there
is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in
order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the
conservation_of_mechanical_energy since the work_done_on_the_load is the same
no matter how complicated the machine.[3][4][39]
**** Elastic force ****
Main articles: Elasticity_(physics) and Hooke's_law
Fk is the force that responds to the load on the spring
An elastic force acts to return a spring to its natural length. An ideal_spring
is taken to be massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and infinitely stretchable.
Such springs exert forces that push when contracted, or pull when extended, in
proportion to the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position.[40]
This linear relationship was described by Robert_Hooke in 1676, for whom
Hooke's_law is named. If     &#x0394; x   {\displaystyle \Delta x}  [\Delta x]
is the displacement, the force exerted by an ideal spring equals:
            F &#x2192;    = &#x2212; k &#x0394;    x &#x2192;
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=-k\Delta {\vec {x}}}  [{\vec {F}}=-k\Delta
      {\vec {x}}]
where     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] is the spring constant (or force
constant), which is particular to the spring. The minus sign accounts for the
tendency of the force to act in opposition to the applied load.[3][4]
**** Continuum mechanics ****
When the drag force (     F  d     {\displaystyle F_{d}}  [F_{d}]) associated
with air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to the force of gravity on a
falling object (     F  g     {\displaystyle F_{g}}  [F_{g}]), the object
reaches a state of dynamic_equilibrium at terminal_velocity.
Main articles: Pressure, Drag_(physics), and Stress_(mechanics)
Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to
describe how forces affect idealized point_particles rather than three-
dimensional objects. However, in real life, matter has extended structure and
forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object.
For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to
flow, contract, expand, or otherwise change shape, the theories of continuum
mechanics describe the way forces affect the material. For example, in extended
fluids, differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the
pressure gradients as follows:
             F &#x2192;   V   = &#x2212;    &#x2207; &#x2192;    P
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\vec {F}}{V}}=-{\vec {\nabla }}P}  [{\frac {\vec
      {F}}{V}}=-{\vec {\nabla }}P]
where     V   {\displaystyle V}  [V] is the volume of the object in the fluid
and     P   {\displaystyle P}  [P] is the scalar_function that describes the
pressure at all locations in space. Pressure gradients and differentials result
in the buoyant_force for fluids suspended in gravitational fields, winds in
atmospheric_science, and the lift associated with aerodynamics and flight.[3]
[4]
A specific instance of such a force that is associated with dynamic_pressure is
fluid resistance: a body force that resists the motion of an object through a
fluid due to viscosity. For so-called "Stokes'_drag" the force is approximately
proportional to the velocity, but opposite in direction:
             F &#x2192;      d    = &#x2212; b    v &#x2192;
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{\mathrm {d} }=-b{\vec {v}}\,}  [{\vec {F}}_
      {\mathrm {d} }=-b{\vec {v}}\,]
where:
         b   {\displaystyle b}  [b] is a constant that depends on the
      properties of the fluid and the dimensions of the object (usually the
      cross-sectional_area), and
             v &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {v}}}
      [\scriptstyle {\vec {v}}] is the velocity of the object.[3][4]
More formally, forces in continuum_mechanics are fully described by a
stressâtensor with terms that are roughly defined as
         &#x03C3; =   F A     {\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {F}{A}}}  [\sigma =
      {\frac {F}{A}}]
where     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A] is the relevant cross-sectional area for
the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated. This formalism
includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-
sectional area (the matrix_diagonals of the tensor) as well as shear terms
associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area (the off-
diagonal elements). The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all
strains (deformations) including also tensile_stresses and compressions.[2][4]:
133â134[34]:38-1â38-11
**** Fictitious forces ****
Main article: Fictitious_forces
There are forces that are frame_dependent, meaning that they appear due to the
adoption of non-Newtonian (that is, non-inertial) reference_frames. Such forces
include the centrifugal_force and the Coriolis_force.[41] These forces are
considered fictitious because they do not exist in frames of reference that are
not accelerating.[3][4] Because these forces are not genuine they are also
referred to as "pseudo forces".[3]:12-11
In general_relativity, gravity becomes a fictitious force that arises in
situations where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry. As an extension,
KaluzaâKlein_theory and string_theory ascribe electromagnetism and the other
fundamental_forces respectively to the curvature of differently scaled
dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.
***** Rotations and torque *****
Relationship between force (F), torque (Ï), and momentum vectors (p and L) in
a rotating system.
Main article: Torque
Forces that cause extended objects to rotate are associated with torques.
Mathematically, the torque of a force         F &#x2192;       {\displaystyle
\scriptstyle {\vec {F}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {F}}] is defined relative to an
arbitrary reference point as the cross-product:
            &#x03C4; &#x2192;    =    r &#x2192;    &#x00D7;    F &#x2192;
      {\displaystyle {\vec {\tau }}={\vec {r}}\times {\vec {F}}}  [{\vec {\tau
      }}={\vec {r}}\times {\vec {F}}]
where
             r &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {r}}}
      [\scriptstyle {\vec {r}}] is the position_vector of the force application
      point relative to the reference point.
Torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the
rotational equivalent for position, angular_velocity for velocity, and angular
momentum for momentum. As a consequence of Newton's First Law of Motion, there
exists rotational_inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular
momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque. Likewise, Newton's Second
Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous
angular_acceleration of the rigid body:
            &#x03C4; &#x2192;    = I    &#x03B1; &#x2192;      {\displaystyle
      {\vec {\tau }}=I{\vec {\alpha }}}  [{\vec {\tau }}=I{\vec {\alpha }}]
where
         I   {\displaystyle I}  [I] is the moment_of_inertia of the body
             &#x03B1; &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {\alpha
      }}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {\alpha }}] is the angular acceleration of the
      body.
This provides a definition for the moment of inertia, which is the rotational
equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the
rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be
substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the
characteristics of rotations including precession and nutation.
Equivalently, the differential form of Newton's Second Law provides an
alternative definition of torque:
            &#x03C4; &#x2192;    =     d     L &#x2192;      d t    ,
      {\displaystyle {\vec {\tau }}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {L}}}{\mathrm
      {dt} }},}  [{\vec {\tau }}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {L}}}{\mathrm {dt}
      }},][42] where         L &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec
      {L}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {L}}] is the angular momentum of the particle.
Newton's Third Law of Motion requires that all objects exerting torques
themselves experience equal and opposite torques,[43] and therefore also
directly implies the conservation_of_angular_momentum for closed systems that
experience rotations and revolutions through the action of internal torques.
**** Centripetal force ****
Main article: Centripetal_force
For an object accelerating in circular motion, the unbalanced force acting on
the object equals:[44]
            F &#x2192;    = &#x2212;    m  v  2      r &#x005E;     r
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=-{\frac {mv^{2}{\hat {r}}}{r}}}  [{\vec {F}}=-
      {\frac {mv^{2}{\hat {r}}}{r}}]
where     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] is the mass of the object,     v
{\displaystyle v}  [v] is the velocity of the object and     r   {\displaystyle
r}  [r] is the distance to the center of the circular path and         r
&#x005E;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\hat {r}}}  [\scriptstyle {\hat
{r}}] is the unit_vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the
center. This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is
always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act
perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object,
and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the
velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force
that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is
perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields
both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it
down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its
direction.[3][4]
***** Kinematic integrals *****
Main articles: Impulse, Mechanical_work, and Power_(physics)
Forces can be used to define a number of physical concepts by integrating with
respect to kinematic_variables. For example, integrating with respect to time
gives the definition of impulse:[45]
            I &#x2192;    =  &#x222B;   t  1      t  2         F &#x2192;     d
      t  ,   {\displaystyle {\vec {I}}=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{{\vec {F}}\mathrm
      {d} t},}  [{\vec {I}}=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{{\vec {F}}\mathrm {d} t},]
which by Newton's Second Law must be equivalent to the change in momentum
(yielding the Impulse_momentum_theorem).
Similarly, integrating with respect to position gives a definition for the work
done by a force:[3]:13-3
         W =  &#x222B;      x &#x2192;     1         x &#x2192;     2         F
      &#x2192;    &#x22C5;   d     x &#x2192;      ,   {\displaystyle W=\int _{
      {\vec {x}}_{1}}^{{\vec {x}}_{2}}{{\vec {F}}\cdot {\mathrm {d} {\vec
      {x}}}},}  [W=\int _{{\vec {x}}_{1}}^{{\vec {x}}_{2}}{{\vec {F}}\cdot
      {\mathrm {d} {\vec {x}}}},]
which is equivalent to changes in kinetic_energy (yielding the work_energy
theorem).[3]:13-3
Power P is the rate of change dW/dt of the work W, as the trajectory is
extended by a position change       d     x &#x2192;       {\displaystyle
\scriptstyle {d}{\vec {x}}}  [\scriptstyle {d}{\vec {x}}] in a time interval
dt:[3]:13-2
          d  W  =      d  W    d     x &#x2192;        &#x22C5;   d     x
      &#x2192;     =     F &#x2192;     &#x22C5;   d     x &#x2192;    ,
      &#xA0;so&#xA0;   P  =      d  W    d  t     =      d  W    d     x
      &#x2192;        &#x22C5;      d     x &#x2192;       d  t     =     F
      &#x2192;     &#x22C5;     v &#x2192;    ,   {\displaystyle {\text
      {d}}W\,=\,{\frac {{\text{d}}W}{{\text{d}}{\vec {x}}}}\,\cdot \,{\text{d}}

      {\vec {F}}\,\cdot \,{\vec {v}},]
with         v &#x2192;     &#xA0;  =  &#xA0;d     x &#x2192;     /   d  t
{\displaystyle {{\vec {v}}{\text{ }}={\text{ d}}{\vec {x}}/{\text{d}}t}}  [{
{\vec {v}}{\text{ }}={\text{ d}}{\vec {x}}/{\text{d}}t}] the velocity.
***** Potential energy *****
Main article: Potential_energy
Instead of a force, often the mathematically related concept of a potential
energy field can be used for convenience. For instance, the gravitational force
acting upon an object can be seen as the action of the gravitational_field that
is present at the object's location. Restating mathematically the definition of
energy (via the definition of work), a potential scalar_field       U (    r
&#x2192;    )     {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {U({\vec {r}})}}  [\scriptstyle
{U({\vec {r}})}] is defined as that field whose gradient is equal and opposite
to the force produced at every point:
            F &#x2192;    = &#x2212;    &#x2207; &#x2192;    U .
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=-{\vec {\nabla }}U.}  [{\vec {F}}=-{\vec
      {\nabla }}U.]
Forces can be classified as conservative or nonconservative. Conservative
forces are equivalent to the gradient of a potential while nonconservative
forces are not.[3][4]
**** Conservative forces ****
Main article: Conservative_force
A conservative force that acts on a closed_system has an associated mechanical
work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms.
This means that for a closed system, the net mechanical_energy is conserved
whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is
related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different
locations in space,[46] and can be considered to be an artifact of the
potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of
water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour_map of the elevation
of an area.[3][4]
Conservative forces include gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the spring
force. Each of these forces has models that are dependent on a position often
given as a radial_vector         r &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle
{\vec {r}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {r}}] emanating from spherically_symmetric
potentials.[47] Examples of this follow:
For gravity:
             F &#x2192;     g   = &#x2212;    G  m  1    m  2     r  2        r
      &#x005E;      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{g}=-{\frac {Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}
      {\hat {r}}}  [{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{g}=-{\frac {Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}
      {\hat {r}}}]
where     G   {\displaystyle G}  [G] is the gravitational_constant, and      m
n     {\displaystyle m_{n}}  [m_{n}] is the mass of object n.
For electrostatic forces:
             F &#x2192;     e   =     q  1    q  2     4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;  0
      r  2         r &#x005E;      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{e}={\frac {q_
      {1}q_{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}r^{2}}}{\hat {r}}}  [{\displaystyle {\vec
      {F}}_{e}={\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}r^{2}}}{\hat {r}}}]
where      &#x03F5;  0     {\displaystyle \epsilon _{0}}  [\epsilon _{0}] is
electric_permittivity_of_free_space, and      q  n     {\displaystyle q_{n}}
[q_{n}] is the electric_charge of object n.
For spring forces:
             F &#x2192;     s   = &#x2212; k r    r &#x005E;
      {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{s}=-kr{\hat {r}}}  [{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_
      {s}=-kr{\hat {r}}}]
where     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] is the spring_constant.[3][4]
**** Nonconservative forces ****
For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due
to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations
that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of
microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous
electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that
is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other
than friction include other contact_forces, tension, compression, and drag.
However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the
results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net
results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.[3][4]
The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic
conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical
mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change
the internal_energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer
of heat. According to the Second_law_of_thermodynamics, nonconservative forces
necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered
to more random conditions as entropy increases.[3][4]
***** Units of measurement *****
The SI unit of force is the newton (symbol N), which is the force required to
accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared, or
kgÂ·mÂ·sâ2.[48] The corresponding CGS unit is the dyne, the force required to
accelerate a one gram mass by one centimeter per second squared, or
gÂ·cmÂ·sâ2. A newton is thus equal to 100,000 dynes.
The gravitational foot-pound-second English_unit of force is the pound-force
(lbf), defined as the force exerted by gravity on a pound-mass in the standard
gravitational field of 9.80665 mÂ·sâ2.[48] The pound-force provides an
alternative unit of mass: one slug is the mass that will accelerate by one foot
per second squared when acted on by one pound-force.[48]
An alternative unit of force in a different foot-pound-second system, the
absolute fps system, is the poundal, defined as the force required to
accelerate a one-pound mass at a rate of one foot per second squared.[48] The
units of slug and poundal are designed to avoid a constant of proportionality
in Newton's_Second_Law.
The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton:
the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard
gravity on one kilogram of mass.[48] The kilogram-force leads to an alternate,
but rarely used unit of mass: the metric_slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that
mass that accelerates at 1 mÂ·sâ2 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf. The
kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally
deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft
weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine
output torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthÃ¨ne, which is
equivalent to 1000 N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 lbf.

   2. ^ "It is important to note that we cannot derive a general expression for
      Newton's second law for variable mass systems by treating the mass in F =
      dP/dt = d(Mv) as a variable. [...] We can use F = dP/dt to analyze
      variable mass systems only if we apply it to an entire system of constant
      mass having parts among which there is an interchange of mass." [Emphasis

      Sun attracts Jupiter, and another by which Jupiter attracts the Sun; but
      it is one action by which the Sun and Jupiter mutually endeavour to come
