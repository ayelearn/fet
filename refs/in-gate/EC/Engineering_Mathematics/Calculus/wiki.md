Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of
infinitesimals", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same
way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of
generalizations of arithmetic_operations.
It has two major branches, differential_calculus and integral_calculus.
Differential calculus concerns instantaneous rates of change and the slopes of
curves. Integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities and the areas
under and between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the
fundamental_theorem_of_calculus. Both branches make use of the fundamental
notions of convergence of infinite_sequences and infinite_series to a well-
defined limit.[1]
Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by
Isaac_Newton and Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz.[2][3] Today, calculus has
widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.[4]
In mathematics_education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical
analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The
word calculus (plural calculi) is a Latin word, meaning originally "small
pebble" (this meaning is kept_in_medicine). Because such pebbles were used for
calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved for meaning method of
computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation
and related theories, such as propositional_calculus, Ricci_calculus, calculus
of_variations, lambda_calculus, and process_calculus.

***** History *****
Main article: History_of_calculus
Modern calculus was developed in 17th-century Europe by Isaac_Newton and
Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz (independently of each other, first publishing around
the same time) but elements of it appeared in ancient Greece, then in China and
the Middle East, and still later again in medieval Europe and in India.
**** Ancient ****
Archimedes used the method_of_exhaustion to calculate the area under a
parabola.
The ancient period introduced some of the ideas that led to integral calculus,
but does not seem to have developed these ideas in a rigorous and systematic
way. Calculations of volume and area, one goal of integral calculus, can be
found in the Egyptian Moscow_papyrus (13th_dynasty, c. 1820 BC), but the
formulas are simple instructions, with no indication as to method, and some of
them lack major components.[5]
From the age of Greek_mathematics, Eudoxus (c. 408â355 BC) used the method_of
exhaustion, which foreshadows the concept of the limit, to calculate areas and
volumes, while Archimedes (c. 287â212 BC) developed_this_idea_further,
inventing heuristics which resemble the methods of integral calculus.[6]
The method_of_exhaustion was later discovered independently in China by Liu_Hui
in the 3rd century AD in order to find the area of a circle.[7] In the 5th
century AD, Zu_Gengzhi, son of Zu_Chongzhi, established a method[8][9] that
would later be called Cavalieri's_principle to find the volume of a sphere.
**** Medieval ****
Alhazen, 11th century Arab mathematician and physicist
In the Middle East, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinized as Alhazen (c. 965 â
c. 1040 CE) derived a formula for the sum of fourth_powers. He used the results
to carry out what would now be called an integration of this function, where
the formulae for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to
calculate the volume of a paraboloid.[10]
In the 14th century, Indian mathematicians gave a non-rigorous method,
resembling differentiation, applicable to some trigonometric functions. Madhava
of_Sangamagrama and the Kerala_School_of_Astronomy_and_Mathematics thereby
stated components of calculus. A complete theory encompassing these components
is now well known in the Western world as the Taylor_series or infinite_series
approximations.[11] However, they were not able to "combine many differing
ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show
the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the great problem-
solving tool we have today".[10]
**** Modern ****
The calculus was the first achievement of modern mathematics and it is
difficult to overestimate its importance. I think it defines more unequivocally
than anything else the inception of modern mathematics, and the system of
mathematical analysis, which is its logical development, still constitutes the
greatest technical advance in exact thinking.
âJohn_von_Neumann[12]
In Europe, the foundational work was a treatise written by Bonaventura
Cavalieri, who argued that volumes and areas should be computed as the sums of
the volumes and areas of infinitesimally thin cross-sections. The ideas were
similar to Archimedes' in The_Method, but this treatise is believed to have
been lost in the 13th century, and was only rediscovered in the early 20th
century, and so would have been unknown to Cavalieri. Cavalieri's work was not
well respected since his methods could lead to erroneous results, and the
infinitesimal quantities he introduced were disreputable at first.
The formal study of calculus brought together Cavalieri's infinitesimals with
the calculus_of_finite_differences developed in Europe at around the same time.
Pierre_de_Fermat, claiming that he borrowed from Diophantus, introduced the
concept of adequality, which represented equality up to an infinitesimal error
term.[13] The combination was achieved by John_Wallis, Isaac_Barrow, and James
Gregory, the latter two proving the second_fundamental_theorem_of_calculus
around 1670.
Isaac_Newton developed the use of calculus in his laws_of_motion and
gravitation.
The product_rule and chain_rule,[14] the notions of higher_derivatives and
Taylor_series,[15] and of analytic_functions[citation_needed] were introduced
by Isaac_Newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of
mathematical_physics. In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the
mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by
equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used
the methods of calculus to solve the problem of planetary motion, the shape of
the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a
weight sliding on a cycloid, and many other problems discussed in his Principia
Mathematica (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for
functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was clear that he
understood the principles of the Taylor_series. He did not publish all these
discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered
disreputable.
Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz was the first to state clearly the rules of calculus.
These ideas were arranged into a true calculus of infinitesimals by Gottfried
Wilhelm_Leibniz, who was originally accused of plagiarism by Newton.[16] He is
now regarded as an independent_inventor of and contributor to calculus. His
contribution was to provide a clear set of rules for working with infinitesimal
quantities, allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives, and
providing the product_rule and chain_rule, in their differential and integral
forms. Unlike Newton, Leibniz paid a lot of attention to the formalism, often
spending days determining appropriate symbols for concepts.
Today, Leibniz and Newton are usually both given credit for independently
inventing and developing calculus. Newton was the first to apply calculus to
general physics and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus
today. The basic insights that both Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws
of differentiation and integration, second and higher derivatives, and the
notion of an approximating polynomial series. By Newton's time, the fundamental
theorem of calculus was known.
When Newton and Leibniz first published their results, there was great
controversy over which mathematician (and therefore which country) deserved
credit. Newton derived his results first (later to be published in his Method
of_Fluxions), but Leibniz published his "Nova_Methodus_pro_Maximis_et_Minimis"
first. Newton claimed Leibniz stole ideas from his unpublished notes, which
Newton had shared with a few members of the Royal_Society. This controversy
divided English-speaking mathematicians from continental European
mathematicians for many years, to the detriment of English mathematics.
[citation_needed] A careful examination of the papers of Leibniz and Newton
shows that they arrived at their results independently, with Leibniz starting
first with integration and Newton with differentiation. It is Leibniz, however,
who gave the new discipline its name. Newton called his calculus "the_science
of_fluxions".
Since the time of Leibniz and Newton, many mathematicians have contributed to
the continuing development of calculus. One of the first and most complete
works on both infinitesimal and integral_calculus was written in 1748 by Maria
Gaetana_Agnesi.[17][18]

**** Foundations ****
In calculus, foundations refers to the rigorous development of the subject from
axioms and definitions. In early calculus the use of infinitesimal quantities
was thought unrigorous, and was fiercely criticized by a number of authors,
most notably Michel_Rolle and Bishop_Berkeley. Berkeley famously described
infinitesimals as the ghosts_of_departed_quantities in his book The_Analyst in
1734. Working out a rigorous foundation for calculus occupied mathematicians
for much of the century following Newton and Leibniz, and is still to some
extent an active area of research today.
Several mathematicians, including Maclaurin, tried to prove the soundness of
using infinitesimals, but it would not be until 150 years later when, due to
the work of Cauchy and Weierstrass, a way was finally found to avoid mere
"notions" of infinitely small quantities.[19] The foundations of differential
and integral calculus had been laid. In Cauchy's Cours_d'Analyse, we find a
broad range of foundational approaches, including a definition of continuity in
terms of infinitesimals, and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an (Îµ,_Î´)-
definition_of_limit in the definition of differentiation.[20] In his work
Weierstrass formalized the concept of limit and eliminated infinitesimals
(although his definition can actually validate nilsquare infinitesimals).
Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus
on limits instead of infinitesimal quantities, though the subject is still
occasionally called "infinitesimal calculus". Bernhard_Riemann used these ideas
to give a precise definition of the integral. It was also during this period
that the ideas of calculus were generalized to Euclidean_space and the complex
plane.
In modern mathematics, the foundations of calculus are included in the field of
real_analysis, which contains full definitions and proofs of the theorems of
calculus. The reach of calculus has also been greatly extended. Henri_Lebesgue
invented measure_theory and used it to define integrals of all but the most
pathological functions. Laurent_Schwartz introduced distributions, which can be
used to take the derivative of any function whatsoever.
Limits are not the only rigorous approach to the foundation of calculus.
Another way is to use Abraham_Robinson's non-standard_analysis. Robinson's
approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery from mathematical
logic to augment the real number system with infinitesimal and infinite
numbers, as in the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers
are called hyperreal_numbers, and they can be used to give a Leibniz-like
development of the usual rules of calculus. There is also smooth_infinitesimal
analysis, which differs from non-standard analysis in that it mandates
neglecting higher power infinitesimals during derivations.
**** Significance ****
While many of the ideas of calculus had been developed earlier in Greece,
China, India, Iraq,_Persia, and Japan, the use of calculus began in Europe,
during the 17th century, when Isaac_Newton and Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz built
on the work of earlier mathematicians to introduce its basic principles. The
development of calculus was built on earlier concepts of instantaneous motion
and area underneath curves.
Applications of differential calculus include computations involving velocity
and acceleration, the slope of a curve, and optimization. Applications of
integral calculus include computations involving area, volume, arc_length,
center_of_mass, work, and pressure. More advanced applications include power
series and Fourier_series.
Calculus is also used to gain a more precise understanding of the nature of
space, time, and motion. For centuries, mathematicians and philosophers
wrestled with paradoxes involving division_by_zero or sums of infinitely many
numbers. These questions arise in the study of motion and area. The ancient
Greek philosopher Zeno_of_Elea gave several famous examples of such paradoxes.
Calculus provides tools, especially the limit and the infinite_series, that
resolve the paradoxes.
***** Principles *****
**** Limits and infinitesimals ****
Main articles: Limit_of_a_function and Infinitesimal
Calculus is usually developed by working with very small quantities.
Historically, the first method of doing so was by infinitesimals. These are
objects which can be treated like real numbers but which are, in some sense,
"infinitely small". For example, an infinitesimal number could be greater than
0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and thus less than
any positive real_number. From this point of view, calculus is a collection of
techniques for manipulating infinitesimals. The symbols    d x   {\displaystyle
dx}  [dx] and     d y   {\displaystyle dy}  [dy] were taken to be
infinitesimal, and the derivative     d y  /  d x   {\displaystyle dy/dx}  [dy/
dx] was simply their ratio.
The infinitesimal approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was
difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. However, the concept
was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of non-standard_analysis
and smooth_infinitesimal_analysis, which provided solid foundations for the
manipulation of infinitesimals.
In the late 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced within academia by the
epsilon,_delta approach to limits. Limits describe the value of a function at a
certain input in terms of its values at nearby inputs. They capture small-scale
behavior in the context of the real_number_system. In this treatment, calculus
is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals
get replaced by very small numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of the
function is found by taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller
numbers. Limits were thought to provide a more rigorous foundation for
calculus, and for this reason they became the standard approach during the
twentieth century.
**** Differential calculus ****
Main article: Differential_calculus
Tangent line at (x, f(x)). The derivative fâ²(x) of a curve at a point is the
slope (rise over run) of the line tangent to that curve at that point.
Differential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and
applications of the derivative of a function. The process of finding the
derivative is called differentiation. Given a function and a point in the
domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale
behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a
function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new
function, called the derivative function or just the derivative of the original
function. In formal terms, the derivative is a linear_operator which takes a
function as its input and produces a second function as its output. This is
more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where
functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the
doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the
squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The
derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means
that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring functionâsuch
as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen,
and so onâand uses this information to produce another function. The function
produced by deriving the squaring function turns out to be the doubling
function.
In more explicit terms the "doubling function" may be denoted by g(x) = 2x and
the "squaring function" by f(x) = x2. The "derivative" now takes the function f
(x), defined by the expression "x2", as an input, that is all the
informationâsuch as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is
sent to sixteen, and so onâand uses this information to output another
function, the function g(x) = 2x, as will turn out.
The most common symbol for a derivative is an apostrophe-like mark called
prime. Thus, the derivative of a function called f is denoted by fâ²,
pronounced "f prime". For instance, if f(x) = x2 is the squaring function, then
fâ²(x) = 2x is its derivative (the doubling function g from above). This
notation is known as Lagrange's_notation.
If the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents
change with respect to time. For example, if f is a function that takes a time
as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the
derivative of f is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the
velocity of the ball.
If a function is linear (that is, if the graph of the function is a straight
line), then the function can be written as y = mx + b, where x is the
independent variable, y is the dependent variable, b is the y-intercept, and:
         m =   rise run   =     change in&#xA0;  y    change in&#xA0;  x    =
      &#x0394; y   &#x0394; x    .   {\displaystyle m={\frac {\text{rise}}
      {\text{run}}}={\frac {{\text{change in }}y}{{\text{change in }}x}}={\frac
      {\Delta y}{\Delta x}}.}  [m= \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}= \frac{\text
      {change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.]
This gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line. If the graph of the
function is not a straight line, however, then the change in y divided by the
change in x varies. Derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change
in output with respect to change in input. To be concrete, let f be a function,
and fix a point a in the domain of f. (a, f(a)) is a point on the graph of the
function. If h is a number close to zero, then a + h is a number close to a.
Therefore, (a + h, f(a + h)) is close to (a, f(a)). The slope between these two
points is
         m =    f ( a + h ) &#x2212; f ( a )   ( a + h ) &#x2212; a    =    f
      ( a + h ) &#x2212; f ( a )  h   .   {\displaystyle m={\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}
      {(a+h)-a}}={\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}.}  [m = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{(a+h) -
      a} = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.]
This expression is called a difference_quotient. A line through two points on a
curve is called a secant line, so m is the slope of the secant line between (a,
f(a)) and (a + h, f(a + h)). The secant line is only an approximation to the
behavior of the function at the point a because it does not account for what
happens between a and a + h. It is not possible to discover the behavior at a
by setting h to zero because this would require dividing_by_zero, which is
undefined. The derivative is defined by taking the limit as h tends to zero,
meaning that it considers the behavior of f for all small values of h and
extracts a consistent value for the case when h equals zero:
          lim  h &#x2192; 0      f ( a + h ) &#x2212; f ( a )   h    .
      {\displaystyle \lim _{h\to 0}{f(a+h)-f(a) \over {h}}.}  [\lim_{h \to 0}{f
      (a+h) - f(a)\over{h}}.]
Geometrically, the derivative is the slope of the tangent_line to the graph of
f at a. The tangent line is a limit of secant lines just as the derivative is a
limit of difference quotients. For this reason, the derivative is sometimes
called the slope of the function f.
Here is a particular example, the derivative of the squaring function at the
input 3. Let f(x) = x2 be the squaring function.
The derivative fâ²(x) of a curve at a point is the slope of the line tangent
to that curve at that point. This slope is determined by considering the
limiting value of the slopes of secant lines. Here the function involved (drawn
in red) is f(x) = x3 â x. The tangent line (in green) which passes through
the point (â3/2, â15/8) has a slope of 23/4. Note that the vertical and
horizontal scales in this image are different.
              f &#x2032;  ( 3 )    =  lim  h &#x2192; 0      ( 3 + h  )  2
      &#x2212;  3  2     h          =  lim  h &#x2192; 0      9 + 6 h +  h  2
      &#x2212; 9   h          =  lim  h &#x2192; 0      6 h +  h  2     h
      =  lim  h &#x2192; 0   ( 6 + h )       = 6       {\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}f'(3)&=\lim _{h\to 0}{(3+h)^{2}-3^{2} \over {h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to
      0}{9+6h+h^{2}-9 \over {h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}{6h+h^{2} \over {h}}\\&=\lim
      _{h\to 0}(6+h)\\&=6\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f'
      (3)&=\lim _{h\to 0}{(3+h)^{2}-3^{2} \over {h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}{9+6h+h^
      {2}-9 \over {h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}{6h+h^{2} \over {h}}\\&=\lim _{h\to 0}
      (6+h)\\&=6\end{aligned}}}]
The slope of the tangent line to the squaring function at the point (3, 9) is
6, that is to say, it is going up six times as fast as it is going to the
right. The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the
domain of the squaring function. This defines the derivative function of the
squaring function, or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. A
computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring
function is the doubling function.
**** Leibniz notation ****
Main article: Leibniz's_notation
A common notation, introduced by Leibniz, for the derivative in the example
above is
             y    =  x  2          d y   d x       = 2 x .       {\displaystyle
      {\begin{aligned}y&=x^{2}\\{\frac {dy}{dx}}&=2x.\end{aligned}}}  [
      \begin{align}
      y&=x^2 \\
      \frac{dy}{dx}&=2x.
      \end{align}
      ]
In an approach based on limits, the symbol dy/dx is to be interpreted not as
the quotient of two numbers but as a shorthand for the limit computed above.
Leibniz, however, did intend it to represent the quotient of two
infinitesimally small numbers, dy being the infinitesimally small change in y
caused by an infinitesimally small change dx applied to x. We can also think of
d/dx as a differentiation operator, which takes a function as an input and
gives another function, the derivative, as the output. For example:
           d  d x    (  x  2   ) = 2 x .   {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}(x^
      {2})=2x.}  [
      \frac{d}{dx}(x^2)=2x.
      ]
In this usage, the dx in the denominator is read as "with respect to x".
Another example of correct notation could be:
       g ( t ) =  t  2   + 2 t + 4          d  d t    g ( t ) = 2 t + 2
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}g(t)=t^{2}+2t+4\\\\{d \over dt}g(t)=2t+2\end
{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}g(t)=t^{2}+2t+4\\\\{d \over dt}g
(t)=2t+2\end{aligned}}}]
Even when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals, it is
common to manipulate symbols like dx and dy as if they were real numbers;
although it is possible to avoid such manipulations, they are sometimes
notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the total_derivative.
**** Integral calculus ****
Main article: Integral
Integral calculus is the study of the definitions, properties, and applications
of two related concepts, the indefinite integral and the definite integral. The
process of finding the value of an integral is called integration. In technical
language, integral calculus studies two related linear_operators.
The indefinite integral, also known as the antiderivative, is the inverse
operation to the derivative. F is an indefinite integral of f when f is a
derivative of F. (This use of lower- and upper-case letters for a function and
its indefinite integral is common in calculus.)
The definite integral inputs a function and outputs a number, which gives the
algebraic sum of areas between the graph of the input and the x-axis. The
technical definition of the definite integral involves the limit of a sum of
areas of rectangles, called a Riemann_sum.
A motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time.
          D i s t a n c e  =  S p e e d  &#x22C5;  T i m e    {\displaystyle
      \mathrm {Distance} =\mathrm {Speed} \cdot \mathrm {Time} }  [\mathrm
      {Distance} = \mathrm{Speed} \cdot \mathrm{Time}]
If the speed is constant, only multiplication is needed, but if the speed
changes, a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary. One such
method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into
many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each
interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a
Riemann_sum) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic
idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or
less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the
distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the
exact distance traveled.
Constant velocity
Integration can be thought of as measuring the area under a curve, defined by f
(x), between two points (here a and b).
When velocity is constant, the total distance traveled over the given time
interval can be computed by multiplying velocity and time. For example,
travelling a steady 50 mph for 3 hours results in a total distance of 150
miles. In the diagram on the left, when constant velocity and time are graphed,
these two values form a rectangle with height equal to the velocity and width
equal to the time elapsed. Therefore, the product of velocity and time also
calculates the rectangular area under the (constant) velocity curve. This
connection between the area under a curve and distance traveled can be extended
to any irregularly shaped region exhibiting a fluctuating velocity over a given
time period. If f(x) in the diagram on the right represents speed as it varies
over time, the distance traveled (between the times represented by a and b) is
the area of the shaded region s.
To approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the
distance between a and b into a number of equal segments, the length of each
segment represented by the symbol Îx. For each small segment, we can choose
one value of the function f(x). Call that value h. Then the area of the
rectangle with base Îx and height h gives the distance (time Îx multiplied by
speed h) traveled in that segment. Associated with each segment is the average
value of the function above it, f(x) = h. The sum of all such rectangles gives
an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve, which is an
approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller value for Îx will give
more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation, but for an exact
answer we need to take a limit as Îx approaches zero.
The symbol of integration is     &#x222B;   {\displaystyle \int }  [\int ], an
elongated_S (the S stands for "sum"). The definite integral is written as:
          &#x222B;  a   b   f ( x )  d x .   {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f
      (x)\,dx.}  [\int_a^b f(x)\, dx.]
and is read "the integral from a to b of f-of-x with respect to x." The Leibniz
notation dx is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an
infinite number of rectangles, so that their width Îx becomes the
infinitesimally small dx. In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the
notation
          &#x222B;  a   b   &#x22EF;  d x   {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}\cdots
      \,dx}  [\int_a^b \cdots\, dx]
is to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives
a number, the area, as an output. The terminating differential, dx, is not a
number, and is not being multiplied by f(x), although, serving as a reminder of
the Îx limit definition, it can be treated as such in symbolic manipulations
of the integral. Formally, the differential indicates the variable over which
the function is integrated and serves as a closing bracket for the integration
operator.
The indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:
         &#x222B; f ( x )  d x .   {\displaystyle \int f(x)\,dx.}  [\int f(x)\,
      dx.]
Functions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be
shown that the antiderivative of a given function is actually a family of
functions differing only by a constant. Since the derivative of the function y
= x2 + C, where C is any constant, is yâ² = 2x, the antiderivative of the
latter given by:
         &#x222B; 2 x  d x =  x  2   + C .   {\displaystyle \int 2x\,dx=x^
      {2}+C.}  [\int 2x\, dx = x^2 + C.]
The unspecified constant C present in the indefinite integral or antiderivative
is known as the constant_of_integration.
**** Fundamental theorem ****
Main article: Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus
The fundamental_theorem_of_calculus states that differentiation and integration
are inverse operations. More precisely, it relates the values of
antiderivatives to definite integrals. Because it is usually easier to compute
an antiderivative than to apply the definition of a definite integral, the
fundamental theorem of calculus provides a practical way of computing definite
integrals. It can also be interpreted as a precise statement of the fact that
differentiation is the inverse of integration.
The fundamental theorem of calculus states: If a function f is continuous on
the interval [a, b] and if F is a function whose derivative is f on the
interval (a, b), then
          &#x222B;  a   b   f ( x )  d x = F ( b ) &#x2212; F ( a ) .
      {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=F(b)-F(a).}  [\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx
      = F(b) - F(a).]
Furthermore, for every x in the interval (a, b),
           d  d x     &#x222B;  a   x   f ( t )  d t = f ( x ) .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\,dt=f(x).}  [\frac{d}
      {dx}\int_a^x f(t)\, dt = f(x).]
This realization, made by both Newton and Leibniz, who based their results on
earlier work by Isaac_Barrow, was key to the proliferation of analytic results
after their work became known. The fundamental theorem provides an algebraic
method of computing many definite integralsâwithout performing limit
processesâby finding formulas for antiderivatives. It is also a prototype
solution of a differential_equation. Differential equations relate an unknown
function to its derivatives, and are ubiquitous in the sciences.
***** Applications *****
The logarithmic_spiral of the Nautilus_shell is a classical image used to
depict the growth and change related to calculus.
Calculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences, actuarial_science,
computer_science, statistics, engineering, economics, business, medicine,
demography, and in other fields wherever a problem can be mathematically
modeled and an optimal solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-
constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in
studying a problem we know one and are trying to find the other.
Physics makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in classical_mechanics
and electromagnetism are related through calculus. The mass of an object of
known density, the moment_of_inertia of objects, as well as the total energy of
an object within a conservative field can be found by the use of calculus. An
example of the use of calculus in mechanics is Newton's_second_law_of_motion:
historically stated it expressly uses the term "change of motion" which implies
the derivative saying The change of momentum of a body is equal to the
resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction. Commonly
expressed today as Force = Mass Ã acceleration, it implies differential
calculus because acceleration is the time derivative of velocity or second time
derivative of trajectory or spatial position. Starting from knowing how an
object is accelerating, we use calculus to derive its path.
Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism and Einstein's theory of general
relativity are also expressed in the language of differential calculus.
Chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates and radioactive
decay. In biology, population dynamics starts with reproduction and death rates
to model population changes.
Calculus can be used in conjunction with other mathematical disciplines. For
example, it can be used with linear_algebra to find the "best fit" linear
approximation for a set of points in a domain. Or it can be used in probability
theory to determine the probability of a continuous random variable from an
assumed density function. In analytic_geometry, the study of graphs of
functions, calculus is used to find high points and low points (maxima and
minima), slope, concavity and inflection_points.
Green's_Theorem, which gives the relationship between a line integral around a
simple closed curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by
C, is applied in an instrument known as a planimeter, which is used to
calculate the area of a flat surface on a drawing. For example, it can be used
to calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or
swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property.
Discrete_Green's_Theorem, which gives the relationship between a double
integral of a function around a simple closed rectangular curve C and a linear
combination of the antiderivative's values at corner points along the edge of
the curve, allows fast calculation of sums of values in rectangular domains.
For example, it can be used to efficiently calculate sums of rectangular
domains in images, in order to rapidly extract features and detect object;
another algorithm that could be used is the summed_area_table.
In the realm of medicine, calculus can be used to find the optimal branching
angle of a blood vessel so as to maximize flow. From the decay laws for a
particular drug's elimination from the body, it is used to derive dosing laws.
In nuclear medicine, it is used to build models of radiation transport in
targeted tumor therapies.
In economics, calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by
providing a way to easily calculate both marginal_cost and marginal_revenue.
Calculus is also used to find approximate solutions to equations; in practice
it is the standard way to solve differential equations and do root finding in
most applications. Examples are methods such as Newton's_method, fixed_point
iteration, and linear_approximation. For instance, spacecraft use a variation
of the Euler_method to approximate curved courses within zero gravity
environments.
***** Varieties *****
Over the years, many reformulations of calculus have been investigated for
different purposes.
**** Non-standard calculus ****
Main article: Non-standard_calculus
Imprecise calculations with infinitesimals were widely replaced with the
rigorous (Îµ,_Î´)-definition_of_limit starting in the 1870s. Meanwhile,
calculations with infinitesimals persisted and often led to correct results.
This led Abraham_Robinson to investigate if it were possible to develop a
number system with infinitesimal quantities over which the theorems of calculus
were still valid. In 1960, building upon the work of Edwin_Hewitt and Jerzy
ÅoÅ, he succeeded in developing non-standard_analysis. The theory of non-
standard analysis is rich enough to be applied in many branches of mathematics.
As such, books and articles dedicated solely to the traditional theorems of
calculus often go by the title non-standard_calculus.
**** Smooth infinitesimal analysis ****
Main article: Smooth_infinitesimal_analysis
This is another reformulation of the calculus in terms of infinitesimals. Based
on the ideas of F._W._Lawvere and employing the methods of category_theory, it
views all functions as being continuous and incapable of being expressed in
terms of discrete entities. One aspect of this formulation is that the law_of
excluded_middle does not hold in this formulation.
**** Constructive analysis ****
Main article: Constructive_analysis
Constructive_mathematics is a branch of mathematics that insists that proofs of
the existence of a number, function, or other mathematical object should give a
construction of the object. As such constructive mathematics also rejects the
law_of_excluded_middle. Reformulations of calculus in a constructive framework
are generally part of the subject of constructive_analysis.

      century were optimistic and anxious for quick results; consequently they
      left the foundations of analytical geometry and the infinitesimal
      calculus insecure. Leibniz believed in actual infinitesimals, but
      although this belief suited his metaphysics it had no sound basis in
      mathematics. Weierstrass, soon after the middle of the nineteenth
      century, showed how to establish the calculus without infinitesimals, and
      thus at last made it logically secure. Next came Georg Cantor, who
      developed the theory of continuity and infinite number. "Continuity" had
      been, until he defined it, a vague word, convenient for philosophers like
      Hegel, who wished to introduce metaphysical muddles into mathematics.
      Cantor gave a precise significance to the word, and showed that
      continuity, as he defined it, was the concept needed by mathematicians
      and physicists. By this means a great deal of mysticism, such as that of
      Bergson, was rendered antiquated.
