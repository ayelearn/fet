Feedback exists between two parts when each affects the other.[1](p53)
A feedback loop where all outputs of a process are available as causal inputs
to that process
Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a
chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop.[2] The system can then
be said to feed back into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be
handled carefully when applied to feedback systems:
     Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because
     the first system influences the second and second system influences
     the first, leading to a circular argument. This makes reasoning based
     upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the
     system as a whole.

***** History[edit] *****
Self-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and the idea of
feedback had started to enter economic theory in Britain by the eighteenth
century, but it wasn't at that time recognized as a universal abstraction and
so didn't have a name.[4]
One of the first ever artificial feedback device, was a mercury thermostat to
regulate the temperature of a chicken incubator in 1620 in England by Cornelis
Drebbel, based on similar principle of measuring temperature to thermoscope
possibly invented by Galileo_Galilei 1593.
Centrifugal_governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between
millstones in windmills since the 17th century.
In 1788 James_Watt designed his first Centrifugal_governor following a
suggestion from his business partner Matthew_Boulton, for use in the steam
engines of their production. Early steam_engines employed a purely
reciprocating motion, and were used for pumping water â an application that
could tolerate variations in the working speed, but the use of steam engines
for other applications called for more precise control of the speed.
In 1868, James_Clerk_Maxwell wrote a famous paper "On governors" that is widely
considered a classic in feedback control theory.[5]. This was a landmark paper
on control_theory and mathematics of feedback.
The verb phrase "to feed back", in the sense of returning to an earlier
position in a mechanical process, was in use in the US by the 1860s,[6][7] and
in 1909, Nobel laureate Karl_Ferdinand_Braun used the term "feed-back" as a
noun to refer to (undesired) coupling between components of an electronic
circuit.[8]
By the end of 1912, researchers using early electronic amplifiers (audions) had
discovered that deliberately coupling part of the output signal back to the
input circuit would boost the amplification (through regeneration), but would
also cause the audion to howl or sing.[9] This action of feeding back of the
signal from output to input gave rise to the use of the term "feedback" as a
distinct word by 1920.[9]
Over the years there has been some dispute as to the best definition of
feedback. According to Ashby (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in
the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of circularity of
action, which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more
practical aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible
connection.
     [Practical experimenters] object to the mathematician's definition,
     pointing out that this would force them to say that feedback was
     present in the ordinary pendulum ... between its position and its
     momentumâa "feedback" that, from the practical point of view, is
     somewhat mystical. To this the mathematician retorts that if feedback
     is to be considered present only when there is an actual wire or
     nerve to represent it, then the theory becomes chaotic and riddled
     with irrelevancies.[1](p54)
Focusing on uses in management theory, Ramaprasad (1983) defines feedback
generally as "...information about the gap between the actual level and the
reference level of a system parameter" that is used to "alter the gap in some
way". He emphasizes that the information by itself is not feedback unless
translated into action.[10]
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Positive and negative feedback[edit] ****
Main articles: Negative_feedback and Positive_feedback
Maintaining a desired system performance despite disturbance using negative
feedback to reduce system error
An example of a negative feedback loop with goals
There are two types of feedback: positive_feedback and negative_feedback.
A positive feedback loop example
As an example of negative feedback, the diagram might represent a cruise
control system in a car, for example, that matches a target speed such as the
speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined
torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the
disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. The error
signal is the departure of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the
target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller
to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the
effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with
the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed,
minimizing the road disturbance.
The terms "positive" and "negative" were first applied to feedback prior to
WWII. The idea of positive feedback was already current in the 1920s with the
introduction of the regenerative_circuit.[11] Friis and Jensen (1924) described
regeneration in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where the "feed-back"
action is positive in contrast to negative feed-back action, which they mention
only in passing.[12] Harold_Stephen_Black's classic 1934 paper first details
the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers. According to Black:
     Positive feed-back increases the gain of the amplifier, negative
     feed-back reduces it.[13]
According to Mindell (2002) confusion in the terms arose shortly after this:
     ...Friis and Jensen had made the same distinction Black used between
     "positive feed-back" and "negative feed-back", based not on the sign
     of the feedback itself but rather on its effect on the amplifier's
     gain. In contrast, Nyquist and Bode, when they built on Black's work,
     referred to negative feedback as that with the sign reversed. Black
     had trouble convincing others of the utility of his invention in part
     because confusion existed over basic matters of definition.[11](p121)
Even prior to the terms being applied, James_Clerk_Maxwell had described
several kinds of "component motions" associated with the centrifugal_governors
used in steam engines, distinguishing between those that lead to a continual
increase in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation, and those that
lead to a decrease of the same.[14]
*** Terminology[edit] ***
The terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within
different disciplines.
   1. the altering of the gap between reference and actual values of a
      parameter, based on whether the gap is widening (positive) or narrowing
      (negative).[10]
   2. the valence of the action or effect that alters the gap, based on whether
      it has a happy (positive) or unhappy (negative) emotional connotation to
      the recipient or observer.[15]
The two definitions may cause confusion, such as when an incentive (reward) is
used to boost poor performance (narrow a gap). Referring to definition 1, some
authors use alternative terms, replacing positive/negative with self-
reinforcing/self-correcting,[16] reinforcing/balancing,[17] discrepancy-
enhancing/discrepancy-reducing[18] or regenerative/degenerative[19]
respectively. And for definition 2, some authors advocate describing the action
or effect as positive/negative reinforcement or punishment rather than
feedback.[10][20] Yet even within a single discipline an example of feedback
can be called either positive or negative, depending on how values are measured
or referenced.[21]
This confusion may arise because feedback can be used for either informational
or motivational purposes, and often has both a qualitative and a quantitative
component. As Connellan and Zemke (1993) put it:
     Quantitative feedback tells us how much and how many. Qualitative
     feedback tells us how good, bad or indifferent.[22](p102)
*** Limitations of negative and positive feedback[edit] ***
While simple systems can sometimes be described as one or the other type, many
systems with feedback loops cannot be so easily designated as simply positive
or negative, and this is especially true when multiple loops are present.
     When there are only two parts joined so that each affects the other,
     the properties of the feedback give important and useful information
     about the properties of the whole. But when the parts rise to even as
     few as four, if every one affects the other three, then twenty
     circuits can be traced through them; and knowing the properties of
     all the twenty circuits does not give complete information about the
     system.[1](p54)
**** Other types of feedback[edit] ****
In general, feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback
loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where
positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or
different points in the state space of a system.
The term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where
positive and negative feedback systems can interact, the output of one
affecting the input of another, and vice versa.[23]
Some systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as chaotic
behaviors in non-linear systems, while others have much more predictable
behaviors, such as those that are used to make and design digital systems.
Feedback is used extensively in digital systems. For example, binary counters
and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used
to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the
device to update it.
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Mathematics and Dynamical systems[edit] ****
Feedback can give rise to incredibly complex behaviors. The Mandelbrot_set
(black) within a continuously colored environment is plotted by repeatedly
feeding back values through a simple equation and recording the points on the
imaginary plane that fail to diverge
Main articles: Dynamical_system, Chaos_theory, Edge_of_chaos, and Control
theory
By using feedback properties, the behavior of a system can be altered to meet
the needs of an application; systems can be made stable, responsive or held
constant. It is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an
adaptation to the edge_of_chaos.[24]
**** Biology[edit] ****
See also: Homeostasis and Allostasis
In biological systems such as organisms, ecosystems, or the biosphere, most
parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain
optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the
optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in
internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental
conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to
function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception
system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An
example of this is insulin_oscillations.
Biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, both positive and
negative. As in other contexts, positive and negative do not imply that the
feedback causes good or bad effects. A negative feedback loop is one that tends
to slow down a process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate
it. The mirror_neurons are part of a social feedback system, when an observed
action is "mirrored" by the brainâlike a self-performed action.
Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse
cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as
mediators; failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue
function.[25] In an injured or infected tissue, inflammatory mediators elicit
feedback responses in cells, which alter gene expression, and change the groups
of molecules expressed and secreted, including molecules that induce diverse
cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function. This type of
feedback is important because it enables coordination of immune responses and
recovery from infections and injuries. During cancer, key elements of this
feedback fail. This disrupts tissue function and immunity.[26][27]
Mechanisms of feedback were first elucidated in bacteria, where a nutrient
elicits changes in some of their metabolic functions.[28] Feedback is also
central to the operations of genes and gene_regulatory_networks. Repressor (see
Lac_repressor) and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons, which
were identified by Francois_Jacob and Jacques_Monod in 1961 as feedback loops.
[29] These feedback loops may be positive (as in the case of the coupling
between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial
cell), or negative (as is often the case in metabolic consumption).
On a larger scale, feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations
even when profoundly affected by external changes, although time lags in
feedback response can give rise to predator-prey_cycles.[30]
In zymology, feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its
direct product(s) or downstream metabolite(s) in the metabolic pathway (see
Allosteric_regulation).
The hypothalamicâpituitaryâadrenal_axis is largely controlled by positive
and negative feedback, much of which is still unknown.
In psychology, the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally
that causes the release of hormones. Release of hormones then may cause more of
those hormones to be released, causing a positive feedback loop. This cycle is
also found in certain behaviour. For example, "shame loops" occur in people who
blush easily. When they realize that they are blushing, they become even more
embarrassed, which leads to further blushing, and so on.[31]
**** Climate science[edit] ****
Main article: Climate_change_feedback
The climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback
loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere, ocean, and
land. A simple example is the ice-albedo_positive_feedback loop whereby melting
snow exposes more dark ground (of lower albedo), which in turn absorbs heat and
causes more snow to melt.
**** Control theory[edit] ****
Main article: Control_theory
Feedback is extensively used in control theory, using a variety of methods
including state_space_(controls), full_state_feedback, and so forth. Note that
in the context of control theory, "feedback" is traditionally assumed to
specify "negative feedback".[32]
Further information: PID_controller
The most common general-purpose controller using a control-loop feedback
mechanism is a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.
Heuristically, the terms of a PID controller can be interpreted as
corresponding to time: the proportional term depends on the present error, the
integral term on the accumulation of past errors, and the derivative term is a
prediction of future error, based on current rate of change.[33]
**** Mechanical engineering[edit] ****
In ancient times, the float_valve was used to regulate the flow of water in
Greek and Roman water_clocks; similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in
a carburettor and also used to regulate tank water level in the flush_toilet.
The Dutch inventor Cornelius_Drebbel (1572-1633) built thermostats (c1620) to
control the temperature of chicken incubators and chemical furnaces. In 1745,
the windmill was improved by blacksmith Edmund Lee, who added a fantail to keep
the face of the windmill pointing into the wind. In 1787, Tom_Mead regulated
the rotation speed of a windmill by using a centrifugal_pendulum to adjust the
distance between the bedstone and the runner stone (i.e., to adjust the load).
The use of the centrifugal_governor by James_Watt in 1788 to regulate the speed
of his steam_engine was one factor leading to the Industrial_Revolution. Steam
engines also use float valves and pressure_release_valves as mechanical
regulation devices. A mathematical_analysis of Watt's governor was done by
James_Clerk_Maxwell in 1868.[14]
The Great_Eastern was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a
steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by John_McFarlane
Gray. Joseph_Farcot coined the word servo in 1873 to describe steam-powered
steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns. Elmer
Ambrose_Sperry of the Sperry_Corporation designed the first autopilot in 1912.
Nicolas_Minorsky published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in
1922 and described the PID_controller.[34]
Internal combustion engines of the late 20th century employed mechanical
feedback mechanisms such as the vacuum_timing_advance but mechanical feedback
was replaced by electronic engine_management_systems once small, robust and
powerful single-chip microcontrollers became affordable.
**** Electronic engineering[edit] ****
The simplest form of a feedback amplifier can be represented by the ideal block
diagram made up of unilateral_elements.[35]
The use of feedback is widespread in the design of electronic components such
as amplifiers, oscillators, and stateful logic_circuit elements such as flip-
flops and counters. Electronic feedback systems are also very commonly used to
control mechanical, thermal and other physical processes.
If the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop, the system is said
to have negative_feedback;[36] otherwise, the feedback is said to be positive.
Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the stability
and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted
changes. This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can
respond to it. When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal
can result in over-correction, causing the output to oscillate or "hunt".[37]
While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used
deliberately in electronic oscillators.
Harry_Nyquist at Bell_Labs derived the Nyquist_stability_criterion for
determining the stability of feedback systems. An easier method, but less
general, is to use Bode_plots developed by Hendrik_Bode to determine the gain
margin_and_phase_margin. Design to ensure stability often involves frequency
compensation to control the location of the poles of the amplifier.
Electronic feedback loops are used to control the output of electronic devices,
such as amplifiers. A feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the
output is fed back to the input. A device is said to be operating open loop if
no output feedback is being employed and closed loop if feedback is being used.
[38]
When two or more amplifiers are cross-coupled using positive feedback, complex
behaviors can be created. These multivibrators are widely used and include:
    * astable circuits, which act as oscillators
    * monostable circuits, which can be pushed into a state, and will return to
      the stable state after some time
    * bistable circuits, which have two stable states that the circuit can be
      switched between
*** Negative feedback[edit] ***
A Negative feedback occurs when the fed-back output signal has a relative phase
of 180Â° with respect to the input signal (upside down). This situation is
sometimes referred to as being out of phase, but that term also is used to
indicate other phase separations, as in "90Â° out of phase". Negative feedback
can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted
fluctuations.[39] In feedback amplifiers, this correction is generally for
waveform distortion reduction[citation_needed] or to establish a specified gain
level. A general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is
the asymptotic_gain_model.
*** Positive feedback[edit] ***
Positive feedback occurs when the fed-back signal is in phase with the input
signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input
signal to the point where the output of the device oscillates between its
maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce
hysteresis into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals
and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a
digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device
to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its
maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics
to make bistable circuits for volatile storage of information.
The loud squeals that sometimes occurs in audio_systems, PA_systems, and rock
music are known as audio_feedback. If a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker
that it is connected to, sound that the microphone picks up comes out of the
speaker, and is picked up by the microphone and re-amplified. If the loop_gain
is sufficient, howling or squealing at the maximum power of the amplifier is
possible.
*** Oscillator[edit] ***
A popular op-amp_relaxation_oscillator.
An electronic_oscillator is an electronic_circuit that produces a periodic,
oscillating electronic signal, often a sine_wave or a square_wave.[40][41]
Oscillators convert direct_current (DC) from a power supply to an alternating
current signal. They are widely used in many electronic devices. Common
examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio
and television_transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz
clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video_games.[40]
Oscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal:
    * A low-frequency_oscillator (LFO) is an electronic oscillator that
      generates a frequency below â20 Hz. This term is typically used in the
      field of audio synthesizers, to distinguish it from an audio frequency
      oscillator.
    * An audio oscillator produces frequencies in the audio range, about 16 Hz
      to 20 kHz.[41]
    * An RF oscillator produces signals in the radio_frequency (RF) range of
      about 100 kHz to 100 GHz.[41]
Oscillators designed to produce a high-power AC output from a DC supply are
usually called inverters.
There are two main types of electronic oscillator: the linear or harmonic
oscillator and the nonlinear or relaxation_oscillator.[41][42]
*** Latches and flip-flops[edit] ***
A 4-bit ring_counter using D-type_flip_flops
A latch or a flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used
to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that
crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a
state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or
more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage
element in sequential_logic. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building
blocks of digital_electronics systems used in computers, communications, and
many other types of systems.
Latches and flip-flops are used as data storage elements. Such data storage can
be used for storage of state, and such a circuit is described as sequential
logic. When used in a finite-state_machine, the output and next state depend
not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence,
previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for
synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.
Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or clocked (synchronous
or edge-triggered). Although the term flip-flop has historically referred
generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common
to reserve the term flip-flop exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the
simple ones are commonly called latches.[43][44]
Using this terminology, a latch is level-sensitive, whereas a flip-flop is
edge-sensitive. That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while
a flip flop's output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative
going) of clock edge.
**** Software[edit] ****
Feedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running,
maintenance, and evolution of software and computing systems.[45] Feedback-
loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software, as they
define the behaviour of the interactions among the control elements over the
adaptation process, to guarantee system properties at run-time. Feedback loops
and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing
systems.[46] In particular, they have been applied to the development of
products such as IBM's_Universal_Database_server and IBM_Tivoli. From a
software perspective, the autonomic (MAPE, monitor analyze plan execute) loop
proposed by researchers of IBM is another valuable contribution to the
application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the
design and evolution of autonomic software systems.[47][48]
*** User interface design[edit] ***
Main article: User_interface_design
Feedback is also a useful design principle for designing user_interfaces.
**** Video feedback[edit] ****
Video_feedback is the video equivalent of acoustic_feedback. It involves a loop
between a video_camera input and a video output, e.g., a television_screen or
monitor. Aiming the camera at the display produces a complex video image based
on the feedback.[49]
**** Social sciences[edit] ****
For "feedback" in a performance or educational context, see performance
appraisal and corrective_feedback.
*** Economics and finance[edit] ***
The stock_market is an example of a system prone to oscillatory "hunting",
governed by positive and negative feedback resulting from cognitive_and
emotional_factors among market participants. For example:
    * When stocks are rising (a bull_market), the belief that further rises are
      probable gives investors an incentive to buy (positive
      feedbackâreinforcing the rise, see also stock_market_bubble and
      momentum_investing); but the increased price of the shares, and the
      knowledge that there must be a peak after which the market falls, ends up
      deterring buyers (negative feedbackâstabilizing the rise).
    * Once the market begins to fall regularly (a bear_market), some investors
      may expect further losing days and refrain from buying (positive
      feedbackâreinforcing the fall), but others may buy because stocks
      become more and more of a bargain (negative feedbackâstabilizing the
      fall, see also contrarian_investing).
George_Soros used the word reflexivity, to describe feedback in the financial
markets and developed an investment theory based on this principle.
The conventional economic_equilibrium model of supply_and_demand supports only
ideal linear negative feedback and was heavily criticized by Paul_Ormerod in
his book The_Death_of_Economics, which, in turn, was criticized by traditional
economists. This book was part of a change of perspective as economists started
to recognise that chaos_theory applied to nonlinear feedback systems including
financial markets.

      diagrams". Modeling the Environment. Island Press. pp. 99 ff.
      ISBN 9781610914253. This chapter describes causal_loop_diagrams to
      portray the information feedback at work in a system. The word causal
      refers to cause-and-effect relationships. The wordloop refers to a closed
      chain of cause and effect that creates the feedback.
