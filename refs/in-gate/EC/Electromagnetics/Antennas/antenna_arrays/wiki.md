****** Antenna array ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
A common type of array antenna, a reflective_array UHF television_antenna. It
consists of eight dipole driven_elements mounted in front of a wire screen
reflector. The X-shaped dipoles give it a wide bandwidth to cover both the VHF
(174–216 MHz) and UHF (470–700 MHz) TV bands. It has a gain of 5 dB VHF and
12 dB UHF and an 18 dB front-to-back ratio.
Large planar array antenna of a VHF Russian mobile air defense radar, the Nebo-
M. It consists of 175 folded dipole antennas driven in phase. It radiates a
narrow beam of radio waves perpendicular to the antenna.
An antenna array (or array antenna) is a set of multiple connected antennas
which work together as a single antenna, to transmit or receive radio_waves.
The individual antennas (called elements) are usually connected to a single
receiver or transmitter by feedlines that feed the power to the elements in a
specific phase relationship. The radio waves radiated by each individual
antenna combine and superpose, adding together (interfering_constructively) to
enhance the power radiated in desired directions, and cancelling (interfering
destructively) to reduce the power radiated in other directions. Similarly,
when used for receiving, the separate radio frequency currents from the
individual antennas combine in the receiver with the correct phase relationship
to enhance signals received from the desired directions and cancel signals from
undesired directions. More sophisticated array antennas may have multiple
transmitter or receiver modules, each connected to a separate antenna element
or group of elements.
An antenna array can achieve higher gain (directivity), that is a narrower beam
of radio waves, than could be achieved by a single element. In general, the
larger the number of individual antenna elements used, the higher the gain and
the narrower the beam. Some antenna arrays (such as military phased_array
radars) are composed of thousands of individual antennas. Arrays can be used to
achieve higher gain, to give path diversity (also called MIMO)[1] which
increases communication reliability, to cancel interference from specific
directions, to steer the radio beam electronically to point in different
directions, and for radio_direction_finding (RDF).[2]
The term antenna array most commonly means a driven array consisting of
multiple identical driven_elements all connected to the receiver or
transmitter. A parasitic array consists of a single driven element connected to
the feedline, and other elements which are not, called parasitic_elements. It
is usually another name for a Yagi-Uda_antenna.
A phased_array usually means an electronically scanned array; a driven array
antenna in which each individual element is connected to the transmitter or
receiver through a phase_shifter controlled by a computer. The beam of radio
waves can be steered electronically to point instantly in any direction over a
wide angle, without moving the antennas. However the term "phased array" is
sometimes used to mean an ordinary array antenna.[2]

***** Description[edit] *****
Small antennas around one wavelength in size, such as quarter-wave_monopoles
and half-wave_dipoles, don't have much directivity (gain); they are
omnidirectional_antennas which radiate radio waves over a wide angle. To create
a directional_antenna (high_gain_antenna), which radiates radio waves in a
narrow beam, two general techniques can be used. One technique is to use
reflection by large metal surfaces such as parabolic_reflectors or horns, or
refraction by dielectric lenses to change the direction of the radio waves, to
focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam. This type is
called an aperture antenna. A parabolic_dish is an example of this type of
antenna.
A second technique is to use multiple antennas which are fed from the same
transmitter or receiver; this is called an array antenna, or antenna array. If
the currents are fed to the antennas with the proper phase, due to the
phenomenon of interference the spherical waves from the individual antennas
combine (superpose) in front of the array to create plane_waves, a beam of
radio waves traveling in a specific direction. In directions in which the waves
from the individual antennas arrive in_phase, the waves add together
(constructive_interference) to enhance the power radiated. In directions in
which the individual waves arrive out_of_phase, with the peak of one wave
coinciding with the valley of another, the waves cancel (destructive
interference) reducing the power radiated in that direction. Similarly, when
receiving, the oscillating currents received by the separate antennas from
radio waves received from desired directions are in phase and when combined in
the receiver reinforce each other, while currents from radio waves received
from other directions are out of phase and when combined in the receiver cancel
each other.
The radiation_pattern of such an antenna consists of a strong beam in one
direction, the main_lobe, plus a series of weaker beams at different angles
called sidelobes, usually representing residual radiation in unwanted
directions. The larger the width of the antenna and the greater the number of
component antenna elements, the narrower the main lobe, and the higher the gain
which can be achieved, and the smaller the sidelobes will be.
Arrays in which the antenna elements are fed in phase are broadside arrays; the
main lobe is emitted perpendicular to the plane of the elements.
The largest array antennas are radio_interferometers used in the field of radio
astronomy, in which multiple radio_telescopes consisting of large parabolic
antennas are linked together into an antenna array, to achieve higher
resolution. Using the technique called aperture_synthesis such an array can
have the resolution of an antenna with a diameter equal to the distance between
the antennas. In the technique called Very_Long_Baseline_Interferometry (VLBI)
dishes on separate continents have been linked, creating "array antennas"
thousands of miles in size.

***** Types[edit] *****
Most array antennas can be divided into two classes based on how the component
antennas' axis is related to the direction of radiation.
    * A broadside array is a one or two dimensional array in which the
      direction of radiation (main_lobe) of the radio waves is perpendicular to
      the plane of the antennas. To radiate perpendicularly, the antennas must
      be fed in phase.
    * An endfire array is a linear array in which the direction of radiation is
      along the line of the antennas. The antennas must be fed with a phase
      difference equal to the separation of adjacent antennas.
There are also arrays (such as phased_arrays) which don't belong to either of
these categories, in which the direction of radiation is at some other angle to
the antenna axis.

Driven array - This is an array in which the individual component antennas are
all "driven" - connected to the transmitter or receiver. The individual
antennas, which are usually identical, often consist of single driven_elements,
such as half-wave_dipoles, but may also be composite antennas such as Yagi
antennas or turnstile_antennas.
    * Collinear_array - a broadside array consisting of multiple identical
      dipole antennas oriented vertically in a line. This is a high gain
      omnidirectional_antenna, often used in the VHF band as base station
      antennas for land mobile services.
          o Superturnstile or Batwing array - specialized vertical antenna used
            for television broadcasting consisting of multiple crossed-dipole
            antennas mounted collinearly on a mast. High gain omnidirectional
            radiation pattern with wide bandwidth.
    * Planar array - a flat two-dimensional array of antennas. Since an array
      of omnidirectional antennas radiates two beams 180Â° apart broadside from
      both sides of the antenna, it often is either mounted in front of a
      reflector, or is composed of directive antennas such as Yagi or helical
      antennas, to give a unidirectional beam.
          o Reflective_array - a planar array of antennas, often half-wave
            dipoles fed in phase, in front of a flat reflector such as a metal
            plate or wire screen. This radiates a single beam of radio waves
            perpendicular (broadside) to the array. Used as UHF television
            antennas and radar antennas.
                # Curtain_array - an outdoor wire shortwave transmitting
                  antenna consisting of a planar array of wire dipoles
                  suspended in front of a vertical reflector made of a
                  "curtain" of parallel wires. Used on HF band as long distance
                  transmitting antenna for shortwave broadcasting stations. May
                  be steered as phased array.
                # Microstrip_antenna - an array of patch_antennas fabricated on
                  a printed_circuit_board with copper foil on the reverse side
                  functioning as a reflector. The elements are fed through
                  striplines made of copper foil. Used as UHF and satellite
                  television antennas.
          o Phased_array or electronically scanned array - A planar array in
            which the beam can be steered electronically to point in any
            direction over a wide angle in front of the array, without
            physically moving the antenna. The current from the transmitter is
            fed to each component antenna through a phase_shifter, controlled
            by a computer. By changing the relative phase of the feed currents,
            the beam can instantly be pointed in different directions. Widely
            used in military radars, this technique is rapidly spreading to
            civilian applications.
                # Passive_Electronically_Scanned_Array (PESA) - A phased array
                  as described above, in which the antenna elements are fed
                  from a single transmitter or receiver through phase shifters.
                # Active_Electronically_Scanned_Array (AESA) - A phased array
                  in which each antenna element has its own transmitter and/or
                  receiver module, controlled by a central computer. This
                  second generation phased array technology can radiate
                  multiple beams at multiple frequencies simultaneously, and is
                  mostly used in sophisticated military radars.
          o Conformal_array - a two-dimensional phased array which is not flat,
            but conforms to some curved surface. The individual elements are
            driven by phase_shifters which compensate for the varying path
            lengths, allowing the antenna to radiate a plane wave beam.
            Conformal antennas are often integrated into the curving skin of
            aircraft and missiles, to reduce aerodynamic drag.
          o Smart_antenna, reconfigurable_antenna or adaptive array - a
            receiving array that estimates the direction of arrival of the
            radio waves and electronically optimizes the radiation pattern
            adaptively to receive it, synthesizing a main_lobe in that
            direction.[3] Like a phased array it consists of multiple identical
            elements with phase_shifters in the feed lines, controlled by a
            computer.
    * Log_periodic_dipole_array (LPDA) - an endfire array consisting of many
      dipole driven elements in a line, with gradually increasing length. It
      acts as a high gain broadband antenna. Used as television reception
      antennas and for shortwave communication.
A rooftop television_antenna, an endfire parasitic array consisting of a
combination of a Yagi and log_periodic antenna
Parasitic array - This is an endfire array which consist of multiple antenna
elements in a line of which only one, the driven_element, is connected to the
transmitter or receiver, while the other elements, called parasitic_elements,
are not. The parasitic elements function as resonators, absorbing radio waves
from the driven element and reradiating them with a different phase, to modify
the radiation pattern of the antenna, increasing the power radiated in the
desired direction. Since these have only one driven element they are often
called "antennas" instead of "arrays".
    * Yagi-Uda_antenna or Yagi antenna - this endfire array consists of
      multiple half-wave dipole elements in a line. It consists of a single
      driven element with multiple "director" parasitic elements in the
      direction of radiation, and usually a single "reflector" parasitic
      element behind it. They are widely used on the HF, VHF, and UHF bands as
      television antennas, shortwave communication antennas, and in radar
      arrays.
    * Quad_antenna - This consists of multiple loop_antennas in a line, with
      one driven loop and the others parasitic. Functions similarly to the Yagi
      antenna.
