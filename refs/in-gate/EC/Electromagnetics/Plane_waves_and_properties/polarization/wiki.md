            sense) of electromagnetic waves transmitted by or received by a
            radio antenna

    * Polarization of an Abelian_variety, in the mathematics of complex
      manifolds
    * Polarization_of_an_algebraic_form, a technique for expressing a
      homogeneous polynomial in a simpler fashion by adjoining more variables
    * Polarization_identity, expresses an inner product in terms of its
      associated norm
***** In the social sciences *****
    * Polarization_(economics), an economic process where middle-class jobs
      disappear more than those at the bottom and the top
    * Polarization_(psychology), the process whereby a social or political
      group is divided into opposing sub-groups
    * Political_polarization, the process by which the public opinion divides
      and goes to the extremes
    * Social_polarization
          o Attitude_polarization
          o Group_polarization
          o Racial_polarization, the process whereby a population with

            racial groups
***** Other *****
    * Polarization_(album), an album by American jazz trombonist and composer
