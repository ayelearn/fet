Material and chemical process
An ion implantation system at LAAS technological facility in Toulouse, France.
Ion implantation is a low-temperature process by which ions of one element are
accelerated into a solid target, thereby changing the physical, chemical, or
electrical properties of the target. Ion implantation is used in semiconductor
device_fabrication and in metal finishing, as well as in materials_science
research. The ions can alter the elemental composition of the target (if the
ions differ in composition from the target) if they stop and remain in the
target. Ion implantation also causes chemical and physical changes when the
ions impinge on the target at high energy. The crystal_structure of the target
can be damaged or even destroyed by the energetic collision_cascades, and ions
of sufficiently high energy (10s of MeV) can cause nuclear_transmutation.

***** General principle[edit] *****
Ion implantation setup with mass separator
Ion implantation equipment typically consists of an ion_source, where ions of
the desired element are produced, an accelerator, where the ions are
electrostatically accelerated to a high energy, and a target chamber, where the
ions impinge on a target, which is the material to be implanted. Thus ion
implantation is a special case of particle_radiation. Each ion is typically a
single atom or molecule, and thus the actual amount of material implanted in
the target is the integral over time of the ion current. This amount is called
the dose. The currents supplied by implants are typically small (micro-
amperes), and thus the dose which can be implanted in a reasonable amount of
time is small. Therefore, ion implantation finds application in cases where the
amount of chemical change required is small.
Typical ion energies are in the range of 10 to 500 keV (1,600 to 80,000 aJ).
Energies in the range 1 to 10 keV (160 to 1,600 aJ) can be used, but result in
a penetration of only a few nanometers or less. Energies lower than this result
in very little damage to the target, and fall under the designation ion_beam
deposition. Higher energies can also be used: accelerators capable of 5 MeV
(800,000 aJ) are common. However, there is often great structural damage to the
target, and because the depth distribution is broad (Bragg_peak), the net
composition change at any point in the target will be small.
The energy of the ions, as well as the ion species and the composition of the
target determine the depth of penetration of the ions in the solid: A
monoenergetic ion beam will generally have a broad depth distribution. The
average penetration depth is called the range of the ions. Under typical
circumstances ion ranges will be between 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. Thus,
ion implantation is especially useful in cases where the chemical or structural
change is desired to be near the surface of the target. Ions gradually lose
their energy as they travel through the solid, both from occasional collisions
with target atoms (which cause abrupt energy transfers) and from a mild drag
from overlap of electron orbitals, which is a continuous process. The loss of
ion energy in the target is called stopping and can be simulated with the
binary_collision_approximation method.
Accelerator systems for ion implantation are generally classified into medium
current (ion beam currents between 10 Î¼A and ~2 mA), high current (ion beam
currents up to ~30 mA), high energy (ion energies above 200 keV and up to 10
MeV), and very high dose (efficient implant of dose greater than 1016ions/cm2).
[citation_needed]
All varieties of ion implantation beamline designs contain certain general
groups of functional components (see image). The first major segment of an ion
beamline includes a device known as an ion source to generate the ion species.
The source is closely coupled to biased electrodes for extraction of the ions
into the beamline and most often to some means of selecting a particular ion
species for transport into the main accelerator section. The "mass" selection
is often accompanied by passage of the extracted ion beam through a magnetic
field region with an exit path restricted by blocking apertures, or "slits",
that allow only ions with a specific value of the product of mass and velocity/
charge to continue down the beamline. If the target surface is larger than the
ion beam diameter and a uniform distribution of implanted dose is desired over
the target surface, then some combination of beam scanning and wafer motion is
used. Finally, the implanted surface is coupled with some method for collecting
the accumulated charge of the implanted ions so that the delivered dose can be
measured in a continuous fashion and the implant process stopped at the desired
dose level.[1]
***** Application in semiconductor device fabrication[edit] *****
**** Doping[edit] ****
Semiconductor_doping with boron, phosphorus, or arsenic is a common application
of ion implantation. When implanted in a semiconductor, each dopant atom can
create a charge carrier in the semiconductor after annealing. A hole can be
created for a p-type dopant, and an electron for an n-type dopant. This
modifies the conductivity of the semiconductor in its vicinity. The technique
is used, for example, for adjusting the threshold of a MOSFET.
Ion implantation was developed as a method of producing the p-n junction of
photovoltaic devices in the late 1970s and early 1980s,[2] along with the use
of pulsed-electron beam for rapid annealing,[3] although it has not to date
been used for commercial production.
**** Silicon on insulator[edit] ****
One prominent method for preparing silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates from
conventional silicon substrates is the SIMOX (separation by implantation of
oxygen) process, wherein a buried high dose oxygen implant is converted to
silicon oxide by a high temperature annealing process.
**** Mesotaxy[edit] ****
Mesotaxy is the term for the growth of a crystallographically matching phase
underneath the surface of the host crystal (compare to epitaxy, which is the
growth of the matching phase on the surface of a substrate). In this process,
ions are implanted at a high enough energy and dose into a material to create a
layer of a second phase, and the temperature is controlled so that the crystal
structure of the target is not destroyed. The crystal orientation of the layer
can be engineered to match that of the target, even though the exact crystal
structure and lattice constant may be very different. For example, after the
implantation of nickel ions into a silicon wafer, a layer of nickel_silicide
can be grown in which the crystal orientation of the silicide matches that of
the silicon.
***** Application in metal finishing[edit] *****
**** Tool steel toughening[edit] ****
Nitrogen or other ions can be implanted into a tool steel target (drill bits,
for example). The structural change caused by the implantation produces a
surface compression in the steel, which prevents crack propagation and thus
makes the material more resistant to fracture. The chemical change can also
make the tool more resistant to corrosion.
**** Surface finishing[edit] ****
In some applications, for example prosthetic devices such as artificial joints,
it is desired to have surfaces very resistant to both chemical corrosion and
wear due to friction. Ion implantation is used in such cases to engineer the
surfaces of such devices for more reliable performance. As in the case of tool
steels, the surface modification caused by ion implantation includes both a
surface compression which prevents crack propagation and an alloying of the
surface to make it more chemically resistant to corrosion.
***** Other applications[edit] *****
**** Ion beam mixing[edit] ****
Ion implantation can be used to achieve ion_beam_mixing, i.e. mixing up atoms
of different elements at an interface. This may be useful for achieving graded
interfaces or strengthening adhesion between layers of immiscible materials.
**** Ion implantation-induced nanoparticle formation[edit] ****
Ion implantation may be used to induce nano-dimensional particles in oxides
such as sapphire and silica. The particles may be formed as a result of
precipitation of the ion implanted species, they may be formed as a result of
the production of an mixed oxide species that contains both the ion-implanted
element and the oxide substrate, and they may be formed as a result of a
reduction of the substrate, first reported by Hunt and Hampikian.[4][5][6]
Typical ion beam energies used to produce nanoparticles range from 50 to 150
keV, with ion fluences that range from 1016 to 1018 ions/cm2.[7][8][9][10][11]
[12][13][14][15] The table below summarizes some of the work that has been done
in this field for a sapphire substrate. A wide variety of nanoparticles can be
formed, with size ranges from 1 nm on up to 20 nm and with compositions that
can contain the implanted species, combinations of the implanted ion and
substrate, or that are comprised solely from the cation associated with the
substrate.
Composite materials based on dielectrics such as sapphire that contain
dispersed metal nanoparticles are promising materials for optoelectronics and
nonlinear_optics.[11]

***** Problems with ion implantation[edit] *****
**** Crystallographic damage[edit] ****
Each individual ion produces many point_defects in the target crystal on impact
such as vacancies and interstitials. Vacancies are crystal lattice points
unoccupied by an atom: in this case the ion collides with a target atom,
resulting in transfer of a significant amount of energy to the target atom such
that it leaves its crystal site. This target atom then itself becomes a
projectile in the solid, and can cause successive_collision_events.
Interstitials result when such atoms (or the original ion itself) come to rest
in the solid, but find no vacant space in the lattice to reside. These point
defects can migrate and cluster with each other, resulting in dislocation loops
and other defects.
**** Damage recovery[edit] ****
Because ion implantation causes damage to the crystal structure of the target
which is often unwanted, ion implantation processing is often followed by a
thermal annealing. This can be referred to as damage recovery.
**** Amorphization[edit] ****
The amount of crystallographic damage can be enough to completely amorphize the
surface of the target: i.e. it can become an amorphous_solid (such a solid
produced from a melt is called a glass). In some cases, complete amorphization
of a target is preferable to a highly defective crystal: An amorphized film can
be regrown at a lower temperature than required to anneal a highly damaged
crystal. Amorphisation of the substrate can occur as a result of the beam
damage. For example, yttrium ion implantation into sapphire at an ion beam
energy of 150 keV to a fluence of 5*1016 Y+/cm2 produces an amorphous glassy
layer approximately 110 nm in thickness, measured from the outer surface.
[Hunt, 1999]
**** Sputtering[edit] ****
Some of the collision events result in atoms being ejected (sputtered) from the
surface, and thus ion implantation will slowly etch away a surface. The effect
is only appreciable for very large doses.
**** Ion channelling[edit] ****
A diamond cubic crystal viewed from the <110> direction, showing hexagonal ion
channels.
If there is a crystallographic structure to the target, and especially in
semiconductor substrates where the crystal structure is more open, particular
crystallographic directions offer much lower stopping than other directions.
The result is that the range of an ion can be much longer if the ion travels
exactly along a particular direction, for example the <110> direction in
silicon and other diamond_cubic materials.[16] This effect is called ion
channelling, and, like all the channelling effects, is highly nonlinear, with
small variations from perfect orientation resulting in extreme differences in
implantation depth. For this reason, most implantation is carried out a few
degrees off-axis, where tiny alignment errors will have more predictable
effects.
Ion channelling can be used directly in Rutherford_backscattering and related
techniques as an analytical method to determine the amount and depth profile of
damage in crystalline thin film materials.
***** Safety[edit] *****
**** Hazardous materials[edit] ****
In fabricating wafers, toxic materials such as arsine and phosphine are often
used in the ion implanter process. Other common carcinogenic, corrosive,
flammable, or toxic elements include antimony, arsenic, phosphorus, and boron.
Semiconductor_fabrication facilities are highly automated, but residue of
hazardous elements in machines can be encountered during servicing and in
vacuum_pump hardware.
**** High voltages and particle accelerators[edit] ****
High voltage power supplies used in ion accelerators necessary for ion
implantation can pose a risk of electrical_injury. In addition, high-energy
atomic collisions can generate X-rays and, in some cases, other ionizing
radiation and radionuclides. In addition to high voltage, particle_accelerators
such as radio frequency linear_particle_accelerators and laser wakefield_plasma
accelerators other hazards.
