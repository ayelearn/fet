This article is about the generic concept of the time-dependent process. For
other uses, see Diffusion_(disambiguation).
A diffusion is a process in science . Some particles are dissolved in a glass
of water. At first, the particles are all near one top corner of the glass. If
the particles randomly move around ("diffuse") in the water, they eventually
become distributed randomly and uniformly from an area of high concentration to
an area of low concentration, and organized (diffusion continues, but with no
net flux).

Diffusion from a microscopic and macroscopic point of view. Initially, there
are solute molecules on the left side of a barrier (purple line) and none on
the right. The barrier is removed, and the solute diffuses to fill the whole
container. Top: A single molecule moves around randomly. Middle: With more
molecules, there is a statistical trend that the solute fills the container
more and more uniformly. Bottom: With an enormous number of solute molecules,
all randomness is gone: The solute appears to move smoothly and
deterministically from high-concentration areas to low-concentration areas.
There is no microscopic force pushing molecules rightward, but there appears to
be one in the bottom panel. This apparent force is called an entropic_force.

Diffusion is net movement of anything (e.g., ideas, ions, molecules) from a
region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Diffusion is
driven by a gradient in concentration.
The concept of diffusion is widely used in: physics (particle_diffusion),
chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, and finance (diffusion of people,
ideas and of price values). However, in each case, the object (e.g., atom,
idea, etc.) that is undergoing diffusion is âspreading outâ from a point or
location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.
A gradient is the change in the value of a quantity e.g. concentration,
pressure, or temperature with the change in another variable, usually distance.
A change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient, a
change in pressure over a distance is called a pressure_gradient, and a change
in temperature over a distance is called a temperature_gradient.
The word diffusion derives from the Latin word, diffundere, which means "to
spread way out.â
A distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it depends on particle random
walk, and results in mixing or mass transport without requiring directed bulk
motion. Bulk motion, or bulk flow, is the characteristic of advection.[1] The
term convection is used to describe the combination of both transport
phenomena.

***** Diffusion vs. bulk flow[edit] *****
"Bulk flow" is the movement/flow of an entire body due to a pressure gradient
(eg water coming out of a tap). "Diffusion" is the gradual movement/dispersion
of concentration within a body, due to a concentration gradient, with no net
movement of matter. An example of a process where both bulk_motion and
diffusion occur is human breathing.
First there is a "bulk flow" process. The lungs are located in the thoracic
cavity, which expands as the first step in external respiration. This expansion
leads to an increase in volume of the alveoli in the lungs, which causes a
decrease in pressure in the alveoli. This creates a pressure gradient between
the air outside the body at relatively high pressure and the alveoli at
relatively low pressure. The air moves down the pressure gradient through the
airways of the lungs and into the alveoli until the pressure of the air and
that in the alveoli are equal i.e. the movement of air by bulk flow stops once
there is no longer a pressure gradient.
Secondly there a "diffusion" process. The air arriving in the alveoli has a
higher concentration of oxygen than the âstaleâ air in the alveoli. The
increase in oxygen concentration creates a concentration gradient for oxygen
between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the capillaries that surround
the alveoli. Oxygen then moves by diffusion, down the concentration gradient,
into the blood. The other consequence of the air arriving in alveoli is that
the concentration of carbon_dioxide in the alveoli decreases. This creates a
concentration gradient for carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the
alveoli, as fresh air has a very low concentration of carbon dioxide compared
to the blood in the body.
Thirdly there is another "bulk flow" process. The pumping action of the heart
then transports the blood around the body. As the left ventricle of the heart
contracts, the volume decreases, which increases the pressure in the ventricle.
This creates a pressure gradient between the heart and the capillaries, and
blood moves through blood_vessels by bulk flow down the pressure gradient.
***** Diffusion in the context of different disciplines[edit] *****
Diffusion furnaces used for thermal_oxidation
The concept of diffusion is widely used in: physics (particle_diffusion),
chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, and finance (diffusion of people,
ideas and of price values). However, in each case, the object (e.g., atom,
idea, etc.) that is undergoing diffusion is âspreading outâ from a point or
location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.
There are two ways to introduce the notion of diffusion: either a
phenomenological_approach starting with Fick's_laws_of_diffusion and their
mathematical consequences, or a physical and atomistic one, by considering the
random_walk of the diffusing particles.[2]
In the phenomenological approach, diffusion is the movement of a substance from
a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration without bulk
motion. According to Fick's laws, the diffusion flux is proportional to the
negative gradient of concentrations. It goes from regions of higher
concentration to regions of lower concentration. Sometime later, various
generalizations of Fick's laws were developed in the frame of thermodynamics
and non-equilibrium_thermodynamics.[3]
From the atomistic point of view, diffusion is considered as a result of the
random walk of the diffusing particles. In molecular_diffusion, the moving
molecules are self-propelled by thermal energy. Random walk of small particles
in suspension in a fluid was discovered in 1827 by Robert_Brown. The theory of
the Brownian_motion and the atomistic backgrounds of diffusion were developed
by Albert_Einstein.[4] The concept of diffusion is typically applied to any
subject matter involving random walks in ensembles of individuals.
Biologists often use the terms "net movement" or "net diffusion" to describe
the movement of ions or molecules by diffusion. For example, oxygen can diffuse
through cell membranes so long as there is a higher concentration of oxygen
outside the cell. However, because the movement of molecules is random,
occasionally oxygen molecules move out of the cell (against the concentration
gradient). Because there are more oxygen molecules outside the cell, the
probability that oxygen molecules will enter the cell is higher than the
probability that oxygen molecules will leave the cell. Therefore, the "net"
movement of oxygen molecules (the difference between the number of molecules
either entering or leaving the cell) is into the cell. In other words, there is
a net movement of oxygen molecules down the concentration gradient.
***** History of diffusion in physics[edit] *****
In the scope of time, diffusion in solids was used long before the theory of
diffusion was created. For example, Pliny_the_Elder had previously described
the cementation_process, which produces steel from the element iron (Fe)
through carbon diffusion. Another example is well known for many centuries, the
diffusion of colors of stained_glass or earthenware and Chinese_ceramics.
In modern science, the first systematic experimental study of diffusion was
performed by Thomas_Graham. He studied diffusion in gases, and the main
phenomenon was described by him in 1831â1833:[5]
     "...gases of different nature, when brought into contact, do not
     arrange themselves according to their density, the heaviest
     undermost, and the lighter uppermost, but they spontaneously diffuse,
     mutually and equally, through each other, and so remain in the
     intimate state of mixture for any length of time.â
The measurements of Graham contributed to James_Clerk_Maxwell deriving, in
1867, the coefficient of diffusion for CO2 in the air. The error rate is less
than 5%.
In 1855, Adolf_Fick, the 26-year-old anatomy demonstrator from ZÃ¼rich,
proposed his_law_of_diffusion. He used Graham's research, stating his goal as
"the development of a fundamental law, for the operation of diffusion in a
single element of space". He asserted a deep analogy between diffusion and
conduction of heat or electricity, creating a formalism that is similar to
Fourier's_law_for_heat_conduction (1822) and Ohm's_law for electric current
(1827).
Robert_Boyle demonstrated diffusion in solids in the 17th century[6] by
penetration of zinc into a copper coin. Nevertheless, diffusion in solids was
not systematically studied until the second part of the 19th century. William
Chandler_Roberts-Austen, the well-known British metallurgist and former
assistant of Thomas Graham studied systematically solid state diffusion on the
example of gold in lead in 1896. :[7]
     "... My long connection with Graham's researches made it almost a
     duty to attempt to extend his work on liquid diffusion to metals."
In 1858, Rudolf_Clausius introduced the concept of the mean_free_path. In the
same year, James_Clerk_Maxwell developed the first atomistic theory of
transport processes in gases. The modern atomistic theory of diffusion and
Brownian_motion was developed by Albert_Einstein, Marian_Smoluchowski and Jean-
Baptiste_Perrin. Ludwig_Boltzmann, in the development of the atomistic
backgrounds of the macroscopic transport_processes, introduced the Boltzmann
equation, which has served mathematics and physics with a source of transport
process ideas and concerns for more than 140 years.[8]
In 1920â1921, George_de_Hevesy measured self-diffusion using radioisotopes.
He studied self-diffusion of radioactive isotopes of lead in the liquid and
solid lead.
Yakov_Frenkel (sometimes, Jakov/Jacob Frenkel) proposed, and elaborated in
1926, the idea of diffusion in crystals through local defects (vacancies and
interstitial atoms). He concluded, the diffusion process in condensed matter is
an ensemble of elementary jumps and quasichemical interactions of particles and
defects. He introduced several mechanisms of diffusion and found rate constants
from experimental data.
Sometime later, Carl_Wagner and Walter_H._Schottky developed Frenkel's ideas
about mechanisms of diffusion further. Presently, it is universally recognized
that atomic defects are necessary to mediate diffusion in crystals.[7]
Henry_Eyring, with co-authors, applied his theory of absolute_reaction_rates to
Frenkel's quasichemical model of diffusion.[9] The analogy between reaction
kinetics and diffusion leads to various nonlinear versions of Fick's law.[10]
***** Basic models of diffusion[edit] *****
**** Diffusion flux[edit] ****
Each model of diffusion expresses the diffusion flux through concentrations,
densities and their derivatives. Flux is a vector      J    {\displaystyle
\mathbf {J} }  [\mathbf {J} ]. The transfer of a physical_quantity     N
{\displaystyle N}  [N] through a small area     &#x0394; S   {\displaystyle
\Delta S}  [\Delta S] with normal     &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle \nu }  [\nu ]
per time     &#x0394; t   {\displaystyle \Delta t}  [\Delta t] is
         &#x0394; N = (  J  , &#x03BD; )  &#x0394; S  &#x0394; t + o ( &#x0394;
      S  &#x0394; t )  ,   {\displaystyle \Delta N=(\mathbf {J} ,\nu )\,\Delta
      S\,\Delta t+o(\Delta S\,\Delta t)\,,}  [{\displaystyle \Delta N=(\mathbf
      {J} ,\nu )\,\Delta S\,\Delta t+o(\Delta S\,\Delta t)\,,}]
where     (  J  , &#x03BD; )   {\displaystyle (\mathbf {J} ,\nu )}  [(\mathbf
{J},\nu)] is the inner_product and     o ( &#x22EF; )   {\displaystyle o(\cdots
)}  [{\displaystyle o(\cdots )}] is the little-o_notation. If we use the
notation of vector_area     &#x0394;  S  = &#x03BD;  &#x0394; S
{\displaystyle \Delta \mathbf {S} =\nu \,\Delta S}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
\mathbf {S} =\nu \,\Delta S}] then
         &#x0394; N = (  J  , &#x0394;  S  )  &#x0394; t + o ( &#x0394;  S
      &#x0394; t )  .   {\displaystyle \Delta N=(\mathbf {J} ,\Delta \mathbf
      {S} )\,\Delta t+o(\Delta \mathbf {S} \,\Delta t)\,.}  [{\displaystyle
      \Delta N=(\mathbf {J} ,\Delta \mathbf {S} )\,\Delta t+o(\Delta \mathbf
      {S} \,\Delta t)\,.}]
The dimension of the diffusion flux is [flux] = [quantity]/([time]Â·[area]).
The diffusing physical quantity     N   {\displaystyle N}  [N] may be the
number of particles, mass, energy, electric charge, or any other scalar
extensive_quantity. For its density,     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n], the
diffusion equation has the form
            &#x2202; n   &#x2202; t    = &#x2212; &#x2207; &#x22C5;  J  + W  ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial n}{\partial t}}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf {J}
      +W\,,}  [\frac{\partial n}{\partial t}= - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} +W \,
      ,]
where     W   {\displaystyle W}  [W] is intensity of any local source of this
quantity (the rate of a chemical reaction, for example). For the diffusion
equation, the no-flux boundary conditions can be formulated as     (  J  ( x )
, &#x03BD; ( x ) ) = 0   {\displaystyle (\mathbf {J} (x),\nu (x))=0}  [(\mathbf
{J}(x),\nu(x))=0] on the boundary, where     &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle \nu }
[\nu ] is the normal to the boundary at point     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x].
**** Fick's law and equations[edit] ****
Main article: Fick's_laws_of_diffusion
Fick's first law: the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the
concentration gradient:
          J  = &#x2212; D  &#x2207; n &#xA0; ,    J  i   = &#x2212; D
      &#x2202; n   &#x2202;  x  i      &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =-
      D\,\nabla n\ ,\;\;J_{i}=-D{\frac {\partial n}{\partial x_{i}}}\ .}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =-D\,\nabla n\ ,\;\;J_{i}=-D{\frac {\partial
      n}{\partial x_{i}}}\ .}]
The corresponding diffusion equation (Fick's second law) is
            &#x2202; n ( x , t )   &#x2202; t    = &#x2207; &#x22C5; ( D
      &#x2207; n ( x , t ) ) = D  &#x0394; n ( x , t ) &#xA0; ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial n(x,t)}{\partial t}}=\nabla \cdot
      (D\,\nabla n(x,t))=D\,\Delta n(x,t)\ ,}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial
      n(x,t)}{\partial t}}=\nabla \cdot (D\,\nabla n(x,t))=D\,\Delta n(x,t)\
      ,}]
where     &#x0394;   {\displaystyle \Delta }  [\Delta ] is the Laplace
operator,
         &#x0394; n ( x , t ) =  &#x2211;  i       &#x2202;  2   n ( x , t )
      &#x2202;  x  i   2      &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle \Delta n(x,t)=\sum _{i}
      {\frac {\partial ^{2}n(x,t)}{\partial x_{i}^{2}}}\ .}  [\Delta n(x,t) =
      \sum_i \frac{\partial^2 n(x,t)}{\partial x_i^2} \ .]
**** Onsager's equations for multicomponent diffusion and thermodiffusion[edit]
****
Fick's law describes diffusion of an admixture in a medium. The concentration
of this admixture should be small and the gradient of this concentration should
be also small. The driving force of diffusion in Fick's law is the antigradient
of concentration,     &#x2212; &#x2207; n   {\displaystyle -\nabla n}  [-\nabla
n].
In 1931, Lars_Onsager[11] included the multicomponent transport processes in
the general context of linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics. For multi-
component transport,
           J   i   =  &#x2211;  j    L  i j    X  j    ,   {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {J} _{i}=\sum _{j}L_{ij}X_{j}\,,}  [\mathbf{J}_i=\sum_j L_{ij}
      X_j \, ,]
where       J   i     {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{i}}  [\mathbf {J} _{i}] is
the flux of the ith physical quantity (component) and      X  j
{\displaystyle X_{j}}  [X_{j}] is the jth thermodynamic_force.
The thermodynamic forces for the transport processes were introduced by Onsager
as the space gradients of the derivatives of the entropy density s (he used the
term "force" in quotation marks or "driving force"):
          X  i   = grad &#x2061;    &#x2202; s ( n )   &#x2202;  n  i
      &#xA0; ,   {\displaystyle X_{i}=\operatorname {grad} {\frac {\partial s
      (n)}{\partial n_{i}}}\ ,}  [{\displaystyle X_{i}=\operatorname {grad}
      {\frac {\partial s(n)}{\partial n_{i}}}\ ,}]
where      n  i     {\displaystyle n_{i}}  [n_{i}] are the "thermodynamic
coordinates". For the heat and mass transfer one can take      n  0   = u
{\displaystyle n_{0}=u}  [n_0=u] (the density of internal energy) and      n  i
{\displaystyle n_{i}}  [n_{i}] is the concentration of the ith component. The
corresponding driving forces are the space vectors
          X  0   = grad &#x2061;   1 T   &#xA0; ,     X  i   = &#x2212; grad
      &#x2061;    &#x03BC;  i   T    ( i > 0 ) ,   {\displaystyle X_
      {0}=\operatorname {grad} {\frac {1}{T}}\ ,\;\;\;X_{i}=-\operatorname
      {grad} {\frac {\mu _{i}}{T}}\;(i>0),}  [{\displaystyle X_
      {0}=\operatorname {grad} {\frac {1}{T}}\ ,\;\;\;X_{i}=-\operatorname
      {grad} {\frac {\mu _{i}}{T}}\;(i>0),}] because      d  s =   1 T     d  u
      &#x2212;  &#x2211;  i &#x2265; 1      &#x03BC;  i   T      d    n  i
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} s={\frac {1}{T}}\,\mathrm {d} u-\sum _{i\geq
      1}{\frac {\mu _{i}}{T}}\,{\rm {d}}n_{i}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} s=
      {\frac {1}{T}}\,\mathrm {d} u-\sum _{i\geq 1}{\frac {\mu _{i}}{T}}\,{\rm
      {d}}n_{i}}]
where T is the absolute temperature and      &#x03BC;  i     {\displaystyle \mu
_{i}}  [\mu _{i}] is the chemical potential of the ith component. It should be
stressed that the separate diffusion equations describe the mixing or mass
transport without bulk motion. Therefore, the terms with variation of the total
pressure are neglected. It is possible for diffusion of small admixtures and
for small gradients.
For the linear Onsager equations, we must take the thermodynamic forces in the
linear approximation near equilibrium:
          X  i   =  &#x2211;  k &#x2265; 0          &#x2202;  2   s ( n )
      &#x2202;  n  i    &#x2202;  n  k      |   n =  n  &#x2217;     grad
      &#x2061;  n  k   &#xA0; ,   {\displaystyle X_{i}=\sum _{k\geq 0}\left.
      {\frac {\partial ^{2}s(n)}{\partial n_{i}\,\partial n_{k}}}\right|_{n=n^
      {*}}\operatorname {grad} n_{k}\ ,}  [{\displaystyle X_{i}=\sum _{k\geq
      0}\left.{\frac {\partial ^{2}s(n)}{\partial n_{i}\,\partial n_
      {k}}}\right|_{n=n^{*}}\operatorname {grad} n_{k}\ ,}]
where the derivatives of s are calculated at equilibrium n*. The matrix of the
kinetic coefficients      L  i j     {\displaystyle L_{ij}}  [L_{ij}] should be
symmetric (Onsager_reciprocal_relations) and positive_definite (for_the_entropy
growth).
The transport equations are
            &#x2202;  n  i     &#x2202; t    = &#x2212; div &#x2061;   J   i
      = &#x2212;  &#x2211;  j &#x2265; 0    L  i j   div &#x2061;  X  j   =
      &#x2211;  k &#x2265; 0    [  &#x2212;  &#x2211;  j &#x2265; 0    L  i j
      &#x2202;  2   s ( n )   &#x2202;  n  j    &#x2202;  n  k      |   n =  n
      &#x2217;      ]   &#x0394;  n  k   &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {\partial n_{i}}{\partial t}}=-\operatorname {div} \mathbf {J} _{i}=-\sum
      _{j\geq 0}L_{ij}\operatorname {div} X_{j}=\sum _{k\geq 0}\left[-\sum _
      {j\geq 0}L_{ij}\left.{\frac {\partial ^{2}s(n)}{\partial n_{j}\,\partial
      n_{k}}}\right|_{n=n^{*}}\right]\,\Delta n_{k}\ .}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {\partial n_{i}}{\partial t}}=-\operatorname {div} \mathbf {J} _{i}=-\sum
      _{j\geq 0}L_{ij}\operatorname {div} X_{j}=\sum _{k\geq 0}\left[-\sum _
      {j\geq 0}L_{ij}\left.{\frac {\partial ^{2}s(n)}{\partial n_{j}\,\partial
      n_{k}}}\right|_{n=n^{*}}\right]\,\Delta n_{k}\ .}]
Here, all the indexes i, j, k = 0, 1, 2, ... are related to the internal energy
(0) and various components. The expression in the square brackets is the matrix
D  i k     {\displaystyle D_{ik}}  [D_{ik}]of the diffusion (i,k > 0),
thermodiffusion (i > 0, k = 0 or k > 0, i = 0) and thermal_conductivity
(i = k = 0) coefficients.
Under isothermal_conditions T = constant. The relevant thermodynamic potential
is the free energy (or the free_entropy). The thermodynamic driving forces for
the isothermal diffusion are antigradients of chemical potentials,     &#x2212;
( 1  /  T )  &#x2207;  &#x03BC;  j     {\displaystyle -(1/T)\,\nabla \mu _{j}}
[{\displaystyle -(1/T)\,\nabla \mu _{j}}], and the matrix of diffusion
coefficients is
          D  i k   =   1 T    &#x2211;  j &#x2265; 1    L  i j         &#x2202;
      &#x03BC;  j   ( n , T )   &#x2202;  n  k      |   n =  n  &#x2217;
      {\displaystyle D_{ik}={\frac {1}{T}}\sum _{j\geq 1}L_{ij}\left.{\frac
      {\partial \mu _{j}(n,T)}{\partial n_{k}}}\right|_{n=n^{*}}}  [
      {\displaystyle D_{ik}={\frac {1}{T}}\sum _{j\geq 1}L_{ij}\left.{\frac
      {\partial \mu _{j}(n,T)}{\partial n_{k}}}\right|_{n=n^{*}}}]
(i,k > 0).
There is intrinsic arbitrariness in the definition of the thermodynamic forces
and kinetic coefficients because they are not measurable separately and only
their combinations      &#x2211;  j    L  i j    X  j     {\displaystyle \sum _
{j}L_{ij}X_{j}}  [\sum_j L_{ij}X_j] can be measured. For example, in the
original work of Onsager[11] the thermodynamic forces include additional
multiplier T, whereas in the Course_of_Theoretical_Physics[12] this multiplier
is omitted but the sign of the thermodynamic forces is opposite. All these
changes are supplemented by the corresponding changes in the coefficients and
do not affect the measurable quantities.
**** Nondiagonal diffusion must be nonlinear[edit] ****
The formalism of linear irreversible thermodynamics (Onsager) generates the
systems of linear diffusion equations in the form
            &#x2202;  c  i     &#x2202; t    =  &#x2211;  j    D  i j
      &#x0394;  c  j   .   {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial c_{i}}{\partial
      t}}=\sum _{j}D_{ij}\,\Delta c_{j}.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial c_
      {i}}{\partial t}}=\sum _{j}D_{ij}\,\Delta c_{j}.}]
If the matrix of diffusion coefficients is diagonal, then this system of
equations is just a collection of decoupled Fick's equations for various
components. Assume that diffusion is non-diagonal, for example,      D  12
&#x2260; 0   {\displaystyle D_{12}\neq 0}  [{\displaystyle D_{12}\neq 0}], and
consider the state with      c  2   = &#x22EF; =  c  n   = 0   {\displaystyle
c_{2}=\cdots =c_{n}=0}  [{\displaystyle c_{2}=\cdots =c_{n}=0}]. At this state,
&#x2202;  c  2    /  &#x2202; t =  D  12    &#x0394;  c  1     {\displaystyle
\partial c_{2}/\partial t=D_{12}\,\Delta c_{1}}  [{\displaystyle \partial c_
{2}/\partial t=D_{12}\,\Delta c_{1}}]. If      D  12    &#x0394;  c  1   ( x )
< 0   {\displaystyle D_{12}\,\Delta c_{1}(x)<0}  [{\displaystyle D_{12}\,\Delta
c_{1}(x)<0}] at some points, then      c  2   ( x )   {\displaystyle c_{2}(x)}
[c_{2}(x)] becomes negative at these points in a short time. Therefore, linear
non-diagonal diffusion does not preserve positivity of concentrations. Non-
diagonal equations of multicomponent diffusion must be non-linear.[10]
**** Einstein's mobility and Teorell formula[edit] ****
The Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory) connects the diffusion coefficient and
the mobility (the ratio of the particle's terminal drift_velocity to an applied
force)[13]
         D =    &#x03BC;   k  B   T  q   ,   {\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu \,k_
      {\text{B}}T}{q}},}  [{\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu \,k_{\text{B}}T}{q}},}]
where D is the diffusion_constant, Î¼ is the "mobility", kB is Boltzmann's
constant, T is the absolute_temperature, and q is the elementary_charge i.e.
charge of one electron.
Below, to combine in the same formula the chemical potential Î¼ and the
mobility, we use for mobility the notation       m     {\displaystyle
{\mathfrak {m}}}  [{\mathfrak {m}}].
The mobility-based approach was further applied by T. Teorell.[14] In 1935, he
studied the diffusion of ions through a membrane. He formulated the essence of
his approach in the formula:
      the flux is equal to mobility Ã concentration Ã force per gram-ion.
This is the so-called Teorell formula. The term "gram-ion" ("gram-particle") is
used for a quantity of a substance that contains Avogadro's_number of ions
(particles). The common modern term is mole.
The force under isothermal conditions consists of two parts:
   1. Diffusion force caused by concentration gradient:     &#x2212; R T   1 n
      &#x2207; n = &#x2212; R T  &#x2207; ( ln &#x2061; ( n  /   n  eq   ) )
      {\displaystyle -RT{\frac {1}{n}}\,\nabla n=-RT\,\nabla (\ln(n/n^{\text
      {eq}}))}  [{\displaystyle -RT{\frac {1}{n}}\,\nabla n=-RT\,\nabla (\ln(n/
      n^{\text{eq}}))}].
   2. Electrostatic force caused by electric potential gradient:     q
      &#x2207; &#x03C6;   {\displaystyle q\,\nabla \varphi }  [{\displaystyle
      q\,\nabla \varphi }].
Here R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the
concentration, the equilibrium concentration is marked by a superscript "eq", q
is the charge and Ï is the electric potential.
The simple but crucial difference between the Teorell formula and the Onsager
laws is the concentration factor in the Teorell expression for the flux. In the
EinsteinâTeorell approach, If for the finite force the concentration tends to
zero then the flux also tends to zero, whereas the Onsager equations violate
this simple and physically obvious rule.
The general formulation of the Teorell formula for non-perfect systems under
isothermal conditions is[10]
          J  =   m   exp &#x2061;  (    &#x03BC; &#x2212;  &#x03BC;  0     R T
      )  ( &#x2212; &#x2207; &#x03BC; + (  external force per mole  ) ) ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} ={\mathfrak {m}}\exp \left({\frac {\mu -\mu _
      {0}}{RT}}\right)(-\nabla \mu +({\text{external force per mole}})),}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} ={\mathfrak {m}}\exp \left({\frac {\mu -\mu _
      {0}}{RT}}\right)(-\nabla \mu +({\text{external force per mole}})),}]
where Î¼ is the chemical_potential, Î¼0 is the standard value of the chemical
potential. The expression     a = exp &#x2061;  (    &#x03BC; &#x2212;
&#x03BC;  0     R T    )    {\displaystyle a=\exp \left({\frac {\mu -\mu _{0}}
{RT}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle a=\exp \left({\frac {\mu -\mu _{0}}
{RT}}\right)}] is the so-called activity. It measures the "effective
concentration" of a species in a non-ideal mixture. In this notation, the
Teorell formula for the flux has a very simple form[10]
          J  =   m   a ( &#x2212; &#x2207; &#x03BC; + (  external force per
      mole  ) ) .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} ={\mathfrak {m}}a(-\nabla \mu +(
      {\text{external force per mole}})).}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =
      {\mathfrak {m}}a(-\nabla \mu +({\text{external force per mole}})).}]
The standard derivation of the activity includes a normalization factor and for
small concentrations     a = n  /   n  &#x2296;   + o ( n  /   n  &#x2296;   )
{\displaystyle a=n/n^{\ominus }+o(n/n^{\ominus })}  [{\displaystyle a=n/n^
{\ominus }+o(n/n^{\ominus })}], where      n  &#x2296;     {\displaystyle n^
{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle n^{\ominus }}] is the standard concentration.
Therefore, this formula for the flux describes the flux of the normalized
dimensionless quantity     n  /   n  &#x2296;     {\displaystyle n/n^{\ominus
}}  [{\displaystyle n/n^{\ominus }}]:
            &#x2202; ( n  /   n  &#x2296;   )   &#x2202; t    = &#x2207;
      &#x22C5; [   m   a ( &#x2207; &#x03BC; &#x2212; (  external force per
      mole  ) ) ] .   {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial (n/n^{\ominus })}
      {\partial t}}=\nabla \cdot [{\mathfrak {m}}a(\nabla \mu -({\text{external
      force per mole}}))].}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial (n/n^{\ominus })}
      {\partial t}}=\nabla \cdot [{\mathfrak {m}}a(\nabla \mu -({\text{external
      force per mole}}))].}]
**** Fluctuation-dissipation theorem[edit] ****
Fluctuation-dissipation_theorem based on the Langevin_equation is developed to
extend the Einstein model to the ballistic time scale.[15] According to
Langevin, the equation is based on Newton's second law of motion as
         m     d  2   x   d  t  2      = &#x2212;    d x   &#x03BC; d t    + F
      ( t )   {\displaystyle m{\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=-{\frac {dx}{\mu dt}}+F
      (t)}  [{\displaystyle m{\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=-{\frac {dx}{\mu dt}}+F
      (t)}]
where
    * x is the dimension.
    * Î¼ is the mobility of the particle in the fluid or gas, which can be
      calculated using the Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory).
    * m is the mass of the particle.
    * F is the random force applied to the particle.
    * t is time.
Solving this equation, one obtained the time-dependent diffusion constant in
the long-time limit and when the particle is significantly denser than the
surrounding fluid,[15]
         D ( t ) = &#x03BC;   k   B    T ( 1 &#x2212;  e  &#x2212; t  /  ( m
      &#x03BC; )   )   {\displaystyle D(t)=\mu \,k_{\rm {B}}T(1-e^{-t/(m\mu
      )})}  [{\displaystyle D(t)=\mu \,k_{\rm {B}}T(1-e^{-t/(m\mu )})}]
where
    * kB is Boltzmann's_constant;
    * T is the absolute_temperature.
    * Î¼ is the mobility of the particle in the fluid or gas, which can be
      calculated using the Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory).
    * m is the mass of the particle.
    * t is time.
*** Teorell formula for multicomponent diffusion[edit] ***
The Teorell formula with combination of Onsager's definition of the diffusion
force gives
           J   i   =    m  i      a  i    &#x2211;  j    L  i j    X  j   ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{i}={\mathfrak {m_{i}}}a_{i}\sum _{j}L_{ij}X_
      {j},}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{i}={\mathfrak {m_{i}}}a_{i}\sum _
      {j}L_{ij}X_{j},}]
where        m  i       {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {m_{i}}}}  [\mathfrak{m_i}]
is the mobility of the ith component,      a  i     {\displaystyle a_{i}}  [a_
{i}] is its activity,      L  i j     {\displaystyle L_{ij}}  [L_{ij}] is the
matrix of the coefficients,      X  j     {\displaystyle X_{j}}  [X_{j}] is the
thermodynamic diffusion force,      X  j   = &#x2212; &#x2207;    &#x03BC;  j
T     {\displaystyle X_{j}=-\nabla {\frac {\mu _{j}}{T}}}  [{\displaystyle X_
{j}=-\nabla {\frac {\mu _{j}}{T}}}]. For the isothermal perfect systems,      X
j   = &#x2212; R    &#x2207;  n  j     n  j       {\displaystyle X_{j}=-R{\frac
{\nabla n_{j}}{n_{j}}}}  [{\displaystyle X_{j}=-R{\frac {\nabla n_{j}}{n_
{j}}}}]. Therefore, the EinsteinâTeorell approach gives the following
multicomponent generalization of the Fick's law for multicomponent diffusion:
            &#x2202;  n  i     &#x2202; t    =  &#x2211;  j   &#x2207; &#x22C5;
      (   D  i j      n  i    n  j     &#x2207;  n  j    )  ,   {\displaystyle
      {\frac {\partial n_{i}}{\partial t}}=\sum _{j}\nabla \cdot \left(D_{ij}
      {\frac {n_{i}}{n_{j}}}\nabla n_{j}\right),}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {\partial n_{i}}{\partial t}}=\sum _{j}\nabla \cdot \left(D_{ij}{\frac
      {n_{i}}{n_{j}}}\nabla n_{j}\right),}]
where      D  i j     {\displaystyle D_{ij}}  [D_{ij}] is the matrix of
coefficients. The ChapmanâEnskog_formulas_for_diffusion_in_gases include
exactly the same terms. Earlier, such terms were introduced in the
MaxwellâStefan_diffusion equation.
**** Jumps on the surface and in solids[edit] ****
Diffusion in the monolayer: oscillations near temporary equilibrium positions
and jumps to the nearest free places.
Diffusion_of_reagents_on_the_surface of a catalyst may play an important role
in heterogeneous catalysis. The model of diffusion in the ideal monolayer is
based on the jumps of the reagents on the nearest free places. This model was
used for CO on Pt oxidation under low gas pressure.
The system includes several reagents      A  1   ,  A  2   , &#x2026; ,  A  m
{\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},\ldots ,A_{m}}  [{\displaystyle A_{1},A_{2},\ldots
,A_{m}}] on the surface. Their surface concentrations are      c  1   ,  c  2
, &#x2026; ,  c  m   .   {\displaystyle c_{1},c_{2},\ldots ,c_{m}.}  [
{\displaystyle c_{1},c_{2},\ldots ,c_{m}.}] The surface is a lattice of the
adsorption places. Each reagent molecule fills a place on the surface. Some of
the places are free. The concentration of the free places is     z =  c  0
{\displaystyle z=c_{0}}  [z=c_0]. The sum of all      c  i     {\displaystyle
c_{i}}  [c_{i}] (including free places) is constant, the density of adsorption
places b.
The jump model gives for the diffusion flux of      A  i     {\displaystyle A_
{i}}  [A_{i}] (i = 1, ..., n):
           J   i   = &#x2212;  D  i   [ z  &#x2207;  c  i   &#x2212;  c  i
      &#x2207; z ]  .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{i}=-D_{i}[z\,\nabla c_{i}-
      c_{i}\nabla z]\,.}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{i}=-D_{i}[z\,\nabla c_
      {i}-c_{i}\nabla z]\,.}]
The corresponding diffusion equation is:[10]
            &#x2202;  c  i     &#x2202; t    = &#x2212; div &#x2061;   J   i
      =  D  i   [ z  &#x0394;  c  i   &#x2212;  c  i    &#x0394; z ]  .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial c_{i}}{\partial t}}=-\operatorname {div}
      \mathbf {J} _{i}=D_{i}[z\,\Delta c_{i}-c_{i}\,\Delta z]\,.}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial c_{i}}{\partial t}}=-\operatorname {div}
      \mathbf {J} _{i}=D_{i}[z\,\Delta c_{i}-c_{i}\,\Delta z]\,.}]
Due to the conservation law,     z = b &#x2212;  &#x2211;  i = 1   n    c  i
,   {\displaystyle z=b-\sum _{i=1}^{n}c_{i}\,,}  [z=b-\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \, ,]
and we have the system of m diffusion equations. For one component we get
Fick's law and linear equations because     ( b &#x2212; c )  &#x2207; c
&#x2212; c  &#x2207; ( b &#x2212; c ) = b  &#x2207; c   {\displaystyle (b-
c)\,\nabla c-c\,\nabla (b-c)=b\,\nabla c}  [{\displaystyle (b-c)\,\nabla c-
c\,\nabla (b-c)=b\,\nabla c}]. For two and more components the equations are
nonlinear.
If all particles can exchange their positions with their closest neighbours
then a simple generalization gives
           J   i   = &#x2212;  &#x2211;  j    D  i j   [  c  j    &#x2207;  c
      i   &#x2212;  c  i    &#x2207;  c  j   ]   {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _
      {i}=-\sum _{j}D_{ij}[c_{j}\,\nabla c_{i}-c_{i}\,\nabla c_{j}]}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{i}=-\sum _{j}D_{ij}[c_{j}\,\nabla c_{i}-c_
      {i}\,\nabla c_{j}]}]
            &#x2202;  c  i     &#x2202; t    =  &#x2211;  j    D  i j   [  c  j
      &#x0394;  c  i   &#x2212;  c  i    &#x0394;  c  j   ]   {\displaystyle
      {\frac {\partial c_{i}}{\partial t}}=\sum _{j}D_{ij}[c_{j}\,\Delta c_{i}-
      c_{i}\,\Delta c_{j}]}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial c_{i}}{\partial
      t}}=\sum _{j}D_{ij}[c_{j}\,\Delta c_{i}-c_{i}\,\Delta c_{j}]}]
where      D  i j   =  D  j i   &#x2265; 0   {\displaystyle D_{ij}=D_{ji}\geq
0}  [D_{ij} = D_{ji} \geq 0] is a symmetric matrix of coefficients that
characterize the intensities of jumps. The free places (vacancies) should be
considered as special "particles" with concentration      c  0
{\displaystyle c_{0}}  [c_{0}].
Various versions of these jump models are also suitable for simple diffusion
mechanisms in solids.
**** Diffusion in porous media[edit] ****
For diffusion in porous media the basic equations are:[16]
          J  = &#x2212; &#x03D5; D  &#x2207;  n  m     {\displaystyle \mathbf
      {J} =-\phi D\,\nabla n^{m}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =-\phi D\,\nabla
      n^{m}}]
            &#x2202; n   &#x2202; t    = D  &#x0394;  n  m    ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial n}{\partial t}}=D\,\Delta n^{m}\,,}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial n}{\partial t}}=D\,\Delta n^{m}\,,}]
where D is the diffusion coefficient, Î¦ is porosity, n is the concentration,
m > 0 (usually m > 1, the case m = 1 corresponds to Fick's law).
Care must be taken to properly account for the porosity (Î¦) of the porous
medium in both the flux terms and the accumulation terms[17]. For example, as
the porosity goes to zero, the molar flux in the porous medium goes to zero for
a given concentration gradient. Upon applying the divergence of the flux, the
porosity terms cancel out and the second equation above is formed.
For diffusion of gases in porous media this equation is the formalization of
Darcy's_law: the volumetric_flux of a gas in the porous media is
         q = &#x2212;   k &#x03BC;    &#x2207; p   {\displaystyle q=-{\frac {k}
      {\mu }}\,\nabla p}  [{\displaystyle q=-{\frac {k}{\mu }}\,\nabla p}]
where k is the permeability of the medium, Î¼ is the viscosity and p is the
pressure.
The advective molar flux is given as
J = nq
and for     p &#x223C;  n  &#x03B3;     {\displaystyle p\sim n^{\gamma }}  [
{\displaystyle p\sim n^{\gamma }}] Darcy's law gives the equation of diffusion
in porous media with m = Î³ + 1.
In porous media, the average linear velocity (Î½), is related to the volumetric
flux as:
   &#x03C5; = q  /  &#x03D5;   {\displaystyle \upsilon =q/\phi }  [
{\displaystyle \upsilon =q/\phi }]
Combining the advective molar flux with the diffusive flux gives the advection
dispersion equation
      &#x2202; n   &#x2202; t    = D  &#x0394;  n  m   &#xA0; &#x2212; &#x03BD;
&#x22C5; &#x2207;  n  m   ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial n}{\partial
t}}=D\,\Delta n^{m}\ -\nu \cdot \nabla n^{m},}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
{\partial n}{\partial t}}=D\,\Delta n^{m}\ -\nu \cdot \nabla n^{m},}]

For underground water infiltration, the Boussinesq_approximation gives the same
equation with m = 2.
For plasma with the high level of radiation, the ZeldovichâRaizer equation
gives m > 4 for the heat transfer.
***** Diffusion in physics[edit] *****
**** Elementary theory of diffusion coefficient in gases[edit] ****
Random collisions of particles in a gas.
The diffusion coefficient     D   {\displaystyle D}  [D] is the coefficient in
the Fick's_first_law     J = &#x2212; D  &#x2202; n  /  &#x2202; x
{\displaystyle J=-D\,\partial n/\partial x}  [{\displaystyle J=-D\,\partial n/
\partial x}], where J is the diffusion flux (amount_of_substance) per unit area
per unit time, n (for ideal mixtures) is the concentration, x is the position
[length].
Consider two gases with molecules of the same diameter d and mass m (self-
diffusion). In this case, the elementary mean free path theory of diffusion
gives for the diffusion coefficient
         D =   1 3   &#x2113;  v  T   =   2 3       k   B    3     &#x03C0;  3
      m        T  3  /  2    P  d  2       ,   {\displaystyle D={\frac {1}
      {3}}\ell v_{T}={\frac {2}{3}}{\sqrt {\frac {k_{\rm {B}}^{3}}{\pi ^{3}m}}}
      {\frac {T^{3/2}}{Pd^{2}}}\,,}  [{\displaystyle D={\frac {1}{3}}\ell v_
      {T}={\frac {2}{3}}{\sqrt {\frac {k_{\rm {B}}^{3}}{\pi ^{3}m}}}{\frac {T^
      {3/2}}{Pd^{2}}}\,,}]
where kB is the Boltzmann_constant, T is the temperature, P is the pressure,
&#x2113;   {\displaystyle \ell }  [\ell ] is the mean_free_path, and vT is the
mean thermal speed:
         &#x2113; =     k   B    T     2   &#x03C0;  d  2   P     ,     v  T
      =     8  k   B    T   &#x03C0; m      .   {\displaystyle \ell ={\frac {k_
      {\rm {B}}T}{{\sqrt {2}}\pi d^{2}P}}\,,\;\;\;v_{T}={\sqrt {\frac {8k_{\rm
      {B}}T}{\pi m}}}\,.}  [\ell = \frac{k_{\rm B}T}{\sqrt 2 \pi d^2 P}\, ,
      \;\;\; v_T=\sqrt{\frac{8k_{\rm B}T}{\pi m}}\, .]
We can see that the diffusion coefficient in the mean free path approximation
grows with T as T3/2 and decreases with P as 1/P. If we use for P the ideal_gas
law P = RnT with the total concentration n, then we can see that for given
concentration n the diffusion coefficient grows with T as T1/2 and for given
temperature it decreases with the total concentration as 1/n.
For two different gases, A and B, with molecular masses mA, mB and molecular
diameters dA, dB, the mean free path estimate of the diffusion coefficient of A
in B and B in A is:
          D   A B    =   2 3       k   B    3    &#x03C0;  3          1  2  m
      A       +   1  2  m   B            4  T  3  /  2     P (  d   A    +  d
      B     )  2       ,   {\displaystyle D_{\rm {AB}}={\frac {2}{3}}{\sqrt
      {\frac {k_{\rm {B}}^{3}}{\pi ^{3}}}}{\sqrt {{\frac {1}{2m_{\rm {A}}}}+
      {\frac {1}{2m_{\rm {B}}}}}}{\frac {4T^{3/2}}{P(d_{\rm {A}}+d_{\rm {B}})^
      {2}}}\,,}  [D_{\rm AB}=\frac{2}{3}\sqrt{\frac{k_{\rm B}^3}{\pi^3}}\sqrt
      {\frac{1}{2m_{\rm A}}+\frac{1}{2m_{\rm B}}}\frac{4T^{3/2}}{P(d_{\rm A}+d_
      {\rm B})^2}\, ,]
**** The theory of diffusion in gases based on Boltzmann's equation[edit] ****
In Boltzmann's kinetics of the mixture of gases, each gas has its own
distribution function,      f  i   ( x , c , t )   {\displaystyle f_{i}(x,c,t)}
[f_i(x,c,t)], where t is the time moment, x is position and c is velocity of
molecule of the ith component of the mixture. Each component has its mean
velocity      C  i   ( x , t ) =   1  n  i      &#x222B;  c   c f ( x , c , t )
d c   {\displaystyle C_{i}(x,t)={\frac {1}{n_{i}}}\int _{c}cf(x,c,t)\,dc}  [C_i
(x,t)=\frac{1}{n_i}\int_c c f(x,c,t) \, dc]. If the velocities      C  i   ( x
, t )   {\displaystyle C_{i}(x,t)}  [C_i(x,t)] do not coincide then there
exists diffusion.
In the ChapmanâEnskog approximation, all the distribution functions are
expressed through the densities of the conserved quantities:[8]
    * individual concentrations of particles,      n  i   ( x , t ) =  &#x222B;
      c    f  i   ( x , c , t )  d c   {\displaystyle n_{i}(x,t)=\int _{c}f_{i}
      (x,c,t)\,dc}  [n_i(x,t)=\int_c f_i(x,c,t)\, dc] (particles per volume),
    * density of momentum      &#x2211;  i    m  i    n  i    C  i   ( x , t )
      {\displaystyle \sum _{i}m_{i}n_{i}C_{i}(x,t)}  [\sum_i m_i n_i C_i(x,t)]
      (mi is the ith particle mass),
    * density of kinetic energy

is the thermodiffusion ratio.
The coefficient D12 is positive. This is the diffusion coefficient. Four terms
in the formula for C1-C2 describe four main effects in the diffusion of gases:
   1.    &#x2207;   (    n  1   n   )    {\displaystyle \nabla \,\left({\frac
      {n_{1}}{n}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle \nabla \,\left({\frac {n_{1}}
      {n}}\right)}] describes the flux of the first component from the areas
      with the high ratio n1/n to the areas with lower values of this ratio
      (and, analogously the flux of the second component from high n2/n to low
      n2/n because n2/n = 1 â n1/n);
   2.        n  1    n  2   (  m  2   &#x2212;  m  1   )   n (  m  1    n  1
      +  m  2    n  2   )    &#x2207; P   {\displaystyle {\frac {n_{1}n_{2}(m_
      {2}-m_{1})}{n(m_{1}n_{1}+m_{2}n_{2})}}\nabla P}  [\frac{n_1n_2 (m_2-m_1)}
      {n (m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}\nabla P] describes the flux of the heavier molecules
      to the areas with higher pressure and the lighter molecules to the areas
      with lower pressure, this is barodiffusion;
   3.        m  1    n  1    m  2    n  2     P (  m  1    n  1   +  m  2    n
      2   )    (  F  1   &#x2212;  F  2   )   {\displaystyle {\frac {m_{1}n_
      {1}m_{2}n_{2}}{P(m_{1}n_{1}+m_{2}n_{2})}}(F_{1}-F_{2})}  [\frac
      {m_1n_1m_2n_2}{P(m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}(F_1-F_2)] describes diffusion caused by
      the difference of the forces applied to molecules of different types. For
      example, in the Earth's gravitational field, the heavier molecules should
      go down, or in electric field the charged molecules should move, until
      this effect is not equilibrated by the sum of other terms. This effect
      should not be confused with barodiffusion caused by the pressure
      gradient.
   4.     k  T     1 T   &#x2207; T   {\displaystyle k_{T}{\frac {1}{T}}\nabla
      T}  [k_T \frac{1}{T}\nabla T] describes thermodiffusion, the diffusion
      flux caused by the temperature gradient.
All these effects are called diffusion because they describe the differences
between velocities of different components in the mixture. Therefore, these
effects cannot be described as a bulk transport and differ from advection or
convection.

The number      A  1   (  &#x03BD;  )   {\displaystyle A_{1}({\nu })}  [A_1(
{\nu})] is defined by quadratures (formulas (3.7), (3.9), Ch. 10 of the
classical Chapman and Cowling book[8])
We can see that the dependence on T for the rigid spheres is the same as for
the simple mean free path theory but for the power repulsion laws the exponent
is different. Dependence on a total concentration n for a given temperature has
always the same character, 1/n.
In applications to gas dynamics, the diffusion flux and the bulk flow should be
joined in one system of transport equations. The bulk flow describes the mass
transfer. Its velocity V is the mass average velocity. It is defined through
the momentum density and the mass concentrations:
         V =     &#x2211;  i    &#x03C1;  i    C  i    &#x03C1;    .
      {\displaystyle V={\frac {\sum _{i}\rho _{i}C_{i}}{\rho }}\,.}  [
      {\displaystyle V={\frac {\sum _{i}\rho _{i}C_{i}}{\rho }}\,.}]
where      &#x03C1;  i   =  m  i    n  i     {\displaystyle \rho _{i}=m_{i}n_
{i}}  [\rho_i =m_i n_i] is the mass concentration of the ith species,
&#x03C1; =  &#x2211;  i    &#x03C1;  i     {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}\rho _
{i}}  [\rho=\sum_i \rho_i] is the mass density.
By definition, the diffusion velocity of the ith component is      v  i   =  C
i   &#x2212; V   {\displaystyle v_{i}=C_{i}-V}  [v_i=C_i-V],      &#x2211;  i
&#x03C1;  i    v  i   = 0   {\displaystyle \sum _{i}\rho _{i}v_{i}=0}  [\sum_i
\rho_i v_i=0]. The mass transfer of the ith component is described by the
continuity_equation
            &#x2202;  &#x03C1;  i     &#x2202; t    + &#x2207; (  &#x03C1;  i
      V ) + &#x2207; (  &#x03C1;  i    v  i   ) =  W  i    ,   {\displaystyle
      {\frac {\partial \rho _{i}}{\partial t}}+\nabla (\rho _{i}V)+\nabla (\rho

      {\partial t}}+\nabla (\rho _{i}V)+\nabla (\rho _{i}v_{i})=W_{i}\,,}]
where      W  i     {\displaystyle W_{i}}  [W_{i}] is the net mass production
rate in chemical reactions,      &#x2211;  i    W  i   = 0   {\displaystyle
\sum _{i}W_{i}=0}  [\sum_i W_i= 0].
In these equations, the term     &#x2207; (  &#x03C1;  i   V )   {\displaystyle
\nabla (\rho _{i}V)}  [\nabla(\rho_i V)] describes advection of the ith
component and the term     &#x2207; (  &#x03C1;  i    v  i   )   {\displaystyle
\nabla (\rho _{i}v_{i})}  [\nabla (\rho_i v_i)] represents diffusion of this
component.
In 1948, Wendell_H._Furry proposed to use the form of the diffusion rates found
in kinetic theory as a framework for the new phenomenological approach to
diffusion in gases. This approach was developed further by F.A. Williams and
S.H. Lam.[18] For the diffusion velocities in multicomponent gases (N
components) they used
          v  i   = &#x2212;  (   &#x2211;  j = 1   N    D  i j     d   j   +  D

      \mathbf {d} _{j}=\nabla X_{j}+(X_{j}-Y_{j})\,\nabla (\ln P)+\mathbf {g} _
      {j}\,;}]
           g   j   =   &#x03C1; P    (   Y  j    &#x2211;  k = 1   N    Y  k

As carriers are generated (green:electrons and purple:holes) due to light
shining at the center of an intrinsic semiconductor, they diffuse towards two
ends. Electrons have higher diffusion constant than holes leading to fewer
excess electrons at the center as compared to holes.
**** Diffusion of electrons in solids[edit] ****
Main article: Diffusion_current
When the density of electrons in solids is not in equilibrium, diffusion of
electrons occurs. For example, when a bias is applied to two ends of a chunk of
semiconductor, or a light shines on one end (see right figure), electron
diffuse from high density regions (center) to low density regions (two ends),
forming a gradient of electron density. This process generates current,
referred to as diffusion_current.
Diffusion current can also be described by Fick's_first_law
         J = &#x2212; D  &#x2202; n  /  &#x2202; x  ,   {\displaystyle J=-
      D\,\partial n/\partial x\,,}  [{\displaystyle J=-D\,\partial n/\partial
      x\,,}]
where J is the diffusion current density (amount_of_substance) per unit area
per unit time, n (for ideal mixtures) is the electron density, x is the
position [length].
**** Diffusion in geophysics[edit] ****
Analytical and numerical models that solve the diffusion equation for different
initial and boundary conditions have been popular for studying a wide variety
of changes to the Earth's surface. Diffusion has been used extensively in
erosion studies of hillslope retreat, bluff erosion, fault scarp degradation,
wave-cut terrace/shoreline retreat, alluvial channel incision, coastal shelf
retreat, and delta progradation.[19] Although the Earth's surface is not
literally diffusing in many of these cases, the process of diffusion
effectively mimics the holistic changes that occur over decades to millennia.
Diffusion models may also be used to solve inverse boundary value problems in
which some information about the depositional environment is known from
paleoenvironmental reconstruction and the diffusion equation is used to figure
out the sediment influx and time series of landform changes.[20]
***** Random walk (random motion)[edit] *****
[File:Random motion.webm]Play_media
The apparent random motion of atoms, ions or molecules explained. Substances
appear to move randomly due to collisions with other substances. From the iBook
"Cell Membrane Transport", free license granted by IS3D, LLC, 2014.
One common misconception is that individual atoms, ions or molecules move
randomly, which they do not. In the animation on the right, the ion on in the
left panel has a ârandomâ motion, but this motion is not random as it is
the result of âcollisionsâ with other ions. As such, the movement of a
single atom, ion, or molecule within a mixture just appears random when viewed
in isolation. The movement of a substance within a mixture by ârandom walkâ
is governed by the kinetic energy within the system that can be affected by
changes in concentration, pressure or temperature.
**** Separation of diffusion from convection in gases[edit] ****
While Brownian motion of multi-molecular mesoscopic particles (like pollen
grains studied by Brown) is observable under an optical microscope, molecular
diffusion can only be probed in carefully controlled experimental conditions.
Since Graham experiments, it is well known that avoiding of convection is
necessary and this may be a non-trivial task.
Under normal conditions, molecular diffusion dominates only on length scales
between nanometer and millimeter. On larger length scales, transport in liquids
and gases is normally due to another transport_phenomenon, convection, and to
study diffusion on the larger scale, special efforts are needed.
Therefore, some often cited examples of diffusion are wrong: If cologne is
sprayed in one place, it can soon be smelled in the entire room, but a simple
calculation shows that this can't be due to diffusion. Convective motion
persists in the room because of the temperature [inhomogeneity]. If ink is
dropped in water, one usually observes an inhomogeneous evolution of the
spatial distribution, which clearly indicates convection (caused, in
particular, by this dropping).[citation_needed]
In contrast, heat_conduction through solid media is an everyday occurrence
(e.g. a metal spoon partly immersed in a hot liquid). This explains why the
diffusion of heat was explained mathematically before the diffusion of mass.
