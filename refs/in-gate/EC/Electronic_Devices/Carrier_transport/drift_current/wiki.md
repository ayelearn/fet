****** Drift current ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In condensed_matter_physics and electrochemistry, drift current is the electric
current, or movement of charge_carriers, which is due to the applied electric
field, often stated as the electromotive_force over a given distance. When an
electric field is applied across a semiconductor material, a current is
produced due to the flow of charge carriers.
The drift_velocity is the average velocity of the charge carriers in the drift
current. The drift velocity, and resulting current, is characterized by the
mobility; for details, see electron_mobility (for solids) or electrical
mobility (for a more general discussion).
See driftâdiffusion_equation for the way that the drift current, diffusion
current, and carrier_generation_and_recombination are combined into a single
equation.

***** Overview[edit] *****
Drift current is the electric_current caused by particles getting pulled by an
electric field. The term is most commonly used in the context of electrons and
holes in semiconductors, although the same concept also applies to metals,
electrolytes, and so on.
Drift current is caused by the electric_force: Charged particles get pushed by
an electric field. Electrons, being negatively charged, get pushed in the
opposite direction to the electric field, while holes get pushed in the same
direction as the electric field, but the resulting conventional_current points
in the same direction as the electric field in both cases.
If an electric field is applied to an electron in a vacuum, the electron will
accelerate faster and faster, in approximately a straight line. A drift current
looks very different than that up close. Typically, electrons are moving
randomly in all directions (Brownian_motion), frequently changing direction
when they collide with grain boundaries or other disturbances. Between
collisions, the electric field subtly accelerates them in one direction. So
over time, they move at the drift_velocity on average, but at any instant the
electrons are moving at the (typically much faster) thermal_velocity.
The amount of drift current depends on the concentration of charge carriers and
their mobility in the material or medium.
**** Drift current versus diffusion current[edit] ****

***** Drift current in a p-n junction diode[edit] *****
In a p-n_junction diode, electrons and holes are the minority charge carriers
in the p-region and the n-region, respectively. In an unbiased junction, due to
the diffusion of charge carriers, the diffusion current, which flows from the p
to n region, is exactly balanced by the equal and opposite drift current.[1] In
a biased p-n junction, the drift current is independent of the biasing, as the
number of minority carriers is independent of the biasing voltages. But as
minority charge carriers can be thermally generated, drift current is
temperature dependent.
When an electric field is applied across the semiconductor material, the charge
carriers attain a certain drift velocity . This combined effect of movement of
the charge carriers constitutes a current known as "drift current". Drift
current density due to the charge carriers such as free electrons and holes is
the current passing through a square centimeter area perpendicular to the
direction of flow.
(i) Drift current density Jn, due to free electrons is given by:
    J  n   = q n  &#x03BC;  n   E  ( A  /  c  m  2   )   {\displaystyle J_
{n}=qn\mu _{n}E\quad (A/cm^{2})}  [{\displaystyle J_{n}=qn\mu _{n}E\quad (A/cm^
{2})}]
(ii) Drift current density Jp, due to holes is given by:
    J  p   = q p  &#x03BC;  p   E  ( A  /  c  m  2   )   {\displaystyle J_
{p}=qp\mu _{p}E\quad (A/cm^{2})}  [{\displaystyle J_{p}=qp\mu _{p}E\quad (A/cm^
{2})}]
