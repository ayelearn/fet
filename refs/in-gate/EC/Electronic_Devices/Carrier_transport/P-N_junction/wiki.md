A pân junction. The circuit symbol is shown: the triangle corresponds to the
p side.
A pân junction is a boundary or interface between two types of semiconductor
materials, p-type and n-type, inside a single crystal of semiconductor. The "p"
(positive) side contains an excess of holes, while the "n" (negative) side
contains an excess of electrons in the outer shells of the electrically neutral
atoms there. This allows electrical current to pass through the junction only
in one direction. The p-n junction is created by doping, for example by ion
implantation, diffusion of dopants, or by epitaxy (growing a layer of crystal
doped with one type of dopant on top of a layer of crystal doped with another
type of dopant). If two separate pieces of material were used, this would
introduce a grain_boundary between the semiconductors that would severely
inhibit its utility by scattering the electrons and holes.[citation_needed]
pân junctions are elementary "building blocks" of semiconductor_electronic
devices such as diodes, transistors, solar_cells, LEDs, and integrated
circuits; they are the active sites where the electronic action of the device
takes place. For example, a common type of transistor, the bipolar_junction
transistor, consists of two pân junctions in series, in the form nâpân or
pânâp; while a diode can be made from a single p-n junction. A Schottky
junction is a special case of a pân junction, where metal serves the role of
the p-type semiconductor.

***** Properties[edit] *****

The pân junction possesses essential properties for modern electronics. A p-
doped semiconductor is relatively conductive. The same is true of an n-doped
semiconductor, but the junction between them can become depleted of charge
carriers, and hence non-conductive, depending on the relative voltages of the
two semiconductor regions. By manipulating this non-conductive layer, pân
junctions are commonly used as diodes: circuit elements that allow a flow of
electricity in one direction but not in the other (opposite) direction. Bias is
the application of a voltage across a pân junction; forward_bias is in the
direction of easy current flow, and reverse_bias is in the direction of little
or no current flow.
The forward-bias and the reverse-bias properties of the pân junction imply
that it can be used as a diode. A pân junction diode allows electric charges
to flow in one direction, but not in the opposite direction; negative charges
(electrons) can easily flow through the junction from n to p but not from p to
n, and the reverse is true for holes. When the pân junction is forward-
biased, electric charge flows freely due to reduced resistance of the pân
junction. When the pân junction is reverse-biased, however, the junction
barrier (and therefore resistance) becomes greater and charge flow is minimal.
**** Equilibrium (zero bias)[edit] ****
In a pân junction, without an external applied voltage, an equilibrium
condition is reached in which a potential_difference forms across the junction.
This potential difference is called built-in potential      V   b i
{\displaystyle V_{\rm {bi}}}  [V_{\rm bi}].

At the junction, the free electrons in the n-type are attracted to the positive
holes in the p-type. They diffuse into the p-type, combine with the holes, and
cancel each other out. In a similar way the positive holes in the p-type are
attracted to the free electrons in the n-type. The holes diffuse into the n-
type, combine with the free electrons, and cancel each other out. The
positively charged, donor, dopant atoms in the n-type are part of the crystal,
and cannot move. Thus, in the n-type, a region near the junction becomes
positively charged. The negatively charged, acceptor, dopant atoms in the p-
type are part of the crystal, and cannot move. Thus, in the p-type, a region
near the junction becomes negatively charged. The result is a region near the
junction that acts to repel the mobile charges away from the junction through
the electric field that these charged regions create. The regions near the
pân interface lose their neutrality and most of their mobile carriers,
forming the space_charge_region or depletion_layer (see figure_A).
Figure A. A pân junction in thermal equilibrium with zero-bias voltage
applied. Electron and hole concentration are reported with blue and red lines,
respectively. Gray regions are charge-neutral. Light-red zone is positively
charged. Light-blue zone is negatively charged. The electric field is shown on
the bottom, the electrostatic force on electrons and holes and the direction in
which the diffusion tends to move electrons and holes. (The log concentration
curves should actually be smoother with slope varying with field strength.)
The electric_field created by the space charge region opposes the diffusion
process for both electrons and holes. There are two concurrent phenomena: the
diffusion process that tends to generate more space charge, and the electric
field generated by the space charge that tends to counteract the diffusion. The
carrier concentration profile at equilibrium is shown in figure_A with blue and
red lines. Also shown are the two counterbalancing phenomena that establish
equilibrium.
Figure B. A pân junction in thermal equilibrium with zero-bias voltage
applied. Under the junction, plots for the charge density, the electric field,
and the voltage are reported. (The log concentration curves should actually be
smoother, like the voltage.)
The space_charge_region is a zone with a net charge provided by the fixed ions
(donors or acceptors) that have been left uncovered by majority_carrier
diffusion. When equilibrium is reached, the charge density is approximated by
the displayed step function. In fact, since the y-axis of figure A is log-
scale, the region is almost completely depleted of majority carriers (leaving a
charge density equal to the net doping level), and the edge between the space
charge region and the neutral region is quite sharp (see figure_B, Q(x) graph).
The space charge region has the same magnitude of charge on both sides of the
pân interfaces, thus it extends farther on the less doped side in this
example (the n side in figures A and B).
**** Forward bias[edit] ****
In forward bias, the p-type is connected with the positive terminal and the n-
type is connected with the negative terminal.
PN junction operation in forward-bias mode, showing reducing depletion width.
The panels show energy band diagram, electric field, and net charge density.
Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1e15/cm3 (0.00016C/cm3) doping level,
leading to built-in potential of ~0.59 V. Reducing depletion width can be
inferred from the shrinking charge profile, as fewer dopants are exposed with
increasing forward bias. Observe the different quasi-fermi_levels for
conduction band and valence band in n and p regions (red curves)
With a battery connected this way, the holes in the p-type region and the
electrons in the n-type region are pushed toward the junction and start to
neutralize the depletion zone, reducing its width. The positive potential
applied to the p-type material repels the holes, while the negative potential
applied to the n-type material repels the electrons. The change in potential
between the p side and the n side decreases or switches sign. With increasing
forward-bias voltage, the depletion zone eventually becomes thin enough that
the zone's electric field cannot counteract charge carrier motion across the
pân junction, which as a consequence reduces electrical resistance. Electrons
that cross the pân junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross
into the n-type material) diffuse into the nearby neutral region. The amount of
minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones determines the amount of current
that can flow through the diode.
Only majority_carriers (electrons in n-type material or holes in p-type) can
flow through a semiconductor for a macroscopic length. With this in mind,
consider the flow of electrons across the junction. The forward bias causes a
force on the electrons pushing them from the N side toward the P side. With
forward bias, the depletion region is narrow enough that electrons can cross
the junction and inject into the p-type material. However, they do not continue
to flow through the p-type material indefinitely, because it is energetically
favorable for them to recombine with holes. The average length an electron
travels through the p-type material before recombining is called the diffusion
length, and it is typically on the order of micrometers.[1]
Although the electrons penetrate only a short distance into the p-type
material, the electric current continues uninterrupted, because holes (the
majority carriers) begin to flow in the opposite direction. The total current
(the sum of the electron and hole currents) is constant in space, because any
variation would cause charge buildup over time (this is Kirchhoff's_current
law). The flow of holes from the p-type region into the n-type region is
exactly analogous to the flow of electrons from N to P (electrons and holes
swap roles and the signs of all currents and voltages are reversed).
Therefore, the macroscopic picture of the current flow through the diode
involves electrons flowing through the n-type region toward the junction, holes
flowing through the p-type region in the opposite direction toward the
junction, and the two species of carriers constantly recombining in the
vicinity of the junction. The electrons and holes travel in opposite
directions, but they also have opposite charges, so the overall current is in
the same direction on both sides of the diode, as required.
The Shockley_diode_equation models the forward-bias operational characteristics
of a pân junction outside the avalanche (reverse-biased conducting) region.
**** Reverse bias[edit] ****
A silicon pân junction in reverse bias.
Connecting the p-type region to the negative terminal of the battery and the n-
type region to the positive terminal corresponds to reverse bias. If a diode is
reverse-biased, the voltage at the cathode is comparatively higher than at the
anode. Therefore, very little current flows until the diode breaks down. The
connections are illustrated in the adjacent diagram.
Because the p-type material is now connected to the negative terminal of the
power supply, the 'holes' in the p-type material are pulled away from the
junction, leaving behind charged ions and causing the width of the depletion
region to increase. Likewise, because the n-type region is connected to the
positive terminal, the electrons are pulled away from the junction, with
similar effect. This increases the voltage barrier causing a high resistance to
the flow of charge carriers, thus allowing minimal electric current to cross
the pân junction. The increase in resistance of the pân junction results in
the junction behaving as an insulator.
The strength of the depletion zone electric field increases as the reverse-bias
voltage increases. Once the electric field intensity increases beyond a
critical level, the pân junction depletion zone breaks down and current
begins to flow, usually by either the Zener or the avalanche_breakdown
processes. Both of these breakdown processes are non-destructive and are
reversible, as long as the amount of current flowing does not reach levels that
cause the semiconductor material to overheat and cause thermal damage.
This effect is used to advantage in Zener_diode regulator circuits. Zener
diodes have a low breakdown_voltage. A standard value for breakdown voltage is
for instance 5.6 V. This means that the voltage at the cathode cannot be more
than about 5.6 V higher than the voltage at the anode (though there is a slight
rise with current), because the diode breaks down, and therefore conduct, if
the voltage gets any higher. This, in effect, limits the voltage over the
diode.
Another application of reverse biasing is Varicap diodes, where the width of
the depletion_zone (controlled with the reverse bias voltage) changes the
capacitance of the diode.

For a pân junction, letting      C  A   ( x )   {\displaystyle C_{A}(x)}
[ C_A(x) ] and      C  D   ( x )   {\displaystyle C_{D}(x)}  [ C_D(x) ] be the
concentrations of acceptor and donor atoms respectively, and letting      N  0
( x )   {\displaystyle N_{0}(x)}  [N_0(x) ] and      P  0   ( x )
{\displaystyle P_{0}(x)}  [P_0(x) ] be the equilibrium concentrations of

where     V   {\displaystyle V}  [V] is the electric_potential,     &#x03C1;
{\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is the charge_density,     &#x03B5;
{\displaystyle \varepsilon }  [\varepsilon ] is permittivity and     q
{\displaystyle q}  [q] is the magnitude of the electron charge. Letting      d

within the p-side, and letting      d  n     {\displaystyle d_{n}}  [d_n ] be
the width of the depletion region within the n-side, it must be that
    d  p    C  A   =  d  n    C  D     {\displaystyle d_{p}C_{A}=d_{n}C_{D}}
[d_pC_A=d_nC_D]
because the total charge on either side of the depletion region must cancel
out. Therefore, letting     D   {\displaystyle D}  [D] and     &#x0394; V

where      P  0   =  N  0   = 0   {\displaystyle P_{0}=N_{0}=0}  [P_0=N_0=0],
because we are in the depletion region. And thus, letting     d
{\displaystyle d}  [d] be the total width of the depletion region, we get
   d =      2 &#x03B5;  q       C  A   +  C  D      C  A    C  D      &#x0394;

{C_AC_D}\Delta V}]
   &#x0394; V   {\displaystyle \Delta V}  [\Delta V] can be written as
&#x0394;  V  0   + &#x0394;  V  ext     {\displaystyle \Delta V_{0}+\Delta V_
{\text{ext}}}  [\Delta V_0+\Delta V_\text{ext}], where we have broken up the
voltage difference into the equilibrium plus external components. The
equilibrium potential results from diffusion forces, and thus we can calculate
&#x0394;  V  0     {\displaystyle \Delta V_{0}}  [\Delta V_0] by implementing
the Einstein_relation and assuming the semiconductor is nondegenerate (i.e. the
product        P   0       N   0      {\displaystyle {{P}_{0}}{{N}_{0}}}  [{
{P}_{0}}{{N}_{0}}] is independent of the Fermi_energy):

\right)]
where T is the temperature of the semiconductor and k is Boltzmann_constant.[2]
**** Current across depletion region[edit] ****
The Shockley_ideal_diode_equation characterizes the current across a pân
junction as a function of external voltage and ambient conditions (temperature,
choice of semiconductor, etc.). To see how it can be derived, we must examine
the various reasons for current. The convention is that the forward (+)
direction be pointed against the diode's built-in potential gradient at
equilibrium.

In the above diagrams, contact between the metal wires and the semiconductor
material also creates metalâsemiconductor_junctions called Schottky_diodes.
In a simplified ideal situation a semiconductor diode would never function,
since it would be composed of several diodes connected back-to-front in series.
But, in practice, surface impurities within the part of the semiconductor that
touches the metal terminals greatly reduces the width of those depletion
layers, to such an extent that the metal-semiconductor junctions do not act as
diodes. These non-rectifying_junctions behave as ohmic_contacts regardless of
applied voltage polarity.
***** Manufacture[edit] *****
The p-n junction is created by doping, for example by ion_implantation,
diffusion of dopants, or by epitaxy (growing a layer of crystal doped with one
type of dopant on top of a layer of crystal doped with another type of dopant).
If two separate pieces of material were used, this would introduce a grain
boundary between the semiconductors that would severely inhibit its utility by
scattering the electrons and holes.[citation_needed]
***** History[edit] *****
The invention of the pân junction is usually attributed to American physicist
Russell_Ohl of Bell_Laboratories in 1939.[3] Two years later (1941), Vadim
Lashkaryov reported discovery of pân junctions in Cu2O and silver sulphide
photocells and selenium rectifiers.[4]
