Raman scattering or the Raman effect /ËrÉËmÉn/ is the inelastic_scattering
of a photon by molecules which are excited to higher energy levels. The effect
was discovered in 1928 by C._V._Raman and his student K._S._Krishnan in
liquids,[1] and independently by Grigory_Landsberg and Leonid_Mandelstam in
crystals.[2] The effect had been predicted theoretically by Adolf_Smekal in
1923.[3]
When photons are scattered by a material, most of them are elastically
scattered (Rayleigh_scattering), such that the scattered photons have the same
energy (frequency and wavelength) as the incident photons but different
direction. However, a small fraction of the scattered photons (approximately 1
in 10 million) are scattered inelastically, with the scattered photons having
an energy different from, and usually lower than, those of the incident
photonsâthese are Raman scattered photons.[4] Because of conservation_of
energy, the material either gains or loses energy in the process. Typically
this is vibrational energy and the incident photons are of visible light,
although rotational energy (if gas samples are used) and electronic energy
levels (if an X-ray source is used) may also be probed. The Raman effect forms
the basis for Raman_spectroscopy which is used by chemists and physicists to
gain information about materials.

***** History[edit] *****
The inelastic scattering of light was predicted by Adolf_Smekal in 1923[3] (and
in German-language literature it may be referred to as the Smekal-Raman-Effekt
[5]). In 1922, Indian physicist C._V._Raman published his work on the
"Molecular Diffraction of Light", the first of a series of investigations with
his collaborators that ultimately led to his discovery (on 28 February 1928) of
the radiation effect that bears his name. The Raman effect was first reported
by Raman and K._S._Krishnan,[1] and independently by Grigory_Landsberg and
Leonid_Mandelstam, on 21 February 1928. In the former Soviet Union, Raman's
contribution was always disputed; thus in Russian scientific literature this
effect is usually referred to as "combination scattering" or "combinatory
scattering". Raman received the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his work on the
scattering of light.[6]
Although modern Raman spectroscopy nearly always involves the use of lasers,
which were not available until more than three decades later, Raman and
Krishnan used a mercury_lamp and photographic_plates to record spectra.[7]

for analyzing the composition of liquids, gases, and solids.[8]
***** Description[edit] *****
**** Degrees of freedom[edit] ****
For any given chemical compound, there are a total of 3N degrees_of_freedom,
where N is the number of atoms in the compound. This number arises from the
ability of each atom in a molecule to move in three different directions (x, y,
and z).[9] When dealing with molecules, it is more common to consider the
movement of the molecule as a whole. Consequently, the 3N degrees of freedom
are partitioned into molecular translational, rotational, and vibrational
motion. Three of the degrees of freedom correspond to translational motion of
the molecule as a whole (along each of the three spatial dimensions).
Similarly, three degrees of freedom correspond to rotations of the molecule
about the     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x],     y   {\displaystyle y}  [y], and
z   {\displaystyle z}  [z]-axes. Linear_molecules only have two rotations
because rotations along the bond axis do not change the positions of the atoms
in the molecule. The remaining degrees of freedom correspond to molecular
vibrational modes. These modes include stretching and bending motions of the
chemical_bonds of the molecule. For a linear molecule, the number of
vibrational modes is:[9]
         3 N &#x2212; 3 &#x2212; 2 = 3 N &#x2212; 5   {\displaystyle 3N-3-2=3N-
      5}  [3N-3-2=3N-5]
whereas for a non-linear molecule the number of vibrational modes are
         3 N &#x2212; 6   {\displaystyle 3N-6}  [3N-6]
**** Molecular vibrations and infrared radiation[edit] ****
The frequencies of molecular vibrations range from less than 1012 to
approximately 1014 Hz. These frequencies correspond to radiation in the
infrared (IR) region of the electromagnetic_spectrum. At any given instant,
each molecule in a sample has a certain amount of vibrational energy. However,
the amount of vibrational energy that a molecule has continually changes due to
collisions and other interactions with other molecules in the sample.
At room temperature, most of the molecules will be in the lowest energy_state,
which is known as the ground_state. A few molecules will be in higher energy
states, which are known as excited states. The fraction of molecules occupying
a given vibrational mode at a given temperature can be calculated using the
Boltzmann_distribution. Performing such a calculation shows that, for
relatively low temperatures (such as those used for most routine spectroscopy),
most of the molecules occupy the ground vibrational state. Such a molecule can
be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a
photon of the appropriate energy. This is the mechanism by which IR
spectroscopy operates: infrared radiation is passed through the sample, and the
intensity of the transmitted light is compared with that of the incident light.
A reduction in intensity at a given wavelength of light indicates the
absorption of energy by a vibrational transition. The energy,     E
{\displaystyle E}  [E], of a photon is
         E = h &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle E=h\nu }  [E=h\nu ],
where     h   {\displaystyle h}  [h] is Planck's_constant and     &#x03BD;
{\displaystyle \nu }  [\nu ] is the frequency of the radiation. Thus, the
energy required for such a transition may be calculated if the frequency of the
incident radiation is known.
**** Raman scattering[edit] ****
It is also possible to observe molecular vibrations by an inelastic scattering
process. In inelastic (Raman) scattering, an absorbed photon is re-emitted with
lower energy; the difference in energy between the incident photons and
scattered photons corresponds to the energy required to excite a molecule to a
higher vibrational mode.
Typically, in Raman spectroscopy high intensity laser radiation with
wavelengths in either the visible or near-infrared regions of the spectrum is
passed through a sample. Photons from the laser beam produce an oscillating
polarization in the molecules, exciting them to a virtual_energy_state. The
oscillating polarization of the molecule can couple with other possible
polarizations of the molecule, including vibrational and electronic
excitations.[citation_needed] If the polarization in the molecule does not
couple to these other possible polarizations, then it will not change the
vibrational state that the molecule started in and the scattered photon will
have the same energy as the original photon.[citation_needed] This type of
scattering is known as Rayleigh_scattering.
When the polarization in the molecules couples to a vibrational state that is
higher in energy than the state they started in, then the original photon and
the scattered photon differ in energy by the amount required to vibrationally
excite the molecule. In perturbation_theory, the Raman effect corresponds to
the absorption and subsequent emission of a photon via an intermediate quantum
state of a material. The intermediate state can be either a "real", i.e.
stationary_state, or a virtual_state.
**** Stokes and anti-Stokes[edit] ****
The different possibilities of light scattering: Rayleigh scattering (no
exchange of energy: incident and scattered photons have the same energy),
Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule absorbs energy: scattered photon has
less energy than the incident photon) and anti-Stokes Raman scattering (atom or
molecule loses energy: scattered photon has more energy than the incident
photon)
The Raman interaction leads to two possible outcomes:
    * the material absorbs energy and the emitted photon has a lower energy
      than the incident photon. This outcome is labeled Stokes Raman scattering
      in honor of George_Stokes who showed in 1852 that fluorescence is due to
      light emission at longer_wavelength (now known to correspond to lower
      energy) than the absorbed incident light.
    * the material loses energy and the emitted photon has a higher energy than
      the absorbed photon. This outcome is labeled anti-Stokes Raman
      scattering.
The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photon corresponds to
the energy difference between two resonant states of the material and is
independent of the absolute energy of the photon.
The spectrum of the scattered photons is termed the Raman_spectrum. It shows
the intensity of the scattered light as a function of its frequency difference
ÎÎ½ to the incident photons. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-
Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around ÎÎ½=0. The frequency shifts are
symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same
upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will
typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states
of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In thermodynamic
equilibrium, the lower state will be more populated than the upper state.
Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the
upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction
(anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are
stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the
temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it.
**** Distinction from fluorescence[edit] ****
The Raman effect differs from the process of fluorescence in that it is a
scattering process. For fluorescence, the incident light is completely
absorbed, transferring the system to an excited_state. After a certain
resonance lifetime, the system de-excites to lower energy states via emission
of photons. The result of both processes is in essence the same: A photon with
a frequency different from that of the incident photon is produced and the
molecule is brought to a higher or lower energy_level. But the major difference
is that the Raman effect can take place for any frequency of incident light. In
contrast to the fluorescence effect, the Raman effect is therefore not a
resonant effect. In practice, this means that a fluorescence peak is anchored
at a specific frequency, whereas a Raman peak maintains a constant separation
from the excitation frequency.
**** Selection rules[edit] ****
A Raman transition from one state to another is allowed only if the molecular
polarizability of those states is different. For a vibration, this means that
the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the normal coordinate
associated to the vibration is non-zero:        &#x2202; &#x03B1;   &#x2202; Q
&#x2260; 0   {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \alpha }{\partial Q}}\neq 0}  [
{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \alpha }{\partial Q}}\neq 0}]. In general, a
normal mode is Raman active if it transforms with the same symmetry of the
quadratic forms (     x  2   ,  y  2   ,  z  2   , x y , x z , y z
{\displaystyle x^{2},y^{2},z^{2},xy,xz,yz}  [{\displaystyle x^{2},y^{2},z^
{2},xy,xz,yz}]), which can be verified from the character_table of the
molecule's symmetry_group.
The specific selection rules state that the allowed rotational transitions are
&#x0394; J = &#x00B1; 2   {\displaystyle \Delta J=\pm 2}  [{\displaystyle
\Delta J=\pm 2}], where     J   {\displaystyle J}  [J] is the rotational state.
The allowed vibrational transitions are     &#x0394; &#x03BD; = &#x00B1; 1
{\displaystyle \Delta \nu =\pm 1}  [{\displaystyle \Delta \nu =\pm 1}], where
&#x03BD;   {\displaystyle \nu }  [\nu ] is the vibrational state.
***** Stimulated Raman scattering and Raman amplification[edit] *****
The Raman-scattering process as described above takes place spontaneously;
i.e., in random time intervals, one of the many incoming photons is scattered
by the material. This process is thus called spontaneous Raman scattering.
On the other hand, stimulated Raman scattering can take place when some Stokes
photons have previously been generated by spontaneous Raman scattering (and
somehow forced to remain in the material), or when deliberately injecting
Stokes photons ("signal light") together with the original light ("pump
light"). In that case, the total Raman-scattering rate is increased beyond that
of spontaneous Raman scattering: pump photons are converted more rapidly into
additional Stokes photons. The more Stokes photons that are already present,
the faster more of them are added. Effectively, this amplifies the Stokes light
in the presence of the pump light, which is exploited in Raman_amplifiers and
Raman_lasers.
Stimulated Raman scattering is a nonlinear-optical effect. It can be described
using a third-order nonlinear_susceptibility      &#x03C7;  ( 3 )
{\displaystyle \chi ^{(3)}}  [\chi ^{(3)}].
**** Requirement for space-coherence[edit] ****
Suppose that the distance between two points A and B of an exciting beam is x.
Generally, as the exciting frequency is not equal to the scattered Raman
frequency, the corresponding relative wavelengths λ and λ' are not equal. Thus,
a phase-shift Θ = 2πx(1/λ â 1/λ') appears. For Θ = π, the scattered
amplitudes are opposite, so that the Raman scattered beam remains weak.
    * A crossing of the beams may limit the path x.
Several tricks may be used to get a larger amplitude:
    * In an optically anisotropic crystal, a light ray may have two modes of
      propagation with different polarizations and different indices of
      refraction. If energy may be transferred between these modes by a
      quadrupolar (Raman) resonance, phases remain coherent along the whole
      path, transfer of energy may be large. It is an Optical_parametric
      generation.
    * Light may be pulsed, so that beats do not appear. In Impulsive Stimulated
      Raman Scattering (ISRS),[10][11][12][13] the length of the pulses must be
      shorter than all relevant time constants.[14] Interference of Raman and
      incident lights is too short to allow beats, so that it produces a
      frequency shift roughly, in best conditions, inversely proportional to
      the cube of the pulse length.
In labs, femtosecond laser pulses must be used because the ISRS becomes very
weak if the pulses are too long. Thus ISRS cannot be observed using nanosecond
pulses making ordinary time-incoherent light.
***** Inverse Raman effect[edit] *****
The inverse Raman effect is a form of Raman scattering first noted by W. J.
Jones and B.P._Stoicheff. In some circumstances, Stokes scattering can exceed
anti-Stokes scattering; in these cases the continuum (on leaving the material)
is observed to have an absorption line (a dip in intensity) at Î½L+Î½M. This
phenomenon is referred to as the inverse Raman effect; the application of the
phenomenon is referred to as inverse Raman_spectroscopy, and a record of the
continuum is referred to as an inverse Raman spectrum.
In the original description of the inverse Raman effect,[15] the authors
discuss both absorption from a continuum of higher frequencies and absorption
from a continuum of lower frequencies. They note that absorption from a
continuum of lower frequencies will not be observed if the Raman frequency of
the material is vibrational in origin and if the material is in thermal
equilibrium.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Raman_spectroscopy employs the Raman effect for substances analysis. The
spectrum of the Raman-scattered light depends on the molecular constituents
present and their state, allowing the spectrum to be used for material
identification and analysis. Raman spectroscopy is used to analyze a wide range
of materials, including gases, liquids, and solids. Highly complex materials
such as biological organisms and human tissue[16] can also be analyzed by Raman
spectroscopy.
For solid materials, Raman scattering is used as a tool to detect high-
frequency phonon and magnon excitations.
Raman lidar is used in atmospheric physics to measure the atmospheric
extinction coefficient and the water vapour vertical distribution.
Stimulated Raman transitions are also widely used for manipulating a trapped
ion's energy levels, and thus basis qubit states.
Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine the force_constant and bond_length
for molecules that do not have an infrared absorption_spectrum.
Raman_amplification is used in optical_amplifiers.
The Raman effect is also involved in producing the appearance of the blue sky
(see Rayleigh_Scattering: 'Rayleigh scattering of molecular nitrogen and oxygen
in the atmosphere includes elastic scattering as well as the inelastic
contribution from rotational Raman scattering in air').
**** Supercontinuum generation[edit] ****
For high-intensity continuous wave (CW) lasers, SRS can be used to produce
broad bandwidth spectra. This process can also be seen as a special case of
four-wave_mixing, wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal
and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident
light by the phonon energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with
spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long
fibers, higher-order Raman spectra can be generated by using the Raman spectrum
as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with
decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial
spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or
even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since
this technology easily fits into the fast evolving fiber_laser field and there
is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e.,
broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and
spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.
