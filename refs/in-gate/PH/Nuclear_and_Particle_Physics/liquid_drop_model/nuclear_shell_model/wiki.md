In nuclear_physics and nuclear_chemistry, the nuclear shell model is a model_of
the atomic_nucleus which uses the Pauli_exclusion_principle to describe the
structure of the nucleus in terms of energy levels.[1] The first shell model
was proposed by Dmitry_Ivanenko (together with E. Gapon) in 1932. The model was
developed in 1949 following independent work by several physicists, most
notably Eugene_Paul_Wigner, Maria_Goeppert_Mayer and J._Hans_D._Jensen, who
shared the 1963 Nobel_Prize_in_Physics for their contributions.
The shell model is partly analogous to the atomic_shell_model which describes
the arrangement of electrons in an atom, in that a filled shell results in
greater stability. When adding nucleons (protons or neutrons) to a nucleus,
there are certain points where the binding_energy of the next nucleon is
significantly less than the last one. This observation, that there are certain
magic_numbers of nucleons: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126 which are more tightly
bound than the next higher number, is the origin of the shell model.
The shells for protons and for neutrons are independent of each other.
Therefore, "magic nuclei" exist in which one nucleon type or the other is at a
magic number, and "doubly_magic_nuclei", where both are. Due to some variations
in orbital filling, the upper magic numbers are 126 and, speculatively, 184 for
neutrons but only 114 for protons, playing a role in the search for the so-
called island_of_stability. Some semimagic numbers have been found, notably
ZÂ =Â 40 giving nuclear shell filling for the various elements; 16 may also be a
magic number.[2]
In order to get these numbers, the nuclear shell model starts from an average
potential with a shape something between the square_well and the harmonic
oscillator. To this potential a spin orbit term is added. Even so, the total
perturbation does not coincide with experiment, and an empirical spin orbit
coupling must be added with at least two or three different values of its
coupling constant, depending on the nuclei being studied.
Nevertheless, the magic numbers of nucleons, as well as other properties, can
be arrived at by approximating the model with a three-dimensional_harmonic
oscillator plus a spin-orbit_interaction. A more realistic but also complicated
potential is known as WoodsÃ¢Â€Â“Saxon_potential.

We can imagine ourselves building a nucleus by adding protons and neutrons.
These will always fill the lowest available level. Thus the first two protons
fill level zero, the next six protons fill level one, and so on. As with
electrons in the periodic_table, protons in the outermost shell will be
relatively loosely bound to the nucleus if there are only few protons in that
shell, because they are farthest from the center of the nucleus. Therefore,
nuclei which have a full outer proton shell will have a higher binding_energy
than other nuclei with a similar total number of protons. All this is true for
neutrons as well.
This means that the magic numbers are expected to be those in which all
occupied shells are full. We see that for the first two numbers we get 2 (level
0 full) and 8 (levels 0 and 1 full), in accord with experiment. However the
full set of magic numbers does not turn out correctly. These can be computed as
follows:
      In a three-dimensional_harmonic_oscillator the total degeneracy at level
      n is        ( n + 1 ) ( n + 2 )  2     {\displaystyle {(n+1)(n+2) \over
      2}}  [{(n+1)(n+2) \over 2}].
      Due to the spin, the degeneracy is doubled and is     ( n + 1 ) ( n + 2 )
      {\displaystyle (n+1)(n+2)}  [(n+1)(n+2)].
      Thus the magic numbers would be
                &#x2211;  n = 0   k   ( n + 1 ) ( n + 2 ) =    ( k + 1 ) ( k +
            2 ) ( k + 3 )  3     {\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{k}(n+1)(n+2)=
            {\frac {(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)}{3}}}  [{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{k}(n+1)
            (n+2)={\frac {(k+1)(k+2)(k+3)}{3}}}]
      for all integer k. This gives the following magic numbers:
      2,Â 8,Â 20,Â 40,Â 70,Â 112,Â ..., which agree with experiment only in the first
      three entries. These numbers are twice the tetrahedral_numbers
      (1,Â 4,Â 10,Â 20,Â 35,Â 56,Â ...) from the Pascal_Triangle.
In particular, the first six shells are:
    * level 0: 2 states (l = 0) = 2.
    * level 1: 6 states (l = 1) = 6.
    * level 2: 2 states (l = 0) + 10 states (l = 2) = 12.
    * level 3: 6 states (l = 1) + 14 states (l = 3) = 20.
    * level 4: 2 states (l = 0) + 10 states (l = 2) + 18 states (l = 4) = 30.
    * level 5: 6 states (l = 1) + 14 states (l = 3) + 22 states (l = 5) = 42.
where for every l there are 2l+1 different values of ml and 2 values of ms,
giving a total of 4l+2 states for every specific level.
These numbers are twice the values of triangular_numbers from the Pascal
Triangle: 1,Â 3,Â 6,Â 10,Â 15,Â 21,Â ....
**** Including a spin-orbit interaction[edit] ****
We next include a spin-orbit_interaction. First we have to describe the system
by the quantum_numbers j, mj and parity instead of l, ml and ms, as in the
hydrogen-like_atom. Since every even level includes only even values of l, it
includes only states of even (positive) parity. Similarly, every odd level
includes only states of odd (negative) parity. Thus we can ignore parity in
counting states. The first six shells, described by the new quantum numbers,
are
    * level 0 (n = 0): 2 states (j = &#x200b;1â„2). Even parity.
    * level 1 (n = 1): 2 states (j = &#x200b;1â„2) + 4 states (j = &#x200b;3â„2)
      = 6. Odd parity.
    * level 2 (n = 2): 2 states (j = &#x200b;1â„2) + 4 states (j = &#x200b;3â„2)
      + 6 states (j = &#x200b;5â„2) = 12. Even parity.
    * level 3 (n = 3): 2 states (j = &#x200b;1â„2) + 4 states (j = &#x200b;3â„2)
      + 6 states (j = &#x200b;5â„2) + 8 states (j = &#x200b;7â„2) = 20. Odd
      parity.
    * level 4 (n = 4): 2 states (j = &#x200b;1â„2) + 4 states (j = &#x200b;3â„2)
      + 6 states (j = &#x200b;5â„2) + 8 states (j = &#x200b;7â„2) + 10 states (j
      = &#x200b;9â„2) = 30. Even parity.
    * level 5 (n = 5): 2 states (j = &#x200b;1â„2) + 4 states (j = &#x200b;3â„2)
      + 6 states (j = &#x200b;5â„2) + 8 states (j = &#x200b;7â„2) + 10 states (j
      = &#x200b;9â„2) + 12 states (j = &#x200b;11â„2) = 42. Odd parity.
where for every j there are 2j+1 different states from different values of mj.
Due to the spin-orbit interaction the energies of states of the same level but
with different j will no longer be identical. This is because in the original
quantum numbers, when         s &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle
{\vec {s}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {s}}] is parallel to         l &#x2192;
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {l}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {l}}], the
interaction energy is positive; and in this case j = l + s = l + &#x200b;1â„2.
When         s &#x2192;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {s}}}
[\scriptstyle {\vec {s}}] is anti-parallel to         l &#x2192;
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {l}}}  [\scriptstyle {\vec {l}}] (i.e.
aligned oppositely), the interaction energy is negative, and in this case
j=lÃ¢ÂˆÂ’s=lÃ¢ÂˆÂ’&#x200b;1â„2. Furthermore, the strength of the interaction is
roughly proportional to l.
For example, consider the states at level 4:
    * The 10 states with j = &#x200b;9â„2 come from l = 4 and s parallel to l.
      Thus they have a positive spin-orbit interaction energy.
    * The 8 states with j = &#x200b;7â„2 came from l = 4 and s anti-parallel to
      l. Thus they have a negative spin-orbit interaction energy.
    * The 6 states with j = &#x200b;5â„2 came from l = 2 and s parallel to l.
      Thus they have a positive spin-orbit interaction energy. However its
      magnitude is half compared to the states with j = &#x200b;9â„2.
    * The 4 states with j = &#x200b;3â„2 came from l = 2 and s anti-parallel to
      l. Thus they have a negative spin-orbit interaction energy. However its
      magnitude is half compared to the states with j = &#x200b;7â„2.
    * The 2 states with j = &#x200b;1â„2 came from l = 0 and thus have zero
      spin-orbit interaction energy.
**** Changing the profile of the potential[edit] ****
The harmonic_oscillator potential     V ( r ) = &#x03BC;  &#x03C9;  2    r  2
/  2   {\displaystyle V(r)=\mu \omega ^{2}r^{2}/2}  [V(r)=\mu \omega ^{2}r^{2}/
2] grows infinitely as the distance from the center r goes to infinity. A more
realistic potential, such as WoodsÃ¢Â€Â“Saxon_potential, would approach a constant
at this limit. One main consequence is that the average radius of nucleons'
orbits would be larger in a realistic potential; This leads to a reduced term
&#x210F;  2   l ( l + 1 )  /  2 m  r  2      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \hbar
^{2}l(l+1)/2mr^{2}}  [\scriptstyle \hbar ^{2}l(l+1)/2mr^{2}] in the Laplace
operator of the Hamiltonian. Another main difference is that orbits with high
average radii, such as those with high n or high l, will have a lower energy
than in a harmonic oscillator potential. Both effects lead to a reduction in
the energy levels of high l orbits..
**** Predicted magic numbers[edit] ****
Low-lying energy levels in a single-particle shell model with an oscillator
potential (with a small negative l2 term) without spin-orbit (left) and with
spin-orbit (right) interaction. The number to the right of a level indicates
its degeneracy, (2j+1). The boxed integers indicate the magic numbers.
Together with the spin-orbit interaction, and for appropriate magnitudes of
both effects, one is led to the following qualitative picture: At all levels,
the highest j states have their energies shifted downwards, especially for high
n (where the highest j is high). This is both due to the negative spin-orbit
interaction energy and to the reduction in energy resulting from deforming the
potential to a more realistic one. The second-to-highest j states, on the
contrary, have their energy shifted up by the first effect and down by the
second effect, leading to a small overall shift. The shifts in the energy of
the highest j states can thus bring the energy of states of one level to be
closer to the energy of states of a lower level. The "shells" of the shell
model are then no longer identical to the levels denoted by n, and the magic
numbers are changed.
We may then suppose that the highest j states for n = 3 have an intermediate
energy between the average energies of n = 2 and n = 3, and suppose that the
highest j states for larger n (at least up to n = 7) have an energy closer to
the average energy of nÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1. Then we get the following shells (see the figure)
    * 1st shell: â€‡2 states (n = 0, j = &#x200b;1â„2).
    * 2nd shell: â€‡6 states (n = 1, j = &#x200b;1â„2 or &#x200b;3â„2).
    * 3rd shell: 12 states (n = 2, j = &#x200b;1â„2, &#x200b;3â„2 or
      &#x200b;5â„2).
    * 4th shell: â€‡8 states (n = 3, j = &#x200b;7â„2).
    * 5th shell: 22 states (n = 3, j = &#x200b;1â„2, &#x200b;3â„2 or &#x200b;5â„2;
      n = 4, j = &#x200b;9â„2).
    * 6th shell: 32 states (n = 4, j = &#x200b;1â„2, &#x200b;3â„2, &#x200b;5â„2 or
      &#x200b;7â„2; n = 5, j = &#x200b;11â„2).
    * 7th shell: 44 states (n = 5, j = &#x200b;1â„2, &#x200b;3â„2, &#x200b;5â„2,
      &#x200b;7â„2 or &#x200b;9â„2; n = 6, j = &#x200b;13â„2).
    * 8th shell: 58 states (n = 6, j = &#x200b;1â„2, &#x200b;3â„2, &#x200b;5â„2,
      &#x200b;7â„2, &#x200b;9â„2 or &#x200b;11â„2; n = 7, j = &#x200b;15â„2).
and so on.
Note that the numbers of states after the 4th shell are doubled triangular
numbers PLUS TWO. Spin-orbit coupling causes so-called 'intruder levels' to
drop down from the next higher shell into the structure of the previous shell.
The sizes of the intruders are such that the resulting shell sizes are
themselves increased to the very next higher doubled triangular numbers from
those of the harmonic oscillator. For example, 1f2p has 20 nucleons, and spin-
orbit coupling adds 1g9/2 (10 nucleons) leading to a new shell with 30
nucleons. 1g2d3s has 30 nucleons, and addition of intruder 1h11/2 (12 nucleons)
yields a new shell size of 42, and so on.
The magic numbers are then
    * â€‡â€‡2
    * â€‡â€‡8=2+6
    * â€‡20=2+6+12
    * â€‡28=2+6+12+8
    * â€‡50=2+6+12+8+22
    * â€‡82=2+6+12+8+22+32
    * 126=2+6+12+8+22+32+44
    * 184=2+6+12+8+22+32+44+58
and so on. This gives all the observed magic numbers, and also predicts a new
one (the so-called island_of_stability) at the value of 184 (for protons, the
magic number 126 has not been observed yet, and more complicated theoretical
considerations predict the magic number to be 114 instead).
Another way to predict magic (and semi-magic) numbers is by laying out the
idealized filling order (with spin-orbit splitting but energy levels not
overlapping). For consistency s is split into j = 1Ã¢ÂÂ„2 and j = -1Ã¢ÂÂ„2
components with 2 and 0 members respectively. Taking leftmost and rightmost
total counts within sequences marked bounded by / here gives the magic and
semi-magic numbers.
    * s(2,0)/p(4,2) > 2,2/6,8, so (semi)magic numbers 2,2/6,8
    * d(6,4):s(2,0)/f(8,6):p(4,2) > 14,18:20,20/28,34:38,40, so 14,20/28,40
    * g(10,8):d(6,4):s(2,0)/h(12,10):f(8,6):p(4,2) > 50,58,64,68,70,70/
      82,92,100,106,110,112, so 50,70/82,112
    * i(14,12):g(10,8):d(6,4):s(2,0)/j(16,14):h(12,10):f(8,6):p(4,2) >
      126,138,148,156,162,166,168,168/184,198,210,220,228,234,238,240, so
      126,168/184,240
The rightmost predicted magic numbers of each pair within the quartets bisected
by / are double tetrahedral numbers from the Pascal Triangle:
2,Â 8,Â 20,Â 40,Â 70,Â 112,Â 168,Â 240 are 2x 1,Â 4,Â 10,Â 20,Â 35,Â 56,Â 84,Â 120,Â ..., and
the leftmost members of the pairs differ from the rightmost by double
triangular numbers: 2Â Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â 2Â =Â 0, 8Â Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â 6Â =Â 2, 20Â Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â 14Â =Â 6, 40Â Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â 28Â =Â 12,
70Â Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â 50Â =Â 20, 112Â Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â 82Â =Â 30, 168Â Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â 126Â =Â 42, 240Â Ã¢ÂˆÂ’Â 184Â =Â 56, where
0,Â 2,Â 6,Â 12,Â 20,Â 30,Â 42,Â 56,Â ... are 2Â ÃƒÂ— 0,Â 1,Â 3,Â 6,Â 10,Â 15,Â 21,Â 28,Â ...Â .
**** Other properties of nuclei[edit] ****
This model also predicts or explains with some success other properties of
nuclei, in particular spin and parity of nuclei ground_states, and to some
extent their excited_states as well. Take 17
8O (oxygen-17) as an example: Its nucleus has eight protons filling the three
first proton "shells", eight neutrons filling the three first neutron "shells",
and one extra neutron. All protons in a complete proton shell have total
angular_momentum zero, since their angular momenta cancel each other. The same
is true for neutrons. All protons in the same level (n) have the same parity
(either +1 or Ã¢ÂˆÂ’1), and since the parity of a pair of particles is the product
of their parities, an even number of protons from the same level (n) will have
+1 parity. Thus the total angular momentum of the eight protons and the first
eight neutrons is zero, and their total parity is +1. This means that the spin
(i.e. angular momentum) of the nucleus, as well as its parity, are fully
determined by that of the ninth neutron. This one is in the first (i.e. lowest
energy) state of the 4th shell, which is a d-shell (l = 2), and since     p =
( &#x2212; 1  )  l     {\displaystyle p=(-1)^{l}}  [p=(-1)^{l}], this gives the
nucleus an overall parity ofÂ +1. This 4th d-shell has a j = &#x200b;5â„2, thus
the nucleus of 17
8O is expected to have positive parity and total angular momentum &#x200b;5â„2,
which indeed it has.
The rules for the ordering of the nucleus shells are similar to Hund's_Rules of
the atomic shells, however, unlike its use in atomic physics the completion of
a shell is not signified by reaching the next n, as such the shell model cannot
accurately predict the order of excited nuclei states, though it is very
successful in predicting the ground states. The order of the first few terms
are listed as follows: 1s, 1p&#x200b;3â„2, 1p&#x200b;1â„2, 1d&#x200b;5â„2, 2s,
1d&#x200b;3â„2... For further clarification on the notation refer to the article
on the Russell-Saunders term_symbol.
For nuclei farther from the magic_numbers one must add the assumption that due
to the relation between the strong_nuclear_force and angular momentum, protons
or neutrons with the same n tend to form pairs of opposite angular momenta.
Therefore, a nucleus with an even number of protons and an even number of
neutrons has 0 spin and positive parity. A nucleus with an even number of
protons and an odd number of neutrons (or vice versa) has the parity of the
last neutron (or proton), and the spin equal to the total angular momentum of
this neutron (or proton). By "last" we mean the properties coming from the
highest energy level.
In the case of a nucleus with an odd number of protons and an odd number of
neutrons, one must consider the total angular momentum and parity of both the
last neutron and the last proton. The nucleus parity will be a product of
theirs, while the nucleus spin will be one of the possible results of the sum
of their angular momenta (with other possible results being excited states of
the nucleus).
The ordering of angular momentum levels within each shell is according to the
principles described above - due to spin-orbit interaction, with high angular
momentum states having their energies shifted downwards due to the deformation
of the potential (i.e. moving from a harmonic oscillator potential to a more
realistic one). For nucleon pairs, however, it is often energetically favorable
to be at high angular momentum, even if its energy level for a single nucleon
would be higher. This is due to the relation between angular momentum and the
strong_nuclear_force.
Nuclear_magnetic_moment is partly predicted by this simple version of the shell
model. The magnetic moment is calculated through j, l and s of the "last"
nucleon, but nuclei are not in states of well defined l and s. Furthermore, for
odd-odd_nuclei, one has to consider the two "last" nucleons, as in deuterium.
Therefore, one gets several possible answers for the nuclear magnetic moment,
one for each possible combined l and s state, and the real state of the nucleus
is a superposition of them. Thus the real (measured) nuclear magnetic moment is
somewhere in between the possible answers.
The electric_dipole of a nucleus is always zero, because its ground_state has a
definite parity, so its matter density (     &#x03C8;  2     {\displaystyle
\psi ^{2}}  [\psi ^{2}], where     &#x03C8;   {\displaystyle \psi }  [\psi ] is
the wavefunction) is always invariant under parity. This is usually the
situations with the atomic_electric_dipole as well.
Higher electric and magnetic multipole_moments cannot be predicted by this
simple version of the shell model, for the reasons similar to those in the case
of deuterium.
***** Including residual interactions[edit] *****
Residual interactions among valence nucleons are included by diagonalising an
effective Hamiltonian in a valence space outside an inert core. As indicated,
only single-particle states lying in the valence space are active in the basis
used.
For nuclei having two or more valence nucleons (i.e. nucleons outside a closed
shell) a residual two-body interaction must be added. This residual term comes
from the part of the inter-nucleon interaction not included in the
approximative average potential. Through this inclusion different shell
configurations are mixed and the energy degeneracy of states corresponding to
the same configuration is broken.[3][4]
These residual interactions are incorporated through shell model calculations
in a truncated model space (or valence space). This space is spanned by a basis
of many-particle states where only single-particle states in the model space
are active. The SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation is solved in this basis, using an
effective Hamiltonian specifically suited for the model space. This Hamiltonian
is different from the one of free nucleons as it among other things has to
compensate for excluded configurations.[4]
One can do away with the average potential approximation entirely by extending
the model space to the previously inert core and treat all single-particle
states up to the model space truncation as active. This forms the basis of the
no-core shell model, which is an ab_initio_method. It is necessary to include a
three-body_interaction in such calculations to achieve agreement with
experiments.[5]
***** Collective rotation and the deformed potential[edit] *****
In 1953, the first experimental examples were found of rotational bands in
nuclei, with their energy levels following the same J(J+1) pattern of energies
as in rotating molecules. Quantum mechanically, it is impossible to have a
collective rotation of a sphere, so this implied that the shape of these nuclei
was nonspherical. In principle, these rotational states could have been
described as coherent superpositions of particle-hole excitations in the basis
consisting of single-particle states of the spherical potential. But in
reality, the description of these states in this manner is intractable, due to
the large number of valence particles -- and this intractability was even
greater in the 1950's, when computing power was extremely rudimentary. For
these reasons, Aage_Bohr, Ben_Mottelson, and Sven_GÃƒÂ¶sta_Nilsson constructed
models in which the potential was deformed into an ellipsoidal shape. The first
successful model of this type is the one now known as the Nilsson_model. It is
essentially the harmonic oscillator model described in this article, but with
anisotropy added, so that the oscillator frequencies along the three Cartesian
axes are not all the same. Typically the shape is a prolate ellipsoid, with the
axis of symmetry taken to be z. Because the potential is not spherically
symmetric, the single-particle states are not states of good angular momentum
J. However, a Lagrange multiplier     &#x2212; &#x03C9; &#x22C5; J
{\displaystyle -\omega \cdot J}  [{\displaystyle -\omega \cdot J}], known as a
"cranking" term, can be added to the Hamiltonian. Usually the angular frequency
vector ÃÂ‰ is taken to be perpendicular to the symmetry axis, although tilted-
axis cranking can also be considered. Filling the single-particle states up to
the Fermi level then produces states whose expected angular momentum along the
cranking axis     &#x27E8;  J  x   &#x27E9;   {\displaystyle \langle J_
{x}\rangle }  [{\displaystyle \langle J_{x}\rangle }] is the desired value.
***** Related models[edit] *****
Igal_Talmi developed a method to obtain the information from experimental data
and use it to calculate and predict energies which have not been measured. This
method has been successfully used by many nuclear physicists and has led to
deeper understanding of nuclear structure. The theory which gives a good
description of these properties was developed. This description turned out to
furnish the shell model basis of the elegant and successful interacting_boson
model.
A model derived from the nuclear shell model is the alpha particle model
developed by Henry_Margenau, Edward_Teller, J. K. Pering, T._H._Skyrme, also
sometimes called the Skyrme_model.[6][7] Note, however, that the Skyrme model
is usually taken to be a model of the nucleon itself, as a "cloud" of mesons
(pions), rather than as a model of the nucleus as a "cloud" of alpha particles.
