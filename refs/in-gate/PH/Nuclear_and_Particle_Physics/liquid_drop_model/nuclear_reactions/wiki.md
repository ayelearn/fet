Process in which two nuclei collide to produce one or more nuclides
In this symbolic representing of a nuclear reaction, lithium-6 (6
3Li
) and deuterium (2
1H
) react to form the highly excited intermediate nucleus 8
4Be
 which then decays immediately into two alpha_particles of helium-4 (4
2He
). Protons are symbolically represented by red spheres, and neutrons by blue
spheres.

In nuclear_physics and nuclear_chemistry, a nuclear reaction is semantically
considered to be the process in which two nuclei, or else a nucleus of an atom
and a subatomic_particle (such as a proton, neutron, or high energy electron)
from outside the atom, collide to produce one or more nuclides that are
different from the nuclide(s) that began the process (parent nuclei). Thus, a
nuclear reaction must cause a transformation of at least one nuclide to
another. If a nucleus interacts with another nucleus or particle and they then
separate without changing the nature of any nuclide, the process is simply
referred to as a type of nuclear scattering, rather than a nuclear reaction.
In principle, a reaction can involve more than two particles colliding, but
because the probability of three or more nuclei to meet at the same time at the
same place is much less than for two nuclei, such an event is exceptionally
rare (see triple_alpha_process for an example very close to a three-body
nuclear reaction). "Nuclear reaction" is a term implying an induced changing in
a nuclide, and thus it does not apply to any type of radioactive_decay (which
by definition is a spontaneous process).[citation_needed]
Natural nuclear reactions occur in the interaction between cosmic_rays and
matter, and nuclear reactions can be employed artificially to obtain nuclear
energy, at an adjustable rate, on demand. Perhaps the most notable nuclear
reactions are the nuclear_chain_reactions in fissionable materials that produce
induced nuclear_fission, and the various nuclear_fusion reactions of light
elements that power the energy production of the Sun and stars.

***** History[edit] *****
In 1919, Ernest_Rutherford was able to accomplish transmutation of nitrogen
into oxygen at the University of Manchester, using alpha particles directed at
nitrogen 14N + ÃÂ± Ã¢Â†Â’ 17O + p.Â  This was the first observation of an induced
nuclear reaction, that is, a reaction in which particles from one decay are
used to transform another atomic nucleus. Eventually, in 1932 at Cambridge
University, a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was
achieved by Rutherford's colleagues John_Cockcroft and Ernest_Walton, who used
artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7, to split the nucleus into
two alpha particles. The feat was popularly known as "splitting the atom",
although it was not the modern nuclear_fission reaction later discovered in
heavy elements, in 1938 by the German scientists Otto_Hahn and Fritz
Strassmann.[1]
***** Nomenclature[edit] *****
Nuclear reactions may be shown in a form similar to chemical equations, for
which invariant_mass must balance for each side of the equation, and in which
transformations of particles must follow certain conservation laws, such as
conservation of charge and baryon number (total atomic mass_number). An example
of this notation follows:
      6      2       4
      3Li +Â 1H Ã¢Â†Â2He +Â ?.
      Â      Â       Â 
To balance the equation above for mass, charge and mass number, the second
nucleus to the right must have atomic number 2 and mass number 4; it is
therefore also helium-4. The complete equation therefore reads:
      6      2       4      4
      3Li +Â 1H Ã¢Â†Â2He +Â 2He
      Â      Â       Â      .
or more simply:
      6      2       2Â 
      3Li +Â 1H Ã¢Â†Â4
      Â      Â       2He
                     .
Instead of using the full equations in the style above, in many situations a
compact notation is used to describe nuclear reactions. This style of the form
A(b,c)D is equivalent to A + b producing c + D. Common light particles are
often abbreviated in this shorthand, typically p for proton, n for neutron, d
for deuteron, ÃÂ± representing an alpha_particle or helium-4, ÃÂ² for beta
particle or electron, ÃÂ³ for gamma_photon, etc. The reaction above would be
written as Li-6(d,ÃÂ±)ÃÂ±.[2][3]
***** Energy conservation[edit] *****
Kinetic_energy may be released during the course of a reaction (exothermic
reaction) or kinetic energy may have to be supplied for the reaction to take
place (endothermic_reaction). This can be calculated by reference to a table of
very accurate particle rest masses,[4] as follows: according to the reference
tables, the 6
3Li
 nucleus has a standard_atomic_weight of 6.015 atomic_mass_units (abbreviated
u), the deuterium has 2.014 u, and the helium-4 nucleus has 4.0026 u. Thus:
    * the sum of the rest mass of the individual nuclei = 6.015 + 2.014 = 8.029
      u;
    * the total rest mass on the two helium-nuclei = 2 ÃƒÂ— 4.0026 = 8.0052 u;
    * missing rest mass = 8.029 Ã¢Â€Â“ 8.0052 = 0.0238 atomic mass units.
In a nuclear reaction, the total (relativistic)_energy_is_conserved. The
"missing" rest mass must therefore reappear as kinetic energy released in the
reaction; its source is the nuclear binding_energy. Using Einstein's mass-
energy_equivalence formula EÂ =Â mcÃ‚Â², the amount of energy released can be
determined. We first need the energy equivalent of one atomic_mass_unit:
      1Â uÂ cÃ‚Â²Â =Â (1.66054Â ÃƒÂ—Â 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’27Â kg)Â ÃƒÂ—Â (2.99792Â ÃƒÂ—Â 108Â m/s)Ã‚Â²Â 
      =Â 1.49242Â ÃƒÂ—Â 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’10Â kgÂ (m/s)Ã‚Â²Â =Â 1.49242Â ÃƒÂ—Â 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’10Â J (joule)Â ÃƒÂ—Â 
      (1Â MeVÂ /Â 1.60218Â ÃƒÂ—Â 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’13Â J)
      =Â 931.49Â MeV,
      so 1Â uÂ cÃ‚Â²Â =Â 931.49Â MeV.
Hence, the energy released is 0.0238 ÃƒÂ— 931 MeV = 22.2 MeV.
Expressed differently: the mass is reduced by 0.3%, corresponding to 0.3% of
90Â PJ/kg is 270Â TJ/kg.
This is a large amount of energy for a nuclear reaction; the amount is so high
because the binding energy per nucleon of the helium-4 nucleus is unusually
high, because the He-4 nucleus is "doubly_magic". (The He-4 nucleus is
unusually stable and tightly bound for the same reason that the helium atom is
inert: each pair of protons and neutrons in He-4 occupies a filled 1s nuclear
orbital in the same way that the pair of electrons in the helium atom occupy a
filled 1s electron_orbital). Consequently, alpha particles appear frequently on
the right hand side of nuclear reactions.
The energy released in a nuclear reaction can appear mainly in one of three
ways:
    * kinetic energy of the product particles (fraction of the kinetic energy
      of the charged nuclear reaction products can be directly converted into
      electrostatic energy);[5]
    * emission of very high energy photons, called gamma_rays;
    * some energy may remain in the nucleus, as a metastable energy_level.
When the product nucleus is metastable, this is indicated by placing an
asterisk ("*") next to its atomic number. This energy is eventually released
through nuclear_decay.
A small amount of energy may also emerge in the form of X-rays. Generally, the
product nucleus has a different atomic number, and thus the configuration of
its electron_shells is wrong. As the electrons rearrange themselves and drop to
lower energy levels, internal transition X-rays (X-rays with precisely defined
emission_lines) may be emitted.
***** Q-value and energy balance[edit] *****
In writing down the reaction equation, in a way analogous to a chemical
equation, one may in addition give the reaction energy on the right side:
      Target nucleus + projectile Ã¢Â†Â’ Final nucleus + ejectile + Q.
For the particular case discussed above, the reaction energy has already been
calculated as Q = 22.2Â MeV. Hence:
      6      2       2Â 
      3Li +Â 1H Ã¢Â†Â4   +Â 22.2Â MeV.
      Â      Â       2He
                     Â 
The reaction energy (the "Q-value") is positive for exothermal reactions and
negative for endothermal reactions, opposite to the similar expression in
chemistry. On the one hand, it is the difference between the sums of kinetic
energies on the final side and on the initial side. But on the other hand, it
is also the difference between the nuclear rest masses on the initial side and
on the final side (in this way, we have calculated the Q-value above).
***** Reaction rates[edit] *****
If the reaction equation is balanced, that does not mean that the reaction
really occurs. The rate at which reactions occur depends on the particle
energy, the particle flux and the reaction cross_section. An example of a large
repository of reaction rates is the REACLIB database, as maintained by the
Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Astrophysics.
***** Neutrons vs. ions[edit] *****
In the initial collision which begins the reaction, the particles must approach
closely enough so that the short range strong_force can affect them. As most
common nuclear particles are positively charged, this means they must overcome
considerable electrostatic_repulsion before the reaction can begin. Even if the
target nucleus is part of a neutral atom, the other particle must penetrate
well beyond the electron_cloud and closely approach the nucleus, which is
positively charged. Thus, such particles must be first accelerated to high
energy, for example by:
    * particle_accelerators;
    * nuclear_decay (alpha particles are the main type of interest here, since
      beta and gamma rays are rarely involved in nuclear reactions);
    * very high temperatures, on the order of millions of degrees, producing
      thermonuclear reactions;
    * cosmic_rays.
Also, since the force of repulsion is proportional to the product of the two
charges, reactions between heavy nuclei are rarer, and require higher
initiating energy, than those between a heavy and light nucleus; while
reactions between two light nuclei are the most common ones.
Neutrons, on the other hand, have no electric charge to cause repulsion, and
are able to initiate a nuclear reaction at very low energies. In fact, at
extremely low particle energies (corresponding, say, to thermal_equilibrium_at
room_temperature), the neutron's de_Broglie_wavelength is greatly increased,
possibly greatly increasing its capture cross section, at energies close to
resonances of the nuclei involved. Thus low-energy neutrons may be even more
reactive than high energy neutrons.
***** Notable types[edit] *****
While the number of possible nuclear reactions is immense, there are several
types which are more common, or otherwise notable. Some examples include:
    * Fusion reactions Ã¢Â€Â” two light nuclei join to form a heavier one, with
      additional particles (usually protons or neutrons) emitted subsequently.
    * Spallation Ã¢Â€Â” a nucleus is hit by a particle with sufficient energy and
      momentum to knock out several small fragments or smash it into many
      fragments.
    * Induced_gamma_emission belongs to a class in which only photons were
      involved in creating and destroying states of nuclear excitation.
    * Alpha_decay Ã¢Â€Â” Though driven by the same underlying forces as
      spontaneous fission, ÃÂ± decay is usually considered to be separate from
      the latter. The often-quoted idea that "nuclear reactions" are confined
      to induced processes is incorrect. "Radioactive decays" are a subgroup of
      "nuclear reactions" that are spontaneous rather than induced. For
      example, so-called "hot alpha particles" with unusually high energies may
      actually be produced in induced ternary_fission, which is an induced
      nuclear reaction (contrasting with spontaneous fission). Such alphas
      occur from spontaneous ternary fission as well.
    * Fission reactions Ã¢Â€Â” a very heavy nucleus, after absorbing additional
      light particles (usually neutrons), splits into two or sometimes three
      pieces. This is an induced nuclear reaction. Spontaneous_fission, which
      occurs without assistance of a neutron, is usually not considered a
      nuclear reaction. At most, it is not an induced nuclear reaction.
**** Direct reactions[edit] ****
An intermediate energy projectile transfers energy or picks up or loses
nucleons to the nucleus in a single quick (10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’21 second) event. Energy and
momentum transfer are relatively small. These are particularly useful in
experimental nuclear physics, because the reaction mechanisms are often simple
enough to calculate with sufficient accuracy to probe the structure of the
target nucleus.
*** Inelastic scattering[edit] ***
Main article: Inelastic_scattering
Only energy and momentum are transferred.
    * (p,p') tests differences between nuclear states.
    * (ÃÂ±,ÃÂ±') measures nuclear surface shapes and sizes. Since ÃÂ± particles
      that hit the nucleus react more violently, elastic and shallow inelastic
      ÃÂ± scattering are sensitive to the shapes and sizes of the targets, like
      light_scattered from a small black object.
    * (e,e') is useful for probing the interior structure. Since electrons
      interact less strongly than do protons and neutrons, they reach to the
      centers of the targets and their wave_functions are less distorted by
      passing through the nucleus.
*** Transfer reactions[edit] ***
Usually at moderately low energy, one or more nucleons are transferred between
the projectile and target. These are useful in studying outer shell structure
of nuclei.
    * (ÃÂ±,n) and (ÃÂ±,p) reactions. Some of the earliest nuclear reactions
      studied involved an alpha particle produced by alpha_decay, knocking a
      nucleon from a target nucleus.
    * (d,n) and (d,p) reactions. A deuteron beam impinges on a target; the
      target nuclei absorb either the neutron or proton from the deuteron. The
      deuteron is so loosely bound that this is almost the same as proton or
      neutron capture. A compound nucleus may be formed, leading to additional
      neutrons being emitted more slowly. (d,n) reactions are used to generate
      energetic neutrons.
    * The strangeness exchange reaction (K, ÃÂ€) has been used to study
      hypernuclei.
    * The reaction 14N(ÃÂ±,p)17O performed by Rutherford in 1917 (reported
      1919), is generally regarded as the first nuclear_transmutation
      experiment.

Reactions with neutrons are important in nuclear_reactors and nuclear_weapons.
While the best-known neutron reactions are neutron_scattering, neutron_capture,
and nuclear_fission, for some light nuclei (especially odd-odd_nuclei) the most
probable reaction with a thermal_neutron is a transfer reaction:
Some reactions are only possible with fast_neutrons:
    * (n,2n) reactions produce small amounts of protactinium-231 and uranium-
      232 in the thorium_cycle which is otherwise relatively free of highly
      radioactive actinide products.
    * 9Be + n Ã¢Â†Â’ 2ÃÂ± + 2n can contribute some additional neutrons in the
      beryllium neutron_reflector of a nuclear_weapon.
    * 7Li + n Ã¢Â†Â’ T + ÃÂ± + n unexpectedly contributed additional yield in
      Castle_Bravo, Castle_Romeo, and Castle_Yankee, the three highest-yield
      nuclear_tests conducted by the U.S.
**** Compound nuclear reactions[edit] ****
Either a low-energy projectile is absorbed or a higher energy particle
transfers energy to the nucleus, leaving it with too much energy to be fully
bound together. On a time scale of about 10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’19 seconds, particles, usually
neutrons, are "boiled" off. That is, it remains together until enough energy
happens to be concentrated in one neutron to escape the mutual attraction.
Charged particles rarely boil off because of the coulomb_barrier. The excited
quasi-bound nucleus is called a compound nucleus.
    * Low energy (e, e' xn), (ÃÂ³, xn) (the xn indicating one or more neutrons),
      where the gamma or virtual gamma energy is near the giant_dipole
      resonance. These increase the need for radiation_shielding around
      electron_accelerators.
