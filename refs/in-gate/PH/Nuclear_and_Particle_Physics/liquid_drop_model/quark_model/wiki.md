Figure 1: The pseudoscalar meson nonet. Members of the original meson "octet"
are shown in green, the singlet in magenta. Although these mesons are now
grouped into a nonet, the Eightfold_Way name derives from the patterns of eight
for the mesons and baryons in the original classification scheme.
In particle_physics, the quark model is a classification scheme for hadrons in
terms of their valence quarksâthe quarks and antiquarks which give rise to
the quantum_numbers of the hadrons. The quark model underlies "flavor_SU(3)",
or the Eightfold_Way, the successful classification scheme organizing the large
number of lighter hadrons that were being discovered starting in the 1950s and
continuing through the 1960s. It received experimental verification beginning
in the late 1960s and is a valid effective classification of them to date. The
model was independently proposed by physicists Murray_Gell-Mann,[1] who dubbed
them "quarks" in a concise paper, and George_Zweig,[2][3] who suggested "aces"
in a longer manuscript. AndrÃ©_Petermann also touched upon the central ideas
from 1963 to 1965, without as much quantitative substantiation.[4][5] Today,
the model has essentially been absorbed as a component of the established
quantum_field_theory of strong and electroweak particle interactions, dubbed
the Standard_Model.
Hadrons are not really "elementary", and can be regarded as bound states of
their "valence quarks" and antiquarks, which give rise to the quantum_numbers
of the hadrons. These quantum numbers are labels identifying the hadrons, and
are of two kinds. One set comes from the PoincarÃ©_symmetryâJPC, where J, P
and C stand for the total_angular_momentum, P-symmetry, and C-symmetry,
respectively.
The remaining are flavor_quantum_numbers such as the isospin, strangeness,
charm, and so on. The strong interactions binding the quarks together are
insensitive to these quantum numbers, so variation of them leads to systematic
mass and coupling relationships among the hadrons in the same flavor multiplet.
All quarks are assigned a baryon_number of â. Up, charm and top_quarks have
an electric_charge of +â, while the down, strange, and bottom_quarks have an
electric charge of ââ. Antiquarks have the opposite quantum numbers. Quarks
are spin-Â½ particles, and thus fermions. Each quark or antiquark obeys the
Gell-MannâNishijima formula individually, so any additive assembly of them
will as well.
Mesons are made of a valence quarkâantiquark pair (thus have a baryon number
of 0), while baryons are made of three quarks (thus have a baryon number of 1).
This article discusses the quark model for the up, down, and strange flavors of
quark (which form an approximate flavor SU(3)_symmetry). There are
generalizations to larger number of flavors.

***** History[edit] *****
Developing classification schemes for hadrons became a timely question after
new experimental techniques uncovered so many of them, that it became clear
that they could not all be elementary. These discoveries led Wolfgang_Pauli to
exclaim "Had I foreseen that, I would have gone into botany." and Enrico_Fermi
to advise his student Leon_Lederman: "Young man, if I could remember the names
of these particles, I would have been a botanist." These new schemes earned
Nobel prizes for experimental particle physicists, including Luis_Alvarez, who
was at the forefront of many of these developments. Constructing hadrons as
bound states of fewer constituents would thus organize the "zoo" at hand.
Several early proposals, such as the ones by Enrico_Fermi and Chen-Ning_Yang
(1949), and the Sakata_model (1956), ended up satisfactorily covering the
mesons, but failed with baryons, and so were unable to explain all the data.
The Gell-MannâNishijima_formula, developed by Murray_Gell-Mann and Kazuhiko
Nishijima, led to the Eightfold_Way classification, invented by Gell-Mann, with
important independent contributions from Yuval_Ne'eman, in 1961. The hadrons
were organized into SU(3) representation multiplets, octets and decuplets, of
roughly the same mass, due to the strong interactions; and smaller mass
differences linked to the flavor quantum numbers, invisible to the strong
interactions. The Gell-MannâOkubo_mass_formula systematized the
quantification of these small mass differences among members of a hadronic
multiplet, controlled by the explicit_symmetry_breaking of SU(3).
The spin-&#x200b;3⁄2

Ω−
 baryon
, a member of the ground-state decuplet, was a crucial prediction of that
classification. After it was discovered in an experiment at Brookhaven_National
Laboratory, Gell-Mann received a Nobel_prize_in_physics for his work on the
Eightfold Way, in 1969.
Finally, in 1964, Gell-Mann, and, independently, George_Zweig, discerned what
the Eightfold Way picture encodes. They posited elementary fermionic
constituents, unobserved, and possibly unobservable in a free form, underlying
and elegantly encoding the Eightfold Way classification, in an economical,
tight structure, resulting in further simplicity. Hadronic mass differences
were now linked to the different masses of the constituent quarks.
It would take about a decade for the unexpected natureâand physical
realityâof these quarks to be appreciated more fully (See Quarks). Counter-
intuitively, they cannot ever be observed in isolation (color_confinement), but
instead always combine with other quarks to form full hadrons, which then
furnish ample indirect information on the trapped quarks themselves.
Conversely, the quarks serve in the definition of quantum_chromodynamics, the
fundamental theory fully describing the strong interactions; and the Eightfold
Way is now understood to be a consequence of the flavor symmetry structure of
the lightest three of them.
***** Mesons[edit] *****
See also: Meson and List_of_mesons
Figure 2: Pseudoscalar mesons of spin 0 form a nonet
Figure 3: Mesons of spin 1 form a nonet
The Eightfold Way classification is named after the following fact. If we take
three flavors of quarks, then the quarks lie in the fundamental_representation,
3 (called the triplet) of flavor SU(3). The antiquarks lie in the complex
conjugate representation 3. The nine states (nonet) made out of a pair can be
decomposed into the trivial_representation, 1 (called the singlet), and the
adjoint_representation, 8 (called the octet). The notation for this
decomposition is
          3  &#x2297;   3 &#x00AF;   =  8  &#x2295;  1    {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {3} \otimes \mathbf {\overline {3}} =\mathbf {8} \oplus \mathbf
      {1} }  [\mathbf{3}\otimes \mathbf{\overline{3}} = \mathbf{8} \oplus
      \mathbf{1}].
Figure 1 shows the application of this decomposition to the mesons. If the
flavor symmetry were exact (as in the limit that only the strong interactions
operate, but the electroweak interactions are notionally switched off), then
all nine mesons would have the same mass. However, the physical content of the
full theory[clarification_needed] includes consideration of the symmetry
breaking induced by the quark mass differences, and considerations of mixing
between various multiplets (such as the octet and the singlet).
N.B. Nevertheless, the mass splitting between the
η
 and the
η′
 is larger than the quark model can accommodate, and this "

η
â
η′
 puzzle
" has its origin in topological peculiarities of the strong interaction vacuum,
such as instanton configurations.
Mesons are hadrons with zero baryon_number. If the quarkâantiquark pair are
in an orbital_angular_momentum L state, and have spin S, then
    * |L â S| â¤ J â¤ L + S, where S = 0 or 1,
    * P = (â1)L + 1, where the 1 in the exponent arises from the intrinsic
      parity of the quarkâantiquark pair.
    * C = (â1)L + S for mesons which have no flavor. Flavored mesons have
      indefinite value of C.
    * For isospin I = 1 and 0 states, one can define a new multiplicative
      quantum_number called the G-parity such that G = (â1)I + L + S.
If P = (â1)J, then it follows that S = 1, thus PC= 1. States with these
quantum numbers are called natural parity states; while all other quantum
numbers are thus called exotic (for example the state JPC = 0ââ).

Since quarks are fermions, the spin-statistics_theorem implies that the
wavefunction of a baryon must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two
quarks. This antisymmetric wavefunction is obtained by making it fully
antisymmetric in color, discussed below, and symmetric in flavor, spin and
space put together. With three flavors, the decomposition in flavor is
          3  &#x2297;  3  &#x2297;  3  =   10   S   &#x2295;   8   M   &#x2295;
      8   M   &#x2295;   1   A     {\displaystyle \mathbf {3} \otimes \mathbf
      {3} \otimes \mathbf {3} =\mathbf {10} _{S}\oplus \mathbf {8} _{M}\oplus
      \mathbf {8} _{M}\oplus \mathbf {1} _{A}}  [\mathbf{3}\otimes\mathbf
      {3}\otimes\mathbf{3}=\mathbf{10}_S\oplus\mathbf{8}_M\oplus\mathbf
      {8}_M\oplus\mathbf{1}_A].
The decuplet is symmetric in flavor, the singlet antisymmetric and the two
octets have mixed symmetry. The space and spin parts of the states are thereby
fixed once the orbital angular momentum is given.
It is sometimes useful to think of the basis_states of quarks as the six states
of three flavors and two spins per flavor. This approximate symmetry is called
spin-flavor SU(6). In terms of this, the decomposition is
                6  &#x2297;  6  &#x2297;  6  =   56   S   &#x2295;   70   M
            &#x2295;   70   M   &#x2295;   20   A   &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle
            \mathbf {6} \otimes \mathbf {6} \otimes \mathbf {6} =\mathbf {56} _
            {S}\oplus \mathbf {70} _{M}\oplus \mathbf {70} _{M}\oplus \mathbf
            {20} _{A}~.}  [\mathbf{6}\otimes\mathbf{6}\otimes\mathbf{6}=\mathbf
            {56}_S\oplus\mathbf{70}_M\oplus\mathbf{70}_M\oplus\mathbf{20}_A
            ~.]
The 56 states with symmetric combination of spin and flavour decompose under
flavor SU(3) into
                56  =   10    3 2    &#x2295;   8    1 2    &#xA0; ,
            {\displaystyle \mathbf {56} =\mathbf {10} ^{\frac {3}{2}}\oplus
            \mathbf {8} ^{\frac {1}{2}}~,}  [\mathbf{56}=\mathbf{10}^\frac{3}
            {2}\oplus\mathbf{8}^\frac{1}{2}   ~,]
where the superscript denotes the spin, S, of the baryon. Since these states
are symmetric in spin and flavor, they should also be symmetric in spaceâa
condition that is easily satisfied by making the orbital angular momentum
L = 0. These are the ground state baryons.
The S = &#x200b;1⁄2 octet baryons are the two nucleons (
p+
,
n0
), the three Sigmas (
Σ+
,
Σ0
,
Σ−
), the two Xis (
Ξ0
,
Ξ−
), and the Lambda (
Λ0
). The S = &#x200b;3⁄2 decuplet baryons are the four Deltas (
Δ++
,
Δ+
,
Δ0
,
Δ−
), three Sigmas (
Σ∗+
,
Σ∗0
,
Σ∗−
), two Xis (
Ξ∗0
,
Ξ∗−
), and the Omega (
Ω−
).
For example, the constituent quark model wavefunction for the proton is
          |   p  &#x2191;   &#x27E9; =   1  18    [ 2  |   u  &#x2191;    d

Mixing of baryons, mass splittings within and between multiplets, and magnetic
moments are some of the other quantities that the model predicts successfully.
**** The discovery of color[edit] ****
Main article: Color_charge
Color quantum numbers are the characteristic charges of the strong force, and
are completely uninvolved in electroweak interactions. They were discovered as
a consequence of the quark model classification, when it was appreciated that
the spin S = &#x200b;3⁄2 baryon, the
Δ++
, required three up quarks with parallel spins and vanishing orbital angular
momentum. Therefore, it could not have an antisymmetric wave function, (due to
the Pauli_exclusion_principle), unless there were a hidden quantum number.
Oscar_Greenberg noted this problem in 1964, suggesting that quarks should be
para-fermions.[6]
Instead, six months later, Moo-Young_Han and Yoichiro_Nambu suggested the
existence of three triplets of quarks to solve this problem, but flavor and
color intertwined in that model: They did not commute.[7]
The modern concept of color completely commuting with all other charges and
providing the strong force charge was articulated in 1973, by William_Bardeen,
Harald_Fritzsch, and Murray_Gell-Mann.[8][9]
***** States outside the quark model[edit] *****
While the quark model is derivable from the theory of quantum_chromodynamics,
the structure of hadrons is more complicated than this model allows. The full
quantum_mechanical wave_function of any hadron must include virtual quark pairs
as well as virtual gluons, and allows for a variety of mixings. There may be
hadrons which lie outside the quark model. Among these are the glueballs (which
contain only valence gluons), hybrids (which contain valence quarks as well as
gluons) and "exotic_hadrons" (such as tetraquarks or pentaquarks).
