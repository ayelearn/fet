Alpha decay or Î±-decay is a type of radioactive_decay in which an atomic
nucleus emits an alpha_particle (helium nucleus) and thereby transforms or
'decays' into a different atomic nucleus, with a mass_number that is reduced by
four and an atomic_number that is reduced by two. An alpha particle is
identical to the nucleus of a helium-4 atom, which consists of two protons and
two neutrons. It has a charge of +2 e and a mass of 4 u. For example, uranium-
238 decays to form thorium-234. Alpha particles have a charge +2 e, but as a
nuclear equation describes a nuclear reaction without considering the electrons
â a convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in
neutral atoms â the charge is not usually shown.
Alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides. Theoretically, it can
occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than nickel (element 28), where the
overall binding_energy per nucleon is no longer a minimum and the nuclides are
therefore unstable toward spontaneous fission-type processes. In practice, this
mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than
nickel, with the lightest known alpha emitters being the lightest isotopes
(mass numbers 104â109) of tellurium (element 52). Exceptionally, however,
beryllium-8 decays to two alpha particles.
Alpha decay is by far the most common form of cluster_decay, where the parent
atom ejects a defined daughter collection of nucleons, leaving another defined
product behind. It is the most common form because of the combined extremely
high nuclear_binding_energy and relatively small mass of the alpha particle.
Like other cluster decays, alpha decay is fundamentally a quantum_tunneling
process. Unlike beta_decay, it is governed by the interplay between both the
nuclear_force and the electromagnetic_force.
Alpha_particles have a typical kinetic energy of 5 MeV (or â 0.13% of their
total energy, 110 TJ/kg) and have a speed of about 15,000,000 m/s, or 5% of the
speed_of_light. There is surprisingly small variation around this energy, due
to the heavy dependence of the half-life of this process on the energy produced
(see equations in the GeigerâNuttall_law). Because of their relatively large
mass, electric charge of +2 e and relatively low velocity, alpha particles are
very likely to interact with other atoms and lose their energy, and their
forward motion can be stopped by a few centimeters of air. Approximately 99% of
the helium produced on Earth is the result of the alpha decay of underground
deposits of minerals containing uranium or thorium. The helium is brought to
the surface as a by-product of natural_gas production.

***** History[edit] *****
See also: Alpha_particle_Â§ History_of_discovery_and_use
Alpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by
Ernest_Rutherford in 1899, and by 1907 they were identified as He2+ ions.
By 1928, George_Gamow had solved the theory of alpha decay via tunneling. The
alpha particle is trapped in a potential_well by the nucleus. Classically, it
is forbidden to escape, but according to the (then) newly discovered principles
of quantum_mechanics, it has a tiny (but non-zero) probability of "tunneling"
through the barrier and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus.
Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived, from first
principles, a relationship between the half-life of the decay, and the energy
of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically, and was
known as the GeigerâNuttall_law.[1]
***** Mechanism[edit] *****
The nuclear_force holding an atomic nucleus together is very strong, in general
much stronger than the repulsive electromagnetic_forces between the protons.
However, the nuclear force is also short range, dropping quickly in strength
beyond about 1 femtometre, while the electromagnetic force has unlimited range.
The strength of the attractive nuclear force keeping a nucleus together is thus
proportional to the number of nucleons, but the total disruptive
electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional
to the square of its atomic number. A nucleus with 210 or more nucleons is so
large that the strong nuclear force holding it together can just barely
counterbalance the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons it contains.
Alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as a means of increasing stability by
reducing size.[2]
One curiosity is why alpha particles, helium nuclei, should be preferentially
emitted as opposed to other particles like a single proton or neutron or other
atomic_nuclei.[note_1] Part of the answer comes from conservation_of_wave
function_symmetry, which prevents a particle from spontaneously changing from
exhibiting BoseâEinstein_statistics (if it had an even number of nucleons) to
FermiâDirac_statistics (if it had an odd number of nucleons) or vice versa.
Single proton emission, or the emission of any particle with an odd number of
nucleons would violate this conservation law. The rest of the answer comes from
the very high binding_energy of the alpha particle. Computing the total
disintegration energy given by the equation:
         E = (  m  i   &#x2212;  m  f   &#x2212;  m  p   )  c  2
      {\displaystyle E=(m_{\text{i}}-m_{\text{f}}-m_{\text{p}})c^{2}}  [
      {\displaystyle E=(m_{\text{i}}-m_{\text{f}}-m_{\text{p}})c^{2}}]
Where      m  i     {\displaystyle m_{\text{i}}}  [{\displaystyle m_{\text
{i}}}] is the initial mass of the nucleus,      m  f     {\displaystyle m_
{\text{f}}}  [{\displaystyle m_{\text{f}}}] is the mass of the nucleus after
particle emission, and      m  p     {\displaystyle m_{\text{p}}}  [m_\text{p}]
is the mass of the emitted particle, shows that alpha particle emission will
usually be possible just with energy from the nucleus itself, while other decay
modes will require additional energy. For example, performing the calculation
for uranium-232 shows that alpha particle emission would need only 5.4 MeV,
while a single proton emission would require 6.1 MeV. Most of this
disintegration energy becomes the kinetic_energy of the alpha particle itself,
although to maintain conservation_of_momentum part of this energy becomes the
recoil of the nucleus itself. However, since the mass numbers of most alpha
emitting radioisotopes exceed 210, far greater than the mass number of the
alpha particle (4) the part of the energy going to the recoil of the nucleus is
generally quite small.[2]
These disintegration energies however are substantially smaller than the
potential_barrier provided by the nuclear force, which prevents the alpha
particle from escaping. The energy needed is generally in the range of about
25 MeV, the amount of work that must be done against electromagnetic repulsion
to bring an alpha particle from infinity to a point near the nucleus just
outside the range of the nuclear force's influence. An alpha particle can be
thought of as being inside a potential barrier whose walls are 25 MeV. However,
decay alpha particles only have kinetic energies of 4 MeV to about 9 MeV, far
less than the energy needed to escape.
Quantum mechanics, however, provides a ready explanation, via the mechanism of
quantum tunnelling. The quantum tunnelling theory of alpha decay, independently
developed by George Gamow[3] and Ronald_Wilfred_Gurney and Edward_Condon in
1928,[4] was hailed as a very striking confirmation of quantum theory.
Essentially, the alpha particle escapes from the nucleus by quantum tunnelling
its way out. Gurney and Condon made the following observation in their paper on
it:
     It has hitherto been necessary to postulate some special arbitrary
     âinstabilityâ of the nucleus; but in the following note it is
     pointed out that disintegration is a natural consequence of the laws
     of quantum mechanics without any special hypothesis... Much has been
     written of the explosive violence with which the α-particle is hurled
     from its place in the nucleus. But from the process pictured above,
     one would rather say that the α-particle almost slips away unnoticed.
     [4]
The theory supposes that the alpha particle can be considered an independent
particle within a nucleus that is in constant motion, but held within the
nucleus by nuclear forces. At each collision with the potential barrier of the
nuclear force, there is a small non-zero probability that it will tunnel its
way out. An alpha particle with a speed of 1.5×107 m/s within a nuclear
diameter of approximately 10â14 m will collide with the barrier more than
1021 times per second. However, if the probability of escape at each collision
is very small, the half-life of the radioisotope will be very long, since it is
the time required for the total probability of escape to reach 50%. As an
extreme example, the half-life of the isotope bismuth-209 is 1.9 x 1019 years.
The isotopes in beta-decay_stable_isobars that are also stable with regards to
double_beta_decay with mass_number A = 5, A = 8, 143 â¤ A â¤ 155, 160 â¤ A
â¤ 162, and A â¥ 165 are theorized to undergo alpha decay ("5" decay to
helium-4 and a proton or a neutron, and "8" decay to two helium-4, the half-
life of them (helium-5, lithium-5, and beryllium-8) are very short, unlike the
half-life for all other such nuclides with A â¤ 209, which are very long. All
other such nuclides with A â¤ 209 are primordial_nuclides except A = 146).
However, only such nuclides with A = 5, 8, 144, 146, 147, 148, 151, 186, and
â¥ 209 have been observed to alpha decay (the decay has also been searched for
such nuclides with A = 145, 149, 182, 183, 184, 192, 204, and 208). All other
mass numbers (isobars) have exactly one theoretically stable_nuclide).
Working out the details of the theory leads to an equation relating the half-
life of a radioisotope to the decay energy of its alpha particles, a
theoretical derivation of the empirical GeigerâNuttall_law.
***** Uses[edit] *****
Americium-241, an alpha_emitter, is used in smoke_detectors. The alpha
particles ionize air in an open ion_chamber and a small current flows through
the ionized air. Smoke particles from fire that enter the chamber reduce the
current, triggering the smoke detector's alarm.
Alpha decay can provide a safe power source for radioisotope_thermoelectric
generators used for space_probes[5] and were used for artificial_heart
pacemakers.[6] Alpha decay is much more easily shielded against than other
forms of radioactive decay.
Static_eliminators typically use polonium-210, an alpha emitter, to ionize air,
allowing the 'static cling' to dissipate more rapidly.
***** Toxicity[edit] *****
Highly charged and heavy, alpha particles lose their several MeV of energy
within a small volume of material, along a very short mean_free_path. This
increases the chance of double-strand_breaks to the DNA in cases of internal
contamination, when ingested, inhaled, injected or introduced through the skin.
Otherwise, touching an alpha source is typically not harmful, as alpha
particles are effectively shielded by a few centimeters of air, a piece of
paper, or the thin layer of dead skin cells that make up the epidermis;
however, many alpha sources are also accompanied by beta-emitting radio
daughters, and both are often accompanied by gamma photon emission.
RBE relative_biological_effectiveness quantifies the ability of radiation to
cause certain biological effects, notably either cancer or cell-death, for
equivalent radiation exposure. Alpha radiation has high linear_energy_transfer
(LET) coefficient, which is about one ionization of a molecule/atom for every
angstrom of travel by the alpha particle. The RBE has been set at the value of
20 for alpha radiation by various government regulations. The RBE is set at 10
for neutron irradiation, and at 1 for beta_radiation and ionizing photons.
However, the recoil of the parent nucleus (alpha recoil) gives it a significant
amount of energy, which also causes ionization damage (see ionizing_radiation).
This energy is roughly the weight of the alpha (4 u) divided by the weight of
the parent (typically about 200 u) times the total energy of the alpha. By some
estimates, this might account for most of the internal radiation damage, as the
recoil nucleus is part of an atom that is much larger than an alpha particle,
and causes a very dense trail of ionization; the atom is typically a heavy
metal, which preferentially collect on the chromosomes. In some studies,[7]
this has resulted in an RBE approaching 1,000 instead of the value used in
governmental regulations.
The largest natural contributor to public radiation dose is radon, a naturally
occurring, radioactive gas found in soil and rock.[8] If the gas is inhaled,
some of the radon particles may attach to the inner lining of the lung. These
particles continue to decay, emitting alpha particles, which can damage cells
in the lung tissue.[9] The death of Marie_Curie at age 66 from aplastic_anemia
was probably caused by prolonged exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation,
but it is not clear if this was due to alpha radiation or X-rays. Curie worked
extensively with radium, which decays into radon,[10] along with other
radioactive materials that emit beta and gamma_rays. However, Curie also worked
with unshielded X-ray tubes during World War I, and analysis of her skeleton
during a reburial showed a relatively low level of radioisotope burden.
The Russian dissident Alexander_Litvinenko's 2006 murder by radiation_poisoning
is thought to have been carried out with polonium-210, an alpha emitter.
