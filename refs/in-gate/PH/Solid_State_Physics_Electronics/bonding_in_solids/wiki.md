****** Bonding in solids ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Solids can be classified according to the nature of the bonding between their
atomic or molecular components. The traditional classification distinguishes
four kinds of bonding:[1]
    * Covalent_bonding, which forms network_covalent_solids (sometimes called
      simply "covalent solids")
    * Ionic_bonding, which forms ionic_solids
    * Metallic_bonding, which forms metallic_solids
    * Weak_inter_molecular_bonding, which forms molecular_solids (sometimes
      anomalously called "covalent solids")
Typical members of these classes have distinctive electron distributions, [2]
thermodynamic, electronic, and mechanical properties. In particular, the
binding energies of these interactions vary widely. Bonding in solids can be of
mixed or intermediate kinds, however, hence not all solids have the typical
properties of a particular class, and some can be described as intermediate
forms.

***** Basic classes of solids[edit] *****
**** Network covalent solids[edit] ****
See also: Network_solid
A network covalent solid consists of atoms held together by a network of
covalent_bonds (pairs of electrons shared between atoms of similar
electronegativity), and hence can be regarded as a single, large molecule. The
classic example is diamond; other examples include silicon,[3] quartz and
graphite.
*** Properties[edit] ***
    * High strength (with the exception of graphite)
    * High elastic_modulus
    * High melting_point
    * Brittle
Their strength, stiffness, and high melting points are consequences of the
strength and stiffness of the covalent_bonds that hold them together. They are
also characteristically brittle because the directional nature of covalent
bonds strongly resists the shearing motions associated with plastic flow, and
are, in effect, broken when shear occurs. This property results in brittleness
for reasons studied in the field of fracture_mechanics. Network covalent solids
vary from insulating to semiconducting in their behavior, depending on the band
gap of the material.
**** Ionic solids[edit] ****
A standard ionic_solid consists of atoms held together by ionic_bonds, that is
by the electrostatic attraction of opposite charges (the result of transferring
electrons from atoms with lower electronegativity to atoms with higher
electronegativity). Among the ionic solids are compounds formed by alkali and
alkaline earth metals in combination with halogens; a classic example is table
salt, sodium_chloride.
Ionic solids are typically of intermediate strength and extremely brittle.
Melting points are typically moderately high, but some combinations of
molecular cations and anions yield an ionic_liquid with a freezing point below
room temperature. Vapour pressures in all instances are extraordinarily low;
this is a consequence of the large energy required to move a bare charge (or
charge pair) from an ionic medium into free space.
**** Metallic solids[edit] ****
Metallic_solids are held together by a high density of shared, delocalized
electrons, resulting in metallic_bonding. Classic examples are metals such as
copper and aluminum, but some materials are metals in an electronic sense but
have negligible metallic bonding in a mechanical or thermodynamic sense (see
intermediate_forms). Metallic solids have, by definition, no band gap at the
Fermi_level and hence are conducting.
Solids with purely metallic bonding are characteristically ductile and, in
their pure forms, have low strength; melting points can be very low (e.g.,
Mercury melts at 234 K (â39 Â°C). These properties are consequences of the
non-directional and non-polar nature of metallic bonding, which allows atoms
(and planes of atoms in a crystal lattice) to move past one another without
disrupting their bonding interactions. Metals can be strengthened by
introducing crystal defects (for example, by alloying) that interfere with the
motion of dislocations that mediate plastic deformation. Further, some
transition metals exhibit directional bonding in addition to metallic bonding;
this increases shear strength and reduces ductility, imparting some of the
characteristics of a covalent solid (an intermediate_case below).
**** Molecular solids[edit] ****
A classic molecular_solid consists of small, non-polar covalent molecules, and
is held together by London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces); a classic
example is paraffin_wax. These forces are weak, resulting in pairwise
interatomic binding energies on the order of 1/100 those of covalent, ionic,
and metallic bonds. Binding energies tend to increase with increasing molecular
size and polarity (see intermediate_forms).
Solids that are composed of small, weakly bound molecules are mechanically weak
and have low melting points; an extreme case is solid molecular hydrogen, which
melts at 14 K (â259 Â°C). The non-directional nature of dispersion forces
typically allows easy plastic deformation, as planes of molecules can slide
over one another without seriously disrupting their attractive interactions.
Molecular solids are typically insulators with large band gaps.
***** Solids of intermediate kinds[edit] *****
The four classes of solids permit six pairwise intermediate forms:
**** Ionic to network covalent[edit] ****
Covalent and ionic bonding form a continuum, with ionic character increasing
with increasing difference in the electronegativity of the participating atoms.
Covalent bonding corresponds to sharing of a pair of electrons between two
atoms of essentially equal electronegativity (for example, CâC and CâH
bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbons). As bonds become more polar, they become
increasingly ionic in character. Metal oxides vary along the iono-covalent
spectrum.[4] The SiâO bonds in quartz, for example, are polar yet largely
covalent, and are considered to be of mixed character.[5]
**** Metallic to network covalent[edit] ****
What is in most respects a purely covalent structure can support metallic
delocalization of electrons; metallic carbon_nanotubes are one example.
Transition metals and intermetallic compounds based on transition metals can
exhibit mixed metallic and covalent bonding,[6] resulting in high shear
strength, low ductility, and elevated melting points; a classic example is
tungsten.
**** Molecular to network covalent[edit] ****
Materials can be intermediate between molecular and network covalent solids
either because of the intermediate organization of their covalent bonds, or
because the bonds themselves are of an intermediate kind.
Intermediate organization of covalent bonds:
Regarding the organization of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular
solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The
example given, paraffin_wax, is a member of a family of hydrocarbon molecules
of differing chain lengths, with high-density_polyethylene at the long-chain
end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the
hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the_resulting_fibers rival the strength of
steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not
form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can
become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from Cross-linked
polyethylene, to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids,
to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As
this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and
network covalent solids.
Intermediate kinds of bonding:
A solid with extensive hydrogen bonding will be considered a molecular solid,
yet strong_hydrogen_bonds can have a significant degree of covalent character.
As noted above, covalent and ionic bonds form a continuum between shared and
transferred electrons; covalent and weak bonds form a continuum between shared
and unshared electrons. In addition, molecules can be polar, or have polar
groups, and the resulting regions of positive and negative charge can interact
to produce electrostatic bonding resembling that in ionic solids.
**** Molecular to ionic[edit] ****
A large molecule with an ionized group is technically an ion, but its behavior
may be largely the result of non-ionic interactions. For example, sodium
stearate (the main constituent of traditional soaps) consists entirely of ions,
yet it is a soft material quite unlike a typical ionic solid. There is a
continuum between ionic solids and molecular solids with little ionic character
in their bonding.
**** Metallic to molecular[edit] ****
Metallic solids are bound by a high density of shared, delocalized electrons.
Although weakly bound molecular components are incompatible with strong
metallic bonding, low densities of shared, delocalized electrons can impart
varying degrees of metallic bonding and conductivity overlaid on discrete,
covalently bonded molecular units, especially in reduced-dimensional systems.
Examples include charge_transfer_complexes.
**** Metallic to ionic[edit] ****
The charged components that make up ionic solids cannot exist in the high-
density sea of delocalized electrons characteristic of strong metallic bonding.
Some molecular salts, however, feature both ionic bonding among molecules and
substantial one-dimensional_conductivity, indicating a degree of metallic
bonding among structural components along the axis of conductivity. Examples
include tetrathiafulvalene salts.
