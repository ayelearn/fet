Diagram of the Meissner effect. Magnetic field lines, represented as arrows,
are excluded from a superconductor when it is below its critical temperature.
The Meissner effect (or MeissnerâOchsenfeld effect) is the expulsion of a
magnetic_field from a superconductor during its transition to the
superconducting state. The German physicists Walther_Meissner and Robert
Ochsenfeld[1] discovered this phenomenon in 1933 by measuring the magnetic
field distribution outside superconducting tin and lead samples.[2] The
samples, in the presence of an applied magnetic field, were cooled below their
superconducting_transition_temperature, whereupon the samples cancelled nearly
all interior magnetic fields. They detected this effect only indirectly because
the magnetic flux is conserved by a superconductor: when the interior field
decreases, the exterior field increases. The experiment demonstrated for the
first time that superconductors were more than just perfect conductors and
provided a uniquely defining property of the superconductor state. The ability
for the expulsion effect is determined by the nature of equilibrium formed by
the neutralization within the unit cell of a superconductor.
A superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in
the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic
field is too strong. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according
to how this breakdown occurs. In type-I_superconductors, superconductivity is
abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a
critical value Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an
intermediate state[3] consisting of a baroque_pattern[4] of regions of normal
material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting
material containing no field. In type-II_superconductors, raising the applied
field past a critical value Hc1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the
vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic_flux penetrates the
material, but there remains no resistance to the electric_current as long as
the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength Hc2,
superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is caused by vortices in the
electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by
these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except
niobium and carbon_nanotubes, are type I, while almost all impure and compound
superconductors are type II.

***** Explanation[edit] *****
The Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers
Fritz and Heinz_London, who showed that the electromagnetic free_energy in a
superconductor is minimized provided
          &#x2207;  2    H  =  &#x03BB;  &#x2212; 2    H     {\displaystyle
      \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {H} =\lambda ^{-2}\mathbf {H} \,}  [\nabla ^{2}\mathbf
      {H} =\lambda ^{-2}\mathbf {H} \,]
where H is the magnetic field and Î» is the London_penetration_depth.
This equation, which is known as the London_equation, predicts that the
magnetic field in a superconductor decays_exponentially from whatever value it
possesses at the surface.
In a weak applied field, a superconductor "expels" nearly all magnetic_flux. It
does this by setting up electric currents near its surface. The magnetic field
of these surface currents cancels the applied magnetic field within the bulk of
the superconductor. As the field expulsion, or cancellation, does not change
with time, the currents producing this effect (called persistent_currents) do
not decay with time.
Near the surface, within the London_penetration_depth, the magnetic field is
not completely cancelled. Each superconducting material has its own
characteristic penetration depth.
Any perfect conductor will prevent any change to magnetic flux passing through
its surface due to ordinary electromagnetic_induction at zero resistance. The
Meissner effect is distinct from this: when an ordinary conductor is cooled so
that it makes the transition to a superconducting state in the presence of a
constant applied magnetic field, the magnetic flux is expelled during the
transition. This effect cannot be explained by infinite conductivity. The
placement and subsequent levitation of a magnet above an already
superconducting material does not demonstrate the Meissner effect, while an
initially stationary magnet later being repelled by a superconductor as it is
cooled through its critical temperature does.
***** Perfect diamagnetism[edit] *****
Superconductors in the Meissner state exhibit perfect diamagnetism, or
superdiamagnetism, meaning that the total magnetic field is very close to zero
deep inside them (many penetration depths from the surface). This means that
their magnetic_susceptibility,      &#x03C7;  v     {\displaystyle \chi _{v}}
[\chi _{v}] = â1. Diamagnetics are defined by the generation of a spontaneous
magnetization of a material which directly opposes the direction of an applied
field. However, the fundamental origins of diamagnetism in superconductors and
normal materials are very different. In normal materials diamagnetism arises as
a direct result of the orbital spin of electrons about the nuclei of an atom
induced electromagnetically by the application of an applied field. In
superconductors the illusion of perfect diamagnetism arises from persistent
screening currents which flow to oppose the applied field (the Meissner
effect); not solely the orbital spin.
***** Consequences[edit] *****
The discovery of the Meissner effect led to the phenomenological theory of
superconductivity by Fritz and Heinz_London in 1935. This theory explained
resistanceless transport and the Meissner effect, and allowed the first
theoretical predictions for superconductivity to be made. However, this theory
only explained experimental observationsâit did not allow the microscopic
origins of the superconducting properties to be identified. This was done
successfully by the BCS_theory in 1957, from which the penetration depth and
the Meissner effect result.[5] However, some physicists argue that BCS theory
does not explain the Meissner effect.[6]
    * A tin cylinderâin a Dewar flask filled with liquid heliumâhas been
      placed between the poles of an electromagnet. The magnetic field is about
      8 millitesla (80 G).
    * T = 4.2 K, B = 8 mT (80 G). Tin is in the normally conducting state. The
      compass needles indicate that magnetic flux permeates the cylinder.
    * The cylinder has been cooled from 4.2 K to 1.6 K. The current in the
      electromagnet has been kept constant, but the tin became superconducting
      at about 3 K. Magnetic flux has been expelled from the cylinder (the
      Meissner effect).
***** Paradigm for the Higgs mechanism[edit] *****
The Meissner superconductivity effect serves as an important paradigm for the
generation mechanism of a mass M (i.e. a reciprocal range,      &#x03BB;  M   :
= h  /  ( M c )   {\displaystyle \lambda _{M}:=h/(Mc)}  [{\displaystyle \lambda
_{M}:=h/(Mc)}] where h is the Planck_constant and c is the speed_of_light) for
a gauge_field. In fact, this analogy is an abelian example for the Higgs
mechanism,[7] which generates the masses of the electroweak

W±
 and
Z
 gauge particles in high-energy_physics. The length      &#x03BB;  M
{\displaystyle \lambda _{M}}  [\lambda _{M}] is identical with the London
penetration_depth in the theory of superconductivity.[8][9]
