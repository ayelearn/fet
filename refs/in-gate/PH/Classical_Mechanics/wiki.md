Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from
projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical_objects, such as
spacecraft, planets, stars and galaxies.
If the present state of an object is known it is possible to predict by the
laws of classical mechanics how it will move in the future (determinism) and
how it has moved in the past (reversibility).
The earliest development of classical mechanics is often referred to as
Newtonian mechanics. It consists of the physical concepts employed by and the
mathematical methods invented by Isaac_Newton and Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz and
others in the 17th century to describe the motion of bodies under the influence
of a system of forces.
Later, more abstract methods were developed, leading to the reformulations of
classical mechanics known as Lagrangian_mechanics and Hamiltonian_mechanics.
These advances, made predominantly in the 18th and 19th centuries, extend
substantially beyond Newton's work, particularly through their use of
analytical_mechanics. They are, with some modification, also used in all areas
of modern physics.
Classical mechanics provides extremely accurate results when studying large
objects that are not extremely massive and speeds not approaching the speed_of
light. When the objects being examined have about the size of an atom diameter,
it becomes necessary to introduce the other major sub-field of mechanics:
quantum_mechanics. To describe velocities that are not small compared to the
speed of light, special_relativity is needed. In case that objects become
extremely massive, general_relativity becomes applicable. However, a number of
modern sources do include relativistic mechanics into classical physics, which
in their view represents classical mechanics in its most developed and accurate
form.[note_1]

***** Description of the theory[edit] *****
[diagram_of_parabolic_projectile_motion]
The analysis of projectile motion is a part of classical mechanics.
The following introduces the basic concepts of classical mechanics. For
simplicity, it often models real-world objects as point_particles (objects with
negligible size). The motion of a point particle is characterized by a small
number of parameters: its position, mass, and the forces applied to it. Each of
these parameters is discussed in turn.
In reality, the kind of objects that classical mechanics can describe always
have a non-zero size. (The physics of very small particles, such as the
electron, is more accurately described by quantum_mechanics.) Objects with non-
zero size have more complicated behavior than hypothetical point particles,
because of the additional degrees_of_freedom, e.g., a baseball can spin while
it is moving. However, the results for point particles can be used to study
such objects by treating them as composite objects, made of a large number of
collectively acting point particles. The center_of_mass of a composite object
behaves like a point particle.
Classical mechanics uses common-sense notions of how matter and forces exist
and interact. It assumes that matter and energy have definite, knowable
attributes such as location in space and speed. Non-relativistic mechanics also
assumes that forces act instantaneously (see also Action_at_a_distance).

The position of a point_particle is defined in relation to a coordinate_system
centered on an arbitrary fixed reference point in space called the origin O. A
simple coordinate system might describe the position of a particle P with a
vector notated by an arrow labeled r that points from the origin O to point P.
In general, the point particle does not need to be stationary relative to O. In
cases where P is moving relative to O, r is defined as a function of t, time.
In pre-Einstein relativity (known as Galilean_relativity), time is considered
an absolute, i.e., the time_interval that is observed to elapse between any
given pair of events is the same for all observers.[1] In addition to relying
on absolute_time, classical mechanics assumes Euclidean_geometry for the
structure of space.[2]
*** Velocity and speed[edit] ***
Main articles: Velocity and speed
The velocity, or the rate_of_change of position with time, is defined as the
derivative of the position with respect to time:
          v  =     d   r     d  t        {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\mathrm
      {d} \mathbf {r} \over \mathrm {d} t}\,\!}  [\mathbf {v} ={\mathrm {d}
      \mathbf {r}  \over \mathrm {d} t}\,\!].
In classical mechanics, velocities are directly additive and subtractive. For
example, if one car travels east at 60 km/h and passes another car traveling in
the same direction at 50 km/h, the slower car perceives the faster car as
traveling east at 60 â 50 = 10 km/h. However, from the perspective of the
faster car, the slower car is moving 10 km/h to the west, often denoted as -
10 km/h where the sign implies opposite direction. Velocities are directly
additive as vector_quantities; they must be dealt with using vector_analysis.
Mathematically, if the velocity of the first object in the previous discussion
is denoted by the vector u = ud and the velocity of the second object by the
vector v = ve, where u is the speed of the first object, v is the speed of the
second object, and d and e are unit_vectors in the directions of motion of each
object respectively, then the velocity of the first object as seen by the
second object is
           u  &#x2032;  =  u  &#x2212;  v   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {u}
      '=\mathbf {u} -\mathbf {v} \,.}  [\mathbf {u} '=\mathbf {u} -\mathbf {v}
      \,.]
Similarly, the first object sees the velocity of the second object as
           v &#x2032;   =  v  &#x2212;  u   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {v'}
      =\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {u} \,.}  [\mathbf {v'} =\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {u}
      \,.]
When both objects are moving in the same direction, this equation can be
simplified to
           u  &#x2032;  = ( u &#x2212; v )  d   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {u}
      '=(u-v)\mathbf {d} \,.}  [\mathbf {u} '=(u-v)\mathbf {d} \,.]
Or, by ignoring direction, the difference can be given in terms of speed only:
          u &#x2032;  = u &#x2212; v  .   {\displaystyle u'=u-v\,.}  [u'=u-
      v\,.]
*** Acceleration[edit] ***
Main article: Acceleration
The acceleration, or rate of change of velocity, is the derivative of the
velocity with respect to time (the second_derivative of the position with
respect to time):
          a  =     d   v     d  t    =      d  2     r     d   t  2      .
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} \over \mathrm {d}
      t}={\mathrm {d^{2}} \mathbf {r} \over \mathrm {d} t^{2}}.}  [\mathbf {a}
      ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v}  \over \mathrm {d} t}={\mathrm {d^{2}} \mathbf
      {r}  \over \mathrm {d} t^{2}}.]
Acceleration represents the velocity's change over time. Velocity can change in
either magnitude or direction, or both. Occasionally, a decrease in the
magnitude of velocity "v" is referred to as deceleration, but generally any
change in the velocity over time, including deceleration, is simply referred to
as acceleration.
*** Frames of reference[edit] ***
Main articles: Inertial_frame_of_reference and Galilean_transformation
While the position, velocity and acceleration of a particle can be described
with respect to any observer in any state of motion, classical mechanics
assumes the existence of a special family of reference_frames in which the
mechanical laws of nature take a comparatively simple form. These special
reference frames are called inertial_frames.
An inertial frame is a frame of reference within which an object interacting
with no forces (an idealized situation) appears either at rest or moving
uniformly in a straight line. This is the fundamental definition of an inertial
frame. These are characterized by the requirement that all forces entering the
observer's physical_laws[clarification_needed] originate from identifiable
sources caused by fields, such as electro-static field (caused by static
electrical charges), electro-magnetic field (caused by moving charges),
gravitational field (caused by mass), and so forth.
A key concept of inertial frames is the method for identifying them. For
practical purposes, reference frames that do not accelerate with respect to
distant_stars (an extremely distant point) are regarded as good approximations
to inertial frames. Non-inertial_reference_frames accelerate in relation to an
existing inertial frame. They form the basis for Einstein's relativity. Due to
the relative motion, particles in the non-inertial frame appear to move in ways
not explained by forces from existing fields in the reference frame. Hence, it
appears that there are other forces that enter the equations of motion solely
as a result of the relative acceleration. These forces are referred to as
fictitious_forces, inertia forces, or pseudo-forces.
Consider two reference_frames S and S'. For observers in each of the reference
frames an event has space-time coordinates of (x,y,z,t) in frame S and
(x',y',z',t') in frame S'. Assuming time is measured the same in all reference
frames, and if we require x = x' when t = 0, then the relation between the
space-time coordinates of the same event observed from the reference frames S'
and S, which are moving at a relative velocity of u in the x direction is:
          x &#x2032;  = x &#x2212; u t    {\displaystyle x'=x-ut\,}  [
      {\displaystyle x'=x-ut\,}]
          y &#x2032;  = y    {\displaystyle y'=y\,}  [y'=y\,]
          z &#x2032;  = z    {\displaystyle z'=z\,}  [z'=z\,]
          t &#x2032;  = t  .   {\displaystyle t'=t\,.}  [{\displaystyle
      t'=t\,.}]
This set of formulas defines a group_transformation known as the Galilean
transformation (informally, the Galilean transform). This group is a limiting
case of the PoincarÃ©_group used in special_relativity. The limiting case
applies when the velocity u is very small compared to c, the speed_of_light.
The transformations have the following consequences:
    * vâ² = v â u (the velocity vâ² of a particle from the perspective of
      Sâ² is slower by u than its velocity v from the perspective of S)
    * aâ² = a (the acceleration of a particle is the same in any inertial
      reference frame)
    * Fâ² = F (the force on a particle is the same in any inertial reference
      frame)
    * the speed_of_light is not a constant in classical mechanics, nor does the
      special position given to the speed of light in relativistic_mechanics
      have a counterpart in classical mechanics.
For some problems, it is convenient to use rotating coordinates (reference
frames). Thereby one can either keep a mapping to a convenient inertial frame,
or introduce additionally a fictitious centrifugal_force and Coriolis_force.
**** Forces; Newton's second law[edit] ****
Main articles: Force and Newton's_laws_of_motion
Newton was the first to mathematically express the relationship between force
and momentum. Some physicists interpret Newton's_second_law_of_motion as a
definition of force and mass, while others consider it a fundamental postulate,
a law of nature.[3] Either interpretation has the same mathematical
consequences, historically known as "Newton's Second Law":
          F  =     d   p     d  t    =     d  ( m  v  )    d  t    .
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} \over \mathrm {d}
      t}={\mathrm {d} (m\mathbf {v} ) \over \mathrm {d} t}.}  [\mathbf {F} =
      {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p}  \over \mathrm {d} t}={\mathrm {d} (m\mathbf {v}
      ) \over \mathrm {d} t}.]
The quantity mv is called the (canonical) momentum. The net force on a particle
is thus equal to the rate of change of the momentum of the particle with time.
Since the definition of acceleration is a = dv/dt, the second law can be
written in the simplified and more familiar form:
          F  = m  a   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} \,.}
      [\mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} \,.]
So long as the force acting on a particle is known, Newton's second law is
sufficient to describe the motion of a particle. Once independent relations for
each force acting on a particle are available, they can be substituted into
Newton's second law to obtain an ordinary_differential_equation, which is
called the equation of motion.
As an example, assume that friction is the only force acting on the particle,
and that it may be modeled as a function of the velocity of the particle, for
example:
           F    R    = &#x2212; &#x03BB;  v   ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _
      {\rm {R}}=-\lambda \mathbf {v} \,,}  [\mathbf {F} _{\rm {R}}=-\lambda
      \mathbf {v} \,,]
where Î» is a positive constant, the negative sign states that the force is
opposite the sense of the velocity. Then the equation of motion is
         &#x2212; &#x03BB;  v  = m  a  = m     d   v     d  t     .
      {\displaystyle -\lambda \mathbf {v} =m\mathbf {a} =m{\mathrm {d} \mathbf
      {v} \over \mathrm {d} t}\,.}  [-\lambda \mathbf {v} =m\mathbf {a} =m
      {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v}  \over \mathrm {d} t}\,.]
This can be integrated to obtain
          v  =   v   0    e    &#x2212; &#x03BB; t  m      {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {v} _{0}e^{\frac {-\lambda t}{m}}}  [{\displaystyle
      \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {v} _{0}e^{\frac {-\lambda t}{m}}}]
where v0 is the initial velocity. This means that the velocity of this particle
decays_exponentially to zero as time progresses. In this case, an equivalent
viewpoint is that the kinetic energy of the particle is absorbed by friction
(which converts it to heat energy in accordance with the conservation_of
energy), and the particle is slowing down. This expression can be further
integrated to obtain the position r of the particle as a function of time.
Important forces include the gravitational_force and the Lorentz_force for
electromagnetism. In addition, Newton's_third_law can sometimes be used to
deduce the forces acting on a particle: if it is known that particle A exerts a
force F on another particle B, it follows that B must exert an equal and
opposite reaction force, âF, on A. The strong form of Newton's third law
requires that F and âF act along the line connecting A and B, while the weak
form does not. Illustrations of the weak form of Newton's third law are often
found for magnetic forces.[clarification_needed]
**** Work and energy[edit] ****
Main articles: Work_(physics), kinetic_energy, and potential_energy
If a constant force F is applied to a particle that makes a displacement Îr,
[note_2] the work done by the force is defined as the scalar_product of the
force and displacement vectors:
         W =  F  &#x22C5; &#x0394;  r   .   {\displaystyle W=\mathbf {F} \cdot
      \Delta \mathbf {r} \,.}  [W=\mathbf {F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} \,.]
More generally, if the force varies as a function of position as the particle
moves from r1 to r2 along a path C, the work done on the particle is given by
the line_integral
         W =  &#x222B;  C    F  (  r  ) &#x22C5;  d   r   .   {\displaystyle
      W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} \,.}
      [W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} \,.]
If the work done in moving the particle from r1 to r2 is the same no matter
what path is taken, the force is said to be conservative. Gravity is a
conservative force, as is the force due to an idealized spring, as given by
Hooke's_law. The force due to friction is non-conservative.
The kinetic_energy Ek of a particle of mass m travelling at speed v is given by
          E   k    =    1 2    m  v  2    .   {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {k} }=
      {\tfrac {1}{2}}mv^{2}\,.}  [E_{\mathrm {k} }={\tfrac {1}{2}}mv^{2}\,.]
For extended objects composed of many particles, the kinetic energy of the
composite body is the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles.
The workâenergy_theorem states that for a particle of constant mass m, the
total work W done on the particle as it moves from position r1 to r2 is equal
to the change in kinetic_energy Ek of the particle:
         W = &#x0394;  E   k    =  E    k  2      &#x2212;  E    k  1      =
      1 2    m  (   v  2    2   &#x2212;  v  1    2    )   .   {\displaystyle
      W=\Delta E_{\mathrm {k} }=E_{\mathrm {k_{2}} }-E_{\mathrm {k_{1}} }=
      {\tfrac {1}{2}}m\left(v_{2}^{\,2}-v_{1}^{\,2}\right)\,.}  [{\displaystyle
      W=\Delta E_{\mathrm {k} }=E_{\mathrm {k_{2}} }-E_{\mathrm {k_{1}} }=
      {\tfrac {1}{2}}m\left(v_{2}^{\,2}-v_{1}^{\,2}\right)\,.}]
Conservative forces can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function,
known as the potential_energy and denoted Ep:
          F  = &#x2212;  &#x2207;   E   p     .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-
      \mathbf {\nabla } E_{\mathrm {p} }\,.}  [\mathbf {F} =-\mathbf {\nabla }
      E_{\mathrm {p} }\,.]
If all the forces acting on a particle are conservative, and Ep is the total
potential energy (which is defined as a work of involved forces to rearrange
mutual positions of bodies), obtained by summing the potential energies
corresponding to each force
          F  &#x22C5; &#x0394;  r  = &#x2212;  &#x2207;   E   p    &#x22C5;
      &#x0394;  r  = &#x2212; &#x0394;  E   p     .   {\displaystyle \mathbf
      {F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} =-\mathbf {\nabla } E_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot
      \Delta \mathbf {r} =-\Delta E_{\mathrm {p} }\,.}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf
      {F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} =-\mathbf {\nabla } E_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot
      \Delta \mathbf {r} =-\Delta E_{\mathrm {p} }\,.}]
The decrease in the potential energy is equal to the increase in the kinetic
energy
         &#x2212; &#x0394;  E   p    = &#x0394;  E   k    &#x21D2; &#x0394;
      (  E   k    +  E   p    ) = 0  .   {\displaystyle -\Delta E_{\mathrm {p}
      }=\Delta E_{\mathrm {k} }\Rightarrow \Delta (E_{\mathrm {k} }+E_{\mathrm
      {p} })=0\,.}  [{\displaystyle -\Delta E_{\mathrm {p} }=\Delta E_{\mathrm
      {k} }\Rightarrow \Delta (E_{\mathrm {k} }+E_{\mathrm {p} })=0\,.}]
This result is known as conservation of energy and states that the total
energy,
         &#x2211; E =  E   k    +  E   p     ,   {\displaystyle \sum E=E_
      {\mathrm {k} }+E_{\mathrm {p} }\,,}  [\sum E=E_{\mathrm {k} }+E_{\mathrm
      {p} }\,,]
is constant in time. It is often useful, because many commonly encountered
forces are conservative.
**** Beyond Newton's laws[edit] ****
Classical mechanics also describes the more complex motions of extended non-
pointlike objects. Euler's_laws provide extensions to Newton's laws in this
area. The concepts of angular_momentum rely on the same calculus used to
describe one-dimensional motion. The rocket_equation extends the notion of rate
of change of an object's momentum to include the effects of an object "losing
mass".
There are two important alternative formulations of classical mechanics:
Lagrangian_mechanics and Hamiltonian_mechanics. These, and other modern
formulations, usually bypass the concept of "force", instead referring to other
physical quantities, such as energy, speed and momentum, for describing
mechanical systems in generalized_coordinates.
The expressions given above for momentum and kinetic energy are only valid when
there is no significant electromagnetic contribution. In electromagnetism,
Newton's second law for current-carrying wires breaks down unless one includes
the electromagnetic field contribution to the momentum of the system as
expressed by the Poynting_vector divided by c2, where c is the speed_of_light
in free space.
***** Limits of validity[edit] *****
[two_by_two_chart_of_mechanics_for_size_by_speed]
Domain of validity for Classical Mechanics
Many branches of classical mechanics are simplifications or approximations of
more accurate forms; two of the most accurate being general_relativity and
relativistic statistical_mechanics. Geometric_optics is an approximation to the
quantum_theory_of_light, and does not have a superior "classical" form.
When both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply, such as at
the quantum level with many degrees of freedom, quantum_field_theory (QFT) is
of use. QFT deals with small distances and large speeds with many degrees of
freedom as well as the possibility of any change in the number of particles
throughout the interaction. When treating large degrees of freedom at the
macroscopic level, statistical_mechanics becomes useful. Statistical mechanics
describes the behavior of large (but countable) numbers of particles and their
interactions as a whole at the macroscopic level. Statistical mechanics is
mainly used in thermodynamics for systems that lie outside the bounds of the
assumptions of classical thermodynamics. In the case of high velocity objects
approaching the speed of light, classical mechanics is enhanced by special
relativity. In case that objects become extremely heavy (i.e. their
Schwarzschild_radius is not negligibly small for a given application),
deviations from Newtonian mechanics become apparent and can be quantified by
using the Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism. In that case, General
relativity (GR) becomes applicable. However, until now there is no theory of
Quantum_gravity unifying GR and QFT in the sense that it could be used when
objects become extremely small and heavy.[4] [5]
**** The Newtonian approximation to special relativity[edit] ****
In special relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by
          p  =    m  v    1 &#x2212;    v  2    c  2         ,   {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {p} ={\frac {m\mathbf {v} }{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^
      {2}}}}}}\,,}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ={\frac {m\mathbf {v} }{\sqrt
      {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}\,,}]
where m is the particle's rest mass, v its velocity, v is the modulus of v, and
c is the speed of light.
If v is very small compared to c, v2/c2 is approximately zero, and so
          p  &#x2248; m  v   .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} \approx m\mathbf
      {v} \,.}  [\mathbf {p} \approx m\mathbf {v} \,.]
Thus the Newtonian equation p = mv is an approximation of the relativistic
equation for bodies moving with low speeds compared to the speed of light.
For example, the relativistic cyclotron frequency of a cyclotron, gyrotron, or
high voltage magnetron is given by
         f =  f   c       m  0     m  0   +   T  c  2         ,
      {\displaystyle f=f_{\mathrm {c} }{\frac {m_{0}}{m_{0}+{\frac {T}{c^
      {2}}}}}\,,}  [{\displaystyle f=f_{\mathrm {c} }{\frac {m_{0}}{m_{0}+
      {\frac {T}{c^{2}}}}}\,,}]
where fc is the classical frequency of an electron (or other charged particle)
with kinetic energy T and (rest) mass m0 circling in a magnetic field. The
(rest) mass of an electron is 511 keV. So the frequency correction is 1% for a
magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11 kV direct current accelerating voltage.
**** The classical approximation to quantum mechanics[edit] ****
The ray approximation of classical mechanics breaks down when the de_Broglie
wavelength is not much smaller than other dimensions of the system. For non-
relativistic particles, this wavelength is
         &#x03BB; =   h p     {\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {h}{p}}}  [\lambda
      ={\frac {h}{p}}]
where h is Planck's_constant and p is the momentum.
Again, this happens with electrons before it happens with heavier particles.
For example, the electrons used by Clinton_Davisson and Lester_Germer in 1927,
accelerated by 54 V, had a wavelength of 0.167 nm, which was long enough to
exhibit a single diffraction side_lobe when reflecting from the face of a
nickel crystal with atomic spacing of 0.215 nm. With a larger vacuum_chamber,
it would seem relatively easy to increase the angular_resolution from around a
radian to a milliradian and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns
of integrated_circuit computer memory.
More practical examples of the failure of classical mechanics on an engineering
scale are conduction by quantum_tunneling in tunnel_diodes and very narrow
transistor gates in integrated_circuits.
Classical mechanics is the same extreme high_frequency_approximation as
geometric_optics. It is more often accurate because it describes particles and
bodies with rest_mass. These have more momentum and therefore shorter De
Broglie wavelengths than massless particles, such as light, with the same
kinetic energies.
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_classical_mechanics
See also: Timeline_of_classical_mechanics
The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one, making classical mechanics
one of the oldest and largest subjects in science, engineering and technology,
Some Greek_philosophers of antiquity, among them Aristotle, founder of
Aristotelian_physics, may have been the first to maintain the idea that
"everything happens for a reason" and that theoretical principles can assist in
the understanding of nature. While to a modern reader, many of these preserved
ideas come forth as eminently reasonable, there is a conspicuous lack of both
mathematical theory and controlled experiment, as we know it. These later
became decisive factors in forming modern science, and their early application
came to be known as classical mechanics.
In his Elementa super demonstrationem ponderum, medieval mathematician Jordanus
de_Nemore introduced the concept of "positional gravity" and the use of
component forces.
[a_diagram_of_Theory_of_impetus_of_Albert_of_Saxony_with_a_b_c_d]
Three stage Theory_of_impetus according to Albert_of_Saxony.
The first published causal explanation of the motions of planets was Johannes
Kepler's Astronomia_nova, published in 1609. He concluded, based on Tycho
Brahe's observations on the orbit of Mars, that the planet's orbits were
ellipses. This break with ancient_thought was happening around the same time
that Galileo was proposing abstract mathematical laws for the motion of
objects. He may (or may not) have performed the famous experiment of dropping
two cannonballs of different weights from the tower_of_Pisa, showing that they
both hit the ground at the same time. The reality of that particular experiment
is disputed, but he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on
an inclined_plane. His theory of accelerated motion was derived from the
results of such experiments and forms a cornerstone of classical mechanics.
[portrait_of_Isaac_Newton_with_long_hair_looking_left]
Sir Isaac_Newton (1643â1727), an influential figure in the history of physics
and whose three_laws_of_motion form the basis of classical mechanics
Newton founded his principles of natural philosophy on three proposed laws_of
motion: the law_of_inertia, his second law of acceleration (mentioned above),
and the law of action_and_reaction; and hence laid the foundations for
classical mechanics. Both Newton's second and third laws were given the proper
scientific and mathematical treatment in Newton's PhilosophiÃ¦_Naturalis
Principia_Mathematica. Here they are distinguished from earlier attempts at
explaining similar phenomena, which were either incomplete, incorrect, or given
little accurate mathematical expression. Newton also enunciated the principles
of conservation_of_momentum and angular_momentum. In mechanics, Newton was also
the first to provide the first correct scientific and mathematical formulation
of gravity in Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation. The combination of
Newton's laws of motion and gravitation provide the fullest and most accurate
description of classical mechanics. He demonstrated that these laws apply to
everyday objects as well as to celestial objects. In particular, he obtained a
theoretical explanation of Kepler's_laws of motion of the planets.
Newton had previously invented the calculus, of mathematics, and used it to
perform the mathematical calculations. For acceptability, his book, the
Principia, was formulated entirely in terms of the long-established geometric
methods, which were soon eclipsed by his calculus. However, it was Leibniz who
developed the notation of the derivative and integral preferred[4] today.
[photograph_of_William_Rowan_Hamilton_in_looking_left]
Hamilton's greatest contribution is perhaps the reformulation of Newtonian
mechanics, now called Hamiltonian_mechanics.
Newton, and most of his contemporaries, with the notable exception of Huygens,
worked on the assumption that classical mechanics would be able to explain all
phenomena, including light, in the form of geometric_optics. Even when
discovering the so-called Newton's_rings (a wave_interference phenomenon) he
maintained his own corpuscular_theory_of_light.
After Newton, classical mechanics became a principal field of study in
mathematics as well as physics. Several re-formulations progressively allowed
finding solutions to a far greater number of problems. The first notable re-
formulation was in 1788 by Joseph_Louis_Lagrange. Lagrangian mechanics was in
turn re-formulated in 1833 by William_Rowan_Hamilton.
Some difficulties were discovered in the late 19th century that could only be
resolved by more modern physics. Some of these difficulties related to
compatibility with electromagnetic_theory, and the famous MichelsonâMorley
experiment. The resolution of these problems led to the special_theory_of
relativity, often still considered a part of classical mechanics.
A second set of difficulties were related to thermodynamics. When combined with
thermodynamics, classical mechanics leads to the Gibbs_paradox of classical
statistical_mechanics, in which entropy is not a well-defined quantity. Black-
body_radiation was not explained without the introduction of quanta. As
experiments reached the atomic level, classical mechanics failed to explain,
even approximately, such basic things as the energy_levels and sizes of atoms
and the photo-electric_effect. The effort at resolving these problems led to
the development of quantum_mechanics.
Since the end of the 20th century, classical mechanics in physics has no longer
been an independent theory. Instead, classical mechanics is now considered an
approximate theory to the more general quantum mechanics. Emphasis has shifted
to understanding the fundamental forces of nature as in the Standard_model and
its more modern extensions into a unified theory_of_everything.[5] Classical
mechanics is a theory useful for the study of the motion of non-quantum
mechanical, low-energy particles in weak gravitational fields. Also, it has
been extended into the complex_domain where complex classical mechanics
exhibits behaviors very similar to quantum mechanics.[6]
***** Branches[edit] *****
Classical mechanics was traditionally divided into three main branches:
    * Statics, the study of equilibrium and its relation to forces
    * Dynamics, the study of motion and its relation to forces
    * Kinematics, dealing with the implications of observed motions without
      regard for circumstances causing them
Another division is based on the choice of mathematical formalism:
    * Newtonian_mechanics
    * Lagrangian_mechanics
    * Hamiltonian_mechanics
Alternatively, a division can be made by region of application:
    * Celestial_mechanics, relating to stars, planets and other celestial
      bodies
    * Continuum_mechanics, for materials modelled as a continuum, e.g., solids
      and fluids (i.e., liquids and gases).
    * Relativistic_mechanics (i.e. including the special and general theories
      of relativity), for bodies whose speed is close to the speed of light.
    * Statistical_mechanics, which provides a framework for relating the
      microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the
      macroscopic or bulk thermodynamic properties of materials.

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ The notion of "classical" may be somewhat confusing, since this term
      usually refers to the era of classical_antiquity in European_history.
      While many discoveries within the mathematics of that period are
      applicable today and of great use, much of the science that emerged from
      that time has since been superseded by more accurate models. This in no
      way detracts from the science of that time as most of modern physics is
      built directly upon those developments. The emergence of classical
      mechanics was a decisive stage in the development of science, in the
      modern sense of the term. Above all, it is characterized by an insistence
      that more rigor be used to describe the behavior of bodies. Such an
      exacting foundation is only available through mathematical treatment and
      reliance on experiment, rather than speculation. Classical mechanics
      established a way to predict the behavior of objects in a quantitative
      manner and ways to test these predictions through carefully designed
      measurement. The emerging globally cooperative endeavor provided
      increased scrutiny and testing of both theory and experiment. This
      remains a key factor in establishing certainty in knowledge and in
      bringing it to the service of society. History shows how closely the
      health and wealth of a society depend on nurturing this investigative and
      critical approach.

      final positions: Îr = rfinal â rinitial.
