In "The Signal" painting by William_Powell_Frith, a woman sends a signal by
waving a handkerchief
In signal_processing, a signal is a function that conveys information about a
phenomenon.[1] In electronics and telecommunications, it refers to any time
varying voltage, current or electromagnetic_wave that carries information. A
signal may also be defined as an observable change in a quantity.[2]
Any physical quantity that exhibits variation in space or time can be a signal
used, among other possibilities, to share messages between observers.[3]
According to the IEEE_Transactions_on_Signal_Processing, a signal can be audio,
video, speech, image, sonar and radar-related and so on.[4] In a later effort
of redefining a signal,[2] anything that is only a function of space, such as
an image, is excluded from the category of signals. Also, it is stated that a
signal may or may not contain any information.
In nature, signals can be actions done by an organism to alert other organisms,
ranging from the release of plant chemicals to warn nearby plants of a
predator, to sounds or motions made by animals to alert other animals of food.
Signalling occurs in all organisms even at cellular levels, with cell
signaling. Signaling_theory, in evolutionary biology, proposes that a
substantial driver for evolution is the ability for animals to communicate with
each other by developing ways of signaling. In human engineering, signals are
typically provided by a sensor, and often the original form of a signal is
converted to another form of energy using a transducer. For example, a
microphone converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a speaker
does the reverse.[1]
Information_theory serves as the formal study of signals and their content, and
the information of a signal is often accompanied by noise. The term "noise"
refers to unwanted signal modifications, but is often extended to include
unwanted signals conflicting with desired signals (crosstalk). The reduction of
noise is covered in part under the heading of signal_integrity. The separation
of desired signals from background noise is the field of signal_recovery,[5]
one branch of which is estimation_theory, a probabilistic approach to
suppressing random disturbances.
Engineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have led the way in the
design, study, and implementation of systems involving transmission, storage,
and manipulation_of_information. In the latter half of the 20th century,
electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines, specialising
in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals;
electronic_engineering and computer_engineering as examples; while design
engineering developed to deal with functional design of userâmachine
interfaces.

***** Definitions[edit] *****
Definitions specific to sub-fields are common. For example, in information
theory, a signal is a codified message, that is, the sequence of states in a
communication channel that encodes a message. In the context of signal
processing, signals are analog and digital representations of analog physical
quantities.
In terms of their spatial distributions, signals may be categorized as point
source signals (PSSs) and distributed source signals (DSSs).[2]
In a communication system, a transmitter encodes a message to create a signal,
which is carried to a receiver by the communications_channel. For example, the
words "Mary_had_a_little_lamb" might be the message spoken into a telephone.
The telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical signal. The
signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires; at the receiver it
is reconverted into sounds.
In telephone networks, signaling, for example common-channel_signaling, refers
to phone number and other digital control information rather than the actual
voice signal.
Signals can be categorized in various ways. The most common distinction is
between discrete and continuous spaces that the functions are defined over, for
example discrete and continuous time domains. Discrete-time_signals are often
referred to as time_series in other fields. Continuous-time_signals are often
referred to as continuous signals.
A second important distinction is between discrete-valued and continuous-
valued. Particularly in digital_signal_processing, a digital_signal may be
defined as a sequence of discrete values, typically associated with an
underlying continuous-valued physical process. In digital_electronics, digital
signals are the continuous-time waveform signals in a digital system,
representing a bit-stream.
Another important property of a signal is its entropy or information_content.
***** Analog and digital signals[edit] *****
A digital signal has two or more distinguishable waveforms, in this example,
high voltage and low voltages, each of which can be mapped onto a digit.
Characteristically, noise can be removed from digital signals provided it is
not too large.
Two main types of signals encountered in practice are analog and digital. The
figure shows a digital signal that results from approximating an analog signal
by its values at particular time instants. Digital signals are quantized, while
analog signals are continuous.
**** Analog signal[edit] ****
Main article: Analog_signal
An analog signal is any continuous_signal for which the time varying feature of
the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e.,
analogous to another time varying signal. For example, in an analog audio
signal, the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with the
sound_pressure. It differs from a digital_signal, in which the continuous
quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete_values which can only
take on one of a finite number of values.[6][7]
The term analog signal usually refers to electrical_signals; however, analog
signals may use other mediums such as mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic. An
analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's
information. For example, an aneroid_barometer uses rotary position as the
signal to convey pressure information. In an electrical signal, the voltage,
current, or frequency of the signal may be varied to represent the information.
Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often such a signal is a
measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as sound, light,
temperature, position, or pressure. The physical variable is converted to an
analog signal by a transducer. For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in
air pressure (that is to say, sound) strike the diaphragm of a microphone which
induces corresponding electrical fluctuations. The voltage or the current is
said to be an analog of the sound.
**** Digital signal[edit] ****
Main article: Digital_signal
A binary signal, also known as a logic signal, is a digital signal with two
distinguishable levels
A digital signal is a signal that is constructed from a discrete set of
waveforms of a physical quantity so as to represent a sequence of discrete
values.[8][9][10] A logic signal is a digital signal with only two possible
values,[11][12] and describes an arbitrary bit_stream. Other types of digital
signals can represent three-valued_logic or higher valued logics.
Alternatively, a digital signal may be considered to be the sequence of codes
represented by such a physical quantity.[13] The physical quantity may be a
variable electric current or voltage, the intensity, phase or polarization of
an optical or other electromagnetic_field, acoustic pressure, the magnetization
of a magnetic_storage media, etcetera. Digital signals are present in all
digital_electronics, notably computing equipment and data_transmission.
A received digital signal may be impaired by noise and distortions without
necessarily affecting the digits
With digital signals, system noise, provided it is not too great, will not
affect system operation whereas noise always degrades the operation of analog
signals to some degree.
Digital signals often arise via sampling of analog signals, for example, a
continually fluctuating voltage on a line that can be digitized by an analog-
to-digital_converter circuit, wherein the circuit will read the voltage level
on the line, say, every 50 microseconds and represent each reading with a fixed
number of bits. The resulting stream of numbers is stored as digital data on a
discrete-time and quantized-amplitude signal. Computers and other digital
devices are restricted to discrete time.
**** Time discretization[edit] ****
Discrete-time signal created from a continuous signal by sampling
One of the fundamental distinctions between different types of signals is
between continuous and discrete_time. In the mathematical abstraction, the
domain of a continuous-time (CT) signal is the set of real numbers (or some
interval thereof), whereas the domain of a discrete-time (DT) signal is the set
of integers (or some interval). What these integers represent depends on the
nature of the signal; most often it is time.
If for a signal, the quantities are defined only on a discrete set of times, we
call it a discrete-time_signal. A simple source for a discrete time signal is
the sampling of a continuous signal, approximating the signal by a sequence of
its values at particular time instants.
A discrete-time real (or complex) signal can be seen as a function from (a
subset of) the set of integers (the index labeling time instants) to the set of
real (or complex) numbers (the function values at those instants).
A continuous-time real (or complex) signal is any real-valued (or complex-
valued) function which is defined at every time t in an interval, most commonly
an infinite interval.
**** Amplitude quantization[edit] ****
Digital signal resulting from approximation to an analog signal, which is a
continuous function of time
If a signal is to be represented as a sequence of numbers, it is impossible to
maintain exact precision - each number in the sequence must have a finite
number of digits. As a result, the values of such a signal belong to a finite
set; in other words, it is quantized. Quantization is the process of converting
a continuous analog audio signal to a digital signal with discrete numerical
values.
***** Examples of signals[edit] *****
Signals in nature can be converted to electronic signals by various sensors.
Some examples are:
    * Motion. The motion of an object can be considered to be a signal, and can
      be monitored by various sensors to provide electrical signals.[14] For
      example, radar can provide an electromagnetic signal for following
      aircraft motion. A motion signal is one-dimensional (time), and the range
      is generally three-dimensional. Position is thus a 3-vector signal;
      position and orientation of a rigid body is a 6-vector signal.
      Orientation signals can be generated using a gyroscope.[15]
    * Sound. Since a sound is a vibration of a medium (such as air), a sound
      signal associates a pressure value to every value of time and three space
      coordinates. A sound signal is converted to an electrical signal by a
      microphone, generating a voltage signal as an analog of the sound signal,
      making the sound signal available for further signal processing. Sound
      signals can be sampled at a discrete set of time points; for example,
      compact_discs (CDs) contain discrete signals representing sound, recorded
      at 44,100 samples per second; each sample contains data for a left and
      right channel, which may be considered to be a 2-vector signal (since CDs
      are recorded in stereo). The CD encoding is converted to an electrical
      signal by reading the information with a laser, converting the sound
      signal to an optical signal.[16]
    * Images. A picture or image consists of a brightness or color signal, a
      function of a two-dimensional location. The object's appearance is
      presented as an emitted or reflected electromagnetic wave, one form of
      electronic signal. It can be converted to voltage or current waveforms
      using devices such as the charge-coupled_device. A 2D image can have a
      continuous spatial domain, as in a traditional photograph or painting; or
      the image can be discretized in space, as in a raster_scanned digital
      image. Color images are typically represented as a combination of images
      in three primary_colors, so that the signal is vector-valued with
      dimension three.
    * Videos. A video signal is a sequence of images. A point in a video is
      identified by its two-dimensional position and by the time at which it
      occurs, so a video signal has a three-dimensional domain. Analog video
      has one continuous domain dimension (across a scan_line) and two discrete
      dimensions (frame and line).
    * Biological membrane_potentials. The value of the signal is an electric
      potential ("voltage"). The domain is more difficult to establish. Some
      cells or organelles have the same membrane potential throughout; neurons
      generally have different potentials at different points. These signals
      have very low energies, but are enough to make nervous systems work; they
      can be measured in aggregate by the techniques of electrophysiology.
Other examples of signals are the output of a thermocouple, which conveys
temperature information, and the output of a pH_meter which conveys acidity
information.[1]
***** Signal processing[edit] *****
Main article: Signal_processing
Signal transmission using electronic signals
A typical role for signals is in signal processing. A common example is signal
transmission between different locations. The embodiment of a signal in
electrical form is made by a transducer that converts the signal from its
original form to a waveform expressed as a current (I) or a voltage (V), or an
electromagnetic_waveform, for example, an optical_signal or radio_transmission.
Once expressed as an electronic signal, the signal is available for further
processing by electrical devices such as electronic_amplifiers and electronic
filters, and can be transmitted to a remote location by electronic_transmitters
and received using electronic_receivers.
***** Signals and systems[edit] *****
In Electrical_engineering programs, a class and field of study known as
"signals and systems" (S and S) is often seen as the "cut class" for EE
careers, and is dreaded by some students as such. Depending on the school,
undergraduate EE students generally take the class as juniors or seniors,
normally depending on the number and level of previous linear_algebra and
differential_equation classes they have taken.[17]
The field studies input and output signals, and the mathematical
representations between them known as systems, in four domains: Time,
Frequency, s and z. Since signals and systems are both studied in these four
domains, there are 8 major divisions of study. As an example, when working with
continuous time signals (t), one might transform from the time domain to a
frequency or s domain; or from discrete time (n) to frequency or z domains.
Systems also can be transformed between these domains like signals, with
continuous to s and discrete to z.
Although S and S falls under and includes all the topics covered in this
article, as well as Analog_signal_processing and Digital_signal_processing, it
actually is a subset of the field of Mathematical_modeling. The field goes back
to RF over a century ago, when it was all analog, and generally continuous.
Today, software has taken the place of much of the analog circuitry design and
analysis, and even continuous signals are now generally processed digitally.
Ironically, digital signals also are processed continuously in a sense, with
the software doing calculations between discrete signal "rests" to prepare for
the next input/transform/output event.
In past EE curricula S and S, as it is often called, involved circuit analysis
and design via mathematical modeling and some numerical methods, and was
updated several decades ago with Dynamical_systems tools including differential
equations, and recently, Lagrangians. The difficulty of the field at that time
included the fact that not only mathematical modeling, circuits, signals and
complex systems were being modeled, but physics as well, and a deep knowledge
of electrical (and now electronic) topics also was involved and required.
Today, the field has become even more daunting and complex with the addition of
circuit, systems and signal analysis and design languages and software, from
MATLAB and Simulink to NumPy, VHDL, PSpice, Verilog and even Assembly_language.
Students are expected to understand the tools as well as the mathematics,
physics, circuit analysis, and transformations between the 8 domains.
Because mechanical engineering topics like friction, dampening etc. have very
close analogies in signal science (inductance, resistance, voltage, etc.), many
of the tools originally used in ME transformations (Laplace and Fourier
transforms, Lagrangians, sampling theory, probability, difference equations,
etc.) have now been applied to signals, circuits, systems and their components,
analysis and design in EE. Dynamical systems that involve noise, filtering and
other random or chaotic attractors and repellors have now placed stochastic
sciences and statistics between the more deterministic discrete and continuous
functions in the field. (Deterministic as used here means signals that are
completely determined as functions of time).
EE taxonomists are still not decided where S&S falls within the whole field of
signal processing vs. circuit analysis and mathematical modeling, but the
common link of the topics that are covered in the course of study has
brightened boundaries with dozens of books, journals, etc. called Signals and
Systems, and used as text and test prep for the EE, as well as, recently,
computer engineering exams.[18]
