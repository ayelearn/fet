From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

An autotransformer is an electrical transformer with only one winding. The
"auto" (Greek for "self") prefix refers to the single coil acting alone, not to
any kind of automatic_mechanism. In an autotransformer, portions of the same
winding act as both the primary and secondary sides of the transformer. In
contrast, an ordinary transformer has separate primary and secondary_windings
which are not electrically connected.
The winding has at least three taps where electrical connections are made.
Since part of the winding does "double duty", autotransformers have the
advantages of often being smaller, lighter, and cheaper than typical dual-
winding transformers, but the disadvantage of not providing electrical
isolation between primary and secondary circuits. Other advantages of
autotransformers include lower leakage reactance, lower losses, lower
excitation current, and increased VA rating for a given size and mass.[1]
An example of an application of an autotransformer is one style of traveller's
voltage converter, that allows 230 volt devices to be used on 120 volt supply
circuits, or the reverse. An autotransformer with multiple taps may be applied
to adjust voltage at the end of a long distribution circuit to correct for
excess voltage drop; when automatically controlled, this is one example of a
voltage_regulator.

***** Operation[edit] *****
Single-phase tapped autotransformer with output voltage range of 40%â115% of
input
An autotransformer has a single winding with two end terminals, and one or more
terminals at intermediate tap points. It is a transformer in which the primary
and secondary coils have part of their turns in common. The primary voltage is
applied across two of the terminals, and the secondary voltage taken from two
terminals, almost always having one terminal in common with the primary
voltage.[2] Since the volts-per-turn is the same in both windings, each
develops a voltage in proportion to its number of turns. In an autotransformer
part of the current flows directly from the input to the output, and only part
is transferred inductively, allowing a smaller, lighter, cheaper core to be
used as well as requiring only a single winding.[3] However the voltage and
current ratio of autotransformers can be formulated the same as other two-
winding transformers:[1]
            V  1    V  2     =    N  1    N  2     = a   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {V_{1}}{V_{2}}}={\frac {N_{1}}{N_{2}}}=a}  [{\frac {V_{1}}{V_{2}}}={\frac
      {N_{1}}{N_{2}}}=a] (0<V2<V1)
The ampere-turns provided by the upper half:
          F  U   = (  N  1   &#x2212;  N  2   )  I  1   =  (  1 &#x2212;   1 a
      )   N  1    I  1     {\displaystyle F_{U}=(N_{1}-N_{2})I_{1}=\left(1-
      {\frac {1}{a}}\right)N_{1}I_{1}}  [{\displaystyle F_{U}=(N_{1}-N_{2})I_
      {1}=\left(1-{\frac {1}{a}}\right)N_{1}I_{1}}]
The ampere-turns provided by the lower half:
          F  L   =  N  2   (  I  2   &#x2212;  I  1   ) =    N  1   a   (  I  2
      &#x2212;  I  1   )   {\displaystyle F_{L}=N_{2}(I_{2}-I_{1})={\frac {N_
      {1}}{a}}(I_{2}-I_{1})}  [F_{L}=N_{2}(I_{2}-I_{1})={\frac {N_{1}}{a}}(I_
      {2}-I_{1})]
For ampere-turn balance, FU = FL:
          (  1 &#x2212;   1 a    )   N  1    I  1   =    N  1   a   (  I  2
      &#x2212;  I  1   )   {\displaystyle \left(1-{\frac {1}{a}}\right)N_{1}I_
      {1}={\frac {N_{1}}{a}}(I_{2}-I_{1})}  [{\displaystyle \left(1-{\frac {1}
      {a}}\right)N_{1}I_{1}={\frac {N_{1}}{a}}(I_{2}-I_{1})}]
Therefore:
            I  1    I  2     =   1 a     {\displaystyle {\frac {I_{1}}{I_{2}}}=
      {\frac {1}{a}}}  [{\frac {I_{1}}{I_{2}}}={\frac {1}{a}}]
One end of the winding is usually connected in common to both the voltage
source and the electrical_load. The other end of the source and load are
connected to taps along the winding. Different taps on the winding correspond
to different voltages, measured from the common end. In a step-down transformer
the source is usually connected across the entire winding while the load is
connected by a tap across only a portion of the winding. In a step-up
transformer, conversely, the load is attached across the full winding while the
source is connected to a tap across a portion of the winding.
As in a two-winding transformer, the ratio of secondary to primary voltages is
equal to the ratio of the number of turns of the winding they connect to. For
example, connecting the load between the middle and bottom of the
autotransformer will reduce the voltage by 50%. Depending on the application,
that portion of the winding used solely in the higher-voltage (lower current)
portion may be wound with wire of a smaller gauge, though the entire winding is
directly connected.
If one of the center-taps is used for the ground, then the autotransformer can
be used as a balun to convert a balanced_line (connected to the two end taps)
to an unbalanced_line (the side with the ground).
***** Limitations[edit] *****
An autotransformer does not provide electrical isolation between its windings
as an ordinary transformer does; if the neutral side of the input is not at
ground voltage, the neutral side of the output will not be either. A failure of
the isolation of the windings of an autotransformer can result in full input
voltage applied to the output. Also, a break in the part of the winding that is
used as both primary and secondary will result in the transformer acting as an
inductor in series with the load (which under light load conditions may result
in near full input voltage being applied to the output). These are important
safety considerations when deciding to use an autotransformer in a given
application. [4]
Because it requires both fewer windings and a smaller core, an autotransformer
for power applications is typically lighter and less costly than a two-winding
transformer, up to a voltage ratio of about 3:1; beyond that range, a two-
winding transformer is usually more economical. [4]
In three_phase power transmission applications, autotransformers have the
limitations of not suppressing harmonic currents and as acting as another
source of ground_fault currents. A large three-phase autotransformer may have a
"buried" delta winding, not connected to the outside of the tank, to absorb
some harmonic currents.[4]
In practice, losses mean that both standard transformers and autotransformers
are not perfectly reversible; one designed for stepping down a voltage will
deliver slightly less voltage than required if it is used to step up.[citation
needed] The difference is usually slight enough to allow reversal where the
actual voltage level is not critical.
Like multiple-winding transformers, autotransformers use time-varying magnetic
fields to transfer power. They require alternating_currents to operate properly
and will not function on direct_current.
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Power transmission and distribution[edit] ****
Autotransformers are frequently used in power applications to interconnect
systems operating at different voltage classes, for example 132 kV to 66 kV for
transmission. Another application in industry is to adapt machinery built (for
example) for 480 V supplies to operate on a 600 V supply. They are also often
used for providing conversions between the two common domestic mains voltage
bands in the world (100 Vâ130 V and 200 Vâ250 V). The links between the UK
400 kV and 275 kV 'Super_Grid' networks are normally three phase
autotransformers with taps at the common neutral end.
On long rural power distribution lines, special autotransformers with automatic
tap-changing equipment are inserted as voltage_regulators, so that customers at
the far end of the line receive the same average voltage as those closer to the
source. The variable ratio of the autotransformer compensates for the voltage
drop along the line.
A special form of autotransformer called a zig_zag is used to provide grounding
on three-phase systems that otherwise have no connection to ground. A zig-zag
transformer provides a path for current that is common to all three phases (so-
called zero sequence current).
**** Audio system[edit] ****
In audio applications, tapped autotransformers are used to adapt speakers to
constant-voltage audio distribution systems, and for impedance_matching such as
between a low-impedance microphone and a high-impedance amplifier input.
**** Railways[edit] ****
Main article: 25_kV_AC_railway_electrification
In railway applications, it is common to power the trains at 25 kV AC. To
increase the distance between electricity Grid feeder points, they can be
arranged to supply a split-phase 25-0-25 kV feed with the third wire (opposite
phase) out of reach of the train's overhead collector pantograph. The 0 V point
of the supply is connected to the rail while one 25 kV point is connected to
the overhead contact wire. At frequent (about 10 km) intervals, an
autotransformer links the contact wire to rail and to the second (antiphase)
supply conductor. This system increases usable transmission distance, reduces
induced interference into external equipment and reduces cost. A variant is
occasionally seen where the supply conductor is at a different voltage to the
contact wire with the autotransformer ratio modified to suit.[5]
**** Autotransformer starter[edit] ****
Autotransformers can be used as a method of soft_starting induction_motors. One
of the well-known designs of such starters is KorndÃ¶rfer_starter and X-Ray
detectors.
***** Variable autotransformers[edit] *****

Variable Transformer - part of Tektronix 576 Curve Tracer
By exposing part of the winding coils and making the secondary connection
through a sliding brush, a continuously variable turns ratio can be obtained,
allowing for very smooth control of output voltage. The output voltage is not
limited to the discrete voltages represented by actual number of turns. The
voltage can be smoothly varied between turns as the brush has a relatively high
resistance (compared with a metal contact) and the actual output voltage is a
function of the relative area of brush in contact with adjacent windings.[6]
The relatively high resistance of the brush also prevents it from acting as a
short circuited turn when it contacts two adjacent turns. Typically the primary
connection connects to only a part of the winding allowing the output voltage
to be varied smoothly from zero to above the input voltage and thus allowing
the device to be used for testing electrical equipment at the limits of its
specified voltage range.
The output voltage adjustment can be manual or automatic. The manual type is
applicable only for relatively low voltage and is known as a variable AC
transformer (often referred to by the trademark name Variac). These are often
used in repair shops for testing devices under different voltages or to
simulate abnormal line voltages.
The type with automatic voltage adjustment can be used as automatic voltage
regulator, to maintain a steady voltage at the customers' service during a wide
range of line and load conditions. Another application is a lighting dimmer
that doesn't produce the EMI typical of most thyristor dimmers.
**** Variac Trademark[edit] ****
From 1934 to 2002, Variac was a U.S. trademark of General_Radio for a variable
autotransformer intended to conveniently vary the output voltage for a steady
AC input voltage. In 2004, Instrument Service Equipment applied for and
obtained the Variac trademark for the same type of product.[7] Instrument
Service & Equipment reserves all rights of use of the trademark VARIAC for
variable transformers and related devices.
