A diode is a two-terminal electronic_component that conducts current primarily
in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance
in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A diode
vacuum_tube or thermionic diode is a vacuum tube with two electrodes, a heated
cathode and a plate, in which electrons can flow in only one direction, from
cathode to plate. A semiconductor diode, the most commonly used type today, is
a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a pân_junction connected
to two electrical terminals.[5] Semiconductor diodes were the first
semiconductor_electronic_devices. The discovery of asymmetric electrical
conduction across the contact between a crystalline mineral and a metal was
made by German physicist Ferdinand_Braun in 1874. Today, most diodes are made
of silicon, but other materials such as gallium_arsenide and germanium are
used.[6]

***** Main functions[edit] *****
The most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in
one direction (called the diode's forward direction), while blocking it in the
opposite direction (the reverse direction). As such, the diode can be viewed as
an electronic version of a check_valve. This unidirectional behavior is called
rectification, and is used to convert alternating_current (ac) to direct
current (dc). Forms of rectifiers, diodes can be used for such tasks as
extracting modulation from radio signals in radio receivers.
However, diodes can have more complicated behavior than this simple onâoff
action, because of their nonlinear current-voltage characteristics.[7]
Semiconductor diodes begin conducting electricity only if a certain threshold
voltage or cut-in voltage is present in the forward direction (a state in which
the diode is said to be forward-biased). The voltage drop across a forward-
biased diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of
temperature; this effect can be used as a temperature_sensor or as a voltage
reference. Also, diodes' high resistance to current flowing in the reverse
direction suddenly drops to a low resistance when the reverse voltage across
the diode reaches a value called the breakdown_voltage.
A semiconductor diode's currentâvoltage characteristic can be tailored by
selecting the semiconductor_materials and the doping impurities introduced into
the materials during manufacture.[7] These techniques are used to create
special-purpose diodes that perform many different functions.[7] For example,
diodes are used to regulate voltage (Zener_diodes), to protect circuits from
high voltage surges (avalanche_diodes), to electronically tune radio and TV
receivers (varactor_diodes), to generate radio-frequency oscillations (tunnel
diodes, Gunn_diodes, IMPATT_diodes), and to produce light (light-emitting
diodes). Tunnel, Gunn and IMPATT diodes exhibit negative_resistance, which is
useful in microwave and switching circuits.
Diodes, both vacuum and semiconductor, can be used as shot-noise_generators.
***** History[edit] *****
Thermionic (vacuum-tube) diodes and solid-state (semiconductor) diodes were
developed separately, at approximately the same time, in the early 1900s, as
radio receiver detectors.[8] Until the 1950s, vacuum diodes were used more
frequently in radios because the early point-contact semiconductor diodes were
less stable. In addition, most receiving sets had vacuum tubes for
amplification that could easily have the thermionic diodes included in the tube
(for example the 12SQ7 double_diode_triode), and vacuum-tube rectifiers and
gas-filled rectifiers were capable of handling some high-voltage/high-current
rectification tasks better than the semiconductor diodes (such as selenium
rectifiers) that were available at that time.
**** Vacuum tube diodes[edit] ****
Further information: Vacuum_tube_Â§ History_and_development
In 1873, Frederick_Guthrie observed that a grounded, white hot metal ball
brought in close proximity to an electroscope would discharge a positively
charged electroscope, but not a negatively charged electroscope.[9][10]
In 1880, Thomas Edison observed unidirectional current between heated and
unheated elements in a bulb, later called Edison_effect, and was granted a
patent on application of the phenomenon for use in a dc voltmeter.[11][12]
About 20 years later, John_Ambrose_Fleming (scientific adviser to the Marconi
Company and former Edison employee) realized that the Edison effect could be
used as a radio_detector. Fleming patented the first true thermionic diode, the
Fleming_valve, in Britain on November 16, 1904[13] (followed by U.S._Patent
803,684 in November 1905).
Throughout the vacuum tube era, valve diodes were used in almost all
electronics such as radios, televisions, sound systems and instrumentation.
They slowly lost market share beginning in the late 1940s due to selenium
rectifier technology and then to semiconductor diodes during the 1960s. Today
they are still used in a few high power applications where their ability to
withstand transient voltages and their robustness gives them an advantage over
semiconductor devices, and in musical instrument and audiophile applications.
**** Solid-state diodes[edit] ****
In 1874, German scientist Karl_Ferdinand_Braun discovered the "unilateral
conduction" across a contact between a metal and a mineral.[14][15] Jagadish
Chandra_Bose was the first to use a crystal for detecting radio waves in 1894.
[16] The crystal_detector was developed into a practical device for wireless
telegraphy by Greenleaf_Whittier_Pickard, who invented a silicon crystal
detector in 1903 and received a patent for it on November 20, 1906.[17] Other
experimenters tried a variety of other minerals as detectors. Semiconductor
principles were unknown to the developers of these early rectifiers. During the
1930s understanding of physics advanced and in the mid 1930s researchers at
Bell Telephone Laboratories recognized the potential of the crystal detector
for application in microwave technology.[18] Researchers at Bell_Labs, Western
Electric, MIT, Purdue and in the UK intensively developed point-contact diodes
(crystal rectifiers or crystal diodes) during World War II for application in
radar.[18] After World War II, AT&T used these in their microwave towers that
criss-crossed the United States, and many radar sets use them even in the 21st
century. In 1946, Sylvania began offering the 1N34 crystal diode.[19][20][21]
During the early 1950s, junction diodes were developed.
**** Etymology[edit] ****
At the time of their invention, asymmetrical conduction devices were known as
rectifiers. In 1919, the year tetrodes were invented, William_Henry_Eccles
coined the term diode from the Greek_roots di (from Î´Î¯), meaning 'two', and
ode (from á½Î´ÏÏ), meaning 'path'. The word diode, however, as well as
triode, tetrode, pentode, hexode, were already in use as terms of multiplex
telegraphy.[22]
*** Rectifiers[edit] ***
Main article: Rectifier
Although all diodes rectify, the term rectifier is usually applied to diodes
intended for power_supply application in order to differentiate them from
diodes intended for small_signal circuits.
***** Vacuum tube diodes[edit] *****
The symbol for an indirectly heated vacuum tube diode. From top to bottom, the
element names are: plate, cathode, and heater.
A thermionic diode is a thermionic-valve device consisting of a sealed,
evacuated glass or metal envelope containing two electrodes: a cathode and a
plate. The cathode is either indirectly heated or directly heated. If indirect
heating is employed, a heater is included in the envelope.
In operation, the cathode is heated to red heat (800â1000 Â°C). A directly
heated cathode is made of tungsten wire and is heated by current passed through
it from an external voltage source. An indirectly heated cathode is heated by
infrared radiation from a nearby heater that is formed of Nichrome wire and
supplied with current provided by an external voltage source.
The operating temperature of the cathode causes it to release electrons into
the vacuum, a process called thermionic_emission. The cathode is coated with
oxides of alkaline_earth_metals, such as barium and strontium oxides. These
have a low work_function, meaning that they more readily emit electrons than
would the uncoated cathode.
The plate, not being heated, does not emit electrons; but is able to absorb
them.
The alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the
plate. When the plate voltage is positive with respect to the cathode, the
plate electrostatically attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current
of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. When the plate
voltage is negative with respect to the cathode, no electrons are emitted by
the plate, so no current can pass from the plate to the cathode.
***** Semiconductor diodes[edit] *****
Point contact diode (crystal rectifier or crystal diode), type 1N23C. Grid one
quarter inch.
**** Point-contact diodes[edit] ****
Point-contact diodes were developed starting in the 1930s, out of the early
crystal_detector technology, and are now generally used in the 3 to 30
gigahertz range.[18][23][24][25] Point-contact diodes use a small diameter
metal wire in contact with a semiconductor crystal, and are of either non-
welded contact type or welded contact type. Non-welded contact construction
utilizes the Schottky barrier principle. The metal side is the pointed end of a
small diameter wire that is in contact with the semiconductor crystal.[26] In
the welded contact type, a small P region is formed in the otherwise N type
crystal around the metal point during manufacture by momentarily passing a
relatively large current through the device.[27][28] Point contact diodes
generally exhibit lower capacitance, higher forward resistance and greater
reverse leakage than junction diodes.
**** Junction diodes[edit] ****
*** pân junction diode[edit] ***
Main article: pân_diode
A pân junction diode is made of a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon,
but germanium and gallium_arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to
create a region on one side that contains negative charge_carriers (electrons),
called an n-type_semiconductor, and a region on the other side that contains
positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type_semiconductor. When the n-
type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons
occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two
where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion
region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in
it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The
boundary between these two regions, called a pân_junction, is where the
action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical
potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the
cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-
type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons
in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating,
in a sense, an electrical check_valve.
*** Schottky diode[edit] ***
Main article: Schottky_diode
Another type of junction diode, the Schottky_diode, is formed from a
metalâsemiconductor_junction rather than a pân junction, which reduces
capacitance and increases switching speed.[29][30]
**** Currentâvoltage characteristic[edit] ****
IâV (current vs. voltage) characteristics of a pân junction diode
A semiconductor diode's behavior in a circuit is given by its currentâvoltage
characteristic, or IâV graph (see graph below). The shape of the curve is
determined by the transport of charge carriers through the so-called depletion
layer or depletion_region that exists at the pân_junction between differing
semiconductors. When a pân junction is first created, conduction-band
(mobile) electrons from the N-doped region diffuse into the P-doped region
where there is a large population of holes (vacant places for electrons) with
which the electrons "recombine". When a mobile electron recombines with a hole,
both hole and electron vanish, leaving behind an immobile positively charged
donor (dopant) on the N side and negatively charged acceptor (dopant) on the P
side. The region around the pân junction becomes depleted of charge_carriers
and thus behaves as an insulator.
However, the width of the depletion region (called the depletion_width) cannot
grow without limit. For each electronâhole_pair recombination made, a
positively charged dopant ion is left behind in the N-doped region, and a
negatively charged dopant ion is created in the P-doped region. As
recombination proceeds and more ions are created, an increasing electric field
develops through the depletion zone that acts to slow and then finally stop
recombination. At this point, there is a "built-in" potential across the
depletion zone.
A PN_junction diode in forward bias mode, the depletion_width decreases. Both p
and n junctions are doped at a 1e15/cm3 doping level, leading to built-in
potential of ~0.59V. Observe the different Quasi_Fermi_levels for conduction
band and valence band in n and p regions (red curves).
*** Reverse bias[edit] ***
If an external voltage is placed across the diode with the same polarity as the
built-in potential, the depletion zone continues to act as an insulator,
preventing any significant electric current flow (unless electronâhole_pairs
are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see
photodiode). This is called the reverse_bias phenomenon.
*** Forward bias[edit] ***
However, if the polarity of the external voltage opposes the built-in
potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in a substantial
electric current through the pân junction (i.e. substantial numbers of
electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-
in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for
Schottky). Thus, if an external voltage greater than and opposite to the built-
in voltage is applied, a current will flow and the diode is said to be "turned
on" as it has been given an external forward_bias. The diode is commonly said
to have a forward "threshold" voltage, above which it conducts and below which
conduction stops. However, this is only an approximation as the forward
characteristic is smooth (see I-V graph above).
A diode's IâV_characteristic can be approximated by four regions of
operation:
   1. At very large reverse bias, beyond the peak_inverse_voltage or PIV, a
      process called reverse breakdown occurs that causes a large increase in
      current (i.e., a large number of electrons and holes are created at, and
      move away from the pân junction) that usually damages the device
      permanently. The avalanche_diode is deliberately designed for use in that
      manner. In the Zener_diode, the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener
      diode contains a heavily doped pân junction allowing electrons to
      tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction
      band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is "clamped"
      to a known value (called the Zener voltage), and avalanche does not
      occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and
      power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also,
      following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse
      current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking
      capability until the reverse current ceases.
   2. For a bias less than the PIV, the reverse current is very small. For a
      normal PâN rectifier diode, the reverse current through the device in
      the micro-ampere (ÂµA) range is very low. However, this is temperature
      dependent, and at sufficiently high temperatures, a substantial amount of
      reverse current can be observed (mA or more). There is also a tiny
      surface leakage current caused by electrons simply going around the diode
      as though it were an imperfect insulator.
   3. With a small forward bias, where only a small forward current is
      conducted, the currentâvoltage curve is exponential in accordance with
      the ideal diode equation. There is a definite forward voltage at which
      the diode starts to conduct significantly. This is called the knee
      voltage or cut-in voltage and is equal to the barrier_potential of the p-
      n junction. This is a feature of the exponential curve, and appears
      sharper on a current scale more compressed than in the diagram shown
      here.
   4. At larger forward currents the current-voltage curve starts to be
      dominated by the ohmic resistance of the bulk semiconductor. The curve is
      no longer exponential, it is asymptotic to a straight line whose slope is
      the bulk resistance. This region is particularly important for power
      diodes. The diode can be modeled as an ideal diode in series with a fixed
      resistor.
In a small silicon diode operating at its rated currents, the voltage drop is
about 0.6 to 0.7 volts. The value is different for other diode typesâSchottky
diodes can be rated as low as 0.2 V, germanium diodes 0.25 to 0.3 V, and red or
blue light-emitting_diodes (LEDs) can have values of 1.4 V and 4.0 V
respectively.[citation_needed]
At higher currents the forward voltage drop of the diode increases. A drop of 1
V to 1.5 V is typical at full rated current for power diodes.
**** Shockley diode equation[edit] ****
Main article: Shockley_diode_equation
The Shockley ideal diode equation or the diode law (named after the bipolar
junction_transistor co-inventor William_Bradford_Shockley) gives the IâV
characteristic of an ideal diode in either forward or reverse bias (or no
bias). The following equation is called the Shockley ideal diode equation when
n, the ideality factor, is set equal to 1 :
         I =  I   S     (   e    V  D    n  V  T       &#x2212; 1  )
      {\displaystyle I=I_{\mathrm {S} }\left(e^{\frac {V_{\text{D}}}{nV_{\text
      {T}}}}-1\right)}  [{\displaystyle I=I_{\mathrm {S} }\left(e^{\frac {V_
      {\text{D}}}{nV_{\text{T}}}}-1\right)}]
where
      I is the diode current,
      IS is the reverse bias saturation_current (or scale current),
      VD is the voltage across the diode,
      VT is the thermal_voltage, and
      n is the ideality factor, also known as the quality factor or sometimes
      emission coefficient. The ideality factor n typically varies from 1 to 2
      (though can in some cases be higher), depending on the fabrication
      process and semiconductor material and is set equal to 1 for the case of
      an "ideal" diode (thus the n is sometimes omitted). The ideality factor
      was added to account for imperfect junctions as observed in real
      transistors. The factor mainly accounts for carrier_recombination as the
      charge carriers cross the depletion_region.
The thermal_voltage VT is approximately 25.85 mV at 300 K, a temperature close
to "room temperature" commonly used in device simulation software. At any
temperature it is a known constant defined by:
          V  T   =    k T  q    ,   {\displaystyle V_{\text{T}}={\frac {kT}
      {q}}\,,}  [{\displaystyle V_{\text{T}}={\frac {kT}{q}}\,,}]
where k is the Boltzmann_constant, T is the absolute temperature of the pân
junction, and q is the magnitude of charge of an electron (the elementary
charge).
The reverse saturation current, IS, is not constant for a given device, but
varies with temperature; usually more significantly than VT, so that VD
typically decreases as T increases.
The Shockley ideal diode equation or the diode law is derived with the
assumption that the only processes giving rise to the current in the diode are
drift (due to electrical field), diffusion, and thermal
recombinationâgeneration (RâG) (this equation is derived by setting n = 1
above). It also assumes that the RâG current in the depletion region is
insignificant. This means that the Shockley ideal diode equation doesn't
account for the processes involved in reverse breakdown and photon-assisted
RâG. Additionally, it doesn't describe the "leveling off" of the IâV curve
at high forward bias due to internal resistance. Introducing the ideality
factor, n, accounts for recombination and generation of carriers.
Under reverse bias voltages the exponential in the diode equation is
negligible, and the current is a constant (negative) reverse current value of
âIS. The reverse breakdown region is not modeled by the Shockley diode
equation.
For even rather small forward bias voltages the exponential is very large,
since the thermal voltage is very small in comparison. The subtracted '1' in
the diode equation is then negligible and the forward diode current can be
approximated by
         I =  I  S    e    V  D    n  V  T         {\displaystyle I=I_{\text
      {S}}e^{\frac {V_{\text{D}}}{nV_{\text{T}}}}}  [{\displaystyle I=I_{\text
      {S}}e^{\frac {V_{\text{D}}}{nV_{\text{T}}}}}]
The use of the diode equation in circuit problems is illustrated in the article
on diode_modeling.
**** Small-signal behavior[edit] ****
At forward voltages less than the saturation voltage, the voltage versus
current characteristic curve of most diodes is not a straight line. The current
can be approximated by     I =  I  S    e    V  D    n  V  T
{\displaystyle I=I_{\text{S}}e^{\frac {V_{\text{D}}}{nV_{\text{T}}}}}  [
{\displaystyle I=I_{\text{S}}e^{\frac {V_{\text{D}}}{nV_{\text{T}}}}}] as
mentioned in the previous section.
In detector and mixer applications, the current can be estimated by a Taylor's
series.[31] The odd terms can be omitted because they produce frequency
components that are outside the pass band of the mixer or detector. Even terms
beyond the second derivative usually need not be included because they are
small compared to the second order term.[31] The desired current component is
approximately proportional to the square of the input voltage, so the response
is called square_law in this region.[26]:p. 3
**** Reverse-recovery effect[edit] ****
Following the end of forward conduction in a pân type diode, a reverse
current can flow for a short time. The device does not attain its blocking
capability until the mobile charge in the junction is depleted.
The effect can be significant when switching large currents very quickly.[32] A
certain amount of "reverse recovery time" tr (on the order of tens of
nanoseconds to a few microseconds) may be required to remove the reverse
recovery charge Qr from the diode. During this recovery time, the diode can
actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large
constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is
reverse biased. The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the
operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in
the storage-phase.[33] In certain real-world cases it is important to consider
the losses that are incurred by this non-ideal diode effect.[34] However, when
the slew_rate of the current is not so severe (e.g. Line frequency) the effect
can be safely ignored. For most applications, the effect is also negligible for
Schottky_diodes.
The reverse current ceases abruptly when the stored charge is depleted; this
abrupt stop is exploited in step_recovery_diodes for generation of extremely
short pulses.
**** Types of semiconductor diode[edit] ****
Normal (pân) diodes, which operate as described above, are usually made of
doped silicon or germanium. Before the development of silicon power rectifier
diodes, cuprous_oxide and later selenium was used. Their low efficiency
required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7 V
per "cell", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse
voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a
large heat sink (often an extension of the diode's metal substrate), much
larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require.
The vast majority of all diodes are the pân diodes found in CMOS integrated
circuits[citation_needed], which include two diodes per pin and many other
internal diodes.
  Avalanche_diodes
      These are diodes that conduct in the reverse direction when the reverse
      bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically very
      similar to Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes),
      but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This
      occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the pân junction
      causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a
      large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-
      defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between
      the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2 V) and
      the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free
      path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on the
      way through the channel. The only practical difference between the two
      types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.
  Constant_current_diodes
      These are actually JFETs[35] with the gate shorted to the source, and
      function like a two-terminal current-limiting analog to the voltage-
      limiting Zener diode. They allow a current through them to rise to a
      certain value, and then level off at a specific value. Also called CLDs,
      constant-current diodes, diode-connected transistors, or current-
      regulating diodes.
  Crystal_rectifiers_or_crystal_diodes
      These are point-contact diodes.[26] The 1N21 series and others are used
      in mixer and detector applications in radar and microwave receivers.[23]
      [24][25] The 1N34A is another example of a crystal diode.[36]
  Esaki or tunnel_diodes
      These have a region of operation showing negative_resistance caused by
      quantum_tunneling,[37] allowing amplification of signals and very simple
      bistable circuits. Because of the high carrier concentration, tunnel
      diodes are very fast, may be used at low (mK) temperatures, high magnetic
      fields, and in high radiation environments.[38] Because of these
      properties, they are often used in spacecraft.
  Gunn_diodes
      These are similar to tunnel diodes in that they are made of materials
      such as GaAs or InP that exhibit a region of negative_differential
      resistance. With appropriate biasing, dipole domains form and travel
      across the diode, allowing high frequency microwave oscillators to be
      built.
  Light-emitting_diodes (LEDs)
      In a diode formed from a direct_band-gap semiconductor, such as gallium
      arsenide, charge carriers that cross the junction emit photons when they
      recombine with the majority carrier on the other side. Depending on the
      material, wavelengths (or colors)[39] from the infrared to the near
      ultraviolet may be produced.[40] The first LEDs were red and yellow, and
      higher-frequency diodes have been developed over time. All LEDs produce
      incoherent, narrow-spectrum light; "white"_LEDs are actually a blue LED
      with a yellow scintillator coating, or combinations of three LEDs of a
      different color. LEDs can also be used as low-efficiency photodiodes in
      signal applications. An LED may be paired with a photodiode or
      phototransistor in the same package, to form an opto-isolator.
  Laser_diodes
      When an LED-like structure is contained in a resonant_cavity formed by
      polishing the parallel end faces, a laser can be formed. Laser diodes are
      commonly used in optical_storage devices and for high speed optical
      communication.
  Thermal_diodes
      This term is used both for conventional pân diodes used to monitor
      temperature because of their varying forward voltage with temperature,
      and for Peltier_heat_pumps for thermoelectric_heating_and_cooling.
      Peltier heat pumps may be made from semiconductor, though they do not
      have any rectifying junctions, they use the differing behaviour of charge
      carriers in N and P type semiconductor to move heat.
  Photodiodes
      All semiconductors are subject to optical charge_carrier generation. This
      is typically an undesired effect, so most semiconductors are packaged in
      light blocking material. Photodiodes are intended to sense light
      (photodetector), so they are packaged in materials that allow light to
      pass, and are usually PIN (the kind of diode most sensitive to light).
      [41] A photodiode can be used in solar_cells, in photometry, or in
      optical_communications. Multiple photodiodes may be packaged in a single
      device, either as a linear array or as a two-dimensional array. These
      arrays should not be confused with charge-coupled_devices.
  PIN_diodes
      A PIN diode has a central un-doped, or intrinsic, layer, forming a p-
      type/intrinsic/n-type structure.[42] They are used as radio frequency
      switches and attenuators. They are also used as large-volume, ionizing-
      radiation detectors and as photodetectors. PIN diodes are also used in
      power_electronics, as their central layer can withstand high voltages.
      Furthermore, the PIN structure can be found in many power_semiconductor
      devices, such as IGBTs, power MOSFETs, and thyristors.
  Schottky_diodes
      Schottky diodes are constructed from a metal to semiconductor contact.
      They have a lower forward voltage drop than pân junction diodes. Their
      forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1 mA is in the range
      0.15 V to 0.45 V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping
      applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They can also be
      used as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in
      general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority
      carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage
      problems that slow down many other diodesâso they have a faster reverse
      recovery than pân junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower
      junction capacitance than pân diodes, which provides for high switching
      speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as
      switched-mode_power_supply, mixers, and detectors.
  Super barrier diodes
      Super barrier diodes are rectifier diodes that incorporate the low
      forward voltage drop of the Schottky diode with the surge-handling
      capability and low reverse leakage current of a normal pân junction
      diode.
  Gold-doped diodes
      As a dopant, gold (or platinum) acts as recombination centers, which
      helps a fast recombination of minority carriers. This allows the diode to
      operate at signal frequencies, at the expense of a higher forward voltage
      drop. Gold-doped diodes are faster than other pân diodes (but not as
      fast as Schottky diodes). They also have less reverse-current leakage
      than Schottky diodes (but not as good as other pân diodes).[43][44] A
      typical example is the 1N914.
  Snap-off or Step_recovery_diodes
      The term step recovery relates to the form of the reverse recovery
      characteristic of these devices. After a forward current has been passing
      in an SRD and the current is interrupted or reversed, the reverse
      conduction will cease very abruptly (as in a step waveform). SRDs can,
      therefore, provide very fast voltage transitions by the very sudden
      disappearance of the charge carriers.
  Stabistors or Forward Reference Diodes
      The term stabistor refers to a special type of diodes featuring extremely
      stable forward_voltage characteristics. These devices are specially
      designed for low-voltage stabilization applications requiring a
      guaranteed voltage over a wide current range and highly stable over
      temperature.
  Transient_voltage_suppression_diode (TVS)
      These are avalanche diodes designed specifically to protect other
      semiconductor devices from high-voltage transients.[45] Their pân
      junctions have a much larger cross-sectional area than those of a normal
      diode, allowing them to conduct large currents to ground without
      sustaining damage.
  Varicap or varactor diodes
      These are used as voltage-controlled capacitors. These are important in
      PLL (phase-locked_loop) and FLL (frequency-locked_loop) circuits,
      allowing tuning circuits, such as those in television receivers, to lock
      quickly on to the frequency. They also enabled tunable oscillators in
      early discrete tuning of radios, where a cheap and stable, but fixed-
      frequency, crystal oscillator provided the reference frequency for a
      voltage-controlled_oscillator.
  Zener_diodes
      These can be made to conduct in reverse bias (backward), and are
      correctly termed reverse breakdown diodes. This effect, called Zener
      breakdown, occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode to
      be used as a precision voltage reference. The term Zener diode is
      colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly
      speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst
      avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In
      practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are
      connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature
      coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as
      high-voltage Zener diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two
      (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package,
      constitute a transient absorber (or Transorb, a registered trademark).
Other uses for semiconductor diodes include the sensing of temperature, and
computing analog logarithms (see Operational_amplifier_applications#Logarithmic
output).
**** Graphic symbols[edit] ****

The symbol used to represent a particular type of diode in a circuit_diagram
conveys the general electrical function to the reader. There are alternative
symbols for some types of diodes, though the differences are minor. The
triangle in the symbols points to the forward direction, i.e. in the direction
of conventional_current flow.

**** Numbering and coding schemes[edit] ****
There are a number of common, standard and manufacturer-driven numbering and
coding schemes for diodes; the two most common being the EIA/JEDEC standard and
the European Pro_Electron standard:
*** EIA/JEDEC[edit] ***
The standardized 1N-series numbering EIA370 system was introduced in the US by
EIA/JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) about 1960. Most diodes
have a 1-prefix designation (e.g., 1N4003). Among the most popular in this
series were: 1N34A/1N270 (germanium signal), 1N914/1N4148 (silicon signal),
1N400x (silicon 1A power rectifier), and 1N580x (silicon 3A power rectifier).
[46][47][48]
*** JIS[edit] ***
The JIS_semiconductor_designation system has all semiconductor diode
designations starting with "1S".
*** Pro Electron[edit] ***
The European Pro_Electron coding system for active_components was introduced in
1966 and comprises two letters followed by the part code. The first letter
represents the semiconductor material used for the component (A = germanium and
B = silicon) and the second letter represents the general function of the part
(for diodes, A = low-power/signal, B = variable capacitance, X = multiplier, Y
= rectifier and Z = voltage reference); for example:
    * AA-series germanium low-power/signal diodes (e.g., AA119)
    * BA-series silicon low-power/signal diodes (e.g., BAT18 silicon RF
      switching diode)
    * BY-series silicon rectifier diodes (e.g., BY127 1250V, 1A rectifier
      diode)
    * BZ-series silicon Zener diodes (e.g., BZY88C4V7 4.7V Zener diode)
Other common numbering / coding systems (generally manufacturer-driven)
include:
    * GD-series germanium diodes (e.g., GD9) – this is a very old coding system
    * OA-series germanium diodes (e.g., OA47) – a coding_sequence developed by
      Mullard, a UK company
As well as these common codes, many manufacturers or organisations have their
own systems too – for example:
    * HP diode 1901-0044 = JEDEC 1N4148
    * UK military diode CV448 = Mullard type OA81 = GEC type GEX23
***** Related devices[edit] *****
    * Rectifier
    * Transistor
    * Thyristor or silicon controlled rectifier (SCR)
    * TRIAC
    * DIAC
    * Varistor
In optics, an equivalent device for the diode but with laser light would be the
Optical_isolator, also known as an Optical Diode[citation_needed], that allows
light to only pass in one direction. It uses a Faraday_rotator as the main
component.
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Radio demodulation[edit] ****
A simple envelope_demodulator circuit.
The first use for the diode was the demodulation of amplitude_modulated (AM)
radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the
radio article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and
negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose amplitude or envelope is
proportional to the original audio signal. The diode rectifies the AM radio
frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The
audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple filter
and fed into an audio amplifier or transducer, which generates sound waves.
In microwave and millimeter wave technology, beginning in the 1930s,
researchers improved and miniaturized the crystal detector. Point_contact
diodes (crystal diodes) and Schottky_diodes are used in radar, microwave and
millimeter wave detectors.[29]
**** Power conversion[edit] ****
Main article: Rectifier
Schematic of basic ac-to-dc power supply
Rectifiers are constructed from diodes, where they are used to convert
alternating_current (ac) electricity into direct_current (dc). Automotive
alternators are a common example, where the diode, which rectifies the AC into
dc, provides better performance than the commutator or earlier, dynamo.
Similarly, diodes are also used in CockcroftâWalton voltage_multipliers to
convert ac into higher ac voltages.
**** Over-voltage protection[edit] ****
Diodes are frequently used to conduct damaging high voltages away from
sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting)
under normal circumstances. When the voltage rises above the normal range, the
diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in
(stepper_motor and H-bridge) motor_controller and relay circuits to de-energize
coils rapidly without the damaging voltage_spikes that would otherwise occur.
(A diode used in such an application is called a flyback_diode). Many
integrated_circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent
external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes
are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode_types above).
**** Logic gates[edit] ****
Diodes can be combined with other components to construct AND and OR logic
gates. This is referred to as diode_logic.
**** Ionizing radiation detectors[edit] ****
In addition to light, mentioned above, semiconductor diodes are sensitive to
more energetic radiation. In electronics, cosmic_rays and other sources of
ionizing radiation cause noise pulses and single and multiple bit errors. This
effect is sometimes exploited by particle_detectors to detect radiation. A
single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of electron_volts of
energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is deposited in the
semiconductor material. If the depletion layer is large enough to catch the
whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the
particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and
without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc. These semiconductor
radiation detectors need efficient and uniform charge collection and low
leakage current. They are often cooled by liquid_nitrogen. For longer-range
(about a centimetre) particles, they need a very large depletion depth and
large area. For short-range particles, they need any contact or un-depleted
semiconductor on at least one surface to be very thin. The back-bias voltages
are near breakdown (around a thousand volts per centimetre). Germanium and
silicon are common materials. Some of these detectors sense position as well as
energy. They have a finite life, especially when detecting heavy particles,
because of radiation damage. Silicon and germanium are quite different in their
ability to convert gamma_rays to electron showers.
Semiconductor_detectors for high-energy particles are used in large numbers.
Because of energy loss fluctuations, accurate measurement of the energy
deposited is of less use.
**** Temperature measurements[edit] ****
A diode can be used as a temperature measuring device, since the forward
voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon_bandgap
temperature_sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it
might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a
constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse_saturation_current
term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most
diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically â2 mV/ËC
for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for
temperatures above about 20 kelvin. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series,
[49] and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.[50]
**** Current steering[edit] ****
Diodes will prevent currents in unintended directions. To supply power to an
electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a
battery. An uninterruptible_power_supply may use diodes in this way to ensure
that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small
boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one
used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged
from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to
prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from
discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not
running.
Diodes are also used in electronic_musical_keyboards. To reduce the amount of
wiring needed in electronic musical keyboards, these instruments often use
keyboard_matrix_circuits. The keyboard controller scans the rows and columns to
determine which note the player has pressed. The problem with matrix circuits
is that, when several notes are pressed at once, the current can flow backwards
through the circuit and trigger "phantom_keys" that cause "ghost" notes to
play. To avoid triggering unwanted notes, most keyboard matrix circuits have
diodes soldered with the switch under each key of the musical_keyboard. The
same principle is also used for the switch matrix in solid-state pinball
machines.
**** Waveform clipper[edit] ****
Main article: Clipper_(electronics)
Diodes can be used to limit the positive or negative excursion of a signal to a
prescribed voltage.
**** Clamper[edit] ****
Main article: Clamper_(electronics)
This simple diode clamp will clamp the negative peaks of the incoming waveform
to the common rail voltage
A diode clamp_circuit can take a periodic alternating current signal that
oscillates between positive and negative values, and vertically displace it
such that either the positive, or the negative peaks occur at a prescribed
level. The clamper does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal,
it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference
level.
***** Abbreviations[edit] *****
Diodes are usually referred to as D for diode on PCBs. Sometimes the
abbreviation CR for crystal rectifier is used.[51]
