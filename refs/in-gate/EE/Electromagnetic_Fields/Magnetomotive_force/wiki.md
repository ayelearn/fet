In physics, the magnetomotive force (mmf) is a quantity appearing in the
equation for the magnetic_flux in a magnetic_circuit, often called Ohm's_law
for_magnetic_circuits.[1] It is the property of certain substances or phenomena
that give rise to magnetic_fields:
           F   = &#x03A6;   R   ,   {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}=\Phi
      {\mathcal {R}},}  [{\mathcal  {F}}=\Phi {\mathcal  {R}},]
where Î¦ is the magnetic flux and R is the reluctance of the circuit. It can be
seen that the magnetomotive force plays a role in this equation analogous to
the voltage V in Ohm's_law: V = IR, since it is the cause of magnetic flux in a
magnetic circuit:[2]
   1. â± = NI
            where N is the number of turns in the coil and I is the electric
            current through the circuit.
   2. â± = Î¦R
            where Î¦ is the magnetic_flux and R is the magnetic_reluctance
   3. â± = HL
            where H is the magnetizing force (the strength of the magnetizing
            field) and L is the mean length of a solenoid or the circumference
            of a toroid.

***** Units[edit] *****
The SI_unit of mmf is the ampere, the same as the unit of current (analogously
the units of emf and voltage are both the volt). Informally, and frequently,
this unit is stated as the ampere-turn to avoid confusion with current. This
was the unit name in the MKS_system. Occasionally, the cgs_system unit of the
gilbert may also be encountered.
***** History[edit] *****
The term magnetomotive force was coined by Henry_Augustus_Rowland in 1880.
Rowland intended this to indicate a direct analogy with electromotive_force.[3]
The idea of a magnetic analogy to electromotive force can be found much earlier
in the work of Michael_Faraday (1791-1867) and it is hinted at by James_Clerk
Maxwell (1831-1879). However, Rowland coined the term and was the first to make
explicit an Ohm's_law_for_magnetic_circuits in 1873.[4]
Ohm's law for magnetic circuits is sometimes referred to as Hopkinson's law
rather than Rowland's law as some authors attribute the law to John_Hopkinson
instead of Rowland.[5] According to a review of magnetic circuit analysis
methods this is an incorrect attribution originating from an 1885 paper by
Hopkinson.[6] Furthermore, Hopkinson actually cites Rowland's 1873 paper in
this work.[7]
