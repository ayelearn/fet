In electromagnetism and electronics, inductance describes the tendency of an
electrical_conductor, such as coil, to oppose a change in the electric_current
through it. When an electric current flows through a conductor, it creates a
magnetic_field around that conductor. A changing current, in turn, creates a
changing magnetic field. From Faraday's_law_of_induction, any change in total
magnetic field (magnetic_flux) through a circuit induces an electromotive_force
(voltage) across that circuit, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic_induction.
From Lenz's_law, this induced voltage, or "back EMF" in a circuit, will be in a
direction so as to oppose the change in current which created it. So changes in
current through a conductor will react back on the conductor itself through its
magnetic field, creating a reverse voltage which will oppose any change to the
current. Inductance,     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L], is defined as the ratio
between this induced voltage,     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v], and the rate of
change of the current     i ( t )   {\displaystyle i(t)}  [i(t)] in the
circuit.[1]
         L := &#x2212; v   (    d i   d t    )    &#x2212; 1     &#x21D2;   v =
      &#x2212; L    d i   d t      {\displaystyle L:=-v\left({di \over
      dt}\right)^{\!-1}\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;v=-L{di \over dt}}  [{\displaystyle
      L:=-v\left({di \over dt}\right)^{\!-1}\;\;\Rightarrow \;\;v=-L{di \over
      dt}}]
This proportionality factor L depends on the geometric shape of the circuit
conductors and the magnetic_permeability of nearby materials. An inductor is an
electrical_component which adds inductance to a circuit. It typically consists
of a coil or helix of wire. .
The term inductance was coined by Oliver_Heaviside in 1886.[2] It is customary
to use the symbol     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] for inductance, in honour of
the physicist Heinrich_Lenz.[3][4] In the SI system, the unit of inductance is
the henry (H), which is the amount of inductance which causes a voltage of 1
volt when the current is changing at a rate of one ampere per second. It is
named for Joseph_Henry, who discovered inductance independently of Faraday.[5]

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_electromagnetic_theory
The history of electromagnetic induction, a facet of electromagnetism, began
with observations of the ancients: electric charge or static electricity
(rubbing silk on amber), electric current (lightning), and magnetic attraction
(lodestone). Understanding the unity of these forces of nature, and the
scientific theory of electromagnetism began in the late 18th century.
Electromagnetic induction was first described by Michael_Faraday in 1831.[6][7]
In Faraday's experiment, he wrapped two wires around opposite sides of an iron
ring. He expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of
wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the
opposite side. Using a galvanometer, he observed a transient current flow in
the second coil of wire each time that a battery was connected or disconnected
from the first coil.[8] This current was induced by the change in magnetic_flux
that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected.[9] Faraday found
several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw
transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of
wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near
the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's disk").[10]
***** Source of inductance[edit] *****
A current     i   {\displaystyle i}  [i] flowing through a conductor generates
a magnetic_field around the conductor, which is described by Ampere's_circuital
law. The total magnetic_flux through a circuit     &#x03A6;   {\displaystyle
\Phi }  [\Phi ] is equal to the product of the perpendicular component the
magnetic field and the area of the surface spanning the current path. If the
current varies, the magnetic_flux     &#x03A6;   {\displaystyle \Phi }  [\Phi ]
through the circuit changes. By Faraday's_law_of_induction, any change in flux
through a circuit induces an electromotive_force (EMF) or voltage     v
{\displaystyle v}  [v] in the circuit, proportional to the rate of change of
flux
         v ( t ) = &#x2212;    d &#x03A6; ( t )   d t       {\displaystyle v
      (t)=-{d\Phi (t) \over dt}\,}  [{\displaystyle v(t)=-{d\Phi (t) \over
      dt}\,}]
The negative sign in the equation indicates that the induced voltage is in a
direction which opposes the change in current that created it; this is called
Lenz's_law. The potential is therefore called a back_EMF. If the current is
increasing, the voltage is positive at the end of the conductor through which
the current enters and negative at the end through which it leaves, tending to
reduce the current. If the current is decreasing, the voltage is positive at
the end through which the current leaves the conductor, tending to maintain the
current. Self-inductance, usually just called inductance,     L
{\displaystyle L}  [L] is the ratio between the induced voltage and the rate of
change of the current
          v ( t ) = L    d i   d t      ( 1 )    {\displaystyle \;v(t)=L{di
      \over dt}\qquad \qquad (1)\;}  [{\displaystyle \;v(t)=L{di \over
      dt}\qquad \qquad (1)\;}]
Thus, inductance is a property of a conductor or circuit, due to its magnetic
field, which tends to oppose changes in current through the circuit. The unit
of inductance in the SI system is the henry (H), named after American scientist
Joseph_Henry, which is the amount of inductance which generates a voltage of
one volt when the current is changing at a rate of one ampere per second.
All conductors have some inductance, which may have either desirable or
detrimental effects in practical electrical devices. The inductance of a
circuit depends on the geometry of the current path, and on the magnetic
permeability of nearby materials; ferromagnetic materials with a higher
permeability like iron near a conductor tend to increase the magnetic field and
inductance. Any alteration to a circuit which increases the flux (total
magnetic field) through the circuit produced by a given current increases the
inductance, because inductance is also equal to the ratio of magnetic_flux to
current[11][12][13][14]
         L =    &#x03A6; ( i )  i     {\displaystyle L={\Phi (i) \over i}}  [
      {\displaystyle L={\Phi (i) \over i}}]
An inductor is an electrical_component consisting of a conductor shaped to
increase the magnetic flux, to add inductance to a circuit. Typically it
consists of a wire wound into a coil or helix. A coiled wire has a higher
inductance than a straight wire of the same length, because the magnetic field
lines pass through the circuit multiple times, it has multiple flux_linkages.
The inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns in the
coil.
The inductance of a coil can be increased by placing a magnetic_core of
ferromagnetic material in the hole in the center. The magnetic field of the
coil magnetizes the material of the core, aligning its magnetic_domains, and
the magnetic field of the core adds to that of the coil, increasing the flux
through the coil. This is called a ferromagnetic_core_inductor. A magnetic core
can increase the inductance of a coil by thousands of times.
If multiple electric_circuits are located close to each other, the magnetic
field of one can pass through the other; in this case the circuits are said to
be inductively_coupled. Due to Faraday's_law_of_induction, a change in current
in one circuit can cause a change in magnetic flux in another circuit and thus
induce a voltage in another circuit. The concept of inductance can be
generalized in this case by defining the mutual_inductance      M  j , k
{\displaystyle M_{j,k}}  [{\displaystyle M_{j,k}}] of circuit     j
{\displaystyle j}  [j] and circuit     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] as the ratio
of voltage induced in circuit     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] to the rate of
change of current in circuit     j   {\displaystyle j}  [j]. This is the
principle behind a transformer. The property describing the effect of one
conductor on itself is more precisely called self-inductance, and the
properties describing the effects of one conductor with changing current on
nearby conductors is called mutual inductance.[15]
***** Self-inductance and magnetic energy[edit] *****
If the current through a conductor with inductance is increasing, a voltage
v ( t )   {\displaystyle v(t)}  [v(t)] will be induced across the conductor
with a polarity which opposes the current, as described above (this is in
addition to any voltage drop caused by the conductor's resistance). The charges
flowing through the circuit lose potential energy moving from the higher
voltage to the lower voltage end. The energy from the external circuit required
to overcome this "potential hill" is being stored in the increased magnetic
field around the conductor. Therefore, any inductance with a current through it
stores energy in its magnetic field. At any given time     t   {\displaystyle
t}  [t] the power     p ( t )   {\displaystyle p(t)}  [p(t)] flowing into the
magnetic field, which is equal to the rate of change of the stored energy     U
{\displaystyle U}  [U], is the product of the current     i ( t )
{\displaystyle i(t)}  [i(t)] and voltage     v ( t )   {\displaystyle v(t)}  [v
(t)] across the conductor[16][17][18]
         p ( t ) =    d U   d t    = v ( t ) i ( t )    {\displaystyle p(t)={dU
      \over dt}=v(t)i(t)\,}  [{\displaystyle p(t)={dU \over dt}=v(t)i(t)\,}]
From (1) above
            d U   d t    = L ( i ) i    d i   d t       {\displaystyle {dU
      \over dt}=L(i)i{di \over dt}\,}  [{\displaystyle {dU \over dt}=L(i)i{di
      \over dt}\,}]
         d U = L ( i ) i d i    {\displaystyle dU=L(i)idi\,}  [{\displaystyle
      dU=L(i)idi\,}]
When there is no current, there is no magnetic field and the stored energy is
zero. Neglecting resistive losses, the energy     U   {\displaystyle U}  [U]
(measured in joules, in SI) stored by an inductance with a current     I
{\displaystyle I}  [I] through it is equal to the amount of work required to
establish the current through the inductance from zero, and therefore the
magnetic field. This is given by:
         U =  &#x222B;  0   I   L ( i ) i d i    {\displaystyle U=\int _{0}^
      {I}L(i)idi\,}  [{\displaystyle U=\int _{0}^{I}L(i)idi\,}]
If the inductance     L ( I )   {\displaystyle L(I)}  [{\displaystyle L(I)}] is
constant over the current range, the stored energy is[16][17][18]
         U = L  &#x222B;  0   I   i d i   {\displaystyle U=L\int _{0}^{I}idi}
      [{\displaystyle U=L\int _{0}^{I}idi}]
         U =   1 2   L  I  2     {\displaystyle U={1 \over 2}LI^{2}}  [
      {\displaystyle U={1 \over 2}LI^{2}}]
So therefore inductance is also proportional to how much energy is stored in
the magnetic field for a given current. This energy is stored as long as the
current remains constant. If the current decreases, the magnetic field will
decrease, inducing a voltage in the conductor in the opposite direction,
negative at the end through which current enters and positive at the end
through which it leaves. This will return stored magnetic energy to the
external circuit.
If ferromagnetic materials are located near the conductor, such as in an
inductor with a magnetic_core, the constant inductance equation above is only
valid for linear regions of the magnetic flux, at currents below the level at
which the ferromagnetic material saturates, where the inductance is
approximately constant. If the magnetic field in the inductor approaches the
level at which the core saturates, the inductance will begin to change with
current, and the integral equation must be used.
***** Inductive reactance[edit] *****
The voltage (    v   {\displaystyle v}  [v], blue) and current (i, red)
waveforms in an ideal inductor to which an alternating current has been
applied. The current lags the voltage by 90Â°
When a sinusoidal alternating_current (AC) is passing through a linear
inductance, the induced back-EMF will also be sinusoidal. If the current
through the inductance is     i ( t ) =  I  p   sin &#x2061; ( &#x03C9; t )
{\displaystyle i(t)=I_{p}\sin(\omega t)}  [{\displaystyle i(t)=I_{p}\sin(\omega
t)}], from (1) above the voltage across it will be
             v ( t )    = L    d i   d t    = L   d  d t    [  I  p   sin
      &#x2061; ( &#x03C9; t ) ]       = &#x03C9; L  I  p   cos &#x2061;
      ( &#x03C9; t ) = &#x03C9; L  I  p   sin &#x2061; ( &#x03C9; t +
      &#x03C0; 2   )       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v(t)&=L{di \over
      dt}=L{d \over dt}[I_{p}\sin(\omega t)]\\&=\omega LI_{p}\cos(\omega
      t)=\omega LI_{p}\sin(\omega t+{\pi \over 2})\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v(t)&=L{di \over dt}=L{d \over dt}[I_
      {p}\sin(\omega t)]\\&=\omega LI_{p}\cos(\omega t)=\omega LI_{p}\sin
      (\omega t+{\pi  \over 2})\end{aligned}}}]
where      I  p     {\displaystyle I_{p}}  [I_p] is the amplitude (peak value)
of the sinusoidal current in amperes,     &#x03C9; = 2 &#x03C0; f
{\displaystyle \omega =2\pi f}  [\omega =2\pi f] is the angular_frequency of
the alternating current, with     f   {\displaystyle f}  [f] being its
[frequency]] in hertz, and     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] is the inductance.
Thus the amplitude (peak value) of the voltage across the inductance will be
          V  p   = &#x03C9; L  I  p   = 2 &#x03C0; f L  I  p     {\displaystyle
      V_{p}=\omega LI_{p}=2\pi fLI_{p}}  [{\displaystyle V_{p}=\omega LI_
      {p}=2\pi fLI_{p}}]
Inductive reactance is the opposition of an inductor to an alternating current.
[19] It is defined analogously to electrical_resistance in a resistor, as the
ratio of the amplitude (peak value) of the alternating voltage to current in
the component
          X  L   =    V  p    I  p     = 2 &#x03C0; f L   {\displaystyle X_{L}=
      {V_{p} \over I_{p}}=2\pi fL}  [{\displaystyle X_{L}={V_{p} \over I_
      {p}}=2\pi fL}]
Reactance has units of ohms. It can be seen that inductive_reactance of an
inductor increases proportionally with frequency     f   {\displaystyle f}
[f], so an inductor conducts less current for a given applied AC voltage as the
frequency increases. Because the induced voltage is greatest when the current
is increasing, the voltage and current waveforms are out_of_phase; the voltage
peaks occur earlier in each cycle than the current peaks. The phase difference
between the current and the induced voltage is     &#x03D5; = &#x03C0;  /  2
{\displaystyle \phi =\pi /2}  [{\displaystyle \phi =\pi /2}] radians or 90
degrees, showing that in an ideal inductor the current lags the voltage by
90Â°.
***** Calculating inductance[edit] *****
In the most general case, inductance can be calculated from Maxwell's
equations. Many important cases can be solved using simplifications. Where high
frequency currents are considered, with skin_effect, the surface current
densities and magnetic field may be obtained by solving the Laplace_equation.
Where the conductors are thin wires, self-inductance still depends on the wire
radius and the distribution of the current in the wire. This current
distribution is approximately constant (on the surface or in the volume of the
wire) for a wire radius much smaller than other length scales.
**** Inductance of a straight single wire[edit] ****
A straight single wire has some inductance, which in our ordinary experience is
intangible because it is negligibly small so it can't readily be measured at
low frequencies, and its effect is not detectable. A long straight wire like an
electric transmission line has substantial inductance that reduces its
capacity, and there is no problem at all measuring it. As a practical matter,
longer wires have more inductance, and thicker wires have less, analogous to
their electrical resistance, though the relationships aren't linear nor are
they the same relationships as those quantities bear to resistance. As an
essential component of coils and circuits, understanding what the inductance of
a wire is, is essential. Yet, there is no simple answer.
There is no unambiguous definition of the inductance of a straight wire. If we
consider the wire in isolation we ignore the question of how the current gets
to the wire. That current will affect the flux which is developed in the
vicinity of the wire. But this flux is a part of the definition. A consequence
of Maxwell's equations is that we cannot define the inductance of only a
portion of a circuit, we can only define the inductance of a whole circuit,
which includes how the current gets to the wire and how it returns to the
source. The magnetic flux incident to the whole circuit determines the
inductance of the circuit and of any part of it. The magnetic flux is an
indivisible entity, yet we wish to consider only a part of it, the part
incident to the wire, between whatever we define to be the "ends" of the wire.
The total low frequency inductance (internal plus external) of a straight wire
is:
          L  d c   = 2 l &#x22C5;  [  ln &#x2061; ( 2 l  /  r ) &#x2212; 0.75
      ]    {\displaystyle L_{dc}=2l\cdot \left[\ln(2l/r)-0.75\right]}  [
      {\displaystyle L_{dc}=2l\cdot \left[\ln(2l/r)-0.75\right]}]
where
    *     L  d c     {\displaystyle L_{dc}}  [{\displaystyle L_{dc}}] is the
      "low-frequency" or DC inductance in nanohenries (nH or 10â9H),
    *    l   {\displaystyle l}  [l] is the length of the wire in cm
    *    r   {\displaystyle r}  [r] is the radius of the wire in cm.
This result is based on the assumption that the radius     r   {\displaystyle
r}  [r] is much less than the length     l   {\displaystyle l}  [l], which is
commonly true.
For sufficiently high frequencies skin effects cause the internal inductance to
go to zero and the inductance becomes:
          L  a c   = 2 l &#x22C5;  [  ln &#x2061; ( 2 l  /  r ) &#x2212; 1.00
      ]    {\displaystyle L_{ac}=2l\cdot \left[\ln(2l/r)-1.00\right]}  [
      {\displaystyle L_{ac}=2l\cdot \left[\ln(2l/r)-1.00\right]}]
See.[20]
These inductances are often referred to as "partial inductances" to indicate
that they must be used with care.
In an everyday notion, one conductor of a 100m 18gauge lamp cord, stretched out
straight, would have inductance of about 0.24mH.
**** Mutual inductance of two parallel straight wires[edit] ****
There are two cases to consider: current travels in the same direction in each
wire, and current travels in opposing directions in the wires. Currents in the
wires need not be equal, though they often are, as in the case of a complete
circuit, where one wire is the source and the other the return.
**** Mutual inductance of two wire loops[edit] ****
This is the generalized case of the paradigmatic 2-loop cylindrical coil
carrying a uniform low frequency current; the loops are independent closed
circuits that can have different lengths, any orientation in space, and carry
different currents. None-the-less, the error terms, which are not included in
the integral will only be small if the geometries of the loops are mostly
smooth and convex: they do not have too many kinks, sharp corners, coils,
crossovers, parallel segments, concave cavities or other topological "close"
deformations. A necessary predicate for the reduction of the 3-dimensional
manifold integration formula to a double curve integral is that the current
paths be filamentary circuits, i.e. thin wires where the radius of the wire is
negligible compared to its length.
The mutual inductance by a filamentary circuit     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m]
on a filamentary circuit     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] is given by the double
integral Neumann formula[21]
          L  m , n   =    &#x03BC;  0    4 &#x03C0;        &#x222E;        C  m

**** Self-inductance of a wire loop[edit] ****
Formally, the self-inductance of a wire loop would be given by the above
equation with     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] =     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n].
However, here     1  /   |   x  &#x2212;   x  &#x2032;   |    {\displaystyle 1/
|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {x} '|}  [{\displaystyle 1/|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {x} '|}]
becomes infinite, leading to a logarithmically divergent integral.[23] This
necessitates taking the finite wire radius     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] and
the distribution of the current in the wire into account. There remains the
contribution from the integral over all points and a correction term,[24]

            Y=1/2}  [{\displaystyle Y=1/2}] when the current is homogeneous

            {\displaystyle O\left(\mu _{0}a^{2}/l\right)}]when it is a smooth
            curve. These are small when the wire is long compared to its
            radius.
**** Inductance of a solenoid[edit] ****
A solenoid is a long, thin coil; i.e., a coil whose length is much greater than
its diameter. Under these conditions, and without any magnetic material used,
the magnetic_flux_density     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B] within the coil is
practically constant and is given by
          B =     &#x03BC;  0   N i  l      {\displaystyle \displaystyle B=
      {\frac {\mu _{0}Ni}{l}}}  [{\displaystyle \displaystyle B={\frac {\mu _
      {0}Ni}{l}}}]
where      &#x03BC;  0     {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}  [\mu _{0}] is the magnetic
constant,     N   {\displaystyle N}  [N] the number of turns,     i
{\displaystyle i}  [i] the current and     l   {\displaystyle l}  [l] the
length of the coil. Ignoring end effects, the total magnetic flux through the
coil is obtained by multiplying the flux density     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B]
by the cross-section area     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A]:
          &#x03A6; =     &#x03BC;  0   N i A  l   ,    {\displaystyle
      \displaystyle \Phi ={\frac {\mu _{0}NiA}{l}},}  [{\displaystyle
      \displaystyle \Phi ={\frac {\mu _{0}NiA}{l}},}]
When this is combined with the definition of inductance      L =    N &#x03A6;
i      {\displaystyle \displaystyle L={\frac {N\Phi }{i}}}  [{\displaystyle
\displaystyle L={\frac {N\Phi }{i}}}], it follows that the inductance of a
solenoid is given by:
          L =     &#x03BC;  0    N  2   A  l   .    {\displaystyle
      \displaystyle L={\frac {\mu _{0}N^{2}A}{l}}.}  [{\displaystyle
      \displaystyle L={\frac {\mu _{0}N^{2}A}{l}}.}]
Therefore, for air-core coils, inductance is a function of coil geometry and
number of turns, and is independent of current.
**** Inductance of a coaxial cable[edit] ****
Let the inner conductor have radius      r  i     {\displaystyle r_{i}}  [r_
{i}] and permeability      &#x03BC;  i     {\displaystyle \mu _{i}}  [\mu _
{i}], let the dielectric between the inner and outer conductor have
permeability      &#x03BC;  d     {\displaystyle \mu _{d}}  [\mu _{d}], and let
the outer conductor have inner radius      r  o 1     {\displaystyle r_{o1}}
[r_{{o1}}], outer radius      r  o 2     {\displaystyle r_{o2}}  [r_{{o2}}],
and permeability      &#x03BC;  o     {\displaystyle \mu _{o}}  [\mu _{o}].
However, for a typical coaxial line application, we are interested in passing
(non-DC) signals at frequencies for which the resistive skin_effect cannot be
neglected. In most cases, the inner and outer conductor terms are negligible,
in which case one may approximate
          L &#x2032;  =    d L   d l    &#x2248;    &#x03BC;  d    2 &#x03C0;
      ln &#x2061;    r  o 1    r  i       {\displaystyle L'={\frac {dL}
      {dl}}\approx {\frac {\mu _{d}}{2\pi }}\ln {\frac {r_{o1}}{r_{i}}}}  [L'=
      {\frac {dL}{dl}}\approx {\frac {\mu _{d}}{2\pi }}\ln {\frac {r_{o1}}{r_
      {i}}}]
**** Inductance of multilayer coils[edit] ****
Most practical air-core inductors are multilayer cylindrical coils with square
cross-sections to minimize average distance between turns (circular cross -
sections would be better but harder to form).
**** Magnetic cores[edit] ****
Many inductors include a magnetic_core at the center of or partly surrounding
the winding. Over a large enough range these exhibit a nonlinear permeability
with effects such as magnetic_saturation. Saturation makes the resulting
inductance a function of the applied current.
The secant or large-signal inductance is used in flux calculations. It is
defined as:
          L  s   ( i ) &#xA0;   =    d e f     &#xA0;    N &#x03A6;  i   =
      &#x039B; i     {\displaystyle L_{s}(i)\ {\overset {\underset {\mathrm
      {def} }{}}{=}}\ {\frac {N\Phi }{i}}={\frac {\Lambda }{i}}}  [L_{s}(i)\
      {\overset {\underset {\mathrm {def} }{}}{=}}\ {\frac {N\Phi }{i}}={\frac
      {\Lambda }{i}}]
The differential or small-signal inductance, on the other hand, is used in
calculating voltage. It is defined as:
          L  d   ( i ) &#xA0;   =    d e f     &#xA0;    d ( N &#x03A6; )   d i
      =    d &#x039B;   d i      {\displaystyle L_{d}(i)\ {\overset {\underset
      {\mathrm {def} }{}}{=}}\ {\frac {d(N\Phi )}{di}}={\frac {d\Lambda }{di}}}
      [L_{d}(i)\ {\overset {\underset {\mathrm {def} }{}}{=}}\ {\frac {d(N\Phi
      )}{di}}={\frac {d\Lambda }{di}}]
The circuit voltage for a nonlinear inductor is obtained via the differential
inductance as shown by Faraday's Law and the chain_rule of calculus.
         v ( t ) =    d &#x039B;   d t    =    d &#x039B;   d i       d i   d t
      =  L  d   ( i )    d i   d t      {\displaystyle v(t)={\frac {d\Lambda }
      {dt}}={\frac {d\Lambda }{di}}{\frac {di}{dt}}=L_{d}(i){\frac {di}{dt}}}
      [v(t)={\frac {d\Lambda }{dt}}={\frac {d\Lambda }{di}}{\frac {di}{dt}}=L_
      {d}(i){\frac {di}{dt}}]
Similar definitions may be derived for nonlinear mutual inductance.
***** Mutual inductance[edit] *****
Further information: Coupling_(electronics)
**** Derivation of mutual inductance[edit] ****
The inductance equations above are a consequence of Maxwell's_equations. For
the important case of electrical circuits consisting of thin wires, the
derivation is straightforward.
In a system of K wire loops, each with one or several wire turns, the flux
linkage of loop m, Î»m, is given by
           &#x03BB;  m   =  N  m    &#x03A6;  m   =  &#x2211;  n = 1   K    L
      m , n    i  n   .    {\displaystyle \displaystyle \lambda _{m}=N_{m}\Phi
      _{m}=\sum \limits _{n=1}^{K}L_{m,n}i_{n}.}  [{\displaystyle \displaystyle
      \lambda _{m}=N_{m}\Phi _{m}=\sum \limits _{n=1}^{K}L_{m,n}i_{n}.}]
Here Nm denotes the number of turns in loop m; Î¦m, the magnetic_flux through
loop m; and Lm,n are some constants. This equation follows from Ampere's_law
â magnetic fields and fluxes are linear functions of the currents. By
Faraday's_law of induction, we have
           v  m   =    d  &#x03BB;  m     d t    =  N  m      d  &#x03A6;  m
      d t    =  &#x2211;  n = 1   K    L  m , n      d  i  n     d t    ,
      {\displaystyle \displaystyle v_{m}={\frac {d\lambda _{m}}{dt}}=N_{m}
      {\frac {d\Phi _{m}}{dt}}=\sum \limits _{n=1}^{K}L_{m,n}{\frac {di_{n}}
      {dt}},}  [{\displaystyle \displaystyle v_{m}={\frac {d\lambda _{m}}
      {dt}}=N_{m}{\frac {d\Phi _{m}}{dt}}=\sum \limits _{n=1}^{K}L_{m,n}{\frac
      {di_{n}}{dt}},}]
where vm denotes the voltage induced in circuit m. This agrees with the
definition of inductance above if the coefficients Lm,n are identified with the
coefficients of inductance. Because the total currents Nnin contribute to Î¦m
it also follows that Lm,n is proportional to the product of turns NmNn.
**** Mutual inductance and magnetic field energy[edit] ****
Multiplying the equation for vm above with imdt and summing over m gives the
energy transferred to the system in the time interval dt,
           &#x2211;  m   K    i  m    v  m   d t =  &#x2211;  m , n = 1   K
      i  m    L  m , n   d  i  n     = !    &#x2211;  n = 1   K      &#x2202; W
      ( i )    &#x2202;  i  n      d  i  n   .    {\displaystyle \displaystyle
      \sum \limits _{m}^{K}i_{m}v_{m}dt=\sum \limits _{m,n=1}^{K}i_{m}L_
      {m,n}di_{n}{\overset {!}{=}}\sum \limits _{n=1}^{K}{\frac {\partial
      W\left(i\right)}{\partial i_{n}}}di_{n}.}  [{\displaystyle \displaystyle
      \sum \limits _{m}^{K}i_{m}v_{m}dt=\sum \limits _{m,n=1}^{K}i_{m}L_
      {m,n}di_{n}{\overset {!}{=}}\sum \limits _{n=1}^{K}{\frac {\partial
      W\left(i\right)}{\partial i_{n}}}di_{n}.}]
This must agree with the change of the magnetic field energy, W, caused by the
currents.[25] The integrability_condition
              &#x2202;  2   W   &#x2202;  i  m   &#x2202;  i  n      =
      &#x2202;  2   W   &#x2202;  i  n   &#x2202;  i  m         {\displaystyle
      \displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}W}{\partial i_{m}\partial i_{n}}}=
      {\frac {\partial ^{2}W}{\partial i_{n}\partial i_{m}}}}  [{\displaystyle
      \displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}W}{\partial i_{m}\partial i_{n}}}=
      {\frac {\partial ^{2}W}{\partial i_{n}\partial i_{m}}}}]
requires Lm,n = Ln,m. The inductance matrix, Lm,n, thus is symmetric. The
integral of the energy transfer is the magnetic field energy as a function of
the currents,
          W  ( i )  =   1 2    &#x2211;  m , n = 1   K    i  m    L  m , n    i
      n   .    {\displaystyle \displaystyle W\left(i\right)={\frac {1}{2}}\sum
      \limits _{m,n=1}^{K}i_{m}L_{m,n}i_{n}.}  [{\displaystyle \displaystyle
      W\left(i\right)={\frac {1}{2}}\sum \limits _{m,n=1}^{K}i_{m}L_{m,n}i_
      {n}.}]
This equation also is a direct consequence of the linearity of Maxwell's
equations. It is helpful to associate changing electric currents with a build-
up or decrease of magnetic field energy. The corresponding energy transfer
requires or generates a voltage. A mechanical_analogy in the K = 1 case with
magnetic field energy (1/2)Li2 is a body with mass M, velocity u and kinetic
energy (1/2)Mu2. The rate of change of velocity (current) multiplied with mass
(inductance) requires or generates a force (an electrical voltage).
Circuit diagram of two mutually coupled inductors. The two vertical lines
between the windings indicate that the transformer has a ferromagnetic_core .
"n:m" shows the ratio between the number of windings of the left inductor to
windings of the right inductor. This picture also shows the dot_convention.
Mutual inductance occurs when the change in current in one inductor induces a
voltage in another nearby inductor. It is important as the mechanism by which
transformers work, but it can also cause unwanted coupling between conductors
in a circuit.
The mutual inductance, M, is also a measure of the coupling between two
inductors. The mutual inductance by circuit i on circuit j is given by the
double integral Neumann formula, see calculation_techniques
The mutual inductance also has the relationship:
          M  21   =  N  1    N  2    P  21      {\displaystyle M_{21}=N_{1}N_
      {2}P_{21}\!}  [M_{21}=N_{1}N_{2}P_{21}\!]
where
          M  21     {\displaystyle M_{21}}  [M_{21}] is the mutual inductance,
      and the subscript specifies the relationship of the voltage induced in
      coil 2 due to the current in coil 1.
      N1 is the number of turns in coil 1,
      N2 is the number of turns in coil 2,
      P21 is the permeance of the space occupied by the flux.
Once the mutual inductance, M, is determined, it can be used to predict the
behavior of a circuit:
          v  1   =  L  1      d  i  1     d t    &#x2212; M    d  i  2     d t
      {\displaystyle v_{1}=L_{1}{\frac {di_{1}}{dt}}-M{\frac {di_{2}}{dt}}}
      [v_{1}=L_{1}{\frac {di_{1}}{dt}}-M{\frac {di_{2}}{dt}}]
where
      v1 is the voltage across the inductor of interest,
      L1 is the inductance of the inductor of interest,
      di1/dt is the derivative, with respect to time, of the current through
      the inductor of interest,
      di2/dt is the derivative, with respect to time, of the current through
      the inductor that is coupled to the first inductor, and
      M is the mutual inductance.
The minus sign arises because of the sense the current i2 has been defined in
the diagram. With both currents defined going into the dots the sign of M will
be positive (the equation would read with a plus sign instead).[26]
**** Coupling coefficient[edit] ****
The coupling coefficient is the ratio of the open-circuit actual voltage ratio
to the ratio that would obtain if all the flux coupled from one circuit to the
other. The coupling coefficient is related to mutual inductance and self
inductances in the following way. From the two simultaneous equations expressed
in the 2-port matrix the open-circuit voltage ratio is found to be:[citation
needed]
            V  2    V  1     (  open circuit  ) =   M  L  1
      {\displaystyle {V_{2} \over V_{1}}({\text{open circuit}})={M \over L_
      {1}}}  [{\displaystyle {V_{2} \over V_{1}}({\text{open circuit}})={M
      \over L_{1}}}]
while the ratio if all the flux is coupled is the ratio of the turns, hence the
ratio of the square root of the inductances
            V  2    V  1     (  max coupled  ) =     L  2    L  1
      {\displaystyle {V_{2} \over V_{1}}({\text{max coupled}})={\sqrt {L_{2}
      \over L_{1}}}}  [{\displaystyle {V_{2} \over V_{1}}({\text{max
      coupled}})={\sqrt {L_{2} \over L_{1}}}}]
thus,
         M = k    L  1    L  2       {\displaystyle M=k{\sqrt {L_{1}L_{2}}}}  [
      {\displaystyle M=k{\sqrt {L_{1}L_{2}}}}]
where
      k is the coupling coefficient,
      L1 is the inductance of the first coil, and
      L2 is the inductance of the second coil.
The coupling coefficient is a convenient way to specify the relationship
between a certain orientation of inductors with arbitrary inductance. Most
authors define the range as 0 â¤ k < 1, but some[27] define it as â1 < k <
1. Allowing negative values of k captures phase inversions of the coil
connections and the direction of the windings.[28]
**** Matrix representation[edit] ****
Mutually coupled inductors can be described by any of the two-port_network
parameter matrix representations. The most direct are the z_parameters, which
are given by
         [  z  ] = s   [     L  1   &#xA0; M     M &#xA0;  L  2      ]

T equivalent circuit of mutually coupled inductors
Mutually coupled inductors can equivalently be represented by a T-circuit of
inductors as shown. If the coupling is strong and the inductors are of unequal
values then the series inductor on the step-down side may take on a negative
value.
This can be analyzed as a two port network. With the output terminated with
some arbitrary impedance, Z, the voltage gain, Av, is given by,
          A   v    =    s M Z     s  2    L  1    L  2   &#x2212;  s  2    M  2
      + s  L  1   Z     =   k   s  (  1 &#x2212;  k  2    )      L  1    L  2
      Z   +     L  1    L  2            {\displaystyle A_{\mathrm {v} }={\frac
      {sMZ}{\,s^{2}L_{1}L_{2}-s^{2}M^{2}+sL_{1}Z\,}}={\frac {k}{\,s\left(1-k^
      {2}\right){\frac {\sqrt {L_{1}L_{2}}}{Z}}+{\sqrt {\frac {L_{1}}{L_
      {2}}}}\,}}}  [{\displaystyle A_{\mathrm {v} }={\frac {sMZ}{\,s^{2}L_{1}L_
      {2}-s^{2}M^{2}+sL_{1}Z\,}}={\frac {k}{\,s\left(1-k^{2}\right){\frac
      {\sqrt {L_{1}L_{2}}}{Z}}+{\sqrt {\frac {L_{1}}{L_{2}}}}\,}}}]
where k is the coupling constant and s is the complex_frequency variable, as
above. For tightly coupled inductors where k = 1 this reduces to
          A   v    =     L  2    L  1        {\displaystyle A_{\mathrm {v} }=
      {\sqrt {L_{2} \over L_{1}}}}  [A_{\mathrm {v} }={\sqrt {L_{2} \over L_
      {1}}}]
which is independent of the load impedance. If the inductors are wound on the
same core and with the same geometry, then this expression is equal to the
turns ratio of the two inductors because inductance is proportional to the
square of turns ratio.
The input impedance of the network is given by,
          Z   i n    =     s  2    L  1    L  2   &#x2212;  s  2    M  2   + s
      L  1   Z   s  L  2   + Z    =    L  1    L  2      Z    (     1  1 +
      (   Z   s  L  2       )       )     (   1 +    (  1 &#x2212;  k  2    )
      (   Z   s  L  2       )      )     {\displaystyle Z_{\mathrm {in} }=
      {\frac {s^{2}L_{1}L_{2}-s^{2}M^{2}+sL_{1}Z}{sL_{2}+Z}}={\frac {L_{1}}{L_
      {2}}}\,Z\,{\biggl (}{\frac {1}{1+\left({\frac {Z}{\,sL_{2}\,}}\right)}}
      {\biggr )}{\Biggl (}1+{\frac {\left(1-k^{2}\right)}{\left({\frac {Z}
      {\,sL_{2}\,}}\right)}}{\Biggr )}}  [{\displaystyle Z_{\mathrm {in} }=
      {\frac {s^{2}L_{1}L_{2}-s^{2}M^{2}+sL_{1}Z}{sL_{2}+Z}}={\frac {L_{1}}{L_
      {2}}}\,Z\,{\biggl (}{\frac {1}{1+\left({\frac {Z}{\,sL_{2}\,}}\right)}}
      {\biggr )}{\Biggl (}1+{\frac {\left(1-k^{2}\right)}{\left({\frac {Z}
      {\,sL_{2}\,}}\right)}}{\Biggr )}}]
For k = 1 this reduces to
          Z   i n    =    s  L  1   Z   s  L  2   + Z    =    L  1    L  2
      Z    (     1  1 +  (   Z   s  L  2       )       )     {\displaystyle Z_
      {\mathrm {in} }={\frac {sL_{1}Z}{sL_{2}+Z}}={\frac {L_{1}}{L_{2}}}\,Z\,
      {\biggl (}{\frac {1}{1+\left({\frac {Z}{\,sL_{2}\,}}\right)}}{\biggr )}}
      [{\displaystyle Z_{\mathrm {in} }={\frac {sL_{1}Z}{sL_{2}+Z}}={\frac {L_
      {1}}{L_{2}}}\,Z\,{\biggl (}{\frac {1}{1+\left({\frac {Z}{\,sL_
      {2}\,}}\right)}}{\biggr )}}]
Thus, the current gain, Ai is not independent of load unless the further
condition
          |  s  L  2    |  &#x226B;  |  Z  |    {\displaystyle |sL_{2}|\gg |Z|}
      [|sL_{2}|\gg |Z|]
is met, in which case,
          Z   i n    &#x2248;    L  1    L  2     Z   {\displaystyle Z_{\mathrm
      {in} }\approx {L_{1} \over L_{2}}Z}  [Z_{\mathrm {in} }\approx {L_{1}
      \over L_{2}}Z]

      {\displaystyle A_{\mathrm {i} }\approx {\sqrt {L_{1} \over L_{2}}}={1

*** Ï-circuit[edit] ***
Ï equivalent circuit of coupled inductors
Alternatively, two coupled inductors can be modelled using a Ï equivalent
circuit with optional ideal transformers at each port. While the circuit is
more complicated than a T-circuit, it can be generalized [29] to circuits
consisting of more than two coupled inductors. Equivalent circuit elements Ls,
Lp have physical meaning, modelling respectively magnetic_reluctances of
coupling paths and magnetic_reluctances of leakage_paths. For example, electric
currents flowing through these elements correspond to coupling and leakage
magnetic_fluxes. Ideal transformers normalize all self-inductances to 1 H to
simplify mathematical formulas.
Equivalent circuit element values can be calculated from coupling coefficients
with
          L   S  i j     =     det (  K  )   &#x2212;   C   i j
      {\displaystyle L_{S_{ij}}={\dfrac {\det(\mathbf {K} )}{-\mathbf {C} _
      {ij}}}}  [{\displaystyle L_{S_{ij}}={\dfrac {\det(\mathbf {K} )}{-\mathbf
      {C} _{ij}}}}]
          L   P  i     =     det (  K  )    &#x2211;  j = 1   N     C   i j
      {\displaystyle L_{P_{i}}={\dfrac {\det(\mathbf {K} )}{\sum _{j=1}^
      {N}\mathbf {C} _{ij}}}}  [{\displaystyle L_{P_{i}}={\dfrac {\det(\mathbf
      {K} )}{\sum _{j=1}^{N}\mathbf {C} _{ij}}}}]
where coupling coefficient matrix and its cofactors are defined as
          K  =   [    1    k  12     &#x22EF;    k  1 N        k  12     1

      {\begin{bmatrix}1&k_{12}&\cdots &k_{1N}\\k_{12}&1&\cdots &k_{2N}\\\vdots

      {i+j}\,\mathbf {M} _{ij}.}  [{\displaystyle \quad \mathbf {C} _{ij}=(-1)^

For two coupled inductors, these formulas simplify to
          L   S  12     =     &#x2212;  k  12   2   + 1   k  12
      {\displaystyle L_{S_{12}}={\dfrac {-k_{12}^{2}+1}{k_{12}}}\quad }  [

and for three coupled inductors (for brevity shown only for Ls12 and Lp1)

**** Resonant transformer[edit] ****
Main article: Resonant_inductive_coupling
When a capacitor is connected across one winding of a transformer, making the
winding a tuned_circuit (resonant circuit) it is called a single-tuned
transformer. When a capacitor is connected across each winding, it is called a
double_tuned_transformer. These resonant_transformers can store oscillating
electrical energy similar to a resonant_circuit and thus function as a bandpass
filter, allowing frequencies near their resonant_frequency to pass from the
primary to secondary winding, but blocking other frequencies. The amount of
mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the Q_factor of the
circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The advantage of
the double tuned transformer is that it can have a narrower bandwidth than a
simple tuned circuit. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as
loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of the coupling
coefficient k. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual
inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance
increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is
increased beyond the critical coupling, the peak in the frequency response
curve splits into two peaks, and as the coupling is increased the two peaks
move further apart. This is known as overcoupling.
**** Ideal transformers[edit] ****
When k = 1, the inductor is referred to as being closely coupled. If in
addition, the self-inductances go to infinity, the inductor becomes an ideal
transformer. In this case the voltages, currents, and number of turns can be
related in the following way:
          V  s   =    N  s    N  p      V  p     {\displaystyle V_{\text{s}}=
      {\frac {N_{\text{s}}}{N_{\text{p}}}}V_{\text{p}}}  [V_{\text{s}}={\frac
      {N_{\text{s}}}{N_{\text{p}}}}V_{\text{p}}]
where
      Vs is the voltage across the secondary inductor,
      Vp is the voltage across the primary inductor (the one connected to a
      power source),
      Ns is the number of turns in the secondary inductor, and
      Np is the number of turns in the primary inductor.
Conversely the current:
          I  s   =    N  p    N  s      I  p     {\displaystyle I_{\text{s}}=
      {\frac {N_{\text{p}}}{N_{\text{s}}}}I_{\text{p}}}  [I_{\text{s}}={\frac
      {N_{\text{p}}}{N_{\text{s}}}}I_{\text{p}}]
where
      Is is the current through the secondary inductor,
      Ip is the current through the primary inductor (the one connected to a
      power source),
      Ns is the number of turns in the secondary inductor, and
      Np is the number of turns in the primary inductor.
The power through one inductor is the same as the power through the other.
These equations neglect any forcing by current sources or voltage sources.
