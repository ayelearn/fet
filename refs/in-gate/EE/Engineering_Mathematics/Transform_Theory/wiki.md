****** Transform theory ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In mathematics, transform theory is the study of transforms, which relate a
function in one domain to another function in a second domain. The essence of
transform theory is that by a suitable choice of basis for a vector_space a
problem may be simplified—or diagonalized as in spectral_theory.
***** Spectral theory[edit] *****
In spectral_theory, the spectral_theorem says that if A is an nÃn self-adjoint
matrix, there is an orthonormal_basis of eigenvectors of A. This implies that A
is diagonalizable.
Furthermore, each eigenvalue is real.
