The superposition theorem for electrical_circuits states that for a linear
system the response (voltage or current) in any branch of a bilateral linear
circuit having more than one independent source equals the algebraic sum of the
responses caused by each independent source acting alone, where all the other
independent sources are replaced by their internal impedances.
To ascertain the contribution of each individual source, all of the other
sources first must be "turned off" (set to zero) by:
    * Replacing all other independent voltage_sources with a short_circuit
      (thereby eliminating difference of potential i.e. V=0; internal impedance
      of ideal voltage_source is zero (short_circuit)).
    * Replacing all other independent current_sources with an open_circuit
      (thereby eliminating current i.e. I=0; internal impedance of ideal
      current_source is infinite (open circuit)).
This procedure is followed for each source in turn, then the resultant
responses are added to determine the true operation of the circuit. The
resultant circuit operation is the superposition of the various voltage and
current sources.
The superposition theorem is very important in circuit analysis. It is used in
converting any circuit into its Norton_equivalent or Thevenin_equivalent.
The theorem is applicable to linear networks (time varying or time invariant)
consisting of independent sources, linear dependent_sources, linear passive
elements (resistors, inductors, capacitors) and linear transformers.
Superposition works for voltage and current but not power. In other words, the
sum of the powers of each source with the other sources turned off is not the
real consumed power. To calculate power we first use superposition to find both
current and voltage of each linear element and then calculate the sum of the
multiplied voltages and currents.
***** Gas pressure analogy[edit] *****
The electric circuit superposition theorem is analogous to Dalton's_law of
partial_pressure which can be stated as the total pressure exerted by an ideal
gas mixture in a given volume is the algebraic sum of all the pressures exerted
by each gas if it were alone in that volume.
