Power Systems is a family of server_computers from IBM that are based on its
POWER processors. Before the Power Systems line was announced on April 2, 2008,
[1] IBM had two distinct POWER processor-based lines: the System_i running IBM
i (formerly i5/OS and OS/400) – and the System_p series running AIX or Linux.

***** History[edit] *****
IBM had two distinct POWER- and PowerPC-based hardware lines since the early
1990s:
    * Servers running processors based on the IBM_PowerPC-AS architecture in
      the AS/400 family (later known as iSeries, then System_i), running OS/400
      (later known i5/OS, and now IBM_i)
    * Servers and workstations using IBM_POWER and PowerPC microprocessors in
      the RS/6000 family (later known as pSeries, then System_p), running IBM
      AIX and Linux.
They merged to use essentially the same hardware platform in 2001/2002 with the
introduction of the POWER4 processor. After that, there was little difference
between both the "p" and the "i" hardware; the only differences were in the
software and services offerings. With the introduction of the POWER5 processor
in 2004, even the product numbering was synchronized. The System i5 570 was
virtually identical to the System p5 570.
In April 2008, IBM officially merged the two lines of servers and workstations
under the same name, Power Systems, with identical hardware and a choice of
operating systems, software, and service contracts. In February 2010, IBM
announced new models with the new POWER7 microprocessor.
***** Systems[edit] *****
POWER8-based IBM Power Systems E870 can be configured with up to 80 processor
cores and 8 TB of memory.
