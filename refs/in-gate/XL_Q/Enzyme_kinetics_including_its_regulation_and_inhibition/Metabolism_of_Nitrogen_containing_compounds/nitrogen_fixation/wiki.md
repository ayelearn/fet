****** Nitrogen fixation ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The process in which nitrogen is taken from its relatively inert molecular form
(Nâ) in the atmosphere and converted into nitrogen compounds useful for other
chemical processes, such as ammonia, nitrate and nitrogen dioxide
Nitrogen fixation is a process by which nitrogen in the air is converted into
ammonia (NH3) or related nitrogenous compounds.[1] Atmospheric nitrogen is
molecular dinitrogen, a relatively nonreactive molecule that is metabolically
useless to all but a few microorganisms. Biological nitrogen fixation converts
N2 into ammonia, which is metabolized by most organisms.
Nitrogen fixation is essential to life because fixed inorganic nitrogen
compounds are required for the biosynthesis of all nitrogen-containing organic
compounds, such as amino_acids and proteins, nucleoside_triphosphates and
nucleic_acids. As part of the nitrogen_cycle, it is essential for agriculture
and the manufacture of fertilizer. It is also, indirectly, relevant to the
manufacture of all chemical compounds that contain nitrogen, which includes
explosives, most pharmaceuticals, and dyes.
Nitrogen fixation is carried out naturally in the soil by a wide range of
microorganisms termed diazotrophs that include bacteria such as Azotobacter,
and archaea. Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria have symbiotic relationships with
some plant groups, especially legumes.[2] Looser non-symbiotic relationships
between diazotrophs and plants are often referred to as associative, as seen in
nitrogen fixation on rice roots. Nitrogen fixation also occurs between some
termites and fungi.[3] It also occurs naturally in the air by means of NOx
production by lightning.[4][5]
All biological nitrogen fixation is effected by enzymes called nitrogenases.[6]
These enzymes contain iron, often with a second metal, usually molybdenum but
sometimes vanadium.

***** Non-biological natural nitrogen fixation[edit] *****
Lightning heats the air around it breaking the bonds of N2 starting the
formation of nitrous acid.
Nitrogen can be fixed by lightning converting nitrogen and oxygen into NO
x  (nitrogen_oxides). NO
x  may react with water to make nitrous_acid or nitric_acid, which seeps into
the soil, where it makes nitrate, which is of use to growing plants. Nitrogen
in the atmosphere is highly stable and nonreactive due to there being a triple
bond between atoms in the N2 molecule.[7] Lightning produces enough energy and
heat to break this bond[7] allowing the nitrogen atoms to react with oxygen
forming NOx. This itself cannot be used by plants, but as this molecule cools
it reacts with more oxygen to form NO2.[8] This molecule in turn reacts with
water to produce HNO3 (nitric_acid), or its ion NO3- (nitrate), which is usable
by plants.[9][7]
***** Biological nitrogen fixation[edit] *****
Schematic representation of the nitrogen_cycle. Abiotic nitrogen fixation has
been omitted.
Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered by the German agronomist Hermann
Hellriegel[10] and Dutch microbiologist Martinus_Beijerinck.[11] Biological
nitrogen fixation (BNF) occurs when atmospheric nitrogen is converted to
ammonia by an enzyme called a nitrogenase.[1] The overall reaction for BNF is:
N2 + 16ATP + 8e- + 8H+ -> 2NH3 + H2 + 16ADP + 16Pi
The process is coupled to the hydrolysis of 16 equivalents of ATP and is
accompanied by the co-formation of one equivalent of H2.[12] The conversion of
N2 into ammonia occurs at a metal_cluster called FeMoco, an abbreviation for
the iron-molybdenum cofactor. The mechanism proceeds via a series of
protonation and reduction steps wherein the FeMoco active_site hydrogenates the
N2 substrate.[13] In free-living diazotrophs, the nitrogenase-generated ammonia
is assimilated into glutamate through the glutamine_synthetase/glutamate
synthase pathway. The microbial nif_genes required for nitrogen fixation are
widely distributed in diverse environments.[14][15]
Nitrogenases are rapidly degraded by oxygen. For this reason, many bacteria
cease production of the enzyme in the presence of oxygen. Many nitrogen-fixing
organisms exist only in anaerobic conditions, respiring to draw down oxygen
levels, or binding the oxygen with a protein such as leghemoglobin.[1]
**** Microorganisms that fix nitrogen[edit] ****
Main article: Diazotroph
Diazotrophs are widespread within domain Bacteria including cyanobacteria (e.g.
the highly significant Trichodesmium and Cyanothece), as well as green_sulfur
bacteria, Azotobacteraceae, rhizobia and Frankia. Several obligately anaerobic
bacteria fix nitrogen including many (but not all) Clostridium spp. Some
Archaea also fix nitrogen, including several methanogenic taxa, which are
significant contributors to nitrogen fixation in oxygen-deficient soils.[16]
Cyanobacteria inhabit nearly all illuminated environments on Earth and play key
roles in the carbon and nitrogen_cycle of the biosphere. In general,
cyanobacteria can use various inorganic and organic sources of combined
nitrogen, like nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, or some amino_acids. Several
cyanobacterial strains are also capable of diazotrophic growth, an ability that
may have been present in their last common ancestor in the Archean eon.[17]
Nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria in coral_reefs can fix twice as much
nitrogen as on landâaround 1.8 kg of nitrogen is fixed per hectare per day
(around 660 kg/ha/year). The colonial marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium is
thought to fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the
nitrogen fixation in marine systems globally.[18]
Also marine surface licing and non-photosynthetic bacteria belonging in
Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes have shown to fixate huge amounts of
atmospheric nitrogen.[19]
**** Root nodule symbioses[edit] ****
Main article: Root_nodule
*** The legume family[edit] ***
Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include those of the legume
family – Fabaceae – with taxa such as kudzu, clovers, soybeans, alfalfa,
lupines, peanuts, and rooibos. They contain symbiotic bacteria called rhizobia
within nodules in their root_systems, producing nitrogen compounds that help
the plant to grow and compete with other plants.[20] When the plant dies, the
fixed nitrogen is released, making it available to other plants; this helps to
fertilize the soil.[1][21] The great majority of legumes have this association,
but a few genera (e.g., Styphnolobium) do not. In many traditional and organic
farming practices, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which
usually include one consisting mainly or entirely of clover or buckwheat (non-
legume family Polygonaceae), often referred to as "green_manure".[22]
The efficiency of nitrogen fixation in soil is dependent on many factors,
including the legume as well as air and soil conditions. For example, nitrogen
fixation by red clover can range from 50 - 200 lb./acre depending on these
variables.[23]
Inga_alley_farming relies on the leguminous genus Inga, a small tropical,
tough-leaved, nitrogen-fixing tree.[24]
**** Non-leguminous[edit] ****
A sectioned alder tree root nodule
Although by far the majority of plant species able to form nitrogen-fixing root
nodules are in the legume family Fabaceae, there are exceptions:
    * Parasponia, a tropical genus in the Cannabaceae also able to interact
      with rhizobia and form nitrogen-fixing nodules[25]
    * Actinorhizal_plants such as alder and bayberry can also form nitrogen-
      fixing nodules, thanks to a symbiotic association with Frankia bacteria.
      These plants belong to 25 genera[26] distributed among 8 plant families.
The ability to fix nitrogen is present in the families listed below. They
belong to the orders Cucurbitales, Fagales, and Rosales, which together with
the Fabales form a clade of eurosids. The ability to fix nitrogen is not
universally present in these families. For example, of 122 genera in the
Rosaceae, only 4 genera are capable of fixing nitrogen. Fabales were the first
lineage to branch off this nitrogen-fixing clade; thus, the ability to fix
nitrogen may be plesiomorphic and subsequently lost in most descendants of the
original nitrogen-fixing plant; however, it may be that the basic genetic and
physiological requirements were present in an incipient state in the most
recent_common_ancestors of all these plants, but only evolved to full function
in some of them.

    * Gunnera
    * Blasia (liverwort)
    * Hornworts[27]
**** Endosymbiosis in diatoms[edit] ****
Rhopalodia_gibba, a diatom alga, is a eukaryote with cyanobacterial N2-fixing
endosymbiont organelles. The spheroid bodies reside in the cytoplasm of the
diatoms and are inseparable from their hosts.[28][29]
***** Industrial nitrogen fixation[edit] *****
The possibility that atmospheric nitrogen reacts with certain chemicals was
first observed by Desfosses in 1828. He observed that mixtures of alkali_metal
oxides and carbon react at high temperatures with nitrogen. With the use of
barium_carbonate as starting material the first commercially used process
became available in the 1860s developed by Margueritte and Sourdeval. The
resulting barium_cyanide could be reacted with steam yielding ammonia.
Main article: FrankâCaro_process
In 1898 Adolph_Frank and Nikodem_Caro decoupled the process and first produced
calcium_carbide and in a subsequent step reacted it with nitrogen to calcium
cyanamide. The Ostwald_process for the production of nitric_acid was discovered
in 1902. Frank-Caro_process and Ostwald process dominated the industrial
fixation of nitrogen until the discovery of the Haber_process in 1909.[30][31]
Prior to 1900, Nikola_Tesla also experimented with the industrial fixation of
nitrogen "by using currents of extremely high frequency or rate of vibration".
[32][33]
**** Haber process[edit] ****
Main article: Haber_process
Equipment for a study of nitrogen fixation by alpha_rays (Fixed Nitrogen
Research Laboratory, 1926)
Artificial fertilizer production is now the largest source of human-produced
fixed nitrogen in the Earth's ecosystem. Ammonia is a required precursor to
fertilizers, explosives, and other products. The most common method is the
Haber_process. The Haber process requires high pressures (around 200 atm) and
high temperatures (at least 400 Â°C), routine conditions for industrial
catalysis. This highly efficient process uses natural gas as a hydrogen source
and air as a nitrogen source.[34]
Much research has been conducted on the discovery of catalysts for nitrogen
fixation, often with the goal of reducing the energy required for this
conversion. However, such research has thus far failed to even approach the
efficiency and ease of the Haber process. Many compounds react with atmospheric
nitrogen to give dinitrogen_complexes. The first dinitrogen complex to be
reported was Ru(NH3)5(N2)2+.[35]
**** Ambient nitrogen reduction[edit] ****
Catalytic chemical nitrogen fixation at ambient conditions is an ongoing
scientific endeavor. Guided by the example of nitrogenase, this area of
homogeneous catalysis is ongoing, with particular emphasis on hydrogenation to
give ammonia.[36]
Metallic lithium has long been known for burning in an atmosphere of nitrogen
and then converting to lithium_nitride. Hydrolysis of the resulting nitride
gives ammonia. In a related process, trimethylsilyl_chloride, lithium, and
nitrogen react in the presence of a catalyst to give tris(trimethylsilyl)amine.
Tris(trimethylsilyl)amine can then be used for reaction with Î±,Î´,Ï-
triketones to give tricyclic pyrroles.[37] Processes involving lithium metal
are however of no practical interest since they are non-catalytic and re-
reducing the Li+ ion residue is difficult.
Beginning in the 1960s several homogeneous systems were identified that convert
nitrogen to ammonia, sometimes even catalytically but often operating via ill-
defined mechanisms. The original discovery is described in an early review:
     "Vol'pin and co-workers, using a non-protic Lewis acid, aluminium
     tribromide, were able to demonstrate the truly catalytic effect of
     titanium by treating dinitrogen with a mixture of titanium
     tetrachloride, metallic aluminium, and aluminium tribromide at
     50 Â°C, either in the absence or in the presence of a solvent, e.g.
     benzene. As much as 200 mol of ammonia per mol of TiCl4 was obtained
     after hydrolysis.â¦"[38]
Synthetic nitrogen reduction[39]
The quest for well defined intermediates led to the characterization of many
transition_metal_dinitrogen_complexes. Few of these well-defined complexes
function catalytically, their behavior illuminated likely stages in nitrogen
fixation. Fruitful early studies focused on M(N2)2(dppe)2 (M = Mo, W), which
protonates to give intermediates with ligand M=NâNH2. In 1995, a molybdenum
(III) amido complex was discovered that cleaved N2 to give the corresponding
molybdenum(VI) nitride.[40] This and related terminal nitrido complexes have
been used to make nitriles.[41]
In 2003 a molybdenum amido complex was found to catalyze the reduction of N2,
albeit with few turnovers.[39][42][43][44] In these systems, like the
biological one, hydrogen is provided to the substrate heterolytically, by means
of protons and a strong reducing_agent rather than with H2 itself.
In 2011, yet another molybdenum-based system was discovered, but with a
diphosphorus pincer_ligand.[45] Photolytic nitrogen splitting is also
considered.[46][47][48][49][50]
Braunschweig's 2018 dinitrogen activation with a transient borylene species
Nitrogen fixation at a p-block element was published in 2018 whereby one
molecule of dinitrogen is bound by two transient Lewis-base-stabilized borylene
species.[51] The resulting dianion was subsequently oxidized to a neutral
compound, and reduced using water.
**** Photochemical and Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction[edit] ****
With the help of catalysis and energy provided by electricity and light, NH3
can be produced directly from nitrogen and water at ambient temperature and
pressure.

  44. ^ The catalyst is derived from molybdenum(V)_chloride and tris(2-
      aminoethyl)amine N-substituted with three very bulky hexa-
      isopropylterphenyl (HIPT) groups. Nitrogen adds end-on to the molybdenum
      atom, and the bulky HIPT substituents prevent the formation of the stable
      and nonreactive MoâN=NâMo dimer. In this isolated pocket is the
      MoâN2. The proton donor is a pyridinium salt of weakly coordinating
      counter anion. The reducing_agent is decamethylchromocene. All ammonia
      formed is collected as the HCl salt by trapping the distillate with a HCl
      solution.
  45. ^ Note also that, although the dinitrogen complex is shown in brackets,
      this species can be isolated and characterized. Here the brackets do not
      indicate that the intermediate is not observed.
