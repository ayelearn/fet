Biochemistry, sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of chemical
processes within and relating to living organisms.[1] Biochemical processes
give rise to the complexity of life.
A sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry, biochemistry can be divided in
three fields; molecular_genetics, protein_science and metabolism. Over the last
decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has through these three disciplines
become successful at explaining living processes. Almost all areas_of_the_life
sciences are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and
research.[2] Biochemistry focuses on understanding how biological_molecules
give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells,[3]
which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues,
organs, and organism structure and function.[4]
Biochemistry is closely related to molecular_biology, the study of the
molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena.[5]
Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of
biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic_acids, carbohydrates and
lipids, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions
associated with life.[6] The chemistry of the cell also depends on the
reactions of smaller molecules and ions. These can be inorganic, for example
water and metal ions, or organic, for example the amino_acids, which are used
to synthesize_proteins.[7] The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from
their environment via chemical_reactions are known as metabolism. The findings
of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine, nutrition, and agriculture.
In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of diseases.[8] In
nutrition, they study how to maintain health wellness and study the effects of
nutritional_deficiencies.[9] In agriculture, biochemists investigate soil and
fertilizers, and try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation, crop storage
and pest_control.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_biochemistry
Gerty_Cori and Carl_Cori jointly won the Nobel_Prize in 1947 for their
discovery of the Cori_cycle at RPMI.
At its broadest definition, biochemistry can be seen as a study of the
components and composition of living things and how they come together to
become life, in this sense the history of biochemistry may therefore go back as
far as the ancient_Greeks.[10] However, biochemistry as a specific scientific
discipline has its beginning sometime in the 19th_century, or a little earlier,
depending on which aspect of biochemistry is being focused on. Some argued that
the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme,
diastase (today called amylase), in 1833 by Anselme_Payen,[11] while others
considered Eduard_Buchner's first demonstration of a complex biochemical
process alcoholic_fermentation in cell-free extracts in 1897 to be the birth of
biochemistry.[12][13] Some might also point as its beginning to the influential
1842 work by Justus_von_Liebig, Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its
applications to physiology and pathology, which presented a chemical theory of
metabolism,[10] or even earlier to the 18th century studies on fermentation and
respiration by Antoine_Lavoisier.[14][15] Many other pioneers in the field who
helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed
founders of modern biochemistry, for example Emil_Fischer for his work on the
chemistry of proteins,[16] and F._Gowland_Hopkins on enzymes and the dynamic
nature of biochemistry.[17]
The term "biochemistry" itself is derived from a combination of biology and
chemistry. In 1877, Felix_Hoppe-Seyler used the term (biochemie in German) as a
synonym for physiological_chemistry in the foreword to the first issue of
Zeitschrift_fÃ¼r_Physiologische_Chemie (Journal of Physiological Chemistry)
where he argued for the setting up of institutes dedicated to this field of
study.[18][19] The German chemist Carl_Neuberg however is often cited to have
coined the word in 1903,[20][21][22] while some credited it to Franz
Hofmeister.[23]
DNA structure (1D65​)[24]
It was once generally believed that life and its materials had some essential
property or substance (often referred to as the "vital_principle") distinct
from any found in non-living matter, and it was thought that only living beings
could produce the molecules of life.[25] Then, in 1828, Friedrich_WÃ¶hler
published a paper on the_synthesis of urea, proving that organic compounds can
be created artificially.[26] Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially
since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as
chromatography, X-ray_diffraction, dual_polarisation_interferometry, NMR
spectroscopy, radioisotopic_labeling, electron_microscopy, and molecular
dynamics simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed
analysis of many molecules and metabolic_pathways of the cell, such as
glycolysis and the Krebs_cycle (citric acid cycle), and led to an understanding
of biochemistry on a molecular level. Philip_Randle is well known for his
discovery in diabetes research is possibly the glucose-fatty acid cycle in
1963. He confirmed that fatty acids reduce oxidation of sugar by the muscle.
High fat oxidation was responsible for the insulin resistance.[27]
Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the
gene, and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. This part of
biochemistry is often called molecular_biology of the gene.[28] In the 1950s,
James_D._Watson, Francis_Crick, Rosalind_Franklin, and Maurice_Wilkins were
instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with
genetic transfer of information.[29] In 1958, George_Beadle and Edward_Tatum
received the Nobel_Prize for work in fungi showing that one_gene_produces_one
enzyme.[30] In 1988, Colin_Pitchfork was the first person convicted of murder
with DNA evidence, which led to the growth of forensic_science.[31] More
recently, Andrew_Z._Fire and Craig_C._Mello received the 2006_Nobel_Prize for
discovering the role of RNA_interference (RNAi), in the silencing of gene
expression.[32]
***** Starting materials: the chemical elements of life[edit] *****
The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant (by
mass) to least abundant.
Main articles: Composition_of_the_human_body and Dietary_mineral
Around two dozen of the 92 naturally occurring chemical_elements are essential
to various kinds of biological_life. Most rare_elements_on_Earth are not needed
by life (exceptions being selenium and iodine), while a few common ones
(aluminum and titanium) are not used. Most organisms share element needs, but
there are a few differences between plants and animals. For example, ocean
algae use bromine, but land plants and animals seem to need none. All animals
require sodium, but some plants do not. Plants need boron and silicon, but
animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).
Just six elementsâcarbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and
phosphorusâmake up almost 99% of the mass of living cells, including those in
the human body (see composition_of_the_human_body for a complete list). In
addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body, humans
require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more.[33]
***** Biomolecules[edit] *****
Main article: Biomolecule
The four main classes of molecules in biochemistry (often called biomolecules)
are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic_acids.[34] Many biological
molecules are polymers: in this terminology, monomers are relatively small
micromolecules that are linked together to create large macromolecules known as
polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a biological_polymer,
they undergo a process called dehydration_synthesis. Different macromolecules
can assemble in larger complexes, often needed for biological_activity.
**** Carbohydrates[edit] ****
Main articles: Carbohydrate, Monosaccharide, Disaccharide, and Polysaccharide
Carbohydrates
Glucose, a monosaccharide
A molecule of sucrose (glucose + fructose), a disaccharide
Amylose, a polysaccharide made up of several thousand glucose units
Two of the main functions of carbohydrates are energy storage and providing
structure. Sugars are carbohydrates, but not all carbohydrates are sugars.
There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule;
they are used to store energy and genetic_information, as well as play
important roles in cell to cell_interactions and communications.
The simplest type of carbohydrate is a monosaccharide, which among other
properties contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1
(generalized formula CnH2nOn, where n is at least 3). Glucose (C6H12O6) is one
of the most important carbohydrates; others include fructose (C6H12O6), the
sugar commonly associated with the sweet_taste of fruits,[35][a] and
deoxyribose (C5H10O4), a component of DNA. A monosaccharide can switch between
acyclic_(open-chain)_form and a cyclic form. The open-chain form can be turned
into a ring of carbon atoms bridged by an oxygen atom created from the carbonyl
group of one end and the hydroxyl group of another. The cyclic molecule has a
hemiacetal or hemiketal group, depending on whether the linear form was an
aldose or a ketose.[36]
Conversion between the furanose, acyclic, and pyranose forms of D-glucose
In these cyclic forms, the ring usually has 5 or 6 atoms. These forms are
called furanoses and pyranoses, respectivelyâby analogy with furan and pyran,
the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the
carbon-carbon double_bonds of these two molecules). For example, the aldohexose
glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the
oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called
glucofuranose. The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form
a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called glucopyranose. Cyclic forms with a 7-
atom ring called heptoses are rare.
Two monosaccharides can be joined together by a glycosidic or ether_bond into a
disaccharide through a dehydration_reaction during which a molecule of water is
released. The reverse reaction in which the glycosidic bond of a disaccharide
is broken into two monosaccharides is termed hydrolysis. The best-known
disaccharide is sucrose or ordinary sugar, which consists of a glucose molecule
and a fructose molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is
lactose found in milk, consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose
molecule. Lactose may be hydrolysed by lactase, and deficiency in this enzyme
results in lactose_intolerance.
When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined, it is called an
oligosaccharide (oligo- meaning "few"). These molecules tend to be used as
markers and signals, as well as having some other uses.[37] Many
monosaccharides joined together make a polysaccharide. They can be joined
together in one long linear chain, or they may be branched. Two of the most
common polysaccharides are cellulose and glycogen, both consisting of repeating
glucose monomers. Cellulose is an important structural component of plant's
cell_walls and glycogen is used as a form of energy storage in animals.
Sugar can be characterized by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing
end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the
open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers
takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or
furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a
full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form
and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end
at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with
the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose does not have a reducing end because of
full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto
carbon of fructose (C2).
**** Lipids[edit] ****
Main articles: Lipid, Glycerol, and Fatty_acid
Structures of some common lipids. At the top are cholesterol and oleic_acid.
[38] The middle structure is a triglyceride composed of oleoyl, stearoyl, and
palmitoyl chains attached to a glycerol backbone. At the bottom is the common
phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine.[39]
Lipids comprises a diverse range of molecules and to some extent is a catchall
for relatively water-insoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin,
including waxes, fatty_acids, fatty-acid derived phospholipids, sphingolipids,
glycolipids, and terpenoids (e.g., retinoids and steroids). Some lipids are
linear, open chain aliphatic molecules, while others have ring structures. Some
are aromatic (with a cyclic [ring] and planar [flat] structure) while others
are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.[40]
Lipids are usually made from one molecule of glycerol combined with other
molecules. In triglycerides, the main group of bulk lipids, there is one
molecule of glycerol and three fatty_acids. Fatty acids are considered the
monomer in that case, and may be saturated (no double_bonds in the carbon
chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds in the carbon chain).[41]
Most lipids have some polar character in addition to being largely nonpolar. In
general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or hydrophobic ("water-
fearing"), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like
water. Another part of their structure is polar or hydrophilic ("water-loving")
and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them
amphiphilic molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In
the case of cholesterol, the polar group is a mere âOH (hydroxyl or alcohol).
In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more
polar, as described below.[42]
Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most oils and milk_products that
we use for cooking and eating like butter, cheese, ghee etc., are composed of
fats. Vegetable_oils are rich in various polyunsaturated_fatty_acids (PUFA).
Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into
fatty acids and glycerol, which are the final degradation products of fats and
lipids. Lipids, especially phospholipids, are also used in various
pharmaceutical_products, either as co-solubilisers (e.g., in parenteral
infusions) or else as drug_carrier components (e.g., in a liposome or
transfersome).
**** Proteins[edit] ****
Main articles: Protein and Amino_acid
The general structure of an Î±-amino acid, with the amino group on the left and
the carboxyl group on the right.
Proteins are very large moleculesâmacro-biopolymersâmade from monomers
called amino_acids. An amino acid consists of a carbon atom attached to an
amino group, âNH2, a carboxylic_acid group, âCOOH (although these exist as
âNH3+ and âCOOâ under physiologic conditions), a simple hydrogen atom,
and a side chain commonly denoted as "âR". The side chain "R" is different
for each amino acid of which there are 20 standard_ones. It is this "R" group
that made each amino acid different, and the properties of the side-chains
greatly influence the overall three-dimensional_conformation of a protein. Some
amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance,
glutamate functions as an important neurotransmitter. Amino acids can be joined
via a peptide_bond. In this dehydration synthesis, a water molecule is removed
and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to
the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is
called a dipeptide, and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than
thirty) are called peptides or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title
proteins. As an example, the important blood serum protein albumin contains 585
amino acid residues.[43]
Generic amino acids (1) in neutral form, (2) as they exist physiologically, and
(3) joined together as a dipeptide.
A schematic of hemoglobin. The red and blue ribbons represent the protein
globin; the green structures are the heme groups.
Proteins can have structural and/or functional roles. For instance, movements
of the proteins actin and myosin ultimately are responsible for the contraction
of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically
bind to a certain molecule or class of moleculesâthey may be extremely
selective in what they bind. Antibodies are an example of proteins that attach
to one specific type of molecule. Antibodies are composed of heavy and light
chains. Two heavy chains would be linked to two light chains through disulfide
linkages between their amino acids. Antibodies are specific through variation
based on differences in the N-terminal domain.[44]
In fact, the enzyme-linked_immunosorbent_assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies,
is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various
biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the enzymes.
Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the
activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant
molecules called substrates; they then catalyze the reaction between them. By
lowering the activation_energy, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of
1011 or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete
spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself
is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a
new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can
be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.
[citation_needed]
The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four
levels. The primary_structure of a protein consists of its linear sequence of
amino acids; for instance, "alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-
asparagine-glycine-lysine-â¦". Secondary_structure is concerned with local
morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of
amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an Î±-helix or into a sheet
called a Î²-sheet; some Î±-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic
above. Tertiary_structure is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein.
This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single
change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains
146 amino acid residues; substitution of the glutamate residue at position 6
with a valine residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it
results in sickle-cell_disease. Finally, quaternary_structure is concerned with
the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with
its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.[45]

domains
Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides
in the small_intestine, and then absorbed. They can then be joined to make new
proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the
pentose_phosphate_pathway can be used to make all twenty amino acids, and most
bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them.
Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They
cannot synthesize isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine,
threonine, tryptophan, and valine. These are the essential_amino_acids, since
it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize
alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine,
proline, serine, and tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids. While they can
synthesize arginine and histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts
for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino
acids.
If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon
skeleton called an Î±-keto_acid. Enzymes called transaminases can easily
transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an Î±-keto acid) to
another Î±-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the
biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from
other biochemical pathways are converted to the Î±-keto acid skeleton, and then
an amino group is added, often via transamination. The amino acids may then be
linked together to make a protein.[46]
A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into
its component amino acids. Free ammonia (NH3), existing as the ammonium ion
(NH4+) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it
must therefore exist. Different tactics have evolved in different animals,
depending on the animals' needs. Unicellular organisms simply release the
ammonia into the environment. Likewise, bony_fish can release the ammonia into
the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert the ammonia
into urea, via the urea_cycle.[47]
In order to determine whether two proteins are related, or in other words to
decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison
methods. Methods like sequence_alignments and structural_alignments are
powerful tools that help scientists identify homologies between related
molecules.[48] The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond
forming an evolutionary pattern of protein_families. By finding how similar two
protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore
their function.
**** Nucleic acids[edit] ****
Main articles: Nucleic_acid, DNA, RNA, and Nucleotide
The structure of deoxyribonucleic_acid (DNA), the picture shows the monomers
being put together.
Nucleic_acids, so called because of their prevalence in cellular nuclei, is the
generic name of the family of biopolymers. They are complex, high-molecular-
weight biochemical macromolecules that can convey genetic_information in all
living cells and viruses.[2] The monomers are called nucleotides, and each
consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic base (either a purine
or a pyrimidine), a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group.[49]
Structural elements of common nucleic acid constituents. Because they contain
at least one phosphate group, the compounds marked nucleoside monophosphate,
nucleoside diphosphate and nucleoside triphosphate are all nucleotides (not
simply phosphate-lacking nucleosides).
The most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic_acid (DNA) and ribonucleic
acid (RNA).[50] The phosphate_group and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with
each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid, while the sequence of
nitrogenous bases stores the information. The most common nitrogenous bases are
adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. The nitrogenous_bases of each
strand of a nucleic acid will form hydrogen_bonds with certain other
nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid (similar to a
zipper). Adenine binds with thymine and uracil; thymine binds only with
adenine; and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another.
Aside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as
second_messengers, as well as forming the base molecule for adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living
organisms.[51] Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids
are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while
thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA.
***** Metabolism[edit] *****
**** Carbohydrates as energy source[edit] ****
Main article: Carbohydrate_metabolism
Glucose is an energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides
are broken down into their monomers by enzymes (glycogen_phosphorylase removes
glucose residues from glycogen, a polysaccharide). Disaccharides like lactose
or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.
*** Glycolysis (anaerobic)[edit] ***

Glycolysis
[The image above contains clickable links]
The metabolic_pathway of glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate by via a
series of intermediate metabolites. Each chemical modification (red box) is
performed by a different enzyme. Steps 1 and 3 consume ATP (blue) and steps 7
and 10 produce ATP (yellow). Since steps 6-10 occur twice per glucose molecule,
this leads to a net production of ATP.
Glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important ten-step pathway called
glycolysis, the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose
into two molecules of pyruvate. This also produces a net two molecules of ATP,
the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting
NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen
is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting
the pyruvate to lactate_(lactic_acid) (e.g., in humans) or to ethanol plus
carbon dioxide (e.g., in yeast). Other monosaccharides like galactose and
fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.[52]
*** Aerobic[edit] ***
In aerobic cells with sufficient oxygen, as in most human cells, the pyruvate
is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to acetyl-CoA, giving off
one carbon atom as the waste product carbon_dioxide, generating another
reducing equivalent as NADH. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of
glucose) then enter the citric_acid_cycle, producing two molecules of ATP, six
more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via FADH2 as enzyme-bound
cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The
produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the
respiratory chain, an electron_transport_system transferring the electrons
ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton
gradient over a membrane (inner_mitochondrial_membrane in eukaryotes). Thus,
oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD+ and quinone
are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon
dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy
states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted
to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional 28 molecules of ATP (24
from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP
conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate
cycle).[53] It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose
provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic
feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only
after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.
*** Gluconeogenesis[edit] ***
Main article: Gluconeogenesis
In vertebrates, vigorously contracting skeletal_muscles (during weightlifting
or sprinting, for example) do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy
demand, and so they shift to anaerobic_metabolism, converting glucose to
lactate. The liver regenerates the glucose, using a process called
gluconeogenesis. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and
actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six
molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous
to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in
tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or starch in plants), or be
converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The
combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the
bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose
into the bloodstream is called the Cori_cycle.[54]
***** Relationship to other "molecular-scale" biological sciences[edit] *****
Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics, and molecular_biology.
Researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but
increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of
genetics, molecular_biology and biophysics. There is not a defined line between
these disciplines. Biochemistry studies the chemistry required for biological
activity of molecules, molecular_biology studies their biological activity,
genetics studies their heredity, which happens to be carried by their
genome.This is shown in the following schematic that depicts one possible view
of the relationships between the fields:[55]
    * Biochemistry is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes
      occurring in live organisms. Biochemists focus heavily on the chemistry
      behind the role, function, and structure of biomolecules. The study of
      the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of
      biologically active molecules are examples of biochemistry.[56].
      Biochemistry studies the chemistry which gives rise to the biology of
      molecules studied by molecular_biology.
    * Genetics is the study of the effect of genetic differences in organisms.
      This can often be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g. one
      gene). The study of "mutants" â organisms which lack one or more
      functional components with respect to the so-called "wild_type" or normal
      phenotype. Genetic interactions (epistasis) can often confound simple
      interpretations of such "knockout" studies.[57]. Genetics studies the
      heredity to daughter cell or organism of the biology of macromolecules
      which is studied by molecular biology.
    * Molecular biology is the study of molecular underpinnings of biological
      activity. It studies the structure, function, processing, regulation,
      interactions and evolution of biomolecules. Its most famous subfield,
      molecular_genetics, studies the processes of replication, transcription,
      translation, and genetic mechanisms of cell function . The central_dogma
      of_molecular_biology where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and
      then translated into protein, despite being oversimplified, still
      provides a good starting point for understanding the field. The picture
      has been revised in light of emerging novel roles for RNA.[58]
    * 'Chemical_biology' seeks to develop new tools based on small_molecules
      that allow minimal perturbation of biological systems while providing
      detailed information about their function. Further, chemical biology
      employs biological systems to create non-natural hybrids between
      biomolecules and synthetic devices (for example emptied viral_capsids
      that can deliver gene_therapy or drug_molecules).[59]

***** Notes[edit] *****
a. ^ Fructose is not the only sugar found in fruits. Glucose and sucrose are
also found in varying quantities in various fruits, and sometimes exceed the
fructose present. For example, 32% of the edible portion of a date is glucose,
compared with 24% fructose and 8% sucrose. However, peaches contain more
sucrose (6.66%) than they do fructose (0.93%) or glucose (1.47%).[60]
