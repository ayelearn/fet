The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological
structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To
function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known
as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic_worms, and distinguish them from the
organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, there are two major subsystems
of the immune system: the innate_immune_system and the adaptive_immune_system.
Both subsystems use humoral_immunity and cell-mediated_immunity to perform
their functions. In humans, the bloodâbrain_barrier, bloodâcerebrospinal
fluid_barrier, and similar fluidâbrain barriers separate the peripheral
immune system from the neuroimmune_system, which protects the brain.
Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and
neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have
also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular
organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of
enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune
mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern
descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include
phagocytosis, antimicrobial_peptides called defensins, and the complement
system. Jawed_vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated
defense mechanisms,[1] including the ability to adapt over time to recognize
specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates
immunological_memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading
to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This
process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.
Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune_diseases, inflammatory
diseases and cancer.[2] Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less
active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In
humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic_disease such as
severe_combined_immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the
use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a
hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign
organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's_thyroiditis,
rheumatoid_arthritis, diabetes_mellitus_type_1, and systemic_lupus
erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system.

***** Layered defense[edit] *****
The immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of
increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens
such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches
these barriers, the innate_immune_system provides an immediate, but non-
specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals.
[3] If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a
second layer of protection, the adaptive_immune_system, which is activated by
the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an
infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is
then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an
immunological_memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and
stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.[4][5]

Both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to
distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules
are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from
foreign substances by the immune system.[6] Conversely, non-self molecules are
those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are
called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances
that bind to specific immune_receptors and elicit an immune response.[7]
Newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly
vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by
the mother. During pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is
transported from mother to baby directly through the placenta, so human babies
have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen
specificities as their mother.[8] Breast_milk or colostrum also contains
antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against
bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.[9]
This is passive_immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory
cells or antibodiesâit only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually
short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine,
protective passive immunity can also be transferred_artificially from one
individual to another via antibody-rich serum.[10]
***** Innate immune system[edit] *****
Further information: Innate_immune_system
Microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the
cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system. The innate response is
usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern_recognition
receptors, which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of
microorganisms,[11] or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out alarm
signals, many of which (but not all) are recognized by the same receptors as
those that recognize pathogens.[12] Innate immune defenses are non-specific,
meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way.[7] This system
does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen. The innate immune
system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms.[3]
**** Pattern recognition by cells[edit] ****
Cells in the innate immune system use pattern_recognition_receptors (PRRs) to
recognize molecular structures that are produced by microbial pathogens. PRRs
are germline-encoded host sensors, which detect molecules typical for the
pathogens.[13] They are proteins expressed, mainly, by cells of the innate
immune_system, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and
epithelial cells,[14][15] to identify two classes of molecules: pathogen-
associated_molecular_patterns (PAMPs), which are associated with microbial
pathogens, and damage-associated_molecular_patterns (DAMPs), which are
associated with components of host's cells that are released during cell damage
or death.
*** Toll-like receptors[edit] ***
Recognition of extracellular or endosomal pathogen-associated molecular
patterns is mediated by transmembrane proteins known as toll-like_receptors
(TLRs).[16] TLRs share a typical structural motif, the Leucine_rich_repeats_
(LRR), which give them their specific appearance and are also responsible for
TLR functionality.[17] Toll-like receptors were first discovered in Drosophila
and trigger the synthesis and secretion of cytokines and activation of other
host defense programs that are necessary for both innate or adaptive immune
responses. To date, ten functional members of the TLR family have been
described in humans.[18]
*** Cytosolic receptors[edit] ***
Cells in the innate immune system have pattern recognition receptors that
detect infection or cell damage in the cytosol. Three major classes of these
cytosolic receptors are NODâlike_receptors, RIG_(retinoic_acid-inducible
gene)-like_receptors, and cytosolic DNA sensors.[19]
*** Inflammasomes[edit] ***
Main article: Inflammasome
Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes (consist of an NLR, the adaptor
protein ASC, and the effector molecule pro-caspase-1) that form in response to
cytosolic PAMPs and DAMPs, whose function is to generate active forms of the
inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18.[20]
**** Surface barriers[edit] ****
Several barriers protect organisms from infection, including mechanical,
chemical, and biological barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the
exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs,
and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense
against infection.[7] However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from
their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the
lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary_tract. In the lungs, coughing and
sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory
tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels
pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal_tract
serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.[21]
Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory
tract secrete antimicrobial_peptides such as the Î²-defensins.[22] Enzymes such
as lysozyme and phospholipase_A2 in saliva, tears, and breast_milk are also
antibacterials.[23][24] Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier
following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains
defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.[25][26] In the stomach, gastric_acid
serves as a powerful chemical defense against ingested pathogens.[27]
Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, commensal flora serve as
biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space
and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as pH
or available iron.[28] As a result of the symbiotic_relationship_between
commensals_and_the_immune_system, the probability that pathogens will reach
sufficient numbers to cause illness is reduced. However, since most antibiotics
non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can
lead to an "overgrowth" of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal
candidiasis (a yeast infection).[29] There is good evidence that re-
introduction of probiotic flora, such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli
normally found in unpasteurized yogurt, helps restore a healthy balance of
microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging
preliminary data in studies on bacterial_gastroenteritis, inflammatory_bowel
diseases, urinary_tract_infection and post-surgical_infections.[30][31][32]
**** Cellular components[edit] ****
A scanning_electron_microscope image of normal circulating human blood. One can
see red_blood_cells, several knobby white blood cells including lymphocytes, a
monocyte, a neutrophil, and many small disc-shaped platelets.
Leukocytes (white blood cells) act like independent, single-celled organisms
and are the second arm of the innate immune system.[7] The innate leukocytes
include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic_cells), innate
lymphoid_cells, mast_cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural_killer_cells.
These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger
pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms.[33]
Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the
activation of the adaptive immune system.[34]
Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by
cells called phagocytes that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes
generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to
specific locations by cytokines.[7] Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a
phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome,
which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a
phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or
following a respiratory_burst that releases free_radicals into the
phagolysosome.[35][36] Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients,
but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as
a defense mechanism.[37] Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of
host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and
invertebrate animals.[38]
*** Phagocytes[edit] ***
Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in
pursuit of invading pathogens.[39] Neutrophils are normally found in the
bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing
50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes,[40] and consisting of
neutrophil-killer and neutrophil-cager subpopulations. During the acute phase
of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, neutrophils
migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are
usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are
versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of
chemicals including enzymes, complement_proteins, and cytokines, while they can
also act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris,
and as antigen-presenting_cells that activate the adaptive immune system.[41]
*** Dendritic cells[edit] ***
Dendritic_cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the
external environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose,
lungs, stomach, and intestines.[42] They are named for their resemblance to
neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic
cells are in no way connected to the nervous_system. Dendritic cells serve as a
link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as
they present_antigens to T_cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive
immune system.[42]
*** Granulocytes[edit] ***
Further information: Granulocyte
Granulocytes are leukocytes that have granules in their cytoplasm. In this
category are neutrophils, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. Mast_cells
reside in connective_tissues and mucous_membranes, and regulate the
inflammatory response.[43] They are most often associated with allergy and
anaphylaxis.[40] Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They
secrete chemical mediators that are involved in defending against parasites and
play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma.[44]
*** Innate lymphoid cells[edit] ***
Innate_lymphoid_cells (ILCs) are a group of innate_immune cells that are
derived from common_lymphoid_progenitor (CLP) and belong to the lymphoid
lineage. These cells are defined by absence of antigen specific B or T_cell
receptor because of the lack of recombination_activating_gene (RAG). ILCs do
not express myeloid or dendritic cell markers.[45]
Natural_killer_cells, one of member ILCs, are lymphocytes and a component of
the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes.[46]
Rather, NK cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-
infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as "missing self."
This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I
(major_histocompatibility_complex)âa situation that can arise in viral
infections of host cells.[33] They were named "natural killer" because of the
initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that
are "missing self." For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor
cells and infected cells. It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of
those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of
"missing self". Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells
because they express intact self MHC antigens. Those MHC antigens are
recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) which essentially put
the brakes on NK cells.[47]
**** Inflammation[edit] ****
Further information: Inflammation
Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection.
[48] The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which
are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by
eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells.
Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood
vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain
white_blood_cells (leukocytes).[49][50] Common cytokines include interleukins
that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines
that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as
shutting down protein_synthesis in the host cell.[51] Growth_factors and
cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals
recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any
damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.[52]
**** Complement system[edit] ****
Further information: Complement_system
The complement system is a biochemical_cascade that attacks the surfaces of
foreign cells. It contains over 20 different proteins and is named for its
ability to "complement" the killing of pathogens by antibodies. Complement is
the major humoral component of the innate immune response.[53][54] Many species
have complement systems, including non-mammals like plants, fish, and some
invertebrates.[33]
In humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that
have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to
carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes. This recognition signal triggers a
rapid killing response.[55] The speed of the response is a result of signal
amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement
molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind
to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates
other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that
amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive_feedback.[56] The cascade
results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase
vascular_permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking
it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly
by disrupting their plasma_membrane.[53]
***** Adaptive immune system[edit] *****
Further information: Adaptive_immune_system
The adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a
stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen
is "remembered" by a signature antigen.[57] The adaptive immune response is
antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific "non-self" antigens
during a process called antigen presentation. Antigen specificity allows for
the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or
pathogen-infected cells. The ability to mount these tailored responses is
maintained in the body by "memory cells". Should a pathogen infect the body
more than once, these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it.
**** The recognition of antigen[edit] ****
The cells of the adaptive immune system are special types of leukocytes, called
lymphocytes. B_cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are
derived from hematopoietic_stem_cells in the bone_marrow.[33] B cells are
involved in the humoral_immune_response, whereas T cells are involved in cell-
mediated_immune_response.
Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class_I_MHC molecules, while
helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class
II_MHC molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the
different roles of the two types of T cell. A third, minor subtype are the Î³Î´
T_cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.[58]
The double-positive T cells are exposed to a wide variety of self-antigens in
the thymus, in which iodine is necessary for its thymus development and
activity.[59]
In contrast, the B cell antigen-specific receptor is an antibody molecule on
the B cell surface, and recognizes whole pathogens without any need for antigen
processing. Each lineage of B cell expresses a different antibody, so the
complete set of B cell antigen receptors represent all the antibodies that the
body can manufacture.[33]
**** Antigen presentation to T lymphocytes[edit] ****
Both B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific
targets. T cells recognize a "non-self" target, such as a pathogen, only after
antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in
combination with a "self" receptor called a major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecule.
**** Cell mediated immunity[edit] ****
There are two major subtypes of T cells: the killer_T_cell and the helper_T
cell. In addition there are regulatory_T_cells which have a role in modulating
immune response.
*** Killer T cells[edit] ***
Killer_T_cells are a sub-group of T cells that kill cells that are infected
with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.
[60] As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen.
Killer T cells are activated when their T-cell_receptor (TCR) binds to this
specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell.
Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T
cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of
cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell
contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores
in the target cell's plasma_membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter.
The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target
cell to undergo apoptosis.[61] T cell killing of host cells is particularly
important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is
tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation
signal, or additional activation signals provided by "helper" T cells (see
below).[61]
*** Helper T cells[edit] ***
Function of T helper cells: Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present antigen on
their Class II MHC molecules (MHC2). Helper T cells recognize these, with the
help of their expression of CD4 co-receptor (CD4+). The activation of a resting
helper T cell causes it to release cytokines and other stimulatory signals
(green arrows) that stimulate the activity of macrophages, killer_T_cells and B
cells, the latter producing antibodies. The stimulation of B cells and
macrophages succeeds a proliferation of T helper cells.
Helper_T_cells regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses and help
determine which immune responses the body makes to a particular pathogen.[62]
[63] These cells have no cytotoxic activity and do not kill infected cells or
clear pathogens directly. They instead control the immune response by directing
other cells to perform these tasks.
Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to
Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the
helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell
(e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation. Helper T cells
have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer
T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200â300) on the helper T cell must be
bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T
cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T
cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-
presenting cell.[64] The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to
release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine
signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of
macrophages and the activity of killer T cells.[7] In addition, helper T cell
activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's
surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra
stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.
[65]
*** Gamma delta T cells[edit] ***
Gamma_delta_T_cells (Î³Î´ T cells) possess an alternative T-cell_receptor (TCR)
as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ (Î±Î²) T cells and share the characteristics of
helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce
responses from Î³Î´ T cells are not fully understood. Like other
'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted
Natural_Killer_T_cells, Î³Î´ T cells straddle the border between innate and
adaptive immunity.[66] On one hand, Î³Î´ T cells are a component of adaptive
immunity as they rearrange_TCR_genes to produce receptor diversity and can also
develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets are also
part of the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used
as pattern_recognition_receptors. For example, large numbers of human VÎ³9/VÎ´2
T cells respond within hours to common_molecules produced by microbes, and
highly restricted VÎ´1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial
cells.[58]
An antibody is made up of two heavy chains and two light chains. The unique
variable region allows an antibody to recognize its matching antigen.[67]
**** The humoral immune response[edit] ****
A B_cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific
foreign antigen.[68] This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell
and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these
antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules. This combination of
MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines
and activates the B cell.[69] As the activated B cell then begins to divide,
its offspring (plasma_cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that
recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph,
bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by
complement_activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies
can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by
interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.
[70]
**** Immunological memory[edit] ****
Further information: Immunity_(medical)
When B cells and T cells are activated and begin to replicate, some of their
offspring become long-lived memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal,
these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a
strong response if the pathogen is detected again. This is "adaptive" because
it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection
with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges.
Immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or
active long-term memory.
The time-course of an immune response begins with the initial pathogen
encounter, (or initial vaccination) and leads to the formation and maintenance
of active immunological memory.
***** Physiological regulation[edit] *****
The immune system is involved in many aspects of physiological regulation in
the body. The immune system interacts intimately with other systems, such as
the endocrine [71][72] and the nervous [73][74][75] systems. The immune system
also plays a crucial role in embryogenesis (development of the embryo), as well
as in tissue repair and regeneration.
**** Hormones[edit] ****
Hormones can act as immunomodulators, altering the sensitivity of the immune
system. For example, female_sex_hormones are known immunostimulators of both
adaptive[76] and innate immune responses.[77] Some autoimmune diseases such as
lupus_erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often
coincides with puberty. By contrast, male_sex_hormones such as testosterone
seem to be immunosuppressive.[78] Other hormones appear to regulate the immune
system as well, most notably prolactin, growth_hormone and vitamin_D.[79][80]
**** Vitamin D[edit] ****
When a T-cell encounters a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin_D_receptor.
This is essentially a signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the
active form of vitamin_D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a
symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a
vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of
vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the
gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol
into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol
can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are
known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic
cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.[81][82]
It is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is
partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals.[83]
Conversely, some hormones are regulated by the immune system, notably thyroid
hormone activity.[84] The age-related decline in immune function is also
related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two
things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay
indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less
sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB_radiation. Second, as a
person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.[85]
**** Sleep and rest[edit] ****
The immune system is affected by sleep and rest,[86] and sleep_deprivation is
detrimental to immune function.[87] Complex feedback loops involving cytokines,
such as interleukin-1 and tumor_necrosis_factor-Î± produced in response to
infection, appear to also play a role in the regulation of non-rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep.[88] Thus the immune response to infection may result in
changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave_sleep relative
to REM sleep.[89]
When suffering from sleep deprivation, active immunizations may have a
diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower
immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally,
proteins such as NFIL3, which have been shown to be closely intertwined with
both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through
the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep
deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an
increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.
[90]
In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation, sleep and the
intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects
on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity.
First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of
cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the
hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce
a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These
cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation,
proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that
undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like naÃ¯ve and central memory T
cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response).
In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time
(leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions
between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one
that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and naÃ¯ve T
cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the
formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune
responses.[91]
In contrast, during wake periods differentiated effector cells, such as
cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in
order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well
during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and
catecholamines, peak. There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory
state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious
cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times.
Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of
melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative_stress and the
presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical
production during this time.[91][92]
**** Nutrition and diet[edit] ****
Overnutrition is associated with diseases such as diabetes and obesity, which
are known to affect immune function. More moderate malnutrition, as well as
certain specific trace mineral and nutrient deficiencies, can also compromise
the immune response.[93]
Foods rich in certain fatty_acids may foster a healthy immune system.[94]
Likewise, fetal_undernourishment can cause a lifelong impairment of the immune
system.[95]
**** Repair and regeneration[edit] ****
The immune system, particularly the innate component, plays a decisive role in
tissue repair after an insult.[96][97][98][99][100] Key actors include
macrophages and neutrophils, but other cellular actors, including Î³Î´ T cells,
innate_lymphoid_cells (ILCs), and regulatory_T_cells (Tregs), are also
important. The plasticity of immune cells and the balance between pro-
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals are crucial aspects of efficient
tissue repair.[100] Immune components and pathways are involved in regeneration
as well, for example in amphibians. According to one hypothesis, organisms that
can regenerate could be less immunocompetent than organisms that cannot
regenerate.[101][102]
***** Disorders of human immunity[edit] *****
The immune system is a remarkably effective structure that incorporates
specificity, inducibility and adaptation. Failures of host defense do occur,
however, and fall into three broad categories: immunodeficiencies,
autoimmunity, and hypersensitivities.
**** Immunodeficiencies[edit] ****
Further information: Immunodeficiency
Immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune
system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens
is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses
beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence.[103]
[104] In developed_countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common
causes of poor immune function.[104] However, malnutrition is the most common
cause of immunodeficiency in developing_countries.[104] Diets lacking
sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity,
complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and
cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age
through genetic_mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency
and a high susceptibility to infection.[105]
Immunodeficiencies can also be inherited or 'acquired'.[7] Chronic
granulomatous_disease, where phagocytes have a reduced ability to destroy
pathogens, is an example of an inherited, or congenital,_immunodeficiency. AIDS
and some types of cancer cause acquired immunodeficiency.[106][107]
**** Autoimmunity[edit] ****
Further information: Autoimmunity
Overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction,
particularly the autoimmune_disorders. Here, the immune system fails to
properly distinguish between self and non-self, and attacks part of the body.
Under normal circumstances, many T cells and antibodies react with "self"
peptides.[108] One of the functions of specialized cells (located in the thymus
and bone_marrow) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced
throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens,
preventing autoimmunity.[68]
**** Hypersensitivity[edit] ****
Further information: Hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues.
They are divided into four classes (Type I â IV) based on the mechanisms
involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I
hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated
with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I
hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast_cells
and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.[109] Type II hypersensitivity
occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking
them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic)
hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies.[109] Immune
complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM
antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity
reactions.[109] Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or
delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to
develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious
diseases, but may also involve contact_dermatitis (poison_ivy). These reactions
are mediated by T_cells, monocytes, and macrophages.[109]
**** Idiopathic inflammation[edit] ****
Further information: Immune-mediated_inflammatory_diseases
Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection,
[48] but it can appear without known cause.
Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by
injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce
fever and the dilation of blood_vessels associated with inflammation, and
leukotrienes that attract certain white_blood_cells (leukocytes).[49][50]
Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication
between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons
that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein_synthesis in the
host cell.[51] Growth_factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These
cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and
promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.[52]
***** Manipulation in medicine[edit] *****
The immunosuppressive_drug dexamethasone
The immune response can be manipulated to suppress unwanted responses resulting
from autoimmunity, allergy, and transplant_rejection, and to stimulate
protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the immune system
(see immunization) or cancer.
**** Immunosuppression[edit] ****
Immunosuppressive_drugs are used to control autoimmune disorders or
inflammation when excessive tissue damage occurs, and to prevent transplant
rejection after an organ_transplant.[33][110]
Anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation.
Glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs; however, these drugs can
have many undesirable side_effects, such as central_obesity, hyperglycemia,
osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled.[111] Lower doses of
anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or
immunosuppressive_drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine. Cytotoxic_drugs
inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated T
cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly_dividing
cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects.[110]
Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to
signals correctly by inhibiting signal_transduction pathways.[112]
**** Immunostimulation[edit] ****
Main articles: Immunotherapy and Vaccination
Cancer_immunotherapy covers the medical ways to stimulate the immune system to
attack cancer tumours.
**** Vaccination[edit] ****
Long-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and
T cells. Active immunity can also be generated artificially, through
vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to
introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system
and develop specific_immunity against that particular pathogen without causing
disease associated with that organism.[7] This deliberate induction of an
immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of
the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease
remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population,
vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system
mankind has developed.[33][113]
Most viral vaccines are based on live attenuated viruses, while many bacterial
vaccines are based on acellular components of micro-organisms, including
harmless toxin components.[7] Since many antigens derived from acellular
vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines
are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting
cells of the innate_immune_system and maximize immunogenicity.[114]
**** Tumor immunology[edit] ****
Further information: Cancer_immunology
Macrophages have identified a cancer cell (the large, spiky mass). Upon fusing
with the cancer cell, the macrophages (smaller white cells) inject toxins that
kill the tumor cell. Immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer is an active
area of medical research.[115]
Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate
tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors
express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system,
these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack
the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several
sources;[116] some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human
papillomavirus, which causes cervical_cancer,[117] while others are the
organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high
levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when
expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into
tumors called melanomas.[118][119] A third possible source of tumor antigens
are proteins normally important for regulating cell_growth and survival, that
commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.[116][120][121]
The main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal
cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells.
[119][122] Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar
way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell
as abnormal.[123] NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way,
especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface
than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors.[124] Sometimes antibodies
are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the
complement_system.[120]
Clearly, some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers.[125]
[126] Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules on their
surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells.[123][125] Some tumor cells
also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by
secreting the cytokine TGF-Î², which suppresses the activity of macrophages and
lymphocytes.[125][127] In addition, immunological_tolerance may develop against
tumor antigens, so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells.[125]
[126]
Paradoxically, macrophages can promote tumor growth [128] when tumor cells send
out cytokines that attract macrophages, which then generate cytokines and
growth factors such as tumor-necrosis_factor_alpha that nurture tumor
development or promote stem-cell-like plasticity.[125] In addition, a
combination of hypoxia in the tumor and a cytokine produced by macrophages
induces tumor cells to decrease production of a protein that blocks metastasis
and thereby assists spread of cancer cells.[125]
**** Predicting immunogenicity[edit] ****
Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly
if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the
effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are
typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not
immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is
sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods have been developed to
predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly
useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of
mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based
drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that
hydrophilic amino_acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic
amino acids;[129] however, more recent developments rely on machine_learning
techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied
virus proteins, as a training_set.[130] A publicly accessible database has been
established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be
recognizable by B cells.[131] The emerging field of bioinformatics-based
studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics.[132]
Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved
in the immune response.
***** Evolution and other mechanisms[edit] *****
Further information: Innate_immune_system_Â§ Other_forms_of_innate_immunity
**** Evolution of the immune system[edit] ****
It is likely that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first
vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based
humoral response.[1] Many species, however, utilize mechanisms that appear to
be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear
even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a
unique defense mechanism, called the restriction_modification_system to protect
themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages.[133] Prokaryotes also
possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to
retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with
in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA
interference.[134][135] Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms.[136]
[137] Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular
eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.[138]
Pattern_recognition_receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to
identify molecules associated with pathogens. Antimicrobial_peptides called
defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune
response found in all animals and plants, and represent the main form of
invertebrate systemic immunity.[1] The complement_system and phagocytic cells
are also used by most forms of invertebrate life. Ribonucleases and the RNA
interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes, and are thought to
play a role in the immune response to viruses.[139]
Unlike animals, plants lack phagocytic cells, but many plant immune responses
involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant.[140]
Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as
Pathogen-associated_molecular_patterns or PAMPs.[141] When a part of a plant
becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive_response,
whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the
spread of the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic_acquired_resistance
(SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire
plant resistant to a particular infectious agent.[140] RNA_silencing mechanisms
are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus
replication.[142]
**** Alternative adaptive immune system[edit] ****
Evolution_of_the_adaptive_immune_system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed
vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system
(e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell_receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates.
However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in
primitive jawless_vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals
possess a large array of molecules called Variable_lymphocyte_receptors (VLRs)
that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from only a
small number (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind
pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of
specificity.[143]
**** Manipulation by pathogens[edit] ****
The success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune
responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to
successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the
immune system.[144] Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting
enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type_II_secretion
system.[145] Alternatively, using a type_III_secretion_system, they may insert
a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move
from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host
defenses.[146]
An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system
is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular
pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host
cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies
and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the
food_poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause
malaria (Plasmodium_falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other
bacteria, such as Mycobacterium_tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule
that prevents lysis by complement.[147] Many pathogens secrete compounds that
diminish or misdirect the host's immune response.[144] Some bacteria form
biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune
system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the
chronic Pseudomonas_aeruginosa and Burkholderia_cenocepacia infections
characteristic of cystic_fibrosis.[148] Other bacteria generate surface
proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include
Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus_aureus (protein A), and
Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).[149]
The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated.
The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino_acids
and/or sugars) on the surface of the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes
concealed. This is called antigenic_variation. An example is HIV, which mutates
rapidly, so the proteins on its viral_envelope that are essential for entry
into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in
antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus.[150] The
parasite Trypanosoma_brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one
type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the
antibody response.[151] Masking antigens with host molecules is another common
strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that
covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such
"self-cloaked" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them
as "non-self" structures.[152]
***** History of immunology[edit] *****
Further information: History_of_immunology
Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune
system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity
to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague_of
Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a
previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the
illness a second time.[153] In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis_Moreau_de
Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs
and mice were immune to this venom.[154] In the 10th century, Persian physician
al-Razi (also known as Rhazes) wrote the first recorded theory of acquired
immunity,[155][156]:6 noting that a smallpox bout protected its survivors from
future infections. Although he explained the immunity in terms of "excess
moisture" getting expelled from the bloodâtherefore preventing the disease to
occur for a second timeâthis theory explained many observations about
smallpox known during this time.[156]:7
These and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis
Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ_theory_of
disease.[157] Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary
theories of disease, such as the miasma_theory. It was not until Robert_Koch's
1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel_Prize in 1905, that
microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious_disease.[158] Viruses
were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow
fever virus by Walter_Reed.[159]
Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through
rapid developments, in the study of humoral_immunity and cellular_immunity.
[160] Particularly important was the work of Paul_Ehrlich, who proposed the
side-chain_theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody_reaction;
his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by
the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of
cellular immunology, Elie_Metchnikoff.[161]
**** Theoretical approaches to the immune system[edit] ****
Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also
characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude. Many theories have been
suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the
present time. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century
saw a battle between "cellular" and "humoral" theories of immunity. According
to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie
Metchnikoff, it was cellsâmore precisely, phagocytesâthat were responsible
for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among
others, by Robert_Koch and Emil_von_Behring, stated that the active immune
agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism's âhumorsâ
rather than its cells.[156][162][163]
In the mid-1950s, Frank_Burnet, inspired by a suggestion made by Niels_Jerne,
[164] formulated the clonal_selection_theory (CST) of immunity.[165] On the
basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered
according to the self/nonself distinction: "self" constituents (constituents of
the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while "nonself" entities
(pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response.[166] The
theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding
histocompatibility or the complex "two-signal" activation of T cells.[167] The
self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been
criticized,[163][168][169] but remain very influential.[170][171]
More recently, several theoretical frameworks have been suggested in
immunology, including "autopoietic" views,[172] "cognitive immune" views,[173]
the "danger_model" (or "danger theory"),[168] and the "discontinuity" theory.
[174][175][176] The danger model, suggested by Polly_Matzinger and colleagues,
has been very influential, arousing many comments and discussions.[177][178]
