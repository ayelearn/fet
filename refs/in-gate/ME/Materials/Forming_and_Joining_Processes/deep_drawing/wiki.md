Example of deep drawn part
Deep drawing is a sheet_metal forming process in which a sheet metal blank is
radially drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch.[1] It is
thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is
considered "deep" drawing when the depth of the drawn part exceeds its
diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The
flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial
drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material
retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop_stresses) result in flange
wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a
blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow
into the die radius.

***** Process[edit] *****
The total drawing load consists of the ideal forming load and an additional
component to compensate for friction in the contacting areas of the flange
region and bending forces as well as unbending forces at the die radius. The
forming load is transferred from the punch radius through the drawn part wall
into the deformation region (sheet metal flange). In the drawn part wall, which
is in contact with the punch, the hoop strain is zero whereby the plane_strain
condition is reached. In reality, mostly the strain condition is only
approximately plane. Due to tensile forces acting in the part wall, wall
thinning is prominent and results in an uneven part wall thickness, such that
the part wall thickness is lowest at the point where the part wall loses
contact with the punch, i.e., at the punch radius.
The thinnest part thickness determines the maximum stress that can be
transferred to the deformation zone. Due to material volume constancy, the
flange thickens and results in blank holder contact at the outer boundary
rather than on the entire surface. The maximum stress that can be safely
transferred from the punch to the blank sets a limit on the maximum blank size
(initial blank diameter in the case of rotationally symmetrical blanks). An
indicator of material formability is the limiting drawing ratio (LDR), defined
as the ratio of the maximum blank diameter that can be safely drawn into a cup
without flange to the punch diameter. Determination of the LDR for complex
components is difficult and hence the part is inspected for critical areas for
which an approximation is possible. During severe deep drawing the material
work hardens and it may be necessary to anneal the parts in controlled
atmosphere ovens to restore the original elasticity of the material.
Commercial applications of this metal shaping process often involve complex
geometries with straight sides and radii. In such a case, the term stamping is
used in order to distinguish between the deep drawing (radial tension-
tangential compression) and stretch-and-bend (along the straight sides)
components. Deep drawing is always accompanied by other forming techniques
within the press. These other forming methods include:[2]
    * Beading: Material is displaced to create a larger, or smaller, diameter
      ring of material beyond the original body diameter of a part, often used
      to create O-ring seats.
    * Bottom Piercing: A round or shaped portion of metal is cut from the drawn
      part.
    * Bulging: In the bulging process a portion of the part's diameter is
      forced to protrude from the surrounding geometry.
    * Coining: Material is displaced to form specific shapes in the part.
      Typically coining should not exceed a depth of 30% of the material
      thickness.
    * Curling: Metal is rolled under a curling die to create a rolled edge.
    * Extruding: After a pilot hole is pierced, a larger diameter punch is
      pushed through, causing the metal to expand and grow in length.
    * Ironing / Wall Thinning: Ironing is a process to reduce the wall
      thickness of parts. Typically ironing should not exceed a depth of 30% of
      the material thickness.
    * Necking: A portion of the part is reduced in diameter to less than the
      major diameter.
    * Notching: A notch is cut into the open end of the part. This notch can be
      round, square, or shaped.
    * Rib Forming: Rib forming involves creating an inward or outward
      protruding rib during the drawing process.
    * Side Piercing: Holes are pierced in the side wall of the drawn part. The
      holes may be round or shaped according to specifications.
    * Stamping / Marking: This process is typically used to put identification
      on a part, such as a part number or supplier identification.
    * Threading: Using a wheel and arbor, threads are formed into a part. In
      this way threaded parts can be produced within the stamping press.
    * Trimming: In the Trimming process, excess metal that is necessary to draw
      the part is cut away from the finished part.
Often components are partially deep draw in order to create a series of
diameters throughout the component (as in the image of the deep draw line). It
common use to consider this process as a cost saving alternative to turned
parts which require much more raw material.
Example of deep drawn line
The sequence of deep drawn components is referred to as a "deep draw line". The
numbers of components that form the deep draw line is given by the quantity of
"stations" available in the press. In the case of mechanical presses this is
determined by the number of cams on the top shaft.
For high precision mass productions, it is always advisable to use a transfer
press also known as eyelet press. The advantage of this type of press, in
respect to conventional progressive presses, is that the parts are transferred
from one die to the next by means of so-called "fingers". Not only do the
fingers transfer the parts but they also guide the component during the
process. This allows parts to be drawn to the deepest depths with the tightest
tolerances.
Other types of presses:[3]
    * Die-Set Transfer Press: Part is transferred via transfer fingers as the
      part progresses through the forming process. Tooling components attached
      to die plates enable the die to be installed in the press as one unit.
    * ICOP (Individually Cam Operated Press): The part is transferred via
      transfer fingers as the part progresses through the forming process. Die
      components are installed in the press one station at a time.
    * Progressive Die Press: The part is carried on the steel webbing as it
      progresses through the forming process.
***** Variations[edit] *****
Deep drawing has been classified into conventional and unconventional deep
drawing. The main aim of any unconventional deep drawing process is to extend
the formability limits of the process. Some of the unconventional processes
include hydromechanical deep drawing, Hydroform process, Aquadraw process,
Guerin process, Marform process and the hydraulic deep drawing process to name
a few.
The Marform process, for example, operates using the principle of rubber pad
forming techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls
can be formed. In this type of forming, the die rig employs a rubber pad as one
tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set,
to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys
and the rubber pad is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For
Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with die cushions and blank
holders. The blank is held against the rubber pad by a blank holder, through
which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting
apparatus: at first the ram slides down, then the blank holder moves: this
feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with
no wrinkles.[4][5][6][7][8]
Industrial uses of deep drawing processes include automotive body and
structural parts, aircraft components, utensils and white goods. Complex parts
are normally formed using progressive dies in a single forming press or by
using a press line.
***** Workpiece materials and power requirements[edit] *****
Softer materials are much easier to deform and therefore require less force to
draw. The following is a table demonstrating the draw force to percent
reduction of commonly used materials.
Drawing force required for various
 materials and reductions [kN][9]
Material          Percent reduction
                  39% 43% 47% 50%
Aluminium         88  101 113 126
Brass             117 134 151 168
Cold-rolled steel 127 145 163 181
Stainless steel   166 190 214 238
***** Tool materials[edit] *****
Punches and dies are typically made of tool_steel, however cheaper (but softer)
carbon_steel is sometimes used in less severe applications. It is also common
to see cemented carbides used where high wear and abrasive resistance is
present. Alloy_steels are normally used for the ejector system to kick the part
out and in durable and heat resistant blankholders.[10]
***** Lubrication and cooling[edit] *****
Lubricants are used to reduce friction between the working material and the
punch and die. They also aid in removing the part from the punch. Some examples
of lubricants used in drawing operations are heavy-duty emulsions, phosphates,
white_lead, and wax films. Plastic films covering both sides of the part while
used with a lubricant will leave the part with a fine surface.
