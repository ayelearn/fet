This article is about the metal-joining process. For the cooking technique, see
braising.
Brazing practice
Brazing is a metal-joining process in which two or more metal items are joined
together by melting and flowing a filler_metal into the joint, the filler metal
having a lower melting point than the adjoining metal.
Brazing differs from welding in that it does not involve melting the work
pieces and from soldering in using higher temperatures for a similar process,
while also requiring much more closely fitted parts than when soldering. The
filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary
action. The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting (liquidus)
temperature while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then
flows over the base metal (known as wetting) and is then cooled to join the
work pieces together.[1] A major advantage of brazing is the ability to join
the same or different metals with considerable strength.

***** Basics[edit] *****
High-quality brazed joints require that parts be closely fitted, and the base
metals exceptionally clean and free of oxides. In most cases, joint clearances
of 0.03 to 0.08 mm (0.0012 to 0.0031 in) are recommended for the best capillary
action and joint strength.[2] However, in some brazing operations it is not
uncommon to have joint clearances around 0.6 mm (0.024 in). Cleanliness of the
brazing surfaces is also important, as any contamination can cause poor wetting
(flow). The two main methods for cleaning parts, prior to brazing, are chemical
cleaning and abrasive or mechanical cleaning. In the case of mechanical
cleaning, it is important to maintain the proper surface roughness as wetting
on a rough surface occurs much more readily than on a smooth surface of the
same geometry.[2]
Another consideration is the effect of temperature and time on the quality of
brazed joints. As the temperature of the braze alloy is increased, the alloying
and wetting action of the filler metal increases as well. In general, the
brazing temperature selected must be above the melting point of the filler
metal. However, several factors influence the joint designer's temperature
selection. The best temperature is usually selected to:
    * Be the lowest possible braze temperature
    * Minimize any heat effects on the assembly
    * Minimize filler metal/base metal interaction
    * Maximize the life of any fixtures or jigs used[2]
In some cases, a worker may select a higher temperature to accommodate other
factors in the design (e.g., to allow use of a different filler metal, or to
control metallurgical effects, or to sufficiently remove surface
contamination). The effect of time on the brazed joint primarily affects the
extent to which these effects are present. In general, however, most production
processes are selected to minimize brazing time and associated costs. This is
not always the case, however, since in some non-production settings, time and
cost are secondary to other joint attributes (e.g., strength, appearance).
**** Flux[edit] ****
Unless brazing operations are contained within an inert or reducing_atmosphere
environment (i.e. a vacuum furnace), a flux such as borax is required to
prevent oxides from forming while the metal is heated. The flux also serves the
purpose of cleaning any contamination left on the brazing surfaces. Flux can be
applied in any number of forms including flux paste, liquid, powder or pre-made
brazing pastes that combine flux with filler metal powder. Flux can also be
applied using brazing rods with a coating of flux, or a flux core. In either
case, the flux flows into the joint when applied to the heated joint and is
displaced by the molten filler metal entering the joint. Excess flux should be
removed when the cycle is completed because flux left in the joint can lead to
corrosion, impede joint inspection, and prevent further surface finishing
operations. Phosphorus-containing brazing alloys can be self-fluxing when
joining copper to copper.[3] Fluxes are generally selected based on their
performance on particular base metals. To be effective, the flux must be
chemically compatible with both the base metal and the filler metal being used.
Self-fluxing phosphorus filler alloys produce brittle phosphides if used on
iron or nickel.[3] As a general rule, longer brazing cycles should use less
active fluxes than short brazing operations.[4]
**** Filler materials[edit] ****
A variety of alloys are used as filler metals for brazing depending on the
intended use or application method. In general, braze alloys are made up of 3
or more metals to form an alloy with the desired properties. The filler metal
for a particular application is chosen based on its ability to: wet the base
metals, withstand the service conditions required, and melt at a lower
temperature than the base metals or at a very specific temperature.
Braze alloy is generally available as rod, ribbon, powder, paste, cream, wire
and preforms (such as stamped washers).[5] Depending on the application, the
filler material can be pre-placed at the desired location or applied during the
heating cycle. For manual brazing, wire and rod forms are generally used as
they are the easiest to apply while heating. In the case of furnace brazing,
alloy is usually placed beforehand since the process is usually highly
automated.[5] Some of the more common types of filler metals used are
    * Aluminum-silicon
    * Copper
    * Copper-silver
    * Copper-zinc (brass)
    * Copper-tin (bronze)
    * Gold-silver
    * Nickel alloy
    * Silver[1][6]
    * Amorphous_brazing_foil using nickel, iron, copper, silicon, boron,
      phosphorus, etc.
**** Atmosphere[edit] ****
As brazing work requires high temperatures, oxidation of the metal surface
occurs in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. This may necessitate the use of an
atmospheric environment other than air. The commonly used atmospheres are[7][8]
    * Air: Simple and economical. Many materials susceptible to oxidation and
      buildup of scale. Acid cleaning bath or mechanical cleaning can be used
      to remove the oxidation after work. Flux counteracts the oxidation, but
      may weaken the joint.
    * Combusted fuel gas (low hydrogen, AWS type 1, "exothermic generated
      atmospheres"): 87% N2, 11â12% CO2, 5-1% CO, 5-1% H2. For silver,
      copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper and
      brass.
    * Combusted fuel gas (decarburizing, AWS type 2, "endothermic generated
      atmospheres"): 70â71% N2, 5â6% CO2, 9â10% CO, 14â15% H2. For
      copper, silver, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For
      brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium carbon_steels.
    * Combusted fuel gas (dried, AWS type 3, "endothermic generated
      atmospheres"): 73â75% N2, 10â11% CO, 15â16% H2. For copper, silver,
      copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper,
      brass, low-nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon_steels.
    * Combusted fuel gas (dried, decarburizing, AWS type 4): 41â45% N2,
      17â19% CO, 38â40% H2. For copper, silver, copper-phosphorus and
      copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, low-nickel alloys,
      medium and high carbon_steels.
    * Ammonia (AWS type 5, also called forming_gas): Dissociated ammonia (75%
      hydrogen, 25% nitrogen) can be used for many types of brazing and
      annealing. Inexpensive. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and
      copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys,
      Monel, medium and high carbon_steels and chromium alloys.
    * Nitrogen+hydrogen, cryogenic or purified (AWS type 6A): 70â99% N2,
      1â30% H2. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc
      filler metals.
    * Nitrogen+hydrogen+carbon monoxide, cryogenic or purified (AWS type 6B):
      70â99% N2, 2â20% H2, 1â10% CO. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-
      phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, low-
      nickel alloys, medium and high carbon_steels.
    * Nitrogen, cryogenic or purified (AWS type 6C): Non-oxidizing, economical.
      At high temperatures can react with some metals, e.g. certain steels,
      forming nitrides. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and
      copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, low-nickel alloys,
      Monel, medium and high carbon_steels.
    * Hydrogen (AWS type 7): Strong deoxidizer, highly thermally conductive.
      Can be used for copper brazing and annealing steel. May cause hydrogen
      embrittlement to some alloys. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-
      phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass,
      nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon_steels and chromium alloys,
      cobalt alloys, tungsten alloys, and carbides.
    * Inorganic vapors (various volatile fluorides, AWS type 8): Special
      purpose. Can be mixed with atmospheres AWS 1â5 to replace flux. Used
      for silver-brazing of brasses.
    * Noble_gas (usually argon, AWS type 9): Non-oxidizing, more expensive than
      nitrogen. Inert. Parts must be very clean, gas must be pure. For copper,
      silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For
      brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium and high carbon
      steels chromium alloys, titanium, zirconium, hafnium.
    * Noble gas+hydrogen (AWS type 9A)
    * Vacuum: Requires evacuating the work chamber. Expensive. Unsuitable (or
      requires special care) for metals with high vapor pressure, e.g. silver,
      zinc, phosphorus, cadmium, and manganese. Used for highest-quality
      joints, for e.g. aerospace applications.

Brazing and soldering processes classification_chart[9]
**** Torch brazing[edit] ****
Torch brazing is by far the most common method of mechanized brazing in use. It
is best used in small production volumes or in specialized operations, and in
some countries, it accounts for a majority of the brazing taking place. There
are three main categories of torch brazing in use:[10] manual, machine, and
automatic torch brazing.
Manual torch brazing is a procedure where the heat is applied using a gas_flame
placed on or near the joint being brazed. The torch can either be hand held or
held in a fixed position depending on whether the operation is completely
manual or has some level of automation. Manual brazing is most commonly used on
small production volumes or in applications where the part size or
configuration makes other brazing methods impossible.[10] The main drawback is
the high labor cost associated with the method as well as the operator skill
required to obtain quality brazed joints. The use of flux or self-fluxing
material is required to prevent oxidation. Torch brazing of copper can be done
without the use of flux if it is brazed with a torch using oxygen and hydrogen
gas, rather than oxygen and other flammable gases.
Machine torch brazing is commonly used where a repetitive braze operation is
being carried out. This method is a mix of both automated and manual operations
with an operator often placing brazes material, flux and jigging parts while
the machine mechanism carries out the actual braze.[10] The advantage of this
method is that it reduces the high labor and skill requirement of manual
brazing. The use of flux is also required for this method as there is no
protective atmosphere, and it is best suited to small to medium production
volumes.
Automatic torch brazing is a method that almost eliminates the need for manual
labor in the brazing operation, except for loading and unloading of the
machine. The main advantages of this method are: a high production rate,
uniform braze quality, and reduced operating cost. The equipment used is
essentially the same as that used for Machine torch brazing, with the main
difference being that the machinery replaces the operator in the part
preparation.[10]
**** Furnace brazing[edit] ****
Furnace brazing schematic
Furnace brazing is a semi-automatic process used widely in industrial brazing
operations due to its adaptability to mass production and use of unskilled
labor. There are many advantages of furnace brazing over other heating methods
that make it ideal for mass production. One main advantage is the ease with
which it can produce large numbers of small parts that are easily jigged or
self-locating.[11] The process also offers the benefits of a controlled heat
cycle (allowing use of parts that might distort under localized heating) and no
need for post braze cleaning. Common atmospheres used include: inert, reducing
or vacuum atmospheres all of which protect the part from oxidation. Some other
advantages include: low unit cost when used in mass production, close
temperature control, and the ability to braze multiple joints at once. Furnaces
are typically heated using either electric, gas or oil depending on the type of
furnace and application. However, some of the disadvantages of this method
include: high capital equipment cost, more difficult design considerations and
high power consumption.[11]
There are four main types of furnaces used in brazing operations: batch type;
continuous; retort with controlled atmosphere; and vacuum.
A batch type furnace has relatively low initial equipment costs, and can heat
each part load separately. It can turned on and off at will, which reduces
operating expenses when it's not in use. These furnaces are suited to medium to
large volume production, and offer a large degree of flexibility in type of
parts that can be brazed.[11] Either controlled atmospheres or flux can be used
to control oxidation and cleanliness of parts.
Continuous type furnaces are best suited to a steady flow of similar-sized
parts through the furnace.[11] These furnaces are often conveyor fed, moving
parts through the hot zone at a controlled speed. It is common to use either
controlled atmosphere or pre-applied flux in continuous furnaces. In
particular, these furnaces offer the benefit of very low manual labor
requirements and so are best suited to large scale production operations.
Retort-type furnaces differ from other batch-type furnaces in that they make
use of a sealed lining called a "retort". The retort is generally sealed with
either a gasket or is welded shut and filled completely with the desired
atmosphere and then heated externally by conventional heating elements.[11] Due
to the high temperatures involved, the retort is usually made of heat resistant
alloys that resist oxidation. Retort furnaces are often either used in a batch
or semi-continuous versions.
Vacuum furnaces is a relatively economical method of oxide prevention and is
most often used to braze materials with very stable oxides (aluminum, titanium
and zirconium) that cannot be brazed in atmosphere furnaces. Vacuum brazing is
also used heavily with refractory materials and other exotic alloy combinations
unsuited to atmosphere furnaces. Due to the absence of flux or a reducing
atmosphere, the part cleanliness is critical when brazing in a vacuum. The
three main types of vacuum furnace are: single-wall hot retort, double-walled
hot retort, and cold-wall retort. Typical vacuum levels for brazing range from
pressures of 1.3 to 0.13 pascals (10â2 to 10â3 Torr) to 0.00013 Pa (10â6
Torr) or lower.[11] Vacuum furnaces are most commonly batch-type, and they are
suited to medium and high production volumes.
**** Silver brazing[edit] ****
Silver brazing, sometimes known as a hard soldering, is brazing using a silver
alloy based filler. These silver alloys consist of many different percentages
of silver and other metals, such as copper, zinc and cadmium.

Brazing is widely used in the tool industry to fasten "hard_metal" (carbide,
ceramics, cermet, and similar) tips to tools such as saw blades. "Pretinning"
is often done: the braze alloy is melted onto the hard metal tip, which is
placed next to the steel and remelted. Pretinning gets around the problem that
hard metals are difficult to wet.
Brazed hard metal joints are typically two to seven mils thick. The braze alloy
joins the materials and compensates for the difference in their expansion
rates. It also provides a cushion between the hard carbide tip and the hard
steel, which softens impact and prevents tip loss and damageâmuch as a
vehicle's suspension helps prevent damage to the tires and the vehicle.
Finally, the braze alloy joins the other two materials to create a composite
structure, much as layers of wood and glue create plywood. The standard for
braze joint strength in many industries is a joint that is stronger than either
base material, so that when under stress, one or other of the base materials
fails before the joint. Silver bracing may cause defects in certain alloys,
e.g. stress-induced inter-granular cracking in copper-nickel.
One special silver brazing method is called pinbrazing or pin_brazing. It has
been developed especially for connecting cables to railway track or for
cathodic_protection installations. The method uses a silver- and flux-
containing brazing pin, which is melted in the eye of a cable lug. The
equipment is normally powered from batteries.
**** Braze welding[edit] ****
Braze welding is the use of a bronze or brass filler rod coated with flux to
join steel workpieces. The equipment needed for braze welding is basically
identical to the equipment used in brazing. Since braze welding usually
requires more heat than brazing, acetylene or methylacetylene-propadiene_(MAP)
gas fuel is commonly used. The name comes from the fact that no capillary
action is used.
Braze welding has many advantages over fusion welding. It allows the joining of
dissimilar metals, minimization of heat distortion, and can reduce the need for
extensive pre-heating. Additionally, since the metals joined are not melted in
the process, the components retain their original shape; edges and contours are
not eroded or changed by the formation of a fillet. Another effect of braze
welding is the elimination of stored-up stresses that are often present in
fusion welding. This is extremely important in the repair of large castings.
The disadvantages are the loss of strength when subjected to high temperatures
and the inability to withstand high stresses.
Carbide, cermet and ceramic tips are plated and then joined to steel to make
tipped band saws. The plating acts as a braze alloy.
**** Cast iron "welding"[edit] ****
The "welding" of cast_iron is usually a brazing operation, with a filler rod
made chiefly of nickel being used although true welding with cast iron rods is
also available. Ductile cast iron pipe may be also "cadwelded," a process that
connects joints by means of a small copper wire fused into the iron when
previously ground down to the bare metal, parallel to the iron joints being
formed as per hub pipe with neoprene gasket seals. The purpose behind this
operation is to use electricity along the copper for keeping underground pipes
warm in cold climates.
**** Vacuum brazing[edit] ****
Vacuum brazing is a material joining technique that offers significant
advantages: extremely clean, superior, flux-free braze joints of high integrity
and strength. The process can be expensive because it must be performed inside
a vacuum chamber vessel. Temperature uniformity is maintained on the work piece
when heating in a vacuum, greatly reducing residual stresses due to slow
heating and cooling cycles. This, in turn, can significantly improve the
thermal and mechanical properties of the material, thus providing unique heat
treatment capabilities. One such capability is heat-treating or age-hardening
the workpiece while performing a metal-joining process, all in a single furnace
thermal cycle.
Products that are most commonly vacuum-brazed include aluminum cold plates,
plate-fin heat exchangers, and flat tube heat exchangers.[12]
Vacuum brazing is often conducted in a furnace; this means that several joints
can be made at once because the whole workpiece reaches the brazing
temperature. The heat is transferred using radiation, as many other methods
cannot be used in a vacuum.
**** Dip brazing[edit] ****
Dip brazing is especially suited for brazing aluminium because air is excluded,
thus preventing the formation of oxides. The parts to be joined are fixtured
and the brazing compound applied to the mating surfaces, typically in slurry
form. Then the assemblies are dipped into a bath of molten salt (typically
NaCl, KCl and other compounds), which functions as both heat transfer medium
and flux. Many dip brazed parts are used in heat transfer applications for the
aerospace industry.[13]
***** Heating methods[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (September

There are many heating methods available to accomplish brazing operations. The
most important factor in choosing a heating method is achieving efficient
transfer of heat throughout the joint and doing so within the heat capacity of
the individual base metals used. The geometry of the braze joint is also a
crucial factor to consider, as is the rate and volume of production required.
The easiest way to categorize brazing methods is to group them by heating
method. Here are some of the most common:[1][14]
    * Torch brazing
    * Furnace brazing
    * Induction_brazing
    * Dip brazing
    * Resistance brazing
    * Infrared brazing
    * Blanket brazing
    * Electron beam and laser brazing
    * Braze welding
These heating methods are classified through localised and diffuse heating
techniques and offer advantages based on their different applications.[15]
***** Safety[edit] *****
Brazing may entail exposure to hazardous chemical fumes. The National_Institute
for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health in the United States recommends that
exposure to these fumes is controlled to levels below the allowed exposure
limit.[16]
***** Advantages and disadvantages[edit] *****
Brazing has many advantages over other metal-joining techniques, such as
welding. Since brazing does not melt the base metal of the joint, it allows
much tighter control over tolerances and produces a clean joint without the
need for secondary finishing. Additionally, dissimilar metals and non-metals
(i.e. metalized ceramics) can be brazed.[17] In general, brazing also produces
less thermal distortion than welding due to the uniform heating of a brazed
piece. Complex and multi-part assemblies can be brazed cost-effectively. Welded
joints must sometimes be ground flush, a costly secondary operation that
brazing does not require because it produces a clean joint. Another advantage
is that the brazing can be coated or clad for protective purposes. Finally,
brazing is easily adapted to mass production and it is easy to automate because
the individual process parameters are less sensitive to variation.[18][19]
One of the main disadvantages is the lack of joint strength as compared to a
welded joint due to the softer filler metals used.[1] The strength of the
brazed joint is likely to be less than that of the base metal(s) but greater
than the filler metal.[20] Another disadvantage is that brazed joints can be
damaged under high service temperatures.[1] Brazed joints require a high degree
of base-metal cleanliness when done in an industrial setting. Some brazing
applications require the use of adequate fluxing agents to control cleanliness.
The joint color is often different from that of the base metal, creating an
aesthetic disadvantage.
***** Filler metals[edit] *****
See also: List_of_brazing_alloys
Some brazes come in the form of trifoils, laminated foils of a carrier metal
clad with a layer of braze at each side. The center metal is often copper; its
role is to act as a carrier for the alloy, to absorb mechanical stresses due to
e.g. differential thermal expansion of dissimilar materials (e.g. a carbide tip
and a steel holder), and to act as a diffusion barrier (e.g. to stop diffusion
of aluminium from aluminium bronze to steel when brazing these two).
**** Braze families[edit] ****
Brazing alloys form several distinct groups; the alloys in the same group have
similar properties and uses.[21]
    * Pure metals
      Unalloyed. Often noble metals â silver, gold, palladium.
    * Ag-Cu
      Silver-copper. Good melting properties. Silver enhances flow. Eutectic
      alloy used for furnace brazing. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress
      cracking by ammonia.
    * Ag-Zn
      Silver-zinc. Similar to Cu-Zn, used in jewelry due to its high silver
      content so that the product is compliant with hallmarking. The color
      matches silver, and it is resistant to ammonia-containing silver-cleaning
      fluids.
    * Cu-Zn (brass)
      Copper-zinc. General purpose, used for joining steel and cast iron.
      Corrosion resistance usually inadequate for copper, silicon bronze,
      copper-nickel, and stainless steel. Reasonably ductile. High vapor
      pressure due to volatile zinc, unsuitable for furnace brazing. Copper-
      rich alloys prone to stress cracking by ammonia.
    * Ag-Cu-Zn
      Silver-copper-zinc. Lower melting point than Ag-Cu for same Ag content.
      Combines advantages of Ag-Cu and Cu-Zn. At above 40% Zn the ductility and
      strength drop, so only lower-zinc alloys of this type are used. At above
      25% zinc less ductile copper-zinc and silver-zinc phases appear. Copper
      content above 60% yields reduced strength and liquidus above 900 Â°C.
      Silver content above 85% yields reduced strength, high liquidus and high
      cost. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress cracking by ammonia. Silver-rich
      brazes (above 67.5% Ag) are hallmarkable and used in jewellery; alloys
      with lower silver content are used for engineering purposes. Alloys with
      copper-zinc ratio of about 60:40 contain the same phases as brass and
      match its color; they are used for joining brass. Small amount of nickel
      improves strength and corrosion resistance and promotes wetting of
      carbides. Addition of manganese together with nickel increases fracture
      toughness. Addition of cadmium yields Ag-Cu-Zn-Cd alloys with improved
      fluidity and wetting and lower melting point; however cadmium is toxic.
      Addition of tin can play mostly the same role.
    * Cu-P
      Copper-phosphorus. Widely used for copper and copper alloys. Does not
      require flux for copper. Can be also used with silver, tungsten, and
      molybdenum. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress cracking by ammonia.
    * Ag-Cu-P
      Like Cu-P, with improved flow. Better for larger gaps. More ductile,
      better electrical conductivity. Copper-rich alloys prone to stress
      cracking by ammonia.
    * Au-Ag
      Gold-silver. Noble metals. Used in jewelry.
    * Au-Cu
      Gold-copper. Continuous series of solid solutions. Readily wet many
      metals, including refractory ones. Narrow melting ranges, good fluidity.
      [22] Frequently used in jewellery. Alloys with 40â90% of gold harden on
      cooling but stay ductile. Nickel improves ductility. Silver lowers
      melting point but worsens corrosion resistance. To maintain corrosion
      resistance, gold must be kept above 60%. High-temperature strength and
      corrosion resistance can be improved by further alloying, e.g., with
      chromium, palladium, manganese, and molybdenum. Added vanadium allows
      wetting ceramics. Gold-copper has low vapor pressure.
    * Au-Ni
      Gold-Nickel. Continuous series of solid solutions. Wider melting range
      than Au-Cu alloys but better corrosion resistance and improved wetting.
      Frequently alloyed with other metals to reduce proportion of gold while
      maintaining properties. Copper may be added to lower gold proportion,
      chromium to compensate for loss of corrosion resistance, and boron for
      improving wetting impaired by the chromium. Generally no more than 35% Ni
      is used, as higher Ni/Au ratios have too wide melting range. Low vapor
      pressure.
    * Au-Pd
      Gold-Palladium. Improved corrosion resistance over Au-Cu and Au-Ni
      alloys. Used for joining superalloys and refractory metals for high-
      temperature applications, e.g. jet engines. Expensive. May be substituted
      for by cobalt-based brazes. Low vapor pressure.
    * Pd
      Palladium. Good high-temperature performance, high corrosion resistance
      (less than gold), high strength (more than gold). usually alloyed with
      nickel, copper, or silver. Forms solid solutions with most metals, does
      not form brittle intermetallics. Low vapor pressure.
    * Ni
      Nickel alloys, even more numerous than silver alloys. High strength.
      Lower cost than silver alloys. Good high-temperature performance, good
      corrosion resistance in moderately aggressive environments. Often used
      for stainless steels and heat-resistant alloys. Embrittled with sulfur
      and some lower-melting point metals, e.g. zinc. Boron, phosphorus,
      silicon and carbon lower melting point and rapidly diffuse to base
      metals. This allows diffusion brazing, and lets the joint be used above
      the brazing temperature. Borides and phosphides form brittle phases.
      Amorphous preforms can be made by rapid solidification.
    * Co
      Cobalt alloys. Good high-temperature corrosion resistance, possible
      alternative to Au-Pd brazes. Low workability at low temperatures,
      preforms prepared by rapid solidification.

Some additives and impurities act at very low levels. Both positive and
negative effects can be observed. Strontium at levels of 0.01% refines grain
structure of aluminium. Beryllium and bismuth at similar levels help disrupt
the passivation layer of aluminium oxide and promote wetting. Carbon at 0.1%
impairs corrosion resistance of nickel alloys. Aluminium can embrittle mild
steel at 0.001%, phosphorus at 0.01%.[23]
In some cases, especially for vacuum brazing, high-purity metals and alloys are
used. 99.99% and 99.999% purity levels are available commercially.
Care must be taken to not introduce deleterious impurities from joint
contamination or by dissolution of the base metals during brazing.
**** Melting behavior[edit] ****
Alloys with larger span of solidus/liquidus temperatures tend to melt through a
"mushy" state, during which the alloy is a mixture of solid and liquid
material. Some alloys show tendency to liquation, separation of the liquid from
the solid portion; for these the heating through the melting range must be
sufficiently fast to avoid this effect. Some alloys show extended plastic
range, when only a small portion of the alloy is liquid and most of the
material melts at the upper temperature range; these are suitable for bridging
large gaps and for forming fillets. Highly fluid alloys are suitable for
penetrating deep into narrow gaps and for brazing tight joints with narrow
tolerances but are not suitable for filling larger gaps. Alloys with wider
melting range are less sensitive to non-uniform clearances.
When the brazing temperature is suitably high, brazing and heat_treatment can
be done in a single operation simultaneously.
Eutectic alloys melt at single temperature, without mushy region. Eutectic
alloys have superior spreading; non-eutectics in the mushy region have high
viscosity and at the same time attack the base metal, with correspondingly
lower spreading force. Fine grain size gives eutectics both increased strength
and increased ductility. Highly accurate melting temperature lets joining
process be performed only slightly above the alloy's melting point. On
solidifying, there is no mushy state where the alloy appears solid but is not
yet; the chance of disturbing the joint by manipulation in such state is
reduced (assuming the alloy did not significantly change its properties by
dissolving the base metal). Eutectic behavior is especially beneficial for
solders.[23]
Metals with fine grain structure before melting provide superior wetting to
metals with large grains. Alloying additives (e.g. strontium to aluminium) can
be added to refine grain structure, and the preforms or foils can be prepared
by rapid quenching. Very rapid quenching may provide amorphous metal structure,
which possess further advantages.[23]
**** Interaction with base metals[edit] ****
Brazing at the Gary Tubular Steel Plant, 1943
For successful wetting, the base metal must be at least partially soluble in at
least one component of the brazing alloy. The molten alloy therefore tends to
attack the base metal and dissolve it, slightly changing its composition in the
process. The composition change is reflected in the change of the alloy's
melting point and the corresponding change of fluidity. For example, some
alloys dissolve both silver and copper; dissolved silver lowers their melting
point and increases fluidity, copper has the opposite effect.
The melting point change can be exploited. As the remelt temperature can be
increased by enriching the alloy with dissolved base metal, step brazing using
the same braze can be possible.
Alloys that do not significantly attack the base metals are more suitable for
brazing thin sections.
Nonhomogenous microstructure of the braze may cause non-uniform melting and
localized erosions of the base metal.
Wetting of base metals can be improved by adding a suitable metal to the alloy.
Tin facilitates wetting of iron, nickel, and many other alloys. Copper wets
ferrous metals that silver does not attack, copper-silver alloys can therefore
braze steels silver alone won't wet. Zinc improves wetting of ferrous metals,
indium as well. Aluminium improves wetting of aluminium alloys. For wetting of
ceramics, reactive metals capable of forming chemical compounds with the
ceramic (e.g. titanium, vanadium, zirconium...) can be added to the braze.
Dissolution of base metals can cause detrimental changes in the brazing alloy.
For example, aluminium dissolved from aluminium bronzes can embrittle the
braze; addition of nickel to the braze can offset this.
The effect works both ways; there can be detrimental interactions between the
braze alloy and the base metal. Presence of phosphorus in the braze alloy leads
to formation of brittle phosphides of iron and nickel, phosphorus-containing
alloys are therefore unsuitable for brazing nickel and ferrous alloys. Boron
tends to diffuse into the base metals, especially along the grain boundaries,
and may form brittle borides. Carbon can negatively influence some steels.
Care must be taken to avoid galvanic_corrosion between the braze and the base
metal, and especially between dissimilar base metals being brazed together.
Formation of brittle intermetallic compounds on the alloy interface can cause
joint failure. This is discussed more in-depth with solders.
The potentially detrimental phases may be distributed evenly through the volume
of the alloy, or be concentrated on the braze-base interface. A thick layer of
interfacial intermetallics is usually considered detrimental due to its
commonly low fracture toughness and other sub-par mechanical properties. In
some situations, e.g. die attaching, it however does not matter much as silicon
chips are not typically subjected to mechanical abuse.[23]
On wetting, brazes may liberate elements from the base metal. For example,
aluminium-silicon braze wets silicon nitride, dissociates the surface so it can
react with silicon, and liberates nitrogen, which may create voids along the
joint interface and lower its strength. Titanium-containing nickel-gold braze
wets silicon nitride and reacts with its surface, forming titanium nitride and
liberating silicon; silicon then forms brittle nickel_silicides and eutectic
gold-silicon phase; the resulting joint is weak and melts at much lower
temperature than may be expected.[23]
Metals may diffuse from one base alloy to the other one, causing embrittlement
or corrosion. An example is diffusion of aluminium from aluminium bronze to a
ferrous alloy when joining these. A diffusion barrier, e.g. a copper layer
(e.g. in a trimet strip), can be used.
A sacrificial layer of a noble metal can be used on the base metal as an oxygen
barrier, preventing formation of oxides and facilitating fluxless brazing.
During brazing, the noble metal layer dissolves in the filler metal. Copper or
nickel plating of stainless steels performs the same function.[23]
In brazing copper, a reducing atmosphere (or even a reducing flame) may react
with the oxygen residues in the metal, which are present as cuprous_oxide
inclusions, and cause hydrogen_embrittlement. The hydrogen present in the flame
or atmosphere at high temperature reacts with the oxide, yielding metallic
copper and water vapour, steam. The steam bubbles exert high pressure in the
metal structure, leading to cracks and joint porosity. Oxygen-free_copper is
not sensitive to this effect, however the most readily available grades, e.g.
electrolytic copper or high-conductivity copper, are. The embrittled joint may
then fail catastrophically without any previous sign of deformation or
deterioration.[27]
**** Preform[edit] ****
A brazing preform is a high quality, precision metal stamping used for a
variety of joining applications in manufacturing electronic devices and
systems. Typical brazing preform uses include attaching electronic circuitry,
packaging electronic devices, providing good thermal and electrical
conductivity, and providing an interface for electronic connections. Square,
rectangular and disc shaped brazing preforms are commonly used to attach
electronic components containing silicon_dies to a substrate such as a printed
circuit_board.
Rectangular frame shaped preforms are often required for the construction of
electronic packages while washer shaped brazing preforms are typically utilized
to attach lead_wires and hermetic feed-throughs to electronic circuits and
packages. Some preforms are also used in diodes, rectifiers, optoelectronic
devices and components packaging.[28]
â¢Difference between soldering and brazing
Soldering involves joining of materials with a filler metal that melts below
~450Â°C. It generally requires a relatively fine and uniform surface finish
between the faying surfaces. The solder joints tend to be weaker due to the
lower strength of the solder materials.
Brazing utilizes filler materials with a melting temperature above ~450Â°C.
Surface finish tends to be less critical and the braze joints tend to be
stronger.
