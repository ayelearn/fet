Figure 1. The light path through a Michelson_interferometer. The two light rays
with a common source combine at the half-silvered mirror to reach the detector.
They may either interfere constructively (strengthening in intensity) if their
light waves arrive in phase, or interfere destructively (weakening in
intensity) if they arrive out of phase, depending on the exact distances
between the three mirrors.
Interferometry is a family of techniques in which waves, usually
electromagnetic_waves, are superimposed, causing the phenomenon of
interference, which is used to extract information.[1] Interferometry is an
important investigative technique in the fields of astronomy, fiber_optics,
engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology,
spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum_mechanics, nuclear
and particle_physics, plasma_physics, remote_sensing, biomolecular
interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain
measurement, velocimetry, and optometry.[2]:1â2
Interferometers are widely used in science and industry for the measurement of
small displacements, refractive_index changes and surface irregularities. In
most interferometers, light from a single source is split into two beams that
travel in different optical_paths, which are then combined again to produce
interference; however, under some circumstances, two incoherent sources can
also be made to interfere[3]. The resulting interference_fringes give
information about the difference in optical_path_lengths. In analytical
science, interferometers are used to measure lengths and the shape of optical
components with nanometer precision; they are the highest precision length
measuring instruments existing. In Fourier_transform_spectroscopy they are used
to analyze light containing features of absorption or emission associated with
a substance or mixture. An astronomical_interferometer consists of two or more
separate telescopes that combine their signals, offering a resolution
equivalent to that of a telescope of diameter equal to the largest separation
between its individual elements.

Interferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in
a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful
property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works
because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity
pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two wavesâwaves
that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are
out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not
completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate
intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase
difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of
electromagnetic_wave.[2]:3â12
Typically (see Fig. 1, the well-known Michelson configuration) a single
incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a
beam_splitter (a partially reflecting mirror). Each of these beams travels a
different route, called a path, and they are recombined before arriving at a
detector. The path difference, the difference in the distance traveled by each
beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase
difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially
identical waves.[2]:14â17 If a single beam has been split along two paths,
then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase
along the paths. This could be a physical change in the path_length itself or a
change in the refractive_index along the path.[2]:93â103
As seen in Fig. 2a and 2b, the observer has a direct view of mirror M1 seen
through the beam splitter, and sees a reflected image M′2 of mirror M2. The
fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming
from the two virtual images S′1 and S′2 of the original source S. The
characteristics of the interference pattern depend on the nature of the light
source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter. In
Fig. 2a, the optical elements are oriented so that S′1 and S′2 are in line with
the observer, and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles
centered on the normal to M1 and M'2. If, as in Fig. 2b, M1 and M′2 are tilted
with respect to each other, the interference fringes will generally take the
shape of conic sections (hyperbolas), but if M′1 and M′2 overlap, the fringes
near the axis will be straight, parallel, and equally spaced. If S is an
extended source rather than a point source as illustrated, the fringes of
Fig. 2a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity, while the fringes of
Fig. 2b will be localized on the mirrors.[2]:17
Use of white light will result in a pattern of colored fringes (see Fig. 3).
[2]:26 The central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark
depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as
they traverse the optical system.[2]:26,171â172 (See Michelson_interferometer
for a discussion of this.)
***** Categories[edit] *****
Interferometers and interferometric techniques may be categorized by a variety
of criteria:
**** Homodyne versus heterodyne detection[edit] ****
In homodyne_detection, the interference occurs between two beams at the same
wavelength (or carrier_frequency). The phase difference between the two beams
results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector. The
resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured,
or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded.[4] Most of the
interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.
The heterodyne technique is used for (1) shifting an input signal into a new
frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of
an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong
reference frequency f2 from a local_oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination
of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1 + f2 of the two
frequencies, and the other at the difference f1 â f2. These new frequencies
are called heterodynes. Typically only one of the new frequencies is desired,
and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output
signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of
the input signals.[4]
The most important and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is
in the superheterodyne_receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin
Howard_Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio_frequency signal
from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and
converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called
the intermediate_frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before
being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which is sent to
the loudspeaker.[5]
      Optical_heterodyne_detection is an extension of the heterodyne technique
      to higher (visible) frequencies.[4]
While optical heterodyne interferometry is usually done at a single point it is
also possible to perform this widefield[6].
**** Double path versus common path[edit] ****
See also: Common-path_interferometer
Figure 4. Four examples of common-path interferometers
A double path interferometer is one in which the reference beam and sample beam
travel along divergent paths. Examples include the Michelson_interferometer,
the TwymanâGreen_interferometer, and the MachâZehnder_interferometer. After
being perturbed by interaction with the sample under test, the sample beam is
recombined with the reference beam to create an interference pattern which can
then be interpreted.[2]:13â22
A common-path_interferometer is a class of interferometer in which the
reference beam and sample beam travel along the same path. Fig. 4 illustrates
the Sagnac_interferometer, the fibre_optic_gyroscope, the point_diffraction
interferometer, and the lateral_shearing_interferometer. Other examples of
common path interferometer include the Zernike_phase-contrast_microscope,
Fresnel's_biprism, the zero-area_Sagnac, and the scatterplate_interferometer.
[7]
**** Wavefront splitting versus amplitude splitting[edit] ****
A wavefront splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront emerging from a
point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the
two parts of the wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to
recombine.[8] Fig. 5 illustrates Young's_interference_experiment and Lloyd's
mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the
Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh_interferometer.[9]
Figure 5. Two wavefront splitting interferometers
In 1803, Young's_interference_experiment played a major role in the general
acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white light is used in Young's
experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive_interference
corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a
symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to
continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed
with individual photons,[10] with electrons,[11][12] and with buckyball
molecules large enough to be seen under an electron_microscope.[13]
Lloyd's_mirror generates interference fringes by combining direct light from a
source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines)
from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern
of fringes. The band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather
than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the
phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.[14][15]
An amplitude splitting interferometer uses a partial reflector to divide the
amplitude of the incident wave into separate beams which are separated and
recombined. Fig. 6 illustrates the Fizeau, MachâZehnder and FabryâPÃ©rot
interferometers. Other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include
the Michelson, TwymanâGreen, Laser Unequal Path, and Linnik_interferometer.
[16]
Figure 6. Three amplitude-splitting interferometers: Fizeau, MachâZehnder,
and Fabry PÃ©rot
The Fizeau interferometer is shown as it might be set up to test an optical
flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being
tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled
(only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear
surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test
and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each
other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the
fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so
that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes
rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however,
necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig 6 shows a
collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam
splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.[17][18]
The MachâZehnder interferometer is a more versatile instrument than the
Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed
only once, and the fringes can be adjusted so that they are localized in any
desired plane.[2]:18 Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the
same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be
photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light,
then, since white light has a limited coherence_length, on the order of
micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no
fringes will be visible. As illustrated in Fig. 6, a compensating cell would be
placed in the path of the reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the
precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam
splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through
an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams
each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of
phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path
length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of
constructive interference.[19][20]
The heart of the FabryâPÃ©rot interferometer is a pair of partially silvered
glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the
silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a FabryâPÃ©rot etalon
uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.)[2]:35â36 As
with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical
system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal_plane of
a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of
the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. in the absence of the
paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system
would be focused at point A'. In Fig. 6, only one ray emitted from point A on
the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is
multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by
the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete
interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The
sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the
reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q_factor (i.e. high finesse),
monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark
background.[21] In Fig. 6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity
of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-
finesse image.
Michelson and Morley (1887)[22] and other early experimentalists using
interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the
luminiferous_aether, used monochromatic light only for initially setting up
their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements.
The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Monochromatic light
would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental
temperature_control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift
even though the interferometer might be set up in a basement. Since the fringes
would occasionally disappear due to vibrations by passing horse traffic,
distant thunderstorms and the like, it would be easy for an observer to "get
lost" when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light,
which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the
difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence_length.[23]
This was an early example of the use of white light to resolve the "2 pi
ambiguity".
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Physics and astronomy[edit] ****
In physics, one of the most important experiments of the late 19th century was
the famous "failed experiment" of Michelson_and_Morley which provided evidence
for special_relativity. Recent repetitions of the MichelsonâMorley experiment
perform heterodyne measurements of beat frequencies of crossed cryogenic
optical_resonators. Fig 7 illustrates a resonator experiment performed by
MÃ¼ller et al. in 2003.[24] Two optical resonators constructed from crystalline
sapphire, controlling the frequencies of two lasers, were set at right angles
within a helium cryostat. A frequency comparator measured the beat frequency of
the combined outputs of the two resonators. As of 2009[update], the precision
by which anisotropy of the speed of light can be excluded in resonator
experiments is at the 10â17 level.[25][26]

Michelson interferometers are used in tunable narrow band optical filters[27]
and as the core hardware component of Fourier_transform_spectrometers.[28]
When used as a tunable narrow band filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a
number of advantages and disadvantages when compared with competing
technologies such as FabryâPÃ©rot_interferometers or Lyot_filters. Michelson
interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and
are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of
waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or
lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a FabryâPÃ©rot system. Compared
with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers
have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson
interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use
of prefilters which restrict transmittance.[29]
Fig. 8 illustrates the operation of a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is
essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical
Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the
flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity,
the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making
measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A
Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.[30]
Fig. 9 shows a doppler image of the solar corona made using a tunable Fabry-
PÃ©rot interferometer to recover scans of the solar corona at a number of
wavelengths near the FeXIV green line. The picture is a color-coded image of
the doppler shift of the line, which may be associated with the coronal plasma
velocity towards or away from the satellite camera.
FabryâPÃ©rot thin-film etalons are used in narrow bandpass filters capable of
selecting a single spectral line for imaging; for example, the H-alpha line or
the Ca-K line of the Sun or stars. Fig. 10 shows an Extreme_ultraviolet_Imaging
Telescope (EIT) image of the Sun at 195 ÃngstrÃ¶ms, corresponding to a
spectral line of multiply-ionized iron atoms.[31] EIT used multilayer coated
reflective mirrors that were coated with alternate layers of a light "spacer"
element (such as silicon), and a heavy "scatterer" element (such as
molybdenum). Approximately 100 layers of each type were placed on each mirror,
with a thickness of around 10 nm each. The layer thicknesses were tightly
controlled so that at the desired wavelength, reflected photons from each layer
interfered constructively.
The Laser_Interferometer_Gravitational-Wave_Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km
MichelsonâFabryâPÃ©rot_interferometers for the detection of gravitational
waves.[32] In this application, the FabryâPÃ©rot cavity is used to store
photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the
mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the
light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller
cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and
frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first_observation_of
gravitational_waves occurred on September 14, 2015.[33]
The MachâZehnder interferometer's relatively large and freely accessible
working space, and its flexibility in locating the fringes has made it the
interferometer of choice for visualizing_flow in wind tunnels,[34][35] and for
flow visualization studies in general. It is frequently used in the fields of
aerodynamics, plasma physics and heat transfer to measure pressure, density,
and temperature changes in gases.[2]:18,93â95
MachâZehnder interferometers are also used to study one of the most
counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics, the phenomenon known as
quantum_entanglement.[36][37]
Figure 11. The VLA interferometer
An astronomical interferometer achieves high-resolution observations using the
technique of aperture_synthesis, mixing signals from a cluster of comparatively
small telescopes rather than a single very expensive monolithic telescope.[38]
Early radio_telescope interferometers used a single baseline for measurement.
Later astronomical interferometers, such as the Very_Large_Array illustrated in
Fig 11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A
limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was
alleviated by using the rotation of the Earth to rotate the array relative to
the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple
orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation
synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very_long
baseline_interferometry.[38]
ALMA is an astronomical interferometer located in Chajnantor_Plateau[39]
Astronomical_optical_interferometry has had to overcome a number of technical
issues not shared by radio telescope interferometry. The short wavelengths of
light necessitate extreme precision and stability of construction. For example,
spatial resolution of 1 milliarcsecond requires 0.5 Âµm stability in a 100 m
baseline. Optical interferometric measurements require high sensitivity, low
noise detectors that did not become available until the late 1990s.
Astronomical_"seeing", the turbulence that causes stars to twinkle, introduces
rapid, random phase changes in the incoming light, requiring kilohertz data
collection rates to be faster than the rate of turbulence.[40][41] Despite
these technical difficulties, roughly_a_dozen_astronomical_optical
interferometers are now in operation offering resolutions down to the
fractional milliarcsecond range. This_linked_video_shows_a_movie_assembled_from
aperture_synthesis_images_of_the_Beta_Lyrae_system, a binary star system
approximately 960 light-years (290 parsecs) away in the constellation Lyra, as
observed by the CHARA_array with the MIRC instrument. The brighter component is
the primary star, or the mass donor. The fainter component is the thick disk
surrounding the secondary star, or the mass gainer. The two components are
separated by 1 milli-arcsecond. Tidal distortions of the mass donor and the
mass gainer are both clearly visible.[42]
The wave_character_of_matter can be exploited to build interferometers. The
first examples of matter interferometers were electron_interferometers, later
followed by neutron_interferometers. Around 1990 the first atom_interferometers
were demonstrated, later followed by interferometers employing molecules.[43]
[44][45]
Electron_holography is an imaging technique that photographically records the
electron interference pattern of an object, which is then reconstructed to
yield a greatly magnified image of the original object.[46] This technique was
developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible
using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron
microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations
of electron lenses.[47]
Neutron interferometry has been used to investigate the AharonovâBohm_effect,
to examine the effects of gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to
demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli
exclusion_principle: Unlike macroscopic objects, when fermions are rotated by
360Â° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a
minus sign in their wave function. In other words, a fermion needs to be
rotated 720Â° before returning to its original state.[48]
Atom interferometry techniques are reaching sufficient precision to allow
laboratory-scale tests of general_relativity.[49]
Interferometers are used in atmospheric physics for high-precision measurements
of trace gases via remote sounding of the atmosphere. There are several
examples of interferometers that utilize either absorption or emission features
of trace gases. A typical use would be in continual monitoring of the column
concentration of trace gases such as ozone and carbon monoxide above the
instrument.[50]
**** Engineering and applied science[edit] ****
Figure 13. Optical flat interference fringes. (left) flat surface, (right)
curved surface.
How interference fringes are formed by an optical flat resting on a reflective
surface. The gap between the surfaces and the wavelength of the light waves are
greatly exaggerated.
Newton (test plate) interferometry is frequently used in the optical industry
for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured.
Fig. 13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats at
different stages of completion, showing the different patterns of interference
fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact
with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source.
The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern
of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat,
indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal
intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of
curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in
surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in
elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces
can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether
the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference
optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the
fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes
the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with
experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance
of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing
position.[51] These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are
not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for
sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal
testing and certification.
Fabry-PÃ©rot etalons are widely used in telecommunications, lasers and
spectroscopy to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic_filters
are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-
division_multiplexing, the technology that enables the use of multiple
wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering
devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to
suppress all optical_cavity modes except the single one of interest.[2]:42
Figure 14. TwymanâGreen Interferometer
The TwymanâGreen interferometer, invented by Twyman and Green in 1916, is a
variant of the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components.
[52] The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson
configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a
collimator. Michelson (1918) criticized the TwymanâGreen configuration as
being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light
sources available at the time had limited coherence_length. Michelson pointed
out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required
the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the
TwymanâGreen impractical for many purposes.[53] Decades later, the advent of
laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twymanâreen
interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a
Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig. 14 illustrates a
TwymanâGreen interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic
point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated
into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its
center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The
emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.[54]
MachâZehnder interferometers are being used in integrated_optical_circuits,
in which light interferes between two branches of a waveguide that are
externally modulated to vary their relative phase. A slight tilt of one of the
beam splitters will result in a path difference and a change in the
interference pattern. MachâZehnder interferometers are the basis of a wide
variety of devices, from RF_modulators to sensors[55][56] to optical_switches.
[57]
The latest proposed extremely_large_astronomical_telescopes, such as the Thirty
Meter_Telescope and the Extremely_Large_Telescope, will be of segmented design.
Their primary mirrors will be built from hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments.
Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric
mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical
testing compares a surface against a spherical reference with the aid of a null
corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to
supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces.
Fig. 15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line
spacing on the order of 1 to 10 Âµm. When laser light is passed through the
CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The
wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the
desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer
test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical
reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the
test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form
interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors
as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.[58]
Figure 15. Optical testing with a Fizeau interferometer and a computer
generated hologram
Ring_laser_gyroscopes (RLGs) and fibre_optic_gyroscopes (FOGs) are
interferometers used in navigation systems. They operate on the principle of
the Sagnac_effect. The distinction between RLGs and FOGs is that in a RLG, the
entire ring is part of the laser while in a FOG, an external laser injects
counter-propagating beams into an optical_fiber ring, and rotation of the
system then causes a relative phase shift between those beams. In a RLG, the
observed phase shift is proportional to the accumulated rotation, while in a
FOG, the observed phase shift is proportional to the angular velocity.[59]
In telecommunication networks, heterodyning is used to move frequencies of
individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical
transmission line. This is called frequency_division_multiplexing (FDM). For
example, a coaxial_cable used by a cable_television system can carry 500
television channels at the same time because each one is given a different
frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW)
doppler_radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare
transmitted and reflected beams.[60]
Optical heterodyne detection is used for coherent Doppler_lidar measurements
capable of detecting very weak light scattered in the atmosphere and monitoring
wind speeds with high accuracy. It has application in optical_fiber
communications, in various high resolution spectroscopic techniques, and the
self-heterodyne method can be used to measure the linewidth of a laser.[4][61]
Figure 16. Frequency comb of a mode-locked laser. The dashed lines represent an
extrapolation of the mode frequencies towards the frequency of the
carrierâenvelope offset (CEO). The vertical grey line represents an unknown
optical frequency. The horizontal black lines indicate the two lowest beat
frequency measurements.
Optical heterodyne detection is an essential technique used in high-accuracy
measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, as well as in the
stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy
frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium_or
other_atomic_time_source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a
frequency_multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of
that step, which would be compared by heterodyne detection with the next step
(the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or
visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several
years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently,
optical frequency_combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring
optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of
pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by
a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to
the pulse repetition frequency (Fig. 16). The pulse repetition frequency is
locked to that of the frequency_standard, and the frequencies of the comb
elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the
frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing
the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the
frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step.
To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a
spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral
segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is
measured.[62][63]
One of the most common industrial applications of optical interferometry is as
a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface
topography. Popular interferometric measurement techniques include Phase
Shifting Interferometry (PSI),[64] and Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI),
[65] also known as scanning white_light_interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO
term Coherence_Scanning_Interferometry (CSI),[66] CSI exploits coherence to
extend the range of capabilities for interference microscopy.[67][68] These
techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI
uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is
only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and
high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes,
as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other
feature of the overall fringe pattern. In its simplest form, CSI provides less
precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some
configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution
SWLI or Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), use coherence effects in combination
with interference phase to enhance precision.[69][70]
Figure 17. Phase shifting and Coherence scanning interferometers
Phase Shifting Interferometry addresses several issues associated with the
classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures the
positions of the fringe centers. As seen in Fig. 13, fringe deviations from
straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in
determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to
precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the
interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision
and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of
low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high
precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the
classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be
obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram
is thrown away.[71][72] Finally, with static interferograms, additional
information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig. 13,
one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but
one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is
concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-
automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when
the reference surface is pushed.[73]
Phase shifting interferometry overcomes these limitations by not relying on
finding fringe centers, but rather by collecting intensity data from every
point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig. 17, multiple interferograms (at
least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a
precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric
transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by
modulating the laser frequency.[74] The captured images are processed by a
computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and
reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram
analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being
routine.[71][72] Phase shifting technology has been adapted to a variety of
interferometer types such as TwymanâGreen, MachâZehnder, laser Fizeau, and
even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing
interferometers.[73][75] More generally, phase shifting techniques can be
adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as
holographic and speckle interferometry.[73]

Light Interferometry (SWLI)

In coherence_scanning_interferometry,[76] interference is only achieved when
the path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence
time of the light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the
phase of the fringes.[2]:105 Fig. 17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau
interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white
light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives,
where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt too much of the
aperture) and the Linnik_interferometer (for high magnification objectives with
limited working distance).[77] The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is
moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of
maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel.[67][78] The chief benefit of
coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not
suffer from the 2 pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry,[79][80][81] and as
seen in Fig. 18, which scans a 180Î¼m x 140Î¼m x 10Î¼m volume, it is well
suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the
system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source.[82]
[83] Industrial applications include in-process surface_metrology, roughness
measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile
environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features
(grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and
optical industries, etc.).[84][85]
Fig. 19 illustrates a TwymanâGreen_interferometer set up for white light
scanning of a macroscopic object.
Holographic_interferometry is a technique which uses holography to monitor
small deformations in single wavelength implementations. In multi-wavelength
implementations, it is used to perform dimensional metrology of large parts and
assemblies and to detect larger surface defects.[2]:111â120
Holographic interferometry was discovered by accident as a result of mistakes
committed during the making of holograms. Early lasers were relatively weak and
photographic plates were insensitive, necessitating long exposures during which
vibrations or minute shifts might occur in the optical system. The resultant
holograms, which showed the holographic subject covered with fringes, were
considered ruined.[86]
Eventually, several independent groups of experimenters in the mid-60s realized
that the fringes encoded important information about dimensional changes
occurring in the subject, and began intentionally producing holographic double
exposures. The main Holographic_interferometry article covers the disputes over
priority of discovery that occurred during the issuance of the patent for this
method.[87]
Double- and multi- exposure holography is one of three methods used to create
holographic interferograms. A first exposure records the object in an
unstressed state. Subsequent exposures on the same photographic plate are made
while the object is subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the
difference between the stressed and unstressed states.[88]
Real-time holography is a second method of creating holographic interferograms.
A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated
with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly
superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being
subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will
interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real
time monitoring of shape changes.[88]
The third method, time-average holography, involves creating a holograph while
the object is subjected to a periodic stress or vibration. This yields a visual
image of the vibration pattern.[88]

Interferometric_synthetic_aperture_radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in
geodesy and remote_sensing. Satellite synthetic_aperture_radar images of a
geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes that have taken
place between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes
similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can
monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes,
volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in
particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig 20
shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space
shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and
October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were
overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.[89]
Electronic_speckle_pattern_interferometry (ESPI), also known as TV holography,
uses video detection and recording to produce an image of the object upon which
is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of the
object between recordings. (see Fig. 21) The fringes are similar to those
obtained in holographic interferometry.[2]:111â120[90]
When lasers were first invented, laser_speckle was considered to be a severe
drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic
imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that
speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface
deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern
interferometry in 1970,[91] and since then, speckle has been exploited in a
variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern
before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern
after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a
correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal
deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture
very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other
information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a
peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase
ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.[92][93]
A method of establishing precise geodetic baselines, invented by YrjÃ¶
VÃ¤isÃ¤lÃ¤, exploited the low coherence length of white light. Initially, white
light was split in two, with the reference beam "folded", bouncing back-and-
forth six times between a mirror pair spaced precisely 1 m apart. Only if the
test path was precisely 6 times the reference path would fringes be seen.
Repeated applications of this procedure allowed precise measurement of
distances up to 864 meters. Baselines thus established were used to calibrate
geodetic distance measurement equipment, leading to a metrologically traceable
scale for geodetic_networks measured by these instruments.[94] (This method has
been superseded by GPS.)
Other uses of interferometers have been to study dispersion of materials,
measurement of complex indices of refraction, and thermal properties. They are
also used for three-dimensional motion mapping including mapping vibrational
patterns of structures.[69]
**** Biology and medicine[edit] ****
Optical interferometry, applied to biology and medicine, provides sensitive
metrology capabilities for the measurement of biomolecules, subcellular
components, cells and tissues.[95] Many forms of label-free biosensors rely on
interferometry because the direct interaction of electromagnetic fields with
local molecular polarizability eliminates the need for fluorescent tags or
nanoparticle markers. At a larger scale, cellular interferometry shares aspects
with phase-contrast microscopy, but comprises a much larger class of phase-
sensitive optical configurations that rely on optical interference among
cellular constituents through refraction and diffraction. At the tissue scale,
partially-coherent forward-scattered light propagation through the micro
aberrations and heterogeneity of tissue structure provides opportunities to use
phase-sensitive gating (optical coherence tomography) as well as phase-
sensitive fluctuation spectroscopy to image subtle structural and dynamical
properties.

Optical_coherence_tomography (OCT) is a medical imaging technique using low-
coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal
tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig. 22, the core of a typical OCT system is
a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue
sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other
interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the
tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of
the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only
over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical
slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the
reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the
tissue can be reconstructed.[96][97] Recent advances have striven to combine
the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging
capability of low-coherence interferometry.[69]

Phase_contrast and differential_interference_contrast (DIC) microscopy are
important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled
organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost
totally invisible under simple bright_field_illumination. These structures can
be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-
consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs. 24 and 25, phase contrast and
DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied.[98] DIC also has
non-biological applications, for example in the analysis_of_planar_silicon
semiconductor_processing.
Angle-resolved_low-coherence_interferometry (a/LCI) uses scattered light to
measure the sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows
interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements.
Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the
measurements of subcellular objects. For example, it has been found that as
tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size
increases.[99][100]
Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig. 26) refers to a variety of techniques that
use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an
elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast_x-ray_imaging_(introduction). For a
more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast_X-ray_imaging.) It has become an
important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures in a wide
range of biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being
used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to
convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity
variations.[101][102] These include propagation-based phase contrast,[103]
talbot interferometry,[102] moirÃ©-based far-field interferometry,[104]
refraction-enhanced imaging,[105] and x-ray interferometry.[106] These methods
provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging,
making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods
require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray
sources, x-ray_optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.
