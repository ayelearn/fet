A phase diagram in physical_chemistry, engineering, mineralogy, and materials
science is a type of chart used to show conditions (pressure, temperature,
volume, etc.) at which thermodynamically distinct phases (such as solid, liquid
or gaseous states) occur and coexist at equilibrium.

***** Overview[edit] *****
Common components of a phase diagram are lines of equilibrium or phase
boundaries, which refer to lines that mark conditions under which multiple
phases can coexist at equilibrium. Phase transitions occur along lines of
equilibrium.
Triple_points are points on phase diagrams where lines of equilibrium
intersect. Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can
coexist. For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding
to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous
water can coexist in a stable equilibrium (273.16 K and a partial vapor
pressure of 611.657 Pa).
The solidus is the temperature below which the substance is stable in the solid
state. The liquidus is the temperature above which the substance is stable in a
liquid state. There may be a gap between the solidus and liquidus; within the
gap, the substance consists of a mixture of crystals and liquid (like a
"slurry").[1]
Working_fluids are often categorized on the basis of the shape of their phase
diagram.
***** Types[edit] *****
**** 2-dimensional diagrams[edit] ****
A typical phase diagram. The solid green line applies to most substances; the
dotted green line gives the_anomalous_behavior_of_water. The green lines mark
the freezing_point and the blue line the boiling_point, showing how they vary
with pressure.
The simplest phase diagrams are pressureâtemperature diagrams of a single
simple substance, such as water. The axes correspond to the pressure and
temperature. The phase diagram shows, in pressureâtemperature space, the
lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid,
liquid, and gas.
The curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and
other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect
to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change
discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container
filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the
melting point. The open spaces, where the free_energy is analytic, correspond
to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-
analytical behavior, where phase_transitions occur, which are called phase
boundaries.
In the diagram on the right, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not
continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram
called the critical_point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high
temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become
indistinguishable,[2] in what is known as a supercritical_fluid. In water, the
critical point occurs at around Tc = 647.096 K (373.946 Â°C), pc = 22.064 MPa
(217.75 atm) and Ïc = 356 kg/m3.[3]
The existence of the liquidâgas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in
labelling the single phase regions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous
phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a
path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical
point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each
other. The solidâliquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if
the solid and liquid phases have the same symmetry_group.[citation_needed]
For most substances, the solidâliquid phase boundary (or fusion curve) in the
phase diagram has a positive slope so that the melting point increases with
pressure. This is true whenever the solid phase is denser than the liquid
phase.[4] The greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together
the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the
effect of the substance's intermolecular_forces. Thus, the substance requires a
higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out of the
fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept
applies to liquidâgas phase changes.[5]
Water is an exception which has a solid-liquid boundary with negative slope so
that the melting point decreases with pressure. This occurs because ice (solid
water) is less dense than liquid water, as shown by the fact that ice floats on
water. At a molecular level, ice is less dense because it has a more extensive
network of hydrogen_bonding which requires a greater separation of water
molecules.[4] Other exceptions are antimony and bismuth.[6][7]
The value of the slope dP/dT is given by the Clapeyron_equation for fusion
(melting)[8]
             d  P    d  T    =     &#x0394;  fus   H   T   &#x0394;  fus   V
      ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {\Delta
      _{\text{fus}}H}{T\,\Delta _{\text{fus}}V}},}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {\Delta _{\text{fus}}H}{T\,\Delta
      _{\text{fus}}V}},}]
where ÎHfus is the heat of fusion which is always positive, and ÎVfus is the
volume change for fusion. For most substances ÎVfus is positive so that the
slope is positive. However for water and other exceptions, ÎVfus is negative
so that the slope is negative.
*** Other thermodynamic properties[edit] ***
In addition to temperature and pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be
graphed in phase diagrams. Examples of such thermodynamic properties include
specific_volume, specific_enthalpy, or specific entropy. For example, single-
component graphs of temperature vs. specific entropy (T vs. s) for water/steam
or for a refrigerant are commonly used to illustrate thermodynamic_cycles such
as a Carnot_cycle, Rankine_cycle, or vapor-compression_refrigeration cycle.
Any two thermodynamic quantities may be shown on the horizontal and vertical
axes of a two-dimensional diagram. Additional thermodynamic quantities may each
be illustrated in increments as a series of lines â curved, straight, or a
combination of curved and straight. Each of these iso-lines represents the
thermodynamic quantity at a certain constant value.

under the red dome, liquid water and steam coexist in equilibrium. The critical
point is at the top of the dome. Liquid water is to the left of the dome. Steam
is to the right of the dome. The blue lines/curves are isobars showing constant
pressure. The green lines/curves are isochors showing constant specific volume.
The red curves show constant quality.

**** 3-dimensional diagrams[edit] ****
pâvâT 3D diagram for fixed amount of pure material
It is possible to envision three-dimensional (3D) graphs showing three
thermodynamic quantities.[9][10] For example, for a single component, a 3D
Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (T) on one axis, pressure
(p) on a second axis, and specific volume (v) on a third. Such a 3D graph is
sometimes called a pâvâT diagram. The equilibrium conditions are shown as
curves on a curved surface in 3D with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases
and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist
in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a triple line is where solid,
liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a
point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram.
For water, the 3D pâvâT diagram is seen here:[11]

An orthographic_projection of the 3D pâvâT graph showing pressure and
temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes collapses the 3D plot into the
standard 2D pressureâtemperature diagram. When this is done, the
solidâvapor, solidâliquid, and liquidâvapor surfaces collapse into three
corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed
orthographic projection of the triple line.
**** Binary mixtures[edit] ****
Other much more complex types of phase diagrams can be constructed,
particularly when more than one pure component is present. In that case,
concentration becomes an important variable. Phase diagrams with more than two
dimensions can be constructed that show the effect of more than two variables
on the phase of a substance. Phase diagrams can use other variables in addition
to or in place of temperature, pressure and composition, for example the
strength of an applied electrical or magnetic field, and they can also involve
substances that take on more than just three states of matter.
The ironâiron carbide (FeâFe3C) phase diagram. The percentage of carbon
present and the temperature define the phase of the iron carbon alloy and
therefore its physical characteristics and mechanical properties. The
percentage of carbon determines the type of the ferrous alloy: iron, steel or
cast iron
A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.
One type of phase diagram plots temperature against the relative concentrations
of two substances in a binary mixture called a binary phase diagram, as shown
at right. Such a mixture can be either a solid_solution, eutectic or
peritectic, among others. These two types of mixtures result in very different
graphs. Another type of binary phase diagram is a boiling-point diagram for a
mixture of two components, i. e. chemical_compounds. For two particular
volatile components at a certain pressure such as atmospheric_pressure, a
boiling-point diagram shows what vapor (gas) compositions are in equilibrium
with given liquid compositions depending on temperature. In a typical binary
boiling-point diagram, temperature is plotted on a vertical axis and mixture
composition on a horizontal axis.
Boiling-point diagram
A simple example diagram with hypothetical components 1 and 2 in a non-
azeotropic mixture is shown at right. The fact that there are two separate
curved lines joining the boiling points of the pure components means that the
vapor composition is usually not the same as the liquid composition the vapor
is in equilibrium with. See Vaporâliquid_equilibrium for more information.
In addition to the above-mentioned types of phase diagrams, there are thousands
of other possible combinations. Some of the major features of phase diagrams
include congruent points, where a solid phase transforms directly into a
liquid. There is also the peritectoid, a point where two solid phases combine
into one solid phase during cooling. The inverse of this, when one solid phase
transforms into two solid phases during cooling, is called the eutectoid.
A complex phase diagram of great technological importance is that of the
ironâcarbon system for less than 7% carbon (see steel).
The x-axis of such a diagram represents the concentration variable of the
mixture. As the mixtures are typically far from dilute and their density as a
function of temperature is usually unknown, the preferred concentration measure
is mole_fraction. A volume-based measure like molarity would be inadvisable.
**** Crystals[edit] ****
Polymorphic and polyamorphic substances have multiple crystal or amorphous
phases, which can be graphed in a similar fashion to solid, liquid, and gas
phases.

**** Mesophases[edit] ****
Some organic materials pass through intermediate states between solid and
liquid; these states are called mesophases. Attention has been directed to
mesophases because they enable display_devices and have become commercially
important through the so-called liquid-crystal technology. Phase diagrams are
used to describe the occurrence of mesophases.[13]
