Strength of materials, also called mechanics of materials, is a subject which
deals with the behavior of solid objects subject to stresses and strains. The
complete theory began with the consideration of the behavior of one and two
dimensional members of structures, whose states of stress can be approximated
as two dimensional, and was then generalized to three dimensions to develop a
more complete theory of the elastic and plastic behavior of materials. An
important founding pioneer in mechanics of materials was Stephen_Timoshenko.
The study of strength of materials often refers to various methods of
calculating the stresses and strains in structural members, such as beams,
columns, and shafts. The methods employed to predict the response of a
structure under loading and its susceptibility to various failure modes takes
into account the properties of the materials such as its yield_strength,
ultimate_strength, Young's_modulus, and Poisson's_ratio; in addition the
mechanical element's macroscopic properties (geometric properties), such as its
length, width, thickness, boundary constraints and abrupt changes in geometry
such as holes are considered.

***** Definition[edit] *****
In mechanics of materials, the strength of a material is its ability to
withstand an applied load without failure or plastic_deformation. The field of
strength of materials deals with forces and deformations that result from their
acting on a material. A load applied to a mechanical member will induce
internal forces within the member called stresses when those forces are
expressed on a unit basis. The stresses acting on the material cause
deformation of the material in various manners including breaking them
completely. Deformation of the material is called strain when those
deformations too are placed on a unit basis. The applied loads may be axial
(tensile or compressive), or rotational (strength shear). The stresses and
strains that develop within a mechanical member must be calculated in order to
assess the load capacity of that member. This requires a complete description
of the geometry of the member, its constraints, the loads applied to the member
and the properties of the material of which the member is composed. With a
complete description of the loading and the geometry of the member, the state
of stress and state of strain at any point within the member can be calculated.
Once the state of stress and strain within the member is known, the strength
(load carrying capacity) of that member, its deformations (stiffness
qualities), and its stability (ability to maintain its original configuration)
can be calculated. The calculated stresses may then be compared to some measure
of the strength of the member such as its material yield or ultimate strength.
The calculated deflection of the member may be compared to a deflection
criteria that is based on the member's use. The calculated buckling load of the
member may be compared to the applied load. The calculated stiffness and mass
distribution of the member may be used to calculate the member's dynamic
response and then compared to the acoustic environment in which it will be
used.
Material strength refers to the point on the engineering stressâstrain_curve
(yield stress) beyond which the material experiences deformations that will not
be completely reversed upon removal of the loading and as a result the member
will have a permanent deflection. The ultimate strength of the material refers
to the maximum value of stress reached. The fracture strength is the stress
value at fracture (the last stress value recorded).
**** Types of loadings[edit] ****
    * Transverse loadings — Forces applied perpendicular to the longitudinal
      axis of a member. Transverse loading causes the member to bend and
      deflect from its original position, with internal tensile and compressive
      strains accompanying the change in curvature of the member.[1] Transverse
      loading also induces shear forces that cause shear deformation of the
      material and increase the transverse deflection of the member.
    * Axial loading — The applied forces are collinear with the longitudinal
      axis of the member. The forces cause the member to either stretch or
      shorten.[2]
    * Torsional loading — Twisting action caused by a pair of externally
      applied equal and oppositely directed force couples acting on parallel
      planes or by a single external couple applied to a member that has one
      end fixed against rotation.
**** Stress terms[edit] ****
A material being loaded in a) compression, b) tension, c) shear.
Uniaxial stress is expressed by
         &#x03C3; =   F A     {\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {F}{A}}}  [\sigma =
      {\frac  {F}{A}}]
where F is the force [N] acting on an area A [m2].[3] The area can be the
undeformed area or the deformed area, depending on whether engineering_stress
or true stress is of interest.
    * Compressive_stress (or compression) is the stress state caused by an
      applied load that acts to reduce the length of the material (compression
      member) along the axis of the applied load, it is in other words a stress
      state that causes a squeezing of the material. A simple case of
      compression is the uniaxial compression induced by the action of
      opposite, pushing forces. Compressive strength for materials is generally
      higher than their tensile strength. However, structures loaded in
      compression are subject to additional failure modes, such as buckling,
      that are dependent on the member's geometry.
    * Tensile_stress is the stress state caused by an applied load that tends
      to elongate the material along the axis of the applied load, in other
      words the stress caused by pulling the material. The strength of
      structures of equal cross sectional area loaded in tension is independent
      of shape of the cross section. Materials loaded in tension are
      susceptible to stress_concentrations such as material defects or abrupt
      changes in geometry. However, materials exhibiting ductile behavior (most
      metals for example) can tolerate some defects while brittle materials
      (such as ceramics) can fail well below their ultimate material strength.
    * Shear_stress is the stress state caused by the combined energy of a pair
      of opposing forces acting along parallel lines of action through the
      material, in other words the stress caused by faces of the material
      sliding relative to one another. An example is cutting paper with
      scissors[4] or stresses due to torsional loading.
**** Strength terms[edit] ****
Mechanical properties of materials include the yield strength, tensile
strength, fatigue strength, crack resistance, and other characteristics.[5]
    * Yield_strength is the lowest stress that produces a permanent deformation
      in a material. In some materials, like aluminium_alloys, the point of
      yielding is difficult to identify, thus it is usually defined as the
      stress required to cause 0.2% plastic strain. This is called a 0.2% proof
      stress.[6]
    * Compressive_strength is a limit state of compressive_stress that leads to
      failure in a material in the manner of ductile failure (infinite
      theoretical yield) or brittle failure (rupture as the result of crack
      propagation, or sliding along a weak plane — see shear_strength).
    * Tensile_strength or ultimate tensile strength is a limit state of tensile
      stress that leads to tensile failure in the manner of ductile failure
      (yield as the first stage of that failure, some hardening in the second
      stage and breakage after a possible "neck" formation) or brittle failure
      (sudden breaking in two or more pieces at a low stress state). Tensile
      strength can be quoted as either true stress or engineering stress, but
      engineering stress is the most commonly used.
    * Fatigue_strength is a measure of the strength of a material or a
      component under cyclic loading,[7] and is usually more difficult to
      assess than the static strength measures. Fatigue strength is quoted as
      stress amplitude or stress range (    &#x0394; &#x03C3; =  &#x03C3;   m a
      x    &#x2212;  &#x03C3;   m i n      {\displaystyle \Delta \sigma =\sigma
      _{\mathrm {max} }-\sigma _{\mathrm {min} }}  [\Delta\sigma=
      \sigma_\mathrm{max} - \sigma_\mathrm{min}]), usually at zero mean stress,
      along with the number of cycles to failure under that condition of
      stress.
    * Impact_strength is the capability of the material to withstand a suddenly
      applied load and is expressed in terms of energy. Often measured with the
      Izod_impact_strength_test or Charpy_impact_test, both of which measure
      the impact energy required to fracture a sample. Volume, modulus of
      elasticity, distribution of forces, and yield strength affect the impact
      strength of a material. In order for a material or object to have a high
      impact strength the stresses must be distributed evenly throughout the
      object. It also must have a large volume with a low modulus of elasticity
      and a high material yield strength.[8]
**** Strain (deformation) terms[edit] ****
    * Deformation of the material is the change in geometry created when stress
      is applied ( as a result of applied forces, gravitational fields,
      accelerations, thermal expansion, etc.). Deformation is expressed by the
      displacement field of the material.[9]
    * Strain or reduced deformation is a mathematical term that expresses the
      trend of the deformation change among the material field. Strain is the
      deformation per unit length.[10] In the case of uniaxial loading the
      displacements of a specimen (for example a bar element) lead to a
      calculation of strain expressed as the quotient of the displacement and
      the original length of the specimen. For 3D displacement fields it is
      expressed as derivatives of displacement functions in terms of a second
      order tensor (with 6 independent elements).
    * Deflection is a term to describe the magnitude to which a structural
      element is displaced when subject to an applied load.[11]
**** Stressâstrain relations[edit] ****
Basic static response of a specimen under tension
    * Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its previous shape
      after stress is released. In many materials, the relation between applied
      stress is directly proportional to the resulting strain (up to a certain
      limit), and a graph representing those two quantities is a straight line.
The slope of this line is known as Young's_modulus, or the "modulus of
elasticity." The modulus of elasticity can be used to determine the
stressâstrain relationship in the linear-elastic portion of the
stressâstrain curve. The linear-elastic region is either below the yield
point, or if a yield point is not easily identified on the stressâstrain plot
it is defined to be between 0 and 0.2% strain, and is defined as the region of
strain in which no yielding (permanent deformation) occurs.[12]
    * Plasticity or plastic deformation is the opposite of elastic deformation
      and is defined as unrecoverable strain. Plastic deformation is retained
      after the release of the applied stress. Most materials in the linear-
      elastic category are usually capable of plastic deformation. Brittle
      materials, like ceramics, do not experience any plastic deformation and
      will fracture under relatively low strain, while ductile materials such
      as metallics, lead, or polymers will plasticly deform much more before a
      fracture initiation.
Consider the difference between a carrot and chewed bubble gum. The carrot will
stretch very little before breaking. The chewed bubble gum, on the other hand,
will plastically deform enormously before finally breaking.
***** Design terms[edit] *****
Ultimate strength is an attribute related to a material, rather than just a
specific specimen made of the material, and as such it is quoted as the force
per unit of cross section area (N/m2). The ultimate strength is the maximum
stress that a material can withstand before it breaks or weakens.[13] For
example, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of AISI 1018 Steel is 440 MN/m2.
In general, the SI unit of stress is the pascal, where 1 Pa = 1 N/m2. In
Imperial units, the unit of stress is given as lbf/inÂ² or pounds-force_per
square_inch. This unit is often abbreviated as psi. One thousand psi is
abbreviated ksi.
A factor_of_safety is a design criteria that an engineered component or
structure must achieve.     F S = U T S  /  R   {\displaystyle FS=UTS/R}  [FS =
UTS/R], where FS: the factor of safety, R: The applied stress, and UTS:
ultimate stress (psi or N/m2)[14]
Margin of Safety is also sometimes used to as design criteria. It is defined MS
= Failure Load/(Factor of Safety × Predicted Load) − 1.
For example, to achieve a factor of safety of 4, the allowable stress in an
AISI 1018 steel component can be calculated to be     R = U T S  /  F S
{\displaystyle R=UTS/FS}  [R = UTS/FS] = 440/4 = 110 MPa, or     R
{\displaystyle R}  [R] = 110Ã106 N/m2. Such allowable stresses are also known
as "design stresses" or "working stresses."
Design stresses that have been determined from the ultimate or yield point
values of the materials give safe and reliable results only for the case of
static loading. Many machine parts fail when subjected to a non steady and
continuously varying loads even though the developed stresses are below the
yield point. Such failures are called fatigue failure. The failure is by a
fracture that appears to be brittle with little or no visible evidence of
yielding. However, when the stress is kept below "fatigue stress" or "endurance
limit stress", the part will endure indefinitely. A purely reversing or cyclic
stress is one that alternates between equal positive and negative peak stresses
during each cycle of operation. In a purely cyclic stress, the average stress
is zero. When a part is subjected to a cyclic stress, also known as stress
range (Sr), it has been observed that the failure of the part occurs after a
number of stress reversals (N) even if the magnitude of the stress range is
below the materialâs yield strength. Generally, higher the range stress, the
fewer the number of reversals needed for failure.
**** Failure theories[edit] ****
There are four failure theories: maximum shear stress theory, maximum normal
stress theory, maximum strain energy theory, and maximum distortion energy
theory. Out of these four theories of failure, the maximum normal stress theory
is only applicable for brittle materials, and the remaining three theories are
applicable for ductile materials. Of the latter three, the distortion energy
theory provides most accurate results in majority of the stress conditions. The
strain energy theory needs the value of Poisson's_ratio of the part material,
which is often not readily available. The maximum shear stress theory is
conservative. For simple unidirectional normal stresses all theories are
equivalent, which means all theories will give the same result.
    * Maximum Shear Stress Theory — This theory postulates that failure will
      occur if the magnitude of the maximum shear stress in the part exceeds
      the shear strength of the material determined from uniaxial testing.
    * Maximum Normal Stress Theory — This theory postulates that failure will
      occur if the maximum normal stress in the part exceeds the ultimate
      tensile stress of the material as determined from uniaxial testing. This
      theory deals with brittle materials only. The maximum tensile stress
      should be less than or equal to ultimate tensile stress divided by factor
      of safety. The magnitude of the maximum compressive stress should be less
      than ultimate compressive stress divided by factor of safety.
    * Maximum Strain Energy Theory — This theory postulates that failure will
      occur when the strain energy per unit volume due to the applied stresses
      in a part equals the strain energy per unit volume at the yield point in
      uniaxial testing.
    * Maximum Distortion Energy Theory — This theory is also known as shear
      energy theory or von_Mises-Hencky_theory. This theory postulates that
      failure will occur when the distortion energy per unit volume due to the
      applied stresses in a part equals the distortion energy per unit volume
      at the yield point in uniaxial testing. The total elastic energy due to
      strain can be divided into two parts: one part causes change in volume,
      and the other part causes change in shape. Distortion energy is the
      amount of energy that is needed to change the shape.
    * Fracture mechanics was established by Alan Arnold Griffith and George
      Rankine Irwin. This important theory is also known as numeric conversion
      of toughness of material in the case of crack existence.
    * Fractology was proposed by Takeo Yokobori because each fracture laws
      including creep rupture criterion must be combined nonlinearly.
A material's strength is dependent on its microstructure. The engineering
processes to which a material is subjected can alter this microstructure. The
variety of strengthening_mechanisms that alter the strength of a material
includes work_hardening, solid_solution_strengthening, precipitation_hardening,
and grain_boundary_strengthening and can be quantitatively and qualitatively
explained. Strengthening mechanisms are accompanied by the caveat that some
other mechanical properties of the material may degenerate in an attempt to
make the material stronger. For example, in grain boundary strengthening,
although yield_strength is maximized with decreasing grain size, ultimately,
very small grain sizes make the material brittle. In general, the yield
strength of a material is an adequate indicator of the material's mechanical
strength. Considered in tandem with the fact that the yield strength is the
parameter that predicts plastic_deformation in the material, one can make
informed decisions on how to increase the strength of a material depending its
microstructural properties and the desired end effect. Strength is expressed in
terms of the limiting values of the compressive_stress, tensile_stress, and
shear_stresses that would cause failure. The effects of dynamic loading are
probably the most important practical consideration of the strength of
materials, especially the problem of fatigue. Repeated loading often initiates
brittle cracks, which grow until failure occurs. The cracks always start at
stress_concentrations, especially changes in cross-section of the product, near
holes and corners at nominal stress levels far lower than those quoted for the
strength of the material.
