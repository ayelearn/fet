From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Vibration isolation is the process of isolating an object, such as a piece of
equipment, from the source of vibrations.
Vibration is undesirable in many domains, primarily engineered systems and
habitable spaces, and methods have been developed to prevent the transfer of
vibration to such systems. Vibrations propagate via mechanical waves and
certain mechanical linkages conduct vibrations more efficiently than others.
Passive vibration isolation makes use of materials and mechanical linkages that
absorb and damp these mechanical waves. Active vibration isolation involves
sensors and actuators that produce disruptive interference that cancels-out
incoming vibration.

***** Passive isolation[edit] *****
"Passive vibration isolation" refers to vibration isolation or mitigation of
vibrations by passive techniques such as rubber pads or mechanical springs, as
opposed to "active vibration isolation" or "electronic force cancellation"
employing electric power, sensors, actuators, and control systems.
Passive vibration isolation is a vast subject, since there are many types of
passive vibration isolators used for many different applications. A few of
these applications are for industrial equipment such as pumps, motors, HVAC
systems, or washing machines; isolation of civil engineering structures from
earthquakes (base isolation),[1] sensitive laboratory equipment, valuable
statuary, and high-end audio.
A basic understanding of how passive isolation works, the more common types of
passive isolators, and the main factors that influence the selection of passive
isolators:
**** Common passive isolation systems[edit] ****
  Pneumatic or air isolators
      These are bladders or canisters of compressed air. A source of compressed
      air is required to maintain them. Air springs are rubber bladders which
      provide damping as well as isolation and are used in large trucks. Some
      pneumatic isolators can attain low resonant frequencies and are used for
      isolating large industrial equipment. Air tables consist of a working
      surface or optical surface mounted on air legs. These tables provide
      enough isolation for laboratory instrument under some conditions. Air
      systems may leak under vacuum conditions. The air container can interfere
      with isolation of low-amplitude vibration.
  Mechanical springs and spring-dampers
      These are heavy-duty isolators used for building systems and industry.
      Sometimes they serve as mounts for a concrete block, which provides
      further isolation.
  Pads or sheets of flexible materials such as elastomers, rubber, cork, dense
  foam and laminate materials.
      Elastomer pads, dense closed cell foams and laminate materials are often
      used under heavy machinery, under common household items, in vehicles and
      even under higher performing audio systems.[citation_needed]
  Molded and bonded rubber and elastomeric isolators and mounts
      These are often used as machinery mounts or in vehicles. They absorb
      shock and attenuate some vibration.
  Negative-stiffness isolators
      Negative-stiffness isolators are less common than other types and have
      generally been developed for high-level research applications such as
      gravity wave detection. Lee, Goverdovskiy, and Temnikov (2007) proposed a
      negative-stiffness system for isolating vehicle seats.
      The focus on negative-stiffness isolators has been on developing systems
      with very low resonant frequencies (below 1 Hz), so that low frequencies
      can be adequately isolated, which is critical for sensitive
      instrumentation. All higher frequencies are also isolated. Negative-
      stiffness systems can be made with low stiction, so that they are
      effective in isolating low-amplitude vibrations.
      Negative-stiffness mechanisms are purely mechanical and typically involve
      the configuration and loading of components such as beams or inverted
      pendulums. Greater loading of the negative-stiffness mechanism, within
      the range of its operability, decreases the natural frequency.
  Wire rope isolators
Coiled Cable Mount
      These isolators are durable and can withstand extreme environments. They
      are often used in military applications.[2][3]
  Base isolators for seismic isolation of buildings, bridges, etc.
      Base isolators made of layers of neoprene and steel with a low horizontal
      stiffness are used to lower the natural frequency of the building. Some
      other base isolators are designed to slide, preventing the transfer of
      energy from the ground to the building.
  Tuned mass dampers
      Tuned_mass_dampers reduce the effects of harmonic vibration in buildings
      or other structures. A relatively small mass is attached in such a way
      that it can dampen out a very narrow band of vibration of the structure.
  Do it Yourself Isolators
      In less sophisticated solutions, bungee cords can be used as a cheap
      isolation system which may be effective enough for some applications. The
      item to be isolated is suspended from the bungee cords. This is difficult
      to implement without a danger of the isolated item falling. Tennis balls
      cut in half have been used under washing machines and other items with
      some success.
**** How passive isolation works[edit] ****
A passive isolation system, such as a shock_mount, in general contains mass,
spring, and damping elements and moves as a harmonic_oscillator. The mass and
spring stiffness dictate a natural frequency of the system. Damping causes
energy dissipation and has a secondary effect on natural frequency.
Passive Vibration Isolation
Every object on a flexible support has a fundamental natural frequency. When
vibration is applied, energy is transferred most efficiently at the natural
frequency, somewhat efficiently below the natural frequency, and with
increasing inefficiency (decreasing efficiency) above the natural frequency.
This can be seen in the transmissibility curve, which is a plot of
transmissibility vs. frequency.
Here is an example of a transmissibility curve. Transmissibility is the ratio
of vibration of the isolated surface to that of the source. Vibrations are
never completely eliminated, but they can be greatly reduced. The curve below
shows the typical performance of a passive, negative-stiffness isolation system
with a natural frequency of 0.5 Hz. The general shape of the curve is typical
for passive systems. Below the natural frequency, transmissibility hovers near
1. A value of 1 means that vibration is going through the system without being
amplified or reduced. At the resonant frequency, energy is transmitted
efficiently, and the incoming vibration is amplified. Damping in the system
limits the level of amplification. Above the resonant frequency, little energy
can be transmitted, and the curve rolls off to a low value. A passive isolator
can be seen as a mechanical low-pass_filter for vibrations.
negative-stiffness transmissibility
In general, for any given frequency above the natural frequency, an isolator
with a lower natural frequency will show greater isolation than one with a
higher natural frequency. The best isolation system for a given situation
depends on the frequency, direction, and magnitude of vibrations present and
the desired level of attenuation of those frequencies.
All mechanical systems in the real world contain some amount of damping.
Damping dissipates energy in the system, which reduces the vibration level
which is transmitted at the natural frequency. The fluid in automotive shock
absorbers is a kind of damper, as is the inherent damping in elastomeric
(rubber) engine mounts.
Damping is used in passive isolators to reduce the amount of amplification at
the natural frequency. However, increasing damping tends to reduce isolation at
the higher frequencies. As damping is increased, transmissibility roll-off
decreases. This can be seen in the chart below.
Damping effect on transmissibility
Passive isolation operates in both directions, isolating the payload from
vibrations originating in the support, and also isolating the support from
vibrations originating in the payload. Large machines such as washers, pumps,
and generators, which would cause vibrations in the building or room, are often
isolated from the floor. However, there are a multitude of sources of vibration
in buildings, and it is often not possible to isolate each source. In many
cases, it is most efficient to isolate each sensitive instrument from the
floor. Sometimes it is necessary to implement both approaches.
*** Factors influencing the selection of passive vibration isolators[edit] ***
   1. Characteristics of item to be isolated
          o Size: The dimensions of the item to be isolated help determine the
            type of isolation which is available and appropriate. Small objects
            may use only one isolator, while larger items might use a multiple-
            isolator system.
          o Weight: The weight of the object to be isolated is an important
            factor in choosing the correct passive isolation product.
            Individual passive isolators are designed to be used with a
            specific range of loading.
          o Movement: Machines or instruments with moving parts may affect
            isolation systems. It is important to know the mass, speed, and
            distance traveled of the moving parts.
   2. Operating Environment
          o Industrial: This generally entails strong vibrations over a wide
            band of frequencies and some amount of dust.
          o Laboratory: Labs are sometimes troubled by specific building
            vibrations from adjacent machinery, foot traffic, or HVAC airflow.
          o Indoor or outdoor: Isolators are generally designed for one
            environment or the other.
          o Corrosive/non-corrosive: Some indoor environments may present a
            corrosive danger to isolator components due to the presence of
            corrosive chemicals. Outdoors, water and salt environments need to
            be considered.
          o Clean room: Some isolators can be made appropriate for clean room.
          o Temperature: In general, isolators are designed to be used in the
            range of temperatures normal for human environments. If a larger
            range of temperatures is required, the isolator design may need to
            be modified.
          o Vacuum: Some isolators can be used in a vacuum environment. Air
            isolators may have leakage problems. Vacuum requirements typically
            include some level of clean room requirement and may also have a
            large temperature range.
          o Magnetism: Some experimentation which requires vibration isolation
            also requires a low-magnetism environment. Some isolators can be
            designed with low-magnetism components.
          o Acoustic noise: Some instruments are sensitive to acoustic
            vibration. In addition, some isolation systems can be excited by
            acoustic noise. It may be necessary to use an acoustic shield. Air
            compressors can create problematic acoustic noise, heat, and
            airflow.
          o Static or dynamic loads: This distinction is quite important as
            isolators are designed for a certain type and level of loading.
              Static loading
                  is basically the weight of the isolated object with low-
                  amplitude vibration input. This is the environment of
                  apparently stationary objects such as buildings (under normal
                  conditions) or laboratory instruments.
              Dynamic loading
                  involves accelerations and larger amplitude shock and
                  vibration. This environment is present in vehicles, heavy
                  machinery, and structures with significant movement.
   3. Cost:
          o Cost of providing isolation: Costs include the isolation system
            itself, whether it is a standard or custom product; a compressed
            air source if required; shipping from manufacturer to destination;
            installation; maintenance; and an initial vibration site survey to
            determine the need for isolation.
          o Relative costs of different isolation systems: Inexpensive shock
            mounts may need to be replaced due to dynamic loading cycles. A
            higher level of isolation which is effective at lower vibration
            frequencies and magnitudes generally costs more. Prices can range
            from a few dollars for bungee cords to millions of dollars for some
            space applications.
   4. Adjustment: Some isolation systems require manual adjustment to
      compensate for changes in weight load, weight distribution, temperature,
      and air pressure, whereas other systems are designed to automatically
      compensate for some or all of these factors.
   5. Maintenance: Some isolation systems are quite durable and require little
      or no maintenance. Others may require periodic replacement due to
      mechanical fatigue of parts or aging of materials.
   6. Size Constraints: The isolation system may have to fit in a restricted
      space in a laboratory or vacuum chamber, or within a machine housing.
   7. Nature of vibrations to be isolated or mitigated
          o Frequencies: If possible, it is important to know the frequencies
            of ambient vibrations. This can be determined with a site survey or
            accelerometer data processed through FFT analysis.
          o Amplitudes: The amplitudes of the vibration frequencies present can
            be compared with required levels to determine whether isolation is
            needed. In addition, isolators are designed for ranges of vibration
            amplitudes. Some isolators are not effective for very small
            amplitudes.
          o Direction: Knowing whether vibrations are horizontal or vertical
            can help to target isolation where it is needed and save money.
   8. Vibration specifications of item to be isolated: Many instruments or
      machines have manufacturer-specified levels of vibration for the
      operating environment. The manufacturer may not guarantee the proper
      operation of the instrument if vibration exceeds the spec.
   9. Not For Profit Organizations such as ASHRAE (American Society of Heating,
      Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) and VISCMA (Vibration
      Isolation and Seismic Control Manufacturers Association) provide
      specifications / standards for isolator types and spring deflection
      requirements that cover a wide array of industries including electrical,
      mechanical, plumbing, and HVAC.

**** Negative-stiffness vibration isolator[edit] ****
Negative-Stiffness-Mechanism (NSM) vibration isolation systems offer a unique
passive approach for achieving low vibration environments and isolation against
sub-Hertz vibrations. "Snap-through" or "over-center" NSM devices are used to
reduce the stiffness of elastic suspensions and create compact six-degree-of-
freedom systems with low natural frequencies. Practical systems with vertical
and horizontal natural frequencies as low as 0.2 to 0.5 Hz are possible.
Electro-mechanical auto-adjust mechanisms compensate for varying weight loads
and provide automatic leveling in multiple-isolator systems, similar to the
function of leveling valves in pneumatic systems. All-metal systems can be
configured which are compatible with high vacuums and other adverse
environments such as high temperatures.
These isolation systems enable vibration-sensitive instruments such as scanning
probe microscopes, micro-hardness testers and scanning electron microscopes to
operate in severe vibration environments sometimes encountered, for example, on
upper floors of buildings and in clean rooms. Such operation would not be
practical with pneumatic isolation systems.[citation_needed] Similarly, they
enable vibration-sensitive instruments to produce better images and data than
those achievable with pneumatic isolators.[citation_needed]
The theory of operation of NSM vibration isolation systems is summarized, some
typical systems and applications are described, and data on measured
performance is presented. The theory of NSM isolation systems is explained in
References 1 and 2.[clarification_needed] It is summarized briefly for
convenience.
*** Vertical-motion isolation[edit] ***
A vertical-motion isolator is shown . It uses a conventional spring connected
to an NSM consisting of two bars hinged at the center, supported at their outer
ends on pivots, and loaded in compression by forces P. The spring is compressed
by weight W to the operating position of the isolator, as shown in Figure 1.
The stiffness of the isolator is K=KS-KN where KS is the spring stiffness and
KN is the magnitude of a negative-stiffness which is a function of the length
of the bars and the load P. The isolator stiffness can be made to approach zero
while the spring supports the weight W.
*** Horizontal-motion isolation[edit] ***
A horizontal-motion isolator consisting of two beam-columns is illustrated in
Figure. 2. Each beam-column behaves like two fixed-free beam columns loaded
axially by a weight load W. Without the weight load the beam-columns have
horizontal stiffness KS With the weight load the lateral bending stiffness is
reduced by the "beam-column" effect. This behavior is equivalent to a
horizontal spring combined with an NSM so that the horizontal stiffness is
K =  K  S   &#x2212;  K  N     {\displaystyle K=K_{S}-K_{N}}  [{\displaystyle
K=K_{S}-K_{N}}], and      K  N     {\displaystyle K_{N}}  [K_{N}] is the
magnitude of the beam-column effect. Horizontal stiffness can be made to
approach zero by loading the beam-columns to approach their critical buckling
load.
[Beam_column_vibration_isolation]
*** Six-degree-of-freedom (six-DOF) isolation[edit] ***
A six-DOF NSM isolator typically uses three isolators stacked in series: a
tilt-motion isolator on top of a horizontal-motion isolator on top of a
vertical-motion isolator. Figure 3 shows a schematic of a vibration isolation
system consisting of a weighted platform supported by a single six-DOF isolator
incorporating the isolators of Figures 1 and 2. Flexures are used in place of
the hinged bars shown in Figure 1. A tilt flexure serves as the tilt-motion
isolator. A vertical-stiffness adjustment screw is used to adjust the
compression force on the negative-stiffness flexures thereby changing the
vertical stiffness. A vertical load adjustment screw is used to adjust for
varying weight loads by raising or lowering the base of the support spring to
keep the flexures in their straight, unbent operating positions.
[Negative_Stiffness_Vibration_Isolator_Drawing.jpg]
**** Vibration isolation of supporting joint[edit] ****
The equipment or other mechanical components are necessarily linked to
surrounding objects (the supporting joint - with the support; the unsupporting
joint - the pipe duct or cable), thus presenting the opportunity for unwanted
transmission of vibrations. Using a suitably designed vibration-isolator
(absorber), vibration isolation of the supporting joint is realized. The
accompanying illustration shows the attenuation of vibration levels, as
measured before installation of the functioning gear on a vibration isolator as
well as after installation, for a wide range of frequencies.
*** The vibration isolator[edit] ***
[Vibration-isolator.jpg]
This is defined as a device that reflects and absorbs waves of oscillatory
energy, extending from a piece of working machinery or electrical equipment,
and with the desired effect being vibration insulation. The goal is to
establish vibration isolation between a body transferring mechanical
fluctuations and a supporting body (for example, between the machine and the
foundation). The illustration shows a vibration isolator from the series
Â«ÐÐÂ» (~"VI" in Roman characters), as used in shipbuilding in Russia, for
example the submarine "St.Petersburg" (Lada). The depicted Â«ÐÐÂ» devices
allow loadings ranging from 5, 40 and 300 kg. They differ in their physical
sizes, but all share the same fundamental design. The structure consists of a
rubber envelope that is internally reinforced by a spring. During manufacture,
the rubber and the spring are intimately and permanently connected as a result
of the vulcanization process that is integral to the processing of the crude
rubber material. Under action of weight loading of the machine, the rubber
envelope deforms, and the spring is compressed or stretched. Therefore, in the
direction of the spring's cross section, twisting of the enveloping rubber
occurs. The resulting elastic deformation of the rubber envelope results in
very effective absorption of the vibration. This absorption is crucial to
reliable vibration insulation, because it averts the potential for resonance
effects. The amount of elastic deformation of the rubber largely dictates the
magnitude of vibration absorption that can be attained; the entire device
(including the spring itself) must be designed with this in mind. The design of
the vibration isolator must also take into account potential exposure to shock
loadings, in addition to the routine everyday vibrations. Lastly, the vibration
isolator must also be designed for long-term durability as well as convenient
integration into the environment in which it is to be used. Sleeves and flanges
are typically employed in order to enable the vibration isolator to be securely
fastened to the equipment and the supporting foundation.
**** Vibration isolation of unsupporting joint[edit] ****
Vibration isolation of unsupporting joint is realized in the device named
branch pipe a of isolating vibration.
*** Branch pipe a of isolating vibration[edit] ***
Branch pipe a of isolating vibration is a part of a tube with elastic walls for
reflection and absorption of waves of the oscillatory energy extending from the
working pump over wall of the pipe duct. Is established between the pump and
the pipe duct. On an illustration is presented the image a vibration-isolating
branch pipe of a series Â«ÐÐÐÐÂ». In a structure is used the rubber
envelope, which is reinforced by a spring. Properties of an envelope are
similar envelope to an isolator vibration. Has the device reducing axial effort
from action of internal pressure up to zero.
**** Subframe isolation[edit] ****
Subframe vibration isolation graph: force transmission on suspended body vs.
frequency for rigidly and compliantly mounted subframes.
Another technique used to increase isolation is to use an isolated subframe.
This splits the system with an additional mass/spring/damper system. This
doubles the high frequency attenuation rolloff, at the cost of introducing
additional low frequency modes which may cause the low frequency behaviour to
deteriorate. This is commonly used in the rear suspensions of cars with
Independent Rear Suspension (IRS), and in the front subframes of some cars. The
graph (see illustration) shows the force into the body for a subframe that is
rigidly bolted to the body compared with the red curve that shows a compliantly
mounted subframe. Above 42 Hz the compliantly mounted subframe is superior, but
below that frequency the bolted in subframe is better.
***** Semi-active isolation[edit] *****
Semiactive vibration isolators have received attention because they consume
less power than active devices and controllability over passive systems.
***** Active isolation[edit] *****
Active vibration isolation systems contain, along with the spring, a feedback
circuit which consists of a sensor (for example a piezoelectric accelerometer
or a geophone), a controller, and an actuator. The acceleration (vibration)
signal is processed by a control circuit and amplifier. Then it feeds the
electromagnetic actuator, which amplifies the signal. As a result of such a
feedback system, a considerably stronger suppression of vibrations is achieved
compared to ordinary damping. Active isolation today is used for applications
where structures smaller than a micrometer have to be produced or measured. A
couple of companies produce active isolation products as OEM for research,
metrology, lithography and medical systems. Another important application is
the semiconductor industry. In the microchip production, the smallest
structures today are below 20 nm, so the machines which produce and check them
have to oscillate much less.
