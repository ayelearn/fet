***** History[edit] *****
The first issue of Shafts was published in November 1892.[1] It was founded and
edited by Margaret_Sibthorp and was initially funded by an anonymous friend.[2]
By June 1893, however, Sibthorp had begun to appeal to readers for financial
support. Owing to a lack of funds Shafts became a monthly publication in 1893,
having initially been published weekly. Sibthorp was forced to downsize the
magazine's London offices near the_Strandâwhich had once been the location
for women's classes, lecture courses and meetingsâto a single room, before
relocating to her home in suburban West_Hampstead in 1895.[3]
In 1898 the frequency of publication was slowed from monthly to bi-monthly, and
in 1899, following an announcement that it would henceforth become quarterly,
Shafts ceased publication altogether. The magazine's decline has been
attributed to Sibthorp's refusal to follow the emerging "'New Journalism'
formula of information, gossip and entertainment", which led to Shafts' loss of
readers to competing publications.[4]
Shafts was sold for one penny and was targeted towards lower-middle class
women. Most of the magazine's correspondents and contributing writersâwith
Sibthorp as a notable exceptionâwere published under pseudonyms.[5]
***** Content[edit] *****
Its themes included votes for women, women's education, and "radical" attitudes
towards vivisection, dress reform, women's control of their sexuality, child
care, and vegetarianism.[6] It published literary criticism, including works
about Shakespearean characters, feminist_poetry, and book recommendations for
young women.[7] Sibthorp was a member of the Theosophical_Society, which was
reflected in Shafts' extensive coverage of occult and psychical topics.[8] As
noted by Claudia Nelson in her book Invisible Men, Shafts "offered little
factual reportage" and instead largely consisted of opinion pieces,
correspondence columns, short stories and poetry.[9]
In an August 1893 editorial, Sibthorp stated that Shafts' purpose was to
promote knowledge amongst women: "that women must first know all things, ere
they can judge of an evil, or any proposed remedy for an evil".[10] Articles
and editorials encouraged women to pursue "an education that might emancipate
them from patriarchal assumptions".[11] Kate Flint notes in her book The Woman
Reader, 1837â1914, that Shafts was one of few feminist periodicals at the
time that promoted the furthering of women's rights through education in
traditionally male-oriented domains, rather than through protection and
control.[12]
The cover of Shafts depicted a woman with a bow shooting an arrow ("shaft")
labelled "wisdom", "truth" and "justice".[13]
