In physics and fluid_mechanics, a boundary layer is an important concept and
refers to the layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding_surface
where the effects of viscosity are significant.
In the Earth's_atmosphere, the atmospheric_boundary_layer is the air layer near
the ground affected by diurnal heat, moisture or momentum transfer to or from
the surface. On an aircraft wing the boundary layer is the part of the flow
close to the wing, where viscous forces distort the surrounding non-viscous
flow.

***** Types of boundary layer[edit] *****
Boundary layer visualization, showing transition from laminar to turbulent
condition
Laminar boundary layers can be loosely classified according to their structure
and the circumstances under which they are created. The thin shear layer which
develops on an oscillating body is an example of a Stokes_boundary_layer, while
the Blasius_boundary_layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an
attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and FalknerâSkan
boundary_layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and
viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis_effect (rather than convective
inertia), an Ekman_layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal
boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer
simultaneously.
The viscous nature of airflow reduces the local velocities on a surface and is
responsible for skin friction. The layer of air over the wing's surface that is
slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer. There are two
different types of boundary layer flow: laminar and turbulent.[1]
Laminar boundary layer flow
The laminar boundary is a very smooth flow, while the turbulent boundary layer
contains swirls or "eddies." The laminar flow creates less skin friction drag
than the turbulent flow, but is less stable. Boundary layer flow over a wing
surface begins as a smooth laminar flow. As the flow continues back from the
leading edge, the laminar boundary layer increases in thickness.
Turbulent boundary layer flow
At some distance back from the leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks
down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is
advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on
the wing as possible, or have a large amount of the wing surface within the
laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however,
tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.
***** Aerodynamics[edit] *****
Ludwig Prandtl
Laminar boundary layer velocity profile
The aerodynamic boundary layer was first defined by Ludwig_Prandtl in a paper
presented on August 12, 1904 at the third International_Congress_of
Mathematicians in Heidelberg,_Germany. It simplifies the equations of fluid
flow by dividing the flow field into two areas: one inside the boundary layer,
dominated by viscosity and creating the majority of drag experienced by the
boundary body; and one outside the boundary layer, where viscosity can be
neglected without significant effects on the solution. This allows a closed-
form solution for the flow in both areas, a significant simplification of the
full NavierâStokes_equations. The majority of the heat_transfer to and from a
body also takes place within the boundary layer, again allowing the equations
to be simplified in the flow field outside the boundary layer. The pressure
distribution throughout the boundary layer in the direction normal to the
surface (such as an airfoil) remains constant throughout the boundary layer,
and is the same as on the surface itself.
The thickness of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as the
distance from the solid body to the point at which the viscous flow velocity is
99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow).
Displacement_thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary
layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at
the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in
the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-
slip_condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be
zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The
flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by
the boundary layer equations, below.
The thermal_boundary_layer_thickness is similarly the distance from the body at
which the temperature is 99% of the freestream temperature. The ratio of the
two thicknesses is governed by the Prandtl_number. If the Prandtl number is 1,
the two boundary layers are the same thickness. If the Prandtl number is
greater than 1, the thermal boundary layer is thinner than the velocity
boundary layer. If the Prandtl number is less than 1, which is the case for air
at standard conditions, the thermal boundary layer is thicker than the velocity
boundary layer.
In high-performance designs, such as gliders and commercial aircraft, much
attention is paid to controlling the behavior of the boundary layer to minimize
drag. Two effects have to be considered. First, the boundary layer adds to the
effective thickness of the body, through the displacement_thickness, hence
increasing the pressure drag. Secondly, the shear forces at the surface of the
wing create skin_friction_drag.
At high Reynolds_numbers, typical of full-sized aircraft, it is desirable to
have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the
characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer
inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the
body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary_layer
transition. One way of dealing with this problem is to suck the boundary layer
away through a porous surface (see Boundary_layer_suction). This can reduce
drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power
required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural_laminar_flow techniques
push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the airfoil or fuselage so
that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities
in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater
length.
At lower Reynolds_numbers, such as those seen with model aircraft, it is
relatively easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which
is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar
boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by
adverse_pressure_gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear
part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the
surface. Such flow_separation causes a large increase in the pressure_drag,
since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these
cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into
turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a
turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows
it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although
the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the
principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex_generators on
aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the
pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This
represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation
and skin friction from induced turbulence.
When using half-models in wind tunnels, a peniche is sometimes used to reduce
or eliminate the effect of the boundary layer.
***** Boundary layer equations[edit] *****
The deduction of the boundary layer equations was one of the most important
advances in fluid dynamics. Using an order_of_magnitude_analysis, the well-
known governing NavierâStokes_equations of viscous fluid flow can be greatly
simplified within the boundary layer. Notably, the characteristic of the
partial_differential_equations_(PDE) becomes parabolic, rather than the
elliptical form of the full NavierâStokes equations. This greatly simplifies
the solution of the equations. By making the boundary layer approximation, the
flow is divided into an inviscid portion (which is easy to solve by a number of
methods) and the boundary layer, which is governed by an easier to solve PDE.
The continuity and NavierâStokes equations for a two-dimensional steady
incompressible_flow in Cartesian_coordinates are given by
            &#x2202; u   &#x2202; x    +    &#x2202; &#x03C5;   &#x2202; y    =
      0   {\displaystyle {\partial u \over \partial x}+{\partial \upsilon \over
      \partial y}=0}  [{\partial u \over \partial x}+{\partial \upsilon  \over
      \partial y}=0]
         u    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; x    + &#x03C5;    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; y

      x}+\upsilon {\partial u \over \partial y}=-{1 \over \rho }{\partial p
      \over \partial x}+{\nu }\left({\partial ^{2}u \over \partial x^{2}}+
      {\partial ^{2}u \over \partial y^{2}}\right)}  [u{\partial u \over
      \partial x}+\upsilon {\partial u \over \partial y}=-{1 \over \rho }
      {\partial p \over \partial x}+{\nu }\left({\partial ^{2}u \over \partial
      x^{2}}+{\partial ^{2}u \over \partial y^{2}}\right)]
         u    &#x2202; &#x03C5;   &#x2202; x    + &#x03C5;    &#x2202; &#x03C5;
      &#x2202; y    = &#x2212;   1 &#x03C1;      &#x2202; p   &#x2202; y    +
      &#x03BD;   (      &#x2202;  2   &#x03C5;   &#x2202;  x  2      +
      &#x2202;  2   &#x03C5;   &#x2202;  y  2       )    {\displaystyle u
      {\partial \upsilon \over \partial x}+\upsilon {\partial \upsilon \over
      \partial y}=-{1 \over \rho }{\partial p \over \partial y}+{\nu }\left(
      {\partial ^{2}\upsilon \over \partial x^{2}}+{\partial ^{2}\upsilon \over
      \partial y^{2}}\right)}  [u{\partial \upsilon  \over \partial x}+\upsilon
      {\partial \upsilon  \over \partial y}=-{1 \over \rho }{\partial p \over
      \partial y}+{\nu }\left({\partial ^{2}\upsilon  \over \partial x^{2}}+
      {\partial ^{2}\upsilon  \over \partial y^{2}}\right)]
where     u   {\displaystyle u}  [u] and     &#x03C5;   {\displaystyle \upsilon
}  [\upsilon ] are the velocity components,     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho
}  [\rho ] is the density,     p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] is the pressure, and
&#x03BD;   {\displaystyle \nu }  [\nu ] is the kinematic_viscosity of the fluid
at a point.
The approximation states that, for a sufficiently high Reynolds_number the flow
over a surface can be divided into an outer region of inviscid flow unaffected
by viscosity (the majority of the flow), and a region close to the surface
where viscosity is important (the boundary layer). Let     u   {\displaystyle
u}  [u] and     &#x03C5;   {\displaystyle \upsilon }  [\upsilon ] be streamwise
and transverse (wall normal) velocities respectively inside the boundary layer.
Using scale_analysis, it can be shown that the above equations of motion reduce
within the boundary layer to become
         u    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; x    + &#x03C5;    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; y
      = &#x2212;   1 &#x03C1;      &#x2202; p   &#x2202; x    +  &#x03BD;
      &#x2202;  2   u   &#x2202;  y  2        {\displaystyle u{\partial u \over
      \partial x}+\upsilon {\partial u \over \partial y}=-{1 \over \rho }
      {\partial p \over \partial x}+{\nu }{\partial ^{2}u \over \partial y^
      {2}}}  [u{\partial u \over \partial x}+\upsilon {\partial u \over
      \partial y}=-{1 \over \rho }{\partial p \over \partial x}+{\nu }{\partial
      ^{2}u \over \partial y^{2}}]
           1 &#x03C1;      &#x2202; p   &#x2202; y    = 0   {\displaystyle {1
      \over \rho }{\partial p \over \partial y}=0}  [{1 \over \rho }{\partial p
      \over \partial y}=0]
and if the fluid is incompressible (as liquids are under standard conditions):
            &#x2202; u   &#x2202; x    +    &#x2202; &#x03C5;   &#x2202; y    =
      0   {\displaystyle {\partial u \over \partial x}+{\partial \upsilon \over
      \partial y}=0}  [{\partial u \over \partial x}+{\partial \upsilon  \over
      \partial y}=0]
The order of magnitude analysis assumes the streamwise length scale
significantly larger than the transverse length scale inside the boundary
layer. It follows that variations in properties in the streamwise direction are
generally much lower than those in the wall normal direction. Apply this to the
continuity equation shows that     &#x03C5;   {\displaystyle \upsilon }
[\upsilon ], the wall normal velocity, is small compared with     u
{\displaystyle u}  [u] the streamwise velocity.
Since the static pressure     p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] is independent of
y   {\displaystyle y}  [y], then pressure at the edge of the boundary layer is
the pressure throughout the boundary layer at a given streamwise position. The
external pressure may be obtained through an application of Bernoulli's
equation. Let     U   {\displaystyle U}  [ U ] be the fluid velocity outside
the boundary layer, where     u   {\displaystyle u}  [u] and     U
{\displaystyle U}  [ U ] are both parallel. This gives upon substituting for
p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] the following result
         u    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; x    + &#x03C5;    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; y
      = U    d U   d x    +  &#x03BD;      &#x2202;  2   u   &#x2202;  y  2
      {\displaystyle u{\partial u \over \partial x}+\upsilon {\partial u \over
      \partial y}=U{\frac {dU}{dx}}+{\nu }{\partial ^{2}u \over \partial y^
      {2}}}  [{\displaystyle u{\partial u \over \partial x}+\upsilon {\partial
      u \over \partial y}=U{\frac {dU}{dx}}+{\nu }{\partial ^{2}u \over
      \partial y^{2}}}]
For a flow in which the static pressure     p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] also
does not change in the direction of the flow
            d p   d x    = 0   {\displaystyle {\frac {dp}{dx}}=0}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {dp}{dx}}=0}]
so     U   {\displaystyle U}  [ U ] remains constant.
Therefore, the equation of motion simplifies to become
         u    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; x    + &#x03C5;    &#x2202; u   &#x2202; y
      =  &#x03BD;      &#x2202;  2   u   &#x2202;  y  2        {\displaystyle u
      {\partial u \over \partial x}+\upsilon {\partial u \over \partial y}={\nu
      }{\partial ^{2}u \over \partial y^{2}}}  [u{\partial u \over \partial
      x}+\upsilon {\partial u \over \partial y}={\nu }{\partial ^{2}u \over
      \partial y^{2}}]
These approximations are used in a variety of practical flow problems of
scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any
instantaneous laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in
laminar flow studies since the mean flow is also the instantaneous flow because
there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a
parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution often referred to
as the Blasius_boundary_layer.
**** Prandtl's transposition theorem[edit] ****
Prandtl[2] observed that from any solution     u ( x , y , t ) , &#xA0; v ( x ,
y , t )   {\displaystyle u(x,y,t),\ v(x,y,t)}  [{\displaystyle u(x,y,t),\ v
(x,y,t)}] which satisfies the boundary layer equations, further solution      u
&#x2217;   ( x , y , t ) , &#xA0;  v  &#x2217;   ( x , y , t )   {\displaystyle
u^{*}(x,y,t),\ v^{*}(x,y,t)}  [{\displaystyle u^{*}(x,y,t),\ v^{*}(x,y,t)}],
which is also satisfying the boundary layer equations, can be constructed by
writing
          u  &#x2217;   ( x , y , t ) = u ( x , y + f ( x ) , t ) ,   v
      &#x2217;   ( x , y , t ) = v ( x , y + f ( x ) , t ) &#x2212;  f &#x2032;
      ( x ) u ( x , y + f ( x ) , t )   {\displaystyle u^{*}(x,y,t)=u(x,y+f
      (x),t),\quad v^{*}(x,y,t)=v(x,y+f(x),t)-f'(x)u(x,y+f(x),t)}  [
      {\displaystyle u^{*}(x,y,t)=u(x,y+f(x),t),\quad v^{*}(x,y,t)=v(x,y+f
      (x),t)-f'(x)u(x,y+f(x),t)}]
where     f ( x )   {\displaystyle f(x)}  [f(x)] is arbitrary. Since the
solution is not unique from mathematical perspective,[3] to the solution can
added any one of an infinite set of eigenfunctions as shown by Stewartson[4]
and Paul_A._Libby.[5][6]

For steady two-dimensional boundary layers, von_Mises[11] introduced a

This transformation is later extended to compressible boundary layer by von
KÃ¡rmÃ¡n and HS_Tsien.[12]
**** Crocco's transformation[edit] ****
For steady two-dimensional compressible boundary layer, Luigi_Crocco[13]
introduced a transformation which takes     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x] and
u   {\displaystyle u}  [u] as independent variables instead of     x
{\displaystyle x}  [x] and     y   {\displaystyle y}  [y] and uses a dependent
variable     &#x03C4; = &#x03BC; &#x2202; u  /  &#x2202; y   {\displaystyle
\tau =\mu \partial u/\partial y}  [{\displaystyle \tau =\mu \partial u/\partial
y}](shear stress) instead of     u   {\displaystyle u}  [u]. The boundary layer
equation then becomes

***** Turbulent boundary layers[edit] *****
The treatment of turbulent boundary layers is far more difficult due to the
time-dependent variation of the flow properties. One of the most widely used
techniques in which turbulent flows are tackled is to apply Reynolds
decomposition. Here the instantaneous flow properties are decomposed into a
mean and fluctuating component. Applying this technique to the boundary layer
equations gives the full turbulent boundary layer equations not often given in
literature:

Using a similar order-of-magnitude analysis, the above equations can be reduced
to leading order terms. By choosing length scales     &#x03B4;   {\displaystyle
\delta }  [\delta ] for changes in the transverse-direction, and     L
{\displaystyle L}  [L] for changes in the streamwise-direction, with
&#x03B4; << L   {\displaystyle \delta <<L}  [\delta <<L], the x-momentum
equation simplifies to:
           u &#x00AF;      &#x2202;   u &#x00AF;     &#x2202; x    +   v
      &#x00AF;      &#x2202;   u &#x00AF;     &#x2202; y    = &#x2212;   1
      &#x03C1;      &#x2202;   p &#x00AF;     &#x2202; x    &#x2212;   &#x2202;
      &#x2202; y    (     u &#x2032;   v &#x2032;   &#x00AF;   ) .
      {\displaystyle {\overline {u}}{\partial {\overline {u}} \over \partial
      x}+{\overline {v}}{\partial {\overline {u}} \over \partial y}=-{1 \over
      \rho }{\partial {\overline {p}} \over \partial x}-{\frac {\partial }
      {\partial y}}({\overline {u'v'}}).}  [{\displaystyle {\overline {u}}
      {\partial {\overline {u}} \over \partial x}+{\overline {v}}{\partial
      {\overline {u}} \over \partial y}=-{1 \over \rho }{\partial {\overline
      {p}} \over \partial x}-{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}({\overline
      {u'v'}}).}]
This equation does not satisfy the no-slip_condition at the wall. Like Prandtl
did for his boundary layer equations, a new, smaller length scale must be used
to allow the viscous term to become leading order in the momentum equation. By
choosing     &#x03B7; << &#x03B4;   {\displaystyle \eta <<\delta }  [\eta
<<\delta ] as the y-scale, the leading order momentum equation for this "inner
boundary layer" is given by:
         0 = &#x2212;   1 &#x03C1;      &#x2202;   p &#x00AF;     &#x2202; x
      +  &#x03BD;      &#x2202;  2     u &#x00AF;     &#x2202;  y  2
      &#x2212;   &#x2202;  &#x2202; y    (     u &#x2032;   v &#x2032;
      &#x00AF;   ) .   {\displaystyle 0=-{1 \over \rho }{\partial {\overline
      {p}} \over \partial x}+{\nu }{\partial ^{2}{\overline {u}} \over \partial
      y^{2}}-{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}({\overline {u'v'}}).}  [
      {\displaystyle 0=-{1 \over \rho }{\partial {\overline {p}} \over \partial
      x}+{\nu }{\partial ^{2}{\overline {u}} \over \partial y^{2}}-{\frac
      {\partial }{\partial y}}({\overline {u'v'}}).}]
In the limit of infinite Reynolds number, the pressure gradient term can be
shown to have no effect on the inner region of the turbulent boundary layer.
The new "inner length scale"     &#x03B7;   {\displaystyle \eta }  [\eta ] is a
viscous length scale, and is of order       &#x03BD;  u  &#x2217;
{\displaystyle {\frac {\nu }{u_{*}}}}  [{\frac {\nu }{u_{*}}}], with      u
&#x2217;     {\displaystyle u_{*}}  [u_{*}] being the velocity scale of the
turbulent fluctuations, in this case a friction_velocity.
Unlike the laminar boundary layer equations, the presence of two regimes
governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. the inner and outer scaling)
has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent boundary
layer difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans
both regions of the flow, it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions
from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called
log-law or power-law.
The additional term         u &#x2032;   v &#x2032;   &#x00AF;
{\displaystyle {\overline {u'v'}}}  [{\overline {u'v'}}] in the turbulent
boundary layer equations is known as the Reynolds shear stress and is unknown a
priori. The solution of the turbulent boundary layer equations therefore
necessitates the use of a turbulence_model, which aims to express the Reynolds
shear stress in terms of known flow variables or derivatives. The lack of
accuracy and generality of such models is a major obstacle in the successful
prediction of turbulent flow properties in modern fluid dynamics.
A constant stress layer exists in the near wall region. Due to the damping of
the vertical velocity fluctuations near the wall, the Reynolds stress term will
become negligible and we find that a linear velocity profile exists. This is
only true for the very near_wall_region.
***** Heat and mass transfer[edit] *****
In 1928, the French engineer AndrÃ©_LÃ©vÃªque observed that convective heat
transfer in a flowing fluid is affected only by the velocity values very close
to the surface.[14][15] For flows of large Prandtl number, the temperature/mass
transition from surface to freestream temperature takes place across a very
thin region close to the surface. Therefore, the most important fluid
velocities are those inside this very thin region in which the change in
velocity can be considered linear with normal distance from the surface. In
this way, for
         u ( y ) = U  [  1 &#x2212;    ( y &#x2212; h  )  2     h  2      ]  =
      U   y h    [  2 &#x2212;   y h    ]   ,   {\displaystyle u(y)=U\left[1-
      {\frac {(y-h)^{2}}{h^{2}}}\right]=U{\frac {y}{h}}\left[2-{\frac {y}
      {h}}\right]\;,}  [{\displaystyle u(y)=U\left[1-{\frac {(y-h)^{2}}{h^
      {2}}}\right]=U{\frac {y}{h}}\left[2-{\frac {y}{h}}\right]\;,}]
when     y &#x2192; 0   {\displaystyle y\rightarrow 0}  [y\rightarrow 0], then
         u ( y ) &#x2248; 2 U   y h   = &#x03B8; y ,   {\displaystyle u
      (y)\approx 2U{\frac {y}{h}}=\theta y,}  [{\displaystyle u(y)\approx 2U
      {\frac {y}{h}}=\theta y,}]
where Î¸ is the tangent of the Poiseuille parabola intersecting the wall.
Although LÃ©vÃªque's solution was specific to heat transfer into a Poiseuille
flow, his insight helped lead other scientists to an exact solution of the
thermal boundary-layer problem.[16] Schuh observed that in a boundary-layer, u
is again a linear function of y, but that in this case, the wall tangent is a
function of x.[17] He expressed this with a modified version of LÃ©vÃªque's
profile,
         u ( y ) = &#x03B8; ( x ) y .   {\displaystyle u(y)=\theta (x)y.}  [
      {\displaystyle u(y)=\theta (x)y.}]
This results in a very good approximation, even for low     P r
{\displaystyle Pr}  [Pr] numbers, so that only liquid metals with     P r
{\displaystyle Pr}  [Pr] much less than 1 cannot be treated this way.[16] In
1962, Kestin and Persen published a paper describing solutions for heat
transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the
momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions.[18] For the
problem of a flat plate with a temperature jump at     x =  x  0
{\displaystyle x=x_{0}}  [x=x_{0}], they propose a substitution that reduces
the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential
equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature at any point in the
fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma_function.[15] Schlichting
proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer
equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same
incomplete gamma function.[19]
***** Convective transfer constants from boundary layer analysis[edit] *****
Paul_Richard_Heinrich_Blasius derived an exact solution to the above laminar
boundary_layer equations.[20] The thickness of the boundary layer     &#x03B4;
{\displaystyle \delta }  [\delta ] is a function of the Reynolds_number for
laminar flow.
         &#x03B4; &#x2248; 5.0   x   R e       {\displaystyle \delta \approx
      5.0{x \over {\sqrt {Re}}}}  [{\displaystyle \delta \approx 5.0{x \over
      {\sqrt {Re}}}}]
         &#x03B4;   {\displaystyle \delta }  [\delta ] = the thickness of the
      boundary layer: the region of flow where the velocity is less than 99% of
      the far field velocity      v  &#x221E;     {\displaystyle v_{\infty }}
      [v_{\infty }];     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x] is position along the semi-
      infinite plate, and     R e   {\displaystyle Re}  [Re] is the Reynolds
      Number given by     &#x03C1;  v  &#x221E;   x  /  &#x03BC;
      {\displaystyle \rho v_{\infty }x/\mu }  [\rho v_{\infty }x/\mu ]
      (    &#x03C1; =   {\displaystyle \rho =}  [\rho =] density and
      &#x03BC; =   {\displaystyle \mu =}  [\mu =] dynamic viscosity).
The Blasius solution uses boundary conditions in a dimensionless form:
             v  x   &#x2212;  v  S      v  &#x221E;   &#x2212;  v  S      =
      v  x    v  &#x221E;     =    v  y    v  &#x221E;     = 0   {\displaystyle
      {v_{x}-v_{S} \over v_{\infty }-v_{S}}={v_{x} \over v_{\infty }}={v_{y}
      \over v_{\infty }}=0}  [{v_{x}-v_{S} \over v_{\infty }-v_{S}}={v_{x}
      \over v_{\infty }}={v_{y} \over v_{\infty }}=0]     at         y = 0
      {\displaystyle y=0}  [y=0]
             v  x   &#x2212;  v  S      v  &#x221E;   &#x2212;  v  S      =
      v  x    v  &#x221E;     = 1   {\displaystyle {v_{x}-v_{S} \over v_{\infty
      }-v_{S}}={v_{x} \over v_{\infty }}=1}  [{v_{x}-v_{S} \over v_{\infty }-v_
      {S}}={v_{x} \over v_{\infty }}=1]     at         y = &#x221E;
      {\displaystyle y=\infty }  [y=\infty ] and     x = 0   {\displaystyle
      x=0}  [x=0]
[Velocity_and_Temperature_boundary_layers_share_functional_form]
Velocity Boundary Layer (Top, orange) and Temperature Boundary Layer (Bottom,
green) share a functional form due to similarity in the Momentum/Energy
Balances and boundary conditions.
Note that in many cases, the no-slip boundary condition holds that      v  S
{\displaystyle v_{S}}  [v_{S}], the fluid velocity at the surface of the plate
equals the velocity of the plate at all locations. If the plate is not moving,
then      v  S   = 0   {\displaystyle v_{S}=0}  [v_{S}=0]. A much more
complicated derivation is required if fluid slip is allowed.[21]
In fact, the Blasius solution for laminar velocity profile in the boundary
layer above a semi-infinite plate can be easily extended to describe Thermal
and Concentration boundary layers for heat and mass transfer respectively.
Rather than the differential x-momentum balance (equation of motion), this uses
a similarly derived Energy and Mass balance:
Energy:              v  x      &#x2202; T   &#x2202; x    +  v  y      &#x2202;
T   &#x2202; y    =   k  &#x03C1;  C  p          &#x2202;  2   T   &#x2202;  y
2        {\displaystyle v_{x}{\partial T \over \partial x}+v_{y}{\partial T
\over \partial y}={k \over \rho C_{p}}{\partial ^{2}T \over \partial y^{2}}}  [
{\displaystyle v_{x}{\partial T \over \partial x}+v_{y}{\partial T \over
\partial y}={k \over \rho C_{p}}{\partial ^{2}T \over \partial y^{2}}}]
Mass:                v  x      &#x2202;  c  A     &#x2202; x    +  v  y
&#x2202;  c  A     &#x2202; y    =  D  A B       &#x2202;  2    c  A
&#x2202;  y  2        {\displaystyle v_{x}{\partial c_{A} \over \partial x}+v_
{y}{\partial c_{A} \over \partial y}=D_{AB}{\partial ^{2}c_{A} \over \partial
y^{2}}}  [v_{x}{\partial c_{A} \over \partial x}+v_{y}{\partial c_{A} \over
\partial y}=D_{AB}{\partial ^{2}c_{A} \over \partial y^{2}}]
For the momentum balance, kinematic viscosity     &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle \nu
}  [\nu ] can be considered to be the momentum diffusivity. In the energy
balance this is replaced by thermal diffusivity     &#x03B1; =  k  /  &#x03C1;
C  P      {\displaystyle \alpha ={k/\rho C_{P}}}  [\alpha ={k/\rho C_{P}}], and
by mass diffusivity      D  A B     {\displaystyle D_{AB}}  [D_{{AB}}] in the
mass balance. In thermal diffusivity of a substance,     k   {\displaystyle k}
[k] is its thermal conductivity,     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ]
is its density and      C  P     {\displaystyle C_{P}}  [C_{P}] is its heat
capacity. Subscript AB denotes diffusivity of species A diffusing into species
B.
Under the assumption that     &#x03B1; =  D  A B   = &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle
\alpha =D_{AB}=\nu }  [\alpha =D_{AB}=\nu ], these equations become equivalent
to the momentum balance. Thus, for Prandtl number     P r = &#x03BD;  /
&#x03B1; = 1   {\displaystyle Pr=\nu /\alpha =1}  [Pr=\nu /\alpha =1] and
Schmidt number     S c = &#x03BD;  /   D  A B   = 1   {\displaystyle Sc=\nu /D_
{AB}=1}  [Sc=\nu /D_{AB}=1] the Blasius solution applies directly.
Accordingly, this derivation uses a related form of the boundary conditions,

We are given the following relations for heat/mass flux out of the surface of

           (    &#x2202; T   &#x2202; y    )   y = 0   = 0.332     T  &#x221E;

where      &#x03B4;  T   ,  &#x03B4;  c     {\displaystyle \delta _{T},\delta _

Because the Prandtl number of a particular fluid is not often unity, German
engineer E. Polhausen who worked with Ludwig_Prandtl attempted to empirically
extend these equations to apply for     P r &#x2260; 1   {\displaystyle Pr\neq
1}  [Pr\neq 1]. His results can be applied to     S c   {\displaystyle Sc}
[Sc] as well.[23] He found that for Prandtl number greater than 0.6, the
thermal_boundary_layer_thickness was approximately given by:
[Prandtl_number_affects_the_thickness_of_the_Thermal_boundary_layer._When_the
Prandtl_is_less_than_1,_the_thermal_layer_is_larger_than_the_velocity._For

Velocity boundary layer (in red) for various Prandtl Numbers. For     P r = 1
{\displaystyle Pr=1}  [Pr=1], the two are equal.
           &#x03B4;  &#x03B4;  T     = P  r  1  /  3     {\displaystyle {\delta

      3}]          and therefore                &#x03B4;  &#x03B4;  c     = S
      c  1  /  3     {\displaystyle {\delta \over \delta _{c}}=Sc^{1/3}}  [
      {\delta  \over \delta _{c}}=Sc^{1/3}]
From this solution, it is possible to characterize the convective heat/mass
transfer constants based on the region of boundary layer flow. Fourierâs_law
of_conduction and Newtonâs_Law_of_Cooling are combined with the flux term
derived above and the boundary layer thickness.
           q A   = &#x2212; k   (    &#x2202; T   &#x2202; y    )   y = 0   =

      k\left({\partial T \over \partial y}\right)_{y=0}=h_{x}(T_{S}-T_{\infty

This gives the local convective constant      h  x     {\displaystyle h_{x}}
[h_{x}] at one point on the semi-infinite plane. Integrating over the length of
the plate gives an average
          h  L   = 0.664   k x   R  e  L   1  /  2   P  r  1  /  3

Following the derivation with mass transfer terms (    k   {\displaystyle k}
[k] = convective mass transfer constant,      D  A B     {\displaystyle D_{AB}}
[D_{{AB}}] = diffusivity of species A into species B,     S c = &#x03BD;  /   D
A B     {\displaystyle Sc=\nu /D_{AB}}  [Sc=\nu /D_{AB}] ), the following
solutions are obtained:
          k  x  &#x2032;  = 0.332    D  A B   x   R  e  x   1  /  2   S  c  1
      /  3     {\displaystyle k'_{x}=0.332{D_{AB} \over x}Re_{x}^{1/2}Sc^{1/3}}
      [k'_{x}=0.332{D_{AB} \over x}Re_{x}^{1/2}Sc^{1/3}]
          k  L  &#x2032;  = 0.664    D  A B   x   R  e  L   1  /  2   S  c  1
      /  3     {\displaystyle k'_{L}=0.664{D_{AB} \over x}Re_{L}^{1/2}Sc^{1/3}}
      [k'_{L}=0.664{D_{AB} \over x}Re_{L}^{1/2}Sc^{1/3}]
These solutions apply for laminar flow with a Prandtl/Schmidt number greater
than 0.6.[22]
***** Naval architecture[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (April
         2009)
Many of the principles that apply to aircraft also apply to ships, submarines,
and offshore platforms.
For ships, unlike aircraft, one deals with incompressible flows, where change
in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa leads to a
change of only 2â3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called
hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for
strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation
become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear
stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in
which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.

***** Boundary layer turbine[edit] *****
This effect was exploited in the Tesla_turbine, patented by Nikola_Tesla in
1913. It is referred to as a bladeless turbine because it uses the boundary
layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional
turbine. Boundary layer turbines are also known as cohesion-type turbine,
bladeless turbine, and Prandtl layer turbine (after Ludwig_Prandtl).
***** Predicting transient boundary layer thickness in a cylinder using
dimensional analysis[edit] *****
By using the transient and viscous force equations for a cylindrical flow you
can predict the transient boundary layer thickness by finding the Womersley
Number (     N  w     {\displaystyle N_{w}}  [N_{w}]).
Transient Force =     &#x03C1; v w   {\displaystyle \rho vw}  [\rho vw]
Viscous Force =        &#x03BC; v   &#x03B4;  1   2       {\displaystyle {\mu v
\over \delta _{1}^{2}}}  [{\displaystyle {\mu v \over \delta _{1}^{2}}}]
Setting them equal to each other gives:
         &#x03C1; v w =    &#x03BC; v   &#x03B4;  1   2       {\displaystyle
      \rho vw={\mu v \over \delta _{1}^{2}}}  [{\displaystyle \rho vw={\mu v
      \over \delta _{1}^{2}}}]
Solving for delta gives:
          &#x03B4;  1   =    &#x03BC;  &#x03C1; w     =     &#xA0; v   &#xA0; w

In dimensionless form:
           L  &#x03B4;  1     =  L    w  &#xA0; v      =  N  w
      {\displaystyle {L \over \delta _{1}}={L{\sqrt {w \over \ v}}}=N_{w}}  [{L

***** Predicting convective flow conditions at the boundary layer in a cylinder
using dimensional analysis[edit] *****
By using the convective and viscous force equations at the boundary layer for a
cylindrical flow you can predict the convective flow conditions at the boundary
layer by finding the dimensionless Reynolds Number (     N  R
{\displaystyle N_{R}}  [N_{R}]).
Convective force:      &#x03C1;  v  2     &#xA0; L    {\displaystyle \rho v^{2}
\over \ L}  [{\displaystyle \rho v^{2} \over \ L}]
Viscous force:        &#x03BC; v   &#x03B4;  2   2       {\displaystyle {\mu v
\over \delta _{2}^{2}}}  [{\displaystyle {\mu v \over \delta _{2}^{2}}}]
Setting them equal to each other gives:
            &#x03C1;  v  2     &#xA0; L    =    &#x03BC; v   &#x03B4;  2   2
      {\displaystyle {\rho v^{2} \over \ L}={\mu v \over \delta _{2}^{2}}}  [
      {\rho v^{2} \over \ L}={\mu v \over \delta _{2}^{2}}]
Solving for delta gives:
          &#x03B4;  2   =     &#x03BC; L   &#x03C1; v       {\displaystyle
      \delta _{2}={\sqrt {\mu L \over \rho v}}}  [\delta _{2}={\sqrt {\mu L
      \over \rho v}}]
In dimensionless form:
           L  &#x03B4;  2     =     &#x03C1; v L  &#x03BC;    =    N  R
      {\displaystyle {L \over \delta _{2}}={\sqrt {\rho vL \over \mu }}={\sqrt
      {N_{R}}}}  [{L \over \delta _{2}}={\sqrt {\rho vL \over \mu }}={\sqrt {N_
      {R}}}]
where      N  R     {\displaystyle N_{R}}  [N_{R}] = Reynolds Number;
&#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] = density;     v   {\displaystyle v}
[v] = velocity;      &#x03B4;  2     {\displaystyle \delta _{2}}  [\delta _{2}]
= length of convective boundary layer;     &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \mu }
[\mu ] = viscosity;     L   {\displaystyle L}  [L] = characteristic length.
***** Boundary layer ingestion[edit] *****
Boundary layer ingestion promises an increase in aircraft_fuel_efficiency with
an aft-mounted propulsor ingesting the slow fuselage boundary layer and re-
energising the wake to reduce drag and improve propulsive_efficiency. To
operate in distorted airflow, the fan is heavier and its efficiency is reduced,
and its integration is challenging. It is used in concepts like the Aurora_D8
or the French research agency Oneraâs Nova, saving 5% in cruise by ingesting
40% of the fuselage boundary layer.[24]
Airbus presented the Nautilius concept at the ICAS congress in September 2018:
to ingest all the fuselage boundary layer, while minimizing the azimuthal flow
distortion, the fuselage splits into two spindles with 13-18:1 bypass_ratio
fans. Propulsive efficiencies are up to 90% like counter-rotating open_rotors
with smaller, lighter, less complex and noisy engines. It could lower fuel burn
by over 10% compared to an usual underwing 15:1 bypass ratio engine.[24]
