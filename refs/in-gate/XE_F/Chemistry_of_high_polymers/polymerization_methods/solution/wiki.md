A homogeneous mixture which assumes the phase of the solvent
This article is about chemical solutions. For other uses, see Solution_
(disambiguation).

Making a saline_water solution by dissolving table_salt (NaCl) in water. The
salt is the solute and the water the solvent.
In chemistry, a solution is a special type of homogeneous_mixture composed of
two or more substances. In such a mixture, a solute is a substance dissolved in
another substance, known as a solvent. The mixing process of a solution happens
at a scale where the effects of chemical_polarity are involved, resulting in
interactions that are specific to solvation. The solution assumes the phase of
the solvent when the solvent is the larger fraction of the mixture, as is
commonly the case. The concentration of a solute in a solution is the mass of
that solute expressed as a percentage of the mass of the whole solution. The
term aqueous_solution is when one of the solvents is water.[1]

***** Characteristics *****
    * A solution is a homogeneous_mixture of two or more substances.
    * The particles of solute in a solution cannot be seen by the naked eye.
    * A solution does not allow beams of light to scatter.
    * A solution is stable.
    * The solute from a solution cannot be separated by filtration (or
      mechanically).
    * It is composed of only one phase.
***** Types *****

Homogeneous means that the components of the mixture form a single phase.
Heterogeneous means that the components of the mixture are of different phase.
The properties of the mixture (such as concentration, temperature, and density)
can be uniformly distributed through the volume but only in absence of
diffusion phenomena or after their completion. Usually, the substance present
in the greatest amount is considered the solvent. Solvents can be gases,
liquids or solids. One or more components present in the solution other than
the solvent are called solutes. The solution has the same physical_state as the
solvent.
**** Gaseous solutions ****
If the solvent is a gas, only gases are dissolved under a given set of
conditions. An example of a gaseous solution is air (oxygen and other gases
dissolved in nitrogen). Since interactions between molecules play almost no
role, dilute gases form rather trivial solutions. In part of the literature,
they are not even classified as solutions, but addressed as mixtures.
**** Liquid solutions ****
If the solvent is a liquid, then almost all gases, liquids, and solids can be
dissolved. Here are some examples:
    * Gas in liquid:
          o Oxygen in water
          o Carbon_dioxide in water â a less simple example, because the
            solution is accompanied by a chemical reaction (formation of ions).
            Note also that the visible bubbles in carbonated_water are not the
            dissolved gas, but only an effervescence of carbon dioxide that has
            come out of solution; the dissolved gas itself is not visible since
            it is dissolved on a molecular level.
    * Liquid in liquid:
          o The mixing of two or more substances of the same chemistry but
            different concentrations to form a constant. (Homogenization of
            solutions)
          o Alcoholic beverages are basically solutions of ethanol in water.
    * Solid in liquid:
          o Sucrose (table sugar) in water
          o Sodium_chloride (NaCl) (table salt) or any other salt in water,
            which forms an electrolyte: When dissolving, salt dissociates into
            ions.
    * Solutions_in_water are especially common, and are called aqueous
      solutions.
    * Non-aqueous solutions are when the liquid solvent involved is not water.
      [1]
Counter examples are provided by liquid mixtures that are not homogeneous:
colloids, suspensions, emulsions are not considered solutions.
Body_fluids are examples for complex liquid solutions, containing many solutes.
Many of these are electrolytes, since they contain solute ions, such as
potassium. Furthermore, they contain solute molecules like sugar and urea.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide are also essential components of blood_chemistry,
where significant changes in their concentrations may be a sign of severe
illness or injury.
**** Solid solutions ****
If the solvent is a solid, then gases, liquids and solids can be dissolved.
    * Gas in solids:
          o Hydrogen dissolves rather well in metals, especially in palladium;
            this is studied as a means of hydrogen_storage.
    * Liquid in solid:
          o Mercury in gold, forming an amalgam
          o Water in solid salt or sugar, forming moist solids
          o Hexane in paraffin_wax
    * Solid in solid:
          o Steel, basically a solution of carbon atoms in a crystalline matrix
            of iron atoms
          o Alloys like bronze and many others
          o Polymers containing plasticizers
***** Solubility *****
Main articles: Solubility and Solvation
The ability of one compound to dissolve in another compound is called
solubility. When a liquid can completely dissolve in another liquid the two
liquids are miscible. Two substances that can never mix to form a solution are
said to be immiscible.
All solutions have a positive entropy of mixing. The interactions between
different molecules or ions may be energetically favored or not. If
interactions are unfavorable, then the free_energy decreases with increasing
solute concentration. At some point the energy loss outweighs the entropy gain,
and no more solute particles can be dissolved; the solution is said to be
saturated. However, the point at which a solution can become saturated can
change significantly with different environmental factors, such as temperature,
pressure, and contamination. For some solute-solvent combinations a
supersaturated solution can be prepared by raising the solubility (for example
by increasing the temperature) to dissolve more solute, and then lowering it
(for example by cooling).
Usually, the greater the temperature of the solvent, the more of a given solid
solute it can dissolve. However, most gases and some compounds exhibit
solubilities that decrease with increased temperature. Such behavior is a
result of an exothermic enthalpy_of_solution. Some surfactants exhibit this
behaviour. The solubility of liquids in liquids is generally less temperature-
sensitive than that of solids or gases.
***** Properties *****
The physical properties of compounds such as melting_point and boiling_point
change when other compounds are added. Together they are called colligative
properties. There are several ways to quantify the amount of one compound
dissolved in the other compounds collectively called concentration. Examples
include molarity, volume_fraction, and mole_fraction.
The properties of ideal_solutions can be calculated by the linear_combination
of the properties of its components. If both solute and solvent exist in equal
quantities (such as in a 50% ethanol, 50% water solution), the concepts of
"solute" and "solvent" become less relevant, but the substance that is more
often used as a solvent is normally designated as the solvent (in this example,
water).
***** Liquid *****
See also: Solvent_Â§ Solvent_classifications
In principle, all types of liquids can behave as solvents: liquid noble_gases,
molten metals, molten salts, molten covalent networks, and molecular liquids.
In the practice of chemistry and biochemistry, most solvents are molecular
liquids. They can be classified into polar_and_non-polar, according to whether
their molecules possess a permanent electric_dipole_moment. Another distinction
is whether their molecules can form hydrogen_bonds (protic and aprotic
solvents). Water, the most commonly used solvent, is both polar and sustains
hydrogen bonds.
Water is a good solvent because the molecules are polar and capable of forming
hydrogen bonds (1).
Salts dissolve in polar solvents, forming positive and negative ions that are
attracted to the negative and positive ends of the solvent molecule,
respectively. If the solvent is water, hydration occurs when the charged solute
ions become surrounded by water molecules. A standard example is aqueous
saltwater. Such solutions are called electrolytes. Whenever salt dissolves in
water ion_association has to be taken into account.
Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents, forming polar bonds or hydrogen
bonds. As an example, all alcoholic beverages are aqueous_solutions of ethanol.
On the other hand, non-polar solutes dissolve better in non-polar solvents.
Examples are hydrocarbons such as oil and grease that easily mix with each
other, while being incompatible with water.
An example for the immiscibility of oil and water is a leak of petroleum from a
damaged tanker, that does not dissolve in the ocean water but rather floats on
the surface.
**** Preparation from constituent ingredients ****
It is common practice in laboratories to make a solution directly from its
constituent ingredients. There are three cases in practical calculation:
    * Case 1: amount of solvent volume is given.
    * Case 2: amount of solute mass is given.
    * Case 3: amount of final solution volume is given.
In the following equations, A is solvent, B is solute, and C is concentration.
Solute volume contribution is considered through ideal solution model.
    * Case 1: amount (mL) of solvent volume VA is given. Solute mass mB = C VA
      dA /(100-C/dB)
    * Case 2: amount of solute mass mB is given. Solvent volume VA = mB (100/C-
      1/ dB )
    * Case 3: amount (mL) of final solution volume Vt is given. Solute mass mB
      = C Vt /100; Solvent volume VA=(100/C-1/ dB) mB
    * Case 2: solute mass is known, VA = mB 100/C
    * Case 3: total solution volume is known, same equation as case 1. VA=Vt;
      mB = C VA /100
Example: Make 2 g/100mL of NaCl solution with 1 L water Water_(properties). The
density of resulting solution is considered to be equal to that of water,
statement holding especially for dilute solutions, so the density information
is not required.
      mB = C VA = ( 2 / 100 ) g/mL × 1000 mL = 20 g

      water quality, it refers to the amount of residue remaining after
      evaporation of water from a sample.
