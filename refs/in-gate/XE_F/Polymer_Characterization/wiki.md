Polymer characterization is the analytical branch of polymer_science.
The discipline is concerned with the characterization of polymeric materials on
a variety of levels. The characterization typically has as a goal to improve
the performance of the material. As such, many characterization techniques
should ideally be linked to the desirable properties of the material such as
strength, impermeability, thermal stability, and optical properties.[1]
Characterization techniques are typically used to determine molecular_mass,
molecular structure, morphology, thermal properties, and mechanical properties.

***** Molecular mass[edit] *****
The molecular mass of a polymer differs from typical molecules, in that
polymerization reactions produce a distribution of molecular weights and
shapes. The distribution of molecular masses can be summarized by the number
average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity.
Some of the most common methods for determining these parameters are
colligative_property measurements, static_light_scattering techniques,
viscometry, and size_exclusion_chromatography.
Gel_permeation_chromatography, a type of size exclusion chromatography, is an
especially useful technique used to directly determine the molecular weight
distribution parameters based on the polymer's hydrodynamic_volume. Gel
permeation chromatography is often used in combination with multi-angle_light
scattering (MALS), Low-angle_laser_light_scattering (LALLS) and/or viscometry
for an absolute determination (i.e., independent of the chromatographic
separation details) of the molecular weight distribution as well as the
branching ratio and degree of long chain branching of a polymer, provided a
suitable solvent can be found.[3]
Molar mass determination of copolymers is a much more complicated procedure.
The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the homopolymers and how
this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically
requires multiple characterization methods. For instance, copolymers with short
chain branching such as linear_low-density_polyethylene (a copolymer of
ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or octene) require the use of
Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (ATREF) techniques. These
techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the
various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular
mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection
system comprising multi-angle_light_scattering, UV absorption and differential
refractometry, if the copolymer is composed of two base polymers that provide
different responses to UV and/or refractive index.[4]
***** Molecular structure[edit] *****
Many of the analytical techniques used to determine the molecular structure of
unknown organic compounds are also used in polymer characterization.
Spectroscopic techniques such as ultraviolet-visible_spectroscopy, infrared
spectroscopy, Raman_spectroscopy, nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy,
electron_spin_resonance_spectroscopy, X-ray_diffraction, and mass_spectrometry
are used to identify common functional groups.
***** Morphology[edit] *****
Polymer morphology is a microscale property that is largely dictated by the
amorphous or crystalline portions of the polymer chains and their influence on
each other. Microscopy techniques are especially useful in determining these
microscale properties, as the domains created by the polymer morphology are
large enough to be viewed using modern microscopy instruments. Some of the most
common microscopy techniques used are X-ray_diffraction, Transmission_Electron
Microscopy, Scanning_Transmission_Electron_Microscopy, Scanning_Electron
Microscopy, and Atomic_Force_Microscopy.
Polymer morphology on a mesoscale (nanometers to micrometers) is particularly
important for the mechanical properties of many materials. Transmission
Electron_Microscopy in combination with staining techniques, but also Scanning
Electron_Microscopy, Scanning_probe_microscopy are important tools to optimize
the morphology of materials like polybutadiene-polystyrene polymers and many
polymer blends.
X-ray_diffraction is generally not as powerful for this class of materials as
they are either amorphous or poorly crystallized. The Small-angle_scattering
like Small-angle_X-ray_scattering (SAXS) can be used to measure the long
periods of semicrystalline polymers.
***** Thermal properties[edit] *****
A true workhorse for polymer characterization is thermal_analysis, particularly
Differential_scanning_calorimetry. Changes in the compositional and structural
parameters of the material usually affect its melting transitions or glass
transitions and these in turn can be linked to many performance parameters. For
semicrystalline polymers it is an important method to measure crystallinity.
Thermogravimetric_analysis can also give an indication of polymer thermal
stability and the effects of additives such as flame retardants. Other thermal
analysis techniques are typically combinations of the basic techniques and
include differential_thermal_analysis, thermomechanical_analysis, dynamic
mechanical thermal analysis, and dielectric_thermal_analysis.
Dynamic_mechanical_spectroscopy and dielectric_spectroscopy are essentially
extensions of thermal analysis that can reveal more subtle transitions with
temperature as they affect the complex modulus or the dielectric function of
the material.
***** Mechanical properties[edit] *****
The characterization of mechanical properties in polymers typically refers to a
measure of the strength, elasticity, viscoelasticity, and anisotropy of a
polymeric material. The mechanical properties of a polymer are strongly
dependent upon the Van_der_Waals interactions of the polymer chains, and the
ability of the chains to elongate and align in the direction of the applied
force. Other phenomena, such as the propensity of polymers to form crazes can
impact the mechanical properties. Typically, polymeric materials are
characterized as elastomers, plastics, or rigid polymers depending their
mechanical properties.[5]
The tensile_strength, yield_strength, and Young's_modulus are measures of
strength and elasticity, and are of particular interest for describing the
stress-strain properties of polymeric materials. These properties can be
measure through tensile testing.[6] For crystalline or semicrystalline
polymers, anisotropy plays a large role in the mechanical properties of the
polymer.[7] The crystallinity of the polymer can be measured through
differential_scanning_calorimetry.[8] For amorphous and semicrystalline
polymers, as stress is applied, the polymer chains are able to disentangle and
align. If the stress is applied in the direction of chain alignment, the
polymer chains will exhibit a higher yield stress and strength, as the covalent
bonds connecting the backbone of the polymer absorb the stress. However, if the
stress is applied normal to the direction of chain alignment, the Van der Waals
interactions between chains will primarily be responsible for the mechanical
properties and thus, the yield stress will decrease.[9] This would be
observable in a stress strain graph found through tensile testing. Sample
preparation, including chain orientation within the sample, for tensile tests
therefore can play a large role in the observed mechanical properties.
The fracture properties of crystalline and semicrystalline polymers can be
evaluated with Charpy_impact_testing. Charpy tests, which can also be used with
alloy systems, are performed by creating a notch in the sample, and then using
a pendulum to fracture the sample at the notch. The pendulumâs motion can be
used to extrapolate the energy absorbed by the sample to fracture it. Charpy
tests can also be used to evaluate the strain rate on the fracture, as measured
with changes in the pendulum mass. Typically, only brittle and somewhat ductile
polymers are evaluated with Charpy tests. In addition to the fracture energy,
the type of break can be visually evaluated, as in whether the break was a
total fracture of the sample or whether the sample experienced fracture in only
part of the sample, and severely deformed section are still connected.
Elastomers are typically not evaluated with Charpy tests due to their high
yield strain inhibiting the Charpy test results.[10]
There are many properties of polymeric materials that influence their
mechanical properties. As the degree of polymerization goes up, so does the
polymerâs strength, as a longer chains have high Van der Waals interactions
and chain entanglement. Long polymers can entangle, which leads to a subsequent
increase in bulk modulus.[11] Crazes are small cracks that form in a polymer
matrix, but which are stopped by small defects in the polymer matrix. These
defects are typically made up of a second, low modulus polymer that is
dispersed throughout the primary phase. The crazes can increase the strength
and decrease the brittleness of a polymer by allowing the small cracks to
absorb higher stress and strain without leading to fracture. If crazes are
allowed to propagate or coalesce, they can lead to cavitation and fracture in
the sample.[12][13] Crazes can be seen with transmission electron microscopy
and scanning electron microscopy, and are typically engineered into a polymeric
material during synthesis. Crosslinking, typically seen in thermoset polymers,
can also increase the modulus, yield stress, and yield strength of a polymer.
[14]
Dynamic_mechanical_analysis is the most common technique used to characterize
viscoelastic behavior common in many polymeric systems.[15] DMA is also another
important tool to understand the temperature dependence of polymersâ
mechanical behavior. Dynamic mechanical analysis is a characterization
technique used to measure storage modulus and glass transition temperature,
confirm crosslinking, determine switching temperatures in shape-memory
polymers, monitor cures in thermosets, and determine molecular weight. An
oscillating force is applied to a polymer sample and the sampleâs response is
recorded. DMA documents the lag between force applied and deformation recovery
in the sample. Viscoelastic samples exhibit a sinusoidal modulus called the
dynamic_modulus. Both energy recovered and lost are considered during each
deformation and described quantitatively by the elastic modulus (Eâ) and the
loss modulus (Eââ) respectively. The applied stress and the strain on the
sample exhibit a phase difference, áº, which is measured over time. A new
modulus is calculated each time stress is applied to the material, so DMA is
used to study changes in modulus at various temperatures or stress frequencies.
