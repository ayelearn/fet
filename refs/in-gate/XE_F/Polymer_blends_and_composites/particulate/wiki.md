Atmospheric aerosol particles â also known as atmospheric particulate matter,
particulate matter (PM), particulates, or suspended particulate matter (SPM)
â are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the atmosphere_of
Earth. The term aerosol commonly refers to the particulate/air mixture, as
opposed to the particulate matter alone.[3] Sources of particulate matter can
be natural or anthropogenic.[4] They have impacts on climate and precipitation
that adversely affect human health, in addition to direct inhalation.
Subtypes of atmospheric particles include suspended particulate matter (SPM),
thoracic and respirable particles,[5] inhalable coarse particles, which are
coarse particles with a diameter between 2.5 and 10 micrometers (Î¼m) (PM10),
[6] fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 Î¼m or less[6] (PM2.5),[7] ultrafine
particles, and soot.
The IARC and WHO designate airborne particulates a Group_1_carcinogen.[8]
Particulates are the most harmful form of air_pollution[9] due to their ability
to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered, causing
permanent DNA mutations, heart_attacks, respiratory_disease, and premature
death.[10] In 2013, a study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries
revealed that there was no safe level of particulates and that for every
increase of 10 Î¼g/m3 in PM10, the lung_cancer rate rose 22%. The smaller PM2.5
were particularly deadly, with a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 Î¼g/m3 as
it can penetrate deeper into the lungs.[11] Worldwide exposure to PM2.5
contributed to 4.1 million deaths from heart disease and stroke, lung cancer,
chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections in 2016.[12] Overall, ambient
particulate matter ranks as the sixth leading risk factor for premature death
globally.[13]

***** Sources of atmospheric particulate matter[edit] *****
Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust_storms,
forest and grassland fires, living vegetation and sea_spray. Human activities,
such as the burning of fossil_fuels in vehicles,[14] stubble_burning, power
plants, wet cooling_towers in cooling systems and various industrial processes,
also generate significant amounts of particulates. Coal combustion in
developing countries is the primary method for heating homes and supplying
energy. Because salt spray over the oceans is the overwhelmingly most common
form of particulate in the atmosphere, anthropogenic aerosolsâthose made by
human activitiesâcurrently account for about 10 percent of the total mass of
aerosols in our atmosphere.[15]
***** Composition[edit] *****
Further information: particulate_organic_matter
The composition of aerosols and particles depends on their source. Wind-blown
mineral_dust[16] tends to be made of mineral oxides and other material blown
from the Earth's_crust; this particulate is light-absorbing.[17] Sea salt[18]
is considered the second-largest contributor in the global aerosol budget, and
consists mainly of sodium_chloride originated from sea spray; other
constituents of atmospheric sea salt reflect the composition of sea_water, and
thus include magnesium, sulfate, calcium, potassium, etc. In addition, sea
spray aerosols may contain organic compounds, which influence their chemistry.
The drift/mist emissions from the wet cooling_towers is also source of
particulate matter as they are widely used in industry and other sectors for
dissipating heat in cooling systems.[19]
Secondary particles derive from the oxidation of primary gases such as sulfur
and nitrogen_oxides into sulfuric_acid (liquid) and nitric_acid (gaseous). The
precursors for these aerosolsâi.e. the gases from which they originateâmay
have an anthropogenic origin (from fossil fuel or coal combustion) and a
natural biogenic origin. In the presence of ammonia, secondary aerosols often
take the form of ammonium salts; i.e. ammonium_sulfate and ammonium_nitrate
(both can be dry or in aqueous solution); in the absence of ammonia, secondary
compounds take an acidic form as sulfuric acid (liquid aerosol droplets) and
nitric acid (atmospheric gas), all of which may contribute to the health
effects of particulates.[20]
Secondary sulfate and nitrate aerosols are strong light-scatterers.[21] This is
mainly because the presence of sulfate and nitrate causes the aerosols to
increase to a size that scatters light effectively.
Organic_matter (OM) can be either primary or secondary, the latter part
deriving from the oxidation of VOCs; organic material in the atmosphere may
either be biogenic or anthropogenic. Organic matter influences the atmospheric
radiation field by both scattering and absorption. Another important aerosol
type is elemental_carbon (EC, also known as black_carbon, BC): this aerosol
type includes strongly light-absorbing material and is thought to yield large
positive radiative_forcing. Organic matter and elemental carbon together
constitute the carbonaceous fraction of aerosols.[22] Secondary organic
aerosols (SOAs), tiny "tar balls" resulting from combustion products of
internal combustion engines, have been identified as a danger to health.[23]
The chemical composition of the aerosol directly affects how it interacts with
solar radiation. The chemical constituents within the aerosol change the
overall refractive_index. The refractive index will determine how much light is
scattered and absorbed.
The composition of particulate matter that generally causes visual effects such
as smog consists of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, mineral
dust, organic matter, and elemental carbon also known as black carbon or soot.
The particles are hygroscopic due to the presence of sulfur, and SO2 is
converted to sulfate when high humidity and low temperatures are present. This
causes the reduced visibility and yellow color.[24]
***** Size distribution of particulates[edit] *****
Further information: Â§ Size,_shape_and_solubility_matter
Aerosol particles of natural origin (such as windblown dust) tend to have a
larger radius than human-produced aerosols such as particle_pollution.[15] The
false-color maps in the third image on this page show where there are natural
aerosols, human pollution, or a mixture of both, monthly.
Among the most obvious patterns that the size distribution time series shows is
that in the planet's most southerly latitudes, nearly all the aerosols are
large, but in the high northern latitudes, smaller aerosols are very abundant.
Most of the Southern Hemisphere is covered by ocean, where the largest source
of aerosols is natural sea salt from dried sea spray. Because the land is
concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, the amount of small aerosols from
fires and human activities is greater there than in the Southern Hemisphere.
Over land, patches of large-radius aerosols appear over deserts and arid
regions, most prominently, the Sahara_Desert in North Africa and the Arabian
Peninsula, where dust storms are common. Places where human-triggered or
natural fire activity is common (land-clearing fires in the Amazon from
AugustâOctober, for example, or lightning-triggered fires in the forests of
northern Canada in Northern Hemisphere summer) are dominated by smaller
aerosols. Human-produced (fossil fuel) pollution is largely responsible for the
areas of small aerosols over developed areas such as the eastern United States
and Europe, especially in their summer.[25][better source needed]
Satellite measurements of aerosols, called aerosol optical thickness, are based
on the fact that the particles change the way the atmosphere reflects and
absorbs visible and infrared light. As shown in the seventh image on this page,
an optical thickness of less than 0.1 (palest yellow) indicates a crystal clear
sky with maximum visibility, whereas a value of 1 (reddish brown) indicates
very hazy conditions.[26][better source needed]

Main article: Deposition_(aerosol_physics)
In general, the smaller and lighter a particle is, the longer it will stay in
the air. Larger particles (greater than 10 micrometers in diameter) tend to
settle to the ground by gravity in a matter of hours whereas the smallest
particles (less than 1 micrometer) can stay in the atmosphere for weeks and are
mostly removed by precipitation. Diesel_particulate_matter is highest near the
source of emission.[27] Any info regarding DPM and the atmosphere, flora,
height, and distance from major sources would be useful to determine health
effects.
***** Controlling technologies[edit] *****
Main article: Dust_collector
A complicated blend of solid and liquid particles result in particulate_matter
and these particulate matter emissions are highly regulated in most
industrialized countries. Due to environmental_concerns, most industries are
required to operate some kind of dust collection system to control particulate
emissions.[28] These systems include inertial collectors (cyclonic_separators),
fabric filter collectors (baghouses), wet_scrubbers, and electrostatic
precipitators.
Cyclonic separators are useful for removing large, coarse particles and are
often employed as a first step or "pre-cleaner" to other more efficient
collectors. Well-designed cyclonic separators can be very efficient in removing
even fine particulates, and may be operated continuously without requiring
frequent shutdowns for maintenance.[29]
Fabric_filters or baghouses are the most commonly employed in general industry.
[30] They work by forcing dust laden air through a bag shaped fabric filter
leaving the particulate to collect on the outer surface of the bag and allowing
the now clean air to pass through to either be exhausted into the atmosphere or
in some cases recirculated into the facility. Common fabrics include polyester
and fiberglass and common fabric coatings include PTFE (commonly known as
Teflon). The excess dust buildup is then cleaned from the bags and removed from
the collector.
Wet scrubbers pass the dirty air through a scrubbing solution (usually a
mixture of water and other compounds) allowing the particulate to attach to the
liquid molecules. Electrostatic precipitators electrically charge the dirty air
as it passes through. The now charged air then passes through large
electrostatic plates which attract the charged particle in the airstream
collecting them and leaving the now clean air to be exhausted or recirculated.
Besides removing particulates from the source of the pollution, it can also be
cleaned in the open air.
***** Climate effects[edit] *****
2005 radiative forcings and uncertainties as estimated by the IPCC.
Atmospheric aerosols affect the climate of the earth by changing the amount of
incoming solar_radiation and outgoing terrestrial longwave radiation retained
in the earth's system. This occurs through several distinct mechanisms which
are split into direct, indirect[31][32] and semi-direct aerosol effects. The
aerosol climate effects are the biggest source of uncertainty in future climate
predictions.[33] The Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change, Third
Assessment Report, says: While the radiative forcing due to greenhouse_gases
may be determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy... the uncertainties
relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large, and rely to a large extent
on the estimates from global modelling studies that are difficult to verify at
the present time.[34]
**** Aerosol radiative effects[edit] ****

brown) indicates the relative amount of particles that absorb sunlight.

These maps show average monthly aerosol amounts around the world based on
observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on
NASA's Terra satellite.
*** Direct effect[edit] ***
Particulates in the air causing shades of grey and pink in Mumbai during sunset
The direct aerosol effect consists of any direct interaction of radiation with
atmospheric aerosols, such as absorption or scattering. It affects both short
and longwave radiation to produce a net negative radiative forcing.[35] The
magnitude of the resultant radiative forcing due to the direct effect of an
aerosol is dependent on the albedo of the underlying surface, as this affects
the net amount of radiation absorbed or scattered to space. e.g. if a highly
scattering aerosol is above a surface of low albedo it has a greater radiative
forcing than if it was above a surface of high albedo. The converse is true of
absorbing aerosol, with the greatest radiative forcing arising from a highly
absorbing aerosol over a surface of high albedo.[31] The direct aerosol effect
is a first order effect and is therefore classified as a radiative forcing by
the IPCC.[33] The interaction of an aerosol with radiation is quantified by the
single-scattering_albedo (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering
plus absorption (extinction) of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity
if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as
absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, the
sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas
soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol
absorber.
*** Indirect effect[edit] ***
The Indirect aerosol effect consists of any change to the earth's radiative
budget due to the modification of clouds by atmospheric aerosols, and consists
of several distinct effects. Cloud droplets form onto pre-existing aerosol
particles, known as cloud_condensation_nuclei (CCN).
For any given meteorological conditions, an increase in CCN leads to an
increase in the number of cloud droplets. This leads to more scattering of
shortwave radiation i.e. an increase in the albedo of the cloud, known as the
Cloud albedo effect, First indirect effect or Twomey_effect.[32] Evidence
supporting the cloud albedo effect has been observed from the effects of ship
exhaust plumes[36] and biomass_burning[37] on cloud albedo compared to ambient
clouds. The Cloud albedo aerosol effect is a first order effect and therefore
classified as a radiative forcing by the IPCC.[33]
An increase in cloud droplet number due to the introduction of aerosol acts to
reduce the cloud droplet size, as the same amount of water is divided into more
droplets. This has the effect of suppressing precipitation, increasing the
cloud lifetime, known as the cloud lifetime aerosol effect, second indirect
effect or Albrecht effect.[33] This has been observed as the suppression of
drizzle in ship exhaust plume compared to ambient clouds,[38] and inhibited
precipitation in biomass burning plumes.[39] This cloud lifetime effect is
classified as a climate feedback (rather than a radiative forcing) by the IPCC
due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle.[33] However,
it has previously been classified as a negative radiative forcing.[40]
*** Semi-direct effect[edit] ***
The Semi-direct effect concerns any radiative effect caused by absorbing
atmospheric aerosol such as soot, apart from direct scattering and absorption,
which is classified as the direct effect. It encompasses many individual
mechanisms, and in general is more poorly defined and understood than the
direct and indirect aerosol effects. For instance, if absorbing aerosols are
present in a layer aloft in the atmosphere, they can heat surrounding air which
inhibits the condensation of water vapour, resulting in less cloud formation.
[41] Additionally, heating a layer of the atmosphere relative to the surface
results in a more stable atmosphere due to the inhibition of atmospheric
convection. This inhibits the convective uplift of moisture,[42] which in turn
reduces cloud formation. The heating of the atmosphere aloft also leads to a
cooling of the surface, resulting in less evaporation of surface water. The
effects described here all lead to a reduction in cloud cover i.e. an increase
in planetary albedo. The semi-direct effect classified as a climate feedback)
by the IPCC due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle.
[33] However, it has previously been classified as a negative radiative
forcing.[40]
**** Roles of different aerosol species[edit] ****
*** Sulfate aerosol[edit] ***
Main article: stratospheric_sulfur_aerosols
Sulfate aerosol has two main effects, direct and indirect. The direct effect,
via albedo, is a cooling effect that slows the overall rate of global_warming:
the IPCC's best estimate of the radiative forcing is â0.4 watts per square
meter with a range of â0.2 to â0.8 W/mÂ²[43] but there are substantial
uncertainties. The effect varies strongly geographically, with most cooling
believed to be at and downwind of major industrial centres. Modern climate
models addressing the attribution_of_recent_climate_change take into account
sulfate forcing, which appears to account (at least partly) for the slight drop
in global temperature in the middle of the 20th century. The indirect effect
(via the aerosol acting as cloud condensation nuclei, CCN, and thereby
modifying the cloud properties -albedo and lifetime-) is more uncertain but is
believed to be a cooling.
*** Black carbon[edit] ***
Black carbon (BC), or carbon black, or elemental carbon (EC), often called
soot, is composed of pure carbon clusters, skeleton balls and buckyballs, and
is one of the most important absorbing aerosol species in the atmosphere. It
should be distinguished from organic carbon (OC): clustered or aggregated
organic molecules on their own or permeating an EC buckyball. BC from fossil
fuels is estimated by the IPCC in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC,
4AR, to contribute a global mean radiative forcing of +0.2 W/mÂ² (was +0.1 W/
mÂ² in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC, SAR), with a range +0.1 to
+0.4 W/mÂ². Bond et al., however, states that "the best estimate for the
industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black
carbon is +0.71 W/mÂ² with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W/mÂ²" with
"total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the
preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W/mÂ²"[44]
**** Instances of aerosol affecting climate[edit] ****
Solar radiation reduction due to volcanic eruptions
Volcanoes are a large natural source of aerosol and have been linked to changes
in the earth's climate often with consequences for the human population.
Eruptions linked to changes in climate include the 1600 eruption of
Huaynaputina which was linked to the Russian_famine_of_1601_-_1603,[45][46][47]
leading to the deaths of two million, and the 1991 eruption of Mount_Pinatubo
which caused a global cooling of approximately 0.5 Â°C lasting several years.
[48][49] Research tracking the effect of light-scattering aerosols in the
stratosphere during 2000 and 2010 and comparing its pattern to volcanic
activity show a close correlation. Simulations of the effect of anthropogenic
particles showed little influence at present levels.[50][51]
Aerosols are also thought to affect weather and climate on a regional scale.
The failure of the Indian Monsoon has been linked to the suppression of
evaporation of water from the Indian Ocean due to the semi-direct effect of
anthropogenic aerosol.[52]
Recent studies of the Sahel_drought[53] and major increases since 1967 in
rainfall over the Northern_Territory, Kimberley, Pilbara and around the
Nullarbor_Plain have led some scientists to conclude that the aerosol haze over
South and East_Asia has been steadily shifting tropical rainfall in both
hemispheres southward.[52][54]
The latest studies of severe rainfall decline over southern_Australia since
1997[55] have led climatologists there to consider the possibility that these
Asian aerosols have shifted not only tropical but also midlatitude systems
southward.

**** Size, shape and solubility matter[edit] ****
The size of the particle is a main determinant of where in the respiratory
tract the particle will come to rest when inhaled. Larger particles are
generally filtered in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus, but particulate
matter smaller than about 10 micrometers, can settle in the bronchi and lungs
and cause health problems. The 10-micrometer size does not represent a strict
boundary between respirable and non-respirable particles, but has been agreed
upon for monitoring of airborne particulate matter by most regulatory agencies.
Because of their small size, particles on the order of 10 micrometers or less
(coarse particulate matter, PM10) can penetrate the deepest part of the lungs
such as the bronchioles or alveoli;[56] when asthmatics are exposed to these
conditions it can trigger bronchoconstriction[57]
Similarly, so called fine particulate matter (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into
the gas_exchange regions of the lung (alveolus), and very small particles
(ultrafine particulate matter, PM0.1) may pass through the lungs to affect
other organs. Penetration of particles is not wholly dependent on their size;
shape and chemical composition also play a part. To avoid this complication,
simple nomenclature is used to indicate the different degrees of relative
penetration of a PM particle into the cardiovascular system. Inhalable
particles penetrate no further than the bronchi as they are filtered out by the
cilia. Thoracic particles can penetrate right into terminal bronchioles whereas
PM0.1, which can penetrate to alveoli, the gas exchange area, and hence the
circulatory_system are termed respirable particles. In analogy, the inhalable
dust fraction is the fraction of dust entering nose and mouth which may be
deposited anywhere in the respiratory tract. The thoracic fraction is the
fraction that enters the thorax and is deposited within the lung's airways. The
respirable fraction is what is deposited in the gas exchange regions (alveoli).
[58]
The smallest particles, less than 100 nanometers (nanoparticles), may be even
more damaging to the cardiovascular system.[59] Nanoparticles can pass through
cell membranes and migrate into other organs, including the brain. Particles
emitted from modern diesel_engines (commonly referred to as Diesel_Particulate
Matter, or DPM) are typically in the size range of 100 nanometers (0.1
micrometer). These soot particles also carry carcinogens like benzopyrenes
adsorbed on their surface. Particulate mass is not a proper measure of the
health hazard, because one particle of 10 Âµm diameter has approximately the
same mass as 1 million particles of 100 nm diameter, but is much less
hazardous, as it is unlikely to enter the alveoli. Legislative limits for
engine emissions based on mass are therefore not protective. Proposals for new
regulations exist in some countries,[which?] with suggestions to limit the
particle surface area or the particle count (numerical quantity) instead.
[citation_needed]
The site and extent of absorption of inhaled gases and vapors are determined by
their solubility in water. Absorption is also dependent upon air flow rates and
the partial pressure of the gases in the inspired air. The fate of a specific
contaminant is dependent upon the form in which it exists (aerosol or
particulate). Inhalation also depends upon the breathing rate of the subject.
[60]
Another complexity not entirely documented is how the shape of PM can affect
health, except for the needle-like shape of asbestos which can lodge itself in
the lungs. Geometrically angular shapes have more surface area than rounder
shapes, which in turn affects the binding capacity of the particle to other,
possibly more dangerous substances.
**** Health problems[edit] ****
Air quality information on PM10 displayed in Katowice, Poland
The effects of inhaling particulate matter that has been widely studied in
humans and animals include asthma, lung cancer, respiratory diseases,
cardiovascular disease, premature_delivery, birth defects, low_birth_weight,
and premature death.
Inhalation of PM2.5 â PM10 is associated with elevated risk of adverse
pregnancy outcomes, such as low_birth_weight .[61] Maternal PM2.5 exposure
during pregnancy is also associated with high blood pressure in children.[62]
Exposure to PM2.5 has been associated with greater reductions in birth weight
than exposure to PM10.[63] PM exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative
stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the
placenta,[64] all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth
weight.[65] Overall epidemiologic and toxicological evidence suggests that a
causal relationship exists between long-term exposures to PM2.5 and
developmental outcomes (i.e. low birth weight).[63] However, studies
investigating the significance of trimester-specific exposure have proven to be
inconclusive,[66] and results of international studies have been inconsistent
in drawing associations of prenatal particulate matter exposure and low birth
weight.[63]  As perinatal outcomes have been associated with lifelong health
[67][68] and exposure to particulate matter is widespread, this issue is of
critical public health importance and additional research will be essential to
inform public policy on the matter.
Increased levels of fine particles in the air as a result of anthropogenic
particulate air pollution "is consistently and independently related to the
most serious effects, including lung_cancer[11] and other cardiopulmonary
mortality."[69] A large number of deaths[70] and other health problems
associated with particulate pollution was first demonstrated in the early 1970s
[71] and has been reproduced many times since. PM pollution is estimated to
cause 22,000â52,000 deaths per year in the United States (from 2000)[72]
contributed to ~370,000 premature deaths in Europe during 2005.[73] and 3.22
million deaths globally in 2010 per the global_burden_of_disease_collaboration.
[74]
A 2002 study indicated that PM2.5 leads to high plaque deposits in arteries,
causing vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis â a hardening of the
arteries that reduces elasticity, which can lead to heart attacks and other
cardiovascular problems.[75] A 2014 meta analysis reported that long term
exposure to particulate matter is linked to coronary events. The study included
11 cohorts participating in the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution
Effects (ESCAPE) with 100,166 participants, followed for an average of 11.5
years. An increase in estimated annual exposure to PM 2.5 of just 5 Âµg/m3 was
linked with a 13% increased risk of heart attacks.[76] In 2017 a study revealed
that PM not only affects human cells and tissues, but also impacts bacteria
which cause disease in humans.[77] This study concluded that biofilm formation,
antibiotic tolerance, and colonisation of both Staphylococcus_aureus and
Streptococcus_pneumoniae was altered by Black_Carbon exposure.
The World_Health_Organization_(WHO) estimated in 2005 that "... fine
particulate air pollution (PM(2.5)), causes about 3% of mortality from
cardiopulmonary disease, about 5% of mortality from cancer of the trachea,
bronchus, and lung, and about 1% of mortality from acute respiratory infections
in children under 5 years, worldwide.".[78] A 2011 study concluded that traffic
exhaust is the single most serious preventable cause of heart_attack in the
general public, the cause of 7.4% of all attacks.[79]
The largest US study on acute health effects of coarse particle pollution
between 2.5 and 10 micrometers in diameter. was published 2008 and found an
association with hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases but no
evidence of an association with the number of hospital admissions for
respiratory diseases.[80] After taking into account fine particle levels (PM2.5
and less), the association with coarse particles remained but was no longer
statistically significant, which means the effect is due to the subsection of
fine particles.
Particulate matter studies in Bangkok Thailand from 2008 indicated a 1.9%
increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, and 1.0% risk of all
disease for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Levels averaged 65 in 1996, 68
in 2002, and 52 in 2004. Decreasing levels may be attributed to conversions of
diesel to natural gas combustion as well as improved regulations.[81]
The Mongolian government agency recorded a 45% increase in the rate of
respiratory illness in the past five years (reported in September 2014).
Bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial
pneumonia were the most common ailments treated by area hospitals. Levels of
premature death, chronic bronchitis, and cardiovascular disease are increasing
at a rapid rate.[24]
A study In 2000 conducted in the U.S. explored how fine particulate matter may
be more harmful than coarse particulate matter. The study was based on six
different cities. They found that deaths and hospital visits that were caused
by particulate matter in the air were primarily due fine particulate matter.
[82]
***** Effects on vegetation[edit] *****
Particulate matter can clog stomatal openings of plants and interfere with
photosynthesis functions.[83] In this manner, high particulate matter
concentrations in the atmosphere can lead to growth stunting or mortality in
some plant species.
***** Regulation[edit] *****
Due to the highly toxic health effects of particulate matter, most governments
have created regulations both for the emissions allowed from certain types of
pollution sources (motor vehicles, industrial emissions etc.) and for the
ambient concentration of particulates. The IARC and WHO designate particulates
a Group_1_carcinogen. Particulates are the deadliest form of air_pollution due
to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered,
causing permanent DNA mutations, heart_attacks and premature_death.[10] In
2013, the ESCAPE study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries
revealed that there was no safe level of particulates and that for every
increase of 10 Î¼g/m3 in PM10, the lung cancer rate rose 22%. For PM2.5 there
was a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 Î¼g/m3.[11] In a 2014 meta-analysis of
18 studies globally including the ESCAPE data, for every increase of 10 Î¼g/m3
in PM2.5, the lung cancer rate rose 9%.[84]

**** Canada[edit] ****
In Canada the standard for particulate matter is set nationally by the federal-
provincial Canadian_Council_of_Ministers_of_the_Environment (CCME).
Jurisdictions (provinces and territories) may set more stringent standards. The
CCME standard for particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) as of 2015 is 28 Î¼g/m3
(calculated using the 3-year average of the annual 98th percentile of the daily
24-hr average concentrations) and 10 Î¼g/mÂ³ (3-year average of annual mean).
PM2.5 standards will increase in stringency in 2020.[86]

Air quality trends in the United States
*** California[edit] ***
                        This section needs to be updated. Please update this
[Ambox current red.svg] article to reflect recent events or newly available
                        information.

Air quality trends in the western United States
In October 2008, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), within the
California_Environmental_Protection_Agency, announced its intent to request
information regarding analytical test methods, fate and transport in the
environment, and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon
nanotubes.[99] DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and
Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020.[100] These sections were added
as a result of the adoption of Assembly Bill AB 289 (2006).[100] They are
intended to make information on the fate and transport, detection and analysis,
and other information on chemicals more available. The law places the
responsibility to provide this information to the Department on those who
manufacture or import the chemicals.
On 22 January 2009, a formal information request letter[101] was sent to
manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California, or who may
export carbon nanotubes into the State.[102] This letter constitutes the first
formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB 289 and is
directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes, both industry and academia
within the State, and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon
nanotubes to California. This request for information must be met by the
manufacturers within one year. DTSC is waiting for the upcoming 22 January 2010
deadline for responses to the data call-in.
The California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full-day symposium on 16
November 2009 in Sacramento, CA. This symposium provided an opportunity to hear
from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory
considerations in California.[103]
DTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call-in to members of the
nanometal oxides, the latest information can be found on their website.[104]

Air quality trends in the southwestern United States
Key points in the Colorado Plan include reducing emission levels and solutions
by sector. Agriculture, transportation, green electricity, and renewable energy
research are the main concepts and goals in this plan. Political programs such
as mandatory vehicle emissions testing and the prohibition of smoking indoors
are actions taken by local government to create public awareness and
participation in cleaner air. The location of Denver next to the Rocky
Mountains and wide expanse of plains makes the metro area of Colorado's capital
city a likely place for smog and visible air pollution.
***** Affected areas[edit] *****
U.S. counties violating national PM2.5 standards
U.S. counties violating national PM10 standards
Concentration of PM10[73][clarification_needed] in Europe
The most concentrated particulate matter pollution resulting from the burning
of fossil fuels by transportation and industrial sources tends to be in densely
populated metropolitan areas in developing countries such as Delhi and Beijing.
**** Australia[edit] ****
PM10 pollution in coal_mining areas in Australia such as the Latrobe_Valley in
Victoria and the Hunter_Region in New South Wales significantly increased
during 2004 to 2014. Although the increase did not significantly add to non-
attainment statistics the rate of increase has risen each year during 2010 to
2014.[105]
**** China[edit] ****
Some cities in Northern China and South Asia have had concentrations above
200 Âµg/m3 up to a few years ago[when?].[citation_needed] The PM levels in
Chinese cities have been extreme in recent years[when?], reaching an all-time
high in Beijing on 12 January 2013, of 993 Âµg/m3.[24]
To monitor the air quality of south China, the U.S. Consulate Guangzhou set a
PM 2.5 monitor on Shamian_Island in Guangzhou, and displays readings on its
official website and social platforms.[106]
**** Ulaanbaatar[edit] ****
Mongolia's capital city Ulaanbaatar has an annual average mean temperature of
about 0 Â°C, making it the world's coldest capital city. About 40% of the
population lives in apartments, 80% of which are supplied with central heating
systems from 3 combined heat and power plants. In 2007, the power plants
consumed almost 3.4 million tons of coal. The pollution control technology is
in poor condition.[citation_needed]
The other 60% of the population reside in shantytowns (Ger districts), which
have developed due to the country's new market economy and the very cold winter
seasons. The poor in these districts cook and heat their wood houses with
indoor stoves fueled by wood or coal. The resulting air pollution is
characterized by raised sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide levels and very high
concentrations of airborne particles and particulate_matter (PM).[24] Annual
seasonal average particulate matter concentrations have been recorded as high
as 279 Âµg/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter).[citation_needed] The World Health
Organization's recommended annual mean PM10 level is 20 Âµg/m3,[107] which
means that Ulaanbaatar's PM10 annual mean levels are 14 times higher than
recommended.[citation_needed]
During the winter months in particular, the air pollution obscures the air,
affecting the visibility in the city to such an extent that airplanes on some
occasions are prevented from landing at the airport.[citation_needed]
In addition to stack emissions, another source unaccounted for in the emission
inventory is fly_ash from ash ponds, the final disposal place for fly ash that
has been collected in settling tanks. Ash ponds are continually eroded by wind
during the dry season.[citation_needed]
