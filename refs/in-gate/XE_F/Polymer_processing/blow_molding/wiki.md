The blow molding process
Blow molding (BrE moulding) is a specific manufacturing process by which hollow
plastic parts are formed and can be joined together. It is also used for
forming glass_bottles or other hollow shapes.
In general, there are three main types of blow molding:
extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and injection stretch blow
molding.
The blow molding process begins with melting down the plastic and forming it
into a parison or, in the case of injection and injection stretch blow molding
(ISB), a preform. The parison is a tube-like piece of plastic with a hole in
one end through which compressed air can pass.
The parison is then clamped into a mold and air is blown into it. The air
pressure then pushes the plastic out to match the mold. Once the plastic has
cooled and hardened the mold opens up and the part is ejected. The cost of blow
molded parts is higher than that of injection-molded parts but lower than
rotational molded parts.

***** History[edit] *****
The process principle comes from the idea of glassblowing. Enoch Ferngren and
William Kopitke produced a blow molding machine and sold it to Hartford Empire
Company in 1938. This was the beginning of the commercial blow molding process.
During the 1940s the variety and number of products was still very limited and
therefore blow molding did not take off until later. Once the variety and
production rates went up the number of products created soon followed.
The technical mechanisms needed to produce hollow bodied workpieces using the
blowing technique were established very early on. Because glass is very
breakable, after the introduction of plastic, plastic was being used to replace
glass in some cases. The first mass production of plastic_bottles was done in
America in 1939. Germany started using this technology a little bit later, but
is currently one of the leading manufacturers of blow molding machines.
In the United States soft_drink_industry, the number of plastic_containers went
from zero in 1977 to ten billion pieces in 1999. Today, an even greater number
of products are blown and it is expected to keep increasing.
For amorphous_metals, also known as bulk metallic glasses, blow molding has
been recently demonstrated under pressures and temperatures comparable to
plastic blow molding.[1]

**** Extrusion blow molding[edit] ****
Extrusion blow molding
In extrusion blow molding (EBM), plastic is melted and extruded into a hollow
tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled
metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it into the shape of
the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled
sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected.[2] Continuous and
Intermittent are two variations of Extrusion Blow Molding. In continuous
extrusion blow molding the parison is extruded continuously and the individual
parts are cut off by a suitable knife. In Intermittent blow molding there are
two processes: straight intermittent is similar to injection molding whereby
the screw turns, then stops and pushes the melt out. With the accumulator
method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has
cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and
forms the parison. In this case the screw may turn continuously or
intermittently.[3] With continuous extrusion the weight of the parison drags
the parison and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The accumulator
head or reciprocating screw methods use hydraulic systems to push the parison
out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over
the wall thickness by adjusting the die gap with a parison programming device.
EBM processes may be either continuous (constant extrusion of the parison) or
intermittent. Types of EBM equipment may be categorized as follows:
Continuous extrusion equipment
    * rotary_wheel_blow_molding_systems
    * shuttle_machinery
Intermittent extrusion machinery
    * reciprocating_screw_machinery
    * accumulator_head_machinery
Examples of parts made by the EBM process include most polyethylene hollow
products, milk bottles, shampoo bottles, automotive ducting, watering cans and
hollow industrial parts such as drums.
Advantages of blow molding include: low tool and die cost; fast production
rates; ability to mold complex part; Handles can be incorporated in the design.
Disadvantages of blow molding include: limited to hollow parts, low strength,
to increase barrier properties multilayer parisons of different materials are
used thus not recyclable. To make wide neck jars spin trimming is necessary.
**** Spin trimming[edit] ****
Containers such as jars often have an excess of material due to the molding
process. This is trimmed off by spinning a knife around the container which
cuts the material away. This excess plastic is then recycled to create new
moldings. Spin Trimmers are used on a number of materials, such as PVC, HDPE
and PE+LDPE. Different types of the materials have their own physical
characteristics affecting trimming. For example, moldings produced from
amorphous materials are much more difficult to trim than crystalline materials.
Titanium coated blades are often used rather than standard steel to increase
life by a factor of 30 times.
**** Injection blow molding[edit] ****
The process of injection blow molding (IBM) is used for the production of
hollow glass and plastic objects in large quantities. In the IBM process, the
polymer is injection molded onto a core pin; then the core pin is rotated to a
blow molding station to be inflated and cooled. This is the least-used of the
three blow molding processes, and is typically used to make small medical and
single serve bottles. The process is divided into three steps: injection,
blowing and ejection.
The injection blow molding machine is based on an extruder barrel and screw
assembly which melts the polymer. The molten polymer is fed into a hot runner
manifold where it is injected through nozzles into a heated cavity and core
pin. The cavity mold forms the external shape and is clamped around a core rod
which forms the internal shape of the preform. The preform consists of a fully
formed bottle/jar neck with a thick tube of polymer attached, which will form
the body. similar in appearance to a test tube with a threaded neck.
The preform mold opens and the core rod is rotated and clamped into the hollow,
chilled blow mold. The end of the core rod opens and allows compressed air into
the preform, which inflates it to the finished article shape.
After a cooling period the blow mold opens and the core rod is rotated to the
ejection position. The finished article is stripped off the core rod and as an
option can be leak-tested prior to packing. The preform and blow mold can have
many cavities, typically three to sixteen depending on the article size and the
required output. There are three sets of core rods, which allow concurrent
preform injection, blow molding and ejection.
Advantages: It produces an injection molded neck for accuracy.
Disadvantages: only suits small capacity bottles as it is difficult to control
the base centre during blowing. No increase in barrier strength as the material
is not biaxially stretched. Handles can't be incorporated.
**** Injection stretch blow molding process[edit] ****
This has two main different methods, namely Single-stage and two-stage process.
Single-stage process is again broken down into 3-station and 4-station
machines. In the two-stage injection stretch blow molding process, the plastic
is first molded into a "preform" using the injection molding process. These
preforms are produced with the necks of the bottles, including threads (the
"finish") on one end. These preforms are packaged, and fed later (after
cooling) into a reheat stretch blow molding machine. In the ISB process, the
preforms are heated (typically using infrared heaters) above their glass
transition temperature, then blown using high-pressure air into bottles using
metal blow molds. The preform is always stretched with a core rod as part of
the process.
Advantages: Very high volumes are produced. Little restriction on bottle
design. Preforms can be sold as a completed item for a third party to blow. Is
suitable for cylindrical, rectangular or oval bottles. Disadvantages: High
capital cost. Floor space required is high, although compact systems have
become available.
In the single-stage process both preform manufacture and bottle blowing are
performed in the same machine. The older 4-station method of injection, reheat,
stretch blow and ejection is more costly than the 3-station machine which
eliminates the reheat stage and uses latent heat in the preform, thus saving
costs of energy to reheat and 25% reduction in tooling. The process explained:
Imagine the molecules are small round balls, when together they have large air
gaps and small surface contact, by first stretching the molecules vertically
then blowing to stretch horizontally the biaxial stretching makes the molecules
a cross shape. These "crosses" fit together leaving little space as more
surface area is contacted thus making the material less porous and increasing
barrier strength against permeation. This process also increases the strength
to be ideal for filling with carbonated drinks.
Advantages
Highly suitable for low volumes and short runs. As the preform is not released
during the entire process the preform wall thickness can be shaped to allow
even wall thickness when blowing rectangular and non-round shapes.
Disadvantages
Restrictions on bottle design. Only a champagne_base can be made for carbonated
bottles.
