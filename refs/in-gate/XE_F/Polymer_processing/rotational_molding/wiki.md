A three-motor powered (tri-power) rotational-molding or spin-casting machine
Rotational Molding (BrE moulding) involves a heated hollow mold which is filled
with a charge or shot weight of material. It is then slowly rotated (usually
around two perpendicular axes), causing the softened material to disperse and
stick to the walls of the mold. In order to maintain even thickness throughout
the part, the mold continues to rotate at all times during the heating phase
and to avoid sagging or deformation also during the cooling phase. The process
was applied to plastics in the 1950s but in the early years was little used
because it was a slow process restricted to a small number of plastics. Over
time, improvements in process control and developments with plastic powders
have resulted in a significant increase in usage.
Rotocasting (also known as rotacasting), by comparison, uses self-curing resins
in an unheated mould, but shares slow rotational speeds in common with
rotational molding. Spin_casting should not be confused with either, utilizing
self-curing resins or white metal in a high-speed centrifugal casting machine.

***** History[edit] *****
In 1855, R. Peters of Britain documented the first use of biaxial rotation and
heat. This rotational molding process was used to create metal_artillery_shells
and other hollow vessels. The main purpose of using rotational molding was to
create consistency in wall thickness and density. In 1905 in the United States
F.A. Voelke used this method for the hollowing of wax objects. This led to G.S.
Baker's and G.W. Perks's process of making hollow chocolate eggs in 1910.
Rotational molding developed further and R.J. Powell used this process for
molding plaster_of_Paris in the 1920s. These early methods using different
materials directed the advancements in the way rotational molding is used today
with plastics.[1]
Plastics were introduced to the rotational molding process in the early 1950s.
One of the first applications was to manufacture doll heads. The machinery was
made of an E Blue box-oven machine, inspired by a General Motors rear axle,
powered by an external electric motor and heated by floor-mounted gas burners.
The mold was made out of electroformed nickel-copper, and the plastic was a
liquid PVC_plastisol. The cooling method consisted of placing the mold into
cold water. This process of rotational molding led to the creation of other
plastic toys. As demand for and popularity of this process increased, it was
used to create other products such as road cones, marine buoys, and car
armrests. This popularity led to the development of larger machinery. A new
system of heating was also created, going from the original direct gas jets to
the current indirect high velocity air system. In Europe during the 1960s the
Engel process was developed. This allowed large hollow containers to be
manufactured in low-density_polyethylene. The cooling method consisted of
turning off the burners and allowing the plastic to harden while still rocking
in the mold.[2]
In 1976, the Association of Rotational Moulders (ARM) was started in Chicago as
a worldwide trade association. The main objective of this association is to
increase awareness of the rotational molding technology and process.[2]
In the 1980s, new plastics, such as polycarbonate, polyester, and nylon, were
introduced to rotational molding. This has led to new uses for this process,
such as the creation of fuel tanks and industrial moldings. The research that
has been done since the late 1980s at Queen's_University_Belfast has led to the
development of more precise monitoring and control of the cooling processes
based on their development of the âRotolog systemâ.[2]
***** Equipment and tooling[edit] *****
Rotational molding machines are made in a wide range of sizes. They normally
consist of molds, an oven, a cooling chamber, and mold spindles. The spindles
are mounted on a rotating axis, which provides a uniform coating of the plastic
inside each mold.[3]
Molds (or tooling) are either fabricated from welded sheet steel or cast. The
fabrication method is often driven by part size and complexity; most intricate
parts are likely made out of cast tooling. Molds are typically manufactured
from stainless_steel or aluminum. Aluminum molds are usually much thicker than
an equivalent steel mold, as it is a softer metal. This thickness does not
affect cycle times significantly since aluminum's thermal conductivity is many
times greater than steel. Due to the need to develop a model prior to casting,
cast molds tend to have additional costs associated with the manufacturing of
the tooling, whereas fabricated steel or aluminum molds, particularly when used
for less complex parts, are less expensive. However, some molds contain both
aluminum and steel. This allows for variable thicknesses in the walls of the
product. While this process is not as precise as injection_molding, it does
provide the designer with more options. The aluminum addition to the steel
provides more heat_capacity, causing the melt-flow to stay in a fluid state for
a longer period.
**** Standard setup and equipment for rotational molding[edit] ****
Normally all rotation molding systems have a number of parts including molds,
oven, cooling chamber and mold spindles. The molds are used to create the part,
and are typically made of aluminium. The quality and finish of the product is
directly related to the quality of the mold being used. The oven is used to
heat the part while also rotating the part to form the part desired. The
cooling chamber is where the part is placed until it cools, and the spindles
are mounted to rotate and provide a uniform coat of plastic inside each mold.
**** Rotational molding Machines[edit] ****
*** Rock and roll machine[edit] ***
[Picture_of_a_Rock_and_Roll_rotational_moulding_machine_at_an_inclination_of_45
degrees]
A Rock and Roll rotational molding machine built in 2009
This is a specialized machine designed mainly to produce long narrow parts.
Some are of the clamshell type, thus one arm, but there are also shuttle-type
Rock & Roll machines, with two arms. Each arm rotates or rolls the mold 360
degrees in one direction and at the same time tips and rocks the mold 45
degrees above or below horizontal in the other direction. Newer machines use
forced hot air to heat the mold. These machines are best for large parts that
have a large length-to-width ratio. Because of the smaller heating chambers,
there is a saving in heating costs compared to bi-axial machines.[4]
*** Clamshell machine[edit] ***
This is a single arm rotational molding machine. The arm is usually supported
by other arms on both ends. The clamshell machine heats and cools the mold in
the same chamber. It takes up less space than equivalent shuttle and swing arm
rotational molders. It is low in cost compared to the size of products made. It
is available in smaller scales for schools interested in prototyping and for
high quality models. More than one mold can be attached to the single arm.[5]
*** Vertical or up & over rotational machine[edit] ***
The loading and unloading area is at the front of the machine between the
heating and cooling areas. These machines vary in size between small to medium
compared to other rotational machines. Vertical rotational molding machines are
energy efficient due to their compact heating and cooling chambers. These
machines have the same (or similar) capabilities as the horizontal carousel
multi-arm machines, but take up much less space.[6]
*** Shuttle machine[edit] ***
Most shuttle machines have two arms that move the molds back and forth between
the heating chamber and cooling station. The arms are independent of each other
and they turn the molds bi-axially. In some cases, the shuttle machine has only
one arm. This machine moves the mold in a linear direction in and out of
heating and cooling chambers. It is low in cost for the size of product
produced and the footprint is kept to a minimum compared to other types of
machines. It is also available in smaller scale for schools and prototyping.[5]
*** Swing arm machine[edit] ***
The swing-arm machine can have up to four arms, with a bi-axial movement. Each
arm is independent from each other as it is not necessary to operate all arms
at the same time. Each arm is mounted on a corner of the oven and it swings in
and out of the oven. On some swing-arm machines, a pair of arms is mounted on
the same corner, thus a four-arm machine has two pivot points. These machines
are very useful for companies that have long cooling cycles or require a lot of
time to demold parts, compared to the cook time. It is a lot easier to schedule
maintenance work or try to run a new mold without interrupting production on
the other arms of the machine.
*** Carousel machine[edit] ***
[Picture_of_a_Carousel_machine_with_4_independent_arm]
A Carousel machine with four independent arms
This is one of the most common bi-axial machines in the industry. It can have
up to 4 arms and six stations and it comes in a wide range of sizes. The
machine comes in two different models, fixed and independent. A fixed-arm
carousel consists of 3 fixed arms that must move together. One arm will be in
the heating chamber while the other is in the cooling chamber and the other in
the loading/reloading area. The fixed-arm carousel works well when working with
identical cycle times on each arm. The independent-arm carousel machine is
available with 3 or 4 arms that can move separately from the other. This allows
for different size molds, with different cycle times and thickness needs.[6]
***** Production process[edit] *****
The rotational molding process is a high-temperature, low-pressure plastic-
forming process that uses heat and biaxial rotation (i.e., angular rotation on
two axes) to produce hollow, one-piece parts.[7] Critics of the process point
to its long cycle times—only one or two cycles an hour can typically occur, as
opposed to other processes such as injection molding, where parts can be made
in a few seconds. The process does have distinct advantages. Manufacturing
large, hollow parts such as oil tanks is much easier by rotational molding than
any other method. Rotational molds are significantly cheaper than other types
of mold. Very little material is wasted using this process, and excess material
can often be re-used, making it a very economically and environmentally viable
manufacturing process.

Rotational Molding Process
The rotational molding process consists of four distinct phases:
   1. Loading a measured quantity of polymer (usually in powder form) into the
      mold.
   2. Heating the mold in an oven while it rotates, until all the polymer has
      melted and adhered to the mold wall. The hollow part should be rotated
      through two or more axes, rotating at different speeds, in order to avoid
      the accumulation of polymer powder. The length of time the mold spends in
      the oven is critical: too long and the polymer will degrade, reducing
      impact strength. If the mold spends too little time in the oven, the
      polymer melt may be incomplete. The polymer grains will not have time to
      fully melt and coalesce on the mold wall, resulting in large bubbles in
      the polymer. This has an adverse effect on the mechanical properties of
      the finished product.
   3. Cooling the mold, usually by fan. This stage of the cycle can be quite
      lengthy. The polymer must be cooled so that it solidifies and can be
      handled safely by the operator. This typically takes tens of minutes. The
      part will shrink on cooling, coming away from the mold, and facilitating
      easy removal of the part. The cooling rate must be kept within a certain
      range. Very rapid cooling (for example, water spray) would result in
      cooling and shrinking at an uncontrolled rate, producing a warped part.
   4. Removal of the part.
**** Recent improvements[edit] ****
Until recently, the process largely relied on both trial and error and the
experience of the operator to determine when the part should be removed from
the oven and when it was cool enough to be removed from the mold. Technology
has improved in recent years, allowing the air temperature in the mold to be
monitored, removing much of the guesswork from the process.
Much of the current research is into reducing the cycle time, as well as
improving part quality. The most promising area is in mold pressurization. It
is well known that applying a small amount of pressure internally to the mold
at the correct point in the heating phase accelerates coalescence of the
polymer particles during the melting, producing a part with fewer bubbles in
less time than at atmospheric_pressure. This pressure delays the separation of
the part from the mold wall due to shrinkage during the cooling phase, aiding
cooling of the part. The main drawback to this is the danger to the operator of
explosion of a pressurized part. This has prevented adoption of mold
pressurization on a large scale by rotomolding manufacturers.
***** Mold release agents[edit] *****
A good mold release agent (MRA) will allow the material to be removed quickly
and effectively. Mold releases can reduce cycle times, defects, and browning of
finished product. There are a number of mold release types available; they can
be categorized as follows:
    * Sacrificial coatings: the coating of MRA has to be applied each time
      because most of the MRA comes off on the molded part when it releases
      from the tool. Silicones are typical MRA compounds in this category.
    * Semi-permanent coatings: the coating, if applied correctly, will last for
      a number of releases before requiring to be re-applied or touched up.
      This type of coating is most prevalent in today's rotational molding
      industry. The active chemistry involved in these coatings is typically a
      polysiloxane.
    * Permanent coatings: most often some form of PTFE coating, which is
      applied to the mold. Permanent coatings avoid the need for operator
      application, but may become damaged by misuse.
***** Materials[edit] *****
More than 80% of all the material used is from the polyethylene family: cross-
linked_polyethylene (PEX), low-density_polyethylene (LDPE), linear_low-density
polyethylene (LLDPE), high-density_polyethylene (HDPE), and regrind. Other
compounds are PVC_plastisols, nylons, and polypropylene.
Order of materials most commonly used by industry:[8]
    * Polyethylene
    * Polypropylene
    * Polyvinyl_chloride
    * Nylon
    * Polycarbonate
These materials are also occasionally used (not in order of most used):[8]
    * Aluminum
    * Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene (ABS)
    * Acetal
    * Acrylic
    * Epoxy
    * Fluorocarbons
    * Ionomer
    * Polybutylene
    * Polyester
    * Polystyrene
    * Polyurethane
    * Silicone
    * Various foods (especially chocolate)
**** Natural materials[edit] ****
Recently it has become possible to use natural materials in the molding
process. Through the use of real sands and stone chip, sandstone composite can
be created which is 80% natural non-processed material.
Rotational molding of plaster is used to produce hollow statuettes.
Chocolate is rotationally molded to form hollow treats.
***** Products[edit] *****
Designers can select the best material for their application, including
materials that meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements.
Additives for weather resistance, flame retardation, or static elimination can
be incorporated. Inserts, graphics, threads, handles, minor undercuts, flat
surfaces without draft angles, or fine surface detail can be part of the
design. Designs can also be multi-wall, either hollow or foam filled.
Products that can be manufactured using rotational molding include storage
tanks, furniture, road signs and bollards, planters, pet houses, toys, bins and
refuse containers, doll parts, road cones, footballs, helmets, canoes, rowing
boats, tornado shelters[9], kayak hulls, underground cellars for vine and
vegetables storage and playground slides. The process is also used to make
highly specialised products, including UN-approved containers for the
transportation of nuclear fissile materials,[10] anti-piracy ship protectors,
[11] seals for inflatable oxygen masks[12] and lightweight components for the
aerospace industry.[13]

***** Design considerations[edit] *****
**** Designing for rotational molding[edit] ****
Another consideration is in the draft angles. These are required to remove the
piece from the mold. On the outside walls, a draft angle of 1Â° may work
(assuming no rough surface or holes). On inside walls, such as the inside of a
boat hull, a draft angle of 5Â° may be required.[14] This is due to shrinkage
and possible part warping.
Another consideration is of structural support ribs. While solid ribs may be
desirable and achievable in injection molding and other processes, a hollow rib
is the best solution in rotational molding.[15] A solid rib may be achieved
through inserting a finished piece in the mold but this adds cost.
Rotational molding excels at producing hollow parts. However, care must be
taken when this is done. When the depth of the recess is greater than the width
there may be problems with even heating and cooling. Additionally, enough room
must be left between the parallel walls to allow for the melt-flow to move
properly throughout the mold. Otherwise webbing may occur. A desirable parallel
wall scenario would have a gap at least three times the nominal wall thickness,
with five times the nominal wall thickness being optimal. Sharp corners for
parallel walls must also be considered. With angles of less than 45Â° bridging,
webbing, and voids may occur.[16]
**** Material limitations and considerations[edit] ****
Another consideration is the melt-flow of materials. Certain materials, such as
nylon, will require larger radii than other materials. Additionally, the
stiffness of the set material may be a factor. More structural and
strengthening measures may be required when a flimsy material is used.[17]
**** Wall thickness[edit] ****
One benefit of rotational molding is the ability to experiment, particularly
with wall thicknesses. Cost is entirely dependent on wall thickness, with
thicker walls being costlier and more time consuming to produce. While the wall
can have nearly any thickness, designers must remember that the thicker the
wall, the more material and time will be required, increasing costs. In some
cases, the plastics may significantly degrade due to extended periods at high
temperature. Also, different materials have different thermal_conductivity,
meaning they require different times in the heating chamber and cooling
chamber. Ideally, the part will be tested to use the minimum thickness required
for the application. This minimum will then be established as a nominal
thickness.[18]
For the designer, while variable thicknesses are possible, a process called
stop rotation is required. This process is limited in that only one side of the
mold may be thicker than the others. After the mold is rotated and all the
surfaces are sufficiently coated with the melt-flow, the rotation stops and the
melt-flow is allowed to pool at the bottom of the mold cavity.[18]
Wall thickness is important for corner radii as well. Large outside radii are
preferable to small radii. Large inside radii are also preferable to small
inside radii. This allows for a more even flow of material and a more even wall
thickness. However, an outside corner is generally stronger than an inside
corner.[18]
***** Process: advantages, limitations, and material requirements[edit] *****
**** Advantages[edit] ****
Rotational molding offers design advantages over other molding processes. With
proper design, parts assembled from several pieces can be molded as one part,
eliminating high fabrication costs. The process also has inherent design
strengths, such as consistent wall thickness and strong outside corners that
are virtually stress free. For additional strength, reinforcing ribs can be
designed into the part. Along with being designed into the part, they can be
added to the mold.
The ability to add prefinished pieces to the mold alone is a large advantage.
Metal threads, internal pipes and structures, and even different colored
plastics can all be added to the mold prior to the addition of plastic pellets.
However, care must be taken to ensure that minimal shrinkage while cooling will
not damage the part. This shrinking allows for mild undercuts and negates the
need for ejection mechanisms (in most pieces).
In some cases rotational molding can be used as a feasible alternative to blow
molding, this is due to the similarity in product outputs, with products such
as plastic bottles and cylindrical containers, this is only effective on a
smaller scale as it much more costly to blow mold regarding a small output, and
with fewer resulting products rotational molding is much cheaper, due to blow
molding relying on economies of scale regarding efficiency.
Another advantage lies in the molds themselves. Since they require less
tooling, they can be manufactured and put into production much more quickly
than other molding processes. This is especially true for complex parts, which
may require large amounts of tooling for other molding processes. Rotational
molding is also the process of choice for short runs and rush deliveries. The
molds can be swapped quickly or different colors can be used without purging
the mold. With other processes, purging may be required to swap colors.
Due to the uniform thicknesses achieved, large stretched sections are
nonexistent, which makes large thin panels possible (although warping may
occur). Also, there is little flow of plastic (stretching) but rather a placing
of the material within the part. These thin walls also limit cost and
production time.
Another cost advantage with rotational molding is the minimal amount of
material wasted in production. There are no sprues or runners (as in injection
molding), no off-cuts , or pinch off scrap (blow molding). What material is
wasted, through scrap or failed part testing, can usually be recycled.
**** Limitations[edit] ****
Rotationally molded parts have to follow some restrictions that are different
from other plastic processes. As it is a low pressure process, sometimes
designers face hard to reach areas in the mold. Good quality powder may help
overcome some situations, but usually the designers have to keep in mind that
it is not possible to make sharp threads that would be possible with injection
molding. Some products based on polyethylene can be put in the mold before
filling it with the main material. This can help to avoid holes that otherwise
would appear in some areas. This could also be achieved using molds with
movable sections.
Another limitation lies in the molds themselves. Unlike other processes where
only the product needs to be cooled before being removed, with rotational
molding the entire mold must be cooled. While water cooling processes are
possible, there is still a significant down time of the mold. Additionally,
this increases both financial and environmental costs. Some plastics will
degrade with the long heating cycles or in the process of turning them into a
powder to be melted.
The stages of heating and cooling involve transfer of heat first from the hot
medium to the polymer material and next from it to the cooling environment. In
both cases, the process of heat transfer occurs in an unsteady regime;
therefore, its kinetics attracts the greatest interest in considering these
steps. In the heating stage, the heat taken from the hot gas is absorbed both
by the mold and the polymer material. The rig for rotational molding usually
has a relatively small wall thickness and is manufactured from metals with a
high thermal conductivity (aluminum, steel). As a rule, the mold transfers much
more heat than plastic can absorb; therefore, the mold temperature must vary
linearly. The rotational velocity in rotational molding is rather low (4 to 20
rpm). As a result, in the first stages of the heating cycle, the charged
material remains as a powder layer at the bottom of the mold. The most
convenient way of changing the cycle is by applying PU sheets in hot rolled
forms.
**** Material requirements[edit] ****
Due to the nature of the process, materials selection must take into account
the following:
    * Due to high temperatures within the mold the plastic must have a high
      resistance to permanent change in properties caused by heat (high thermal
      stability).
    * The molten plastic will come into contact with the oxygen inside the
      moldâthis can potentially lead to oxidation of the melted plastic and
      deterioration of the material's properties. Therefore, the chosen plastic
      must have a sufficient amount of antioxidant molecules to prevent such
      degradation in its liquid state.
    * Because there is no pressure to push the plastic into the mold, the
      chosen plastic must be able to flow easily through the cavities of the
      mold. The part's design must also take into account the flow
      characteristics of the particular plastic chosen.
Rotational moulding is basically used for big storage tanks.
