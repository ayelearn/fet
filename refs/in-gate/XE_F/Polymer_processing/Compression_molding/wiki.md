Compression molding - simplified diagram of the process

Compression Moulding is a method of moulding in which the moulding material,
generally preheated, is first placed in an open, heated mould cavity. The mould
is closed with a top force or plug member, pressure is applied to force the
material into contact with all mould areas, while heat and pressure are
maintained until the moulding material has cured. The process employs
thermosetting resins in a partially cured stage, either in the form of
granules, putty-like masses, or preforms.
Compression molding is a high-volume, high-pressure method suitable for molding
complex, high-strength fiberglass reinforcements. Advanced composite
thermoplastics can also be compression molded with unidirectional tapes, woven
fabrics, randomly oriented fiber mat or chopped strand. The advantage of
compression molding is its ability to mold large, fairly intricate parts. Also,
it is one of the lowest cost molding methods compared with other methods such
as transfer_molding and injection_molding; moreover it wastes relatively little
material, giving it an advantage when working with expensive compounds.
However, compression molding often provides poor product consistency and
difficulty in controlling flashing, and it is not suitable for some types of
parts. Fewer knit_lines are produced and a smaller amount of fiber-length
degradation is noticeable when compared to injection molding. Compression-
molding is also suitable for ultra-large basic shape production in sizes beyond
the capacity of extrusion techniques. Materials that are typically manufactured
through compression molding include: Polyester fiberglass resin systems (SMC/
BMC), Torlon, Vespel, Poly(p-phenylene_sulfide) (PPS), and many grades of PEEK.

Compression molding is commonly utilized by product development engineers
seeking cost effective rubber and silicone parts. Manufacturers of low volume
compression molded components include PrintForm, 3D, STYS, and Aero MFG.
Compression molding was first developed to manufacture composite parts for
metal replacement applications, compression molding is typically used to make
larger flat or moderately curved parts. This method of molding is greatly used
in manufacturing automotive parts such as hoods, fenders, scoops, spoilers, as
well as smaller more intricate parts. The material to be molded is positioned
in the mold cavity and the heated platens are closed by a hydraulic ram. Bulk
molding compound (BMC) or sheet molding compound (SMC), are conformed to the
mold form by the applied pressure and heated until the curing reaction occurs.
SMC feed material usually is cut to conform to the surface area of the mold.
The mold is then cooled and the part removed.
Mold and material behavior vary based on material types. New I-PRESS Servo
Hydraulic technology provides end users with a greater degree of flexibility
with press movement & pressure profiles and control of external devices such as
automation to platen zone temperature control. With the latest of electronic
servo motor to high pressure hydraulic pump users save considerable energy and
the greatest in speed, distance, pressure, dwell time and burping movements.

Materials may be loaded into the mold either in the form of pellets or sheet,
or the mold may be loaded from a plasticating extruder. Materials are heated
above their melting points, formed and cooled. The more evenly the feed
material is distributed over the mold surface, the less flow orientation occurs
during the compression stage.[citation_needed]
Compression molding is also widely used to produce sandwich structures that
incorporate a core material such as a honeycomb or polymer foam.[2]
Thermoplastic matrices are commonplace in mass production industries. One
significant example are automotive applications where the leading technologies
are long fibre reinforced thermoplastics (LFT) and glass fiber mat reinforced
thermoplastics (GMT).
In compression molding there are six important considerations that an engineer
should bear in mind[citation_needed]:
    * Determining the proper amount of material.
    * Determining the minimum amount of energy required to heat the material.
    * Determining the minimum time required to heat the material.
    * Determining the appropriate heating technique.
    * Predicting the required force, to ensure that shot attains the proper
      shape.
    * Designing the mold for rapid cooling after the material has been
      compressed into the mold.

***** Process definition[edit] *****
Compression molding is a forming process in which a plastic material is placed
directly into a heated metal mold then is softened by the heat and therefore
forced to conform to the shape of the mold, as the mold closes. Once molding is
completed excess Flash may be removed. Typically, compression molding machines
open along a vertical axis.
***** Process characteristics[edit] *****
The use of thermoset plastic compounds characterizes this molding process from
many of the other molding processes. These thermosets can be in either preform
or granule shapes. Unlike some of the other processes we find that the
materials are usually preheated and measured before molding. This helps to
reduce excess flash. Inserts, usually metallic, can also be molded with the
plastic. As a side note, remember not to allow any undercuts on the shape, it
will make ejection especially difficult. Thermoplastic matrices with an
inherent indefinite shelf-life and shorter cycle moulding times are widely used
and examples are shown in Ref 3.
***** Process schematic[edit] *****
Compression molding is one of the oldest manufacturing technique for rubber
molding. The process parameters includes molding time, temperature, and
pressure. Usually, a 300-400 ton clamp pressure is used. The typical mold is
shaped like a clam shell. The molding press looked a lot like a ladle filled
vertical press used for casting aluminum. The bottom of the mold was always the
cavity. Compression molding used preforms made by an extruder/wink cutter or a
roller die/die cutter. Wink meaning that 2 blades meet on center to cut the
extrudate to length. For example; Molding water bottles used die cut sheets
from a roller die. The sheet was 3 inch by 6 inch. The first sheet was placed-
one below a core and one sheet of equal size above the core, and then the top
of the mold lowered by hand or by hoist to near shut. The mold was then pushed
into the press. The start button hydraulically closed the vertical press to
full pressure. The mold temperature was about 350 degrees. The platens of the
presses were steam heated. When the cycle ended (about 3.5-4.0 Minutes) the
press would open and the mold would be pulled out toward the operator. The
operator would try to open the clam shell mold top, and then lean the top of
the mold back against the press. Exposed is the bottle with the core still
inside. While the bottle was still hot the operator would insert prongs like
reverse pliers in between the bottle rubber and the steel core. The operator
would then stretch the bottle at the neck over the core to free the bottle. In
preparation of compression molding baby nipples and golf ball centers the
preforms were extruded. The baby nipple was a kidney shape about 2 inches tall
and 1/2 inch wide in the middle. The golf ball center preform had a 1 x 1 inch
round slug. Both slugs were designed to stand up in the mold cavity. During the
cycle the operator would load the jig with slugs. When the mold is opened, the
lower platen would lower and the mold would be hydraulically pushed ou to the
operator. Therein, the heat sheet (all molded parts from that cycle were joined
together by a parting line rind (flash)) were placed in a transfer cart. The
next cycle began by the jig being put over the mold. The slide tray was pulled
and the preforms were released into the cavity of the mold. The start button
moved the lower platen back into the press and the cure cycle bagan again.
Therein the first cycle was complete. Each operator ran an average of 4
presses. Loading an unload was done during the cycle. The heat sheets removed
from the mold were then transported to a die station. The die out station would
remove the rind leaving the finished parts. With the evolution of compression
molding, next was injection transfer. Basically the extruder was made part of
the molding cycle. The rubber was injected into an upper heated platen station,
and then pressure was applied to transfer molten rubber to the clamped mold.
The design of injection transfer and improved molds were more so plastic
injection molding except the platens and molds of injection transfer are
heated. In contrast plastic Injections molding shoots a hot plastic into a cold
mold.
***** Workpiece geometry[edit] *****
***** Setup and equipment[edit] *****
***** Typical tools and geometry produced[edit] *****
Three types of molds used are the flash plunger-type, straight plunger-type,
and the "landed" plunger-type molds. The flash type mold must have an accurate
charge of plastic and produces a horizontal flash (excess material protruding
from the mold). The straight plunger-type mold allows for some inaccuracy in
the charge of plastic and produces a vertical flash. The landed plunger type
mold must have an accurate charge of plastic, and no flash is produced. Further
details are explained in Ref 3.
