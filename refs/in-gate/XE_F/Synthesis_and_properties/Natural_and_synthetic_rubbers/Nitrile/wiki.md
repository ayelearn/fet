This article is about the group of organic compounds. For the synthetic rubber
product, see Nitrile_rubber.
The structure of a nitrile: the functional group is highlighted blue
A nitrile is any organic_compound that has a âCâ¡N functional_group.[1] The
prefix cyano- is used interchangeably with the term nitrile in industrial
literature. Nitriles are found in many useful compounds, including methyl
cyanoacrylate, used in super_glue, and nitrile_rubber, a nitrile-containing
polymer used in latex-free laboratory and medical_gloves. Nitrile rubber is
also widely used as automotive and other seals since it is resistant to fuels
and oils. Organic compounds containing multiple nitrile groups are known as
cyanocarbons.
Inorganic_compounds containing the âCâ¡N group are not called nitriles, but
cyanides instead.[2] Though both nitriles and cyanides can be derived from
cyanide salts, most nitriles are not nearly as toxic.

***** Structure and basic properties[edit] *****
The NâCâC geometry is linear in nitriles, reflecting the sp hybridization
of the triply bonded carbon. The CâN distance is short at 1.16 Ã, consistent
with a triple bond.[3] Nitriles are polar, as indicated by high dipole moments.
As liquids, they have high relative_permittivities, often in the 30s.
***** History[edit] *****
The first compound of the homolog row of nitriles, the nitrile of formic_acid,
hydrogen_cyanide was first synthesized by C._W._Scheele in 1782.[4][5] In 1811
J._L._Gay-Lussac was able to prepare the very toxic and volatile pure acid.[6]
Around 1832 benzonitrile, the nitrile of benzoic_acid, was prepared by
Friedrich_WÃ¶hler and Justus_von_Liebig, but due to minimal yield of the
synthesis neither physical nor chemical properties were determined nor a
structure suggested. In 1834 ThÃ©ophile-Jules_Pelouze synthesized
propionitrile, suggesting it to be an ether of propionic alcohol and
hydrocyanic acid.[7] The synthesis of benzonitrile by Hermann_Fehling in 1844
by heating ammonium benzoate was the first method yielding enough of the
substance for chemical research. Fehling determined the structure by comparing
his results to the already known synthesis of hydrogen cyanide by heating
ammonium formate. He coined the name "nitrile" for the newfound substance,
which became the name for this group of compounds.[8]
***** Synthesis[edit] *****
Industrially, the main methods for producing nitriles are ammoxidation and
hydrocyanation. Both routes are green in the sense that they do not generate
stoichiometric amounts of salts.
**** Ammoxidation[edit] ****
In ammoxidation, a hydrocarbon is partially oxidized in the presence of
ammonia. This conversion is practiced on a large scale for acrylonitrile:[9]
      CH3CH=CH2 + &#x200b;3⁄2 O2 + NH3 â NCCH=CH2 + 3 H2O
In the production of acrylonitrile, a side product is acetonitrile. On an
industrial scale, several derivatives of benzonitrile, phthalonitrile, as well
as Isobutyronitrile are prepared by ammoxidation. The process is catalysed by
metal_oxides and is assumed to proceed via the imine.
**** Hydrocyanation[edit] ****
Hydrocyanation is an industrial method for producing nitriles from hydrogen
cyanide and alkenes. The process requires homogeneous_catalysts. An example of
hydrocyanation is the production of adiponitrile, a precursor to nylon-6,6 from
1,3-butadiene:
      CH2=CHâCH=CH2 + 2 HCN â NC(CH2)4CN
**** From organic halides and cyanide salts[edit] ****
Two salt_metathesis_reactions are popular for laboratory scale reactions. In
the Kolbe_nitrile_synthesis, alkyl_halides undergo nucleophilic_aliphatic
substitution with alkali metal cyanides . Aryl nitriles are prepared in the
Rosenmund-von_Braun_synthesis.
**** Cyanohydrins[edit] ****
Synthesis of aromatic nitriles via silylated cyanohydrins
The cyanohydrins are a special class of nitriles. Classically they result from
the addition of alkali metal cyanides to aldehydes in the cyanohydrin_reaction.
Because of the polarity of the organic carbonyl, this reaction requires no
catalyst, unlike the hydrocyanation of alkenes. O-Silyl cyanohydrins are
generated by the addition trimethylsilyl_cyanide in the presence of a catalyst
(silylcyanation). Cyanohydrins are also prepared by transcyanohydrin reactions
starting, for example, with acetone_cyanohydrin as a source of HCN.[10]
**** Dehydration of amides and oximes[edit] ****
Nitriles can be prepared by the dehydration of primary amides. In the presence
of ethyl_dichlorophosphate and DBU benzamide converts to benzonitrile:[11]
Other reagents that are common used for this purpose include P4O10, and SOCl2.
      [Amide_dehydration]
      Two intermediates in this reaction are amide tautomer A and its phosphate
      adduct B.
In a related dehydration, secondary amides give nitriles by the von_Braun_amide
degradation. In this case, one C-N bond is cleaved. The dehydration of
aldoximes (RCH=NOH) also affords nitriles. Typical reagents for this
transformation are triethylamine/sulfur_dioxide, zeolites, or sulfuryl
chloride. Exploiting this approach is the One-pot_synthesis of nitriles from
aldehyde with hydroxylamine in the presence of sodium_sulfate.[12]
      [one-pot_synthesis_from_aldehyde]
    * from aryl carboxylic_acids (Letts_nitrile_synthesis)
**** Sandmeyer reaction[edit] ****
Aromatic nitriles are often prepared in the laboratory from the aniline via
diazonium_compounds. This is the Sandmeyer_reaction. It requires transition
metal cyanides.[13]
      ArN+
      2 + CuCN â ArCN + N2 + Cu+
**** Other methods[edit] ****
    * A commercial source for the cyanide group is diethylaluminum cyanide
      Et2AlCN which can be prepared from triethylaluminium and HCN.[14] It has
      been used in nucleophilic_addition to ketones.[15] For an example of its
      use see: Kuwajima_Taxol_total_synthesis
    * cyanide ions facilitate the coupling of dibromides. Reaction of Î±,Î±â²-
      dibromoadipic_acid with sodium_cyanide in ethanol yields the cyano
      cyclobutane:[16]
      [CyclobutaneByCyanideMediatedDibromideCoupling.png]
      In the so-called Franchimont Reaction (which was developed by the Belgian
      doctoral student Antoine Paul Nicolas Franchimont (1844-1919) in 1872) an
      Î±-bromocarboxylic acid is dimerized after hydrolysis of the cyanogroup
      and decarboxylation[17]
    * Aromatic nitriles can be prepared from base hydrolysis of trichloromethyl
      aryl ketimines (RC(CCl3)=NH) in the Houben-Fischer synthesis[18]
    * Nitriles can be obtained from primary amines via oxidation. Common
      methods include the use of potassium_persulfate,[19] Trichloroisocyanuric
      acid,[20] or anodic electrosynthesis.[21]
    * Î±-Amino_acids form nitriles and carbon_dioxide via various means of
      oxidative_decarboxylation.[22][23] Henry_Drysdale_Dakin discovered this
      oxidation in 1916.[24]
***** Reactions[edit] *****
Nitrile groups in organic compounds can undergo a variety of reactions
depending on the reactants or conditions. A nitrile group can be hydrolyzed,
reduced, or ejected from a molecule as a cyanide ion.
**** Hydrolysis[edit] ****
The hydrolysis of nitriles RCN proceeds in the distinct steps under acid or
base treatment to first give carboxamides RC(=O)NH2 and then carboxylic_acids
RCOOH. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is efficient. In acid or
base, the balanced equations are as follows:
      RCN + 2H2O + HCl â RCO2H + NH4Cl
      RCN + H2O + NaOH â RCO2Na + NH3
Note that strictly speaking, these reactions are mediated (as opposed to
catalyzed) by acid or base, since one equivalent of the acid or base is
consumed to form the ammonium or carboxylate salt, respectively.
Kinetic studies show that the second-order rate constant for hydroxide-ion
catalyzed hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetamide is 1.6 Ã 10â6 Mâ1 sâ1,
which is slower than the hydrolysis of the amide to the carboxylate
(7.4 Ã 10â5 Mâ1 sâ1). Thus, the base hydrolysis route will afford the
carboxylate (or the amide contaminated with the carboxylate). On the other
hand, the acid catalyzed reactions requires a careful control of the
temperature and of the ratio of reagents in order to avoid the formation of
polymers, which is promoted by the exothermic character of the hydrolysis.[25]
The classical procedure to convert a nitrile to the corresponding primary amide
calls for adding the nitrile to cold concentrated sulfuric acid.[26] The
further conversion to the carboxylic acid is disfavored by the low temperature
and low concentration of water.
      RCN + H2O â RC(O)NH2 (H2SO4 is a catalyst)
Two families of enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles. Nitrilases
hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids:
      RCN + 2 H2O â RCO2H + NH3
Nitrile_hydratases are metalloenzymes that hydrolyze nitriles to amides.
      RCN + H2O â RC(O)NH2
These enzymes are used commercially to produce acrylamide.
**** Reduction[edit] ****
Main article: Nitrile_reduction
Nitriles are susceptible to hydrogenation over diverse metal catalysts. The
reaction can afford either the primary amine (RCH2NH2) or the tertiary amine (
(RCH2)3N), depending on conditions.[27] In conventional organic_reductions,
nitrile is reduced by treatment with lithium_aluminium_hydride to the amine.
Reduction to the imine followed by hydrolysis to the aldehyde takes place in
the Stephen_aldehyde_synthesis, which uses stannous_chloride in acid.
**** Alkylation[edit] ****
Alkyl nitriles are sufficiently acidic to form nitrile_anions, which alkylate a
wide variety of electrophiles.[28] Key to the exceptional nucleophilicity is
the small steric demand of the CN unit combined with its inductive
stabilization. These features make nitriles ideal for creating new carbon-
carbon bonds in sterically demanding environments for use in syntheses of
medicinal chemistry. Recent developments have shown that the nature of the
metal counter-ion causes different coordination to either the nitrile nitrogen
or the adjacent nucleophilic carbon, often with profound differences in
reactivity and stereochemistry.[29]
**** Nucleophiles[edit] ****
The carbon center of a nitrile is electrophilic, hence it is susceptible to
nucleophilic_addition reactions:
    * with an organozinc_compound in the Blaise_reaction
    * with alcohols in the Pinner_reaction.
    * with amines, e.g. the reaction of the amine sarcosine with cyanamide
      yields creatine[30]
    * Nitriles react in FriedelâCrafts acylation in the HoubenâHoesch
      reaction to ketones
**** Miscellaneous methods and compounds[edit] ****
    * In reductive decyanation the nitrile group is replaced by a proton.[31]
      Decyanations can be accomplished by dissolving_metal_reduction (e.g. HMPA
      and potassium metal in tert-butanol) or by fusion of a nitrile in KOH.
      [32] Similarly, Î±-aminonitriles can be decyanated with other reducing
      agents such as lithium_aluminium_hydride.[31]
    * Nitriles self-react in presence of base in the Thorpe_reaction in a
      nucleophilic_addition
    * In organometallic_chemistry nitriles are known to add to alkynes in
      carbocyanation:[33]
      [Carbocyanation_Nakao_2007]
**** Complexation[edit] ****
Nitriles are precursors to transition_metal_nitrile_complexes, which are
reagents and catalysts. Examples include [Cu(MeCN)4]+ and PdCl2(PhCN)2).[34]
Sample of the nitrile complex PdCl2(PhCN)2
***** Nitrile derivatives[edit] *****
**** Organic cyanamides[edit] ****
Cyanamides are N-cyano compounds with general structure R1R2NâCN and related
to the inorganic parent cyanamide. For an example see: von_Braun_reaction.
**** Nitrile oxides[edit] ****
Nitrile oxides have the general structure RâCNO.
          R  &#x2212;  C  &#x2261;    N &#x2295;    &#x2212;   O  &#x2296;
      {\displaystyle {\ce {R-C{\equiv }{\overset {\oplus }{N}}-O^{\ominus }}}}
      [{\displaystyle {\ce {R-C{\equiv }{\overset {\oplus }{N}}-O^{\ominus
      }}}}]
***** Occurrence and applications[edit] *****
Nitriles occur naturally in a diverse set of plant and animal sources. Over 120
naturally occurring nitriles have been isolated from terrestrial and marine
sources. Nitriles are commonly encountered in fruit pits, especially almonds,
and during cooking of Brassica crops (such as cabbage, brussel sprouts, and
cauliflower), which release nitriles through hydrolysis. Mandelonitrile, a
cyanohydrin produced by ingesting almonds or some fruit pits, releases hydrogen
cyanide and is responsible for the toxicity of cyanogenic glycosides.[35]
Over 30 nitrile-containing pharmaceuticals are currently marketed for a diverse
variety of medicinal indications with more than 20 additional nitrile-
containing leads in clinical development. The nitrile group is quite robust
and, in most cases, is not readily metabolized but passes through the body
unchanged[citation_needed]. The types of pharmaceuticals containing nitriles
are diverse, from vildagliptin, an antidiabetic drug, to anastrozole, which is
the gold standard in treating breast cancer. In many instances the nitrile
mimics functionality present in substrates for enzymes, whereas in other cases
the nitrile increases water solubility or decreases susceptibility to oxidative
metabolism in the liver.[36] The nitrile functional group is found in several
drugs.
    * Structure of periciazine, an antipsychotic studied in the treatment of
      opiate dependence.
    * Structure of citalopram, an antidepressant drug of the selective
      serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor (SSRI) class.
    * Structure of cyamemazine, an antipsychotic drug.
    * Structure of fadrozole, an aromatase_inhibitor for the treatment of
      breast cancer.
    * Structure of letrozole, an oral nonsteroidal aromatase_inhibitor for the
      treatment of certain breast cancers.
