Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become
distinct species. The biologist Orator_F._Cook coined the term in 1906 for
cladogenesis, the splitting of lineages, as opposed to anagenesis, phyletic
evolution within lineages.[1][2][3] Charles_Darwin was the first to describe
the role of natural_selection in speciation in his 1859 book On_the_Origin_of
Species.[4] He also identified sexual_selection as a likely mechanism, but
found it problematic.
There are four geographic modes of speciation in nature, based on the extent to
which speciating populations are isolated from one another: allopatric,
peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric. Speciation may also be induced
artificially, through animal_husbandry, agriculture, or laboratory_experiments.
Whether genetic_drift is a minor or major contributor to speciation is the
subject matter of much ongoing discussion.
Rapid sympatric speciation can take place through polyploidy, such as by
doubling of chromosome number; the result is progeny which are immediately
reproductively_isolated from the parent population. New species can also be
created through hybridisation followed, if the hybrid is favoured by natural
selection, by reproductive isolation.

***** Historical background[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_speciation
In addressing the question of the origin of species, there are two key issues:
(1) what are the evolutionary mechanisms of speciation, and (2) what accounts
for the separateness and individuality of species in the biota? Since Charles
Darwin's time, efforts to understand the nature of species have primarily
focused on the first aspect, and it is now widely agreed that the critical
factor behind the origin of new species is reproductive isolation.[5] Next we
focus on the second aspect of the origin of species.
**** Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist?[edit] ****
In On_the_Origin_of_Species (1859), Darwin interpreted biological evolution in
terms of natural selection, but was perplexed by the clustering of organisms
into species.[6] Chapter 6 of Darwin's book is entitled "Difficulties of the
Theory." In discussing these "difficulties" he noted "Firstly, why, if species
have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not
everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in
confusion instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?" This
dilemma can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties
in habitat space.[7]
Another dilemma,[8] related to the first one, is the absence or rarity of
transitional varieties in time. Darwin pointed out that by the theory of
natural selection "innumerable transitional forms must have existed," and
wondered "why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of
the earth." That clearly defined species actually do exist in nature in both
space and time implies that some fundamental feature of natural selection
operates to generate and maintain species.[6]
**** The effect of sexual reproduction on species formation[edit] ****
It has been argued that the resolution of Darwin's first dilemma lies in the
fact that out-crossing sexual_reproduction has an intrinsic cost of rarity.[9]
[10][11][12][13] The cost of rarity arises as follows. If, on a resource
gradient, a large number of separate species evolve, each exquisitely adapted
to a very narrow band on that gradient, each species will, of necessity,
consist of very few members. Finding a mate under these circumstances may
present difficulties when many of the individuals in the neighborhood belong to
other species. Under these circumstances, if any speciesâ population size
happens, by chance, to increase (at the expense of one or other of its
neighboring species, if the environment is saturated), this will immediately
make it easier for its members to find sexual partners. The members of the
neighboring species, whose population sizes have decreased, experience greater
difficulty in finding mates, and therefore form pairs less frequently than the
larger species. This has a snowball effect, with large species growing at the
expense of the smaller, rarer species, eventually driving them to extinction.
Eventually, only a few species remain, each distinctly different from the
other.[9][10][12] The cost of rarity not only involves the costs of failure to
find a mate, but also indirect costs such as the cost of communication in
seeking out a partner at low population densities.

species to a high degree of fidelity.[14]
Rarity brings with it other costs. Rare and unusual features are very seldom
advantageous. In most instances, they indicate a (non-silent) mutation, which
is almost certain to be deleterious. It therefore behooves sexual creatures to
avoid mates sporting rare or unusual features (koinophilia).[15][16] Sexual
populations therefore rapidly shed rare or peripheral phenotypic features, thus
canalizing the entire external appearance, as illustrated in the accompanying
illustration of the African_pygmy_kingfisher, Ispidina picta. This uniformity
of all the adult members of a sexual species has stimulated the proliferation
of field_guides on birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and many other taxa, in
which a species can be described with a single illustration (or two, in the
case of sexual_dimorphism). Once a population has become as homogeneous in
appearance as is typical of most species (and is illustrated in the photograph
of the African pygmy kingfisher), its members will avoid mating with members of
other populations that look different from themselves.[17] Thus, the avoidance
of mates displaying rare and unusual phenotypic features inevitably leads to
reproductive isolation, one of the hallmarks of speciation.[18][19][20][21]
In the contrasting case of organisms that reproduce_asexually, there is no cost
of rarity; consequently, there are only benefits to fine-scale adaptation.
Thus, asexual organisms very frequently show the continuous variation in form
(often in many different directions) that Darwin expected evolution to produce,
making their classification into "species" (more correctly, morphospecies) very
difficult.[9][15][16][22][23][24]
***** Modes[edit] *****
Comparison of allopatric, peripatric, parapatric and sympatric_speciation
All forms of natural speciation have taken place over the course of evolution;
however, debate persists as to the relative importance of each mechanism in
driving biodiversity.[25]
One example of natural speciation is the diversity of the three-spined
stickleback, a marine fish that, after the last_glacial_period, has undergone
speciation into new freshwater colonies in isolated lakes and streams. Over an
estimated 10,000 generations, the sticklebacks show structural differences that
are greater than those seen between different genera of fish including
variations in fins, changes in the number or size of their bony plates,
variable jaw structure, and color differences.[26]
**** Allopatric[edit] ****
Main article: Allopatric_speciation
During allopatric (from the ancient Greek allos, "other" + patrÄ,
"fatherland") speciation, a population splits into two geographically isolated
populations (for example, by habitat_fragmentation due to geographical change
such as mountain_formation). The isolated populations then undergo genotypic or
phenotypic divergence as: (a) they become subjected to dissimilar selective
pressures; (b) they independently undergo genetic drift; (c) different
mutations arise in the two populations. When the populations come back into
contact, they have evolved such that they are reproductively isolated and are
no longer capable of exchanging genes. Island_genetics is the term associated
with the tendency of small, isolated genetic pools to produce unusual traits.
Examples include insular_dwarfism and the radical changes among certain famous
island chains, for example on Komodo. The GalÃ¡pagos_Islands are particularly
famous for their influence on Charles Darwin. During his five weeks there he
heard that GalÃ¡pagos_tortoises could be identified by island, and noticed that
finches differed from one island to another, but it was only nine months later
that he reflected that such facts could show that species were changeable. When
he returned to England, his speculation on evolution deepened after experts
informed him that these were separate species, not just varieties, and famously
that other differing GalÃ¡pagos birds were all species of finches. Though the
finches were less important for Darwin, more recent research has shown the
birds now known as Darwin's_finches to be a classic case of adaptive
evolutionary radiation.[27]
**** Peripatric[edit] ****
Main article: Peripatric_speciation
In peripatric speciation, a subform of allopatric speciation, new species are
formed in isolated, smaller peripheral populations that are prevented from
exchanging genes with the main population. It is related to the concept of a
founder_effect, since small populations often undergo bottlenecks. Genetic
drift is often proposed to play a significant role in peripatric speciation.
[28][29]
Case studies include Mayr's investigation of bird fauna;[30] the Australian
bird Petroica_multicolor;[citation_needed] and reproductive isolation in
populations of Drosophila subject to population bottlenecking.[citation_needed]
**** Parapatric[edit] ****
Main article: Parapatric_speciation
In parapatric speciation, there is only partial separation of the zones of two
diverging populations afforded by geography; individuals of each species may
come in contact or cross habitats from time to time, but reduced fitness of the
heterozygote leads to selection for behaviours or mechanisms that prevent their
interbreeding. Parapatric speciation is modelled on continuous variation within
a "single," connected habitat acting as a source of natural selection rather
than the effects of isolation of habitats produced in peripatric and allopatric
speciation.[citation_needed]
Parapatric speciation may be associated with differential landscape-dependent
selection. Even if there is a gene_flow between two populations, strong
differential selection may impede assimilation and different species may
eventually develop.[31] Habitat differences may be more important in the
development of reproductive isolation than the isolation time. Caucasian rock
lizards Darevskia rudis, D. valentini and D. portschinskii all hybridize with
each other in their hybrid_zone; however, hybridization is stronger between D.
portschinskii and D. rudis, which separated earlier but live in similar
habitats than between D. valentini and two other species, which separated later
but live in climatically different habitats.[32]
Ecologists refer to[clarification_needed] parapatric and peripatric speciation
in terms of ecological_niches. A niche must be available in order for a new
species to be successful. Ring_species such as Larus gulls have been claimed to
illustrate speciation in progress, though the situation may be more complex.
[33] The grass Anthoxanthum_odoratum may be starting parapatric speciation in
areas of mine contamination.[34]
**** Sympatric[edit] ****
Main article: Sympatric_speciation
Cichlids such as Haplochromis_nyererei diversified by sympatric_speciation in
the Rift_Valley_lakes.
Sympatric speciation is the formation of two or more descendant species from a
single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location.
Often-cited examples of sympatric speciation are found in insects that become
dependent on different host plants in the same area.[35][36]
Sympatric Speciation with Cichlids.
The best known example of sympatric speciation is that of the cichlids of East
Africa inhabiting the Rift_Valley_lakes, particularly Lake_Victoria, Lake
Malawi and Lake_Tanganyika. There are over 800 described species, and according
to estimates, there could be well over 1,600 species in the region. Their
evolution is cited as an example of both natural and sexual_selection.[37][38]
A 2008 study suggests that sympatric speciation has occurred in Tennessee_cave
salamanders.[39] Sympatric speciation driven by ecological factors may also
account for the extraordinary diversity of crustaceans living in the depths of
Siberia's Lake_Baikal.[40]
Budding speciation has been proposed as a particular form of sympatric
speciation, whereby small groups of individuals become progressively more
isolated from the ancestral stock by breeding preferentially with one another.
This type of speciation would be driven by the conjunction of various
advantages of inbreeding such as the expression of advantageous recessive
phenotypes, reducing the recombination load, and reducing the cost of sex [41]
Rhagoletis_pomonella, the hawthorn fly, appears to be in the process of
sympatric speciation.
The hawthorn fly (Rhagoletis_pomonella), also known as the apple maggot fly,
appears to be undergoing sympatric speciation.[42] Different populations of
hawthorn fly feed on different fruits. A distinct population emerged in North
America in the 19th century some time after apples, a non-native species, were
introduced. This apple-feeding population normally feeds only on apples and not
on the historically preferred fruit of hawthorns. The current hawthorn feeding
population does not normally feed on apples. Some evidence, such as that six
out of thirteen allozyme loci are different, that hawthorn flies mature later
in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies; and that there is
little evidence of interbreeding (researchers have documented a 4-6%
hybridization rate) suggests that sympatric speciation is occurring.[43]
***** Methods of selection[edit] *****
**** Reinforcement[edit] ****
Reinforcement assists speciation by selecting against hybrids.
Main article: Reinforcement_(speciation)
Further information: Evidence_for_speciation_by_reinforcement
Reinforcement, sometimes referred to as the Wallace_effect, is the process by
which natural selection increases reproductive isolation.[18] It may occur
after two populations of the same species are separated and then come back into
contact. If their reproductive isolation was complete, then they will have
already developed into two separate incompatible species. If their reproductive
isolation is incomplete, then further mating between the populations will
produce hybrids, which may or may not be fertile. If the hybrids are infertile,
or fertile but less fit than their ancestors, then there will be further
reproductive isolation and speciation has essentially occurred (e.g., as in
horses and donkeys).[44]
The reasoning behind this is that if the parents of the hybrid offspring each
have naturally selected traits for their own certain environments, the hybrid
offspring will bear traits from both, therefore would not fit either ecological
niche as well as either parent. The low fitness of the hybrids would cause
selection to favor assortative_mating, which would control hybridization. This
is sometimes called the Wallace effect after the evolutionary biologist Alfred
Russel_Wallace who suggested in the late 19th century that it might be an
important factor in speciation.[45]
Conversely, if the hybrid offspring are more fit than their ancestors, then the
populations will merge back into the same species within the area they are in
contact.
Reinforcement favoring reproductive isolation is required for both parapatric
and sympatric speciation. Without reinforcement, the geographic area of contact
between different forms of the same species, called their "hybrid zone," will
not develop into a boundary between the different species. Hybrid zones are
regions where diverged populations meet and interbreed. Hybrid offspring are
very common in these regions, which are usually created by diverged species
coming into secondary_contact. Without reinforcement, the two species would
have uncontrollable inbreeding. Reinforcement may be induced in artificial
selection experiments as described below.
**** Ecological[edit] ****
Main article: Ecological_speciation
Ecological selection is "the interaction of individuals with their environment
during resource acquisition".[46] Natural selection is inherently involved in
the process of speciation, whereby, "under ecological speciation, populations
in different environments, or populations exploiting different resources,
experience contrasting natural selection pressures on the traits that directly
or indirectly bring about the evolution of reproductive isolation".[47]
Evidence for the role ecology plays in the process of speciation exists.
Studies of stickleback populations support ecologically-linked speciation
arising as a by-product,[48] alongside numerous studies of parallel speciation,
where isolation evolves between independent populations of species adapting to
contrasting environments than between independent populations adapting to
similar environments.[49] Ecological speciation occurs with much of the
evidence, "...accumulated from top-down studies of adaptation and reproductive
isolation".[49]
**** Sexual selection[edit] ****
It is widely appreciated that sexual_selection could drive speciation in many
clades, independently of natural_selection.[50] However the term
âspeciationâ, in this context, tends to be used in two different, but not
mutually exclusive senses. The first and most commonly used sense refers to the
âbirthâ of new species. That is, the splitting of an existing species into
two separate species, or the budding off of a new species from a parent
species, both driven by a biological "fashion fad" (a preference for a feature,
or features, in one or both sexes, that do not necessarily have any adaptive
qualities).[50][51][52][53] In the second sense, "speciation" refers to the
wide-spread tendency of sexual creatures to be grouped into clearly defined
species,[54][19] rather than forming a continuum of phenotypes both in time and
space - which would be the more obvious or logical consequence of natural
selection. This was indeed recognized by Darwin as problematic, and included in
his On_the_Origin_of_Species (1859), under the heading "Difficulties with the
Theory".[6] There are several suggestions as to how mate_choice might play a
significant role in resolving Darwinâs_dilemma.[19][9][15][16][17][55]
***** Artificial speciation[edit] *****
Gaur (Indian bison) can interbreed with domestic cattle.
Male Drosophila_pseudoobscura
See also: Laboratory_experiments_of_speciation
New species have been created by animal_husbandry, but the dates and methods of
the initiation of such species are not clear. Often, the domestic counterpart
of the wild ancestor can still interbreed and produce fertile offspring as in
the case of domestic cattle, that can be considered the same species as several
varieties of wild ox, gaur, yak, etc., or domestic sheep that can interbreed
with the mouflon.[56][57]
The best-documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed
in the late 1980s. William R. Rice and George W. Salt bred Drosophila
melanogaster fruit_flies using a maze with three different choices of habitat
such as light/dark and wet/dry. Each generation was placed into the maze, and
the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to
breed with each other in their respective groups. After thirty-five
generations, the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively
because of their strong habitat preferences: they mated only within the areas
they preferred, and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas.
[58] The history of such attempts is described by Rice and Elen E. Hostert
(1993).[59][60] Diane Dodd used a laboratory experiment to show how
reproductive isolation can develop in Drosophila_pseudoobscura fruit flies
after several generations by placing them in different media, starch- and
maltose-based media.[61]
[Drosophila_speciation_experiment.svg]
Dodd's experiment has been easy for many others to replicate, including with
other kinds of fruit flies and foods.[62] Research in 2005 has shown that this
rapid evolution of reproductive isolation may in fact be a relic of infection
by Wolbachia bacteria.[63]
Alternatively, these observations are consistent with the notion that sexual
creatures are inherently reluctant to mate with individuals whose appearance or
behavior is different from the norm. The risk that such deviations are due to
heritable_maladaptations is very high. Thus, if a sexual creature, unable to
predict natural selection's future direction, is conditioned to produce the
fittest offspring possible, it will avoid mates with unusual habits or
features.[64][65][15][16][17] Sexual creatures will then inevitably tend to
group themselves into reproductively isolated species.[16]
***** Genetics[edit] *****
Few speciation genes have been found. They usually involve the reinforcement
process of late stages of speciation. In 2008, a speciation gene causing
reproductive isolation was reported.[66] It causes hybrid sterility between
related subspecies. The order of speciation of three groups from a common
ancestor may be unclear or unknown; a collection of three such species is
referred to as a "trichotomy."
**** Speciation via polyploidy[edit] ****
Speciation via polyploidy: A diploid cell undergoes failed meiosis, producing
diploid gametes, which self-fertilize to produce a tetraploid zygote. In
plants, this can effectively be a new species, reproductively isolated from its
parents, and able to reproduce.
Main article: Polyploid
Polyploidy is a mechanism that has caused many rapid speciation events in
sympatry because offspring of, for example, tetraploid x diploid matings often
result in triploid sterile progeny.[67] However, not all polyploids are
reproductively isolated from their parental plants, and gene flow may still
occur for example through triploid hybrid x diploid matings that produce
tetraploids, or matings between meiotically_unreduced gametes from diploids and
gametes from tetraploids (see also hybrid_speciation).
It has been suggested that many of the existing plant and most animal species
have undergone an event of polyploidization in their evolutionary history.[68]
[69] Reproduction of successful polyploid species is sometimes asexual, by
parthenogenesis or apomixis, as for unknown reasons many asexual organisms are
polyploid. Rare instances of polyploid mammals are known, but most often result
in prenatal death.
**** Hybrid speciation[edit] ****
Main article: Hybrid_speciation
Hybridization between two different species sometimes leads to a distinct
phenotype. This phenotype can also be fitter than the parental lineage and as
such natural selection may then favor these individuals. Eventually, if
reproductive isolation is achieved, it may lead to a separate species. However,
reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly
difficult to achieve and thus hybrid speciation is considered an extremely rare
event. The Mariana_mallard is thought to have arisen from hybrid speciation.
Hybridization is an important means of speciation in plants, since polyploidy
(having more than two copies of each chromosome) is tolerated in plants more
readily than in animals.[70][71] Polyploidy is important in hybrids as it
allows reproduction, with the two different sets of chromosomes each being able
to pair with an identical partner during meiosis.[69] Polyploids also have more
genetic diversity, which allows them to avoid inbreeding_depression in small
populations.[72]
Hybridization without change in chromosome number is called homoploid hybrid
speciation. It is considered very rare but has been shown in Heliconius
butterflies [73] and sunflowers. Polyploid speciation, which involves changes
in chromosome number, is a more common phenomenon, especially in plant species.
**** Gene transposition[edit] ****
Further information: Transposable_element
Theodosius_Dobzhansky, who studied fruit flies in the early days of genetic
research in 1930s, speculated that parts of chromosomes that switch from one
location to another might cause a species to split into two different species.
He mapped out how it might be possible for sections of chromosomes to relocate
themselves in a genome. Those mobile sections can cause sterility in inter-
species hybrids, which can act as a speciation pressure. In theory, his idea
was sound, but scientists long debated whether it actually happened in nature.
Eventually a competing theory involving the gradual accumulation of mutations
was shown to occur in nature so often that geneticists largely dismissed the
moving gene hypothesis.[74] However, 2006 research shows that jumping of a gene
from one chromosome to another can contribute to the birth of new species.[75]
This validates the reproductive isolation mechanism, a key component of
speciation.[76]
***** Rates[edit] *****
Phyletic_gradualism, above, consists of relatively slow change over geological
time. Punctuated_equilibrium, bottom, consists of morphological stability and
rare, relatively rapid bursts of evolutionary change.
There is debate as to the rate at which speciation events occur over geologic
time. While some evolutionary biologists claim that speciation events have
remained relatively constant and gradual over time (known as "Phyletic
gradualism" - see diagram), some palaeontologists such as Niles_Eldredge and
Stephen_Jay_Gould[77] have argued that species usually remain unchanged over
long stretches of time, and that speciation occurs only over relatively brief
intervals, a view known as punctuated_equilibrium. (See diagram, and Darwin's
dilemma.)
**** Punctuated evolution[edit] ****
Main articles: Punctuated_equilibrium and Rate_of_evolution
Evolution can be extremely rapid, as shown in the creation of domesticated
animals and plants in a very short geological space of time, spanning only a
few tens of thousands of years. Maize (Zea mays), for instance, was created in
Mexico in only a few thousand years, starting about 7,000 to 12,000 years ago.
[78] This raises the question of why the long term rate of evolution is far
slower than is theoretically possible.[79][80][81][82]
Plants and domestic_animals can differ markedly from their wild ancestors

Evolution is imposed on species or groups. It is not planned or striven for in
some Lamarckist way.[83] The mutations on which the process depends are random
events, and, except for the "silent_mutations" which do not affect the
functionality or appearance of the carrier, are thus usually disadvantageous,
and their chance of proving to be useful in the future is vanishingly small.
Therefore, while a species or group might benefit from being able to adapt to a
new environment by accumulating a wide range of genetic variation, this is to
the detriment of the individuals who have to carry these mutations until a
small, unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an
adaptation. Thus, the capability to evolve would require group_selection, a
concept discredited by (for example) George_C._Williams,[84] John_Maynard_Smith
[85] and Richard_Dawkins[86][87][88][89] as selectively disadvantageous to the
individual.
The resolution to Darwin's second dilemma might thus come about as follows:
If sexual individuals are disadvantaged by passing mutations on to their
offspring, they will avoid mutant mates with strange or unusual
characteristics.[65][15][16][55] Mutations that affect the external appearance
of their carriers will then rarely be passed on to the next and subsequent
generations. They would therefore seldom be tested by natural selection.
Evolution is, therefore, effectively halted or slowed down considerably. The
only mutations that can accumulate in a population, on this punctuated
equilibrium view, are ones that have no noticeable effect on the outward
appearance and functionality of their bearers (i.e., they are "silent" or
"neutral_mutations," which can be, and are, used to trace the relatedness_and
age_of_populations_and_species.[15][90]) This argument implies that evolution
can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided, as a result of a severe
scarcity of potential mates. This is most likely to occur in small,_isolated
communities. These occur most commonly on small islands, in remote valleys,
lakes, river systems, or caves,[91] or during the aftermath of a mass
extinction.[90] Under these circumstances, not only is the choice of mates
severely restricted but population bottlenecks, founder effects, genetic drift
and inbreeding cause rapid, random changes in the isolated population's genetic
composition.[91] Furthermore, hybridization with a related species trapped in
the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes. If an isolated
population such as this survives_its_genetic_upheavals, and subsequently
expands into an unoccupied niche, or into a niche in which it has an advantage
over its competitors, a new species, or subspecies, will have come in being. In
geological terms, this will be an abrupt event. A resumption of avoiding mutant
mates will thereafter result, once again, in evolutionary stagnation.[77][80]
In apparent confirmation of this punctuated equilibrium view of evolution, the
fossil_record of an evolutionary progression typically consists of species that
suddenly appear, and ultimately disappear, hundreds of thousands or millions of
years later, without any change in external appearance.[77][90][92]
Graphically, these fossil species are represented by lines parallel with the
time axis, whose lengths depict how long each of them existed. The fact that
the lines remain parallel with the time axis illustrates the unchanging
appearance of each of the fossil species depicted on the graph. During each
species' existence new species appear at random intervals, each also lasting
many hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing without a change in
appearance. The exact relatedness of these concurrent species is generally
impossible to determine. This is illustrated in the diagram depicting the
distribution_of_hominin_species_through_time since the hominins separated from
the line that led to the evolution of our closest living primate relatives, the
chimpanzees.[92]
For similar evolutionary time lines see, for instance, the paleontological list
of African_dinosaurs, Asian_dinosaurs, the Lampriformes and Amiiformes.

      was that the "incompleteness" of the fossil record would be used to
      criticize his thory: that the apparent "gaps" in fossil succession could
      be cited as negative evidence, at the very least, for his proposal that
      all organisms have descended by minute and gradual modifications from a
      common ancestor.
