Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals
due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change
in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations.
Charles_Darwin popularised the term "natural selection", contrasting it with
artificial_selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural
selection is not.
Variation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly
because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and
offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals,
their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits.
The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other
cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic
environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to
survive and reproduce more than individuals with other, less successful
variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success
include sexual_selection (now often included in natural selection) and
fecundity_selection.
Natural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism
which actually interact with the environment, but the genetic (heritable) basis
of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become
more_common_in_a_population. Over time, this process can result in populations
that specialise for particular ecological_niches (microevolution) and may
eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution).
In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a
population.
Natural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by
Darwin and Alfred_Russel_Wallace in a joint_presentation_of_papers_in_1858, was
elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On_the_Origin_of_Species_by_Means
of_Natural_Selection,_or_the_Preservation_of_Favoured_Races_in_the_Struggle_for
Life. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a
process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human
breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural
selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at
the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of
genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian_evolution with subsequent
discoveries in classical_genetics formed the modern_synthesis of the mid-20th
century. The addition of molecular_genetics has led to evolutionary
developmental_biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While
genotypes can slowly change by random genetic_drift, natural selection remains
the primary explanation for adaptive_evolution.

***** Historical development[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_evolutionary_thought
**** Pre-Darwinian theories[edit] ****
Aristotle considered whether different forms could have appeared, only the
useful ones surviving.
Several philosophers of the classical_era, including Empedocles[1] and his
intellectual successor, the Roman poet Lucretius,[2] expressed the idea that
nature produces a huge variety of creatures, randomly, and that only those
creatures that manage to provide for themselves and reproduce successfully
persist. Empedocles' idea that organisms arose entirely by the incidental
workings of causes such as heat and cold was criticised by Aristotle in Book II
of Physics.[3] He posited natural teleology in its place, and believed that
form was achieved for a purpose, citing the regularity of heredity in species
as proof.[4][5] Nevertheless, he accepted in_his_biology that new types of
animals, monstrosities (ÏÎµÏÎ±Ï), can occur in very rare instances
(Generation_of_Animals, Book IV).[6] As quoted in Darwin's 1872 edition of The
Origin_of_Species, Aristotle considered whether different forms (e.g., of
teeth) might have appeared accidentally, but only the useful forms survived:
     So what hinders the different parts [of the body] from having this
     merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example, grow
     by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the
     grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they
     were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of
     accident. And in like manner as to the other parts in which there
     appears to exist an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all
     things together (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as
     if they were made for the sake of something, these were preserved,
     having been appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity, and
     whatsoever things were not thus constituted, perished, and still
     perish.
     â Aristotle, Physics, Book II, Chapter 8[7]
But Aristotle rejected this possibility in the next paragraph, making clear
that he is talking about the development of animals as embryos with the phrase
"either invariably or normally come about", not the origin of species:
     ... Yet it is impossible that this should be the true view. For teeth
     and all other natural things either invariably or normally come about
     in a given way; but of not one of the results of chance or
     spontaneity is this true. We do not ascribe to chance or mere
     coincidence the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in
     summer we do; nor heat in the dog-days, but only if we have it in
     winter. If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of
     coincidence or for an end, and these cannot be the result of
     coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for an end;
     and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the
     theory which is before us would agree. Therefore action for an end is
     present in things which come to be and are by nature.
     â Aristotle, Physics, Book II, Chapter 8[8]
The struggle_for_existence was later described by the Islamic writer Al-Jahiz
in the 9th century.[9][10][11]
The classical arguments were reintroduced in the 18th century by Pierre_Louis
Maupertuis[12] and others, including Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus_Darwin.
Until the early 19th century, the prevailing_view in Western_societies was that
differences between individuals of a species were uninteresting departures from
their Platonic_ideals (or typus) of created_kinds. However, the theory of
uniformitarianism in geology promoted the idea that simple, weak forces could
act continuously over long periods of time to produce radical changes in the
Earth's landscape. The success of this theory raised awareness of the vast
scale of geological_time and made plausible the idea that tiny, virtually
imperceptible changes in successive generations could produce consequences on
the scale of differences between species.[13]
The early 19th-century zoologist Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck suggested the
inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics as a mechanism for evolutionary change;
adaptive traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be inherited
by that organism's progeny, eventually causing transmutation_of_species.[14]
This theory, Lamarckism, was an influence on the Soviet biologist Trofim
Lysenko's antagonism to mainstream genetic theory as late as the mid 20th
century.[15]
Between 1835 and 1837, the zoologist Edward_Blyth worked on the area of
variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature.
Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of On the
Origin of Species.[16]
**** Darwin's theory[edit] ****
Main articles: Inception_of_Darwin's_theory and Development_of_Darwin's_theory
Further information: Coloration_evidence_for_natural_selection
In 1859, Charles Darwin set out his theory of evolution by natural selection as
an explanation for adaptation and speciation. He defined natural selection as
the "principle by which each slight variation [of a trait], if useful, is
preserved".[17] The concept was simple but powerful: individuals best adapted
to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce. As long as
there is some variation between them and that variation is heritable, there
will be an inevitable selection of individuals with the most advantageous
variations. If the variations are heritable, then differential reproductive
success leads to a progressive evolution of particular populations of a
species, and populations that evolve to be sufficiently different eventually
become different species.[18][19]
Part of Thomas_Malthus's table of population_growth in England 1780â1810,
from his Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population, 6th edition, 1826
Darwin's ideas were inspired by the observations that he had made on the second
voyage_of_HMS_Beagle (1831â1836), and by the work of a political economist,
Thomas_Robert_Malthus, who, in An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population (1798),
noted that population (if unchecked) increases_exponentially, whereas the food
supply grows only arithmetically; thus, inevitable limitations of resources
would have demographic implications, leading to a "struggle for existence".[20]
When Darwin read Malthus in 1838 he was already primed by his work as a
naturalist to appreciate the "struggle for existence" in nature. It struck him
that as population outgrew resources, "favourable variations would tend to be
preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be
the formation of new species."[21] Darwin wrote:
     If during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of
     life, organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their
     organisation, and I think this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing
     to the high geometrical powers of increase of each species, at some
     age, season, or year, a severe struggle for life, and this certainly
     cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the
     relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions
     of existence, causing an infinite diversity in structure,
     constitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, I think it
     would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred
     useful to each being's own welfare, in the same way as so many
     variations have occurred useful to man. But if variations useful to
     any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterised
     will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for
     life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to
     produce offspring similarly characterised. This principle of
     preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural
     Selection.
     â Darwin summarising natural selection in the fourth chapter of On
     the_Origin_of_Species[22]
Once he had his theory, Darwin was meticulous about gathering and refining
evidence before making his idea public. He was in the process of writing his
"big book" to present his research when the naturalist Alfred_Russel_Wallace
independently conceived of the principle and described it in an essay he sent
to Darwin to forward to Charles_Lyell. Lyell and Joseph_Dalton_Hooker decided
to present his essay together with unpublished writings that Darwin had sent to
fellow naturalists, and On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties;_and_on
the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection was
read to the Linnean_Society_of_London announcing co-discovery of the principle
in July 1858.[23] Darwin published a detailed account of his evidence and
conclusions in On_the_Origin_of_Species in 1859. In the 3rd edition of 1861
Darwin acknowledged that othersâlike William_Charles_Wells in 1813, and
Patrick_Matthew in 1831âhad proposed similar ideas, but had neither developed
them nor presented them in notable scientific publications.[24]
Charles_Darwin noted that pigeon_fanciers had created many kinds of pigeon,
such as Tumblers (1, 12), Fantails (13), and Pouters (14) by selective
breeding.
Darwin thought of natural selection by analogy to how farmers select crops or
livestock for breeding, which he called "artificial_selection"; in his early
manuscripts he referred to a "Nature" which would do the selection. At the
time, other mechanisms of evolution such as evolution by genetic drift were not
yet explicitly formulated, and Darwin believed that selection was likely only
part of the story: "I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but
not exclusive means of modification."[25] In a letter to Charles Lyell in
September 1860, Darwin regretted the use of the term "Natural Selection",
preferring the term "Natural Preservation".[26]
For Darwin and his contemporaries, natural selection was in essence synonymous
with evolution by natural selection. After the publication of On the Origin of
Species,[27] educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in
some form. However, natural selection remained controversial as a mechanism,
partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed
characteristics of living organisms, and partly because even supporters of
evolution balked at its "unguided" and non-progressive nature,[28] a response
that has been characterised as the single most significant impediment to the
idea's acceptance.[29] However, some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural
selection; after reading Darwin, Herbert_Spencer introduced the phrase survival
of_the_fittest, which became a popular summary of the theory.[30][31] The fifth
edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869 included Spencer's phrase
as an alternative to natural selection, with credit given: "But the expression
often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more
accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient."[32] Although the phrase is
still often used by non-biologists, modern biologists avoid it because it is
tautological if "fittest" is read to mean "functionally superior" and is
applied to individuals rather than considered as an averaged quantity over
populations.[33]
**** The modern synthesis[edit] ****
Main article: Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)
Natural selection relies crucially on the idea of heredity, but developed
before the basic concepts of genetics. Although the Moravian monk Gregor
Mendel, the father of modern genetics, was a contemporary of Darwin's, his work
lay in obscurity, only being rediscovered in 1900.[34] With the early 20th
century integration of evolution with Mendel's_laws of inheritance, the so-
called modern_synthesis, scientists generally came to accept natural selection.
[35][36] The synthesis grew from advances in different fields. Ronald Fisher
developed the required mathematical language and wrote The_Genetical_Theory_of
Natural_Selection (1930).[37] J._B._S._Haldane introduced the concept of the
"cost" of natural selection.[38][39] Sewall_Wright elucidated the nature of
selection and adaptation.[40] In his book Genetics_and_the_Origin_of_Species
(1937), Theodosius_Dobzhansky established the idea that mutation, once_seen_as
a_rival to selection, actually supplied the raw material for natural selection
by creating genetic diversity.[41][42]
**** A second synthesis[edit] ****
Evolutionary_developmental_biology relates the evolution of form to the precise
pattern of gene activity, here gap_genes in the fruit fly, during embryonic
development.[43]
Main article: Evolutionary_developmental_biology_Â§ History
Ernst_Mayr recognised the key importance of reproductive_isolation for
speciation in his Systematics_and_the_Origin_of_Species (1942).[44] W._D.
Hamilton conceived of kin_selection in 1964.[45][46] This synthesis cemented
natural selection as the foundation of evolutionary theory, where it remains
today. A second synthesis was brought about at the end of the 20th century by
advances in molecular_genetics, creating the field of evolutionary
developmental_biology ("evo-devo"), which seeks to explain the evolution of
form in terms of the genetic_regulatory_programs which control the development
of the embryo at molecular level. Natural selection is here understood to act
on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.[47][48]
[49][50]
***** Terminology[edit] *****
The term natural selection is most often defined to operate on heritable
traits, because these directly participate in evolution. However, natural
selection is "blind" in the sense that changes in phenotype can give a
reproductive advantage regardless of whether or not the trait is heritable.
Following Darwin's primary usage, the term is used to refer both to the
evolutionary consequence of blind selection and to its mechanisms.[27][37][51]
[52] It is sometimes helpful to explicitly distinguish between selection's
mechanisms and its effects; when this distinction is important, scientists
define "(phenotypic) natural selection" specifically as "those mechanisms that
contribute to the selection of individuals that reproduce", without regard to
whether the basis of the selection is heritable.[53][54][55] Traits that cause
greater reproductive success of an organism are said to be selected for, while
those that reduce success are selected against.[56]
***** Mechanism[edit] *****
**** Heritable variation, differential reproduction[edit] ****
During the industrial_revolution, pollution killed many lichens, leaving tree
trunks dark. A dark_(melanic) morph of the peppered_moth largely replaced the
formerly usual light morph (both shown here). Since the moths are subject to
predation by birds hunting by sight, the colour change offers better camouflage
against the changed background, suggesting natural selection at work.
Main article: Genetic_variation
Natural variation occurs among the individuals of any population of organisms.
Some differences may improve an individual's chances of surviving and
reproducing such that its lifetime reproductive rate is increased, which means
that it leaves more offspring. If the traits that give these individuals a
reproductive advantage are also heritable, that is, passed from parent to
offspring, then there will be differential reproduction, that is, a slightly
higher proportion of fast rabbits or efficient algae in the next generation.
Even if the reproductive advantage is very slight, over many generations any
advantageous heritable trait becomes dominant in the population. In this way
the natural_environment of an organism "selects for" traits that confer a
reproductive advantage, causing evolutionary change, as Darwin described.[57]
This gives the appearance of purpose, but in natural selection there is no
intentional choice.[a] Artificial selection is purposive where natural
selection is not, though biologists_often_use_teleological_language to describe
it.[58]
The peppered_moth exists in both light and dark colours in Great Britain, but
during the industrial_revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested
became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding
from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths a better chance of surviving to
produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark
moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark.
The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean_Air_Act_1956, and the dark
moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on
peppered_moth_evolution.[59] A recent study, using image analysis and avian
vision models, shows that pale individuals more closely match lichen
backgrounds than dark morphs and for the first time quantifies the camouflage
of moths to predation risk.[60]
**** Fitness[edit] ****
Main article: Fitness_(biology)
The concept of fitness is central to natural selection. In broad terms,
individuals that are more "fit" have better potential for survival, as in the
well-known phrase "survival_of_the_fittest", but the precise meaning of the
term is much more subtle. Modern evolutionary theory defines fitness not by how
long an organism lives, but by how successful it is at reproducing. If an
organism lives half as long as others of its species, but has twice as many
offspring surviving to adulthood, its genes become more common in the adult
population of the next generation. Though natural selection acts on
individuals, the effects of chance mean that fitness can only really be defined
"on average" for the individuals within a population. The fitness of a
particular genotype corresponds to the average effect on all individuals with
that genotype.[61] A distinction must be made between the concept of "survival
of the fittest" and "improvement in fitness". "Survival of the fittest" does
not give an "improvement in fitness", it only represents the removal of the
less fit variants from a population. A mathematical example of "survival of the
fittest" is given by Haldane in his paper "The Cost of Natural Selection".[62]
Haldane called this process "substitution" or more commonly in biology, this is
called "fixation". This is correctly described by the differential survival and
reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. On the other hand,
"improvement in fitness" is not dependent on the differential survival and
reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype, it is dependent on
the absolute survival of the particular variant. The probability of a
beneficial mutation occurring on some member of a population depends on the
total number of replications of that variant. The mathematics of "improvement
in fitness was described by Kleinman. [63] An empirical example of "improvement
in fitness" is given by the Kishony Mega-plate experiment. [64] In this
experiment, "improvement in fitness" depends on the number of replications of
the particular variant for a new variant to appear that is capable of growing
in the next higher drug concentration region. Fixation or substitution is not
required for this "improvement in fitness". On the other hand, "improvement in
fitness" can occur in an environment where "survival of the fittest" is also
acting. The classic Lenski "E. coli long-term evolution experiment" [65] is an
example of adaptation in a competitive environment, ("improvement in fitness"
during "survival of the fittest"). The probability of a beneficial mutation
occurring on some member of the lineage to give improved fitness is slowed by
the competition. The variant which is a candidate for a beneficial mutation in
this limited carrying capacity environment must first out-compete the "less
fit" variants in order to accumulate the requisite number of replications for
there to be a reasonable probability of that beneficial mutation occurring.
**** Competition[edit] ****
Main article: Competition_(biology)
In biology, competition is an interaction between organisms in which the
fitness of one is lowered by the presence of another. This may be because both
rely on a limited supply of a resource such as food, water, or territory.[66]
Competition may be within or between_species, and may be direct or indirect.
[67] Species less suited to compete should in_theory_either_adapt_or_die_out,
since competition plays a powerful role in natural selection, but according to
the "room to roam" theory it may be less important than expansion among larger
clades.[67][68]
Competition is modelled by r/K_selection_theory, which is based on Robert
MacArthur and E._O._Wilson's work on island_biogeography.[69] In this theory,
selective pressures drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: r- or
K-selection.[70] These terms, r and K, can be illustrated in a logistic_model
of population_dynamics:[71]
            d N   d t    = r N  (  1 &#x2212;   N K    )      {\displaystyle
      {\frac {dN}{dt}}=rN\left(1-{\frac {N}{K}}\right)\qquad \!}  [{\frac  {dN}
      {dt}}=rN\left(1-{\frac  {N}{K}}\right)\qquad \!]
where r is the growth_rate of the population (N), and K is the carrying
capacity of its local environmental setting. Typically, r-selected species
exploit empty niches, and produce many offspring, each with a relatively low
probability of surviving to adulthood. In contrast, K-selected species are
strong competitors in crowded niches, and invest more heavily in much fewer
offspring, each with a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood.
[71]
**** Types of selection[edit] ****
1: directional_selection: a single extreme phenotype favoured.
2, stabilizing_selection: intermediate favoured over extremes.
3: disruptive selection: extremes favoured over intermediate.
X-axis: phenotypic_trait
Y-axis: number of organisms
Group A: original population
Group B: after selection
Natural selection can act on any heritable phenotypic_trait,[72] and selective
pressure can be produced by any aspect of the environment, including sexual
selection and competition with members of the same or other species.[73][74]
However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and
results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the
maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.[57]
Selection can be classified in several different ways, such as by its effect on
a trait, on genetic diversity, by the life cycle stage where it acts, by the
unit of selection, or by the resource being competed for.
Selection has different effects on traits. Stabilizing_selection acts to hold a
trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this
optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional_selection favours extreme
values of a trait. The uncommon disruptive_selection also acts during
transition periods when the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait
in more than one direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and
univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive
selection can be a precursor to speciation.[57]
Alternatively, selection can be divided according to its effect on genetic
diversity. Purifying_or_negative_selection acts to remove genetic variation
from the population (and is opposed by de_novo_mutation, which introduces new
variation.[75][76] In contrast, balancing_selection acts to maintain genetic
variation in a population, even in the absence of de novo mutation, by negative
frequency-dependent_selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote
advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective
advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human
ABO_blood_group locus has been explained in this way.[77]
Different types of selection act at each life_cycle_stage of a sexually
reproducing organism.[78]
Another option is to classify selection by the life_cycle stage at which it
acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability_(or_survival)
selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and
fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the
rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further
components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined
separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival
before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be
split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic
selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on
zygote formation.[78]
Selection can also be classified by the level or unit_of_selection. Individual
selection acts on the individual, in the sense that adaptations are "for" the
benefit of the individual, and result from selection among individuals. Gene
selection acts directly at the level of the gene. In kin_selection and
intragenomic_conflict, gene-level selection provides a more apt explanation of
the underlying process. Group_selection, if it occurs, acts on groups of
organisms, on the assumption that groups replicate and mutate in an analogous
way to genes and individuals. There is an ongoing debate over the degree to
which group selection occurs in nature.[79]
Finally, selection can be classified according to the resource being competed
for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection
typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes at the expense of
viability. Ecological_selection is natural selection via any means other than
sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide.
Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological
selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.
[80]
*** Sexual selection[edit] ***
The peacock's elaborate plumage is mentioned by Darwin as an example of sexual
selection,[81] and is a classic example of Fisherian_runaway,[82] driven to its
conspicuous size and coloration through mate_choice by females over many
generations.
Main article: Sexual_selection
Sexual selection as first articulated by Darwin (using the example of the
peacock's tail)[81] refers specifically to competition for mates,[83] which can
be intrasexual, between individuals of the same sex, that is maleâmale
competition, or intersexual, where one gender chooses_mates, most often with
males displaying and females choosing.[84] However, in some species, mate
choice is primarily by males, as in some fishes of the family Syngnathidae.[85]
[86]
Phenotypic traits can be displayed in one sex and desired in the other sex,
causing a positive_feedback loop called a Fisherian_runaway, for example, the
extravagant plumage of some male birds such as the peacock.[82] An alternate
theory proposed by the same Ronald_Fisher in 1930 is the sexy_son_hypothesis,
that mothers want promiscuous sons to give them large numbers of grandchildren
and so choose promiscuous fathers for their children. Aggression between
members of the same sex is sometimes associated with very distinctive features,
such as the antlers of stags, which are used in combat with other stags. More
generally, intrasexual selection is often associated with sexual_dimorphism,
including differences in body size between males and females of a species.[84]
**** Natural selection in action[edit] ****
Selection in action: resistance_to_antibiotics grows though the survival of
individuals less affected by the antibiotic. Their offspring inherit the
resistance.
Further information: Antimicrobial_resistance
Natural selection is seen in action in the development of antibiotic_resistance
in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have
been used to fight bacterial diseases. The widespread misuse of antibiotics has
selected for microbial resistance to antibiotics in clinical use, to the point
that the methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus (MRSA) has been described
as a "superbug" because of the threat it poses to health and its relative
invulnerability to existing drugs.[87] Response strategies typically include
the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new strains of MRSA have
recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs.[88] This is an
evolutionary_arms_race, in which bacteria develop strains less susceptible to
antibiotics, while medical researchers attempt to develop new antibiotics that
can kill them. A similar situation occurs with pesticide_resistance in plants
and insects. Arms races are not necessarily induced by man; a well-documented
example involves the spread of a gene in the butterfly Hypolimnas_bolina
suppressing male-killing activity by Wolbachia bacteria parasites on the island
of Samoa, where the spread of the gene is known to have occurred over a period
of just five years[89][90]
***** Evolution by means of natural selection[edit] *****

mutant Hox_gene
Main articles: Evolution and Darwinism
A prerequisite for natural selection to result in adaptive evolution, novel
traits and speciation is the presence of heritable genetic variation that
results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations,
genetic_recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape,
size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might
have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large
effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were
considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding_DNA
or resulted in a synonymous_substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding
DNA have deleterious effects.[91][92] Although both mutation rates and average
fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of
mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.[93]
Some mutations occur in "toolkit"_or_regulatory_genes. Changes in these often
have large effects on the phenotype of the individual because they regulate the
function of many other genes. Most, but not all, mutations in regulatory genes
result in non-viable embryos. Some nonlethal regulatory mutations occur in HOX
genes in humans, which can result in a cervical_rib[94] or polydactyly, an
increase in the number of fingers or toes.[95] When such mutations result in a
higher fitness, natural selection favours these phenotypes and the novel trait
spreads in the population. Established traits are not immutable; traits that
have high fitness in one environmental context may be much less fit if
environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to
preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time,
possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called
evolutionary_baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure
may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous
traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial
structure, the eye of the blind_mole-rat, is believed to retain function in
photoperiod perception.[96]
**** Speciation[edit] ****
Main article: Speciation
Speciation requires a degree of reproductive_isolationâthat is, a reduction
in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic to the concept of a species that hybrids
are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a
problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric
speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with
different sets of mutations. E._B._Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive
isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a
different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the
heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the
BatesonâDobzhanskyâMuller_model, further elaborated by H._Allen_Orr[97] and
Sergey_Gavrilets.[98] With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor
an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation
directly.[99]
***** Genetic basis[edit] *****
**** Genotype and phenotype[edit] ****
Main article: Genotypeâphenotype_distinction
Natural selection acts on an organism's phenotype, or physical characteristics.
Phenotype is determined by an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and the
environment in which the organism lives. When different organisms in a
population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of
these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that
underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood_type antigens
in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.[100]
Some traits are governed by only a single gene, but most traits are influenced
by the interactions of many genes. A variation in one of the many genes that
contributes to a trait may have only a small effect on the phenotype; together,
these genes can produce a continuum of possible phenotypic values.[101]
**** Directionality of selection[edit] ****
Main article: Directional_selection
When some component of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies
of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of
the trait. Selection can be divided into three classes, on the basis of its
effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying
selection.[102] Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater
fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing
share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is fixed
and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype.[103] Far more common is
stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a
deleterious effect on the phenotypeâthat is, produce organisms of lower
fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the
population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as
protein-coding_genes or regulatory_sequences, over time by selective pressure
against deleterious variants.[104]
Some forms of balancing selection do not result in fixation, but maintain an
allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid
species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just
one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with
two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which
the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for
sickle-cell_anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through
disruptive_or_diversifying_selection, which favours genotypes that depart from
the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and
can result in a bimodal_distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing
selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of
one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the
population. The principles of game_theory have been applied to understand the
fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin
selection and the evolution of reciprocal_altruism.[105][106]
**** Selection, genetic variation, and drift[edit] ****
Main articles: Genetic_variation and Genetic_drift
A portion of all genetic variation is functionally neutral, producing no
phenotypic effect or significant difference in fitness. Motoo_Kimura's neutral
theory_of_molecular_evolution by genetic_drift proposes that this variation
accounts for a large fraction of observed genetic diversity.[107] Neutral
events can radically reduce genetic variation through population_bottlenecks.
[108] which among other things can cause the founder_effect in initially small
new populations.[109] When genetic variation does not result in differences in
fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a
result, the genetic variation at those sites is higher than at sites where
variation does influence fitness.[102] However, after a period with no new
mutations, the genetic variation at these sites is eliminated due to genetic
drift. Natural selection reduces genetic variation by eliminating maladapted
individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At
the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutationâselection
balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on the rate at
which new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which
is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.[110]
Genetic_linkage occurs when the loci of two alleles are in close proximity on a
chromosome. During the formation of gametes, recombination reshuffles the
alleles. The chance that such a reshuffle occurs between two alleles is
inversely related to the distance between them. Selective_sweeps occur when an
allele becomes more common in a population as a result of positive selection.
As the prevalence of one allele increases, closely linked alleles can also
become more common by "genetic_hitchhiking", whether they are neutral or even
slightly deleterious. A strong selective sweep results in a region of the
genome where the positively selected haplotype (the allele and its neighbours)
are in essence the only ones that exist in the population. Selective sweeps can
be detected by measuring linkage_disequilibrium, or whether a given haplotype
is overrepresented in the population. Since a selective sweep also results in
selection of neighbouring alleles, the presence of a block of strong linkage
disequilibrium might indicate a 'recent' selective sweep near the centre of the
block.[111]
Background_selection is the opposite of a selective sweep. If a specific site
experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends
to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall
variability. Because background selection is a result of deleterious new
mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear
blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still
lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.[112]
***** Impact[edit] *****
Main article: Universal_Darwinism
Darwin's ideas, along with those of Adam_Smith and Karl_Marx, had a profound
influence on 19th century thought, including his radical claim that
"elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on
each other in so complex a manner" evolved from the simplest forms of life by a
few simple principles.[113] This inspired some of Darwin's most ardent
supportersâand provoked the strongest opposition. Natural selection had the
power, according to Stephen_Jay_Gould, to "dethrone some of the deepest and
most traditional comforts of Western thought", such as the belief that humans
have a special place in the world.[114]
In the words of the philosopher Daniel_Dennett, "Darwin's dangerous idea" of
evolution by natural selection is a "universal acid," which cannot be kept
restricted to any vessel or container, as it soon leaks out, working its way
into ever-wider surroundings.[115] Thus, in the last decades, the concept of
natural selection has spread from evolutionary_biology to other disciplines,
including evolutionary_computation, quantum_Darwinism, evolutionary_economics,
evolutionary_epistemology, evolutionary_psychology, and cosmological_natural
selection. This unlimited applicability has been called universal_Darwinism.
[116]
**** Origin of life[edit] ****
Main article: Abiogenesis
How life originated from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in
biology. One prominent hypothesis is that life first appeared in_the_form_of
short_self-replicating_RNA polymers.[117] On this view, life may have come into
existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived
by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are:
heritability, variation_of_type, and competition for limited resources. The
fitness of an early RNA_replicator would likely have been a function of
adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide
sequence) and the availability of resources.[118][119] The three primary
adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate
with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of
type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and
process resources.[118][119] These capacities would have been determined
initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with
ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been
encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.[120]
**** Cell and molecular biology[edit] ****
In 1881, the embryologist Wilhelm_Roux published Der Kampf der Theile im
Organismus (The Struggle of Parts in the Organism) in which he suggested that
the development of an organism results from a Darwinian competition between the
parts of the embryo, occurring at all levels, from molecules to organs.[121] In
recent years, a modern version of this theory has been proposed by Jean-Jacques
Kupiec. According to this cellular Darwinism, random_variation at the molecular
level generates diversity in cell types whereas cell interactions impose a
characteristic order on the developing embryo.[122]
**** Social and psychological theory[edit] ****
The social implications of the theory of evolution by natural selection also
became the source of continuing controversy. Friedrich_Engels, a German
political_philosopher and co-originator of the ideology of communism, wrote in
1872 that "Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind, and
especially on his countrymen, when he showed that free competition, the
struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest
historical achievement, is the normal state of the animal kingdom."[123]
Herbert Spencer and the eugenics advocate Francis_Galton's interpretation of
natural selection as necessarily progressive, leading to supposed advances in
intelligence and civilisation, became a justification for colonialism,
eugenics, and social_Darwinism. For example, in 1940, Konrad_Lorenz, in
writings that he subsequently disowned, used the theory as a justification for
policies of the Nazi state. He wrote "... selection for toughness, heroism, and
social utility ... must be accomplished by some human institution, if mankind,
in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced
degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has already accomplished
much in this respect."[124] Others have developed ideas that human societies
and culture evolve by mechanisms analogous to those that apply to evolution of
species.[125]
More recently, work among anthropologists and psychologists has led to the
development of sociobiology and later of evolutionary psychology, a field that
attempts to explain features of human_psychology in terms of adaptation to the
ancestral environment. The most prominent example of evolutionary psychology,
notably advanced in the early work of Noam_Chomsky and later by Steven_Pinker,
is the hypothesis that the human brain has adapted to acquire the grammatical
rules of natural_language.[126] Other aspects of human behaviour and social
structures, from specific cultural norms such as incest_avoidance to broader
patterns such as gender_roles, have been hypothesised to have similar origins
as adaptations to the early environment in which modern humans evolved. By
analogy to the action of natural selection on genes, the concept of
memesâ"units of cultural transmission," or culture's equivalents of genes
undergoing selection and recombinationâhas arisen, first described in this
form by Richard_Dawkins in 1976[127] and subsequently expanded upon by
philosophers such as Daniel_Dennett as explanations for complex cultural
activities, including human consciousness.[128]
**** Information and systems theory[edit] ****
In 1922, Alfred_J._Lotka proposed that natural selection might be understood as
a physical principle that could be described in terms of the use of energy by a
system,[129][130] a concept later developed by Howard_T._Odum as the maximum
power_principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective
advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.[131]
The principles of natural selection have inspired a variety of computational
techniques, such as "soft" artificial_life, that simulate selective processes
and can be highly efficient in 'adapting' entities to an environment defined by
a specified fitness_function.[132] For example, a class of heuristic
optimisation algorithms known as genetic_algorithms, pioneered by John_Henry
Holland in the 1970s and expanded upon by David_E._Goldberg,[133] identify
optimal solutions by simulated reproduction and mutation of a population of
solutions defined by an initial probability_distribution.[134] Such algorithms
are particularly useful when applied to problems whose energy_landscape is very
rough or has many local minima.[135]
**** In fiction[edit] ****
Main article: Evolution_in_fiction
Darwinian evolution by natural selection is pervasive in literature, whether
taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or
pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human
nature and the struggle for survival. Among major responses is Samuel_Butler's
1872 pessimistic Erewhon ("nowhere", written mostly backwards). In 1893 H._G.
Wells imagined "The_Man_of_the_Year_Million", transformed by natural selection
into a being with a huge head and eyes, and shrunken body.[136]
***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ In sexual_selection, a female animal making a choice of mate may be
      argued to be intending to get the best mate; there is no suggestion that
      she has any intention to improve the bloodline in the manner of an animal
      breeder.
