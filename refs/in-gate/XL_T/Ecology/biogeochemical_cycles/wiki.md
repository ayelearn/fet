In ecology and Earth_science, a biogeochemical cycle or substance turnover or
cycling of substances is a pathway by which a chemical_substance moves through
biotic (biosphere) and abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere)
compartments of Earth. There are biogeochemical cycles for the chemical
elements calcium, carbon, hydrogen, mercury, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus,
selenium, and sulfur; molecular cycles for water and silica; macroscopic cycles
such as the rock_cycle; as well as human-induced cycles for synthetic compounds
such as polychlorinated_biphenyl (PCB). In some cycles there are reservoirs
where a substance remains for a long period of time (such as an ocean or lake
for water).

***** Systems[edit] *****
Chloroplasts conduct photosynthesis and are found in plant_cells and other
eukaryotic organisms. These are Chloroplasts visible in the cells of
Plagiomnium affine â Many-fruited Thyme-moss.
Ecological systems (ecosystems) have many biogeochemical cycles operating as a
part of the system, for example the water cycle, the carbon cycle, the nitrogen
cycle, etc. All chemical elements occurring in organisms are part of
biogeochemical cycles. In addition to being a part of living organisms, these
chemical elements also cycle through abiotic factors of ecosystems such as
water (hydrosphere), land (lithosphere), and/or the air (atmosphere).[1]
The living factors of the planet can be referred to collectively as the
biosphere. All the nutrientsâsuch as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus,
and sulfurâused in ecosystems by living organisms are a part of a closed
system; therefore, these chemicals are recycled instead of being lost and
replenished constantly such as in an open system.[1]
The flow of energy in an ecosystem is an open system; the sun constantly gives
the planet energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in
the form of heat throughout the trophic_levels of a food web. Carbon is used to
make carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, the major sources of food_energy. These
compounds are oxidized to release carbon dioxide, which can be captured by
plants to make organic compounds. The chemical_reaction is powered by the light
energy of the sun.
Sunlight is required to combine carbon with hydrogen and oxygen into an energy
source, but ecosystems in the deep_sea, where no sunlight can penetrate, obtain
energy from sulfur. Hydrogen_sulfide near hydrothermal_vents can be utilized by
organisms such as the giant_tube_worm. In the sulfur_cycle, sulfur can be
forever recycled as a source of energy. Energy can be released through the
oxidation and reduction of sulfur compounds (e.g., oxidizing elemental sulfur
to sulfite and then to sulfate).
Although the Earth constantly receives energy from the sun, its chemical
composition is essentially fixed, as additional matter is only occasionally
added by meteorites. Because this chemical composition is not replenished like
energy, all processes that depend on these chemicals must be recycled. These
cycles include both the living biosphere and the nonliving lithosphere,
atmosphere, and hydrosphere.
***** Reservoirs[edit] *****
Coal is a reservoir of carbon.
The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place. This
place is called a reservoir, which, for example, includes such things as coal
deposits that are storing carbon for a long period of time.[2] When chemicals
are held for only short periods of time, they are being held in exchange pools.
Examples of exchange pools include plants and animals.[2]
Plants and animals utilize carbon to produce carbohydrates, fats, and proteins,
which can then be used to build their internal structures or to obtain energy.
Plants and animals temporarily use carbon in their systems and then release it
back into the air or surrounding medium. Generally, reservoirs are abiotic
factors whereas exchange pools are biotic factors. Carbon is held for a
relatively short time in plants and animals in comparison to coal deposits. The
amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called its residence
time.[2]

There are many biogeochemical cycles that are currently being studied for the
first time as climate_change and human impacts are drastically changing the
speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles. These newly
studied biogeochemical cycles include
    * the mercury_cycle,[3] and
    * the human-caused cycle of PCBs.[4]
Biogeochemical cycles always involve hot equilibrium states: a balance in the
cycling of the element between compartments. However, overall balance may
involve compartments distributed on a global scale.
As biogeochemical cycles describe the movements of substances on the entire
globe, the study of these is inherently multidisciplinary. The carbon cycle may
be related to research in ecology and atmospheric_sciences.[5] Biochemical
dynamics would also be related to the fields of geology and pedology.[6]
