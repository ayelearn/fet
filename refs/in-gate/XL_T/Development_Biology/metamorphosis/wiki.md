A dragonfly in its final moult, undergoing metamorphosis from its nymph form to
an adult
Metamorphosis is a biological_process by which an animal physically develops
after birth or hatching, involving a conspicuous and relatively abrupt change
in the animal's body structure through cell growth and differentiation. Some
insects, fishes, amphibians, mollusks, crustaceans, cnidarians, echinoderms,
and tunicates undergo metamorphosis, which is often accompanied by a change of
nutrition source or behavior. Animals can be divided into species that undergo
complete metamorphosis ("holometaboly"), incomplete metamorphosis
("hemimetaboly"), or no metamorphosis ("ametaboly").
Scientific usage of the term is technically precise, and it is not applied to
general aspects of cell_growth, including rapid growth_spurts. References to
"metamorphosis" in mammals are imprecise and only colloquial, but historically
idealist ideas of transformation and monadology, as in Goethe's Metamorphosis
of_Plants, have influenced the development of ideas of evolution.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word metamorphosis derives from Greek Î¼ÎµÏÎ±Î¼ÏÏÏÏÏÎ¹Ï,
"transformation, transforming",[1] from Î¼ÎµÏÎ±- (meta-), "after" and
Î¼Î¿ÏÏÎ® (morphe), "form".[2]
***** Hormonal control[edit] *****
Metamorphosis is iodothyronine-induced and an ancestral feature of all
chordates.[3]
In insects growth and metamorphosis are controlled by hormones synthesized by
endocrine_glands near the front of the body (anterior). Neurosecretory cells in
an insect's_brain secrete a hormone, the prothoracicotropic_hormone (PTTH) that
activates prothoracic glands, which secrete a second hormone, usually ecdysone
(an ecdysteroid), that induces ecdysis.[4] PTTH also stimulates the corpora
allata, a retrocerebral organ, to produce juvenile_hormone, which prevents the
development of adult characteristics during ecdysis. In holometabolous insects,
molts between larval instars have a high level of juvenile hormone, the moult
to the pupal stage has a low level of juvenile hormone, and the final, or
imaginal, molt has no juvenile hormone present at all.[5] Experiments on
firebugs have shown how juvenile hormone can affect the number of nymph instar
stages in hemimetabolous insects.[6][7]
***** Insects[edit] *****
Incomplete metamorphosis in the grasshopper with different instar nymphs
All three categories of metamorphosis can be found in the diversity of insects,
including no metamorphosis ("ametaboly"), incomplete or partial metamorphosis
("hemimetaboly"), and complete metamorphosis ("holometaboly"). While
ametabolous insects show very little difference between larval and adult forms
(also known as "direct_development"), both hemimetabolous and holometabolous
insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between
larval and adult forms, the most significant being the inclusion, in
holometabolus organisms, of a pupal or resting stage between the larval and
adult forms.
**** Development and terminology[edit] ****
Two types of metamorphosis are shown. In a complete (holometabolous)
metamorphosis the insect passes through four distinct phases, which produce an
adult that does not resemble the larva. In an incomplete (hemimetabolous)
metamorphosis an insect does not go through a full transformation, but instead
transitions from a nymph to an adult by molting its exoskeleton as it grows.
In hemimetabolous insects, immature stages are called nymphs. Development
proceeds in repeated stages of growth and ecdysis (moulting); these stages are
called instars. The juvenile forms closely resemble adults, but are smaller and
lack adult features such as wings and genitalia. The size and morphological
differences between nymphs in different instars are small, often just
differences in body proportions and the number of segments; in later instars,
external wing buds form.
In holometabolous insects, immature stages are called larvae and differ
markedly from adults. Insects which undergo holometabolism pass through a
larval stage, then enter an inactive state called pupa (called a "chrysalis" in
butterfly species), and finally emerge as adults.[8]
**** Evolution[edit] ****
The earliest insect forms showed direct development (ametabolism), and the
evolution of metamorphosis in insects is thought to have fuelled their dramatic
radiation (1,2). Some early ametabolous "true insects" are still present today,
such as bristletails and silverfish. Hemimetabolous insects include
cockroaches, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and true bugs. Phylogenetically, all
insects in the Pterygota undergo a marked change in form, texture and physical
appearance from immature stage to adult. These insects either have
hemimetabolous development, and undergo an incomplete or partial metamorphosis,
or holometabolous development, which undergo a complete metamorphosis,
including a pupal or resting stage between the larval and adult forms.[9]
A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of
holometaboly from hemimetaboly, mostly centering on whether or not the
intermediate hemimetabolous forms are homologous to pupal form of
holometabolous forms.
More recently,[when?] scientific attention has turned to characterizing the
mechanistic basis of metamorphosis in terms of its hormonal control, by
characterizing spatial and temporal patterns of hormone expression relative to
metamorphosis in a wide range of insects.
**** Recent research[edit] ****
According to research from 2008, adult Manduca_sexta is able to retain behavior
learned as a caterpillar.[10] Another caterpillar, the_ornate_moth_caterpillar,
is able to carry toxins that it acquires from its diet through metamorphosis
and into adulthood, where the toxins still serve for protection against
predators.[11]
Many observations[when?] have indicated that programmed_cell_death plays a
considerable role during physiological processes of multicellular organisms,
particularly during embryogenesis and metamorphosis.[12][13]
Below are the sequence of the metamorphosis of the butterfly (illustrated)

***** Chordata[edit] *****
**** Amphioxus[edit] ****
In cephalochordata, metamorphosis is iodothyronine-induced and it could be an
ancestral feature of all chordates.[3]
**** Fish[edit] ****
Some fish, both bony_fish_(Osteichthyes) and jawless_fish_(Agnatha), undergo
metamorphosis. Fish metamorphosis is typically under strong control by the
thyroid hormone.[14]
Examples among the non-bony fish include the lamprey. Among the bony fish,
mechanisms are varied.
The salmon is diadromous, meaning that it changes from a freshwater to a
saltwater lifestyle.
Many species of flatfish begin their life bilaterally_symmetrical, with an eye
on either side of the body; but one eye moves to join the other side of the
fish â which becomes the upper side â in the adult form.
The European_eel has a number of metamorphoses, from the larval stage to the
leptocephalus stage, then a quick metamorphosis to glass eel at the edge of the
continental shelf (eight days for the Japanese_eel), two months at the border
of fresh and salt water where the glass eel undergoes a quick metamorphosis
into elver, then a long stage of growth followed by a more gradual
metamorphosis to the migrating phase. In the pre-adult freshwater stage, the
eel also has phenotypic_plasticity because fish-eating eels develop very wide
mandibles, making the head look blunt. Leptocephali are common, occurring in
all Elopomorpha (tarpon- and eel-like fish).
Most other bony fish undergo metamorphosis from embryo to larva (fry) and then
to the juvenile stage during absorption of the yolk sac, because after that
phase the individual needs to be able to feed for itself.[15][16]
**** Amphibians[edit] ****
Just before metamorphosis, only 24 hours are needed to reach the stage in the
next picture.
Almost functional common_frog with some remains of the gill sac and a not fully
developed jaw
In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted
to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads, and newts all hatch from the eggs as
larvae with external gills but it will take some time for the amphibians to
interact outside with pulmonary respiration. Afterwards, newt larvae start a
predatory lifestyle, while tadpoles mostly scrape food off surfaces with their
horny tooth ridges.
Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxin concentration in the
blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and prolactin, which counteracts its
effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different
tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body,
development is subject to many adaptations due to specific ecological
circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges for teeth,
whiskers, and fins. They also make use of the lateral_line organ. After
metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be resorbed by controlled
cell death, called apoptosis. The amount of adaptation to specific ecological
circumstances is remarkable, with many discoveries still being made.
*** Frogs and toads[edit] ***
With frogs and toads, the external gills of the newly hatched tadpole are
covered with a gill sac after a few days, and lungs are quickly formed. Front
legs are formed under the gill sac, and hindlegs are visible a few days later.
Following that there is usually a longer stage during which the tadpole lives
off a vegetarian diet. Tadpoles use a relatively long, spiralâshaped gut to
digest that diet.
Rapid changes in the body can then be observed as the lifestyle of the frog
changes completely. The spiralâshaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is
resorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a big jaw, and its
gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, a tongue
is formed, and all this is accompanied by associated changes in the neural
networks (development of stereoscopic vision, loss of the lateral line system,
etc.) All this can happen in about a day, so it is truly a metamorphosis. It is
not until a few days later that the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher
thyroxin concentrations required for tail resorption.
*** Salamanders[edit] ***
The Salamander development is highly diverse; some species go through a
dramatic reorganization when transitioning from aquatic larvae to terrestrial
adults, while others, such as the Axolotl, display paedomorphosis and never
develop into terrestrial adults. Within the genus Ambystoma, species have
evolved to be paedomorphic several times, and paedomorphosis and complete
development can both occur in some species.[14]
*** Newts[edit] ***
The large external gills of the crested_newt
In newts, there is no true metamorphosis[citation_needed] because newt larvae
already feed as predators and continue doing so as adults. Newts' gills are
never covered by a gill sac and will be resorbed only just before the animal
leaves the water. Just as in tadpoles, their lungs are functional early, but
newts use them less frequently than tadpoles[citation_needed]. Newts often have
an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For
adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for
adaptation to the land phase, thyroxin. External gills do not return in
subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving
the water for the first time.
*** Caecilians[edit] ***
Basal caecilians such as Ichthyophis go through a metamorphosis in which
aquatic larva transition into fossorial adults, which involves a loss of the
lateral_line.[17] More recently diverged caecilians (the Teresomata) do not
undergo an ontogenetic niche shift of this sort and are in general fossorial
throughout their lives. Thus, most caecilians do not undergo an anuran-like
metamorphosis.[18]
