[edit_on_Wikidata]
The central nervous system (CNS) is the part of the nervous_system consisting
of the brain and spinal_cord. The CNS is so named because it integrates the
received information and coordinates and influences the activity of all parts
of the bodies of bilaterally_symmetric_animalsâthat is, all multicellular
animals except sponges and radially_symmetric_animals such as jellyfishâand
it contains the majority of the nervous system. Many consider the retina[2] and
the optic_nerve (cranial_nerve II),[3][4] as well as the olfactory_nerves
(cranial nerve I) and olfactory_epithelium[5] as parts of the CNS, synapsing
directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia. As such, the olfactory
epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the
environment, which opens up for therapeutic treatments. [5] The CNS is
contained within the dorsal_body_cavity, with the brain housed in the cranial
cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal_canal. In vertebrates, the brain is
protected by the skull, while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae.[6]
The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges.[6] Within the CNS,
the interneuronal space is filled with a large amount of supporting non-nervous
cells called neuroglial cells.

***** Structure[edit] *****
Main article: Neuroanatomy
The CNS consists of the two major structures: the brain and spinal_cord. The
brain is encased in the skull, and protected by the cranium.[7] The spinal cord
is continuous with the brain and lies caudally to the brain.[8] It is protected
by the vertebrae.[7] The spinal cord reaches from the base of the skull,
continues through[7] or starting below[9] the foramen_magnum,[7] and terminates
roughly level with the first or second lumbar_vertebra,[8][9] occupying the
upper sections of the vertebral_canal.[4]
**** White and gray matter[edit] ****
Main articles: Gray_matter and White_matter
Dissection of a brain with labels showing the clear division between white and
gray matter.
Microscopically, there are differences between the neurons and tissue of the
CNS and the peripheral_nervous_system (PNS).[citation_needed] The CNS is
composed of white and gray_matter.[8] This can also be seen macroscopically on
brain tissue. The white matter consists of axons and oligodendrocytes, while
the gray matter consists of neurons and unmyelinated fibers. Both tissues
include a number of glial cells (although the white matter contains more),
which are often referred to as supporting cells of the CNS. Different forms of
glial cells have different functions, some acting almost as scaffolding for
neuroblasts to climb during neurogenesis such as bergmann_glia, while others
such as microglia are a specialized form of macrophage, involved in the immune
system of the brain as well as the clearance of various metabolites from the
brain_tissue.[4] Astrocytes may be involved with both clearance of metabolites
as well as transport of fuel and various beneficial substances to neurons from
the capillaries of the brain. Upon CNS injury astrocytes will proliferate,
causing gliosis, a form of neuronal scar tissue, lacking in functional neurons.
[4]
The brain (cerebrum as well as midbrain and hindbrain) consists of a cortex,
composed of neuron-bodies constituting gray matter, while internally there is
more white matter that form tracts and commissures. Apart from cortical gray
matter there is also subcortical_gray_matter making up a large number of
different nuclei.[8]
**** Spinal cord[edit] ****
Main article: Spinal_cord
Diagram of the columns and of the course of the fibers in the spinal cord.
Sensory synapses occur in the dorsal spinal cord (above in this image), and
motor nerves leave through the ventral (as well as lateral) horns of the spinal
cord as seen below in the image.
Different ways in which the CNS can be activated without engaging the cortex,
and making us aware of the actions. The above example shows the process in
which the pupil dilates during dim light, activating neurons in the spinal
cord. The second example shows the constriction of the pupil as a result of the
activation of the Eddinger-Westphal nucleus (a cerebral ganglion).
From and to the spinal cord are projections of the peripheral nervous system in
the form of spinal nerves (sometimes segmental nerves[7]). The nerves connect
the spinal cord to skin, joints, muscles etc. and allow for the transmission of
efferent motor as well as afferent_sensory_signals and stimuli.[8] This allows
for voluntary and involuntary motions of muscles, as well as the perception of
senses. All in all 31 spinal nerves project from the brain stem,[8] some
forming plexa as they branch out, such as the brachial_plexa, sacral_plexa etc.
[7] Each spinal nerve will carry both sensory and motor signals, but the nerves
synapse at different regions of the spinal cord, either from the periphery to
sensory relay neurons that relay the information to the CNS or from the CNS to
motor neurons, which relay the information out.[8]
The spinal cord relays information up to the brain through spinal tracts
through the "final common pathway"[8] to the thalamus and ultimately to the
cortex.
    * Schematic image showing the locations of a few tracts of the spinal cord.
    * Reflexes may also occur without engaging more than one neuron of the CNS
      as in the below example of a short reflex.
*** Cranial nerves[edit] ***
Apart from the spinal cord, there are also peripheral nerves of the PNS that
synapse through intermediaries or ganglia directly on the CNS. These 12 nerves
exist in the head and neck region and are called cranial_nerves. Cranial nerves
bring information to the CNS to and from the face, as well as to certain
muscles (such as the trapezius_muscle, which is innervated by accessory_nerves
[7] as well as certain cervical_spinal_nerves).[7]
Two pairs of cranial nerves; the olfactory_nerves and the optic_nerves[2] are
often considered structures of the CNS. This is because they do not synapse
first on peripheral ganglia, but directly on CNS neurons. The olfactory
epithelium is significant in that it consists of CNS tissue expressed in direct
contact to the environment, allowing for administration of certain
pharmaceuticals and drugs. [5]

**** Brain[edit] ****
Main article: Brain
Rostrally to the spinal cord lies the brain.[8] The brain makes up the largest
portion of the CNS. It is often the main structure referred to when speaking of
the nervous system in general. The brain is the major functional unit of the
CNS. While the spinal cord has certain processing ability such as that of
spinal_locomotion and can process reflexes, the brain is the major processing
unit of the nervous system.[10][citation_needed]
*** Brainstem[edit] ***
Main article: Brainstem
The brainstem consists of the medulla, the pons and the midbrain. The medulla
can be referred to as an extension of the spinal cord, which both have similar
organization and functional properties.[8] The tracts passing from the spinal
cord to the brain pass through here.[8]
Regulatory functions of the medulla nuclei include control of blood_pressure
and breathing. Other nuclei are involved in balance, taste, hearing, and
control of muscles of the face and neck.[8]
The next structure rostral to the medulla is the pons, which lies on the
ventral anterior side of the brainstem. Nuclei in the pons include pontine
nuclei which work with the cerebellum and transmit information between the
cerebellum and the cerebral_cortex.[8] In the dorsal posterior pons lie nuclei
that are involved in the functions of breathing, sleep, and taste.[8]
The midbrain, or mesencephalon, is situated above and rostral to the pons. It
includes nuclei linking distinct parts of the motor system, including the
cerebellum, the basal_ganglia and both cerebral_hemispheres, among others.
Additionally, parts of the visual and auditory systems are located in the
midbrain, including control of automatic eye movements.[8]
The brainstem at large provides entry and exit to the brain for a number of
pathways for motor and autonomic control of the face and neck through cranial
nerves,[8] Autonomic control of the organs is mediated by the tenth cranial
nerve.[4] A large portion of the brainstem is involved in such autonomic
control of the body. Such functions may engage the heart, blood_vessels, and
pupils, among others.[8]
The brainstem also holds the reticular_formation, a group of nuclei involved in
both arousal and alertness.[8]
*** Cerebellum[edit] ***
Main article: Cerebellum
The cerebellum lies behind the pons. The cerebellum is composed of several
dividing fissures and lobes. Its function includes the control of posture and
the coordination of movements of parts of the body, including the eyes and
head, as well as the limbs. Further, it is involved in motion that has been
learned and perfected though practice, and it will adapt to new learned
movements.[8] Despite its previous classification as a motor structure, the
cerebellum also displays connections to areas of the cerebral cortex involved
in language and cognition. These connections have been shown by the use of
medical_imaging techniques, such as functional_MRI and Positron_emission
tomography.[8]
The body of the cerebellum holds more neurons than any other structure of the
brain, including that of the larger cerebrum, but is also more extensively
understood than other structures of the brain, as it includes fewer types of
different neurons.[8] It handles and processes sensory stimuli, motor
information, as well as balance information from the vestibular_organ.[8]
*** Diencephalon[edit] ***
Main articles: Diencephalon, Thalamus, and Hypothalamus
The two structures of the diencephalon worth noting are the thalamus and the
hypothalamus. The thalamus acts as a linkage between incoming pathways from the
peripheral nervous system as well as the optical nerve (though it does not
receive input from the olfactory nerve) to the cerebral hemispheres. Previously
it was considered only a "relay station", but it is engaged in the sorting of
information that will reach cerebral hemispheres (neocortex).[8]
Apart from its function of sorting information from the periphery, the thalamus
also connects the cerebellum and basal ganglia with the cerebrum. In common
with the aforementioned reticular system the thalamus is involved in
wakefullness and consciousness, such as though the SCN.[8]
The hypothalamus engages in functions of a number of primitive emotions or
feelings such as hunger, thirst and maternal_bonding. This is regulated partly
through control of secretion of hormones from the pituitary_gland. Additionally
the hypothalamus plays a role in motivation and many other behaviors of the
individual.[8]
*** Cerebrum[edit] ***
Main articles: Cerebrum, Cerebral_cortex, Basal_ganglia, Amygdala, and
Hippocampus
The cerebrum of cerebral hemispheres make up the largest visual portion of the
human brain. Various structures combine to form the cerebral hemispheres, among
others: the cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus. The hemispheres
together control a large portion of the functions of the human brain such as
emotion, memory, perception and motor functions. Apart from this the cerebral
hemispheres stand for the cognitive capabilities of the brain.[8]
Connecting each of the hemispheres is the corpus_callosum as well as several
additional commissures.[8] One of the most important parts of the cerebral
hemispheres is the cortex, made up of gray matter covering the surface of the
brain. Functionally, the cerebral cortex is involved in planning and carrying
out of everyday tasks.[8]
The hippocampus is involved in storage of memories, the amygdala plays a role
in perception and communication of emotion, while the basal ganglia play a
major role in the coordination of voluntary movement.[8]
**** Difference from the peripheral nervous system[edit] ****
A map over the different structures of the nervous systems in the body, showing
the CNS, PNS, autonomic_nervous_system, and enteric_nervous_system.
This differentiates the CNS from the PNS, which consists of neurons, axons, and
Schwann_cells. Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells have similar functions in the
CNS and PNS, respectively. Both act to add myelin sheaths to the axons, which
acts as a form of insulation allowing for better and faster proliferation of
electrical signals along the nerves. Axons in the CNS are often very short,
barely a few millimeters, and do not need the same degree of isolation as
peripheral nerves. Some peripheral nerves can be over 1 meter in length, such
as the nerves to the big toe. To ensure signals move at sufficient speed,
myelination is needed.
The way in which the Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes myelinate nerves
differ. A Schwann cell usually myelinates a single axon, completely surrounding
it. Sometimes, they may myelinate many axons, especially when in areas of short
axons.[7] Oligodendrocytes usually myelinate several axons. They do this by
sending out thin projections of their cell_membrane, which envelop and enclose
the axon.
***** Development[edit] *****

Main article: Neural_development
During early development of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal groove on the
neural_plate gradually deepens and the ridges on either side of the groove (the
neural_folds) become elevated, and ultimately meet, transforming the groove
into a closed tube called the neural_tube.[11] The formation of the neural tube
is called neurulation. At this stage, the walls of the neural tube contain
proliferating neural_stem_cells in a region called the ventricular_zone. The
neural stem cells, principally radial_glial_cells, multiply and generate
neurons through the process of neurogenesis, forming the rudiment of the CNS.
[12]
The neural_tube gives rise to both brain and spinal_cord. The anterior (or
'rostral') portion of the neural tube initially differentiates into three brain
vesicles (pockets): the prosencephalon at the front, the mesencephalon, and,
between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the rhombencephalon. (By six
weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the
telencephalon and diencephalon; and the rhombencephalon divides into the
metencephalon and myelencephalon. The spinal cord is derived from the posterior
or 'caudal' portion of the neural tube.
As a vertebrate grows, these vesicles differentiate further still. The
telencephalon differentiates into, among other things, the striatum, the
hippocampus and the neocortex, and its cavity becomes the first_and_second
ventricles. Diencephalon elaborations include the subthalamus, hypothalamus,
thalamus and epithalamus, and its cavity forms the third_ventricle. The tectum,
pretectum, cerebral_peduncle and other structures develop out of the
mesencephalon, and its cavity grows into the mesencephalic_duct (cerebral
aqueduct). The metencephalon becomes, among other things, the pons and the
cerebellum, the myelencephalon forms the medulla_oblongata, and their cavities
develop into the fourth_ventricle.[8]

*** Planaria[edit] ***
Planarians, members of the phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms), have the
simplest, clearly defined delineation of a nervous system into a CNS and a PNS.
[13][14] Their primitive brains, consisting of two fused anterior ganglia, and
longitudinal nerve cords form the CNS; the laterally projecting nerves form the
PNS. A molecular study found that more than 95% of the 116 genes involved in
the nervous system of planarians, which includes genes related to the CNS, also
exist in humans.[15] Like planarians, vertebrates have a distinct CNS and PNS,
though more complex than those of planarians.
*** Arthropoda[edit] ***
In arthropods, the ventral_nerve_cord, the subesophageal_ganglia and the
supraesophageal_ganglia are usually seen as making up the CNS.
See also: Lateral_horn_of_insect_brain
*** Chordata[edit] ***
The CNS of chordates differs from that of other animals in being placed
dorsally in the body, above the gut and notochord/spine.[16] The basic pattern
of the CNS is highly conserved throughout the different species of vertebrates
and during evolution. The major trend that can be observed is towards a
progressive telencephalisation: the telencephalon of reptiles is only an
appendix to the large olfactory_bulb, while in mammals it makes up most of the
volume of the CNS. In the human brain, the telencephalon covers most of the
diencephalon and the mesencephalon. Indeed, the allometric study of brain size
among different species shows a striking continuity from rats to whales, and
allows us to complete the knowledge about the evolution of the CNS obtained
through cranial_endocasts.
** Mammals[edit] **
Mammals â which appear in the fossil record after the first fishes,
amphibians, and reptiles â are the only vertebrates to possess the
evolutionarily recent, outermost part of the cerebral_cortex known as the
neocortex.[17] The neocortex of monotremes (the duck-billed platypus and
several species of spiny_anteaters) and of marsupials (such as kangaroos,
koalas, opossums, wombats, and Tasmanian_devils) lack the convolutions â gyri
and sulci â found in the neocortex of most placental_mammals (eutherians).
[18] Within placental mammals, the size and complexity of the neocortex
increased over time. The area of the neocortex of mice is only about 1/100 that
of monkeys, and that of monkeys is only about 1/10 that of humans.[17] In
addition, rats lack convolutions in their neocortex (possibly also because rats
are small mammals), whereas cats have a moderate degree of convolutions, and
humans have quite extensive convolutions.[17] Extreme convolution of the
neocortex is found in dolphins, possibly related to their complex echolocation.
***** Clinical significance[edit] *****
**** Diseases[edit] ****
Main article: Central_nervous_system_disease
There are many CNS diseases and conditions, including infections such as
encephalitis and poliomyelitis, early-onset neurological_disorders including
ADHD and autism, late-onset neurodegenerative_diseases such as Alzheimer's
disease, Parkinson's_disease, and essential_tremor, autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases such as multiple_sclerosis and acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis,
genetic disorders such as Krabbe's_disease and Huntington's_disease, as well as
amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis and adrenoleukodystrophy. Lastly, cancers of the
central nervous system can cause severe illness and, when malignant, can have
very high mortality rates. Symptoms depend on the size, growth rate, location
and malignancy of tumors and can include alterations in motor control, hearing
loss, headaches and changes in cognitive ability and autonomic functioning.
Specialty professional organizations recommend that neurological imaging of the
brain be done only to answer a specific clinical question and not as routine
screening.[19]
