[edit_on_Wikidata]
The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal_tract plus the
accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary_glands, pancreas, liver,
and gallbladder). Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and
smaller components, until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body.
The process of digestion has three stages. The first stage is the cephalic
phase of digestion which begins with gastric secretions in response to the
sight and smell of food. This stage includes the mechanical breakdown of food
by chewing, and the chemical breakdown by digestive enzymes, that takes place
in the mouth.
Saliva contains digestive_enzymes called amylase, and lingual_lipase, secreted
by the salivary_glands and serous_glands on the tongue. The enzymes start to
break down the food in the mouth. Chewing, in which the food is mixed with
saliva, begins the mechanical process of digestion. This produces a bolus which
can be swallowed down the esophagus to enter the stomach. In the stomach the
gastric phase of digestion takes place. The food is further broken down by
mixing with gastric_acid until it passes into the duodenum, in the third
intestinal phase of digestion, where it is mixed with a number of enzymes
produced by the pancreas. Digestion is helped by the chewing of food carried
out by the muscles_of_mastication, the tongue, and the teeth, and also by the
contractions of peristalsis, and segmentation. Gastric_acid, and the production
of mucus in the stomach, are essential for the continuation of digestion.
Peristalsis is the rhythmic contraction of muscles that begins in the esophagus
and continues along the wall of the stomach and the rest of the
gastrointestinal_tract. This initially results in the production of chyme which
when fully broken down in the small_intestine is absorbed as chyle into the
lymphatic_system. Most of the digestion of food takes place in the small
intestine. Water and some minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the
colon of the large_intestine. The waste products of digestion (feces) are
defecated from the anus via the rectum.

***** Components *****
Historical depiction of the digestive system, 17th century Persia
There are several organs and other components involved in the digestion of
food. The organs known as the accessory digestive organs are the liver, gall
bladder and pancreas. Other components include the mouth, salivary_glands,
tongue, teeth and epiglottis.
The largest structure of the digestive system is the gastrointestinal_tract (GI
tract). This starts at the mouth and ends at the anus, covering a distance of
about nine (9) metres.[1]
The largest part of the GI tract is the colon or large_intestine. Water is
absorbed here and the remaining waste matter is stored prior to defecation.[2]
Most of the digestion of food takes place in the small_intestine which is the
longest part of the GI tract.
A major digestive organ is the stomach. Within its mucosa are millions of
embedded gastric_glands. Their secretions are vital to the functioning of the
organ.
There are many specialised cells of the GI tract. These include the various
cells of the gastric glands, taste_cells, pancreatic_duct_cells, enterocytes
and microfold_cells.
Some parts of the digestive system are also part of the excretory_system,
including the large intestine.[2]
**** Mouth ****
Oral cavity
The mouth is the first part of the upper_gastrointestinal_tract and is equipped
with several structures that begin the first processes of digestion.[3] These
include salivary glands, teeth and the tongue. The mouth consists of two
regions; the vestibule and the oral cavity proper. The vestibule is the area
between the teeth, lips and cheeks,[4] and the rest is the oral cavity proper.
Most of the oral cavity is lined with oral_mucosa, a mucous_membrane that
produces a lubricating mucus, of which only a small amount is needed. Mucous
membranes vary in structure in the different regions of the body but they all
produce a lubricating mucus, which is either secreted by surface cells or more
usually by underlying glands. The mucous membrane in the mouth continues as the
thin mucosa which lines the bases of the teeth. The main component of mucus is
a glycoprotein called mucin and the type secreted varies according to the
region involved. Mucin is viscous, clear, and clinging. Underlying the mucous
membrane in the mouth is a thin layer of smooth_muscle_tissue and the loose
connection to the membrane gives it its great elasticity.[5] It covers the
cheeks, inner surfaces of the lips, and floor of the mouth, and the mucin
produced is highly protective against tooth_decay.[6]
The roof of the mouth is termed the palate and it separates the oral cavity
from the nasal cavity. The palate is hard at the front of the mouth since the
overlying mucosa is covering a plate of bone; it is softer and more pliable at
the back being made of muscle and connective tissue, and it can move to swallow
food and liquids. The soft_palate ends at the uvula.[7] The surface of the hard
palate allows for the pressure needed in eating food, to leave the nasal
passage clear.[8] The opening between the lips is termed the oral fissure, and
the opening into the throat is called the fauces.[9]
At either side of the soft palate are the palatoglossus_muscles which also
reach into regions of the tongue. These muscles raise the back of the tongue
and also close both sides of the fauces to enable food to be swallowed.[10]:
1208 Mucus helps in the mastication of food in its ability to soften and
collect the food in the formation of the bolus.
*** Salivary glands ***
The main salivary glands
There are three pairs of main salivary_glands and between 800 and 1,000 minor
salivary glands, all of which mainly serve the digestive process, and also play
an important role in the maintenance of dental health and general mouth
lubrication, without which speech would be impossible.[11] The main glands are
all exocrine_glands, secreting via ducts. All of these glands terminate in the
mouth. The largest of these are the parotid_glandsâtheir secretion is mainly
serous. The next pair are underneath the jaw, the submandibular_glands, these
produce both serous_fluid and mucus. The serous fluid is produced by serous
glands in these salivary glands which also produce lingual_lipase. They produce
about 70% of the oral cavity saliva. The third pair are the sublingual_glands
located underneath the tongue and their secretion is mainly mucous with a small
percentage of saliva.
Within the oral_mucosa, and also on the tongue, palates, and floor of the
mouth, are the minor salivary glands; their secretions are mainly mucous and
they are innervated by the facial_nerve (CN7).[12] The glands also secrete
amylase a first stage in the breakdown of food acting on the carbohydrate in
the food to transform the starch content into maltose. There are other serous
glands on the surface of the tongue that encircle taste_buds on the back part
of the tongue and these also produce lingual lipase. Lipase is a digestive
enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of lipids (fats). These glands are termed
Von_Ebner's_glands which have also been shown to have another function in the
secretion of histatins which offer an early defense (outside of the immune
system) against microbes in food, when it makes contact with these glands on
the tongue tissue.[11][13] Sensory information can stimulate the secretion of
saliva providing the necessary fluid for the tongue to work with and also to
ease swallowing of the food.
** Saliva **
Main article: Saliva
Saliva moistens and softens food, and along with the chewing action of the
teeth, transforms the food into a smooth bolus. The bolus is further helped by
the lubrication provided by the saliva in its passage from the mouth into the
esophagus. Also of importance is the presence in saliva of the digestive
enzymes amylase and lipase. Amylase starts to work on the starch in
carbohydrates, breaking it down into the simple sugars of maltose and dextrose
that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Saliva in the mouth can
account for 30% of this initial starch digestion. Lipase starts to work on
breaking down fats. Lipase is further produced in the pancreas where it is
released to continue this digestion of fats. The presence of salivary lipase is
of prime importance in young babies whose pancreatic lipase has yet to be
developed.[14]
As well as its role in supplying digestive_enzymes, saliva has a cleansing
action for the teeth and mouth.[15] It also has an immunological role in
supplying antibodies to the system, such as immunoglobulin_A.[16] This is seen
to be key in preventing infections of the salivary glands, importantly that of
parotitis.
[Illu01_head_neck.jpg]
Saliva also contains a glycoprotein called haptocorrin which is a binding
protein to vitamin B12.[17] It binds with the vitamin in order to carry it
safely through the acidic content of the stomach. When it reaches the duodenum,
pancreatic enzymes break down the glycoprotein and free the vitamin which then
binds with intrinsic_factor.
*** Tongue ***
Food enters the mouth where the first stage in the digestive process takes
place, with the action of the tongue and the secretion of saliva. The tongue is
a fleshy and muscular sensory_organ, and the very first sensory information is
received via the taste buds in the papillae on its surface. If the taste is
agreeable, the tongue will go into action, manipulating the food in the mouth
which stimulates the secretion of saliva from the salivary glands. The liquid
quality of the saliva will help in the softening of the food and its enzyme
content will start to break down the food whilst it is still in the mouth. The
first part of the food to be broken down is the starch of carbohydrates (by the
enzyme amylase in the saliva).
The tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth by a ligamentous band called
the frenum[5] and this gives it great mobility for the manipulation of food
(and speech); the range of manipulation is optimally controlled by the action
of several muscles and limited in its external range by the stretch of the
frenum. The tongue's two sets of muscles, are four intrinsic_muscles that
originate in the tongue and are involved with its shaping, and four extrinsic
muscles originating in bone that are involved with its movement.
** Taste **
Main article: Taste
Cross section of circumvallate_papilla showing arrangement of nerves and taste
buds
Taste is a form of chemoreception that takes place in the specialised taste
receptors, contained in structures called taste_buds in the mouth. Taste buds
are mainly on the upper surface (dorsum) of the tongue. The function of taste
perception is vital to help prevent harmful or rotten foods from being
consumed. There are also taste buds on the epiglottis and upper part of the
esophagus. The taste buds are innervated by a branch of the facial nerve the
chorda_tympani, and the glossopharyngeal_nerve. Taste messages are sent via
these cranial_nerves to the brain. The brain can distinguish between the
chemical qualities of the food. The five basic_tastes are referred to as those
of saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami. The detection of
saltiness and sourness enables the control of salt and acid balance. The
detection of bitterness warns of poisonsâmany of a plant's defences are of
poisonous compounds that are bitter. Sweetness guides to those foods that will
supply energy; the initial breakdown of the energy-giving carbohydrates by
salivary amylase creates the taste of sweetness since simple sugars are the
first result. The taste of umami is thought to signal protein-rich food. Sour
tastes are acidic which is often found in bad food. The brain has to decide
very quickly whether the food should be eaten or not. It was the findings in
1991, describing the first olfactory receptors that helped to prompt the
research into taste. The olfactory receptors are located on cell surfaces in
the nose which bind to chemicals enabling the detection of smells. It is
assumed that signals from taste receptors work together with those from the
nose, to form an idea of complex food flavours.[18]
*** Teeth ***
Main article: Human_tooth
Teeth are complex structures made of materials specific to them. They are made
of a bone-like material called dentin, which is covered by the hardest tissue
in the bodyâenamel.[8] Teeth have different shapes to deal with different
aspects of mastication employed in tearing and chewing pieces of food into
smaller and smaller pieces. This results in a much larger surface area for the
action of digestive enzymes. The teeth are named after their particular roles
in the process of masticationâincisors are used for cutting or biting off
pieces of food; canines, are used for tearing, premolars and molars are used
for chewing and grinding. Mastication of the food with the help of saliva and
mucus results in the formation of a soft bolus which can then be swallowed to
make its way down the upper_gastrointestinal_tract to the stomach.[19] The
digestive enzymes in saliva also help in keeping the teeth clean by breaking
down any lodged food particles.[20][15]
*** Epiglottis ***
Main article: Epiglottis
[Gray958.png]
The epiglottis is a flap of elastic_cartilage attached to the entrance of the
larynx. It is covered with a mucous membrane and there are taste buds on its
lingual surface which faces into the mouth.[21] Its laryngeal surface faces
into the larynx. The epiglottis functions to guard the entrance of the glottis,
the opening between the vocal_folds. It is normally pointed upward during
breathing with its underside functioning as part of the pharynx, but during
swallowing, the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position, with its
upper side functioning as part of the pharynx. In this manner it prevents food
from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus, which is
behind. During swallowing, the backward motion of the tongue forces the
epiglottis over the glottis' opening to prevent any food that is being
swallowed from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs; the larynx is also
pulled upwards to assist this process. Stimulation of the larynx by ingested
matter produces a strong cough_reflex in order to protect the lungs.
**** Pharynx ****
Main article: Pharynx
The pharynx is a part of the conducting_zone of the respiratory_system and also
a part of the digestive system. It is the part of the throat immediately behind
the nasal_cavity at the back of the mouth and above the esophagus and larynx.
The pharynx is made up of three parts. The lower two partsâthe oropharynx and
the laryngopharynx are involved in the digestive system. The laryngopharynx
connects to the esophagus and it serves as a passageway for both air and food.
Air enters the larynx anteriorly but anything swallowed has priority and the
passage of air is temporarily blocked. The pharynx is innervated by the
pharyngeal_plexus_of_the_vagus_nerve.[10]:1465 Muscles_in_the_pharynx push the
food into the esophagus. The pharynx joins the esophagus at the oesophageal
inlet which is located behind the cricoid_cartilage.
**** Esophagus ****
Main article: Esophagus
The esophagus, commonly known as the foodpipe or gullet, consists of a muscular
tube through which food passes from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus
is continuous with the laryngopharynx. It passes through the posterior
mediastinum in the thorax and enters the stomach through a hole in the thoracic
diaphragmâthe esophageal_hiatus, at the level of the tenth thoracic_vertebra
(T10). Its length averages 25 cm, varying with an individual's height. It is
divided into cervical, thoracic and abdominal parts. The pharynx joins the
esophagus at the esophageal inlet which is behind the cricoid_cartilage.
At rest the esophagus is closed at both ends, by the upper_and_lower_esophageal
sphincters. The opening of the upper sphincter is triggered by the swallowing
reflex so that food is allowed through. The sphincter also serves to prevent
back flow from the esophagus into the pharynx. The esophagus has a mucous
membrane and the epithelium which has a protective function is continuously
replaced due to the volume of food that passes inside the esophagus. During
swallowing, food passes from the mouth through the pharynx into the esophagus.
The epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position to direct the food into
the esophagus, and away from the trachea.
Once in the esophagus, the bolus travels down to the stomach via rhythmic
contraction and relaxation of muscles known as peristalsis. The lower
esophageal sphincter is a muscular sphincter surrounding the lower part of the
esophagus. The gastroesophageal_junction between the esophagus and the stomach
is controlled by the lower esophageal sphincter, which remains constricted at
all times other than during swallowing and vomiting to prevent the contents of
the stomach from entering the esophagus. As the esophagus does not have the
same protection from acid as the stomach, any failure of this sphincter can
lead to heartburn.
Adult digestive system
**** Diaphragm ****
[View_of_Viscera_Page_82.jpg]
The diaphragm is an important part of the body's digestive system. The muscular
diaphragm separates the thoracic_cavity from the abdominal_cavity where most of
the digestive organs are located. The suspensory_muscle attaches the ascending
duodenum to the diaphragm. This muscle is thought to be of help in the
digestive system in that its attachment offers a wider angle to the
duodenojejunal_flexure for the easier passage of digesting material. The
diaphragm also attaches to, and anchors the liver at its bare_area. The
esophagus enters the abdomen through a hole_in_the_diaphragm at the level of
T10.
**** Stomach ****
Main article: Stomach
Areas of the stomach
The stomach is a major organ of the gastrointestinal tract and digestive
system. It is a consistently J-shaped organ joined to the esophagus at its
upper end and to the duodenum at its lower end. Gastric_acid (informally
gastric juice), produced in the stomach plays a vital role in the digestive
process, and mainly contains hydrochloric_acid and sodium_chloride. A peptide
hormone, gastrin, produced by G_cells in the gastric_glands, stimulates the
production of gastric juice which activates the digestive_enzymes. Pepsinogen
is a precursor enzyme (zymogen) produced by the gastric_chief_cells, and
gastric acid activates this to the enzyme pepsin which begins the digestion of
proteins. As these two chemicals would damage the stomach wall, mucus is
secreted by innumerable gastric glands in the stomach, to provide a slimy
protective layer against the damaging effects of the chemicals on the inner
layers of the stomach.
At the same time that protein is being digested, mechanical churning occurs
through the action of peristalsis, waves of muscular contractions that move
along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the
digestive_enzymes. Gastric_lipase secreted by the chief cells in the fundic
glands in the gastric_mucosa of the stomach, is an acidic lipase, in contrast
with the alkaline pancreatic lipase. This breaks down fats to some degree
though is not as efficient as the pancreatic lipase.
The pylorus, the lowest section of the stomach which attaches to the duodenum
via the pyloric_canal, contains countless glands which secrete digestive
enzymes including gastrin. After an hour or two, a thick semi-liquid called
chyme is produced. When the pyloric_sphincter, or valve opens, chyme enters the
duodenum where it mixes further with digestive enzymes from the pancreas, and
then passes through the small intestine, where digestion continues. When the
chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of
nutrients occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back
into the blood in the colon of the large intestine, where the environment is
slightly acidic. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin_K produced by
bacteria in the gut_flora of the colon are also absorbed.
The parietal_cells in the fundus of the stomach, produce a glycoprotein called
intrinsic_factor which is essential for the absorption of vitamin_B12. Vitamin
B12 (cobalamin), is carried to, and through the stomach, bound to a
glycoprotein secreted by the salivary glands - transcobalamin_I also called
haptocorrin, which protects the acid-sensitive vitamin from the acidic stomach
contents. Once in the more neutral duodenum, pancreatic enzymes break down the
protective glycoprotein. The freed vitamin B12 then binds to intrinsic factor
which is then absorbed by the enterocytes in the ileum.
The stomach is a distensible organ and can normally expand to hold about one
litre of food.[22] This expansion is enabled by a series of gastric_folds in
the inner walls of the stomach. The stomach of a newborn baby will only be able
to expand to retain about 30 ml.
**** Spleen ****
Main article: Spleen
The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ in the body but has other functions.
[23] It breaks down both red and white blood_cells that are spent. This is why
it is sometimes known as the 'graveyard of red blood cells'.[23] A product of
this digestion is the pigment bilirubin, which is sent to the liver and
secreted in the bile. Another product is iron, which is used in the formation
of new blood cells in the bone_marrow.[5] Medicine treats the spleen solely as
belonging to the lymphatic_system, though it is acknowledged that the full
range of its important functions is not yet understood.[10]:1751
**** Liver ****
Main article: Liver
[Liver_and_gall_bladder]
The liver is the second largest organ (after the skin) and is an accessory
digestive gland which plays a role in the body's metabolism. The liver has many
functions some of which are important to digestion. The liver can detoxify
various metabolites; synthesise proteins and produce biochemicals needed for
digestion. It regulates the storage of glycogen which it can form from glucose
(glycogenesis). The liver can also synthesise glucose from certain amino_acids.
Its digestive functions are largely involved with the breaking down of
carbohydrates. It also maintains protein metabolism in its synthesis and
degradation. In lipid metabolism it synthesises cholesterol. Fats are also
produced in the process of lipogenesis. The liver synthesises the bulk of
lipoproteins. The liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen
and below the diaphragm to which it is attached at one part, the bare_area_of
the_liver. This is to the right of the stomach and it overlies the gall
bladder. The liver synthesises bile_acids and lecithin to promote the digestion
of fat.[24]
*** Bile ***
Bile produced by the liver is made up of water (97%), bile_salts, mucus and
pigments, 1% fats and inorganic salts.[25] Bilirubin is its major pigment. Bile
acts partly as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension between either two
liquids or a solid and a liquid and helps to emulsify the fats in the chyme.
Food fat is dispersed by the action of bile into smaller units called micelles.
The breaking down into micelles creates a much larger surface area for the
pancreatic enzyme, lipase to work on. Lipase digests the triglycerides which
are broken down into two fatty_acids and a monoglyceride. These are then
absorbed by villi on the intestinal wall. If fats are not absorbed in this way
in the small intestine problems can arise later in the large intestine which is
not equipped to absorb fats. Bile also helps in the absorption of vitamin_K
from the diet. Bile is collected and delivered through the common_hepatic_duct.
This duct joins with the cystic_duct to connect in a common_bile_duct with the
gallbladder. Bile is stored in the gallbladder for release when food is
discharged into the duodenum and also after a few hours.[26]
*** Gallbladder ***
Gallbladder shown in green below the liver
The gallbladder is a hollow part of the biliary_tract that sits just beneath
the liver, with the gallbladder body resting in a small depression.[27] It is a
small organ where the bile produced by the liver is stored, before being
released into the small intestine. Bile flows from the liver through the bile
ducts and into the gall bladder for storage. The bile is released in response
to cholecystokinin (CCK) a peptide_hormone released from the duodenum. The
production of CCK (by endocrine cells of the duodenum) is stimulated by the
presence of fat in the duodenum.[28]
It is divided into three sections, a fundus, body and neck. The neck tapers and
connects to the biliary tract via the cystic_duct, which then joins the common
hepatic_duct to form the common_bile_duct. At this junction is a mucosal fold
called Hartmann's pouch, where gallstones commonly get stuck. The muscular
layer of the body is of smooth muscle tissue that helps the gallbladder
contract, so that it can discharge its bile into the bile duct. The gallbladder
needs to store bile in a natural, semi-liquid form at all times. Hydrogen_ions
secreted from the inner lining of the gallbladder keep the bile acidic enough
to prevent hardening. To dilute the bile, water and electrolytes from the
digestion system are added. Also, salts attach themselves to cholesterol
molecules in the bile to keep them from crystallising. If there is too much
cholesterol or bilirubin in the bile, or if the gallbladder doesn't empty
properly the systems can fail. This is how gallstones form when a small piece
of calcium gets coated with either cholesterol or bilirubin and the bile
crystallises and forms a gallstone. The main purpose of the gallbladder is to
store and release bile, or gall. Bile is released into the small intestine in
order to help in the digestion of fats by breaking down larger molecules into
smaller ones. After the fat is absorbed, the bile is also absorbed and
transported back to the liver for reuse.
**** Pancreas ****
Main article: Pancreas
Pancreas, duodenum and bile duct
Action of digestive hormones
The pancreas is a major organ functioning as an accessory digestive gland in
the digestive system. It is both an endocrine_gland and an exocrine_gland.[29]
The endocrine part secretes insulin when the blood_sugar becomes high; insulin
moves glucose from the blood into the muscles and other tissues for use as
energy. The endocrine part releases glucagon when the blood sugar is low;
glucagon allows stored sugar to be broken down into glucose by the liver in
order to re-balance the sugar levels. The pancreas produces and releases
important digestive enzymes in the pancreatic_juice that it delivers to the
duodenum.[24] The pancreas lies below and at the back of the stomach. It
connects to the duodenum via the pancreatic_duct which it joins near to the
bile duct's connection where both the bile and pancreatic juice can act on the
chyme that is released from the stomach into the duodenum. Aqueous pancreatic
secretions from pancreatic_duct_cells contain bicarbonate ions which are
alkaline and help with the bile to neutralise the acidic chyme that is churned
out by the stomach.
The pancreas is also the main source of enzymes for the digestion of fats and
proteins. Some of these are released in response to the production of CKK in
the duodenum. (The enzymes that digest polysaccharides, by contrast, are
primarily produced by the walls of the intestines.) The cells are filled with
secretory granules containing the precursor digestive enzymes. The major
proteases, the pancreatic enzymes which work on proteins, are trypsinogen and
chymotrypsinogen. Elastase is also produced. Smaller amounts of lipase and
amylase are secreted. The pancreas also secretes phospholipase_A2,
lysophospholipase, and cholesterol esterase. The precursor zymogens, are
inactive variants of the enzymes; which avoids the onset of pancreatitis caused
by autodegradation. Once released in the intestine, the enzyme enteropeptidase
present in the intestinal mucosa activates trypsinogen by cleaving it to form
trypsin; further cleavage results in chymotripsin.
**** Lower gastrointestinal tract ****
Main article: Gastrointestinal_tract
Further information: Gastrointestinal_physiology
The lower gastrointestinal tract (GI), includes the small_intestine and all of
the large_intestine.[30] The intestine is also called the bowel or the gut. The
lower GI starts at the pyloric sphincter of the stomach and finishes at the
anus. The small intestine is subdivided into the duodenum, the jejunum and the
ileum. The cecum marks the division between the small and large intestine. The
large intestine includes the rectum and anal_canal.[2]
*** Small intestine ***
Lower GI tract - 3) Small intestine; 5) Cecum; 6) Large intestine
Duodenum
Partially digested food starts to arrive in the small_intestine as semi-liquid
chyme, one hour after it is eaten. After two hours the stomach has emptied.
In the small intestine, the pH becomes crucial; it needs to be finely balanced
in order to activate digestive enzymes. The chyme is very acidic, with a low
pH, having been released from the stomach and needs to be made much more
alkaline. This is achieved in the duodenum by the addition of bile from the
gall bladder combined with the bicarbonate secretions from the pancreatic duct
and also from secretions of bicarbonate-rich mucus from duodenal glands known
as Brunner's_glands. The chyme arrives in the intestines having been released
from the stomach through the opening of the pyloric_sphincter. The resulting
alkaline fluid mix neutralises the gastric acid which would damage the lining
of the intestine. The mucus component lubricates the walls of the intestine.
When the digested food particles are reduced enough in size and composition,
they can be absorbed by the intestinal wall and carried to the bloodstream. The
first receptacle for this chyme is the duodenal_bulb. From here it passes into
the first of the three sections of the small intestine, the duodenum. (The next
section is the jejunum and the third is the ileum). The duodenum is the first
and shortest section of the small intestine. It is a hollow, jointed C-shaped
tube connecting the stomach to the jejunum. It starts at the duodenal bulb and
ends at the suspensory_muscle_of_duodenum. The attachment of the suspensory
muscle to the diaphragm is thought to help the passage of food by making a
wider angle at its attachment.
Most food digestion takes place in the small intestine. Segmentation
contractions act to mix and move the chyme more slowly in the small intestine
allowing more time for absorption (and these continue in the large intestine).
In the duodenum, pancreatic lipase is secreted together with a co-enzyme,
colipase to further digest the fat content of the chyme. From this breakdown,
smaller particles of emulsified fats called chylomicrons are produced. There
are also digestive cells called enterocytes lining the intestines (the majority
being in the small intestine). They are unusual cells in that they have villi
on their surface which in turn have innumerable microvilli on their surface.
All these villi make for a greater surface area, not only for the absorption of
chyme but also for its further digestion by large numbers of digestive enzymes
present on the microvilli.
The chylomicrons are small enough to pass through the enterocyte villi and into
their lymph capillaries called lacteals. A milky fluid called chyle, consisting
mainly of the emulsified fats of the chylomicrons, results from the absorbed
mix with the lymph in the lacteals.[clarification_needed] Chyle is then
transported through the lymphatic_system to the rest of the body.
The suspensory muscle marks the end of the duodenum and the division between
the upper gastrointestinal tract and the lower GI tract. The digestive tract
continues as the jejunum which continues as the ileum. The jejunum, the
midsection of the small intestine contains circular_folds, flaps of doubled
mucosal membrane which partially encircle and sometimes completely encircle the
lumen of the intestine. These folds together with villi serve to increase the
surface area of the jejunum enabling an increased absorption of digested
sugars, amino acids and fatty acids into the bloodstream. The circular folds
also slow the passage of food giving more time for nutrients to be absorbed.
The last part of the small intestine is the ileum. This also contains villi and
vitamin_B12; bile acids and any residue nutrients are absorbed here. When the
chyme is exhausted of its nutrients the remaining waste material changes into
the semi-solids called feces, which pass to the large intestine, where bacteria
in the gut_flora further break down residual proteins and starches.[31]
*** Cecum ***
Cecum and beginning of ascending colon
The cecum is a pouch marking the division between the small intestine and the
large intestine. It lies below the ileocecal_valve in the lower_right_quadrant
of the abdomen.[32]The cecum receives chyme from the last part of the small
intestine, the ileum, and connects to the ascending_colon of the large
intestine. At this junction there is a sphincter or valve, the ileocecal valve
which slows the passage of chyme from the ileum, allowing further digestion. It
is also the site of the appendix attachment.[32]
*** Large intestine ***
Further information: Excretory_system
In the large_intestine,[2] the passage of the digesting food in the colon is a
lot slower, taking from 12 to 50 hours until it is removed by defecation. The
colon mainly serves as a site for the fermentation of digestible matter by the
gut_flora. The time taken varies considerably between individuals. The
remaining semi-solid waste is termed feces and is removed by the coordinated
contractions of the intestinal walls, termed peristalsis, which propels the
excreta forward to reach the rectum and exit via defecation from the anus. The
wall has an outer layer of longitudinal muscles, the taeniae_coli, and an inner
layer of circular muscles. The circular muscle keeps the material moving
forward and also prevents any back flow of waste. Also of help in the action of
peristalsis is the basal_electrical_rhythm that determines the frequency of
contractions.[33] The taeniae coli can be seen and are responsible for the
bulges (haustra) present in the colon. Most parts of the GI tract are covered
with serous_membranes and have a mesentery. Other more muscular parts are lined
with adventitia.
***** Blood supply *****
Arteries and veins around the pancreas and spleen
The digestive system is supplied by the celiac_artery. The celiac artery is the
first major branch from the abdominal_aorta, and is the only major artery that
nourishes the digestive organs.
There are three main divisions â the left_gastric_artery, the common_hepatic
artery and the splenic_artery.
The celiac artery supplies the liver, stomach, spleen and the upper 1/3 of the
duodenum (to the sphincter_of_Oddi) and the pancreas with oxygenated blood.
Most of the blood is returned to the liver via the portal_venous_system for
further processing and detoxification before returning to the systemic
circulation via the hepatic_veins.
The next branch from the abdominal aorta is the superior_mesenteric_artery,
which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived from the midgut,
which includes the distal 2/3 of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix,
ascending colon, and the proximal 2/3 of the transverse colon.
The final branch which is important for the digestive system is the inferior
mesenteric_artery, which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived
from the hindgut, which includes the distal 1/3 of the transverse colon,
descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and the anus above the pectinate_line.
***** Nerve supply *****
Further information: Neurogastroenterology and Gut-brain_axis
Dietary life rules, Japan, Edo_period.
The enteric_nervous_system consists of some one hundred million neurons[34]
that are embedded in the peritoneum, the lining of the gastrointestinal_tract
extending from the esophagus to the anus.[35] These neurons are collected into
two plexuses - the myenteric_(or_Auerbach's)_plexus that lies between the
longitudinal and the smooth muscle layers, and the submucosal_(or_Meissner's)
plexus that lies between the circular smooth muscle layer and the mucosa.[36]
[37][38]
Parasympathetic_innervation to the ascending_colon is supplied by the vagus
nerve. Sympathetic_innervation is supplied by the splanchnic_nerves that join
the celiac_ganglia. Most of the digestive tract is innervated by the two large
celiac ganglia, with the upper part of each ganglion joined by the greater
splanchnic_nerve and the lower parts joined by the lesser_splanchnic_nerve. It
is from these ganglia that many of the gastric_plexuses arise.
***** Development *****
Main article: Development_of_the_digestive_system
Early in embryonic_development, the embryo has three germ_layers and abuts a
yolk_sac. During the second week of development, the embryo grows and begins to
surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the
basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to
differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the
esophagus, stomach, and intestines.[39]
During the fourth week of development, the stomach rotates. The stomach,
originally lying in the midline of the embryo, rotates so that its body is on
the left. This rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal tube
immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the duodenum. By the
end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins to spout a small
outpouching on its right side, the hepatic_diverticulum, which will go on to
become the biliary_tree. Just below this is a second outpouching, known as the
cystic diverticulum, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.[39]
***** Clinical significance *****
Main article: Gastrointestinal_disease
Each part of the digestive system is subject to a wide range of disorders many
of which can be congenital. Mouth_diseases can also be caused by pathogenic
bacteria, viruses, fungi and as a side effect of some medications. Mouth
diseases include tongue_diseases and salivary_gland_diseases. A common gum
disease in the mouth is gingivitis which is caused by bacteria in plaque. The
most common viral infection of the mouth is gingivostomatitis caused by herpes
simplex. A common fungal infection is candidiasis commonly known as thrush
which affects the mucous_membranes of the mouth.
There are a number of esophageal_diseases such as the development of Schatzki
rings that can restrict the passageway, causing difficulties in swallowing.
They can also completely block the esophagus.[40]
Stomach_diseases are often chronic conditions and include gastroparesis,
gastritis, and peptic_ulcers.
A number of problems including malnutrition and anemia can arise from
malabsorption, the abnormal absorption of nutrients in the GI tract.
Malabsorption can have many causes ranging from infection, to enzyme
deficiencies such as exocrine_pancreatic_insufficiency. It can also arise as a
result of other gastrointestinal diseases such as coeliac_disease. Coeliac
disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine. This can cause
vitamin_deficiencies due to the improper absorption of nutrients in the small
intestine. The small intestine can also be obstructed by a volvulus, a loop of
intestine that becomes twisted enclosing its attached mesentery. This can cause
mesenteric_ischemia if severe enough.
A common disorder of the bowel is diverticulitis. Diverticula are small pouches
that can form inside the bowel wall, which can become inflamed to give
diverticulitis. This disease can have complications if an inflamed diverticulum
bursts and infection sets in. Any infection can spread further to the lining of
the abdomen (peritoneum) and cause potentially fatal peritonitis.[41]
Crohn's_disease is a common chronic inflammatory_bowel_disease (IBD), which can
affect any part of the GI tract,[42] but it mostly starts in the terminal
ileum.
Ulcerative_colitis an ulcerative form of colitis, is the other major
inflammatory bowel disease which is restricted to the colon and rectum. Both of
these IBDs can give an increased risk of the development of colorectal_cancer.
Ulcerative coliltis is the most common of the IBDs[43]
Irritable_bowel_syndrome (IBS) is the most common of the functional
gastrointestinal_disorders. These are idiopathic disorders that the Rome
process has helped to define.[44]
Giardiasis is a disease of the small intestine caused by a protist parasite
Giardia_lamblia. This does not spread but remains confined to the lumen of the
small intestine.[45] It can often be asymptomatic, but as often can be
indicated by a variety of symptoms. Giardiasis is the most common pathogenic
parasitic_infection in humans.[46]
There are diagnostic tools mostly involving the ingestion of barium_sulphate to
investigate disorders of the GI tract.[47] These are known as upper
gastrointestinal_series that enable imaging of the pharynx, larynx,
oesophagous, stomach and small intestine[48] and lower_gastrointestinal_series
for imaging of the colon.
**** In pregnancy ****
Gestation can predispose for certain digestive disorders. Gestational_diabetes
can develop in the mother as a result of pregnancy and while this often
presents with few symptoms it can lead to pre-eclampsia.[49]
