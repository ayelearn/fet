Comparative physiology is a subdiscipline of physiology that studies and
exploits the diversity of functional characteristics of various kinds of
organisms. It is closely related to evolutionary_physiology and environmental
physiology. Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover
comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to Clifford_Ladd_Prosser,
"Comparative Physiology is not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a
philosophy."[1]

***** History[edit] *****
Originally, physiology focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a
desire to improve medical practices. When physiologists first began comparing
different species it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how
organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological
principles. This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific
questions is known as the Krogh_Principle.
***** Methodology[edit] *****
C. Ladd Prosser,[2] a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a
broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary
and discussion in Garland and Carter[3]):
1. To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.
      This amounts to cataloging functional aspects of biological diversity,
      and has recently been criticized as "stamp collecting" with the
      suggestion that the field should move beyond that initial, exploratory
      phase.[4]
2. The use of physiological information to reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships of organisms.
      In principle physiological information could be used just as
      morphological information or DNA sequence is used to measure evolutionary
      divergence of organisms. In practice, this has rarely been done, for at
      least four reasons:
          * physiology doesn't leave many fossil cues,
          * it can't be measured on museum specimens,
          * it is difficult to quantify as compared with morphology or DNA
            sequences, and
          * physiology is more likely to be adaptive than DNA, and so subject
            to parallel and convergent_evolution, which confuses phylogenetic
            reconstruction.
3. To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and
their environments.
      This is essentially physiological_ecology or ecological physiology.
4. To identify "model systems" for studying particular physiological functions.
      Examples of this include using squid giant axons to understand general
      principles of nerve transmission, using rattlesnake tail shaker muscles
      for measurement of in vivo changes in metabolites (because the whole
      animal can be put in an NMR machine),[5] and the use of ectothermic
      poikilotherms to study effects of temperature on physiology.
5. To use the "kind of animal" as an experimental variable.
      "While other branches of physiology use such variables as light,
      temperature, oxygen tension, and hormone balance, comparative physiology
      uses, in addition, species or animal type as a variable for each
      function." [6]
      25 years later, Prosser put things this way: "I like to think of it as
      that method in physiology which uses kind of organism as one experimental
      variable."[1]
Comparative physiologists often study organisms that live in "extreme"
environments (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear
examples of evolutionary adaptation.[3] One example is the study of water
balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney
specializations.[7]
Similarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to "unusual"
organisms, such as very large or small ones. As an example, of the latter,
hummingbirds have been studied. As another example, giraffe have been studied
because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to
specializations related to the regulation of blood_pressure. More generally,
ectothermic vertebrates have been studied to determine how blood acid-base
balance and pH change as body_temperature changes.
***** Funding[edit] *****
In the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the
National_Institutes_of_Health and the National_Science_Foundation.
***** Societies[edit] *****
A number of scientific societies feature sections on comparative physiology,
including:
    * American_Physiological_Society
    * Australian_&_New_Zealand_Society_for_Comparative_Physiology_&
      Biochemistry
    * Canadian_Society_of_Zoologists
    * Japanese_Society_for_Comparative_Physiology_and_Biochemistry
    * Society_for_Integrative_and_Comparative_Biology
    * Society_for_Experimental_Biology
***** Biographies[edit] *****
Knut_Schmidt-Nielsen (1915â2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative
physiology, serving on the faculty at Duke_University for many years and
training a large number of students (obituary). He also authored several books,
including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style.
Grover_C._Stephens (1925â2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative
physiologist, serving on the faculty of the University_of_Minnesota until
becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the
University_of_California_at_Irvine in 1964. He was the mentor for numerous
graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field
(obituary). He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished
biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.
