Zoology (/zoÊËÉlÉdÊi,_zu-/)[note_1] is the branch of biology that studies
the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution,
classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and
extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from
Ancient_Greek Î¶á¿·Î¿Î½, zÅion, i.e. "animal" and Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï, logos, i.e.
"knowledge, study".[1]

***** History[edit] *****
**** Ancient History to Darwin[edit] ****
Conrad_Gesner (1516â1565). His Historiae_animalium is considered the
beginning of modern zoology.
Main article: History_of_zoology_(through_1859)
The history of zoology traces the study of the animal_kingdom from ancient to
modern times. Although the concept of zoology as a single coherent field arose
much later, the zoological sciences emerged from natural_history reaching back
to the biological_works_of_Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman
world. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle_Ages by Muslim
physicians and scholars such as Albertus_Magnus.[2][3][4] During the
Renaissance and early modern period, zoological thought was revolutionized in
Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel
organisms. Prominent in this movement were Vesalius and William_Harvey, who
used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists
such as Carl_Linnaeus, Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck, and Buffon who began to classify
the_diversity_of_life and the fossil_record, as well as the development and
behavior of organisms. Microscopy revealed the previously unknown world of
microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell_theory.[5] The growing
importance of natural_theology, partly a response to the rise of mechanical
philosophy, encouraged the growth of natural_history (although it entrenched
the argument_from_design).
Over the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, zoology became an increasingly
professional scientific_discipline. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander_von
Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment,
and the ways this relationship depends on geography, laying the foundations for
biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism
and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability_of_species. Cell
theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life.[6][7]
**** Post-Darwin[edit] ****
Main article: History_of_zoology_(since_1859)
These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology,
were synthesized in Charles_Darwin's theory of evolution by natural_selection.
In 1859, Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by his
discovery of a process by which organic evolution can occur, and provided
observational evidence that it had done so.[8]
Darwin gave a new direction to morphology and physiology, by uniting them in a
common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a
reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a genealogical basis,
fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to
determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall
of spontaneous_generation and the rise of the germ_theory_of_disease, though
the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the
rediscovery of Mendel's work led to the rapid development of genetics, and by
the 1930s the combination of population_genetics and natural selection in the
modern_synthesis created evolutionary_biology.[9]
***** Research[edit] *****
**** Structural[edit] ****
Cell_biology studies the structural and physiological properties of cells,
including their behavior, interactions, and environment. This is done on both
the microscopic and molecular levels, for single-celled organisms such as
bacteria as well as the specialized cells in multicellular_organisms such as
humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all
of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types
are particularly relevant to molecular biology.
Anatomy considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as organs and organ
systems.[10] It focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the
bodies of humans and animals, in addition to how they work independently.
Anatomy and cell biology are two studies that are closely related, and can be
categorized under "structural" studies.
**** Physiological[edit] ****

Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of
living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function
as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology.
Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant_physiology and
animal_physiology, but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter
what particular organism is being studied. For example, what is learned about
the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells. The field of
animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human_physiology to non-
human species. Physiology studies how for example nervous, immune, endocrine,
respiratory, and circulatory systems, function and interact.
**** Evolutionary[edit] ****
Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of species, as
well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically
oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have
special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy, ornithology,
herpetology, or entomology, but use those organisms as systems to answer
general questions about evolution.
Evolutionary biology is partly based on paleontology, which uses the fossil
record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,[11] and
partly on the developments in areas such as population_genetics[12] and
evolutionary theory. Following the development of DNA_fingerprinting techniques
in the late 20th century, the application of these techniques in zoology has
increased the understanding of animal populations.[13] In the 1980s,
developmental_biology re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial
exclusion from the modern_synthesis through the study of evolutionary
developmental_biology.[14] Related fields often considered part of evolutionary
biology are phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy.
**** Classification[edit] ****
Scientific_classification_in_zoology, is a method by which zoologists group and
categorize organisms by biological_type, such as genus or species. Biological
classification is a form of scientific_taxonomy. Modern biological
classification has its root in the work of Carl_Linnaeus, who grouped species
according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been
revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common_descent.
Molecular_phylogenetics, which uses DNA_sequences as data, has driven many
recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification
belongs to the science of zoological_systematics.
Linnaeus's table of the animal kingdom from the first edition of Systema
Naturae (1735).
Many scientists now consider the five-kingdom_system outdated. Modern
alternative classification systems generally start with the three-domain
system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria);
Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals)[15] These domains
reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the
chemical composition of the cell exteriors.[15]
Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is
separately classified. The order is: Domain; kingdom; phylum; class; order;
family; genus; species. The scientific name of an organism is generated from
its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo_sapiens. Homo is
the genus, and sapiens the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the
species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to
capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in
lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.[16]
The dominant classification system is called the Linnaean_taxonomy. It includes
ranks and binomial_nomenclature. The classification, taxonomy, and nomenclature
of zoological organisms is administered by the International_Code_of_Zoological
Nomenclature. A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to
standardize nomenclature, but has yet to be formally adopted.[17]
**** Ethology[edit] ****

regurgitating reflex.
Ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behavior under natural
conditions,[18] as opposed to behaviourism, which focuses on behavioral
response studies in a laboratory setting. Ethologists have been particularly
concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in
terms of the theory of natural_selection. In one sense, the first modern
ethologist was Charles_Darwin, whose book, The_Expression_of_the_Emotions_in
Man_and_Animals, influenced many future ethologists.[19]
**** Biogeography[edit] ****
Biogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the Earth,[20]
focusing on topics like plate_tectonics, climate_change, dispersal and
migration, and cladistics. The creation of this study is widely accredited to
Alfred_Russel_Wallace, a British biologist who had some of his work jointly
published with Charles_Darwin.
***** Branches of zoology[edit] *****
Although the study of animal life is ancient, its scientific incarnation is
relatively modern. This mirrors the transition from natural_history to biology
at the start of the 19th century. Since Hunter and Cuvier, comparative
anatomical study has been associated with morphography, shaping the modern
areas of zoological investigation: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology,
teratology and ethology.[21] Modern zoology first arose in German and British
universities. In Britain, Thomas_Henry_Huxley was a prominent figure. His ideas
were centered on the morphology of animals. Many consider him the greatest
comparative anatomist of the latter half of the 19th century. Similar to
Hunter, his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes
in contrast to the previous format of lectures only.
Gradually zoology expanded beyond Huxley's comparative_anatomy to include the
following sub-disciplines:
    * Zoography, also known as descriptive zoology, is the applied science of
      describing animals and their habitats
    * Comparative_anatomy studies the structure of animals
    * Animal_physiology
    * Behavioral_ecology
    * Ethology studies animal behavior
    * Invertebrate_zoology
    * Vertebrate_zoology
    * Soil_zoology
    * The various taxonomically oriented disciplines such as mammalogy,
      biological_anthropology, herpetology, ornithology, ichthyology, and
      entomology identify and classify species and study the structures and
      mechanisms specific to those groups.
Related fields:
    * Evolutionary_biology: Development of both animals and plants is
      considered in the articles on evolution, population_genetics, heredity,
      variation, Mendelism, and reproduction.
    * Molecular_biology studies the common genetic and developmental mechanisms
      of animals and plants
    * Palaeontology: Study of fossils of the life forms that are now extinct.
    * Systematics, cladistics, phylogenetics, phylogeography, biogeography, and
      taxonomy classify and group species via common descent and regional
      associations.
