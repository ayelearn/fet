Simulation of thermal convection in the Earth's_mantle. Colors span from red
and green to blue with decreasing temperatures. A hot, less-dense lower
boundary layer sends plumes of hot material upwards, and cold material from the
top moves downwards.
Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal_engineering that concerns the
generation, use, conversion, and exchange of thermal_energy (heat) between
physical systems. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as
thermal_conduction, thermal_convection, thermal_radiation, and transfer of
energy by phase_changes. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of
differing chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. While
these mechanisms have distinct characteristics, they often occur simultaneously
in the same system.
Heat conduction, also called diffusion, is the direct microscopic exchange of
kinetic energy of particles through the boundary between two systems. When an
object is at a different temperature from another body or its surroundings,
heat flows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature, at
which point they are in thermal_equilibrium. Such spontaneous heat transfer
always occurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower
temperature, as described in the second_law_of_thermodynamics.
Heat convection occurs when bulk flow of a fluid (gas or liquid) carries heat
along with the flow of matter in the fluid. The flow of fluid may be forced by
external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces
caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume),
thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called "natural
convection". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as
well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid
is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan or other mechanical means.
Thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium (solid or
fluid or gas). It is the transfer of energy by means of photons in
electromagnetic_waves governed by the same laws.[1]

***** Overview[edit] *****
See also: Heat_transfer_physics
Earth's long wave thermal radiation intensity, from clouds, atmosphere and
surface.
Heat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal_energy across a well-
defined boundary around a thermodynamic_system. The thermodynamic_free_energy
is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform. Enthalpy is a
thermodynamic_potential, designated by the letter "H", that is the sum of the
internal_energy of the system (U) plus the product of pressure (P) and volume
(V). Joule is a unit to quantify energy, work, or the amount of heat.
Heat transfer is a process_function (or path function), as opposed to functions
of_state; therefore, the amount of heat transferred in a thermodynamic_process
that changes the state of a system depends on how that process occurs, not only
the net difference between the initial and final states of the process.
Thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat_transfer
coefficient, the proportionality between the heat_flux and the thermodynamic
driving force for the flow of heat. Heat flux is a quantitative, vectorial
representation of heat-flow through a surface.[2]
In engineering contexts, the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal
energy. This usage has its origin in the historical_interpretation of heat as a
fluid (caloric) that can be transferred by various causes,[3] and that is also
common in the language of laymen and everyday life.
The transport equations for thermal energy (Fourier's_law), mechanical momentum
(Newton's_law_for_fluids), and mass transfer (Fick's_laws_of_diffusion) are
similar,[4][5] and analogies among these three transport processes have been
developed to facilitate prediction of conversion from any one to the others.[5]
Thermal_engineering concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of
heat transfer. As such, heat transfer is involved in almost every sector of the
economy.[6] Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as
thermal_conduction, thermal_convection, thermal_radiation, and transfer of
energy by phase_changes.
***** Mechanisms[edit] *****
The fundamental modes of heat transfer are:
  Advection
      Advection is the transport mechanism of a fluid from one location to
      another, and is dependent on motion and momentum of that fluid.
  Conduction or diffusion
      The transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact.
      Thermal_conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat and
      evaluated primarily in terms of Fourier's_Law for heat conduction.
  Convection
      The transfer of energy between an object and its environment, due to
      fluid motion. The average temperature is a reference for evaluating
      properties related to convective heat transfer.
  Radiation
      The transfer of energy by the emission of electromagnetic_radiation.
**** Advection[edit] ****
By transferring matter, energyâincluding thermal energyâis moved by the
physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another.[7] This
can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed, or the
movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents. A practical example is
thermal_hydraulics.[citation_needed] This can be described by the formula:
          &#x03D5;  q   = v &#x03C1;  c  p   &#x0394; T   {\displaystyle \phi _
      {q}=v\rho c_{p}\Delta T}  [{\displaystyle \phi _{q}=v\rho c_{p}\Delta T}]
where
    *     &#x03D5;  q     {\displaystyle \phi _{q}}  [{\displaystyle \phi _
      {q}}] is heat_flux (W/mÂ²),
    *    &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is density (kg/mÂ³),
    *     c  p     {\displaystyle c_{p}}  [c_{p}] is heat capacity at constant
      pressure (J/kgÂ·K),
    *    &#x0394; T   {\displaystyle \Delta T}  [\Delta T] is the change in
      temperature (K),
    *    v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] is velocity (m/s).
**** Conduction[edit] ****
Main article: Thermal_conduction
On a microscopic scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or
vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules,
transferring some of their energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In
other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate
against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction
is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid
objects in thermal_contact. Fluidsâespecially gasesâare less conductive.
Thermal_contact_conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid
bodies in contact.[8] The process of heat transfer from one place to another
place without the movement of particles is called conduction, such as when
placing a hand on a cold glass of water - heat is conducted from the warm skin
to the cold glass, but if the hand is held a few inches from the glass, little
conduction would occur since air is a poor conductor of heat. Steady state
conduction is an idealized model of conduction that happens when the
temperature difference driving the conduction is constant, so that after a
time, the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does
not change any further (see Fourier's_law).[9] In steady state conduction, the
amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out, since
the change in temperature (a measure of heat energy) is zero.[8] An example of
steady state conduction is the heat flow through walls of a warm house on a
cold night - inside the house is maintained at a high temperature, and outside
the temperature stays low, so the transfer of heat per unit time stays near a
constant rate determined by the insulation in the wall, and the spatial
distribution of temperature in the walls will be approximately constant over
time.
Transient conduction (see Heat_equation) occurs when the temperature within an
object changes as a function of time. Analysis of transient systems is more
complex, and analytic solutions of the heat equation are only valid for
idealized model systems. Practical applications are generally investigated
using numerical methods, approximation techniques, or empirical study.[8]
**** Convection[edit] ****
Main article: Convection
The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in
gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the
fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The
latter process is often called "natural convection". All convective processes
also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is
forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by using a pump,
fan or other mechanical means.it is the process in which heat transfer through
the fluid as air

Convective_heat_transfer, or convection, is the transfer of heat from one place
to another by the movement of fluids, a process that is essentially the
transfer of heat via mass_transfer. Bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer
in many physical situations, such as (for example) between a solid surface and
the fluid.[10] Convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in
liquids and gases. Although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat
transfer, convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat
conduction within the fluid (diffusion) and heat transference by bulk fluid
flow streaming.[11] The process of transport by fluid streaming is known as
advection, but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with
mass transport in fluids, such as advection of pebbles in a river. In the case
of heat transfer in fluids, where transport by advection in a fluid is always
also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion (also known as heat
conduction) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of
heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction.
Free, or natural, convection occurs when bulk fluid motions (streams and
currents) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due
to variations of temperature in the fluid. Forced convection is a term used
when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external meansâsuch
as fans, stirrers, and pumpsâcreating an artificially induced convection
current.[12]
*** Convection-cooling[edit] ***
See also: Nusselt_number
Convective cooling is sometimes described as Newton's_law_of_cooling:
     The rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the temperature
     difference between the body and its surroundings.
However, by definition, the validity of Newton's law of Cooling requires that
the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of ("proportional
to") the temperature difference that drives heat transfer, and in convective
cooling this is sometimes not the case. In general, convection is not linearly
dependent on temperature gradients, and in some cases is strongly nonlinear. In
these cases, Newton's law does not apply.
**** Convection vs. conduction[edit] ****
In a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container, conduction and
convection can be considered to compete for dominance. If heat conduction is
too great, fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that
its downward movement will be stopped due to its buoyancy, while fluid moving
up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will
diminish. On the other hand, if heat conduction is very low, a large
temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong.
The Rayleigh_number (      R a     {\displaystyle {\rm {Ra}}}  [{\displaystyle
{\rm {Ra}}}]) is the product of the Grashof (      G r     {\displaystyle {\rm
{Gr}}}  [{\displaystyle {\rm {Gr}}}]) and Prandtl (      P r     {\displaystyle
{\rm {Pr}}}  [{\displaystyle {\rm {Pr}}}]) numbers. It is a measure which
determines the relative strength of conduction and convection.[13]
          R a  =  G r  &#x22C5;  P r  =    g &#x0394; &#x03C1;  L  3
      &#x03BC; &#x03B1;    =    g &#x03B2; &#x0394; T  L  3     &#x03BD;
      &#x03B1;      {\displaystyle \mathrm {Ra} =\mathrm {Gr} \cdot \mathrm
      {Pr} ={\frac {g\Delta \rho L^{3}}{\mu \alpha }}={\frac {g\beta \Delta TL^
      {3}}{\nu \alpha }}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {Ra} =\mathrm {Gr} \cdot
      \mathrm {Pr} ={\frac {g\Delta \rho L^{3}}{\mu \alpha }}={\frac {g\beta
      \Delta TL^{3}}{\nu \alpha }}}]
where
    * g is acceleration due to gravity,
    * Ï is the density with     &#x0394; &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \Delta \rho
      }  [\Delta \rho] being the density difference between the lower and upper
      ends,
    * Î¼ is the dynamic_viscosity,
    * Î± is the Thermal_diffusivity,
    * Î² is the volume thermal_expansivity (sometimes denoted Î± elsewhere),
    * T is the temperature,
    * Î½ is the kinematic_viscosity, and
    * L is characteristic length.
The Rayleigh number can be understood as the ratio between the rate of heat
transfer by convection to the rate of heat transfer by conduction; or,
equivalently, the ratio between the corresponding timescales (i.e. conduction
timescale divided by convection timescale), up to a numerical factor. This can
be seen as follows, where all calculations are up to numerical factors
depending on the geometry of the system.
The buoyancy force driving the convection is roughly     g &#x0394; &#x03C1;  L
3     {\displaystyle g\Delta \rho L^{3}}  [g \Delta \rho L^3], so the
corresponding pressure is roughly     g &#x0394; &#x03C1; L   {\displaystyle
g\Delta \rho L}  [g \Delta \rho L ]. In steady_state, this is canceled by the
shear stress due to viscosity, and therefore roughly equals     &#x03BC; V  /
L = &#x03BC;  /   T   c o n v      {\displaystyle \mu V/L=\mu /T_{\rm {conv}}}
[{\displaystyle \mu V/L=\mu /T_{\rm {conv}}}], where V is the typical fluid
velocity due to convection and      T   c o n v      {\displaystyle T_{\rm
{conv}}}  [{\displaystyle T_{\rm {conv}}}] the order of its timescale.[citation
needed] The conduction timescale, on the other hand, is of the order of      T
c o n d    =  L  2    /  &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle T_{\rm {cond}}=L^{2}/\alpha
}  [{\displaystyle T_{\rm {cond}}=L^{2}/\alpha }].
Convection occurs when the Rayleigh number is above 1,000â2,000.
**** Radiation[edit] ****
Red-hot iron object, transferring heat to the surrounding environment through
thermal radiation
Thermal_radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium (solid or
fluid or gas). It is the transfer of energy by means of photons in
electromagnetic_waves governed by the same laws.[1]
Thermal_radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves, due to
the pool of thermal_energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute
zero. Thermal radiation propagates without the presence of matter through the
vacuum of space.[14]
Thermal radiation is a direct result of the random movements of atoms and
molecules in matter. Since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged
particles (protons and electrons), their movement results in the emission of
electromagnetic_radiation, which carries energy away from the surface.
The Stefan-Boltzmann_equation, which describes the rate of transfer of radiant
energy, is as follows for an object in a vacuum :
          &#x03D5;  q   = &#x03F5; &#x03C3;  T  4   .   {\displaystyle \phi _
      {q}=\epsilon \sigma T^{4}.}  [{\displaystyle \phi _{q}=\epsilon \sigma T^
      {4}.}]
For radiative transfer between two objects, the equation is as follows:
          &#x03D5;  q   = &#x03F5; &#x03C3; F (  T  a   4   &#x2212;  T  b   4
      ) ,   {\displaystyle \phi _{q}=\epsilon \sigma F(T_{a}^{4}-T_{b}^{4}),}
      [{\displaystyle \phi _{q}=\epsilon \sigma F(T_{a}^{4}-T_{b}^{4}),}]
where
    *     &#x03D5;  q     {\displaystyle \phi _{q}}  [{\displaystyle \phi _
      {q}}] is the heat_flux,
    *    &#x03F5;   {\displaystyle \epsilon }  [\epsilon ] is the emissivity
      (unity for a black_body),
    *    &#x03C3;   {\displaystyle \sigma }  [\sigma ] is the
      StefanâBoltzmann_constant,
    *    F   {\displaystyle F}  [F] is the configuration_factor between two
      surfaces a and b, [15] and
    *     T  a     {\displaystyle T_{a}}  [{\displaystyle T_{a}}] and      T  b
      {\displaystyle T_{b}}  [{\displaystyle T_{b}}] are the absolute
      temperatures (in kelvins or degrees_Rankine) for the two objects.
Radiation is typically only important for very hot objects, or for objects with
a large temperature difference.
Radiation from the sun, or solar radiation, can be harvested for heat and
power.[16] Unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer, thermal
radiation â arriving within a narrow angle i.e. coming from a source much
smaller than its distance â can be concentrated in a small spot by using
reflecting mirrors, which is exploited in concentrating_solar_power generation
or a burning_glass.[17] For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats
the PS10_solar_power_tower and during the day it can heat water to 285 Â°C
(545 Â°F).[citation_needed]
The reachable temperature at the target is limited by the temperature of the
hot source of radiation. (T4-law lets the reverse-flow of radiation back to the
source rise.) The (on its surface) somewhat 4000 K hot sun allows to reach
coarsly 3000 K (or 3000 Â°C, which is about 3273 K) at a small probe in the
focus spot of a big concave, concentrating mirror of the Mont-Louis_Solar
Furnace in France.[18]
***** Phase transition[edit] *****
Lightning is a highly visible form of energy transfer and is an example of
plasma present at Earth's surface. Typically, lightning discharges 30,000
amperes at up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, X-rays and
even gamma rays.[19] Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000
kelvins (27,726.85 Â°C) (49,940.33 Â°F) and electron densities may exceed 1024
mâ3.
Phase_transition or phase change, takes place in a thermodynamic_system from
one phase or state_of_matter to another one by heat transfer. Phase change
examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water. The Mason_equation
explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport
on evaporation and condensation.
Phase transitions involve the four_fundamental_states_of_matter:
    * Solid â Deposition, freezing and solid to solid transformation.
    * Gas â Boilingâ/âevaporation, recombinationâ/âdeionization, and
      sublimation.
    * Liquid â Condensation and meltingâ/âfusion.
    * Plasma â Ionization.
**** Boiling[edit] ****
Nucleate boiling of water.
The boiling_point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure
of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid[20][21] and the liquid
evaporates resulting in an abrupt change in vapor volume.
Saturation temperature means boiling point. The saturation temperature is the
temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils
into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal
energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.
At standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures, no boiling occurs and
the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms. As
the surface temperature is increased, local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles
nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is sub-
cooled nucleate boiling, and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At
high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux
no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the departure
from_nucleate_boiling, or DNB).
At similar standard atmospheric pressure and high temperatures, the
hydrodynamically-quieter regime of film_boiling is reached. Heat fluxes across
the stable vapor layers are low, but rise slowly with temperature. Any contact
between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely
rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer ("spontaneous nucleation"). At higher
temperatures still, a maximum in the heat flux is reached (the critical_heat
flux, or CHF).
The Leidenfrost_Effect demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer
due to gas bubbles on the heater's surface. As mentioned, gas-phase thermal
conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity, so the
outcome is a kind of "gas thermal barrier".
**** Condensation[edit] ****
Condensation occurs when a vapor is cooled and changes its phase to a liquid.
During condensation, the latent_heat_of_vaporization must be released. The
amount of the heat is the same as that absorbed during vaporization at the same
fluid pressure.[22]
There are several types of condensation:
    * Homogeneous condensation, as during a formation of fog.
    * Condensation in direct contact with subcooled liquid.
    * Condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger:
      This is the most common mode used in industry:
          o Filmwise condensation is when a liquid film is formed on the
            subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid wets the
            surface.
          o Dropwise condensation is when liquid drops are formed on the
            subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid does not wet
            the surface.
      Dropwise condensation is difficult to sustain reliably; therefore,
      industrial equipment is normally designed to operate in filmwise
      condensation mode.
**** Melting[edit] ****
Ice melting
Melting is a thermal process that results in the phase transition of a
substance from a solid to a liquid. The internal_energy of a substance is
increased, typically with heat or pressure, resulting in a rise of its
temperature to the melting_point, at which the ordering of ionic or molecular
entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid
liquefies. Molten substances generally have reduced viscosity with elevated
temperature; an exception to this maxim is the element sulfur, whose viscosity
increases to a point due to polymerization and then decreases with higher
temperatures in its molten state.[23]
***** Modeling approaches[edit] *****
Heat transfer can be modeled in various ways.
**** Heat equation[edit] ****
The heat_equation is an important partial_differential_equation that describes
the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over
time. In some cases, exact solutions of the equation are available;[24] in
other cases the equation must be solved numerically using computational
methods.
**** Lumped system analysis[edit] ****
Lumped system analysis often reduces the complexity of the equations to one
first-order linear differential equation, in which case heating and cooling are
described by a simple exponential solution, often referred to as Newton's_law
of_cooling.
System analysis by the lumped_capacitance_model is a common approximation in
transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object
is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object. This is
a method of approximation that reduces one aspect of the transient conduction
systemâthat within the objectâto an equivalent steady state system. That
is, the method assumes that the temperature within the object is completely
uniform, although its value may be changing in time.
In this method, the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object
to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object's boundary, known
as the Biot_number, is calculated. For small Biot numbers, the approximation of
spatially uniform temperature within the object can be used: it can be presumed
that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself,
due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to
heat entering the object.[25]
**** Climate models[edit] ****
Climate_models study the radiant_heat_transfer by using quantitative methods to
simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.
***** Engineering[edit] *****
Heat exposure as part of a fire test for firestop products
Heat transfer has broad application to the functioning of numerous devices and
systems. Heat-transfer principles may be used to preserve, increase, or
decrease temperature in a wide variety of circumstances.[citation_needed] Heat
transfer methods are used in numerous disciplines, such as automotive
engineering, thermal_management_of_electronic_devices_and_systems, climate
control, insulation, materials_processing, and power_station engineering.
**** Insulation, radiance and resistance[edit] ****
Thermal_insulators are materials specifically designed to reduce the flow of
heat by limiting conduction, convection, or both. Thermal_resistance is a heat
property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat
flow (heat per time unit or thermal resistance) to temperature difference.
Radiance or spectral radiance are measures of the quantity of radiation that
passes through or is emitted. Radiant_barriers are materials that reflect
radiation, and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources. Good
insulators are not necessarily good radiant barriers, and vice versa. Metal,
for instance, is an excellent reflector and a poor insulator.
The effectiveness of a radiant barrier is indicated by its reflectivity, which
is the fraction of radiation reflected. A material with a high reflectivity (at
a given wavelength) has a low emissivity (at that same wavelength), and vice
versa. At any specific wavelength, reflectivity=1 - emissivity. An ideal
radiant barrier would have a reflectivity of 1, and would therefore reflect 100
percent of incoming radiation. Vacuum_flasks, or Dewars, are silvered to
approach this ideal. In the vacuum of space, satellites use multi-layer
insulation, which consists of many layers of aluminized (shiny) Mylar to
greatly reduce radiation heat transfer and control satellite temperature.
[citation_needed]
**** Devices[edit] ****
Schematic flow of energy in a heat engine.
A heat_engine is a system that performs the conversion of a flow of thermal
energy (heat) to mechanical_energy to perform mechanical_work.[26][27]
A thermocouple is a temperature-measuring device and widely used type of
temperature sensor for measurement and control, and can also be used to convert
heat into electric power.
A thermoelectric_cooler is a solid state electronic device that pumps
(transfers) heat from one side of the device to the other when electric current
is passed through it. It is based on the Peltier_effect.
A thermal_diode or thermal_rectifier is a device that causes heat to flow
preferentially in one direction.
*** Heat exchangers[edit] ***
A heat_exchanger is used for more efficient heat transfer or to dissipate heat.
Heat exchangers are widely used in refrigeration, air_conditioning, space
heating, power_generation, and chemical processing. One common example of a
heat exchanger is a car's radiator, in which the hot coolant_fluid is cooled by
the flow of air over the radiator's surface.[citation_needed][28]
Common types of heat exchanger flows include parallel flow, counter flow, and
cross flow. In parallel flow, both fluids move in the same direction while
transferring heat; in counter flow, the fluids move in opposite directions; and
in cross flow, the fluids move at right_angles to each other. Common types of
heat exchangers include shell_and_tube, double_pipe, extruded finned pipe,
spiral fin pipe, u-tube, and stacked plate. Each type has certain advantages
and disadvantages over other types.[further_explanation_needed]
A heat_sink is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid
material to a fluid medium, such as air or a liquid. Examples of heat sinks are
the heat exchangers used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems or the
radiator in a car. A heat_pipe is another heat-transfer device that combines
thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently transfer heat between
two solid interfaces.
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Architecture[edit] ****
Efficient_energy_use is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required in
heating or cooling. In architecture, condensation and air_currents can cause
cosmetic or structural damage. An energy_audit can help to assess the
implementation of recommended corrective procedures. For instance, insulation
improvements, air sealing of structural leaks or the addition of energy-
efficient windows and doors.[29]
    * Smart_meter is a device that records electric energy consumption in
      intervals.
    * Thermal_transmittance is the rate of transfer of heat through a structure
      divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. It is
      expressed in watts per square meter per kelvin, or W/(mÂ²K). Well-
      insulated parts of a building have a low thermal transmittance, whereas
      poorly-insulated parts of a building have a high thermal transmittance.
    * Thermostat is a device to monitor and control temperature.
**** Climate engineering[edit] ****
See also: Anthropogenic_heat
An example application in climate engineering includes the creation of Biochar
through the pyrolysis process. Thus, storing greenhouse gases in carbon reduces
the radiative forcing capacity in the atmosphere, causing more long-wave
(infrared) radiation out to Space.
Climate_engineering consists of carbon_dioxide_removal and solar_radiation
management. Since the amount of carbon_dioxide determines the radiative_balance
of Earth atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal techniques can be applied to reduce
the radiative_forcing. Solar radiation management is the attempt to absorb less
solar radiation to offset the effects of greenhouse_gases.
**** Greenhouse effect[edit] ****
A representation of the exchanges of energy between the source (the Sun), the
Earth's surface, the Earth's_atmosphere, and the ultimate sink outer_space. The
ability of the atmosphere to capture and recycle energy emitted by the Earth
surface is the defining characteristic of the greenhouse effect.
The greenhouse_effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary
surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all
directions. Since part of this re-radiation is back towards the surface and the
lower atmosphere, it results in an elevation of the average surface temperature
above what it would be in the absence of the gases.
**** Heat transfer in the human body[edit] ****
See also: Wet-bulb_temperature
The principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the
human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat. Heat is produced
in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for
the systems of the body.[30] The human body must maintain a consistent internal
temperature in order to maintain healthy bodily functions. Therefore, excess
heat must be dissipated from the body to keep it from overheating. When a
person engages in elevated levels of physical activity, the body requires
additional fuel which increases the metabolic rate and the rate of heat
production. The body must then use additional methods to remove the additional
heat produced in order to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level.
Heat_transfer_by_convection is driven by the movement of fluids over the
surface of the body. This convective fluid can be either a liquid or a gas. For
heat transfer from the outer surface of the body, the convection mechanism is
dependent on the surface area of the body, the velocity of the air, and the
temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air.[31]
The normal temperature of the body is approximately 37 Â°C. Heat transfer
occurs more readily when the temperature of the surroundings is significantly
less than the normal body temperature. This concept explains why a person feels
cold when not enough covering is worn when exposed to a cold environment.
Clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to
heat flow over the covered portion of the body.[32] This thermal resistance
causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the
temperature on the surface of the skin. This smaller temperature gradient
between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower
rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered.
In order to ensure that one portion of the body is not significantly hotter
than another portion, heat must be distributed evenly through the bodily
tissues. Blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and
helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body.
This flow of blood through the vessels can be modeled as pipe flow in an
engineering system. The heat carried by the blood is determined by the
temperature of the surrounding tissue, the diameter of the blood vessel, the
thickness_of_the_fluid, velocity of the flow, and the heat transfer coefficient
of the blood. The velocity, blood vessel diameter, and the fluid thickness can
all be related with the Reynolds_Number, a dimensionless number used in fluid
mechanics to characterize the flow of fluids.
Latent_heat loss, also known as evaporative heat loss, accounts for a large
fraction of heat loss from the body. When the core temperature of the body
increases, the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional
moisture to the surface of the skin. The liquid is then transformed into vapor
which removes heat from the surface of the body.[33] The rate of evaporation
heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the
amount of moisture present on the skin.[31] Therefore, the maximum of heat
transfer will occur when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously
loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs
during periods of increased physical activity.
**** Cooling techniques[edit] ****
*** Evaporative cooling[edit] ***
A traditional air cooler in Mirzapur, Uttar_Pradesh, India
Evaporative_cooling happens when water vapor is added to the surrounding air.
The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of
sensible heat and converted into latent heat, while the air remains at a
constant enthalpy. Latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to
evaporate the liquid; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the
surrounding gas and surfaces. The greater the difference between the two
temperatures, the greater the evaporative cooling effect. When the temperatures
are the same, no net evaporation of water in air occurs; thus, there is no
cooling effect.
*** Laser cooling[edit] ***
In quantum_physics, laser_cooling is used to achieve temperatures of near
absolute_zero (â273.15 Â°C, â459.67 Â°F) of atomic and molecular samples to
observe unique quantum_effects that can only occur at this heat level.
    * Doppler_cooling is the most common method of laser cooling.
    * Sympathetic_cooling is a process in which particles of one type cool
      particles of another type. Typically, atomic ions that can be directly
      laser-cooled are used to cool nearby ions or atoms. This technique allows
      cooling of ions and atoms that cannot be laser cooled directly.[citation
      needed]
*** Magnetic cooling[edit] ***
Main articles: Magnetic_refrigeration and Magnetic_evaporative_cooling
Magnetic_evaporative_cooling is a process for lowering the temperature of a
group of atoms, after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling. Magnetic
refrigeration cools below 0.3K, by making use of the magnetocaloric_effect.
*** Radiative cooling[edit] ***
Radiative_cooling is the process by which a body loses heat by radiation.
Outgoing energy is an important effect in the Earth's_energy_budget. In the
case of the Earth-atmosphere system, it refers to the process by which long-
wave (infrared) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave
(visible) energy from the Sun. Convective transport of heat and evaporative
transport of latent heat both remove heat from the surface and redistribute it
in the atmosphere.
**** Thermal energy storage[edit] ****
Thermal_energy_storage includes technologies for collecting and storing_energy
for later use. It may be employed to balance energy demand between day and
nighttime. The thermal reservoir may be maintained at a temperature above or
below that of the ambient environment. Applications include space heating,
domestic or process hot water systems, or generating electricity.
