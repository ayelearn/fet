Tubular heat exchanger
A heat exchanger is a system used to transfer heat between two or more fluids.
Heat exchangers are used in both cooling and heating processes.[1] The fluids
may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing or they may be in direct
contact.[2] They are widely used in space_heating, refrigeration, air
conditioning, power_stations, chemical_plants, petrochemical_plants, petroleum
refineries, natural-gas_processing, and sewage_treatment. The classic example
of a heat exchanger is found in an internal_combustion_engine in which a
circulating fluid known as engine_coolant flows through radiator coils and air
flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air.
Another example is the heat_sink, which is a passive heat exchanger that
transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid
medium, often air or a liquid coolant.[3]

***** Flow arrangement[edit] *****
Countercurrent (A) and parallel (B) flows
    * Fig. 1: Shell_and_tube_heat_exchanger, single pass (1â1 parallel flow)
    * Fig. 2: Shell and tube heat exchanger, 2-pass tube side (1â2 crossflow)
    * Fig. 3: Shell and tube heat exchanger, 2-pass shell side, 2-pass tube
      side (2-2 countercurrent)
There are three primary classifications of heat exchangers according to their
flow arrangement. In parallel-flow heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the
exchanger at the same end, and travel in parallel to one another to the other
side. In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from
opposite ends. The counter current design is the most efficient, in that it can
transfer the most heat from the heat (transfer) medium per unit mass due to the
fact that the average temperature difference along any unit length is higher.
See countercurrent_exchange. In a cross-flow heat exchanger, the fluids travel
roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger.
For efficiency, heat exchangers are designed to maximize the surface area of
the wall between the two fluids, while minimizing resistance to fluid flow
through the exchanger. The exchanger's performance can also be affected by the
addition of fins or corrugations in one or both directions, which increase
surface area and may channel fluid flow or induce turbulence.
The driving temperature across the heat transfer surface varies with position,
but an appropriate mean temperature can be defined. In most simple systems this
is the "log_mean_temperature_difference" (LMTD). Sometimes direct knowledge of
the LMTD is not available and the NTU_method is used.
***** Types[edit] *****
Double pipe heat exchangers are the simplest exchangers used in industries. On
one hand, these heat exchangers are cheap for both design and maintenance,
making them a good choice for small industries. On the other hand, their low
efficiency coupled with the high space occupied in large scales, has led modern
industries to use more efficient heat exchangers like shell and tube or plate.
However, since double pipe heat exchangers are simple, they are used to teach
heat exchanger design basics to students as the fundamental rules for all heat
exchangers are the same.
**** Shell and tube heat exchanger[edit] ****
A shell and tube heat exchanger
Main article: Shell_and_tube_heat_exchanger
Shell and tube heat exchangers consist of a series of tubes which contain fluid
that must be either heated or cooled. A second fluid runs over the tubes that
are being heated or cooled so that it can either provide the heat or absorb the
heat required. A set of tubes is called the tube bundle and can be made up of
several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc. Shell and tube heat
exchangers are typically used for high-pressure applications (with pressures
greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260 Â°C).[4] This is because
the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape.
Several thermal design features must be considered when designing the tubes in
the shell and tube heat exchangers: There can be many variations on the shell
and tube design. Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums
(sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be
straight or bent in the shape of a U, called U-tubes.
    * Tube diameter: Using a small tube diameter makes the heat exchanger both
      economical and compact. However, it is more likely for the heat exchanger
      to foul up faster and the small size makes mechanical cleaning of the
      fouling difficult. To prevail over the fouling and cleaning problems,
      larger tube diameters can be used. Thus to determine the tube diameter,
      the available space, cost and fouling nature of the fluids must be
      considered.
    * Tube thickness: The thickness of the wall of the tubes is usually
      determined to ensure:
          o There is enough room for corrosion
          o That flow-induced vibration has resistance
          o Axial strength
          o Availability of spare parts
          o Hoop strength (to withstand internal tube pressure)
          o Buckling strength (to withstand overpressure in the shell)
    * Tube length: heat exchangers are usually cheaper when they have a smaller
      shell diameter and a long tube length. Thus, typically there is an aim to
      make the heat exchanger as long as physically possible whilst not
      exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations
      for this, including space available at the installation site and the need
      to ensure tubes are available in lengths that are twice the required
      length (so they can be withdrawn and replaced). Also, long, thin tubes
      are difficult to take out and replace.
    * Tube pitch: when designing the tubes, it is practical to ensure that the
      tube pitch (i.e., the centre-centre distance of adjoining tubes) is not
      less than 1.25 times the tubes' outside diameter. A larger tube pitch
      leads to a larger overall shell diameter, which leads to a more expensive
      heat exchanger.
    * Tube corrugation: this type of tubes, mainly used for the inner tubes,
      increases the turbulence of the fluids and the effect is very important
      in the heat transfer giving a better performance.
    * Tube Layout: refers to how tubes are positioned within the shell. There
      are four main types of tube layout, which are, triangular (30Â°), rotated
      triangular (60Â°), square (90Â°) and rotated square (45Â°). The
      triangular patterns are employed to give greater heat transfer as they
      force the fluid to flow in a more turbulent fashion around the piping.
      Square patterns are employed where high fouling is experienced and
      cleaning is more regular.
    * Baffle Design: baffles are used in shell and tube heat exchangers to
      direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the
      shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long
      length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The most common
      type of baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental
      baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the
      fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle
      spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube
      heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the
      conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic
      optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than
      20% of the shellâs inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely
      causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently,
      having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler
      spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the
      baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main
      type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two
      concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst
      the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the
      fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut
      baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.
Fixed tube liquid-cooled heat exchangers especially suitable for marine and
harsh applications can be assembled with brass shells, copper tubes, brass
baffles, and forged brass integral end hubs.[5] (See: Copper_in_heat
exchangers).

**** Plate heat exchangers[edit] ****
Main article: Plate_heat_exchanger
Another type of heat exchanger is the plate_heat_exchanger. These exchangers
are composed of many thin, slightly separated plates that have very large
surface areas and small fluid flow passages for heat transfer. Advances in
gasket and brazing technology have made the plate-type heat exchanger
increasingly practical. In HVAC applications, large heat exchangers of this
type are called plate-and-frame; when used in open loops, these heat exchangers
are normally of the gasket type to allow periodic disassembly, cleaning, and
inspection. There are many types of permanently bonded plate heat exchangers,
such as dip-brazed, vacuum-brazed, and welded plate varieties, and they are
often specified for closed-loop applications such as refrigeration. Plate heat
exchangers also differ in the types of plates that are used, and in the
configurations of those plates. Some plates may be stamped with "chevron",
dimpled, or other patterns, where others may have machined fins and/or grooves.
When compared to shell and tube exchangers, the stacked-plate arrangement
typically has lower volume and cost. Another difference between the two is that
plate exchangers typically serve low to medium pressure fluids, compared to
medium and high pressures of shell and tube. A third and important difference
is that plate exchangers employ more countercurrent flow rather than cross
current flow, which allows lower approach temperature differences, high
temperature changes, and increased efficiencies.
**** Plate and shell heat exchanger[edit] ****
A third type of heat exchanger is a plate and shell heat exchanger, which
combines plate heat exchanger with shell and tube heat exchanger technologies.
The heart of the heat exchanger contains a fully welded circular plate pack
made by pressing and cutting round plates and welding them together. Nozzles
carry flow in and out of the platepack (the 'Plate side' flowpath). The fully
welded platepack is assembled into an outer shell that creates a second
flowpath ( the 'Shell side'). Plate and shell technology offers high heat
transfer, high pressure, high operating_temperature, uling and close approach
temperature. In particular, it does completely without gaskets, which provides
security against leakage at high pressures and temperatures.
**** Adiabatic wheel heat exchanger[edit] ****
A fourth type of heat exchanger uses an intermediate fluid or solid store to
hold heat, which is then moved to the other side of the heat exchanger to be
released. Two examples of this are adiabatic wheels, which consist of a large
wheel with fine threads rotating through the hot and cold fluids, and fluid
heat exchangers.
**** Plate fin heat exchanger[edit] ****
Main article: Plate_fin_heat_exchanger
This type of heat exchanger uses "sandwiched" passages containing fins to
increase the effectiveness of the unit. The designs include crossflow and
counterflow coupled with various fin configurations such as straight fins,
offset fins and wavy fins.
Plate and fin heat exchangers are usually made of aluminum alloys, which
provide high heat transfer efficiency. The material enables the system to
operate at a lower temperature difference and reduce the weight of the
equipment. Plate and fin heat exchangers are mostly used for low temperature
services such as natural gas, helium and oxygen liquefaction plants, air
separation plants and transport industries such as motor and aircraft_engines.
Advantages of plate and fin heat exchangers:
    * High heat transfer efficiency especially in gas treatment
    * Larger heat transfer area
    * Approximately 5 times lighter in weight than that of shell and tube heat
      exchanger.
    * Able to withstand high pressure
Disadvantages of plate and fin heat exchangers:
    * Might cause clogging as the pathways are very narrow
    * Difficult to clean the pathways
    * Aluminium alloys are susceptible to Mercury_Liquid_Embrittlement Failure
**** Pillow plate heat exchanger[edit] ****
A pillow_plate_exchanger is commonly used in the dairy industry for cooling
milk in large direct-expansion stainless steel bulk_tanks. The pillow plate
allows for cooling across nearly the entire surface area of the tank, without
gaps that would occur between pipes welded to the exterior of the tank.
The pillow plate is constructed using a thin sheet of metal spot-welded to the
surface of another thicker sheet of metal. The thin plate is welded in a
regular pattern of dots or with a serpentine pattern of weld lines. After
welding the enclosed space is pressurised with sufficient force to cause the
thin metal to bulge out around the welds, providing a space for heat exchanger
liquids to flow, and creating a characteristic appearance of a swelled pillow
formed out of metal.
**** Fluid heat exchangers[edit] ****
This is a heat exchanger with a gas passing upwards through a shower of fluid
(often water), and the fluid is then taken elsewhere before being cooled. This
is commonly used for cooling gases whilst also removing certain impurities,
thus solving two problems at once. It is widely used in espresso machines as an
energy-saving method of cooling super-heated water to use in the extraction of
espresso.
**** Waste heat recovery units[edit] ****

A waste_heat_recovery_unit (WHRU) is a heat exchanger that recovers heat from a
hot gas stream while transferring it to a working medium, typically water or
oils. The hot gas stream can be the exhaust gas from a gas turbine or a diesel
engine or a waste gas from industry or refinery.
Large systems with high volume and temperature gas streams, typical in
industry, can benefit from steam Rankine_cycle (SRC) in a waste heat recovery
unit, but these cycles are too expensive for small systems. The recovery of
heat from low temperature systems requires different working fluids than steam.
An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) waste heat recovery unit can be more efficient
at low temperature range using refrigerants that boil at lower temperatures
than water. Typical organic refrigerants are ammonia, pentafluoropropane (R-
245fa and R-245ca), and toluene.
The refrigerant is boiled by the heat source in the evaporator to produce
super-heated vapor. This fluid is expanded in the turbine to convert thermal
energy to kinetic energy, that is converted to electricity in the electrical
generator. This energy transfer process decreases the temperature of the
refrigerant that, in turn, condenses. The cycle is closed and completed using a
pump to send the fluid back to the evaporator.
**** Dynamic scraped surface heat exchanger[edit] ****
Another type of heat exchanger is called "(dynamic)_scraped_surface_heat
exchanger". This is mainly used for heating or cooling with high-viscosity
products, crystallization processes, evaporation and high-fouling applications.
Long running times are achieved due to the continuous scraping of the surface,
thus avoiding fouling and achieving a sustainable heat transfer rate during the
process.
**** Phase-change heat exchangers[edit] ****
Typical kettle reboiler used for industrial distillation towers
Typical water-cooled surface condenser
In addition to heating up or cooling down fluids in just a single phase, heat
exchangers can be used either to heat a liquid to evaporate (or boil) it or
used as condensers to cool a vapor and condense it to a liquid. In chemical
plants and refineries, reboilers used to heat incoming feed for distillation
towers are often heat exchangers.[6][7]
Distillation set-ups typically use condensers to condense distillate vapors
back into liquid.
Power_plants that use steam-driven turbines commonly use heat exchangers to
boil water into steam. Heat exchangers or similar units for producing steam
from water are often called boilers or steam generators.
In the nuclear power plants called pressurized_water_reactors, special large
heat exchangers pass heat from the primary (reactor plant) system to the
secondary (steam plant) system, producing steam from water in the process.
These are called steam_generators. All fossil-fueled and nuclear power plants
using steam-driven turbines have surface_condensers to convert the exhaust
steam from the turbines into condensate (water) for re-use.[8][9]
To conserve_energy and cooling_capacity in chemical and other plants,
regenerative heat exchangers can transfer heat from a stream that must be
cooled to another stream that must be heated, such as distillate cooling and
reboiler feed pre-heating.
This term can also refer to heat exchangers that contain a material within
their structure that has a change of phase. This is usually a solid to liquid
phase due to the small volume difference between these states. This change of
phase effectively acts as a buffer because it occurs at a constant temperature
but still allows for the heat exchanger to accept additional heat. One example
where this has been investigated is for use in high power aircraft electronics.
Heat exchangers functioning in multiphase flow regimes may be subject to the
Ledinegg_instability.
**** Direct contact heat exchangers[edit] ****
Direct contact heat exchangers involve heat transfer between hot and cold
streams of two phases in the absence of a separating wall.[10] Thus such heat
exchangers can be classified as:
    * Gas â liquid
    * Immiscible liquid â liquid
    * Solid-liquid or solid â gas
Most direct contact heat exchangers fall under the Gas â Liquid category,
where heat is transferred between a gas and liquid in the form of drops, films
or sprays.[4]
Such types of heat exchangers are used predominantly in air_conditioning,
humidification, industrial hot water heating, water_cooling and condensing
plants.[11]

**** Microchannel heat exchangers[edit] ****
Microchannel heat exchangers are multi-pass parallel flow heat exchangers
consisting of three main elements: manifolds (inlet and outlet), multi-port
tubes with the hydraulic diameters smaller than 1mm, and fins. All the elements
usually brazed together using controllable atmosphere brazing process.
Microchannel heat exchangers are characterized by high heat transfer ratio, low
refrigerant charges, compact size, and lower airside pressure drops compared to
finned tube heat exchangers. Microchannel heat exchangers are widely used in
automotive industry as the car radiators, and as condenser, evaporator, and
cooling/heating coils in HVAC industry.
Main article: Micro_heat_exchanger
Micro heat exchangers, Micro-scale heat exchangers, or microstructured heat
exchangers are heat exchangers in which (at least one) fluid flows in lateral
confinements with typical dimensions below 1 mm. The most typical such
confinement are microchannels, which are channels with a hydraulic_diameter
below 1 mm. Microchannel heat exchangers can be made from metal, ceramic,[13]
Microchannel heat exchangers can be used for many applications including:
    * high-performance aircraft gas_turbine_engines[14]
    * heat_pumps[15]
    * air_conditioning [16]
***** HVAC air coils[edit] *****
One of the widest uses of heat exchangers is for air_conditioning of buildings
and vehicles. This class of heat exchangers is commonly called air coils, or
just coils due to their often-serpentine internal tubing. Liquid-to-air, or
air-to-liquid HVAC coils are typically of modified crossflow arrangement. In
vehicles, heat coils are often called heater_cores.
On the liquid side of these heat exchangers, the common fluids are water, a
water-glycol solution, steam, or a refrigerant. For heating coils, hot water
and steam are the most common, and this heated fluid is supplied by boilers,
for example. For cooling coils, chilled water and refrigerant are most common.
Chilled water is supplied from a chiller that is potentially located very far
away, but refrigerant must come from a nearby condensing unit. When a
refrigerant is used, the cooling coil is the evaporator in the vapor-
compression_refrigeration cycle. HVAC coils that use this direct-expansion of
refrigerants are commonly called DX coils. Some DX coils are "microchannel"
type.[17]
On the air side of HVAC coils a significant difference exists between those
used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is
cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air
flows. Heating some air increases that airflow's capacity to hold water. So
heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but
cooling coils must be adequately designed and selected to handle their
particular latent (moisture) as well as the sensible (cooling) loads. The water
that is removed is called condensate.
For many climates, water or steam HVAC coils can be exposed to freezing
conditions. Because water expands upon freezing, these somewhat expensive and
difficult to replace thin-walled heat exchangers can easily be damaged or
destroyed by just one freeze. As such, freeze protection of coils is a major
concern of HVAC designers, installers, and operators.
The introduction of indentations placed within the heat exchange fins
controlled condensation, allowing water molecules to remain in the cooled air.
This invention allowed for refrigeration without icing of the cooling
mechanism.[18]
The heat exchangers in direct-combustion furnaces, typical in many residences,
are not 'coils'. They are, instead, gas-to-air heat exchangers that are
typically made of stamped steel sheet metal. The combustion products pass on
one side of these heat exchangers, and air to heat on the other. A cracked heat
exchanger is therefore a dangerous situation that requires immediate attention
because combustion products may enter living space.
***** Helical-coil heat exchangers[edit] *****
Helical-Coil Heat Exchanger sketch, which consists of a shell, core, and tubes
(Scott_S._Haraburda design).
Although double-pipe heat exchangers are the simplest to design, the better
choice in the following cases would be the helical-coil heat exchanger (HCHE):
    * The main advantage of the HCHE, like that for the Spiral heat exchanger
      (SHE), is its highly efficient use of space, especially when itâs
      limited and not enough straight pipe can be laid.[19]
    * Under conditions of low flowrates (or laminar_flow), such that the
      typical shell-and-tube exchangers have low heat-transfer coefficients and
      becoming uneconomical.[19]
    * When there is low pressure in one of the fluids, usually from accumulated
      pressure drops in other process equipment.[19]
    * When one of the fluids has components in multiple phases (solids,
      liquids, and gases), which tends to create mechanical problems during
      operations, such as plugging of small-diameter tubes.[20] Cleaning of
      helical coils for these multiple-phase fluids can prove to be more
      difficult than its shell and tube counterpart; however the helical coil
      unit would require cleaning less often.
These have been used in the nuclear industry as a method for exchanging heat in
a sodium_system for large liquid_metal_fast_breeder_reactors since the early
1970s, using an HCHE device invented by Charles_E._Boardman and John_H._Germer.
[21] There are several simple methods for designing HCHE for all types of
manufacturing industries, such as using the Ramachandra_K._Patil (et al.)
method from India and the Scott_S._Haraburda method from the United_States.[19]
[20]
However, these are based upon assumptions of estimating inside heat transfer
coefficient, predicting flow around the outside of the coil, and upon constant
heat flux.[22] Yet, recent experimental data revealed that the empirical
correlations are quite in agreement for designing circular and square pattern
HCHEs.[23] During studies published in 2015, several researchers found that the
boundary conditions of the outer wall of exchangers were essentially constant
heat flux conditions in power plant boilers, condensers and evaporators; while
convective heat transfer conditions were more appropriate in food, automobile
and process industries.[24]
***** Spiral heat exchangers[edit] *****
Schematic drawing of a spiral heat exchanger.
A modification to the perpendicular flow of the typical HCHE involves the
replacement of shell with another coiled tube, allowing the two fluids to flow
parallel to one another, and which requires the use of different design
calculations.[25] These are the Spiral Heat Exchangers (SHE), which may refer
to a helical (coiled) tube configuration, more generally, the term refers to a
pair of flat surfaces that are coiled to form the two channels in a counter-
flow arrangement. Each of the two channels has one long curved path. A pair of
fluid ports are connected tangentially to the outer arms of the spiral, and
axial ports are common, but optional.[26]
The main advantage of the SHE is its highly efficient use of space. This
attribute is often leveraged and partially reallocated to gain other
improvements in performance, according to well known tradeoffs in heat
exchanger design. (A notable tradeoff is capital cost vs operating cost.) A
compact SHE may be used to have a smaller footprint and thus lower all-around
capital costs, or an oversized SHE may be used to have less pressure drop, less
pumping energy, higher thermal_efficiency, and lower energy costs.
**** Construction[edit] ****
The distance between the sheets in the spiral channels is maintained by using
spacer studs that were welded prior to rolling. Once the main spiral pack has
been rolled, alternate top and bottom edges are welded and each end closed by a
gasketed flat or conical cover bolted to the body. This ensures no mixing of
the two fluids occurs. Any leakage is from the periphery cover to the
atmosphere, or to a passage that contains the same fluid.[27]
**** Self cleaning[edit] ****
Spiral heat exchangers are often used in the heating of fluids that contain
solids and thus tend to foul the inside of the heat exchanger. The low pressure
drop lets the SHE handle fouling more easily. The SHE uses a âself
cleaningâ mechanism, whereby fouled surfaces cause a localized increase in
fluid velocity, thus increasing the drag (or fluid friction) on the fouled
surface, thus helping to dislodge the blockage and keep the heat exchanger
clean. "The internal walls that make up the heat transfer surface are often
rather thick, which makes the SHE very robust, and able to last a long time in
demanding environments."[citation_needed] They are also easily cleaned, opening
out like an oven where any buildup of foulant can be removed by pressure
washing.
Self-cleaning water filters are used to keep the system clean and running
without the need to shut down or replace cartridges and bags.
**** Flow arrangements[edit] ****
A comparison between the operations and effects of a cocurrent and a
countercurrent flow exchange system is depicted by the upper and lower diagrams
respectively. In both it is assumed (and indicated) that red has a higher value
(e.g. of temperature) than blue and that the property being transported in the
channels therefore flows from red to blue. Note that channels are contiguous if
effective exchange is to occur (i.e. there can be no gap between the channels).
There are three main types of flows in a spiral heat exchanger:
    * Counter-current Flow: Fluids flow in opposite directions. These are used
      for liquid-liquid, condensing and gas cooling applications. Units are
      usually mounted vertically when condensing vapour and mounted
      horizontally when handling high concentrations of solids.
    * Spiral Flow/Cross Flow: One fluid is in spiral flow and the other in a
      cross flow. Spiral flow passages are welded at each side for this type of
      spiral heat exchanger. This type of flow is suitable for handling low
      density gas, which passes through the cross flow, avoiding pressure loss.
      It can be used for liquid-liquid applications if one liquid has a
      considerably greater flow rate than the other.
    * Distributed Vapour/Spiral flow: This design is that of a condenser, and
      is usually mounted vertically. It is designed to cater for the sub-
      cooling of both condensate and non-condensables. The coolant moves in a
      spiral and leaves via the top. Hot gases that enter leave as condensate
      via the bottom outlet.
**** Applications[edit] ****
The Spiral heat exchanger is good for applications such as pasteurization,
digester heating, heat recovery, pre-heating (see: recuperator), and effluent
cooling. For sludge treatment, SHEs are generally smaller than other types of
heat exchangers. [28] These are used to transfer the heat.
***** Selection[edit] *****
Due to the many variables involved, selecting optimal heat exchangers is
challenging. Hand calculations are possible, but many iterations are typically
needed. As such, heat exchangers are most often selected via computer programs,
either by system designers, who are typically engineers, or by equipment
vendors.
To select an appropriate heat exchanger, the system designers (or equipment
vendors) would firstly consider the design limitations for each heat exchanger
type. Though cost is often the primary criterion, several other selection
criteria are important:
    * High/low pressure limits
    * Thermal performance
    * Temperature ranges
    * Product mix (liquid/liquid, particulates or high-solids liquid)
    * Pressure drops across the exchanger
    * Fluid flow capacity
    * Cleanability, maintenance and repair
    * Materials required for construction
    * Ability and ease of future expansion
    * Material selection, such as copper, aluminium, carbon_steel, stainless
      steel, nickel_alloys, ceramic, polymer, and titanium.
Small-diameter coil technologies are becoming more popular in modern air
conditioning and refrigeration systems because they have better rates of heat
transfer than conventional sized condenser and evaporator coils with round
copper tubes and aluminum or copper fin that have been the standard in the HVAC
industry. Small diameter coils can withstand the higher pressures required by
the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Two small
diameter coil technologies are currently available for air conditioning and
refrigeration products: copper_microgroove[29] and brazed aluminum
microchannel.[30]
Choosing the right heat exchanger (HX) requires some knowledge of the different
heat exchanger types, as well as the environment where the unit must operate.
Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat
exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product.
For example, a kettle HX for pre-heating, a double pipe HX for the
âcarrierâ fluid and a plate and frame HX for final cooling. With sufficient
knowledge of heat exchanger types and operating requirements, an appropriate
selection can be made to optimise the process.[31]
***** Monitoring and maintenance[edit] *****
Online monitoring of commercial heat exchangers is done by tracking the overall
heat transfer coefficient. The overall heat transfer coefficient tends to
decline over time due to fouling.
U=Q/AÎTlm
By periodically calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient from
exchanger flow rates and temperatures, the owner of the heat exchanger can
estimate when cleaning the heat exchanger is economically attractive.
Integrity inspection of plate and tubular heat exchanger can be tested in situ
by the conductivity or helium gas methods. These methods confirm the integrity
of the plates or tubes to prevent any cross contamination and the condition of
the gaskets.
Mechanical integrity monitoring of heat exchanger tubes may be conducted
through Nondestructive_methods such as eddy_current testing.
**** Fouling[edit] ****
Main article: Fouling
A heat exchanger in a steam power station contaminated with macrofouling.
Fouling occurs when impurities deposit on the heat exchange surface. Deposition
of these impurities can decrease heat transfer effectiveness significantly over
time and are caused by:
    * Low wall shear stress
    * Low fluid velocities
    * High fluid velocities
    * Reaction product solid precipitation
    * Precipitation of dissolved impurities due to elevated wall temperatures
The rate of heat exchanger fouling is determined by the rate of particle
deposition less re-entrainment/suppression. This model was originally proposed
in 1959 by Kern and Seaton.
Crude Oil Exchanger Fouling. In commercial crude oil refining, crude oil is
heated from 21 Â°C (70 Â°F) to 343 Â°C (649 Â°F) prior to entering the
distillation column. A series of shell and tube heat exchangers typically
exchange heat between crude oil and other oil streams to heat the crude to
260 Â°C (500 Â°F) prior to heating in a furnace. Fouling occurs on the crude
side of these exchangers due to asphaltene insolubility. The nature of
asphaltene solubility in crude oil was successfully modeled by Wiehe and
Kennedy.[32] The precipitation of insoluble asphaltenes in crude preheat trains
has been successfully modeled as a first order reaction by Ebert and Panchal
[33] who expanded on the work of Kern and Seaton.
Cooling Water Fouling. Cooling water systems are susceptible to fouling.
Cooling water typically has a high total dissolved solids content and suspended
colloidal solids. Localized precipitation of dissolved solids occurs at the
heat exchange surface due to wall temperatures higher than bulk fluid
temperature. Low fluid velocities (less than 3 ft/s) allow suspended solids to
settle on the heat exchange surface. Cooling water is typically on the tube
side of a shell and tube exchanger because it's easy to clean. To prevent
fouling, designers typically ensure that cooling water velocity is greater than
0.9 m/s and bulk fluid temperature is maintained less than 60 Â°C (140 Â°F).
Other approaches to control fouling control combine the "blind" application of
biocides and anti-scale chemicals with periodic lab testing.
**** Maintenance[edit] ****
Plate and frame heat exchangers can be disassembled and cleaned periodically.
Tubular heat exchangers can be cleaned by such methods as acid cleaning,
sandblasting, high-pressure_water_jet, bullet cleaning, or drill rods.
In large-scale cooling water systems for heat exchangers, water_treatment such
as purification, addition of chemicals, and testing, is used to minimize
fouling of the heat exchange equipment. Other water treatment is also used in
steam systems for power plants, etc. to minimize fouling and corrosion of the
heat exchange and other equipment.
A variety of companies have started using water borne oscillations technology
to prevent biofouling. Without the use of chemicals, this type of technology
has helped in providing a low-pressure drop in heat exchangers.
***** In nature[edit] *****
**** Humans[edit] ****
The human nasal passages serve as a heat exchanger, with cool air being inhaled
and warm air being exhaled. Its effectiveness can be demonstrated by putting
the hand in front of the face and exhaling, first through the nose and then
through the mouth. Air exhaled through the nose is substantially cooler.[34]
[35] This effect can be enhanced with clothing, by, for example, wearing a
scarf over the face while breathing in cold weather.
In species that have external testes (such as human), the artery to the testis
is surrounded by a mesh of veins called the pampiniform_plexus. This cools the
blood heading to the testes, while reheating the returning blood.
**** Birds, fish, marine mammals[edit] ****
Counter-current exchange conservation circuit
Further information: Counter-current_exchange_in_biological_systems
"Countercurrent" heat exchangers occur naturally in the circulation system of
fish, whales and other marine_mammals. Arteries to the skin carrying warm blood
are intertwined with veins from the skin carrying cold blood, causing the warm
arterial blood to exchange heat with the cold venous blood. This reduces the
overall heat loss in cold water. Heat exchangers are also present in the tongue
of baleen_whales as large volume of water flow through their mouths.[36][37]
Wading birds use a similar system to limit heat losses from their body through
their legs into the water.
**** Carotid rete[edit] ****
The carotid rete is a counter-current heat exchanging organ in some ungulates.
The blood ascending the carotid arteries on its way to the brain, flows via a
network of vessels where heat is discharged to the veins of cooler blood
descending from the nasal passages. The carotid rete allows Thomson's_gazelle
to maintain its brain almost 3 Â°C (5.4 Â°F) cooler than the rest of the body,
and therefore aids in tolerating bursts in metabolic heat production such as
associated with outrunning cheetahs (during which the body temperature exceeds
the maximum temperature at which the brain could function).[38]
***** In industry[edit] *****
Heat exchangers are widely used in industry both for cooling and heating large
scale industrial processes. The type and size of heat exchanger used can be
tailored to suit a process depending on the type of fluid, its phase,
temperature, density, viscosity, pressures, chemical composition and various
other thermodynamic properties.
In many industrial processes there is waste of energy or a heat stream that is
being exhausted, heat exchangers can be used to recover this heat and put it to
use by heating a different stream in the process. This practice saves a lot of
money in industry, as the heat supplied to other streams from the heat
exchangers would otherwise come from an external source that is more expensive
and more harmful to the environment.
Heat exchangers are used in many industries, including:
    * Waste_water_treatment
    * Refrigeration
    * Wine and beer making
    * Petroleum_refining
    * nuclear_power
In waste water treatment, heat exchangers play a vital role in maintaining
optimal temperatures within anaerobic_digesters to promote the growth of
microbes that remove pollutants. Common types of heat exchangers used in this
application are the double pipe heat exchanger as well as the plate and frame
heat exchanger.
***** In aircraft[edit] *****
In commercial aircraft heat exchangers are used to take heat from the engine's
oil system to heat cold fuel.[39] This improves fuel efficiency, as well as
reduces the possibility of water entrapped in the fuel freezing in components.
[40]
***** Current market and forecast[edit] *****
Estimated at US$42.7 billion in 2012, the global demand of heat exchangers will
experience robust growth of about 7.8% annually over the next years. The market
value is expected to reach US$57.9 billion by 2016 and to approach US$78.16
billion by 2020. Tubular heat exchangers and plate heat exchangers are still
the most widely applied product types.[41]
***** A model of a simple heat exchanger[edit] *****
A simple heat exchange [42][43] might be thought of as two straight pipes with
fluid flow, which are thermally connected. Let the pipes be of equal length L,
carrying fluids with heat_capacity      C  i     {\displaystyle C_{i}}  [C_{i}]
(energy per unit mass per unit change in temperature) and let the mass flow
rate of the fluids through the pipes, both in the same direction, be      j  i
{\displaystyle j_{i}}  [j_i] (mass per unit time), where the subscript i
applies to pipe 1 or pipe 2.
Temperature profiles for the pipes are      T  1   ( x )   {\displaystyle T_{1}
(x)}  [T_{1}(x)] and      T  2   ( x )   {\displaystyle T_{2}(x)}  [T_{2}(x)]
where x is the distance along the pipe. Assume a steady state, so that the
temperature profiles are not functions of time. Assume also that the only
transfer of heat from a small volume of fluid in one pipe is to the fluid
element in the other pipe at the same position, i.e., there is no transfer of
heat along a pipe due to temperature differences in that pipe. By Newton's_law
of_cooling the rate of change in energy of a small volume of fluid is
proportional to the difference in temperatures between it and the corresponding
element in the other pipe:
            d  u  1     d t    = &#x03B3; (  T  2   &#x2212;  T  1   )
      {\displaystyle {\frac {du_{1}}{dt}}=\gamma (T_{2}-T_{1})}  [{\frac  {du_
      {1}}{dt}}=\gamma (T_{2}-T_{1})]
            d  u  2     d t    = &#x03B3; (  T  1   &#x2212;  T  2   )
      {\displaystyle {\frac {du_{2}}{dt}}=\gamma (T_{1}-T_{2})}  [{\frac  {du_
      {2}}{dt}}=\gamma (T_{1}-T_{2})]
( this is for parallel flow in the same direction and opposite temperature
gradients, but for counter-flow heat exchange countercurrent_exchange the sign
is opposite in the second equation in front of     &#x03B3; (  T  1   &#x2212;
T  2   )   {\displaystyle \gamma (T_{1}-T_{2})}  [{\displaystyle \gamma (T_{1}-
T_{2})}] )
, where      u  i   ( x )   {\displaystyle u_{i}(x)}  [u_{i}(x)] is the thermal
energy per unit length and Î³ is the thermal connection constant per unit
length between the two pipes. This change in internal energy results in a
change in the temperature of the fluid element. The time rate of change for the
fluid element being carried along by the flow is:
            d  u  1     d t    =  J  1      d  T  1     d x      {\displaystyle
      {\frac {du_{1}}{dt}}=J_{1}{\frac {dT_{1}}{dx}}}  [{\frac  {du_{1}}
      {dt}}=J_{1}{\frac  {dT_{1}}{dx}}]
            d  u  2     d t    =  J  2      d  T  2     d x      {\displaystyle
      {\frac {du_{2}}{dt}}=J_{2}{\frac {dT_{2}}{dx}}}  [{\frac  {du_{2}}
      {dt}}=J_{2}{\frac  {dT_{2}}{dx}}]
where      J  i   =   C  i      j  i      {\displaystyle J_{i}={C_{i}}{j_{i}}}
[J_{i}={C_{i}}{j_{i}}] is the "thermal mass flow rate". The differential
equations governing the heat exchanger may now be written as:
          J  1      &#x2202;  T  1     &#x2202; x    = &#x03B3; (  T  2
      &#x2212;  T  1   )   {\displaystyle J_{1}{\frac {\partial T_{1}}{\partial
      x}}=\gamma (T_{2}-T_{1})}  [J_{1}{\frac  {\partial T_{1}}{\partial
      x}}=\gamma (T_{2}-T_{1})]
          J  2      &#x2202;  T  2     &#x2202; x    = &#x03B3; (  T  1
      &#x2212;  T  2   ) .   {\displaystyle J_{2}{\frac {\partial T_{2}}
      {\partial x}}=\gamma (T_{1}-T_{2}).}  [J_{2}{\frac  {\partial T_{2}}
      {\partial x}}=\gamma (T_{1}-T_{2}).]
Note that, since the system is in a steady state, there are no partial
derivatives of temperature with respect to time, and since there is no heat
transfer along the pipe, there are no second derivatives in x as is found in
the heat_equation. These two coupled first-order differential_equations may be
solved to yield:
          T  1   = A &#x2212;    B  k  1    k     e  &#x2212; k x
      {\displaystyle T_{1}=A-{\frac {Bk_{1}}{k}}\,e^{-kx}}  [T_{1}=A-{\frac
      {Bk_{1}}{k}}\,e^{{-kx}}]
          T  2   = A +    B  k  2    k     e  &#x2212; k x     {\displaystyle
      T_{2}=A+{\frac {Bk_{2}}{k}}\,e^{-kx}}  [T_{2}=A+{\frac  {Bk_{2}}{k}}\,e^{
      {-kx}}]
where      k  1   = &#x03B3;  /   J  1     {\displaystyle k_{1}=\gamma /J_{1}}
[k_{1}=\gamma /J_{1}],      k  2   = &#x03B3;  /   J  2     {\displaystyle k_
{2}=\gamma /J_{2}}  [k_{2}=\gamma /J_{2}],
         k =  k  1   +  k  2     {\displaystyle k=k_{1}+k_{2}}  [k=k_{1}+k_{2}]
(this is for parallel-flow, but for counter-flow the sign in front of      k  2
{\displaystyle k_{2}}  [k_{2}] is negative, so that if      k  2   =  k  1
{\displaystyle k_{2}=k_{1}}  [{\displaystyle k_{2}=k_{1}}], for the same
"thermal mass flow rate" in both opposite directions, the gradient of
temperature is constant and the temperatures linear in position x with a
constant difference     (  T  2   &#x2212;  T  1   )   {\displaystyle (T_{2}-T_
{1})}  [{\displaystyle (T_{2}-T_{1})}] along the exchanger, explaining why the
counter current design countercurrent_exchange is the most efficient )
and A and B are two as yet undetermined constants of integration. Let      T
10     {\displaystyle T_{10}}  [T_{{10}}] and      T  20     {\displaystyle T_
{20}}  [T_{{20}}] be the temperatures at x=0 and let      T  1 L
{\displaystyle T_{1L}}  [T_{{1L}}] and      T  2 L     {\displaystyle T_{2L}}
[T_{{2L}}] be the temperatures at the end of the pipe at x=L. Define the
average temperatures in each pipe as:
            T &#x00AF;    1   =   1 L    &#x222B;  0   L    T  1   ( x ) d x
      {\displaystyle {\overline {T}}_{1}={\frac {1}{L}}\int _{0}^{L}T_{1}(x)dx}
      [\overline {T}_{1}={\frac  {1}{L}}\int _{0}^{L}T_{1}(x)dx]
            T &#x00AF;    2   =   1 L    &#x222B;  0   L    T  2   ( x ) d x .
      {\displaystyle {\overline {T}}_{2}={\frac {1}{L}}\int _{0}^{L}T_{2}
      (x)dx.}  [\overline {T}_{2}={\frac  {1}{L}}\int _{0}^{L}T_{2}(x)dx.]
Using the solutions above, these temperatures are:
                                                                                  T  20   =

Choosing any two of the temperatures above eliminates the constants of
integration, letting us find the other four temperatures. We find the total
energy transferred by integrating the expressions for the time rate of change
of internal energy per unit length:
            d  U  1     d t    =  &#x222B;  0   L      d  u  1     d t     d x
      =  J  1   (  T  1 L   &#x2212;  T  10   ) = &#x03B3; L (    T &#x00AF;
      2   &#x2212;    T &#x00AF;    1   )   {\displaystyle {\frac {dU_{1}}
      {dt}}=\int _{0}^{L}{\frac {du_{1}}{dt}}\,dx=J_{1}(T_{1L}-T_{10})=\gamma L
      ({\overline {T}}_{2}-{\overline {T}}_{1})}  [{\frac  {dU_{1}}{dt}}=\int _
      {0}^{L}{\frac  {du_{1}}{dt}}\,dx=J_{1}(T_{{1L}}-T_{{10}})=\gamma L
      (\overline {T}_{2}-\overline {T}_{1})]
            d  U  2     d t    =  &#x222B;  0   L      d  u  2     d t     d x
      =  J  2   (  T  2 L   &#x2212;  T  20   ) = &#x03B3; L (    T &#x00AF;
      1   &#x2212;    T &#x00AF;    2   ) .   {\displaystyle {\frac {dU_{2}}
      {dt}}=\int _{0}^{L}{\frac {du_{2}}{dt}}\,dx=J_{2}(T_{2L}-T_{20})=\gamma L
      ({\overline {T}}_{1}-{\overline {T}}_{2}).}  [{\frac  {dU_{2}}{dt}}=\int
      _{0}^{L}{\frac  {du_{2}}{dt}}\,dx=J_{2}(T_{{2L}}-T_{{20}})=\gamma L
      (\overline {T}_{1}-\overline {T}_{2}).]
By the conservation of energy, the sum of the two energies is zero. The
quantity        T &#x00AF;    2   &#x2212;    T &#x00AF;    1
{\displaystyle {\overline {T}}_{2}-{\overline {T}}_{1}}  [\overline {T}_{2}-
\overline {T}_{1}] is known as the Log_mean_temperature_difference, and is a
measure of the effectiveness of the heat exchanger in transferring heat energy.
