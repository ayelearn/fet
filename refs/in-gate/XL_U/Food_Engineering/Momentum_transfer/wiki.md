In particle_physics, wave_mechanics and optics, momentum transfer is the amount
of momentum that one particle gives to another particle.
In the simplest example of scattering of two colliding particles with initial
momenta         p &#x2192;     i 1   ,     p &#x2192;     i 2
{\displaystyle {\vec {p}}_{i1},{\vec {p}}_{i2}}  [{\vec  {p}}_{{i1}},{\vec
{p}}_{{i2}}], resulting in final momenta         p &#x2192;     f 1   ,     p
&#x2192;     f 2     {\displaystyle {\vec {p}}_{f1},{\vec {p}}_{f2}}  [{\vec
{p}}_{{f1}},{\vec  {p}}_{{f2}}], the momentum transfer is given by
            q &#x2192;    =     p &#x2192;     i 1   &#x2212;     p &#x2192;
      f 1   =     p &#x2192;     f 2   &#x2212;     p &#x2192;     i 2
      {\displaystyle {\vec {q}}={\vec {p}}_{i1}-{\vec {p}}_{f1}={\vec {p}}_
      {f2}-{\vec {p}}_{i2}}  [{\vec  q}={\vec  {p}}_{{i1}}-{\vec  {p}}_{{f1}}=
      {\vec  {p}}_{{f2}}-{\vec  {p}}_{{i2}}]
where the last identity expresses momentum_conservation. Momentum transfer is
an important quantity because     &#x0394; x = &#x210F;  /   |  q  |
{\displaystyle \Delta x=\hbar /|q|}  [\Delta x=\hbar /|q|] is a better measure
for the typical distance resolution of the reaction than the momenta
themselves.
***** Wave mechanics and optics[edit] *****
A wave has a momentum     p = &#x210F; k   {\displaystyle p=\hbar k}  [p=\hbar
k] and is a vectorial quantity. The difference of the momentum of the scattered
wave to the incident wave is called momentum transfer. The wave_number k is the
absolute of the wave_vector     k = q  /  &#x210F;   {\displaystyle k=q/\hbar }
[k=q/\hbar ] and is related to the wavelength     k = 2 &#x03C0;  /  &#x03BB;
{\displaystyle k=2\pi /\lambda }  [k=2\pi /\lambda ]. Often, momentum transfer
is given in wavenumber units in reciprocal_length     Q =  k  f   &#x2212;  k
i     {\displaystyle Q=k_{f}-k_{i}}  [Q=k_{f}-k_{i}]
**** Diffraction[edit] ****
The momentum transfer plays an important role in the evaluation of neutron, X-
ray and electron_diffraction for the investigation of condensed_matter. Bragg
diffraction occurs on the atomic crystal_lattice, conserves the wave energy and
thus is called elastic_scattering, where the wave_numbers final and incident
particles,      k  f     {\displaystyle k_{f}}  [k_f] and      k  i
{\displaystyle k_{i}}  [k_{i}], respectively, are equal and just the direction
changes by a reciprocal_lattice vector     G = Q =  k  f   &#x2212;  k  i
{\displaystyle G=Q=k_{f}-k_{i}}  [G=Q=k_{f}-k_{i}] with the relation to the
lattice spacing     G = 2 &#x03C0;  /  d   {\displaystyle G=2\pi /d}  [G=2\pi /
d]. As momentum is conserved, the transfer of momentum occurs to crystal
momentum.
The presentation in     Q   {\displaystyle Q}  [Q]-space is generic and does
not depend on the type of radiation and wavelength used but only on the sample
system, which allows to compare results obtained from many different methods.
Some established communities such as powder_diffraction employ the diffraction
angle     2 &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle 2\theta }  [2\theta ] as the independent
variable, which worked fine in the early years when only a few characteristic
wavelengths such as Cu-K    &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] were
available. The relationship to     Q   {\displaystyle Q}  [Q]-space is
         Q =    4 &#x03C0; sin &#x2061;  ( &#x03B8; )   &#x03BB;
      {\displaystyle Q={\frac {4\pi \sin \left(\theta \right)}{\lambda }}}  [Q=
      {\frac  {4\pi \sin \left(\theta \right)}{\lambda }}]
and basically states that larger     2 &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle 2\theta }
[2\theta ] corresponds to larger     Q   {\displaystyle Q}  [Q].
