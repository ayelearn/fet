****** Sterilization (microbiology) ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Sterilization refers to any process that eliminates, removes, kills, or
deactivates all forms of life and other biological_agents (such as fungi,
bacteria, viruses, spore forms, prions, unicellular eukaryotic organisms such
as Plasmodium, etc.) present in a specified region, such as a surface, a volume
of fluid, medication, or in a compound such as biological culture_media.[1][2]
Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including: heat,
chemicals, irradiation, high_pressure, and filtration. Sterilization is
distinct from disinfection, sanitization, and pasteurization, in that
sterilization kills, deactivates, or eliminates all forms of life and other
biological agents which are present.

***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Foods[edit] ****
One of the first steps toward modernized sterilization was made by Nicolas
Appert who discovered that thorough application of heat over a suitable period
slowed the decay of foods and various liquids, preserving them for safe
consumption for a longer time than was typical. Canning of foods is an
extension of the same principle and has helped to reduce food_borne_illness
("food poisoning"). Other methods of sterilizing foods include food_irradiation
[3] and high pressure (pascalization).[4]
**** Medicine and surgery[edit] ****
Joseph_Lister was a pioneer of antiseptic_surgery.
Apparatus to sterilize surgical instruments, VerwaltungsgebÃ¤ude der Schweiz.
Kranken- und Hilfsanstalt, 1914-1918
In general, surgical instruments and medications that enter an already aseptic
part of the body (such as the bloodstream, or penetrating the skin) must be
sterile. Examples of such instruments include scalpels, hypodermic_needles, and
artificial_pacemakers. This is also essential in the manufacture of parenteral
pharmaceuticals.
Preparation of injectable medications and intravenous solutions for fluid
replacement therapy requires not only sterility but also well-designed
containers to prevent entry of adventitious_agents after initial product
sterilization.
Most medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of
materials that are able to go under steam sterilization. However, since 1950,
there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials
(e.g., plastics) that require low-temperature sterilization. Ethylene_oxide gas
has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices.
Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization
systems (e.g., vaporized_hydrogen_peroxide, peracetic_acid immersion, ozone)
have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices.[5]
Steam sterilization is the most widely used and the most dependable. Steam
sterilization is nontoxic, inexpensive, rapidly microbicidal, sporicidal, and
rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics.[6]
**** Spacecraft[edit] ****
There are strict international rules to protect_the_contamination_of_Solar
System_bodies from biological material from Earth. Standards vary depending on
both the type of mission and its destination; the more likely a planet is
considered to be habitable, the stricter the requirements are.
Many components of instruments used on spacecraft cannot withstand very high
temperatures, so techniques not requiring excessive temperatures are used as
tolerated, including heating to at least 120 Â°C (248 Â°F), chemical
sterilization, oxidization, ultraviolet, and irradiation.[7]
***** Quantification[edit] *****
The aim of sterilization is the reduction of initially present microorganisms
or other potential pathogens. The degree of sterilization is commonly expressed
by multiples of the decimal reduction time, or D-value, denoting the time
needed to reduce the initial number      N  0     {\displaystyle N_{0}}  [N_
{0}] to one tenth (     10  &#x2212; 1     {\displaystyle 10^{-1}}  [10^{-1}])
of its original value.[8] Then the number of microorganisms     N
{\displaystyle N}  [N] after sterilization time     t   {\displaystyle t}  [t]
is given by:
           N  N  0     =  10   (  &#x2212;   t D    )      {\displaystyle
      {\frac {N}{N_{0}}}=10^{\left(-{\frac {t}{D}}\right)}}  [{\displaystyle
      {\frac {N}{N_{0}}}=10^{\left(-{\frac {t}{D}}\right)}}].
The D-value is a function of sterilization conditions and varies with the type
of microorganism, temperature, water_activity, pH etc.. For steam sterilization
(see below) typically the temperature, in degrees Celsius, is given as an
index.
Theoretically, the likelihood of the survival of an individual microorganism is
never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using
the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than
is required to kill the bioburden present on or in the item being sterilized.
This provides a sterility_assurance_level (SAL) equal to the probability of a
non-sterile unit.
For high-risk applications, such as medical devices and injections, a sterility
assurance level of at least 10â6 is required by the United States Food_and
Drug_Administration (FDA).[9]
***** Heat[edit] *****
**** Steam[edit] ****
See also: Moist_heat_sterilization
A widely used method for heat sterilization is the autoclave, sometimes called
a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to 121â134 Â°C
(250â273 Â°F) under pressure. To achieve sterility, the article is placed in
a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a temperature
and time setpoint. Almost all the air is removed from the chamber, because air
is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that
differs from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is
held at the temperature setpoint for a period of time which varies depending on
what bioburden is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance
(D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3
and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat)[10] at 121 Â°C (250 Â°F) at
100 kPa (15 psi), which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of
10â4 for a product with a bioburden of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes.[11]
Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled
slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be
achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing
liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.
Proper autoclave treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial spores in
addition to fungi, bacteria, and viruses, but is not expected to eliminate all
prions, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various
recommendations state 121â132 Â°C (250â270 Â°F) for 60 minutes or 134 Â°C
(273 Â°F) for at least 18 minutes.[citation_needed] The 263K scrapie prion is
inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other
strains of scrapie, and strains of Creutzfeldt-Jakob_disease (CKD) and bovine
spongiform_encephalopathy (BSE) are more resistant. Using mice as test animals,
one experiment showed that heating BSE positive brain tissue at 134â138 Â°C
(273â280 Â°F) for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 log decrease in prion
infectivity.[12]
Most autoclaves have meters and charts that record or display information,
particularly temperature and pressure as a function of time. The information is
checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met.
Indicator_tape is often placed on the packages of products prior to
autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes
color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.[13]
Bioindicators can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance.
Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available, based on microbial
spores. Most contain spores of the heat-resistant microbe Geobacillus
stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus), which is extremely
resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of
glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside
glassine envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is
difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.
For autoclaving, cleaning is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime
may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can be achieved
through physical scrubbing, sonication, ultrasound, or pulsed air.[14]
Pressure_cooking and canning is analogous to autoclaving, and when performed
correctly renders food sterile.
Moist heat causes the destruction of microorganisms by denaturation of
macromolecules, primarily proteins. This method is a faster process than dry
heat sterilization.[15]
**** Dry heat[edit] ****
See also: Dry_heat_sterilization
Dry heat sterilizer
Dry heat was the first method of sterilization and is a longer process than
moist heat sterilization. The destruction of microorganisms through the use of
dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures,
the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air
can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism
and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At
higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms.
This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.[16]
The standard setting for a hot air oven is at least two hours at 160 Â°C
(320 Â°F). A rapid method heats air to 190 Â°C (374 Â°F) for 6 minutes for
unwrapped objects and 12 minutes for wrapped objects.[17][18] Dry heat has the
advantage that it can be used on powders and other heat-stable items that are
adversely affected by steam (e.g. it does not cause rusting of steel objects).
**** Flaming[edit] ****
Flaming is done to inoculation_loops and straight-wires in microbiology labs
for streaking. Leaving the loop in the flame of a Bunsen_burner or alcohol
burner until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated.
This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large
objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating,
infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed,
contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been
developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that
such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is
that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object
is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in a 70% or
more concentrated solution of ethanol, then briefly touch the object to a
Bunsen_burner flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less
residue than a gas flame.
**** Incineration[edit] ****
Incineration is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of
organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any
organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other biohazardous_waste
before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini
furnaces that incinerate and kill off any microorganisms that may be on an
inoculating loop or wire.[19]
**** Tyndallization[edit] ****
Main article: Tyndallization
Named after John_Tyndall, Tyndallization[20] is an obsolete and lengthy process
designed to reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left
by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period
(typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day,
and then repeating the process a total of three to four times. The incubation
periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling
period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage,
which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many
spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for
media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive
substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.
**** Glass bead sterilizers[edit] ****
Glass bead sterilizers work by heating glass beads to 250 Â°C (482 Â°F).
Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object
while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead
sterilizers were once a common sterilization method employed in dental offices
as well as biological laboratories,[21] but are not approved by the U.S._Food
and_Drug_Administration (FDA) and Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention
(CDC) to be used as a sterilizers since 1997.[22] They are still popular in
European and Israeli dental practices, although there are no current evidence-
based guidelines for using this sterilizer.[21]
***** Chemical sterilization[edit] *****
Chemiclav
Chemicals are also used for sterilization. Heating provides a reliable way to
rid objects of all transmissible agents, but it is not always appropriate if it
will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber
optics, electronics, and many plastics. In these situations chemicals, either
in a gaseous or liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas
and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must
ensure that the article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the
sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new
challenges for workplace_safety, as the properties that make chemicals
effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.
**** Ethylene oxide[edit] ****
Ethylene_oxide (EO, EtO) gas treatment is one of the common methods used to
sterilize, pasteurize, or disinfect items because of its wide range of material
compatibility. It is also used to process items that are sensitive to
processing with other methods, such as radiation (gamma, electron beam, X-ray),
heat (moist or dry), or other chemicals. Ethylene oxide treatment is the most
common chemical sterilization method, used for approximately 70% of total
sterilizations, and for over 50% of all disposable medical devices.[23]
Ethylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between 30 and 60 Â°C (86 and
140 Â°F) with relative_humidity above 30% and a gas concentration between 200
and 800 mg/l.[24] Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene
oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all porous_materials, and it can
penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all
known microorganisms, such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi
(including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even
when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic, and carcinogenic; however,
only with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in
compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and
processes require biological validation after sterilizer installation,
significant repairs or process changes.
The traditional process consists of a preconditioning phase (in a separate room
or cell), a processing phase (more commonly in a vacuum vessel and sometimes in
a pressure rated vessel), and an aeration phase (in a separate room or cell) to
remove EO residues and lower by-products such as ethylene_chlorohydrin (EC or
ECH) and, of lesser importance, ethylene_glycol (EG). An alternative process,
known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three
phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel. This latter option
can facilitate faster overall processing time and residue dissipation.
The most common EO processing method is the gas chamber method. To benefit from
economies_of_scale, EO has traditionally been delivered by filling a large
chamber with a combination of gaseous EO either as pure EO, or with other gases
used as diluents; diluents include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and carbon_dioxide.
Ethylene oxide is still widely used by medical device manufacturers. Since EO
is explosive at concentrations above 3%,[25] EO was traditionally supplied with
an inert carrier gas, such as a CFC or HCFC. The use of CFCs or HCFCs as the
carrier gas was banned because of concerns of ozone_depletion.[26] These
halogenated_hydrocarbons are being replaced by systems using 100% EO, because
of regulations and the high cost of the blends. In hospitals, most EO
sterilizers use single-use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of
use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of EO blends.
It is important to adhere to patient and healthcare personnel government
specified limits of EO residues in and/or on processed products, operator
exposure after processing, during storage and handling of EO gas cylinders, and
environmental emissions produced when using EO.
The U.S. Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration (OSHA) has set the
permissible_exposure_limit (PEL) at 1 ppm â calculated as an eight-hour time-
weighted average (TWA) â and 5 ppm as a 15-minute excursion limit (EL). The
National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health's (NIOSH) immediately
dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for EO is 800 ppm.[27] The odor
threshold is around 500 ppm,[28] so EO is imperceptible until concentrations
are well above the OSHA PEL. Therefore, OSHA recommends that continuous gas
monitoring systems be used to protect workers using EO for processing.[29]
**** Nitrogen dioxide[edit] ****
Nitrogen_dioxide (NO2) gas is a rapid and effective sterilant for use against a
wide range of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores.
The unique physical properties of NO2 gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an
enclosed environment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The
mechanism for lethality is the degradation of DNA in the spore core through
nitration of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it
absorbs NO2. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the
gas.[30] NO2 has a boiling point of 21 Â°C (70 Â°F) at sea level, which results
in a relatively highly saturated vapour_pressure at ambient temperature.
Because of this, liquid NO2 may be used as a convenient source for the
sterilant gas. Liquid NO2 is often referred to by the name of its dimer,
dinitrogen_tetroxide (N2O4). Additionally, the low levels of concentration
required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no condensation
occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the
devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle.[31] NO2 is
also less corrosive than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most
medical materials and adhesives.[31]
The most-resistant organism (MRO) to sterilization with NO2 gas is the spore of
Geobacillus_stearothermophilus, which is the same MRO for both steam and
hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of G.
stearothermophilus has been well characterized over the years as a biological
indicator in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of G.
stearothermophilus with NO2 gas proceeds rapidly in a log-linear fashion, as is
typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized
this technology to offer contract sterilization services for medical_devices at
its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility.[32] This has been demonstrated in
Noxilizerâs lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports
from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the
sterilant and residual gases through aeration of the enclosed environment. The
combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter
overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a
lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization
methods.[31]
**** Ozone[edit] ****
Ozone is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a
disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most
organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be
produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings.
Ozone offers many advantages as a sterilant gas; ozone is a very efficient
sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties (E=2.076 vs SHE[33])
capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including prions, without the
need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the
sterilizer from medical-grade oxygen. The high reactivity of ozone means that
waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it
to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage
of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH's
immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for ozone is 5 ppm, 160
times smaller than the 800 ppm IDLH for ethylene oxide. NIOSH[34] and OSHA has
set the PEL for ozone at 0.1 ppm, calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted
average. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their
products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring of exposure
to ozone, in order to provide a rapid warning in the event of a leak. Monitors
for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.
**** Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde[edit] ****
 This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve_this_section by
 adding_citations_to_reliable_sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and
 removed. (August 2017)(Learn_how_and_when_to_remove_this_template_message)
Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde solutions (also used as fixatives) are accepted
liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently
long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 22 hours with
glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid
particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective.
Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time
required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are
volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a
short shelf-life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive
and has a much longer shelf-life if some methanol is added to inhibit
polymerization to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is
also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site
by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the
original Salk_polio_vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.
**** Hydrogen peroxide[edit] ****
Hydrogen_peroxide, in both liquid and as vaporized_hydrogen_peroxide (VHP), is
another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidant,
which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used
to sterilize heat- or temperature-sensitive articles, such as rigid endoscopes.
In medical sterilization, hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations,
ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide
as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene
oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a
cycle time as short as 28 minutes.[35]
Drawbacks of hydrogen peroxide include material compatibility, a lower
capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing
cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products
containing nylon may become brittle.[36] The penetrating ability of hydrogen
peroxide is not as good as ethylene oxide[citation_needed] and so there are
limitations on the length and diameter of the lumen of objects that can be
effectively sterilized. Hydrogen peroxide is a primary irritant and the contact
of the liquid solution with skin will cause bleaching or ulceration depending
on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted
to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (>
10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and
respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has
set the IDLH at 75 ppm,[27] less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide
(800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung
damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0
ppm, calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average.[37] Sterilizer
manufacturers go to great lengths to make their products safe through careful
design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still
workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers documented in the
FDA MAUDE database.[38] When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work
practices should include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for
hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.[39][40]
Vaporized_hydrogen_peroxide (VHP) is used to sterilize large enclosed and
sealed areas, such as entire rooms and aircraft interiors.
Although toxic, VHP breaks down in a short time to water and oxygen.
**** Peracetic acid[edit] ****
Peracetic_acid (0.2%) is a recognized sterilant by the FDA[41] for use in
sterilizing medical devices such as endoscopes.
**** Potential for chemical sterilization of prions[edit] ****
Prions are highly resistant to chemical sterilization. Treatment with
aldehydes, such as formaldehyde, have actually been shown to increase prion
resistance. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) for one hour was shown to be ineffective,
providing less than 3 logs (10â3) reduction in contamination. Iodine,
formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and peracetic acid also fail this test (one hour
treatment). Only chlorine, phenolic_compounds, guanidinium_thiocyanate, and
sodium hydroxide reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too
corrosive to use on certain objects) and sodium hydroxide are the most
consistent. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide.[42]
***** Radiation sterilization[edit] *****
Sterilization can be achieved using electromagnetic_radiation, such as electron
beams, X-rays, gamma_rays, or irradiation by subatomic_particles.[43]
Electromagnetic or particulate radiation can be energetic enough to ionize
atoms or molecules (ionizing_radiation), or less energetic (non-ionizing
radiation).
**** Non-ionizing radiation sterilization[edit] ****
Further information: Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation
Ultraviolet light irradiation (UV, from a germicidal_lamp) is useful for
sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are
transparent to visible_light absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to
sterilize the interiors of biological_safety_cabinets between uses, but is
ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become
polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so that it is very difficult to
remove). It also damages some plastics, such as polystyrene foam if exposed for
prolonged periods of time.
**** Ionizing radiation sterilization[edit] ****
Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam,
X-ray, gamma rays)
The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the United_Nations
International_Atomic_Energy_Agency and monitored by the different national
Nuclear_Regulatory_Commissions (NRC). The radiation exposure accidents that
have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed
to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then
mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.
Gamma_radiation is very penetrating, and is commonly used for sterilization of
disposable medical equipment, such as syringes, needles, cannulas and IV sets,
and food. It is emitted by a radioisotope, usually cobalt-60 (60Co) or caesium-
137 (137Cs), which have photon energies of up to 1.3 and 0.66 MeV,
respectively.
Use of a radioisotope requires shielding for the safety of the operators while
in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a
water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows
maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the
radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated
in the water in hermetically-sealed bells; no further shielding is required for
such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use dry storage, providing movable
shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An
incident in Decatur,_Georgia, US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into
the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention[44] has led to use of this
radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly,
non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma photons have about twice the
energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of caesium-137-produced radiation.
Electron_beam_processing is also commonly used for sterilization. Electron
beams use an on-off technology and provide a much higher dosing rate than gamma
or X-rays. Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is needed and
thereby any potential degradation to polymers is reduced. Because electrons
carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays.
Facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the
environment from radiation exposure.
High-energy_X-rays (produced by bremsstrahlung) allow irradiation of large
packages and pallet loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating
to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose
uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization does not require chemical or radioactive
material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an X-ray
generator that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated
by bombarding a dense material (target) such as tantalum or tungsten with high-
energy electrons, in a process known as bremsstrahlung conversion. These
systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than
other systems for the same result.
Irradiation with X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons does not make materials
radioactive, because the energy used is too low. Generally an energy of at
least 10 MeV is needed to induce_radioactivity in a material.[45] Neutrons and
very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good
penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make
materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.
Sterilization by irradiation with gamma rays may however affect material
properties.[46]
Irradiation is used by the United_States_Postal_Service to sterilize mail in
the Washington,_D.C. area. Some foods (e.g. spices and ground meats) are
sterilized_by_irradiation.[47]
Subatomic particles may be more or less penetrating and may be generated by a
radioisotope or a device, depending upon the type of particle.
***** Sterile filtration[edit] *****
Fluids that would be damaged by heat, irradiation or chemical sterilization,
such as drug products, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane
filters. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and
protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size
0.2 Âµm will usually effectively remove microorganisms.[48] Some staphylococcal
species have, however, been shown to be flexible enough to pass through 0.22
Âµm filters.[49] In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or
inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20â50
nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve
higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be
used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential_flow_filtration (TFF)
and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate
accumulation and blockage.
Membrane filters used in production processes are commonly made from materials
such as mixed cellulose_ester or polyethersulfone (PES). The filtration
equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized
disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user,
generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile
filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane
filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The
nondestructive integrity test assures the filter is undamaged and is a
regulatory requirement.[50] Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile
filtration is performed inside of a cleanroom to prevent contamination.
***** Preservation of sterility[edit] *****
A curette in sterile packaging.
Instruments that have undergone sterilization can be maintained in such
condition by containment in sealed packaging until use.
Aseptic technique is the act of maintaining sterility during procedures.
