Diagram of simple filtration: oversize particles in the feed cannot pass
through the lattice structure of the filter, while fluid and small particles
pass through, becoming filtrate.
Filtration is any of various mechanical, physical or biological operations that
separates solids from fluids (liquids or gases) by adding a medium through
which only the fluid can pass. The fluid that passes through is called the
filtrate.[1] In physical filters oversize solids in the fluid are retained and
in biological filters particulates are trapped and ingested and metabolites are
retained and removed. However, the separation is not complete; solids will be
contaminated with some fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles
(depending on the pore size, filter thickness and biological activity).
Filtration occurs both in nature and in engineered systems; there are
biological, geological, and industrial forms. For example, in animals
(including humans), renal_filtration removes waste from the blood, and in water
treatment and sewage_treatment, undesirable constituents are removed by people
into a animal film grown on or in the filter medium, as in slow_sand
filtration.

***** Applications[edit] *****
    * Filtration is used to separate particles and fluid in a suspension, where
      the fluid can be a liquid, a gas or a supercritical_fluid. Depending on
      the application, either one or both of the components may be isolated.
    * Filtration, as a physical operation is very important in chemistry for
      the separation of materials of different chemical composition. A solvent
      is chosen which dissolves one component, while not dissolving the other.
      By dissolving the mixture in the chosen solvent, one component will go
      into the solution and pass through the filter, while the other will be
      retained. This is one of the most important techniques used by chemists
      to purify compounds.
    * Filtration is also important and widely used as one of the unit
      operations of chemical_engineering. It may be simultaneously combined
      with other unit operations to process the feed stream, as in the
      biofilter, which is a combined filter and biological digestion device.
    * Filtration differs from sieving, where separation occurs at a single
      perforated layer (a sieve). In sieving, particles that are too big to
      pass through the holes of the sieve are retained (see particle_size
      distribution). In filtration, a multilayer lattice retains those
      particles that are unable to follow the tortuous channels of the filter.
      [2] Oversize particles may form a cake layer on top of the filter and may
      also block the filter lattice, preventing the fluid phase from crossing
      the filter (blinding). Commercially, the term filter is applied to
      membranes where the separation lattice is so thin that the surface
      becomes the main zone of particle separation, even though these products
      might be described as sieves.
    * Filtration differs from adsorption, where it is not the physical size of
      particles that causes separation but the effects of surface_charge. Some
      adsorption devices containing activated_charcoal and ion_exchange_resin
      are commercially called filters, although filtration is not their
      principal function.
    * Filtration differs from removal of magnetic contaminants from fluids with
      magnets (typically lubrication oil, coolants and fuel_oils), because
      there is no filter medium. Commercial devices called âmagnetic
      filtersâ are sold, but the name reflects their use, not their mode of
      operation.
***** Methods[edit] *****
There are many different methods of filtration; all aim to attain the
separation of substances. Separation is achieved by some form of interaction
between the substance or objects to be removed and the filter. The substance
that is to pass through the filter must be a fluid, i.e. a liquid or gas.
Methods of filtration vary depending on the location of the targeted material,
i.e. whether it is dissolved in the fluid phase or suspended as a solid.
Hot Filtration, solution contained in the Erlenmeyer flask is heated on a hot
plate in order to prevent re-crystallization of solids in the flask itself
There are several filtration techniques depending on the desired outcome
namely, hot, cold and vacuum_filtration. Some of the major purposes of getting
the desired outcome are, for the removal of impurities from a mixture or, for
the isolation of solids from a mixture.
Hot Filtration for the separation of solids from a hot solution
Hot filtration method is mainly used to separate solids from a hot solution.
This is done in order to prevent crystal formation in the filter funnel and
other apparatuses that comes in contact with the solution. As a result, the
apparatus and the solution used are heated in order to prevent the rapid
decrease in temperature which in turn, would lead to the crystallization of the
solids in the funnel and hinder the filtration process.[3] One of the most
important measures to prevent the formation of crystals in the funnel and to
undergo effective hot filtration is the use stemless filter funnel. Due to the
absence of stem in the filter funnel, there is a decrease in the surface area
of contact between the solution and the stem of the filter funnel, hence
preventing re-crystallization of solid in the funnel, adversely affecting
filtration process.
Cold Filtration, the ice bath is used to cool down the temperature of the
solution before undergoing the filtration process
Cold Filtration method is the use of ice bath in order to rapidly cool down the
solution to be crystallized rather than leaving it out to cool it down slowly
in the room temperature. This technique results to the formation of very small
crystals as opposed to getting large crystals by cooling the solution down at
room temperature.
Vacuum_Filtration technique is most preferred for small batch of solution in
order to quickly dry out small crystals. This method requires a BÃ¼chner
funnel, filter paper of smaller diameter than the funnel, BÃ¼chner_flask, and
rubber tubing to connect to vacuum source.
***** Filter media[edit] *****
Two main types of filter media are employed in laboratories: a surface filter,
a solid sieve which traps the solid particles, with or without the aid of
filter_paper (e.g. BÃ¼chner_funnel, Belt_filter, Rotary_vacuum-drum_filter,
Cross-flow_filters, Screen_filter); and a depth_filter, a bed of granular
material which retains the solid particles as it passes (e.g. sand_filter). The
first type allows the solid particles, i.e. the residue, to be collected
intact; the second type does not permit this. However, the second type is less
prone to clogging due to the greater surface area where the particles can be
trapped. Also, when the solid particles are very fine, it is often cheaper and
easier to discard the contaminated granules than to clean the solid sieve.
Filter media can be cleaned by rinsing with solvents or detergents.
Alternatively, in engineering applications, such as swimming_pool water
treatment plants, they may be cleaned by backwashing. Self-cleaning screen
filters utilize point-of-suction backwashing to clean the screen without
interrupting system flow.
**** Achieving flow through the filter[edit] ****
Fluids flow through a filter due to a difference in pressureâfluid flows from
the high-pressure side to the low-pressure side of the filter, leaving some
material behind. The simplest method to achieve this is by gravity and can be
seen in the coffeemaker example. In the laboratory, pressure in the form of
compressed air on the feed side (or vacuum on the filtrate side) may be applied
to make the filtration process faster, though this may lead to clogging or the
passage of fine particles. Alternatively, the liquid may flow through the
filter by the force exerted by a pump, a method commonly used in industry when
a reduced filtration time is important. In this case, the filter need not be
mounted vertically.
**** Filter aid[edit] ****
Certain filter aids may be used to aid filtration. These are often
incompressible diatomaceous_earth, or kieselguhr, which is composed primarily
of silica. Also used are wood cellulose and other inert porous solids such as
the cheaper and safer perlite.
These filter aids can be used in two different ways. They can be used as a
precoat before the slurry is filtered. This will prevent gelatinous-type solids
from plugging the filter medium and also give a clearer filtrate. They can also
be added to the slurry before filtration. This increases the porosity of the
cake and reduces resistance of the cake during filtration. In a rotary filter,
the filter aid may be applied as a precoat; subsequently, thin slices of this
layer are sliced off with the cake.
The use of filter aids is usually limited to cases where the cake is discarded
or where the precipitate can be chemically separated from the filter.
***** Alternatives[edit] *****
Filtration is a more efficient method for the separation_of_mixtures than
decantation, but is much more time consuming. If very small amounts of solution
are involved, most of the solution may be soaked up by the filter medium.
An alternative to filtration is centrifugationâinstead of filtering the
mixture of solid and liquid particles, the mixture is centrifuged to force the
(usually) denser solid to the bottom, where it often forms a firm cake. The
liquid above can then be decanted. This method is especially useful for
separating solids which do not filter well, such as gelatinous or fine
particles. These solids can clog or pass through the filter, respectively.
***** Examples[edit] *****
Filter flask (suction flask, with sintered glass filter containing sample).
Note the almost colourless filtrate in the receiver flask.
Examples of filtration include
    * The coffee_filter to keep the coffee separate from the grounds.
    * HEPA filters in air_conditioning to remove particles from air.
    * Belt_filters to extract precious_metals in mining.
    * Horizontal plate filter, also known as Sparkler filter.
    * Furnaces use filtration to prevent the furnace elements from fouling with
      particulates.
    * Pneumatic conveying systems often employ filtration to stop or slow the
      flow of material that is transported, through the use of a baghouse.
    * In the laboratory, a BÃ¼chner_funnel is often used, with a filter_paper
      serving as the porous barrier.
    * Air filters are commonly used to remove airborne particulate matter in
      building ventilation systems, combustion engines, and industrial
      processes.
    * Oil_filter in automobiles, often as a canister or cartridge.
    * Aquarium_filter
An experiment to prove the existence of microscopic_organisms involves the
comparison of water passed through unglazed porcelain and unfiltered water.
When left in sealed containers the filtered water takes longer to go foul,
demonstrating that very small items (such as bacteria) can be removed from
fluids by filtration.
In the kidney, renal_filtration is the filtration of blood in the glomerulus,
followed by selective reabsorption of many substances essential for the body to
maintain homeostasis.
