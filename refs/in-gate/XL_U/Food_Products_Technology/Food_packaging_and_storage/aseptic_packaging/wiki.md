Aseptic processing is a processing technique wherein commercially thermally
sterilized liquid products (typically food or pharmaceutical) are packaged into
previously sterilized containers under sterile conditions to produce shelf-
stable products that do not need refrigeration.[1] Aseptic processing has
almost completely replaced in-container sterilization of liquid foods,
including milk, fruit juices and concentrates, cream, yogurt, salad_dressing,
liquid_egg, and ice cream mix. There has been an increasing popularity for
foods that contain small discrete particles, such as cottage_cheese, baby
foods, tomato products, fruit and vegetables, soups, and rice desserts.[1]
Aseptic processing involves three primary steps: thermal_sterilization of the
product, sterilization of the packaging material, and conservation of sterility
during packaging.[2] To ensure commercial sterility, aseptic processing
facilities are required to maintain proper documentation of production
operations, showing that commercially sterile conditions were achieved and
maintained in all areas of the facility.[3] Any breach of a scheduled process
for the processing or packaging system means that the affected product must be
destroyed, reprocessed or segregated and held for further evaluation.[3] In
addition, the processing and packaging system must be cleaned and re-sterilized
before processing and/or packaging operations can resume. Packaging equipment
and packaging materials are sterilized with various medium or combination of
mediums (i.e., saturated steam, superheated steam, hydrogen_peroxide and heat
and other treatments).[3]

***** Historical development in foods[edit] *****
Aseptic processing was derived from Olin_Ball's heat-cool-fill (HCF) machine
that was developed in 1927.[4] While HCF was successful in improving the
sensory quality of the processed chocolate_milk as compared to canned product,
the use of the equipment was hindered by its cost, maintenance, and
inflexibility to process various container sizes, rendering the machine a
failure.[5]
In the 1940s, the Avoset process was developed by George Grindrod. Food
products processed using the Avoset process were packaged under ultraviolet
lamps and sterilized air inside a positive-pressurized room to keep the
contaminants out of the processing room. sterilization was achieved through the
use of direct steam injection of 126â137 Â°C (260â280 Â°F) and then cooled.
The food treated using this technique was described as an "excellent cream
product" and 75â100 containers were produced each minute.[5]
Later in the 1940s, the Dole Aseptic Process was developed by McKinley Martin.
[4] The foods processed ranged from soups to specialty sauces, fruits, and
dairy products.[5] This process involved four steps:[4][5]
   1. Sterilization of product by heating and immediate cooling
   2. Sterilization of containers and lids using steam
   3. Filling of cooled products aseptically into previously sterilized
      containers
   4. Sealing of lids at an atmosphere of saturated or super heated steam
The Dole aseptic machine overcame the hindrances that caused HCF's failure,
since it was able to process various container sizes, needed less maintenance
time, and cost less. The quality of products processed was consistent
regardless of its container size, an important characteristic for heat
sensitive foods, due to its short processing time. Split_pea_soup was treated
using the Dole aseptic machine at the following dosage: heat time of
140â146 Â°C (280â290 Â°F) for 3.53 seconds, hold time of 8.8 seconds, and
cooling to 32 Â°C (90 Â°F) in 14.0 â 17.0 seconds, compared to the normal
processing time of 40â70 minutes at 115â121 Â°C (240â250 Â°F). The lack
of consumer interest drove foods that were processed in the Dole aseptic
machine to be discontinued.[5]
Erik Wallenberg inventor of Tetra Pak first package.
Roy Graves began sterilizing milk in the 1940s. The milk that was drawn from
the cow went through a pipeline, into a vacuum tank, which was then heated to
285 Â°F, then cooled to room temperature. The product, packaged in metal cans,
was widely accepted by consumers without access to fresh milk, including the
U.S._military.[6]
In 1959, the food_industry saw the advent of the use of paper-foil-plastic
laminated containers called tetrahedron. In 1962, a Swedish company, Tetra_Pak,
introduced this container to the United States market. They sold pasteurized
milk and beverages in the containers. Roy Graves' company started sterilizing
this container with chlorine and were able to aseptically fill and hermetically
seal the container. The use of these containers was not accepted by the
American consumers due to their difficulty in opening however, it was widely
used by the U.S._Navy.[6]
In 1981, hydrogen_peroxide was approved by the FDA to be used to sterilize
containers.[4]
Today, ships used for continental food transport are equipped with aseptic
tanks to transport fruit juices. Another means of transporting aseptically
processed food is the use of aseptic bags.[4]
***** Processing[edit] *****
Aseptic processing allows for the food to be properly sterilized outside the
container and then placed into a previously sterilized container, which is then
sealed in a sterile environment.[1] Most systems use ultra-high_temperature
(UHT) sterilization to sterilize the food product before it is packaged. UHT
sterilizes food at high temperatures usually above 135 C for 1â2 seconds.
This is advantageous because it allows for faster processing, usually a few
seconds at high temperatures (130â150 Â°C) and better retention of sensory
and nutritional characteristics.[1] Aseptic products have a non-refrigerated
shelf-life of a few months to several years.
Sterilization of aseptic packaging material is a crucial step in aseptic food
processing. These containers are sterilized to kill microorganisms present on
the container during forming and transport and prior to filling.[7] There are
numerous methods used to sterile the containers, the most commonly used methods
include: heat, hot water, chemical sterilants (hydrogen_peroxide or peracetic
acid), and radiation or a combination of methods.[6][7]
Aseptically processed food products can be sterilized using either direct or
indirect methods of heat transfer. Direct_heat_transfer can be achieved through
steam_injection and steam_infusion. Food products processed with a steam
injector go through an injection chamber, where steam (150 Â°C) is injected
into the product, then the product is flash cooled to 70 Â°C. Direct heat
transfer is suitable for heat-sensitive foods such as milk. However, only low
viscosity liquids can be processed using steam injection, and high-quality
steam is required to ensure sterilization.[1] Steam infused food products
involves food free-falling into highly pressurized steam which heats the food
to approximately 145 Â°C and then its flash cooled to 65â70 Â°C. Steam
infusion provides processors with great control compared to steam injection and
reduction of burn-on and overheating risks are reduced. It can process higher
viscosity foods compared to steam injection, but risks the blockage of nozzles
in machinery.[1] Indirect forms of heat transfer include: plate heat
exchangers, tubular heat exchangers, or scraped-surface heat exchangers.[6]
Plate_heat_exchangers are mostly used because they are inexpensive and allow
for easy changes during production.Tubular and scraped-surface can heat viscous
food with particulates or high pulp content with minimal damage.[1]
**** Equipment and systems[edit] ****
Equipment used in aseptic processing of food and beverages must be sterilized
before processing and remain sterile during processing.[1] When designing
aseptic processing equipment there are six basic requirements to consider: the
equipment must have the capability of being cleaned thoroughly, it must be able
to be sterilized with steam, chemicals, or high-temperature water,
sterilization media should be able to contact all surfaces of the equipment,
meaning the equipment does not contain any cracks, crevices or dead spots, the
equipment must be able to be kept in a sterile state, it must have the ability
to be used continuously, and lastly, the equipment must comply with
regulations.[6]
Aseptic packaging are generally placed in the following categories:[8] fill,
erect, form, thermoform, blow_mold, and bulk packaging and storage systems.[2]
   1. Fill and seal. The containers are filled and sealed in a sterile
      environment to avoid contamination.
   2. Erect,_fill_and_seal. A plastic container is erected then sterilized,
      filled and sealed.
   3. Form, fill and seal. In this system, a roll of film is first sterilized.
      After sterilization it is formed into the desired shape, filled and
      sealed.
   4. Thermoform, fill and seal. A roll of film is heated and thermoform on a
      sterile surface or environment. It is then filled and seal, also in a
      sterile environment.
   5. Blow mold, fill and seal. The process requires an extrudable material to
      be first blow-molded into a sterile package before filling and sealing.
      This process is usually used to produce bottle products like juices and
      sodas.
   6. Bulk packaging and storage systems. Packaging used for bulk storage
      (drums, totes, bags, etc.) are sterilized using either heat or
      disinfectants. After sterilization they are able to be filled and sealed.
***** Packaging material[edit] *****
Aseptic packaging consists of filling and sealing a sterilized packaging
material with a sterilized product. Aseptic packaging material not only has to
assure sterile conditions within the package and protect the product from
physical damage, but also maintain the quality of the product inside the
packaging.[7] To achieve this, a laminate material is formed from the following
components: semi-rigid paper, aluminum, and plastic.[2] Paper (70%) provides
the stiffness, strength, and the efficient brick shape to the package. Low-
density_polyethylene (24%), the most common plastic used for aseptic packaging,
located on the innermost layer forms the seals that make the package liquid-
tight. Aluminum (6%) is located on the inside of the aseptic package, forming a
barrier against light and oxygen, thereby eliminating the need for
refrigeration and preventing spoilage without using preservatives.[9] Most
packaging material used in aseptic packaging is made from plastics instead of
metal or glass_containers due to the relatively low cost of producing plastic
material when compared to metal and glass. Plastics are lighter than metal or
glass making them cheaper and easier to transport. Plastics also required much
less energy to produce than metal and glass.[2] These factors have made plastic
the packaging material of choice for use in aseptic processing.

**** Selection of aseptic containers[edit] ****
There are a lot of factors that can influence the type of aseptic container
chosen for a product. The following factors may influence the choice of
packaging material for aseptically processed products: functional properties of
the plastic polymer (gas and water vapor barrier properties, chemical
inertness, and flavor and odor absorption or scalping), potential interactions
between plastic polymer and food product, desired shelf life, economical costs,
mechanical characteristics of the packaging material (molding properties,
material handling characteristics, and compatibility with packaging and
sterilization methods), shipping and handling conditions (toughness,
compression), compliance with regulation, and targeted consumer group.[10]
There are a range of different types of containers to choose from depending on
the product. The table below offers a few container types and examples.[2]
                      Selection of aseptic containers[2]
Container Type              Examples                  Container Characteristics
Rigid containers            Metal cans, totes, glass
                            bottles, and jars

Flexible plastic containers Pouches, sachets, etc.
***** Effects on food quality[edit] *****
Aseptic processing preserves food_quality through fast heat treatment followed
by a short holding time and rapid cooling.[1] Compared to canning where food
products are subjected to high temperature processing, the fast heat treatment
provided by aseptic processing enables heat-sensitive characteristics of the
food to be better retained.[1]
**** Flavor[edit] ****
The flavor of aseptically processed food products is minimally changed.[1]
Dairy products could have a cooked flavor because of exposure to sulfhydryl
groups. The flavor is reduced during storage as the sulfhydryl groups oxidize.
Severely treated milk could have a bitter_flavor because of proteolysis.[1]
**** Color[edit] ****
Dairy products could have changes in color, an effect caused by Maillard
browning. This depends on the amount of reducing sugar, the formation of
pyralysins and melanoidins, the severity of the treatment, and the storage
temperature.[1]
Plant pigments, carotene and betanin, are not affected, while chlorophyll and
anthocyanins are minimally reduced.[1]
**** Texture[edit] ****
Meat is less likely to toughen when aseptically processed, compared to canned
products.[1]
Fruit juice viscosity is unaffected. Processed sliced fruit and vegetable
pieces are softer compared to unprocessed pieces as a result of the
solubilization of pectic materials and loss of cell turgor.[1]
**** Nutritional value[edit] ****
Aseptic Processing achieves sterility through a flash-heating process with
temperatures ranging from 91 Â°C to 146 Â°C and is minimally processed. Due to
the significantly lower processing time and temperature range used in aseptic
processing compared to conventional sterilization, such as canning, products
that are aseptically processed are able to retain more nutrients.[11]
Riboflavin, pantothenic_acid, biotin, niacin, and vitamin_B6 are unaffected.
Approximately 10% of thiamine and vitamin_B12, approximately 15% of folic_acid
and pyridoxine, and approximately 25% of vitamin_C are lost during aseptic
processing.[1]
***** Advantages and limitations[edit] *****
**** Advantages[edit] ****
Foods that are processed aseptically have better nutritional, vitamin, and
natural pigment retention (chlorophyll, anthocyanins, betalins, carotenoids)
compared to canned food products because of the lower temperature the foods are
subjected to upon processing.[1] Aseptic processing provides flexibility in
using various container sizes as well as possibility of addition of bioactive
and heat-sensitive components after processing (probiotics, omega-3_fatty
acids, conjugated linoleic_acids).[1]
**** Limitations[edit] ****
Aseptic processing costs more than canning because sterilization of the
packaging materials requires different machinery and can get complex.[1] In
addition, maintaining air sterility in the processing room is difficult.[1]
***** FDA inspection and regulation for aseptic processing[edit] *****
              The examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with
              the United States and do not represent a worldwide_view of the
[Globe icon.] subject. You may improve_this_section, discuss the issue on the
              talk_page, or create_a_new_article, as appropriate. (September

Inspections of aseptic processing is one of the most complex inspection of food
manufacturing operations. Process authorities are required to establish a
process that ensures commercial sterility for the following:
   1. The product
   2. All equipment including the hold tube and any equipment downstream from
      the holding tube such as the filler
   3. The packaging equipment
   4. The packaging material.
Documentation of production operations must be maintained by the facility,
showing an achievement of commercial sterile conditions in all areas of the
facility.[3]
The general regulatory requirements for all U.S_Food_and_Drug_Administration
(FDA) regulated foods are found in section 21 of the U.S._Code_of_Federal
Regulations (CFR) Part 110. Section 113.40 lists specific requirements for
aseptic processing and packaging systems, including specifications for
equipment and instrumentation. One requirement of the FDA regulations is that
all thermal processing operations must be conducted under the operating
supervision of an individual who has completed an FDA-approved course of
instruction on control of thermal processing systems, container closures, and
acidification procedures. The Better_Process_Control_School provides a section
on aseptic processing and packaging systems, and will meet the FDA requirement
for supervisors of aseptic operations.[12]
Processing authorities are responsible for aseptic systems must be aware of
certain factors unique to aseptic processing and packaging operations,
therefore specific knowledge in this area is essential. Neither the FDA nor
other regulatory agency maintains a list of recognized processing authorities,
however, certain organizations are widely recognized within government agencies
and the industry as having the experience and expertise. The FDA regulations
rely upon aseptic processing and packaging authorities to establish parameters
for sterilization of product, packages, and equipment so that commercial
sterility of the end product is assured.[12]
The forms presently used to file aseptic processes for low-acid foods with the
FDA is Form 2541c. Processes for acidified foods that are aseptically processes
and packaged are filed under 2541a. Additionally, processing plants must be
registered with the FDA using Form 2541. The FDA has also developed a Low-acid
Canned Food (LACF) Electronic Process Filling System that facilitates the
completion and submission of the forms.[12]
The FDA does exert authority over the types of aseptic processing and packaging
systems that can be utilized to produce foods for distribution in U.S. commerce
by reviewing and either accepting or rejecting process filing forms from
individual processing firms. The FDA may request sufficient technical
information from the processor to evaluate adequacy of the equipment and the
procedures used to produce a commercially sterile product. Until the FDA finds
no further objections to a process filing, the company is prevented from
distributing product produced on that system in interstate commerce.[12]
Final aseptic products must undergo an incubation test before the product is
released into distribution. The firm must determine the time and temperature of
incubation as well as how many containers are incubated.[12] It is generally
accepted to incubate at 20â25 Â°C for a minimum of 7 days followed
immediately, or after a first reading, by incubation at 30â35 Â°C for a total
minimum incubation time of 14 days. Other incubation schedules should be based
on supporting validation data. It is important to note that prior to
incubation, the containers with the microbial growth medium must be inverted to
ensure all surfaces are thoroughly wetted by the medium.[13]
The FDA relies on periodic inspections of processing plants to monitor
compliance with its regulatory requirements. Inspection frequency for an
individual plant may vary significantly depending upon products packed,
occurrence of potential hazardous processing problems at the plant, and
availability of FDA inspection personnel.[12]
