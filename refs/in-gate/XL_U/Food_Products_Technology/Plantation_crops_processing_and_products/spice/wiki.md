A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used
for flavoring, coloring or preserving food. Spices are distinguished from
herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems of plants used for flavoring or
as a garnish. Many spices have antimicrobial properties[citation_needed]. This
may explain why spices are more commonly used in warmer climates, which have
more infectious_diseases, and why the use of spices is prominent in meat, which
is particularly susceptible to spoiling.[1] Spices are sometimes used in
medicine, religious_rituals, cosmetics or perfume production.[example_needed]

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: Spice_trade
**** Early history[edit] ****
The spice trade developed throughout the Indian_subcontinent[2] and Middle_East
by at earliest 2000 BCE with cinnamon and black_pepper, and in East_Asia with
herbs and pepper. The Egyptians used herbs for mummification and their demand
for exotic spices and herbs helped stimulate world trade. The word spice comes
from the Old French word espice, which became epice, and which came from the
Latin root spec, the noun referring to "appearance, sort, kind": species has
the same root. By 1000 BCE, medical systems based upon herbs could be found in
China, Korea, and India. Early uses were connected with magic, medicine,
religion, tradition, and preservation.[3]
Cloves were used in Mesopotamia by 1700 BCE.[note_1] The ancient Indian epic
Ramayana mentions cloves. The Romans had cloves in the 1st century CE, as Pliny
the_Elder wrote about them.[5]
The earliest written records of spices come from ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and
Indian cultures. The Ebers Papyrus from Early Egyptians that dates from 1550
B.C.E. describes some eight hundred different medicinal remedies and numerous
medicinal procedures.[6]
Historians believe that nutmeg, which originates from the Banda_Islands in
Southeast_Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 6th century BCE.[7]
Indonesian merchants traveled around China, India, the Middle East, and the
east coast of Africa. Arab merchants facilitated the routes through the Middle
East and India. This resulted in the Egyptian port_city of Alexandria being the
main trading center for spices. The most important discovery prior to the
European spice trade were the monsoon winds (40 CE). Sailing from Eastern spice
cultivators to Western European consumers gradually replaced the land-locked
spice routes once facilitated by the Middle East Arab caravans.[3]
In the story of Genesis, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers to spice
merchants. In the biblical poem Song_of_Solomon, the male speaker compares his
beloved to many forms of spices.
**** Middle Ages[edit] ****

Travels_of_Marco_Polo.
Spices were among the most demanded and expensive products available in Europe
in the Middle_Ages,[5] the most common being black_pepper, cinnamon (and the
cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. Given medieval
medicine's main theory of humorism, spices and herbs were indispensable to
balance "humors" in food,[6] a daily basis for good health at a time of
recurrent pandemics. In addition to being desired by those using medieval
medicine, the European elite also craved spices in the Middle_Ages. An example
of the European aristocracy's demand for spice comes from the King_of_Aragon,
who invested substantial resources into bringing back spices to Spain in the
12th century. He was specifically looking for spices to put in wine, and was
not alone among European_monarchs at the time to have such a desire for spice.
[8]
Spices were all imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them
expensive. From the 8th until the 15th century, the Republic_of_Venice had the
monopoly on spice trade with the Middle East, and along with it the neighboring
Italian maritime_republics and city-states. The trade made the region rich. It
has been estimated that around 1,000Â tons of pepper and 1,000Â tons of the other
common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the Late
Middle_Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of
grain for 1.5 million people.[9] The most exclusive was saffron, used as much
for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor. Spices that have now fallen
into obscurity in European cuisine include grains_of_paradise, a relative of
cardamom which mostly replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking,
long_pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb.
**** Early Modern Period[edit] ****
Spain and Portugal were interested in seeking new routes to trade in spices and
other valuable products from Asia. The control of trade routes and the spice-
producing regions were the main reasons that Portuguese navigator Vasco_da_Gama
sailed to India in 1499.[8] When Gama discovered the pepper market in India, he
was able to secure peppers for a much cheaper price than the ones demanded by
Venice.[8] At around the same time, Christopher_Columbus returned from the New
World. He described to investors new spices available there.[citation_needed]
Another source of competition in the spice trade during the 15th and 16th
century was the Ragusans from the maritime republic of Dubrovnik in southern
Croatia.[10]
The military prowess of Afonso_de_Albuquerque (1453Ã¢Â€Â“1515) allowed the
Portuguese to take control of the sea routes to India. In 1506, he took the
island of Socotra in the mouth of the Red_Sea and, in 1507, Ormuz in the
Persian_Gulf. Since becoming the viceroy of the Indies, he took Goa in India in
1510, and Malacca on the Malay_peninsula in 1511. The Portuguese could now
trade directly with Siam, China, and the Maluku_Islands.
With the discovery of the New World came new spices, including allspice, chili
peppers, vanilla, and chocolate. This development kept the spice trade, with
America as a late comer with its new seasonings, profitable well into the 19th
century.[citation_needed]

***** Handling spices[edit] *****
A typical home's kitchen shelf of spices in the United_States or Canada.
A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground
dried. Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be ground into a powder for
convenience. A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life, so it can be
purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving
basis. A fresh spice, such as ginger, is usually more flavorful than its dried
form, but fresh spices are more expensive and have a much shorter shelf life.
Some spices are not always available either fresh or whole, for example
turmeric, and often must be purchased in ground form. Small seeds, such as
fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form.
Pepper mill
To grind a whole spice, the classic tool is mortar_and_pestle. Less labor-
intensive tools are more common now: a microplane or fine grater can be used to
grind small amounts; a coffee_grinder[note_2] is useful for larger amounts. A
frequently used spice such as black pepper may merit storage in its own hand
grinder or mill.
The flavor of a spice is derived in part from compounds (volatile oils) that
oxidize or evaporate when exposed to air. Grinding a spice greatly increases
its surface area and so increases the rates of oxidation and evaporation. Thus,
flavor is maximized by storing a spice whole and grinding when needed. The
shelf life of a whole dry spice is roughly two years; of a ground spice roughly
six months.[11] The "flavor life" of a ground spice can be much shorter.[note
3] Ground spices are better stored away from light.[note_4]
Some flavor elements in spices are soluble in water; many are soluble in oil or
fat. As a general rule, the flavors from a spice take time to infuse into the
food so spices are added early in preparation. This contrasts to herbs which
are usually added late in preparation.[11]
**** Salmonella contamination[edit] ****
A study by the Food_and_Drug_Administration of shipments of spices to the
United States during fiscal years 2007-2009 showed about 7% of the shipments
were contaminated by Salmonella bacteria, some of it antibiotic-resistant.[12]
As most spices are cooked before being served salmonella contamination often
has no effect, but some spices, particularly pepper, are often eaten raw and
present at table for convenient use. Shipments from Mexico and India, a major
producer, were the most frequently contaminated.[13] However, with newly
developed radiation sterilization methods, the risk of Salmonella contamination
is now lower.[14]
***** Nutrition[edit] *****
Because they tend to have strong flavors and are used in small quantities,
spices tend to add few calories to food, even though many spices, especially
those made from seeds, contain high portions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate
by weight. However, when used in larger quantity, spices can also contribute a
substantial amount of minerals and other micronutrients, including iron,
magnesium, calcium, and many others, to the diet. For example, a teaspoon of
paprika contains about 1133 IU of Vitamin_A, which is over 20% of the
recommended daily allowance specified by the US FDA.[15]
Most herbs and spices have substantial antioxidant activity, owing primarily to
phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, which influence nutrition through
many pathways, including affecting the absorption of other nutrients. One study
found cumin and fresh ginger to be highest in antioxidant activity.[16] These
antioxidants can also act as natural preservatives, preventing or slowing the
spoilage of food, leading to a higher nutritional content in stored food.
***** Production[edit] *****
India contributes 75% of global spice production.

***** Standardization[edit] *****
The International_Organization_for_Standardization addresses spices and
condiments, along with related food additives, as part of the International
Classification_for_Standards 67.220 series.[18]
***** Research[edit] *****
The Indian_Institute_of_Spices_Research in Kozhikode, Kerala, is devoted
exclusively to conducting research for ten spice crops: black pepper, cardamom,
cinnamon, clove, garcinia, ginger, nutmeg, paprika, turmeric, and vanilla.

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ A team of archaeologists led by Giorgio_Buccellati excavating the ruins
      of a burned-down house at the site of Terqa, in modern-day Syria, found a
      ceramic pot containing a handful of cloves. The house had burned down
      around 1720 BC and this was the first evidence of cloves being used in
      the west before Roman times.[4]
   2. ^ Other types of coffee grinders, such as a burr_mill, can grind spices
      just as well as coffee beans.
   3. ^ Nutmeg, in particular, suffers from grinding and the flavor will
      degrade noticeably in a matter of days.
   4. ^ Light contributes to oxidation processes.
