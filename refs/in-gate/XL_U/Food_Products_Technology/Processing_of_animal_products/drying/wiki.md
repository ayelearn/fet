Removal of water or another solvent by evaporation from a solid, semi-solid or
liquid
Drying is a mass_transfer process consisting of the removal of water or another
solvent[1] by evaporation from a solid, semi-solid or liquid. This process is
often used as a final production step before selling or packaging products. To
be considered "dried", the final product must be solid, in the form of a
continuous sheet (e.g., paper), long pieces (e.g., wood), particles (e.g.,
cereal grains or corn flakes) or powder (e.g., sand, salt, washing powder, milk
powder). A source of heat and an agent to remove the vapor produced by the
process are often involved. In bioproducts like food, grains, and
pharmaceuticals like vaccines, the solvent to be removed is almost invariably
water. Desiccation may be synonymous with drying or considered an extreme form
of drying.
In the most common case, a gas stream, e.g., air, applies the heat by
convection and carries away the vapor as humidity. Other possibilities are
vacuum_drying, where heat is supplied by conduction or radiation (or
microwaves), while the vapor thus produced is removed by the vacuum system.
Another indirect technique is drum_drying (used, for instance, for
manufacturing potato flakes), where a heated surface is used to provide the
energy, and aspirators draw the vapor outside the room. In contrast, the
mechanical extraction of the solvent, e.g., water, by filtration or
centrifugation, is not considered "drying" but rather "draining".

***** Drying mechanism[edit] *****
In some products having a relatively high initial moisture content, an initial
linear reduction of the average product moisture content as a function of time
may be observed for a limited time, often known as a "constant drying rate
period". Usually, in this period, it is surface moisture outside individual
particles that is being removed. The drying rate during this period is mostly
dependent on the rate of heat transfer to the material being dried. Therefore,
the maximum achievable drying rate is considered to be heat-transfer limited.
If drying is continued, the slope of the curve, the drying rate, becomes less
steep (falling rate period) and eventually tends to become nearly horizontal at
very long times. The product moisture content is then constant at the
"equilibrium_moisture_content", where it is, in practice, in equilibrium with
the dehydrating medium. In the falling-rate period, water migration from the
product interior to the surface is mostly by molecular diffusion, i,e. the
water flux is proportional to the moisture content gradient. This means that
water moves from zones with higher moisture content to zones with lower values,
a phenomenon explained by the second_law_of_thermodynamics. If water removal is
considerable, the products usually undergo shrinkage and deformation, except in
a well-designed freeze-drying process. The drying rate in the falling-rate
period is controlled by the rate of removal of moisture or solvent from the
interior of the solid being dried and is referred to as being "mass-transfer
limited". This is widely noticed in hygroscopic products such as fruits and
vegetables, where drying occurs in the falling rate period with the constant
drying rate period said to be negligible.[2]
***** Methods of drying[edit] *****
In a typical phase_diagram, the boundary between gas and liquid runs from the
triple point to the critical_point. Regular drying is the green arrow, while
supercritical_drying is the red arrow and freeze_drying is the blue.
The following are some general methods of drying:
    * Application of hot air (convective or direct drying). Air heating
      increases the drying force for heat transfer and accelerates drying. It
      also reduces air relative_humidity, further increasing the driving force
      for drying. In the falling rate period, as moisture content falls, the
      solids heat up and the higher temperatures speed up diffusion of water
      from the interior of the solid to the surface. However, product quality
      considerations limit the applicable rise to air temperature. Excessively
      hot air can almost completely dehydrate the solid surface, so that its
      pores shrink and almost close, leading to crust formation or "case
      hardening", which is usually undesirable. For instance in wood (timber)
      drying, air is heated (which speeds up drying) though some steam is also
      added to it (which hinders drying rate to a certain extent) in order to
      avoid excessive surface dehydration and product deformation owing to high
      moisture gradients across timber thickness. Spray_drying belongs in this
      category.
    * Indirect or contact drying (heating through a hot wall), as drum drying,
      vacuum drying. Again, higher wall temperatures will speed up drying but
      this is limited by product degradation or case-hardening. Drum_drying
      belongs in this category.
    * Dielectric drying (radiofrequency or microwaves being absorbed inside the
      material) is the focus of intense research nowadays. It may be used to
      assist air drying or vacuum drying. Researchers have found that microwave
      finish drying speeds up the otherwise very low drying rate at the end of
      the classical drying methods.
    * Freeze_drying or lyophilization is a drying method where the solvent is
      frozen prior to drying and is then sublimed, i.e., passed to the gas
      phase directly from the solid phase, below the melting point of the
      solvent. It is increasingly applied to dry foods, beyond its already
      classical pharmaceutical or medical applications. It keeps biological
      properties of proteins, and retains vitamins and bioactive compounds.
      Pressure can be reduced by a high vacuum pump (though freeze drying at
      atmospheric pressure is possible in dry air). If using a vacuum pump, the
      vapor produced by sublimation is removed from the system by converting it
      into ice in a condenser, operating at very low temperatures, outside the
      freeze drying chamber.
    * Supercritical_drying (superheated steam drying) involves steam drying of
      products containing water. This process is feasible because water in the
      product is boiled off, and joined with the drying medium, increasing its
      flow. It is usually employed in closed circuit and allows a proportion of
      latent heat to be recovered by recompression, a feature which is not
      possible with conventional air drying, for instance. The process has
      potential for use in foods if carried out at reduced pressure, to lower
      the boiling point.
    * Natural_air_drying takes place when materials are dried with unheated
      forced air, taking advantage of its natural drying potential. The process
      is slow and weather-dependent, so a wise strategy "fan off-fan on" must
      be devised considering the following conditions: Air temperature,
      relative humidity and moisture content and temperature of the material
      being dried. Grains are increasingly dried with this technique, and the
      total time (including fan off and on periods) may last from one week to
      various months, if a winter rest can be tolerated in cold areas.
***** Applications of drying[edit] *****

**** Food[edit] ****
Main article: Drying_(food)
Foods are dried to inhibit microbial development and quality decay. However,
the extent of drying depends on product end-use. Cereals and oilseeds are dried
after harvest to the moisture content that allows microbial stability during
storage. Vegetables are blanched before drying to avoid rapid darkening, and
drying is not only carried out to inhibit microbial growth, but also to avoid
browning during storage. Concerning dried fruits, the reduction of moisture
acts in combination with its acid and sugar contents to provide protection
against microbial growth. Products such as milk powder must be dried to very
low moisture contents in order to ensure flowability and avoid caking. This
moisture is lower than that required to ensure inhibition to microbial
development. Other products as crackers are dried beyond the microbial growth
threshold to confer a crispy texture, which is liked by consumers.
**** Non-food products[edit] ****
Among non-food products, some of those that require considerable drying are
wood (as part of timber processing), paper, flax, and washing powder. The first
two, owing to their organic origins, may develop mold if insufficiently dried.
Another benefit of drying is a reduction in volume and weight.
**** Sludges and fecal materials from sanitation processes[edit] ****
In the area of sanitation, drying of sewage_sludge from sewage_treatment
plants, fecal_sludge or feces collected in urine-diverting_dry_toilets (UDDT)
is a common method to achieve pathogen kill, as pathogens can only tolerate a
certain dryness level. In addition, drying is required as a process step if the
excreta based materials are meant to be incinerated.[3]
