From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
phase transition in which a liquid turns into a solid due to a decrease in
thermal energy
For other uses, see Freezing_(disambiguation).
Freezing is a phase_transition where a liquid turns into a solid when its
temperature is lowered below its freezing point. In accordance with the
internationally established definition, freezing means the solidification phase
change of a liquid or the liquid content of a substance, usually due to cooling
[1][2].
Although some authors differentiate solidification from freezing as a process
where a liquid turns into a solid by increasing the pressure, the two terms are
used interchangeably.
For most substances, the melting and freezing points are the same temperature;
however, certain substances possess differing solidâliquid transition
temperatures. For example, agar displays a hysteresis in its melting_point and
freezing point. It melts at 85 Â°C (185 Â°F) and solidifies from 32 Â°C to
40 Â°C (89.6 Â°F to 104 Â°F).[3]

***** Crystallization[edit] *****
Main article: Crystallization
Most liquids freeze by crystallization, formation of crystalline_solid from the
uniform liquid. This is a first-order thermodynamic phase_transition, which
means that as long as solid and liquid coexist, the temperature of the whole
system remains very nearly equal to the melting_point due to slow removal of
heat when in contact with air, which is a poor heat conductor. Because of the
latent_heat_of_fusion, the freezing is greatly slowed down and the temperature
will not drop anymore once the freezing starts but will continue dropping once
it finishes.[citation_needed] Crystallization consists of two major events,
nucleation and crystal_growth. Nucleation is the step wherein the molecules
start to gather into clusters, on the nanometer scale, arranging in a defined
and periodic manner that defines the crystal_structure. The crystal growth is
the subsequent growth of the nuclei that succeed in achieving the critical
cluster size.
***** Supercooling[edit] *****
Main article: Supercooling
[File:SuperCool 2009-01-02.ogv]Play_media
Rapid formation of ice crystals in supercool water (home freezer experiment)
In spite of the second_law_of_thermodynamics, crystallization of pure liquids
usually begins at a lower temperature than the melting_point, due to high
activation_energy of homogeneous_nucleation. The creation of a nucleus implies
the formation of an interface at the boundaries of the new phase. Some energy
is expended to form this interface, based on the surface_energy of each phase.
If a hypothetical nucleus is too small, the energy that would be released by
forming its volume is not enough to create its surface, and nucleation does not
proceed. Freezing does not start until the temperature is low enough to provide
enough energy to form stable nuclei. In presence of irregularities on the
surface of the containing vessel, solid or gaseous impurities, pre-formed solid
crystals, or other nucleators, heterogeneous_nucleation may occur, where some
energy is released by the partial destruction of the previous interface,
raising the supercooling point to be near or equal to the melting point. The
melting point of water at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close to 0 Â°C
(32 Â°F, 273.15 K), and in the presence of nucleating_substances the freezing
point of water is close to the melting point, but in the absence of nucleators
water can supercool to −40 Â°C (−40 Â°F, 233 K) before freezing.[4][5] Under
high pressure (2,000 atmospheres) water will supercool to as low as −70 Â°C
(−94 Â°F, 203 K) before freezing.[6]
***** Exothermicity[edit] *****
Main article: Enthalpy_of_fusion
Freezing is almost always an exothermic process, meaning that as liquid changes
into solid, heat and pressure are released. This is often seen as counter-
intuitive,[7] since the temperature of the material does not rise during
freezing, except if the liquid were supercooled. But this can be understood
since heat must be continually removed from the freezing liquid or the freezing
process will stop. The energy released upon freezing is a latent_heat, and is
known as the enthalpy_of_fusion and is exactly the same as the energy required
to melt the same amount of the solid.
Low-temperature helium is the only known exception to the general rule.[8]
Helium-3 has a negative enthalpy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. Helium-
4 also has a very slightly negative enthalpy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means
that, at appropriate constant pressures, heat must be added to these substances
in order to freeze them.[9]
***** Vitrification[edit] *****
Main article: Glass_transition
Certain materials, such as glass and glycerol, may harden without
crystallizing; these are called amorphous_solids. Amorphous materials, as well
as some polymers, do not have a freezing point, as there is no abrupt phase
change at any specific temperature. Instead, there is a gradual change in their
viscoelastic properties over a range of temperatures. Such materials are
characterized by a glass_transition that occurs at a glass_transition
temperature, which may be roughly defined as the "knee" point of the material's
density vs. temperature graph. Because vitrification is a non-equilibrium
process, it does not qualify as freezing, which requires an equilibrium between
the crystalline and liquid state.
***** Expansion[edit] *****
Some substances, such as water and bismuth, expand when frozen.
***** Freezing of living organisms[edit] *****
Main article: Cryobiology
Many living organisms are able to tolerate prolonged periods of time at
temperatures below the freezing point of water. Most living organisms
accumulate cryoprotectants such as anti-nucleating_proteins, polyols, and
glucose to protect themselves against frost_damage by sharp ice crystals. Most
plants, in particular, can safely reach temperatures of −4 Â°C to −12 Â°C.
Certain bacteria, notably Pseudomonas_syringae, produce specialized proteins
that serve as potent ice nucleators, which they use to force ice formation on
the surface of various fruits and plants at about −2 Â°C.[10] The freezing
causes injuries in the epithelia and makes the nutrients in the underlying
plant tissues available to the bacteria.[11]
**** Bacteria[edit] ****
Three species of bacteria, Carnobacterium_pleistocenium, as well as
Chryseobacterium_greenlandensis and Herminiimonas_glaciei, have reportedly been
revived after surviving for thousands of years frozen in ice.
**** Plants[edit] ****
Many plants undergo a process called hardening, which allows them to survive
temperatures below 0 Â°C for weeks to months.
**** Animals[edit] ****
The nematode Haemonchus_contortus can survive 44 weeks frozen at liquid
nitrogen temperatures. Other nematodes that survive at temperatures below 0 Â°C
include Trichostrongylus_colubriformis and Panagrolaimus_davidi. Many species
of reptiles and amphibians survive freezing. See cryobiology for a full
discussion.
Human gametes and 2-, 4- and 8-cell embryos can survive freezing and are viable
for up to 10 years, a process known as cryopreservation.
Experimental attempts to freeze human beings for later revival are known as
cryonics.
***** Food preservation[edit] *****
Main article: Frozen_food
Freezing is a common method of food_preservation that slows both food decay and
the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on
reaction_rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.
