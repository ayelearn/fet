Marmalade is a fruit_preserve made from the juice and peel of citrus_fruits
boiled with sugar and water. The best-known version is made from bitter_orange,
but it is also made from lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet_oranges,
bergamots, and other citrus fruits, or a combination.
The preferred citrus fruit for marmalade production nowadays is the Spanish
Seville_or_bitter_orange, Citrus aurantium var. aurantium, prized for its high
pectin content, which sets readily to the thick consistency expected of
marmalade. The peel imparts a bitter taste.
The word "marmalade" is borrowed from the Portuguese marmelada, from marmelo
'quince'.
Marmalade is generally distinguished from jam by its fruit peel. However, it
also may be distinguished from jam by the choice of fruit, though historically,
it has often been used for non-citrus preserves.[1]

***** Origins[edit] *****
The Romans learned from the Greeks that quinces slowly cooked with honey would
"set" when cool. The Apicius gives a recipe for preserving whole quinces, stems
and leaves attached, in a bath of honey diluted with defrutumâRoman
marmalade. Preserves of quince and lemon appearâalong with rose, apple, plum
and pearâin the Book_of_ceremonies of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine_VII
Porphyrogennetos.[1]
Medieval quince preserves, which went by the French name cotignac, produced in
a clear version and a fruit pulp version, began to lose their medieval
seasoning of spices in the 16th century. In the 17th century, La Varenne
provided recipes for both thick and clear cotignac.[2]
In 1524, Henry_VIII received a "box of marmalade" from Mr Hull of Exeter.[3] As
it was in a box, this was probably marmelada, a solid quince_paste from
Portugal, still made and sold in southern Europe. Its Portuguese origins can be
detected in the remarks in letters to Lord Lisle, from William Grett, 12 May
1534, "I have sent to your lordship a box of marmaladoo, and another unto my
good lady your wife" and from Richard Lee, 14 December 1536, "He most heartily
thanketh her Ladyship for her marmalado".[2] It was a favorite treat of Anne
Boleyn and her ladies in waiting.
Scottish grocer James_Robertson created Golden Shred marmalade in 1864
The English recipe book of Eliza Cholmondeley, dated from 1677 and held at the
Chester Record Office in the Cheshire county archivists, has one of the
earliest marmalade recipes ("Marmelet of Oranges") which produced a firm, thick
dark paste. The Scots are credited with developing marmalade as a spread, with
Scottish recipes in the 18th century using more water to produce a less solid
preserve.[4]
The first printed recipe for orange marmalade, though without the chunks
typically used now, was in Mary_Kettilby's 1714 cookery book, A_Collection_of
above_Three_Hundred_Receipts (pages 78â79).[5][6][7] Kettilby called for
whole oranges, lemon juice and sugar, with the acid in the lemon juice helping
to create the pectin set of marmalade, by boiling the lemon and orange juice
with the pulp.[4][7] Kettilby then directs: "boil the whole pretty fast 'till
it will jelly" â the first known use of the word "jelly" in marmalade making.
Kettilby then instructs that the mixture is then poured into glasses, covered
and left until set. As the acid would create a jelly, this meant that the
mixture could be pulled from the heat before it had turned to a paste, keeping
the marmalade much brighter and the appearance more translucent, as in modern-
day marmalade.[4]
The Scots moved marmalade to the breakfast table, and in the 19th century the
English followed the Scottish example and abandoned the eating of marmalade in
the evening. Marmalade's place in British life appears in literature. James
Boswell remarks that he and Samuel_Johnson were offered it at breakfast in
Scotland in 1773. When American writer Louisa_May_Alcott visited Britain in the
1800s, she described "a choice pot of marmalade and a slice of cold ham" as
"essentials of English table comfort".[7]
***** Etymology[edit] *****
Antique marmalade cutter, used to cut citrus fruit peel into thin slices
Marmalade first appeared in the English language in 1480, borrowed from French
marmelade which, in turn, came from the Galician-Portuguese word marmelada.
According to JosÃ© Pedro Machadoâs DicionÃ¡rio EtimolÃ³gico da LÃ­ngua
Portuguesa,[8] the oldest known document where this Portuguese word is to be
found is Gil_Vicenteâs play ComÃ©dia de Rubena, written in 1521:
      Temos tanta marmelada
      Que a minha mÃ£e vai me dar um pouco[9]
The extension of marmalade in the English language to refer to a preserve made
from citrus fruits occurred in the 17th century, when citrus first began to be
plentiful enough in England for the usage to become common.
Greek Î¼ÎµÎ»Î¯Î¼Î·Î»Î¿Î½ melimÄlon 'sweet apple', from Î¼Î­Î»Î· 'honey' +
Î¼á¿Î»Î¿Î½ mÄlon 'apple, round fruit', became Portuguese marmelo 'quince'.
[10][11]
In Portuguese, marmelada is a preserve made from quinces, quince_cheese.
There is an apocryphal story that Mary,_Queen_of_Scots, ate it when she had a
headache, and that the name is derived from her maids' whisper of Marie est
malade (Mary is ill). In reality, the word's origin has nothing to do with
Mary.[12]
**** International usage[edit] ****
Marmalade spread on bread
In much of Europe and Latin America, cognates for the English term "marmalade"
are still used as a generic term for preserves of all fruits, whereas in
Britain it refers solely to a citrus preserve.[4] The name originates in
Portuguese, where marmelada applies exclusively to quince_jam.[13][14] In
Spanish the term usually refers to what in English is called jam, and jalea â
used in Mexico and Central America â is similar to the American English
jelly.
***** Legal definitions[edit] *****
**** Canadian regulations[edit] ****
Under the Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870), marmalade is a
standardized food and defined as a food of jelly-like consistency that consists
of at least 65% water-soluble solids. The regulations permit the use of pH
adjusting_agents to prevent the marmalade from drying out, antifoaming_agents
to prevent blemishes on surface coatings and enable efficient filling of
containers, and acid ingredient to compensate for the natural acidity of the
citrus fruit used. If pectin or pectinous preparation is added, the marmalade
must contain at least 27% of peel, pulp, or juice of citrus fruit. Class II
preservatives may also be used.[15]
The Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870) specify that pineapple
or fig marmalade must be of jelly-like consistency, achieved by boiling the
pulp of juice of the fruit with water, and a sweetening ingredient. Pineapple
or fig marmalade should contain at least 45% of the named fruit.[15]
**** European regulation[edit] ****
Since 1979, the EU directive 79/693/CEE define marmalade as a jam made from
citrus fruits. The directive was replaced on 20/12/2001 by the ruling
32001L0113.[16]
***** Dundee marmalade[edit] *****
Jars of homemade marmalade
The Scottish city of Dundee has a long association with marmalade.[17] James
Keiller_and_his_wife_Janet ran a small sweet and preserves shop in the Seagate
area of Dundee.[18] In 1797, they opened a factory to produce "Dundee
Marmalade",[19] a preserve distinguished by thick chunks of bitter Seville
orange rind. The business prospered, and remains a signature marmalade producer
today.[20]
According to a Scottish legend, the creation of orange marmalade in Britain
occurred by accident. The legend tells of a ship carrying a cargo of oranges
that broke down in the port of Dundee, resulting in some ingenious locals
making marmalade out of the cargo.[18][21]
***** In children's literature[edit] *****
Paddington_Bear is known for his liking of marmalade, particularly in
sandwiches, and kept it in his briefcase wherever he went.[22] Paddington Bear
is now used on the label of the smaller peel ("shred") and clearer/milder
Robertson's "Golden Shred" marmalade, in place of the previous icon,
"Golliwog", which is now considered racially offensive. The 2014 movie
Paddington led to a slight increase in marmalade sales in the UK.[23]
