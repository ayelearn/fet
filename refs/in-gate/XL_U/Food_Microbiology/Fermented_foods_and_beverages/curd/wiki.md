Cheese_curds
Curd is a dairy_product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called
curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic
substance such as lemon_juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate.
The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid
masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw_milk alone or
pasteurized_milk with added lactic_acid_bacteria) will also naturally produce
curds, and sour_milk_cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is
one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to
varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents
(molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes
the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey_proteins, is the
whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins.
In Indian_English, used only in the Indian_subcontinent, curd or curds instead
refers to the traditional homemade_yogurt (also known as dahi[1]), while paneer
and chhena are used to denote curdled milk.

***** Types of curd[edit] *****
There are two methods to make curd, with rennet and with acid. Using acid, like
lemon juice, to make curd releases the lactose into the water. Thus the solid
curd formed from this method is good for people with lactose_intolerance. This
type of curd is known as Chhena in India.
Using rennet to make curd attaches the lactose to the solid coagulated
proteins. Thus it is not recommended for people with lactose intolerance. This
type of curd is the commercial cheese available in supermarkets, such as
Cheddar, Mozzarella, Swiss, Parmesan. Vegetarian rennet, usually from Withania
coagulans, is used to make paneer in India.
***** Uses[edit] *****
Lithuanian curd
Curd products vary by region and include cottage_cheese, curd_cheese (both
curdled by bacteria and sometimes also rennet), farmer_cheese, pot_cheese,
queso_blanco, and paneer. The word can also refer to a non-dairy substance of
similar appearance or consistency, though in these cases a modifier or the word
curdled is generally used.
In England, curds produced using rennet are referred to as junket; true curds
and whey are produced from the natural separation of milk due to its
environment (temperature, acidity).
Cheese_curds, drained of the whey and served without further processing or
aging, are popular in some French-speaking regions of Canada, such as Quebec,
parts of Ontario, and Atlantic_Canada. Throughout Canada cheese curds are
served with french_fries and gravy in a popular snack called poutine. Curds are
also typical of some Germanic-descent regions such as historic Waterloo_County
in Ontario.[2]
In some parts of the Midwestern_U.S., especially in Wisconsin, curds are eaten
fresh without further additions, or they are breaded and fried.
In Turkey, curds are called keÅ and are served on fried_bread and are also
eaten with macaroni in the provinces of Bolu and Zonguldak.
In Mexico, chongos_zamoranos is a dessert prepared with milk curdled with sugar
and cinnamon.
Albanian gjiza is made by boiling whey for about 15 minutes and adding vinegar
or lemon. The derivative is drained and salted to taste. Gjiza can be served
immediately or refrigerated for a couple of days.
