In geometry, bisection is the division of something into two equal or congruent
parts, usually by a line, which is then called a bisector. The most often
considered types of bisectors are the segment bisector (a line that passes
through the midpoint of a given segment) and the angle bisector (a line that
passes through the apex of an angle, that divides it into two equal angles).
In three-dimensional_space, bisection is usually done by a plane, also called
the bisector or bisecting plane.

***** Line segment bisector[edit] *****
Perpendicular Bisector
A line_segment bisector passes through the midpoint of the segment.
Particularly important is the perpendicular bisector of a segment, which,
according to its name, meets the segment at right_angles. The perpendicular
bisector of a segment also has the property that each of its points is
equidistant from the segment's endpoints. Therefore, Voronoi_diagram boundaries
consist of segments of such lines or planes.
In classical geometry, the bisection is a simple compass_and_straightedge
construction, whose possibility depends on the ability to draw circles of equal
radii and different centers. The segment is bisected by drawing intersecting
circles of equal radius, whose centers are the endpoints of the segment and
such that each circle goes through one endpoint. The line determined by the
points of intersection of the two circles is the perpendicular bisector of the
segment, since it crosses the segment at its center. This construction is in
fact used when constructing a line perpendicular to a given line at a given
point: drawing an arbitrary circle whose center is that point, it intersects
the line in two more points, and the perpendicular to be constructed is the one
bisecting the segment defined by these two points.
Brahmagupta's_theorem states that if a cyclic_quadrilateral is orthodiagonal
(that is, has perpendicular diagonals), then the perpendicular to a side from
the point of intersection of the diagonals always bisects the opposite side.
Algebraically, the perpendicular bisector of a line segment with endpoints
P  1   (  x  1   ,  y  1   )   {\displaystyle P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})}  [
{\displaystyle P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1})}] and      P  2   (  x  2   ,  y  2   )
{\displaystyle P_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})}  [{\displaystyle P_{2}(x_{2},y_{2})}] is
given by the equation
         ( x &#x2212;  x  1    )  2   + ( y &#x2212;  y  1    )  2   = ( x
      &#x2212;  x  2    )  2   + ( y &#x2212;  y  2    )  2   ,
      {\displaystyle (x-x_{1})^{2}+(y-y_{1})^{2}=(x-x_{2})^{2}+(y-y_{2})^{2},}
      [{\displaystyle (x-x_{1})^{2}+(y-y_{1})^{2}=(x-x_{2})^{2}+(y-y_{2})^
      {2},}]
which states that the squared distance of a point on the bisector to one
endpoint equals the squared distance from that point to the other endpoint.
***** Angle bisector[edit] *****
Bisection of an angle using a compass and straightedge
An angle bisector divides the angle into two angles with equal measures. An
angle only has one bisector. Each point of an angle bisector is equidistant
from the sides of the angle.
The interior or internal bisector of an angle is the line, half-line, or line
segment that divides an angle of less than 180Â° into two equal angles. The
exterior or external bisector is the line that divides the supplementary_angle
(of 180Â° minus the original angle), formed by one side forming the original
angle and the extension of the other side, into two equal angles.[1]
To bisect an angle with straightedge_and_compass, one draws a circle whose
center is the vertex. The circle meets the angle at two points: one on each
leg. Using each of these points as a center, draw two circles of the same size.
The intersection of the circles (two points) determines a line that is the
angle bisector.
The proof of the correctness of this construction is fairly intuitive, relying
on the symmetry of the problem. The trisection_of_an_angle (dividing it into
three equal parts) cannot be achieved with the compass and ruler alone (this
was first proved by Pierre_Wantzel).
The internal and external bisectors of an angle are perpendicular. If the angle
is formed by the two lines given algebraically as      l  1   x +  m  1   y +
n  1   = 0   {\displaystyle l_{1}x+m_{1}y+n_{1}=0}  [{\displaystyle l_{1}x+m_
{1}y+n_{1}=0}] and      l  2   x +  m  2   y +  n  2   = 0 ,   {\displaystyle
l_{2}x+m_{2}y+n_{2}=0,}  [{\displaystyle l_{2}x+m_{2}y+n_{2}=0,}] then the
internal and external bisectors are given by the two equations[2]:p.15
             l  1   x +  m  1   y +  n  1      l  1   2   +  m  1   2      =
      &#x00B1;     l  2   x +  m  2   y +  n  2      l  2   2   +  m  2   2
      .   {\displaystyle {\frac {l_{1}x+m_{1}y+n_{1}}{\sqrt {l_{1}^{2}+m_{1}^
      {2}}}}=\pm {\frac {l_{2}x+m_{2}y+n_{2}}{\sqrt {l_{2}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}}}}.}
      [{\displaystyle {\frac {l_{1}x+m_{1}y+n_{1}}{\sqrt {l_{1}^{2}+m_{1}^
      {2}}}}=\pm {\frac {l_{2}x+m_{2}y+n_{2}}{\sqrt {l_{2}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}}}}.}]
**** Triangle[edit] ****
[Incircle.svg]
*** Concurrencies and collinearities[edit] ***
The interior angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent in a point called the
incenter of the triangle, as seen in the diagram at right.
The bisectors of two exterior_angles and the bisector of the other interior
angle are concurrent.[3]:p.149
Three intersection points, each of an external angle bisector with the opposite
extended_side, are collinear (fall on the same line as each other).[3]:p. 149
Three intersection points, two of them between an interior angle bisector and
the opposite side, and the third between the other exterior angle bisector and
the opposite side extended, are collinear.[3]:p. 149
*** Angle bisector theorem[edit] ***
Main article: Angle_bisector_theorem
In this diagram, BD:DC = AB:AC.
The angle bisector theorem is concerned with the relative lengths of the two
segments that a triangle's side is divided into by a line that bisects the
opposite angle. It equates their relative lengths to the relative lengths of
the other two sides of the triangle.
*** Lengths[edit] ***
If the side lengths of a triangle are     a , b , c   {\displaystyle a,b,c}
[a,b,c], the semiperimeter     s = ( a + b + c )  /  2 ,   {\displaystyle s=
(a+b+c)/2,}  [s=(a+b+c)/2,] and A is the angle opposite side     a
{\displaystyle a}  [a], then the length of the internal bisector of angle A is
[3]:p. 70
            2   b c s ( s &#x2212; a )     b + c    ,   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {2{\sqrt {bcs(s-a)}}}{b+c}},}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {2{\sqrt {bcs(s-
      a)}}}{b+c}},}]
or in trigonometric terms,[4]
            2 b c   b + c    cos &#x2061;   A 2   .   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {2bc}{b+c}}\cos {\frac {A}{2}}.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {2bc}{b+c}}\cos
      {\frac {A}{2}}.}]
If the internal bisector of angle A in triangle ABC has length      t  a
{\displaystyle t_{a}}  [t_{a}] and if this bisector divides the side opposite A
into segments of lengths m and n, then[3]:p.70
          t  a   2   + m n = b c   {\displaystyle t_{a}^{2}+mn=bc}  [t_{a}^
      {2}+mn=bc]
where b and c are the side lengths opposite vertices B and C; and the side
opposite A is divided in the proportion b:c.
If the internal bisectors of angles A, B, and C have lengths      t  a   ,  t
b   ,   {\displaystyle t_{a},t_{b},}  [t_{a},t_{b},] and      t  c
{\displaystyle t_{c}}  [t_c], then[5]
            ( b + c  )  2     b c     t  a   2   +    ( c + a  )  2     c a
      t  b   2   +    ( a + b  )  2     a b     t  c   2   = ( a + b + c  )  2
      .   {\displaystyle {\frac {(b+c)^{2}}{bc}}t_{a}^{2}+{\frac {(c+a)^{2}}
      {ca}}t_{b}^{2}+{\frac {(a+b)^{2}}{ab}}t_{c}^{2}=(a+b+c)^{2}.}  [{\frac  {
      (b+c)^{2}}{bc}}t_{a}^{2}+{\frac  {(c+a)^{2}}{ca}}t_{b}^{2}+{\frac  {
      (a+b)^{2}}{ab}}t_{c}^{2}=(a+b+c)^{2}.]
No two non-congruent triangles share the same set of three internal angle
bisector lengths.[6][7]
*** Integer triangles[edit] ***
There exist integer_triangles_with_a_rational_angle_bisector.
**** Quadrilateral[edit] ****
The internal angle bisectors of a convex quadrilateral either form a cyclic
quadrilateral (that is, the four intersection points of adjacent angle
bisectors are concyclic),[8] or they are concurrent. In the latter case the
quadrilateral is a tangential_quadrilateral.
*** Rhombus[edit] ***
Each diagonal of a rhombus bisects opposite angles.
*** Ex-tangential quadrilateral[edit] ***
The excenter of an ex-tangential_quadrilateral lies at the intersection of six
angle bisectors. These are the internal angle bisectors at two opposite vertex
angles, the external angle bisectors (supplementary angle bisectors) at the
other two vertex angles, and the external angle bisectors at the angles formed
where the extensions_of_opposite_sides intersect.
**** Parabola[edit] ****
Main article: Parabola_Â§ Tangent_bisection_property
The tangent to a parabola at any point bisects the angle between the line
joining the point to the focus and the line from the point and perpendicular to
the directrix.
***** Bisectors of the sides of a polygon[edit] *****
**** Triangle[edit] ****
*** Medians[edit] ***
Each of the three medians of a triangle is a line segment going through one
vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side, so it bisects that side (though
not in general perpendicularly). The three medians intersect each other at the
centroid of the triangle, which is its center_of_mass if it has uniform
density; thus any line through a triangle's centroid and one of its vertices
bisects the opposite side. The centroid is twice as close to the midpoint of
any one side as it is to the opposite vertex.
*** Perpendicular bisectors[edit] ***
The interior perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is the segment,
falling entirely on and inside the triangle, of the line that perpendicularly
bisects that side. The three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle's three
sides intersect at the circumcenter (the center of the circle through the three
vertices). Thus any line through a triangle's circumcenter and perpendicular to
a side bisects that side.
In an acute_triangle the circumcenter divides the interior perpendicular
bisectors of the two shortest sides in equal proportions. In an obtuse_triangle
the two shortest sides' perpendicular bisectors (extended beyond their opposite
triangle sides to the circumcenter) are divided by their respective
intersecting triangle sides in equal proportions.[9]:Corollaries 5 and 6
For any triangle the interior perpendicular bisectors are given by      p  a
=     2 a T    a  2   +  b  2   &#x2212;  c  2       ,   {\displaystyle p_{a}=
{\tfrac {2aT}{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}},}  [p_a=\tfrac{2aT}{a^2+b^2-c^2},]      p  b
=     2 b T    a  2   +  b  2   &#x2212;  c  2       ,   {\displaystyle p_{b}=
{\tfrac {2bT}{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}},}  [p_b=\tfrac{2bT}{a^2+b^2-c^2},] and      p
c   =     2 c T    a  2   &#x2212;  b  2   +  c  2       ,   {\displaystyle p_
{c}={\tfrac {2cT}{a^{2}-b^{2}+c^{2}}},}  [p_c=\tfrac{2cT}{a^2-b^2+c^2},] where
the sides are     a &#x2265; b &#x2265; c   {\displaystyle a\geq b\geq c}
[a\geq b\geq c] and the area is     T .   {\displaystyle T.}  [T.][9]:Thm 2
**** Quadrilateral[edit] ****
The two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect
the midpoints of opposite sides, hence each bisecting two sides. The two
bimedians and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals are
concurrent at a point called the "vertex centroid" and are all bisected by this
point.[10]:p.125
The four "maltitudes" of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a
side through the midpoint of the opposite side, hence bisecting the latter
side. If the quadrilateral is cyclic (inscribed in a circle), these maltitudes
are concurrent at (all meet at) a common point called the "anticenter".
Brahmagupta's_theorem states that if a cyclic quadrilateral is orthodiagonal
(that is, has perpendicular diagonals), then the perpendicular to a side from
the point of intersection of the diagonals always bisects the opposite side.
The perpendicular_bisector_construction forms a quadrilateral from the
perpendicular bisectors of the sides of another quadrilateral.
***** Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors[edit] *****
**** Triangle[edit] ****
There are an infinitude of lines that bisect the area of a triangle. Three of
them are the medians of the triangle (which connect the sides' midpoints with
the opposite vertices), and these are concurrent at the triangle's centroid;
indeed, they are the only area bisectors that go through the centroid. Three
other area bisectors are parallel to the triangle's sides; each of these
intersects the other two sides so as to divide them into segments with the
proportions       2   + 1 : 1   {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}+1:1}  [{\sqrt
{2}}+1:1].[11] These six lines are concurrent three at a time: in addition to
the three medians being concurrent, any one median is concurrent with two of
the side-parallel area bisectors.
The envelope of the infinitude of area bisectors is a deltoid (broadly defined
as a figure with three vertices connected by curves that are concave to the
exterior of the deltoid, making the interior points a non-convex set).[11] The
vertices of the deltoid are at the midpoints of the medians; all points inside
the deltoid are on three different area bisectors, while all points outside it
are on just one. [1] The sides of the deltoid are arcs of hyperbolas that are
asymptotic to the extended sides of the triangle.[11] The ratio of the area of
the envelope of area bisectors to the area of the triangle is invariant for all
triangles, and equals        3 4     log  e   &#x2061; ( 2 ) &#x2212;    1 2
,   {\displaystyle {\tfrac {3}{4}}\log _{e}(2)-{\tfrac {1}{2}},}  [{\tfrac  {3}
{4}}\log _{e}(2)-{\tfrac  {1}{2}},] i.e. 0.019860... or less than 2%.
A cleaver of a triangle is a line segment that bisects the perimeter of the
triangle and has one endpoint at the midpoint of one of the three sides. The
three cleavers concur at (all pass through) the center_of_the_Spieker_circle,
which is the incircle of the medial_triangle. The cleavers are parallel to the
angle bisectors.
A splitter of a triangle is a line segment having one endpoint at one of the
three vertices of the triangle and bisecting the perimeter. The three splitters
concur at the Nagel_point of the triangle.
Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its
perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its
incircle). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.
A line through the incenter bisects one of the area or perimeter if and only if
it also bisects the other.[12]
**** Parallelogram[edit] ****
Any line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area[13] and the
perimeter.
**** Circle and ellipse[edit] ****
All area bisectors and perimeter bisectors of a circle or other ellipse go
through the center, and any chords through the center bisect the area and
perimeter. In the case of a circle they are the diameters of the circle.
***** Bisectors of diagonals[edit] *****
**** Parallelogram[edit] ****
The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
**** Quadrilateral[edit] ****
If a line segment connecting the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisects both
diagonals, then this line segment (the Newton_Line) is itself bisected by the
vertex_centroid.
***** Volume bisectors[edit] *****
A plane that divides two opposite edges of a tetrahedron in a given ratio also
divides the volume of the tetrahedron in the same ratio. Thus any plane
containing a bimedian (connector of opposite edges' midpoints) of a tetrahedron
bisects the volume of the tetrahedron[14][15]:pp.89â90
