In group_theory, a branch of abstract_algebra, a cyclic group or monogenous
group is a group that is generated by a single element.[1] That is, it is a set
of invertible elements with a single associative binary_operation, and it
contains an element g such that every other element of the group may be
obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation to g or its inverse. Each
element can be written as a power of g in multiplicative notation, or as a
multiple of g in additive notation. This element g is called a generator of the
group.[1]
Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive_group of Z, the
integers. Every finite cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the additive
group of Z/nZ, the integers modulo n. Every cyclic group is an abelian_group
(meaning that its group operation is commutative), and every finitely_generated
abelian group is a direct_product of cyclic groups.
Every cyclic group of prime order is a simple_group which cannot be broken down
into smaller groups. In the classification_of_finite_simple_groups, one of the
three infinite classes consists of the cyclic groups of prime order. The cyclic
groups of prime order are thus among the building blocks from which all groups
can be built.

***** Definition and notation[edit] *****
The six 6th complex roots_of_unity form a cyclic group under multiplication.
Here z is generator, but z2 is not, because its powers fail to produce the odd
powers of z.

 [Frieze_example_p1.png] [Frieze_example_p11g.png]
 [Frieze_hop.png]        [Frieze_step.png]
 Two frieze_groups are isomorphic to Z. With one generator, p1 has translations
 and p11g has glide reflections.
For any element g in any group G, one can form the subgroup of all integer
powers â¨gâ© = {gk | k ∈ Z}, called the cyclic subgroup of g. The order of g
is the number of elements in â¨gâ©; that is, the order of an element is equal
to the order of its cyclic subgroup.
A cyclic group is a group which is equal to one of its cyclic subgroups: G =
â¨gâ© for some element g, called a generator.
For a finite cyclic group G of order n we have G = {e, g, g2, . . . , gn−1},
where e is the identity element and gi = gj whenever i ≡ j (mod n); in
particular gn = g0 = e, and g−1 = gn−1. An abstract group defined by this
multiplication is often denoted Cn, and we say that G is isomorphic to the
standard cyclic group Cn. Such a group is also isomorphic to Z/nZ, the group of
integers modulo n with the addition operation, which is the standard cyclic
group in additive notation. Under the isomorphism χ defined by χ(gi) = i the
identity element e corresponds to 0, products correspond to sums, and powers
correspond to multiples.
For example, the set of complex 6th roots_of_unity
        G = { &#x00B1; 1 , &#x00B1; (    1 2     +      3  2    i ) ,
     &#x00B1; (    1 2     &#x2212;      3  2    i ) }   {\displaystyle
     G=\{\pm 1,\pm ({\tfrac {1}{2}}{+}{\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}i),\pm (
     {\tfrac {1}{2}}{-}{\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}i)\}}  [{\displaystyle G=\
     {\pm 1,\pm ({\tfrac {1}{2}}{+}{\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}i),\pm ({\tfrac
     {1}{2}}{-}{\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}i)\}}]
forms a group under multiplication. It is cyclic, since it is generated by the
primitive_root     z =    1 2    +     3  2    i =  e  2 &#x03C0; i  /  6   :
{\displaystyle z={\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}i=e^{2\pi i/6}:}  [
{\displaystyle z={\tfrac {1}{2}}+{\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}i=e^{2\pi i/6}:}] that
is, G = â¨zâ© = { 1, z, z2, z3, z4, z5 } with z6 = 1. Under a change of
letters, this is isomorphic to (structurally the same as) the standard cyclic
group of order 6, defined as C6 = â¨gâ© = { e, g, g2, g3, g4, g5 } with
multiplication gj Â· gk = gj+k (mod 6), so that g6 = g0 = e. These groups are
also isomorphic to Z/6Z = {0,1,2,3,4,5} with the operation of addition modulo
6, with zk and gk corresponding to k. For example, 1 + 2 â¡ 3 (mod 6)
corresponds to z1 Â· z2 = z3, and 2 + 5 â¡ 1 (mod 6) corresponds to z2 Â· z5 =
z7 = z1, and so on. Any element generates its own cyclic subgroup, such as
â¨z2â© = {e, z2, z4} of order 3, isomorphic to C3 and Z/3Z; and â¨z5â© =
{ e, z5, z10 = z4, z15 = z3, z20 = z2, z25 = z } = G, so that z5 has order 6
and is an alternative generator of G.
Instead of the quotient notations Z/nZ, Z/(n), or Z/n, some authors denote a
finite cyclic group as Zn, but this conflicts with the notation of number
theory, where Zp denotes a p-adic_number ring, or localization at a prime
ideal.
On the other hand, in an infinite cyclic group G = â¨gâ©, the powers gk give
distinct elements for all integers k, so that G = { . . . , g−2, g−1, e, g, g2,
. . . }, and G is isomorphic to the standard group C = Câ and to Z, the
additive group of the integers. An example is the first frieze_group. Here
there are no finite cycles, and the name "cyclic" may be misleading.[2]
To avoid this confusion, Bourbaki introduced the term monogenous group for a
group with a single generator and restricted "cyclic group" to mean a finite
monogenous group, avoiding the term "infinite cyclic group".[note_1]

**** Integer and modular addition[edit] ****
The set of integers Z,with the operation of addition, forms a group.[1] It is
an infinite cyclic group, because all integers can be written by repeatedly
adding or subtracting the single number 1. In this group, 1 and â1 are the
only generators. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to Z.
For every positive integer n, the set of integers modulo n, again with the
operation of addition, forms a finite cyclic group, denoted Z/nZ.[1] A modular
integer i is a generator of this group if i is relatively_prime to n, because
these elements can generate all other elements of the group through integer
addition. (The number of such generators is Ï(n), where Ï is the Euler
totient_function.) Every finite cyclic group G is isomorphic to Z/nZ, where n =
|G| is the order of the group.
The addition operations on integers and modular integers, used to define the
cyclic groups, are the addition operations of commutative_rings, also denoted Z
and Z/nZ or Z/(n). If p is a prime, then Z/pZ is a finite_field, and is usually
denoted Fp or GF(p).
**** Modular multiplication[edit] ****
Main article: Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n
For every positive integer n, the set of the integers modulo n that are
relatively prime to n is written as (Z/nZ)Ã; it forms_a_group under the
operation of multiplication. This group is not always cyclic, but is so
whenever n is 1, 2, 4, a power_of_an_odd_prime, or twice a power of an odd
prime (sequence A033948 in the OEIS). [4][5] This is the multiplicative group
of units of the ring Z/nZ; there are Ï(n) of them, where again Ï is the
totient function. For example, (Z/6Z)Ã = {1,5}, and since 6 is twice an odd
prime, this is a cyclic group. In contrast, (Z/8Z)Ã = {1,3,5,7} is a Klein_4-
group and is not cyclic. When (Z/nZ)Ã is cyclic, its generators are called
primitive_roots_modulo_n.
For a prime number p, the group (Z/pZ)Ã is always cyclic, consisting of the
non-zero elements of the finite_field of order p. More generally, every finite
subgroup of the multiplicative group of any field is cyclic.[6]
**** Rotational symmetries[edit] ****
Main article: Rotational_symmetry
The set of rotational_symmetries of a polygon forms a finite cyclic group.[7]
If there are n different ways of moving the polygon to itself by a rotation
(including the null rotation) then this symmetry group is isomorphic to Z/nZ.
In three or higher dimensions there exist other finite_symmetry_groups_that_are
cyclic, but which are not all rotations around an axis, but instead
rotoreflections.
The group of all rotations of a circle S1 (the circle_group, also denoted S1)
is not cyclic, because there is no single rotation whose integer powers
generate all rotations. In fact, the infinite cyclic group Câ is countable,
while S1 is not. The group of rotations by rational angles is countable, but
still not cyclic.
**** Galois theory[edit] ****
An nth root_of_unity is a complex_number whose nth power is 1, a root of the
polynomial xn â 1. The set of all nth roots of unity form a cyclic group of
order n under multiplication.[1] For example, the polynomial z3 â 1 factors
as (z â 1)(z â ω)(z â ω2), where ω = e2Ïi/3; the set {1, Ï, Ï2} =
{Ï0, Ï1, Ï2} forms a cyclic group under multiplication. The Galois_group of
the field_extension of the rational_numbers generated by the nth roots of unity
forms a different group, isomorphic to the multiplicative group (Z/nZ)Ã of
order Ï(n), which is cyclic for some but not all n (see above).
A field extension is called a cyclic_extension if its Galois group is cyclic.
For fields of characteristic_zero, such extensions are the subject of Kummer
theory, and are intimately related to solvability_by_radicals. For an extension
of finite_fields of characteristic p, its Galois group is always finite and
cyclic, generated by a power of the Frobenius_mapping.[8] Conversely, given a
finite field F and a finite cyclic group G, there is a finite field extension
of F whose Galois group is G.[9]
***** Subgroups[edit] *****
Main article: Fundamental_theorem_of_cyclic_groups
All subgroups and quotient_groups of cyclic groups are cyclic. Specifically,
all subgroups of Z are of the form â¨mâ© = mZ, with m a positive integer. All
of these subgroups are distinct from each other, and apart from the trivial
group {0} = 0Z, they all are isomorphic to Z. The lattice_of_subgroups of Z is
isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of natural numbers ordered by
divisibility.[10] Thus, since a prime number p has no nontrivial divisors, pZ
is a maximal proper subgroup, and the quotient group Z/pZ is simple; in fact, a
cyclic group is simple if and only if its order is prime.[11]
All quotient groups Z/nZ are finite, with the exception Z/0Z = Z/{0}. For every
positive divisor d of n, the quotient group Z/nZ has precisely one subgroup of
order d, generated by the residue_class of n/d. There are no other subgroups.
***** Additional properties[edit] *****
Every cyclic group is abelian.[1] That is, its group operation is commutative:
gh = hg (for all g and h in G). This is clear for the groups of integer and
modular addition since r + s â¡ s + r (mod n), and it follows for all cyclic
groups since they are all isomorphic to these standard groups. For a finite
cyclic group of order n, gn is the identity element for any element g. This
again follows by using the isomorphism to modular addition, since kn â¡ 0 (mod
n) for every integer k. (This is also true for a general group of order n, due
to Lagrange's_theorem.)
For a prime_power pk, the group Z/pkZ is called a primary_cyclic_group. The
fundamental_theorem_of_abelian_groups states that every finitely_generated
abelian_group is a finite direct product of primary cyclic and infinite cyclic
groups.
Because a cyclic group is abelian, each of its conjugacy_classes consists of a
single element. A cyclic group of order n therefore has n conjugacy classes.
If d is a divisor of n, then the number of elements in Z/nZ which have order d
is Ï(d), and the number of elements whose order divides d is exactly d. If G
is a finite group in which, for each n > 0, G contains at most n elements of
order dividing n, then G must be cyclic.[note_2] The order of an element m in
Z/nZ is n/gcd(n,m).
If n and m are coprime, then the direct_product of two cyclic groups Z/nZ and
Z/mZ is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z/nmZ, and the converse also holds: this
is one form of the Chinese_remainder_theorem. For example, Z/12Z is isomorphic
to the direct product Z/3Z Ã Z/4Z under the isomorphism (k mod 12) â (k mod
3, k mod 4); but it is not isomorphic to Z/6Z Ã Z/2Z, in which every element
has order at most 6.
If p is a prime_number, then any group with p elements is isomorphic to the
simple group Z/pZ. A number n is called a cyclic_number if Z/nZ is the only
group of order n, which is true exactly when gcd(n,Ï(n)) = 1.[13] The cyclic
numbers include all primes, but some are composite such as 15. However, all
cyclic numbers are odd except 2. The cyclic numbers are:
      1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47,
      51, 53, 59, 61, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 95, 97,
      101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 115, 119, 123, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 141,
      143, ... (sequence A003277 in the OEIS)
The definition immediately implies that cyclic groups have group_presentation
Câ = &#x27e8;x | &#x27e9; and Cn = &#x27e8;x | xn&#x27e9; for finite n.[14]
***** Associated objects[edit] *****
**** Representations[edit] ****
The representation_theory of the cyclic group is a critical base case for the
representation theory of more general finite groups. In the complex_case, a
representation of a cyclic group decomposes into a direct sum of linear
characters, making the connection between character theory and representation
theory transparent. In the positive_characteristic_case, the indecomposable
representations of the cyclic group form a model and inductive basis for the
representation theory of groups with cyclic Sylow_subgroups and more generally
the representation theory of blocks of cyclic defect.
**** Cycle graph[edit] ****
Further information: Cycle_graph_(algebra)
A cycle graph illustrates the various cycles of a group and is particularly
useful in visualizing the structure of small finite_groups. A cycle graph for a
cyclic group is simply a circular_graph, where the group order is equal to the
number of nodes. A single generator defines the group as a directional path on
the graph, and the inverse generator defines a backwards path. Trivial paths
(identity) can be drawn as a loop but are usually suppressed. Z2 is sometimes
drawn with two curved edges as a multigraph.[15]
Cyclic groups Zn, order n, is a single cycle graphed simply as an n-sided
polygon with the elements at the vertices. When n = ab with a and b being
relatively_prime (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1), a cyclic group Zn can be decomposed
into a direct_product Za Ã Zb.

**** Cayley graph[edit] ****
Main article: Circulant_graph
The Paley_graph of order 13, a circulant graph formed as the Cayley graph of Z/
13 with generator set {1,3,4}
A Cayley_graph is a graph defined from a pair (G,S) where G is a group and S is
a set of generators for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and
an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In the case of a
finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a cycle
graph, and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is
a doubly infinite path_graph. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other
sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary
generator sets are called circulant_graphs.[16] These graphs may be represented
geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with
each point connected to neighbors with the same set of distances as each other
point. They are exactly the vertex-transitive_graphs whose symmetry_group
includes a transitive cyclic group.[17]
**** Endomorphisms[edit] ****
The endomorphism_ring of the abelian group Z/nZ is isomorphic to Z/nZ itself as
a ring.[18] Under this isomorphism, the number r corresponds to the
endomorphism of Z/nZ that maps each element to the sum of r copies of it. This
is a bijection if and only if r is coprime with n, so the automorphism_group of
Z/nZ is isomorphic to the unit group (Z/nZ)Ã.[18]
Similarly, the endomorphism ring of the additive group of Z is isomorphic to
the ring Z. Its automorphism group is isomorphic to the group of units of the
ring Z, i.e. to ({â1, +1}, Ã) â C2.
**** Tensor product and Hom of cyclic groups[edit] ****
The tensor_product      Z   /  m   Z   &#x2297;  Z   /  n   Z
{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /m{\mathbf {Z} }\otimes \mathbf {Z} /n{\mathbf {Z}
}}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /m{\mathbf {Z} }\otimes \mathbf {Z} /n{\mathbf
{Z} }}] can be shown to be isomorphic to      Z   /  gcd ( m , n )   Z
{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /\gcd(m,n){\mathbf {Z} }}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf
{Z} /\gcd(m,n){\mathbf {Z} }}]. So we can form the collection of group
homomorphisms from      Z   /  m   Z     {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /m{\mathbf
{Z} }}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /m{\mathbf {Z} }}] to      Z   /  n   Z
{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /n{\mathbf {Z} }}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /n
{\mathbf {Z} }}], denoted     hom &#x2061; (  Z   /  m   Z   ,  Z   /  n   Z
)   {\displaystyle \hom(\mathbf {Z} /m{\mathbf {Z} },\mathbf {Z} /n{\mathbf {Z}
})}  [{\displaystyle \hom(\mathbf {Z} /m{\mathbf {Z} },\mathbf {Z} /n{\mathbf
{Z} })}], which is itself a group.
For the tensor product, this is a consequence of the general fact that     R  /
I  &#x2297;  R   R  /  J &#x2245; R  /  ( I + J )   {\displaystyle R/I\otimes _
{R}R/J\cong R/(I+J)}  [R/I\otimes _{R}R/J\cong R/(I+J)], where     R
{\displaystyle R}  [R] is a commutative ring with unit and     I
{\displaystyle I}  [I] and     J   {\displaystyle J}  [J] are ideals of the
ring. For the Hom group, recall that it is isomorphic to the subgroup of      Z
/  n   Z     {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} /n{\mathbf {Z} }}  [{\displaystyle
\mathbf {Z} /n{\mathbf {Z} }}] consisting of the elements of order dividing m.
That subgroup is cyclic of order gcd(m, n), which completes the proof.
***** Related classes of groups[edit] *****
Several other classes of groups have been defined by their relation to the
cyclic groups:
**** Virtually cyclic groups[edit] ****
A group is called virtually cyclic if it contains a cyclic subgroup of finite
index (the number of cosets that the subgroup has). In other words, any element
in a virtually cyclic group can be arrived at by applying a member of the
cyclic subgroup to a member in a certain finite set. Every cyclic group is
virtually cyclic, as is every finite group. An infinite group is virtually
cyclic if and only if it is finitely_generated and has exactly two ends;[note
3] an example of such a group is the direct_product of Z/nZ and Z, in which the
factor Z has finite index n. Every abelian subgroup of a Gromov_hyperbolic
group is virtually cyclic.[20]
**** Locally cyclic groups[edit] ****
Main article: Locally_cyclic_group
A locally_cyclic_group is a group in which each finitely_generated subgroup is
cyclic. An example is the additive group of the rational_numbers: every finite
set of rational numbers is a set of integer multiples of a single unit
fraction, the inverse of their lowest_common_denominator, and generates as a
subgroup a cyclic group of integer multiples of this unit fraction. A group is
locally cyclic if and only if its lattice_of_subgroups is a distributive
lattice.[21]
**** Cyclically ordered groups[edit] ****
Main article: Cyclically_ordered_group
A cyclically_ordered_group is a group together with a cyclic_order preserved by
the group structure. Every cyclic group can be given a structure as a
cyclically ordered group, consistent with the ordering of the integers (or the
integers modulo the order of the group). Every finite subgroup of a cyclically
ordered group is cyclic.[22]
**** Metacyclic and polycyclic groups[edit] ****
A metacyclic_group is a group containing a cyclic normal_subgroup whose
quotient is also cyclic.[23] These groups include the cyclic groups, the
dicyclic_groups, and the direct_products of two cyclic groups. The polycyclic
groups generalize metacyclic groups by allowing more than one level of group
extension. A group is polycyclic if it has a finite descending sequence of
subgroups, each of which is normal in the previous subgroup with a cyclic
quotient, ending in the trivial group. Every finitely generated abelian_group
or nilpotent_group is polycyclic.[24]

**** Notes[edit] ****
   1. ^ DEFINITION 15. A group is called monogenous if it admits a system of
      generators consisting of a single element. A finite monogenous group is
      called cyclic.[3]
   2. ^ This implication remains true even if only prime values of n are
      considered.[12] (And observe that when n is prime, there is exactly one
      element whose order is a proper divisor of n, namely the identity.)
   3. ^ If G has two ends, the explicit structure of G is well known: G is an
      extension of a finite group by either the infinite cyclic group or the
      infinite dihedral group.[19]
