Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy FRS FRSE (/koÊËÊiË/;[1] French: [oÉ¡ystÉÌ_lwi
koÊi]; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician, engineer, and
physicist who made pioneering contributions to several branches of mathematics,
including mathematical_analysis and continuum_mechanics. He was one of the
first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus, rejecting the
heuristic principle of the generality_of_algebra of earlier authors. He almost
singlehandedly founded complex_analysis and the study of permutation_groups in
abstract_algebra.
A profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries
and successors;[2] Hans_Freudenthal stated: "More concepts and theorems have
been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone
there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy)."[3] Cauchy was a
prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and
five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and
mathematical_physics.

***** Biography[edit] *****
**** Youth and education[edit] ****
Cauchy was the son of Louis_FranÃ§ois_Cauchy (1760â1848) and Marie-Madeleine
Desestre. Cauchy had two brothers: Alexandre Laurent Cauchy (1792â1857), who
became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of
the court of cassation in 1849, and Eugene FranÃ§ois Cauchy (1802â1877), a
publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.
Cauchy married Aloise de Bure in 1818. She was a close relative of the
publisher who published most of Cauchy's works. They had two daughters, Marie
FranÃ§oise Alicia (1819) and Marie Mathilde (1823).
Cauchy's father (Louis_FranÃ§ois_Cauchy) was a high official in the Parisian
Police of the Ancien_RÃ©gime, but lost this position due to the French
Revolution (July 14, 1789), which broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was
born.[4] The Cauchy family survived the revolution and the following Reign_of
Terror (1793-4) by escaping to Arcueil, where Cauchy received his first
education, from his father.[5] After the execution of Robespierre (1794), it
was safe for the family to return to Paris. There Louis-FranÃ§ois Cauchy found
himself a new bureaucratic job in 1800,[6] and quickly moved up the ranks. When
Napoleon_Bonaparte came to power (1799), Louis-FranÃ§ois Cauchy was further
promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under
Laplace (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics). The
famous mathematician Lagrange was also a friend of the Cauchy family.[7]
On Lagrange's advice, Augustin-Louis was enrolled in the Ãcole_Centrale_du
PanthÃ©on, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of
1802.[6] Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and
ambitious Cauchy, being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and the
humanities. In spite of these successes, Augustin-Louis chose an engineering
career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the Ãcole
Polytechnique.
In 1805, he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam, and he was
admitted.[6] One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil
and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education. The
school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious
Cauchy some problems in adapting. Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique
in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the Ãcole_des_Ponts_et_ChaussÃ©es
(School for Bridges and Roads). He graduated in civil engineering, with the
highest honors.
**** Engineering days[edit] ****
After finishing school in 1810, Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in
Cherbourg, where Napoleon intended to build a naval base. Here Augustin-Louis
stayed for three years, and was assigned the Ourcq_Canal project and the Saint-
Cloud_Bridge project, and worked at the Harbor of Cherbourg.[6] Although he had
an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three
mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the PremiÃ¨re Classe (First
Class) of the Institut_de_France.[8] Cauchy's first two manuscripts (on
polyhedra) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of conic_sections) was
rejected.
In September 1812, now 23 years old, Cauchy returned to Paris after becoming
ill from overwork.[6] Another reason for his return to the capital was that he
was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted
to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better
chance to find a mathematics related position. Therefore, when his health
improved in 1813, Cauchy chose to not return to Cherbourg.[6] Although he
formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of
the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three
years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite
fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric
functions, the symmetric_group and the theory of higher-order algebraic
equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France
but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon
was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king Louis_XVIII took
the restoration in hand. The AcadÃ©mie_des_Sciences was re-established in March
1816; Lazare_Carnot and Gaspard_Monge were removed from this Academy for
political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of
them. The reaction of Cauchy's peers was harsh; they considered the acceptance
of his membership in the Academy an outrage, and Cauchy thereby created many
enemies in scientific circles.
**** Professor at Ãcole Polytechnique[edit] ****
In November 1815, Louis_Poinsot, who was an associate professor at the Ãcole
Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health
reasons. Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a
professorship. One of his great successes at that time was the proof of
Fermat's polygonal_number_theorem. However, the fact that Cauchy was known to
be very loyal to the Bourbons, doubtless also helped him in becoming the
successor of Poinsot. He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-
year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the Ãcole
Polytechnique. In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized,
and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary Cauchy was promoted
to full professor.
When Cauchy was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents. His father
found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride, AloÃ¯se
de Bure, five years his junior. The de Bure family were printers and
booksellers, and published most of Cauchy's works.[9] AloÃ¯se and Augustin were
married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the
Church of Saint-Sulpice. In 1819 the couple's first daughter, Marie FranÃ§oise
Alicia, was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter, Marie Mathilde.[10]
The conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy
perfectly. In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by his even more
reactionary brother Charles_X. During these years Cauchy was highly productive,
and published one important mathematical treatise after another. He received
cross appointments at the CollÃ¨ge_de_France, and the FacultÃ©_des_sciences_de
Paris [fr].
**** In exile[edit] ****
In July 1830, the July_Revolution occurred in France. Charles X fled the
country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king Louis-Philippe (of the House
of_OrlÃ©ans). Riots, in which uniformed students of the Ãcole Polytechnique
took an active part, raged close to Cauchy's home in Paris.
These events marked a turning point in Cauchy's life, and a break in his
mathematical productivity. Cauchy, shaken by the fall of the government, and
moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go
abroad, leaving his family behind.[11] He spent a short time at Fribourg in
Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of
allegiance to the new regime. He refused to do this, and consequently lost all
his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath
was not required. In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after
some time there, he accepted an offer from the King_of_Sardinia (who ruled
Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics,
which was created especially for him. He taught in Turin during 1832â1833. In
1831, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences,
and the following year a Foreign Honorary Member of the American_Academy_of
Arts_and_Sciences.[12]
In August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for Prague, to become the science tutor of the
thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux Henri_d'Artois (1820â1883), the exiled
Crown Prince and grandson of Charles X.[13] As a professor of the Ãcole
Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of
understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming
his allotted time with too much material. The young Duke had neither taste nor
talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect
mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with
great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.
During his civil engineering days, Cauchy once had been briefly in charge of
repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning
this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister
Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted
until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838.[13] Cauchy did
hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong
dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was
Cauchy's promotion to baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834,
his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited
with his family after four years in exile.
**** Last years[edit] ****
Cauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in
1838.[13] He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused
to swear an oath of allegiance.
Cauchy prior to 1857
In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau_des_Longitudes. This Bureau had
some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its
members. Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could "forget"
about the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they
were obliged to take it. The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded
in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea â mainly the
longitudinal coordinate, since latitude is easily determined from the position
of the sun. Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by
astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization
resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.
In November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately
that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath,
the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the
position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal
member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in
meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths;
however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial
mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy.
He also described and illustrated the signed-digit_representation of numbers,
an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John_Colson. The confounded
membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally
replaced by Poinsot.
Throughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over
the separation of Church and State. After losing control of the public
education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of
education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally. He lent his
prestige and knowledge to the Ãcole_Normale_ÃcclÃ©siastique, a school in
Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He also took
part in the founding of the Institut_Catholique. The purpose of this institute
was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in
France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who,
on the whole, supported the_Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution. When
a chair of mathematics became vacant at the CollÃ¨ge de France in 1843, Cauchy
applied for it, but got just three out of 45 votes.
The year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out
in numerous countries, beginning in France. King Louis-Philippe, fearful of
sharing the fate of Louis XVI, fled to England. The oath of allegiance was
abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for
Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the FacultÃ© de Sciences, as a
professor of mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848,
France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of Louis_Napoleon
Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, and son of Napoleon's brother, who had
been installed as the first king of Holland. Soon (early 1852) the President
made himself Emperor of France, and took the name Napoleon_III.
Not unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be
useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including
university professors. This time a cabinet minister was able to convince the
Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained a professor at the
University until his death at the age of 67. He received the Last_Rites and
died of a bronchial condition at 4 a.m. on 23 May 1857.[13]
His name is one of the 72_names_inscribed_on_the_Eiffel_Tower.
***** Work[edit] *****
**** Early work[edit] ****
The genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the problem_of
Apolloniusâdescribing a circle touching three given circlesâwhich he
discovered in 1805, his generalization of Euler's_formula on polyhedra in 1811,
and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on wave
propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in
1816. Cauchy's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series,
where he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic
formulas for q-series. In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was
the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. He also wrote on
the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential
equations and determinants.[2]
**** Wave theory, mechanics, elasticity[edit] ****
In the theory of light he worked on Fresnel's wave theory and on the dispersion
and polarization of light. He also contributed significant research in
mechanics, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical
displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter. He wrote on the
equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media. He
introduced[14] a 3 Ã 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the
Cauchy_stress_tensor. In elasticity, he originated the theory of stress, and
his results are nearly as valuable as those of SimÃ©on_Poisson.[2]
**** Number theory[edit] ****
Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the Fermat
polygonal_number_theorem.
**** Complex functions[edit] ****
Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex_function
theory. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy, now known as Cauchy's
integral_theorem, was the following:
             &#x222E;       C   &#x2061; f ( z ) d z = 0 ,   {\displaystyle
      \oint _{C}f(z)dz=0,}  [
       \oint_C f(z)dz = 0,
      ]
where f(z) is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-
intersecting closed curve C (contour) lying in the complex_plane. The contour
integral is taken along the contour C. The rudiments of this theorem can
already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the
AcadÃ©mie des Sciences (then still called "First Class of the Institute") on
August 11, 1814. In full form the theorem was given in 1825.[15] The 1825 paper
is seen by many[by_whom?] as Cauchy's most important contribution to
mathematics.
In 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a residue of a function.[16] This
concept regards functions that have polesâisolated singularities, i.e.,
points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-
valued function f(z) can be expanded in the neighborhood of a singularity a as
         f ( z ) = &#x03D5; ( z ) +    B  1    z &#x2212; a    +    B  2    ( z
      &#x2212; a  )  2      + &#x22EF; +    B  n    ( z &#x2212; a  )  n      ,
      B  i   , z , a &#x2208;  C  ,   {\displaystyle f(z)=\phi (z)+{\frac {B_
      {1}}{z-a}}+{\frac {B_{2}}{(z-a)^{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {B_{n}}{(z-a)^
      {n}}},\quad B_{i},z,a\in \mathbb {C} ,}  [
      f(z) = \phi(z) + \frac{B_1}{z-a} + \frac{B_2}{(z-a)^2} + \cdots + \frac
      {B_n}{(z-a)^n},\quad
      B_i, z,a \in \mathbb{C},
      ]
where Ï(z) is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then f is
said to have a pole of order n in the point a. If n = 1, the pole is called
simple. The coefficient B1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function f at a.
If f is non-singular at a then the residue of f is zero at a. Clearly the
residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to,
            R e s   z = a    f ( z ) =  lim  z &#x2192; a   ( z &#x2212; a ) f
      ( z ) ,   {\displaystyle {\underset {z=a}{\mathrm {Res} }}f(z)=\lim _
      {z\rightarrow a}(z-a)f(z),}  [
      \underset{z=a}{\mathrm{Res}} f(z) = \lim_{z \rightarrow a} (z-a) f(z),
      ]
where we replaced B1 by the modern notation of the residue.
In 1831, while in Turin, Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences
of Turin. In the first[17] he proposed the formula now known as Cauchy's
integral_formula,
         f ( a ) =   1  2 &#x03C0; i        &#x222E;       C   &#x2061;    f
      ( z )   z &#x2212; a    d z ,   {\displaystyle f(a)={\frac {1}{2\pi
      i}}\oint _{C}{\frac {f(z)}{z-a}}dz,}  [
      f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz,
      ]
where f(z) is analytic on C and within the region bounded by the contour C and
the complex number a is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken
counter-clockwise. Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at z = a. In the
second paper[18] he presented the residue_theorem,
           1  2 &#x03C0; i        &#x222E;       C   &#x2061; f ( z ) d z =
      &#x2211;  k = 1   n      R e s   z =  a  k      f ( z ) ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2\pi i}}\oint _{C}f(z)dz=\sum _{k=1}^{n}
      {\underset {z=a_{k}}{\mathrm {Res} }}f(z),}  [
       \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C f(z) dz = \sum_{k=1}^n \underset{z=a_k}{\mathrm
      {Res}} f(z),
      ]
where the sum is over all the n poles of f(z) on and within the contour C.
These results of Cauchy's still form the core of complex function theory as it
is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time,
contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory, believing it to be too
complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with Pierre
Alphonse_Laurent being the first mathematician, besides Cauchy, making a
substantial contribution (his Laurent_series published in 1843).
**** Cours d'Analyse[edit] ****
Main article: Cours_d'Analyse
The title page of a textbook by Cauchy.
In his book Cours d'Analyse Cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in
analysis. Rigor in this case meant the rejection of the principle of Generality
of_algebra (of earlier authors such as Euler and Lagrange) and its replacement
by geometry and infinitesimals.[19] Judith Grabiner wrote Cauchy was "the man
who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe."(Grabiner_1981) The book is
frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and     &#x03B4;
&#x2212; &#x03F5;   {\displaystyle \delta -\epsilon }  [\delta-\epsilon]
arguments were introduced into Calculus. Here Cauchy defined continuity as
follows: The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given
limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable
always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself.
M. Barany claims that the Ãcole mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal
methods against Cauchy's better judgement (Barany_2011). Gilain notes that when
the portion of the curriculum devoted to Analyse AlgÃ©brique was reduced in
1825, Cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and
therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus
(Gilain_1989). Laugwitz (1989) and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) point out that Cauchy
continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.
Cauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence
tending to zero. There has been a vast body of literature written about
Cauchy's notion of "infinitesimally small quantities", arguing they lead from
everything from the usual "epsilontic" definitions or to the notions of non-
standard_analysis. The consensus is that Cauchy omitted or left implicit the
important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small
quantities he used. (Barany_2013)
**** Taylor's theorem[edit] ****
He was the first to prove Taylor's_theorem rigorously, establishing his well-
known form of the remainder.[2] He wrote a textbook[20] (see the illustration)
for his students at the Ãcole Polytechnique in which he developed the basic
theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible. In this book he
gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the
form that is still taught. Also Cauchy's well-known test for absolute
convergence stems from this book: Cauchy_condensation_test. In 1829 he defined
for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another
textbook.[21] In spite of these, Cauchy's own research papers often used
intuitive, not rigorous, methods;[22] thus one of his theorems was exposed to a
"counter-example" by Abel, later fixed by the introduction of the notion of
uniform_continuity.
**** Argument principle, stability[edit] ****
In a paper published in 1855, two years before Cauchy's death, he discussed
some theorems, one of which is similar to the "Argument_Principle" in many
modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks, the
Cauchy_argument_principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist
stability_criterion, which can be used to predict the stability of negative
feedback_amplifier and negative feedback control systems. Thus Cauchy's work
has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.
**** Output[edit] ****

***** Politics and religious beliefs[edit] *****
Augustin-Louis Cauchy grew up in the house of a staunch royalist. This made his
father flee with the family to Arcueil during the French_Revolution. Their life
there during that time was apparently hard; Augustin-Louis's father, Louis
FranÃ§ois, spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A
paragraph from an undated letter from Louis FranÃ§ois to his mother in Rouen
says:[23]
     We never had more than a half pound [250 g] of bread â and
     sometimes not even that. This we supplement with little supply of
     hard crackers and rice that we are allotted. Otherwise, we are
     getting along quite well, which is the important thing and goes to
     show that human beings can get by with little. I should tell you that
     for my children's pap I still have a bit of fine flour, made from
     wheat that I grew on my own land. I had three bushels, and I also
     have a few pounds of potato_starch. It is as white as snow and very
     good, too, especially for very young children. It, too, was grown on
     my own land.[24]
In any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to
take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X.
He was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society_of_Saint_Vincent
de_Paul.[25] He also had links to the Society_of_Jesus and defended them at the
Academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may
have led to his caring for Charles_Hermite during his illness and leading
Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on
behalf of the Irish during the Potato_Famine.
His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused
difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his
beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating
them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been
suppressed. Niels_Henrik_Abel called him a "bigoted Catholic"[26] and added he
was "mad and there is nothing that can be done about him", but at the same time
praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among
mathematicians and when Guglielmo_Libri_Carucci_dalla_Sommaja was made chair in
mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When
Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph_Liouville rather
than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute
with political overtones concerned Jean_Marie_Constant_Duhamel and a claim on
inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by Jean-Victor_Poncelet, to be wrong.
