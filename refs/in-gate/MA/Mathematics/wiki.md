Field of study concerning quantity, patterns and change
Euclid (holding calipers), Greek mathematician, 3rd century BC, as imagined by
Raphael in this detail from The_School_of_Athens.[a]
Mathematics (from Greek Î¼Î¬Î¸Î·Î¼Î± mÃ¡thÄma, "knowledge, study, learning")
includes the study of such topics as quantity (number_theory),[1] structure
(algebra),[2] space (geometry),[1] and change (mathematical_analysis).[3][4][5]
It has no generally accepted definition.[6][7]
Mathematicians seek and use patterns[8][9] to formulate new conjectures; they
resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical_proof. When
mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical
reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of
abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation,
measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical
objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as
written_records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can
take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
Rigorous_arguments first appeared in Greek_mathematics, most notably in
Euclid's Elements. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe_Peano (1858â1932),
David_Hilbert (1862â1943), and others on_axiomatic_systems_in_the_late
19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as
establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and
definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the
Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific
discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that
has continued to the present day.[10]
Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural_science,
engineering, medicine, finance, and the social_sciences. Applied_mathematics
has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game
theory. Mathematicians engage in pure_mathematics (mathematics for its own
sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for
what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.[11][12]

***** History *****
Main article: History_of_mathematics
The Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton 322, dated to 1800 BC.
Archimedes used the method_of_exhaustion to approximate the value of pi.
The numerals used in the Bakhshali_manuscript, dated between the 2nd century
BCE and the 2nd century CE.
The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of
abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,[13] was
probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a
collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely
quantity of their members.
As evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count
physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count
abstract quantities, like time â days, seasons, years.[14]
Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000 BC,
when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry
for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction,
and for astronomy.[15] The most ancient mathematical texts from Mesopotamia and
Egypt are from 2000â1800 BC. Many early texts mention Pythagorean_triples and
so, by inference, the Pythagorean_theorem seems to be the most ancient and
widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is
in Babylonian_mathematics that elementary_arithmetic (addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division) first appear in the archaeological record. The
Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a sexagesimal numeral
system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.[16]
Beginning in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, the Ancient_Greeks began
a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with Greek
mathematics.[17] Around 300 BC, Euclid introduced the axiomatic_method still
used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.
His textbook Elements is widely considered the most successful and influential
textbook of all time.[18] The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held
to be Archimedes (c. 287â212 BC) of Syracuse.[19] He developed formulas for
calculating the surface area and volume of solids_of_revolution and used the
method_of_exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the
summation_of_an_infinite_series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern
calculus.[20] Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic
sections (Apollonius_of_Perga, 3rd century BC),[21] trigonometry (Hipparchus_of
Nicaea (2nd century BC),[22] and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd
century AD).[23]
The HinduâArabic_numeral_system and the rules for the use of its operations,
in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first
millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western_world via Islamic
mathematics. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the
modern definition of sine and cosine, and an early form of infinite_series.
A page from al-KhwÄrizmÄ«'s Algebra
During the Golden_Age_of_Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries,
mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The
most notable achievement of Islamic_mathematics was the development of algebra.
Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in spherical
trigonometry and the addition of the decimal_point to the Arabic numeral
system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as Al-
Khwarismi, Omar_Khayyam and Sharaf_al-DÄ«n_al-á¹¬Å«sÄ«.
During the early_modern_period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating
pace in Western_Europe. The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz in
the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. Leonhard_Euler was the most
notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and
discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the
German mathematician Carl_Friedrich_Gauss, who made numerous contributions to
fields such as algebra, analysis, differential_geometry, matrix_theory, number
theory, and statistics. In the early 20th century, Kurt_GÃ¶del transformed
mathematics by publishing his incompleteness_theorems, which show that any
axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.
Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful
interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both.
Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B.
Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin_of_the_American_Mathematical
Society, "The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical_Reviews
database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than
1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each
year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical
theorems and their proofs."[24]
**** Etymology ****
The word mathematics comes from Ancient_Greek Î¼Î¬Î¸Î·Î¼Î± (mÃ¡thÄma), meaning
"that which is learnt",[25] "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and
"science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more
technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.[26] Its
adjective is Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ (mathÄmatikÃ³s), meaning "related to
learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In
particular, Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹Îºá½´ ÏÎ­ÏÎ½Î· (mathÄmatiká¸ tÃ©khnÄ), Latin:
ars mathematica, meant "the mathematical art".
Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known
as the mathÄmatikoi (Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¿Î¯)âwhich at the time meant
"teachers" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.
In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly
meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the
meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has
resulted in several mistranslations. For example, Saint_Augustine's warning
that Christians should beware of mathematici, meaning astrologers, is sometimes
mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[27]
The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form les
mathÃ©matiques (and the less commonly used singular derivative la
mathÃ©matique), goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero),
based on the Greek plural Ïá½° Î¼Î±Î¸Î·Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¬ (ta mathÄmatikÃ¡), used
by Aristotle (384â322 BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical";
although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic
(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and
metaphysics, which were inherited from Greek.[28] In English, the noun
mathematics takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to maths or, in North
America, math.[29]
***** Definitions of mathematics *****
Main article: Definitions_of_mathematics
Leonardo_Fibonacci, the Italian mathematician who introduced the HinduâArabic
numeral_system invented between the 1st and 4th centuries by Indian
mathematicians, to the Western World
Mathematics has no_generally_accepted_definition.[6][7] Aristotle defined
mathematics as "the science of quantity" and this definition prevailed until
the 18th century.[30] In the 19th century, when the study of mathematics
increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as group_theory
and projective_geometry, which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and
measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new
definitions.[31] Three leading types of definition of mathematics today are
called logicist, intuitionist, and formalist, each reflecting a different
philosophical school of thought.[32] All have severe problems, none has
widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.[32]
An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was Benjamin_Peirce's "the
science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).[33] In the Principia
Mathematica, Bertrand_Russell and Alfred_North_Whitehead advanced the
philosophical program known as logicism, and attempted to prove that all
mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved
entirely in terms of symbolic_logic. A logicist definition of mathematics is
Russell's "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic" (1903).[34]
Intuitionist definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician L._E.
J._Brouwer, identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of
an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which
consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."[32] A peculiarity of
intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid
according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of
mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot
be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can
actually construct.
Formalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for
operating on them. Haskell_Curry defined mathematics simply as "the science of
formal systems".[35] A formal_system is a set of symbols, or tokens, and some
rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas. In formal systems,
the word axiom has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of "a
self-evident truth". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens
that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using
the rules of the system.
A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of
mathematics, or consider it undefinable.[6] There is not even consensus on
whether mathematics is an art or a science.[7] Some just say, "Mathematics is
what mathematicians do."[6]
**** Mathematics as science ****
Carl_Friedrich_Gauss, known as the prince of mathematicians
The German mathematician Carl_Friedrich_Gauss referred to mathematics as "the
Queen of the Sciences".[36] More recently, Marcus_du_Sautoy has called
mathematics "the Queen of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific
discovery".[37] In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, as well as in German
KÃ¶nigin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science means a "field
of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of "science" in English, also;
mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization
restricting the meaning of "science" to natural_science follows the rise of
Baconian_science, which contrasted "natural science" to scholasticism, the
Aristotelean_method of inquiring from first_principles. The role of empirical
experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics,[opinion] compared
to natural sciences such as biology, chemistry, or physics. Albert_Einstein
stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not
certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."[38]
Some modern philosophers consider that mathematics is not a science, and refer
to Karl_Popper for that.[39] However, Karl Popper himself concluded that "most
mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-
deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the
natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even
recently."[40]
Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences,
notably the exploration_of_the_logical_consequences of assumptions. Intuition
and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both
mathematics and the (other) sciences. Experimental_mathematics continues to
grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are
playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.
The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians
[41] feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of
its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal_arts;
others[who?] feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a
blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its
applications in science and engineering has driven much development in
mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the
philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) or
discovered (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into
sections that include a division of Science and Mathematics, indicating that
the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice,
mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but
separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the
philosophy_of_mathematics.[citation_needed]
***** Inspiration, pure and applied mathematics, and aesthetics *****
Main article: Mathematical_beauty
[Isaac_Newton]
[Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz]
Isaac_Newton (left) and Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz developed infinitesimal
calculus.
Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were
found in commerce, land_measurement, architecture and later astronomy; today,
all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems
arise within mathematics itself. For example, the physicist Richard_Feynman
invented the path_integral_formulation of quantum_mechanics using a combination
of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's string_theory, a
still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental
forces_of_nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.[42]
Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied
to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one
area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical
concepts. A distinction is often made between pure_mathematics and applied
mathematics. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have
applications, e.g. number_theory in cryptography. This remarkable fact, that
even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications,
is what Eugene_Wigner has called "the_unreasonable_effectiveness_of
mathematics".[12] As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the
scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized
areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics_Subject_Classification runs to
46 pages.[43] Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related
traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right,
including statistics, operations_research, and computer_science.
For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic
aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the elegance of
mathematics, its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty. Simplicity and
generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant proof, such as
Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime_numbers, and in an elegant
numerical_method that speeds calculation, such as the fast_Fourier_transform.
G._H._Hardy in A_Mathematician's_Apology expressed the belief that these
aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of
pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness,
inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical
aesthetic.[44] Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a
mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a characterization of the object by
these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory
mathematical arguments has been published in Proofs_from_THE_BOOK.
The popularity of recreational_mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many
find in solving mathematical questions. And at the other social extreme,
philosophers continue to find problems in philosophy_of_mathematics, such as
the nature of mathematical_proof.[45]
***** Notation, language, and rigor *****
Main article: Mathematical_notation
Leonhard_Euler created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used
today.
Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th
century.[46] Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting
mathematical discovery.[47] Euler (1707â1783) was responsible for many of the
notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the
professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to Barbara
Oakley, this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both
more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language.[48] Unlike
natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as cow) with the
physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking
any physical analog.[49] Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted
than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different
operations or ideas.[50]
Mathematical_language can be difficult to understand for beginners because even
common terms, such as or and only, have a more precise meaning than they have
in everyday speech, and other terms such as open and field refer to specific
mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical
language also includes many technical terms such as homeomorphism and
integrable that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand
phrases such as iff for "if_and_only_if" belong to mathematical_jargon. There
is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires
more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of
language and logic as "rigor".
Mathematical_proof is fundamentally a matter of rigor. Mathematicians want
their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is
to avoid mistaken "theorems", based on fallible intuitions, of which many
instances have occurred in the history of the subject.[b] The level of rigor
expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed
arguments, but at the time of Isaac_Newton the methods employed were less
rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a
resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century.
Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of
mathematics. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about
computer-assisted_proofs. Since large computations are hard to verify, such
proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous.[c][51] On
the other hand, proof_assistants allow verifying all details that cannot be
given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long
proofs such as that of FeitâThompson_theorem.[d]
Axioms in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception
is problematic.[52] At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols,
which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of
an axiomatic_system. It was the goal of Hilbert's_program to put all of
mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to GÃ¶del's_incompleteness
theorem every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has undecidable
formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible.
Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content)
nothing but set_theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every
mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.
[53]
***** Fields of mathematics *****
See also: Areas_of_mathematics and Glossary_of_areas_of_mathematics
The abacus is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity,
structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and
analysis). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions
dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to
logic, to set_theory (foundations), to the empirical mathematics of the various
sciences (applied_mathematics), and more recently to the rigorous study of
uncertainty. While some areas might seem unrelated, the Langlands_program has
found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois
groups, Riemann_surfaces and number_theory.
**** Foundations and philosophy ****
In order to clarify the foundations_of_mathematics, the fields of mathematical
logic and set_theory were developed. Mathematical logic includes the
mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas
of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or
collections of objects. Category_theory, which deals in an abstract way with
mathematical_structures and relationships between them, is still in
development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a
rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to
1930.[54] Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to
the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of
controversies at the time, including the controversy_over_Cantor's_set_theory
and the BrouwerâHilbert_controversy.
Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous
axiomatic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As
such, it is home to GÃ¶del's_incompleteness_theorems which (informally) imply
that any effective formal_system that contains basic arithmetic, if sound
(meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily
incomplete (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved in that
system). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a
foundation, GÃ¶del showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true
number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms.
Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory.
Modern logic is divided into recursion_theory, model_theory, and proof_theory,
and is closely linked to theoretical_computer_science,[citation_needed] as well
as to category_theory. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of
a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a
consequence_of_the_MRDP_theorem.
Theoretical_computer_science includes computability_theory, computational
complexity_theory, and information_theory. Computability theory examines the
limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most
well-known model â the Turing_machine. Complexity theory is the study of
tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by
computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is
likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of
computer hardware. A famous problem is the "P_=_NP?" problem, one of the
Millennium_Prize_Problems.[55] Finally, information theory is concerned with
the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with
concepts such as compression and entropy.

*** Quantity ***
Main article: Arithmetic
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural_numbers
and integers ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are
characterized in arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in
number_theory, from which come such popular results as Fermat's_Last_Theorem.
The twin_prime conjecture and Goldbach's_conjecture are two unsolved problems
in number theory.
As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a
subset of the rational_numbers ("fractions"). These, in turn, are contained
within the real_numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities.
Real numbers are generalized to complex_numbers. These are the first steps of a
hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions.
Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite_numbers,
which formalize the concept of "infinity". According to the fundamental_theorem
of_algebra all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients
are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of
sets, which is described with the cardinal_numbers. These include the aleph
numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large
sets.

*** Structure ***
Main article: Algebra
Many mathematical objects, such as sets of numbers and functions, exhibit
internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that are defined
on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be
expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number_theory studies
properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic
operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets
(or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a
further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and
then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus
one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such
studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain
of abstract_algebra.
By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly
unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning
compass_and_straightedge_constructions were finally solved using Galois_theory,
which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic
theory is linear_algebra, which is the general study of vector_spaces, whose
elements called vectors have both quantity and direction, and can be used to
model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the
phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have
very strong interactions in modern mathematics. Combinatorics studies ways of
enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

*** Space ***
Main article: Geometry
The study of space originates with geometry â in particular, Euclidean
geometry, which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known
Pythagorean_theorem. Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with
relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the
trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to
include higher-dimensional geometry, non-Euclidean_geometries (which play a
central role in general_relativity) and topology. Quantity and space both play
a role in analytic_geometry, differential_geometry, and algebraic_geometry.
Convex and discrete_geometry were developed to solve problems in number_theory
and functional_analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in
optimization and computer_science. Within differential geometry are the
concepts of fiber_bundles and calculus on manifolds, in particular, vector and
tensor_calculus. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric
objects as solution sets of polynomial equations, combining the concepts of
quantity and space, and also the study of topological_groups, which combine
structure and space. Lie_groups are used to study space, structure, and change.
Topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area
in 20th-century mathematics; it includes point-set_topology, set-theoretic
topology, algebraic_topology and differential_topology. In particular,
instances of modern-day topology are metrizability_theory, axiomatic_set
theory, homotopy_theory, and Morse_theory. Topology also includes the now
solved PoincarÃ©_conjecture, and the still unsolved areas of the Hodge
conjecture. Other results in geometry and topology, including the four_color
theorem and Kepler_conjecture, have been proved only with the help of
computers.

*** Change ***
Main article: Calculus
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural_sciences,
and calculus was developed as a tool to investigate it. Functions arise here,
as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of real
numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real_analysis, with
complex_analysis the equivalent field for the complex_numbers. Functional
analysis focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) spaces of
functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is quantum
mechanics. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and
its rate of change, and these are studied as differential_equations. Many
phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical_systems; chaos_theory makes
precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still
deterministic behavior.

**** Applied mathematics ****
Main article: Applied_mathematics
Applied_mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are
typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied
mathematics" is a mathematical_science with specialized knowledge. The term
applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which
mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical
problems, applied mathematics focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of
mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical
practice.
In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of
mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure
mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus,
the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure
mathematics.
*** Statistics and other decision sciences ***
Main article: Statistics
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics,
whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with probability_theory.
Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes
sense" with random_sampling and with randomized experiments;[56] the design of
a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before
the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or
when analyzing data from observational_studies, statisticians "make sense of
the data" using the art of modelling and the theory of inference â with model
selection and estimation; the estimated models and consequential predictions
should be tested on new_data.[e]
Statistical_theory studies decision_problems such as minimizing the risk
(expected_loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for
example, parameter_estimation, hypothesis_testing, and selecting_the_best. In
these traditional areas of mathematical_statistics, a statistical-decision
problem is formulated by minimizing an objective_function, like expected loss
or cost, under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often
involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level
of confidence.[57] Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory
of statistics shares concerns with other decision_sciences, such as operations
research, control_theory, and mathematical_economics.[58]
*** Computational mathematics ***
Computational_mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving mathematical
problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. Numerical
analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional_analysis and
approximation_theory; numerical analysis includes the study of approximation
and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding_errors. Numerical
analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics
of mathematical science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph_theory. Other
areas of computational mathematics include computer_algebra and symbolic
computation.

***** Mathematical awards *****
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields_Medal,[59][60]
established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II)
to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a
mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.
The Wolf_Prize_in_Mathematics, instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime
achievement, and another major international award, the Abel_Prize, was
instituted in 2003. The Chern_Medal was introduced in 2010 to recognize
lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a
particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an
outstanding problem in an established field.
A famous list of 23 open_problems, called "Hilbert's_problems", was compiled in
1900 by German mathematician David_Hilbert. This list achieved great celebrity
among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A
new list of seven important problems, titled the "Millennium_Prize_Problems",
was published in 2000. Only one of them, the Riemann_hypothesis, duplicates one
of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a $1 million
reward.

      statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a
      degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.
