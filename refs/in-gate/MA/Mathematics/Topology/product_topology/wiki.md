In topology and related areas of mathematics, a product space is the Cartesian
product of a family of topological_spaces equipped with a natural_topology
called the product topology. This topology differs from another, perhaps more
obvious, topology called the box_topology, which can also be given to a product
space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only
finitely many spaces. However, the product topology is "correct" in that it
makes the product space a categorical_product of its factors, whereas the box
topology is too_fine; this is the sense in which the product topology is
"natural".

***** Definition[edit] *****
Given X such that
         X :=  &#x220F;  i &#x2208; I    X  i     {\displaystyle X:=\prod _
      {i\in I}X_{i}}  [X:=\prod _{{i\in I}}X_{i}]
is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces Xi, indexed by     i
&#x2208; I   {\displaystyle i\in I}  [i\in I], and the canonical_projections
pi : X → Xi, the product topology on X is defined to be the coarsest_topology
(i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections pi
are continuous. The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff
topology.
The open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets
of the form      &#x220F;  i &#x2208; I    U  i     {\displaystyle \prod _{i\in
I}U_{i}}  [\prod _{i\in I}U_{i}], where each Ui is open in Xi and Ui â  Xi for
only finitely many i. In particular, for a finite product (in particular, for
the product of two topological spaces), the set of all Cartesian products
between one basis element from each Xi gives a basis for the product topology
of      &#x220F;  i &#x2208; I    X  i     {\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}}
[\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}]. That is, for a finite product, the set of all
&#x220F;  i &#x2208; I    U  i     {\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}U_{i}}  [\prod
_{i\in I}U_{i}], where      U  i     {\displaystyle U_{i}}  [U_{i}] is an
element of the (chosen) basis of      X  i     {\displaystyle X_{i}}  [X_{i}],
is a basis for the product topology of      &#x220F;  i &#x2208; I    X  i
{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}}  [\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}].
The product topology on X is the topology generated by sets of the form pi−1
(Ui), where i is in I and Ui is an open subset of Xi. In other words, the sets
{pi−1(Ui)} form a subbase for the topology on X. A subset of X is open if and
only if it is a (possibly infinite) union of intersections of finitely many
sets of the form pi−1(Ui). The pi−1(Ui) are sometimes called open_cylinders,
and their intersections are cylinder_sets.
In general, the product of the topologies of each Xi forms a basis for what is
called the box_topology on X. In general, the box topology is finer than the
product topology, but for finite products they coincide.
***** Examples[edit] *****
If one starts with the standard_topology on the real_line R and defines a
topology on the product of n copies of R in this fashion, one obtains the
ordinary Euclidean_topology on Rn.
The Cantor_set is homeomorphic to the product of countably_many copies of the
discrete_space {0,1} and the space of irrational_numbers is homeomorphic to the
product of countably many copies of the natural_numbers, where again each copy
carries the discrete topology.
Several additional examples are given in the article on the initial_topology.
***** Properties[edit] *****
The product space X, together with the canonical projections, can be
characterized by the following universal_property: If Y is a topological space,
and for every i in I, fi : Y → Xi is a continuous map, then there exists
precisely one continuous map f : Y → X such that for each i in I the following
diagram commutes:
[Characteristic_property_of_product_spaces]
This shows that the product space is a product in the category_of_topological
spaces. It follows from the above universal property that a map f : Y → X is
continuous if_and_only_if fi = pi o f is continuous for all i in I. In many
cases it is easier to check that the component functions fi are continuous.
Checking whether a map f : Y → X is continuous is usually more difficult; one
tries to use the fact that the pi are continuous in some way.
In addition to being continuous, the canonical projections pi : X → Xi are open
maps. This means that any open subset of the product space remains open when
projected down to the Xi. The converse is not true: if W is a subspace of the
product space whose projections down to all the Xi are open, then W need not be
open in X. (Consider for instance W = R2 \ (0,1)2.) The canonical projections
are not generally closed_maps (consider for example the closed set     { ( x ,
y ) &#x2208;   R   2   &#x2223; x y = 1 } ,   {\displaystyle \{(x,y)\in \mathbb
{R} ^{2}\mid xy=1\},}  [\{(x,y)\in {\mathbb  {R}}^{2}\mid xy=1\},] whose
projections onto both axes are R \ {0}).
The product topology is also called the topology of pointwise convergence
because of the following fact: a sequence (or net) in X converges if and only
if all its projections to the spaces Xi converge. In particular, if one
considers the space X = RI of all real valued functions on I, convergence in
the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions.
Any product of closed subsets of Xi is a closed set in X.
An important theorem about the product topology is Tychonoff's_theorem: any
product of compact_spaces is compact. This is easy to show for finite products,
while the general statement is equivalent to the axiom_of_choice.
***** Relation to other topological notions[edit] *****
    * Separation
          o Every product of T0_spaces is T0
          o Every product of T1_spaces is T1
          o Every product of Hausdorff_spaces is Hausdorff[1]
          o Every product of regular_spaces is regular
          o Every product of Tychonoff_spaces is Tychonoff
          o A product of normal_spaces need not be normal
    * Compactness
          o Every product of compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's_theorem)
          o A product of locally_compact_spaces need not be locally compact.
            However, an arbitrary product of locally compact spaces where all
            but finitely many are compact is locally compact (This condition is
            sufficient and necessary).
    * Connectedness
          o Every product of connected (resp. path-connected) spaces is
            connected (resp. path-connected)
          o Every product of hereditarily disconnected spaces is hereditarily
            disconnected.
    * Metric spaces
          o Countable products of metric_spaces are metrizable
***** Axiom of choice[edit] *****
The axiom_of_choice is equivalent to the statement that the product of a
collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. The proof is easy enough: one needs
only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product.
Conversely, a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one
element from each component.
The axiom of choice occurs again in the study of (topological) product spaces;
for example, Tychonoff's_theorem on compact sets is a more complex and subtle
example of a statement that is equivalent to the axiom of choice.
