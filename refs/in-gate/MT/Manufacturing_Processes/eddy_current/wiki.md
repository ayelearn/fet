For the comic-book series, see Eddy_Current_(comics).
Eddy currents (also called Foucault's currents) are loops of electrical_current
induced within conductors by a changing magnetic_field in the conductor
according to Faraday's_law_of_induction. Eddy currents flow in closed loops
within conductors, in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They can be
induced within nearby stationary conductors by a time-varying magnetic field
created by an AC electromagnet or transformer, for example, or by relative
motion between a magnet and a nearby conductor. The magnitude of the current in
a given loop is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of
the loop, and the rate of change of flux, and inversely proportional to the
resistivity of the material. When graphed, these circular currents within a
piece of metal look vaguely like eddies or whirlpools in a liquid.
By Lenz's_law, an eddy current creates a magnetic field that opposes the change
in the magnetic field that created it, and thus eddy currents react back on the
source of the magnetic field. For example, a nearby conductive surface will
exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion, due to eddy
currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field. This effect is
employed in eddy_current_brakes which are used to stop rotating power tools
quickly when they are turned off. The current flowing through the resistance of
the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material. Thus eddy
currents are a cause of energy loss in alternating current (AC) inductors,
transformers, electric_motors and generators, and other AC machinery, requiring
special construction such as laminated_magnetic_cores or ferrite_cores to
minimize them. Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in induction_heating
furnaces and equipment, and to detect cracks and flaws in metal parts using
eddy-current_testing instruments.

***** Origin of term[edit] *****
The term eddy current comes from analogous currents seen in water in fluid
dynamics, causing localised areas of turbulence known as eddies giving rise to
persistent vortices. Somewhat analogously, eddy currents can take time to build
up and can persist for very short times in conductors due to their inductance.
***** History[edit] *****
The first person to observe eddy currents was FranÃ§ois_Arago (1786â1853),
the 25th Prime Minister of France, who was also a mathematician, physicist and
astronomer. In 1824 he observed what has been called rotatory magnetism, and
that most conductive bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were
completed and explained by Michael_Faraday (1791â1867).
In 1834, Heinrich_Lenz stated Lenz's_law, which says that the direction of
induced current flow in an object will be such that its magnetic field will
oppose the change of magnetic flux that caused the current flow. Eddy currents
produce a secondary field that cancels a part of the external field and causes
some of the external flux to avoid the conductor.
French physicist LÃ©on_Foucault (1819â1868) is credited with having
discovered eddy currents. In September, 1855, he discovered that the force
required for the rotation of a copper disc becomes greater when it is made to
rotate with its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disc at the same time
becoming heated by the eddy current induced in the metal. The first use of eddy
current for non-destructive testing occurred in 1879 when David_E._Hughes used
the principles to conduct metallurgical sorting tests.
***** Explanation[edit] *****
Eddy currents (I, red) induced in a conductive metal plate (C) as it moves to
right under a magnet (N). The magnetic field (B, green) is directed down
through the plate. The increasing field at the leading edge of the magnet
(left) induces a counterclockwise current, which by Lenz's_law creates its own
magnetic field (left blue arrow) directed up, which opposes the magnet's field,
producing a retarding force. Similarly, at the trailing edge of the magnet
(right), a clockwise current and downward counterfield is created (right blue
arrow) also producing a retarding force.
Eddy current brake. The North magnetic pole piece (top) in this drawing is
shown further away from the disk than the South; this is just to leave room to
show the currents. In an actual eddy current brake the pole pieces are
positioned as close to the disk as possible.
A magnet induces circular electric_currents in a metal sheet moving through its
magnetic field. See the diagram at right. It shows a metal sheet (C) moving to
the right under a stationary magnet. The magnetic field (B, green arrows) of
the magnet's north pole N passes down through the sheet. Since the metal is
moving, the magnetic_flux through a given area of the sheet is changing. In the
part of the sheet moving under the leading edge of the magnet (left side) the
magnetic field through a given point on the sheet is increasing as it gets
nearer the magnet,        d B   d t     >  0   {\displaystyle {dB \over
dt}\;>\;0}  [{\displaystyle {dB \over dt}\;>\;0}]. From Faraday's_law_of
induction, this creates a circular electric_field in the sheet in a
counterclockwise direction around the magnetic field lines. This field induces
a counterclockwise flow of electric current (I, red), in the sheet. This is the
eddy current. In the part of the sheet under the trailing edge of the magnet
(right side) the magnetic field through a given point on the sheet is
decreasing as it is moving further away from the magnet,        d B   d t     <
0   {\displaystyle {dB \over dt}\;<\;0}  [{\displaystyle {dB \over dt}\;<\;0}],
inducing a second eddy current in a clockwise direction in the sheet.
Another equivalent way to understand the current is to see that the free charge
carriers (electrons) in the metal sheet are moving with the sheet to the right,
so the magnetic field exerts a sideways force on them due to the Lorentz_force.
Since the velocity v of the charges is to the right and the magnetic field B is
directed down, from the right_hand_rule the Lorentz force on positive charges F
= q(v Ã B) is toward the rear of the diagram (to the left when facing in the
direction of motion v). This causes a current I toward the rear under the
magnet, which circles around through parts of the sheet outside the magnetic
field, clockwise to the right and counterclockwise to the left, to the front of
the magnet again. The mobile charge_carriers in the metal, the electrons,
actually have a negative charge (q < 0) so their motion is opposite in
direction to the conventional_current shown.
Due to Ampere's_circuital_law each of these circular currents creates a counter
magnetic field (blue arrows), which due to Lenz's_law opposes the change in
magnetic field which caused it, exerting a drag force on the sheet. At the
leading edge of the magnet (left side) by the right_hand_rule the
counterclockwise current creates a magnetic field pointed up, opposing the
magnet's field, causing a repulsive force between the sheet and the leading
edge of the magnet. In contrast, at the trailing edge (right side), the
clockwise current causes a magnetic field pointed down, in the same direction
as the magnet's field, creating an attractive force between the sheet and the
trailing edge of the magnet. Both of these forces oppose the motion of the
sheet. The kinetic_energy which is consumed overcoming this drag force is
dissipated as heat by the currents flowing through the resistance of the metal,
so the metal gets warm under the magnet.
***** Properties[edit] *****
Eddy currents in conductors of non-zero resistivity generate heat as well as
electromagnetic forces. The heat can be used for induction_heating. The
electromagnetic forces can be used for levitation, creating movement, or to
give a strong braking effect. Eddy currents can also have undesirable effects,
for instance power loss in transformers. In this application, they are
minimized with thin plates, by lamination of conductors or other details of
conductor shape.
Self-induced eddy currents are responsible for the skin_effect in conductors.
[1] The latter can be used for non-destructive testing of materials for
geometry features, like micro-cracks.[2] A similar effect is the proximity
effect, which is caused by externally induced eddy currents.[3]
An object or part of an object experiences steady field intensity and direction
where there is still relative motion of the field and the object (for example
in the center of the field in the diagram), or unsteady fields where the
currents cannot circulate due to the geometry of the conductor. In these
situations charges collect on or within the object and these charges then
produce static electric potentials that oppose any further current. Currents
may be initially associated with the creation of static potentials, but these
may be transitory and small.
(left) Eddy currents (I, red) within a solid iron transformer core. (right)
Making the core out of thin laminations parallel to the field (B, green) with
insulation between them reduces the eddy currents. Although the field and
currents are shown in one direction, they actually reverse direction with the
alternating current in the transformer winding.
Eddy currents generate resistive losses that transform some forms of energy,
such as kinetic energy, into heat. This Joule_heating reduces efficiency of
iron-core transformers and electric_motors and other devices that use changing
magnetic fields. Eddy currents are minimized in these devices by selecting
magnetic_core materials that have low electrical conductivity (e.g., ferrites)
or by using thin sheets of magnetic material, known as laminations. Electrons
cannot cross the insulating gap between the laminations and so are unable to
circulate on wide arcs. Charges gather at the lamination boundaries, in a
process analogous to the Hall_effect, producing electric fields that oppose any
further accumulation of charge and hence suppressing the eddy currents. The
shorter the distance between adjacent laminations (i.e., the greater the number
of laminations per unit area, perpendicular to the applied field), the greater
the suppression of eddy currents.
The conversion of input energy to heat is not always undesirable, however, as
there are some practical applications. One is in the brakes of some trains
known as eddy_current_brakes. During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a
magnetic field from an electromagnet, generating eddy currents in the wheels.
This eddy current is formed by the movement of the wheels. So, by Lenz's_law,
the magnetic field formed by the Eddy current will oppose its cause. Thus the
wheel will face a force opposing the initial movement of the wheel. The faster
the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as the train
slows the braking force is reduced, producing a smooth stopping motion.
Induction_heating makes use of eddy currents to provide heating of metal
objects.
**** Power dissipation of eddy currents[edit] ****
Under certain assumptions (uniform material, uniform magnetic field, no skin
effect, etc.) the power lost due to eddy currents per unit mass for a thin
sheet or wire can be calculated from the following equation:[4]
         P =     &#x03C0;  2    B  p    2    d  2    f  2     6 k &#x03C1; D
      ,   {\displaystyle P={\frac {\pi ^{2}B_{\text{p}}^{\,2}d^{2}f^{2}}{6k\rho
      D}},}  [P={\frac {\pi ^{2}B_{\text{p}}^{\,2}d^{2}f^{2}}{6k\rho D}},]
where
      P is the power lost per unit mass (W/kg),
      Bp is the peak magnetic field (T),
      d is the thickness of the sheet or diameter of the wire (m),
      f is the frequency (Hz),
      k is a constant equal to 1 for a thin sheet and 2 for a thin wire,
      Ï is the resistivity of the material (Î© m), and
      D is the density of the material (kg/m3).
This equation is valid only under the so-called quasi-static conditions, where
the frequency of magnetisation does not result in the skin_effect; that is, the
electromagnetic wave fully penetrates the material.
**** Skin effect[edit] ****
Main article: Skin_effect
In very fast-changing fields, the magnetic field does not penetrate completely
into the interior of the material. This skin effect renders the above equation
invalid. However, in any case increased frequency of the same value of field
will always increase eddy currents, even with non-uniform field penetration.
[citation_needed]
The penetration depth for a good conductor can be calculated from the following
equation:[5]
         &#x03B4; =   1  &#x03C0; f &#x03BC; &#x03C3;    ,   {\displaystyle
      \delta ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {\pi f\mu \sigma }}},}  [\delta ={\frac {1}
      {\sqrt {\pi f\mu \sigma }}},]
where Î´ is the penetration depth (m), f is the frequency (Hz), Î¼ is the
magnetic_permeability of the material (H/m), and Ï is the electrical
conductivity of the material (S/m).
**** Diffusion equation[edit] ****
The derivation of a useful equation for modelling the effect of eddy currents
in a material starts with the differential, magnetostatic form of AmpÃ¨re's
Law,[6] providing an expression for the magnetizing_field H surrounding a
current density J:
         &#x2207; &#x00D7;  H  =  J  .   {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf
      {H} =\mathbf {J} .}  [\nabla \times \mathbf {H} =\mathbf {J} .]
Taking the curl on both sides of this equation and then using a common vector
calculus identity for the curl_of_the_curl results in
           &#x2212;   &#x2207;  (  &#x2207; &#x22C5;  H   )  &#x2212;  &#x2207;
      2    H  = &#x2207; &#x00D7;  J  .   {\displaystyle {\color {white}-
      }\nabla \left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {H} \right)-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {H}
      =\nabla \times \mathbf {J} .}  [{\color {white}-}\nabla \left(\nabla
      \cdot \mathbf {H} \right)-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {H} =\nabla \times \mathbf
      {J} .]
From Gauss's_law_for_magnetism, â · H = 0, so
         &#x2212;  &#x2207;  2    H  = &#x2207; &#x00D7;  J  .   {\displaystyle
      -\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {H} =\nabla \times \mathbf {J} .}  [-\nabla ^
      {2}\mathbf {H} =\nabla \times \mathbf {J} .]
Using Ohm's_law, J = ÏE, which relates current density J to electric field E
in terms of a material's conductivity Ï, and assuming isotropic homogeneous
conductivity, the equation can be written as
         &#x2212;  &#x2207;  2    H  = &#x03C3; &#x2207; &#x00D7;  E  .
      {\displaystyle -\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {H} =\sigma \nabla \times {\boldsymbol
      {E}}.}  [-\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {H} =\sigma \nabla \times {\boldsymbol
      {E}}.]
Using the differential form of Faraday's_law, â × E = ââB/ât, this
gives
           &#x2212;    &#x2207;  2    H  = &#x03C3;    &#x2202;  B    &#x2202;
      t    .   {\displaystyle {\color {white}-}\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {H} =\sigma
      {\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}.}  [{\color {white}-}\nabla ^
      {2}\mathbf {H} =\sigma {\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}.]
By definition, B = Î¼0(H + M), where M is the magnetization of the material and
Î¼0 is the vacuum_permeability. The diffusion equation therefore is
           &#x2212;    &#x2207;  2    H  =  &#x03BC;  0   &#x03C3;
      (     &#x2202;  M    &#x2202; t    +    &#x2202;  H    &#x2202; t     )
      .   {\displaystyle {\color {white}-}\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {H} =\mu _
      {0}\sigma \left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {M} }{\partial t}}+{\frac
      {\partial \mathbf {H} }{\partial t}}\right).}  [{\color {white}-}\nabla ^
      {2}\mathbf {H} =\mu _{0}\sigma \left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {M} }
      {\partial t}}+{\frac {\partial \mathbf {H} }{\partial t}}\right).]
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Electromagnetic braking[edit] ****

[File:20. ÐÐ°Ð»ÑÐµÐ½ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÐ½Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ Ð¿ÑÐ°Ð²Ð¸Ð»Ð¾.ogv]Play_media
Demonstration of Waltenhofenâs pendulum, precursor of eddy current brakes.
The formation and suppression of eddy_currents is here demonstrated by means of
this pendulum, a metal plate oscillating between the pole pieces of a strong
electromagnet. As soon as a sufficiently strong magnetic field has been
switched on, the pendulum is stopped on entering the field.
Eddy_current_brakes use the drag force created by eddy currents as a brake to
slow or stop moving objects. Since there is no contact with a brake shoe or
drum, there is no mechanical wear. However, an eddy current brake cannot
provide a "holding" torque and so may be used in combination with mechanical
brakes, for example, on overhead cranes. Another application is on some roller
coasters, where heavy copper plates extending from the car are moved between
pairs of very strong permanent magnets. Electrical_resistance within the plates
causes a dragging effect analogous to friction, which dissipates the kinetic
energy of the car. The same technique is used in electromagnetic brakes in
railroad cars and to quickly stop the blades in power tools such as circular
saws. Using electromagnets, as opposed to permanent magnets, the strength of
the magnetic field can be adjusted and so the magnitude of braking effect
changed.
**** Repulsive effects and levitation[edit] ****
Main article: electrodynamic_suspension
A cross section through a linear motor placed above a thick aluminium slab. As
the linear_induction_motor's field pattern sweeps to the left, eddy currents
are left behind in the metal and this causes the field lines to lean.
In a varying magnetic field the induced currents exhibit diamagnetic-like
repulsion effects. A conductive object will experience a repulsion force. This
can lift objects against gravity, though with continual power input to replace
the energy dissipated by the eddy currents. An example application is
separation of aluminum_cans from other metals in an eddy_current_separator.
Ferrous metals cling to the magnet, and aluminum (and other non-ferrous
conductors) are forced away from the magnet; this can separate a waste stream
into ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal.
With a very strong handheld magnet, such as those made from neodymium, one can
easily observe a very similar effect by rapidly sweeping the magnet over a coin
with only a small separation. Depending on the strength of the magnet, identity
of the coin, and separation between the magnet and coin, one may induce the
coin to be pushed slightly ahead of the magnet â even if the coin contains no
magnetic elements, such as the US penny. Another example involves dropping a
strong magnet down a tube of copper[7] â the magnet falls at a dramatically
slow pace.
In a perfect conductor with no resistance (a superconductor), surface eddy
currents exactly cancel the field inside the conductor, so no magnetic field
penetrates the conductor. Since no energy is lost in resistance, eddy currents
created when a magnet is brought near the conductor persist even after the
magnet is stationary, and can exactly balance the force of gravity, allowing
magnetic_levitation. Superconductors also exhibit a separate inherently quantum
mechanical phenomenon called the Meissner_effect in which any magnetic field
lines present in the material when it becomes superconducting are expelled,
thus the magnetic field in a superconductor is always zero.
Using electromagnets with electronic switching comparable to electronic_speed
control it is possible to generate electromagnetic fields moving in an
arbitrary direction. As described in the section above about eddy current
brakes, a non-ferromagnetic conductor surface tends to rest within this moving
field. When however this field is moving, a vehicle can be levitated and
propelled. This is comparable to a maglev but is not bound to a rail.[8]
**** Identification of metals[edit] ****
In a coin-operated vending_machine, eddy currents are used to detect
counterfeit coins, or slugs. The coin rolls past a stationary magnet, and eddy
currents slow its speed. The strength of the eddy currents, and thus the
retardation, depends on the conductivity of the coin's metal. Slugs are slowed
to a different degree than genuine coins, and this is used to send them into
the rejection slot.
**** Vibration and position sensing[edit] ****
Eddy currents are used in certain types of proximity_sensors to observe the
vibration and position of rotating shafts within their bearings. This
technology was originally pioneered in the 1930s by researchers at General
Electric using vacuum tube circuitry. In the late 1950s, solid-state versions
were developed by Donald_E._Bently at Bently_Nevada Corporation. These sensors
are extremely sensitive to very small displacements making them well suited to
observe the minute vibrations (on the order of several thousandths of an inch)
in modern turbomachinery. A typical proximity sensor used for vibration
monitoring has a scale factor of 200 mV/mil. Widespread use of such sensors in
turbomachinery has led to development of industry standards that prescribe
their use and application. Examples of such standards are American_Petroleum
Institute (API) Standard 670 and ISO 7919.
A Ferraris acceleration sensor, also called a Ferraris_sensor, is a contactless
sensor that uses eddy currents to measure relative acceleration.[9][10][11]
**** Structural testing[edit] ****
Eddy current techniques are commonly used for the nondestructive_examination
(NDE) and condition monitoring of a large variety of metallic structures,
including heat_exchanger tubes, aircraft fuselage, and aircraft structural
components.
**** Skin effects[edit] ****
Eddy currents are the root cause of the skin_effect in conductors carrying AC
current.
Lamination of magnetic cores in transformers greatly improves the efficiency by
minimising eddy currents
Similarly, in magnetic materials of finite conductivity eddy currents cause the
confinement of the majority of the magnetic fields to only a couple skin_depths
of the surface of the material. This effect limits the flux_linkage in
inductors and transformers having magnetic_cores.
