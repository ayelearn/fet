Zinc is a chemical_element with the symbol Zn and atomic number 30. Zinc is a
slightly brittle metal at room_temperature and has a blue-silvery appearance
when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group_12 of the periodic
table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements
exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of
similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element_in_Earth's_crust and has
five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a
zinc_sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and
the United States. Zinc is refined by froth_flotation of the ore, roasting, and
final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).
Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as
the third millennium BC in the Aegean, Iraq, the United_Arab_Emirates,
Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia, and the second millennium BC in West_India,
Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel/Palestine.[3][4][5] Zinc metal was
not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was
known to the ancient Romans and Greeks.[6] The mines of Rajasthan have given
definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC.[7] To
date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early
as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure
zinc.[8] Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called "philosopher's
wool" or "white snow".
The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German
word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas_Sigismund_Marggraf is
credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi_Galvani and
Alessandro_Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800.
Corrosion-resistant zinc_plating of iron (hot-dip_galvanizing) is the major
application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small
non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds
are commonly used, such as zinc_carbonate and zinc_gluconate (as dietary
supplements), zinc_chloride (in deodorants), zinc_pyrithione (anti-dandruff
shampoos), zinc_sulfide (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or
diethylzinc in the organic laboratory.
Zinc is an essential_mineral, including to prenatal and postnatal development.
[9] Zinc_deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world
and is associated with many diseases.[10] In children, deficiency causes growth
retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea.
[9] Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive_center are widespread in
biochemistry, such as alcohol_dehydrogenase in humans.[11]
Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper_deficiency.

***** Characteristics[edit] *****
**** Physical properties[edit] ****
Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal,[12] though most common
commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish.[13] It is somewhat less
dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal_structure, with a distorted form of
hexagonal_close_packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9
pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm.[14] The
metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between
100 and 150 Â°C.[12][13] Above 210 Â°C, the metal becomes brittle again and can
be pulverized by beating.[15] Zinc is a fair conductor_of_electricity.[12] For
a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 Â°C) and boiling points
(907 Â°C).[16] The melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside
from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and
mercury are often not considered to be transition_metals like the rest of the
d-block metals.[16]
Many alloys contain zinc, including brass. Other metals long known to form
binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead,
mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium, and sodium.[17]
Although neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy ZrZn
2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 K.[12]
A bar of zinc generates a characteristic sound when bent, similar to tin_cry.
**** Occurrence[edit] ****
See also: Zinc_minerals
Zinc makes up about 75 ppm (0.0075%) of Earth's_crust, making it the 24th most
abundant element. Soil contains zinc in 5â770 ppm with an average 64 ppm.
Seawater has only 30 ppb and the atmosphere, 0.1â4 Âµg/m3.[18] The element is
normally found in association with other base_metals such as copper and lead in
ores.[19] Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element is more likely to be found
in minerals together with sulfur and other heavy chalcogens, rather than with
the light chalcogen oxygen or with non-chalcogen electronegative elements such
as the halogens. Sulfides formed as the crust solidified under the reducing
conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere.[20] Sphalerite, which is a form of
zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its
concentrate contains 60â62% zinc.[19]
Other source minerals for zinc include smithsonite (zinc carbonate),
hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), and sometimes
hydrozincite (basic zinc_carbonate).[21] With the exception of wurtzite, all
these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides.
[20]
Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9â2.8 billion tonnes.[22][23]
Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, with the largest
reserves in Iran.[20][24][25] The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc
(meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and
production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt.[26]
Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose
suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and
quantity) at the time of determination. Since exploration and mine development
is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and
sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating
the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by
data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that
although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the
reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have
been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that
about 109â305 million tonnes are in use.[27][28][29]

**** Isotopes[edit] ****
Main article: Isotopes_of_zinc
Five stable isotopes of zinc occur in nature, with 64Zn being the most abundant
isotope (49.17% natural_abundance).[30][31] The other isotopes found in nature
are 66
Zn (27.73%), 67
Zn (4.04%), 68
Zn (18.45%), and 70
Zn (0.61%).[31] The most abundant isotope 64Zn and the rare 70Zn are
theoretically unstable on energetic grounds, though their predicted half-lives
exceed 4.3Ã1018 years[32] and 1.3Ã1016 years,[31] meaning that their
radioactivity could be ignored for practical purposes.
Several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized. 65
Zn, which has a half-life of 243.66 days, is the least active radioisotope,
followed by 72
Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours.[30] Zinc has 10 nuclear_isomers. 69mZn has
the longest half-life, 13.76 h.[30] The superscript m indicates a metastable
isotope. The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited_state and will
return to the ground_state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma_ray. 61
Zn has three excited metastable states and 73
Zn has two.[33] The isotopes 65
Zn, 71
Zn, 77
Zn and 78
Zn each have only one excited metastable state.[30]
The most common decay_mode of a radioisotope of zinc with a mass_number lower
than 66 is electron_capture. The decay_product resulting from electron capture
is an isotope of copper.[30]

**** Reactivity[edit] ****
See also: Clemmensen_reduction
Zinc has an electron_configuration of [Ar]3d104s2 and is a member of the group
12 of the periodic_table. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing
agent.[34] The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming
a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc_carbonate, Zn
5(OH)
6(CO3)
2, by reaction with atmospheric carbon_dioxide.[35] This layer helps prevent
further reaction with air and water.
Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc
oxide.[36] Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals.[37]
Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room_temperature with acids.[36]
Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric_acid, can remove the passivating
layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.[36]
The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state. When compounds in
this oxidation state are formed, the outer shell s electrons are lost, yielding
a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d10.[38] In aqueous
solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H
2O)6]2+
 is the predominant species.[39] The volatilization of zinc in combination with
zinc chloride at temperatures above 285 Â°C indicates the formation of Zn
2Cl
2, a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state.[36] No compounds of zinc in
oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known.[40] Calculations indicate that
a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist.[41]
Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition
metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are
diamagnetic and mostly colorless.[42] The ionic_radii of zinc and magnesium
happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts
have the same crystal_structure,[43] and in other circumstances where ionic
radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with
that of magnesium.[36] In other respects, there is little similarity with the
late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater
degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors.[42]
Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate
complexes are known.[36]
**** Zinc(I) compounds[edit] ****
Zinc(I) compounds are rare and need bulky ligands to stabilize the low
oxidation state. Most zinc(I) compounds contain formally the [Zn2]2+ core,
which is analogous to the [Hg2]2+ dimeric cation present in mercury(I)
compounds. The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure.
The first zinc(I) compound containing the ZnâZn bond, (Î·5-C5Me5)2Zn2, is
also the first dimetallocene. The [Zn2]2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into
zinc metal and zinc(II), and has been obtained only a yellow glass only by
cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2.[44]

nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions, but is amphoteric, dissolving in
both strong basic and acidic solutions.[36] The other chalcogenides (ZnS, ZnSe,

***** History[edit] *****
**** Ancient use[edit] ****
[Large_black_bowl-shaped_bucket_on_a_stand._The_bucket_has_incrustation_around

Late Roman brass bucket â the Hemmoorer Eimer from Warstade, Germany, second
to third century AD
Various isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been
discovered. Zinc ores were used to make the zincâcopper alloy brass thousands
of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element. Judean brass
from the 14th to 10th centuries BC contains 23% zinc.[4]
Knowledge of how to produce brass spread to Ancient_Greece by the
7th century BC, but few varieties were made.[5] Ornaments made of alloys
containing 80â90% zinc, with lead, iron, antimony, and other metals making up
the remainder, have been found that are 2,500 years old.[19] A possibly
prehistoric statuette containing 87.5% zinc was found in a Dacian
archaeological site.[54]
The oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates hydrozincite and
smithsonite. The pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard the Roman
ship Relitto_del_Pozzino, wrecked in 140 BC.[55][56]
The manufacture of brass was known to the Romans by about 30 BC.[57] They made
brass by heating powdered calamine (zinc silicate or carbonate), charcoal and
copper together in a crucible.[57] The resulting calamine_brass was then either
cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry.[58] Some coins struck by
Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass.[59]
Strabo writing in the 1st century BC (but quoting a now lost work of the 4th
century BC historian Theopompus) mentions "drops of false silver" which when
mixed with copper make brass. This may refer to small quantities of zinc that
is a by-product of smelting sulfide ores.[60] Zinc in such remnants in smelting
ovens was usually discarded as it was thought to be worthless.[61]
The Berne_zinc_tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman_Gaul made of an alloy
that is mostly zinc.[62]
The Charaka_Samhita, thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD,[63]
mentions a metal which, when oxidized, produces pushpanjan, thought to be zinc
oxide.[64] Zinc mines at Zawar, near Udaipur in India, have been active since
the Mauryan_period (c.  322 and 187 BCE). The smelting of metallic zinc here,
however, appears to have begun around the 12th century AD.[65][66] One estimate
is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and
zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries.[21] Another estimate gives a total
production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period.[65] The
Rasaratna_Samuccaya, written in approximately the 13th century AD, mentions two
types of zinc-containing ores: one used for metal extraction and another used
for medicinal purposes.[66]
**** Early studies and naming[edit] ****
Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of Yasada or
Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka
dynasty) and written about the year 1374.[67] Smelting and extraction of impure
zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was
accomplished in the 13th century in India.[12][68] The Chinese did not learn of
the technique until the 17th century.[68]
Various alchemical_symbols for the element zinc
Alchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a
condenser. Some alchemists called this zinc oxide lana philosophica, Latin for
"philosopher's wool", because it collected in wooly tufts, whereas others
thought it looked like white snow and named it nix album.[69]
The name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus, a Swiss-born
German alchemist, who referred to the metal as "zincum" or "zinken" in his book
Liber Mineralium II, in the 16th century.[68][70] The word is probably derived
from the German zinke, and supposedly meant "tooth-like, pointed or jagged"
(metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance).[71] Zink could also
imply "tin-like" because of its relation to German zinn meaning tin.[72] Yet
another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word Ø³ÙÚ¯
seng meaning stone.[73] The metal was also called Indian tin, tutanego,
calamine, and spinter.[19]
German metallurgist Andreas_Libavius received a quantity of what he called
"calay" of Malabar from a cargo ship captured from the Portuguese in 1596.[74]
Libavius described the properties of the sample, which may have been zinc. Zinc
was regularly imported to Europe from the Orient in the 17th and early 18th
centuries,[68] but was at times very expensive.[note_1]
[Picture_of_an_old_man_head_(profile)._The_man_has_a_long_face,_short_hair_and

Andreas_Sigismund_Marggraf is given credit for first isolating pure zinc
**** Isolation[edit] ****
Metallic zinc was isolated in India by 1300 AD,[75][76][77] much earlier than
in the West. Before it was isolated in Europe, it was imported from India in
about 1600 CE.[78] Postlewayt's Universal Dictionary, a contemporary source
giving technological information in Europe, did not mention zinc before 1751
but the element was studied before then.[66][79]
Flemish metallurgist and alchemist P._M._de_Respour reported that he had
extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668.[21] By the start of the 18th
century, Ãtienne_FranÃ§ois_Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as
yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted.
[21] In Britain, John_Lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt
zinc, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.[80]
In 1738 in Great Britain, William_Champion patented a process to extract zinc
from calamine in a vertical retort-style smelter.[81] His technique resembled
that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests he visited
the Orient.[78] Champion's process was used through 1851.[68]
German chemist Andreas_Marggraf normally gets credit for discovering pure
metallic zinc, even though Swedish chemist Anton von Swab had distilled zinc
from calamine four years previously.[68] In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf
heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to
obtain a metal.[61] This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.[82]
**** Later work[edit] ****
[Painting_of_a_middle-aged_man_sitting_by_the_table,_wearing_a_wig,_black
jacket,_white_shirt_and_white_scarf.]
Galvanization was named after Luigi_Galvani.
William Champion's brother, John, patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc
sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process.[19] Prior to this, only
calamine could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, Johann_Christian_Ruberg
improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort
smelter.[83] Jean-Jacques_Daniel_Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc
smelter in Belgium that processed even more zinc.[68] Italian doctor Luigi
Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal_cord of a freshly
dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg
to twitch.[84] He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves
and muscles to create electricity and called the effect "animal_electricity".
[85] The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for
Luigi Galvani, and his discoveries paved the way for electrical_batteries,
galvanization, and cathodic_protection.[85]
Galvani's friend, Alessandro_Volta, continued researching the effect and
invented the Voltaic_pile in 1800.[84] The basic unit of Volta's pile was a
simplified galvanic_cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an
electrolyte and connected by a conductor externally. The units were stacked in
series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing
electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.[84]
The non-magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed
discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition.[86] This changed in
1940 when carbonic_anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood,
was shown to have zinc in its active_site.[86] The digestive enzyme
carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.[86]

Zinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only iron, aluminium, and
copper with an annual production of about 13 million tonnes.[22] The world's
largest zinc producer is Nyrstar, a merger of the Australian OZ_Minerals and
the Belgian Umicore.[88] About 70% of the world's zinc originates from mining,
while the remaining 30% comes from recycling secondary zinc.[89] Commercially
pure zinc is known as Special High Grade, often abbreviated SHG, and is 99.995%
pure.[90]
Worldwide, 95% of new zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which
sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and
iron.[91] Zinc mines are scattered throughout the world, with the main areas
being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38% of the global zinc output
in 2014.[22]
Zinc metal is produced using extractive_metallurgy.[92] The ore is finely
ground, then put through froth_flotation to separate minerals from gangue (on
the property of hydrophobicity), to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate[92]
consisting of about 50% zinc, 32% sulfur, 13% iron, and 5% SiO
2.[92]
Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate to zinc oxide:[91]
      2 ZnS + 3 O
      2 â 2 ZnO + 2 SO
      2
The sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid, which is
necessary for the leaching process. If deposits of zinc carbonate, zinc
silicate, or zinc spinel (like the Skorpion_Deposit in Namibia) are used for
zinc production, the roasting can be omitted.[93]
For further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or
electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon
monoxide at 950 Â°C (1,740 Â°F) into the metal, which is distilled as zinc
vapor to separate it from other metals, which are not volatile at those
temperatures.[94] The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser.[91] The equations
below describe this process:[91]
      2 ZnO + C â 2 Zn + CO
      2
      ZnO + CO â Zn + CO
      2
In electrowinning, zinc is leached from the ore concentrate by sulfuric_acid:
[95]
      ZnO + H
      2SO
      4 â ZnSO
      4 + H
      2O
Finally, the zinc is reduced by electrolysis.[91]
      2 ZnSO
      4 + 2 H
      2O â 2 Zn + 2 H
      2SO
      4 + O
      2
The sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching step.
When galvanised feedstock is fed to an electric_arc_furnace, the zinc is
recovered from the dust by a number of processes, predominately the Waelz
process (90% as of 2014).[96]
**** Environmental impact[edit] ****
Refinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and
cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities
of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of
lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La_Calamine and PlombiÃ¨res
between 1806 and 1882.[97] The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc
and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul_River contain non-trivial amounts of
metals.[97] About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and
smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850,
zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined
to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic
troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline.
Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1.[98]
Zinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as
20 ppm.[99] Effective sewage_treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along
the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50 ppb.[99] Concentrations
of zinc as low as 2 ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can
carry in their blood.[100]
[A_panorama_featuring_a_large_industrial_plant_on_a_sea_side,_in_front_of
mountains.]
Historically responsible for high metal levels in the Derwent_River,[101] the
zinc works at Lutana is the largest exporter in Tasmania, generating 2.5% of
the state's GDP, and producing more than 250,000 tonnes of zinc per year.[102]
Soils_contaminated with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-
bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil.
Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of
plants to absorb other essential_metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc
levels of 2000 ppm to 180,000 ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil
samples.[99]
***** Applications[edit] *****
Major applications of zinc include (numbers are given for the US)[103]
   1. Galvanizing (55%)
   2. Brass and bronze (16%)
   3. Other alloys (21%)
   4. Miscellaneous (8%)
**** Anti-corrosion and batteries[edit] ****
[Merged_elongated_crystals_of_various_shades_of_gray.]
Hot-dip handrail galvanized crystalline surface
Zinc is most commonly used as an anti-corrosion agent,[104] and galvanization
(coating of iron or steel) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United
States, 55% or 893,000 tons of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.[103]
Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local
oxidation until it completely corrodes away.[105] A protective surface layer of
oxide and carbonate (Zn
5(OH)
6(CO
3)
2) forms as the zinc corrodes.[106] This protection lasts even after the zinc
layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away.[106]
The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip_galvanizing
or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails,
suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.
[18]
The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself
makes it an efficient sacrificial_anode in cathodic_protection (CP). For
example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting
anodes made from zinc to the pipe.[106] Zinc acts as the anode (negative
terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel
pipeline.[106][note_2] Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that
are exposed to sea water.[107] A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder
will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact.[105] Similarly, a zinc plug
attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship
provides temporary protection.
With a standard_electrode_potential (SEP) of â0.76 volts, zinc is used as an
anode material for batteries. (More reactive lithium (SEP â3.04 V) is used
for anodes in lithium_batteries ). Powdered zinc is used in this way in
alkaline_batteries and the case (which also serves as the anode) of
zincâcarbon_batteries is formed from sheet zinc.[108][109] Zinc is used as
the anode or fuel of the zinc-air_battery/fuel cell.[110][111][112] The zinc-
cerium redox_flow_battery also relies on a zinc-based negative half-cell.[113]
**** Alloys[edit] ****
A widely used zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere
from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass.[106] Brass is generally
more ductile and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion_resistance.
[106] These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware,
musical instruments, and water valves.[106]
[A_mosaica_pattern_composed_of_components_having_various_shapes_and_shades_of

Cast brass microstructure at magnification 400x
Other widely used zinc alloys include nickel_silver, typewriter metal, soft and
aluminium solder, and commercial bronze.[12] Zinc is also used in contemporary
pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes.[114]
Alloys of 85â88% zinc, 4â10% copper, and 2â8% aluminium find limited use
in certain types of machine bearings. Zinc is the primary metal in American_one
cent_coins (pennies) since 1982.[115] The zinc core is coated with a thin layer
of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin. In 1994, 33,200 tonnes
(36,600 short tons) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the
United States.[116]
Alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are
useful in die_casting as well as spin_casting, especially in the automotive,
electrical, and hardware industries.[12] These alloys are marketed under the
name Zamak.[117] An example of this is zinc_aluminium. The low melting point
together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of
small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling
of the cast products and fast production for assembly.[12][118] Another alloy,
marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and
is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic.[12]
[119] This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts
made of ceramics and cement.[12]
Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled
into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping
dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be
too expensive.[120] For building facades, roofing, and other applications for
sheet_metal formed by deep_drawing, roll_forming, or bending, zinc alloys with
titanium and copper are used.[121] Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these
manufacturing processes.[121]
As a dense, inexpensive, easily worked material, zinc is used as a lead
replacement. In the wake of lead_concerns, zinc appears in weights for various
applications ranging from fishing[122] to tire_balances and flywheels.[123]
Cadmium_zinc_telluride (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy that can be divided into
an array of small sensing devices.[124] These devices are similar to an
integrated_circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma_ray photons.
[124] When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the
direction of the rays.[124]
**** Other industrial uses[edit] ****
[White_powder_on_a_glass_plate]
Zinc oxide is used as a white pigment in paints.
Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was
consumed in zinc compounds;[103] a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc
oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in the
manufacture of rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber
polymers and plastics from ultraviolet_radiation (UV).[18] The semiconductor
properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products.
[125] The zinc_zinc-oxide_cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on
zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen_production.[126]
Zinc_chloride is often added to lumber as a fire_retardant[127] and sometimes
as a wood preservative.[128] It is used in the manufacture of other chemicals.
[127] Zinc_methyl (Zn(CH3)
2) is used in a number of organic syntheses.[129] Zinc_sulfide (ZnS) is used in
luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television
screens, and luminous_paints.[130] Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that
operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum.[131] Zinc_sulfate is a
chemical in dyes and pigments.[127] Zinc_pyrithione is used in antifouling
paints.[132]
Zinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model_rockets.[133] When a
compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a
violent chemical reaction.[133] This produces zinc sulfide, together with large
amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.[133]
Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars.[134]
64
Zn, the most abundant isotope of zinc, is very susceptible to neutron
activation, being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65
Zn, which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma_radiation.
Because of this, zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent
is depleted of 64
Zn before use, this is called depleted_zinc_oxide. For the same reason, zinc
has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear_weapons (cobalt is another,
better-known salting material).[135] A jacket of isotopically_enriched 64
Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an
exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a large amount of 65
Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's fallout.[135]
Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used.[135]
65
Zn is used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out, or the
path and the role of zinc in organisms.[136]
Zinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural fungicides; these
include Zineb, Metiram, Propineb and Ziram.[137] Zinc naphthenate is used as
wood preservative.[138] Zinc in the form of ZDDP, is used as an anti-wear
additive for metal parts in engine oil.[139]
**** Organic chemistry[edit] ****
Addition of diphenylzinc to an aldehyde
Organozinc chemistry is the science of compounds that contain carbon-zinc
bonds, describing the physical properties, synthesis, and chemical
reactions.Many organozinc compounds are important.[140][141][142][143] Among
important applications are
    * The Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester (ROCOCOOR) reacts
      with an alkyl_halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric_acid to form the Î±-
      hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR[144]
    * The Reformatskii_reaction in which Î±-halo-esters and aldehydes are
      converted to Î²-hydroxy-esters
    * The SimmonsâSmith_reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc
      iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane
    * The Addition_reaction of organozinc compounds to form carbonyl compounds
    * The Barbier_reaction (1899), which is the zinc equivalent of the
      magnesium Grignard_reaction and is the better of the two. In presence of
      water, formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the
      Barbier reaction can take place in water.
    * On the downside, organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards,
      and they are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available
      diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In
      one study,[145][146] the active organozinc compound is obtained from much
      cheaper organobromine precursors
    * The Negishi_coupling is also an important reaction for the formation of
      new carbon-carbon bonds between unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes,
      arenes and alkynes. The catalysts are nickel and palladium. A key step in
      the catalytic_cycle is a transmetalation in which a zinc halide exchanges
      its organic substituent for another halogen with the palladium (nickel)
      metal center.
    * The Fukuyama_coupling is another coupling reaction, but it uses a
      thioester as reactant and produces a ketone.
Zinc has found many applications as a catalyst in organic synthesis including
asymmetric synthesis, being cheap and easily available alternative to precious
metal complexes. The results (yield and enantiomeric_excess) obtained with
chiral zinc catalysts are comparable to those achieved with palladium,
ruthenium, iridium and others, and zinc becomes a metal catalyst of choice.

**** Dietary supplement[edit] ****
GNC zinc 50 mg tablets. The amount exceeds what is deemed the safe upper limit

Zinc_gluconate is one compound used for the delivery of zinc as a dietary
supplement.
See also: Zinc_sulfate_(medical_use)
In most single-tablet, over-the-counter, daily vitamin and mineral supplements,
zinc is included in such forms as zinc_oxide, zinc_acetate, or zinc_gluconate.
[148] Zinc is generally considered to be an antioxidant. However, it is redox
inert and thus can serve such a function only indirectly.[149] Generally, zinc
supplement is recommended where there is high risk of zinc deficiency (such as
low and middle income countries) as a preventive measure.[150]
Zinc deficiency has been associated with major_depressive_disorder (MDD), and
zinc supplements may be an effective treatment.[151]
Zinc serves as a simple, inexpensive, and critical tool for treating diarrheal
episodes among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the
body during diarrhea, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a
10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of
diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for as long as three
months.[152]
A Cochrane review stated that people taking zinc supplement may be less likely
to progress to age-related_macular_degeneration.[153]
Zinc supplement is an effective treatment for acrodermatitis_enteropathica, a
genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to
affected infants.[57]
Gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc, possibly by direct
antimicrobial action of the ions in the gastrointestinal_tract, or by the
absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes
secrete zinc), or both.[154][155]
In 2011, researchers reported that adding large amounts of zinc to a urine
sample masked detection of drugs. The researchers did not test whether orally
consuming a zinc dietary supplement could have the same effect.[156]
Zinc is a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA_receptor.[157]
*** Common cold[edit] ***
This section is transcluded from Zinc_and_the_common_cold. (edit | history)
Zinc supplements (frequently zinc_acetate or zinc_gluconate lozenges) are a
group of dietary_supplements that are commonly used for the treatment of the
common_cold.[158] The use of zinc supplements at doses in excess of 75 mg/day
within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms has been shown to reduce the duration
of cold symptoms by about 1 day.[158][159] Due to a lack of data, there is
insufficient evidence to determine whether the preventative_use of zinc
supplements reduces the likelihood of contracting a cold.[159] Adverse effects
with zinc supplements by_mouth include bad taste and nausea.[158][159] The
intranasal_use of zinc-containing nasal_sprays has been associated with the
loss_of_the_sense_of_smell;[158] consequently, in June 2009, the United_States
Food_and_Drug_Administration (USFDA) warned consumers to stop using intranasal
zinc products.[158]
The human_rhinovirus â the most common viral_pathogen in humans â is the
predominant cause of the common cold.[160] The hypothesized mechanism_of_action
by which zinc reduces the severity and/or duration of cold symptoms is the
suppression of nasal inflammation and the direct inhibition of rhinoviral
receptor_binding and rhinoviral replication in the nasal_mucosa.[158]
**** Topical use[edit] ****
Further information: Zinc_oxide_Â§ Medicine
Topical_preparations of zinc include those used on the skin, often in the form
of zinc_oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against sunburn in the summer and
windburn in the winter.[57] Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (perineum)
with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper_rash.[57]
Chelated zinc is used in toothpastes and mouthwashes to prevent bad_breath.
[161]
Zinc_pyrithione is widely included in shampoos to prevent dandruff.[162]
***** Biological role[edit] *****
Zinc is an essential trace_element for humans[163][164][165] and other animals,
[166] for plants[98] and for microorganisms.[167] Zinc is required for the
function of over 300 enzymes and 1000 transcription_factors,[165] and is stored
and transferred in metallothioneins.[168][169] It is the second most abundant
trace metal in humans after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all
enzyme_classes.[98][165]
In proteins, zinc ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of
aspartic_acid, glutamic_acid, cysteine and histidine. The theoretical and
computational description of this zinc binding in proteins (as well as that of
other transition metals) is difficult.[170]
Roughly 2â4 grams of zinc[171] are distributed throughout the human body.
Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest
concentrations in the prostate and parts of the eye.[172] Semen is particularly
rich in zinc, a key factor in prostate_gland function and reproductive_organ
growth.[173]
Zinc homeostasis of the body is mainly controlled by the intestine. Here, ZIP4
and especially TRPM7 were linked to intestinal zinc uptake essential for
postnatal survival.[174][175]
In humans, the biological roles of zinc are ubiquitous.[9][164] It interacts
with "a wide range of organic ligands",[9] and has roles in the metabolism of
RNA and DNA, signal_transduction, and gene_expression. It also regulates
apoptosis. A 2006 study estimated that about 10% of human proteins (2800)
potentially bind zinc, in addition to hundreds more that transport and traffic
zinc; a similar in_silico study in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana found 2367
zinc-related proteins.[98]
In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic_vesicles by glutamatergic
neurons and can modulate neuronal excitability.[164][165][176] It plays a key
role in synaptic_plasticity and so in learning.[164][177] Zinc homeostasis also
plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the central_nervous
system.[164][176][165] Dysregulation of zinc homeostasis in the central nervous
system that results in excessive synaptic zinc concentrations is believed to
induce neurotoxicity through mitochondrial oxidative stress (e.g., by
disrupting certain enzymes involved in the electron_transport_chain, including
complex_I, complex_III, and Î±-ketoglutarate_dehydrogenase), the dysregulation
of calcium homeostasis, glutamatergic neuronal excitotoxicity, and interference
with intraneuronal signal_transduction.[164][178] L- and D-histidine facilitate
brain zinc uptake.[179] SLC30A3 is the primary zinc_transporter involved in
cerebral zinc homeostasis.[164]

Zinc_fingers help read DNA sequences.
Zinc is an efficient Lewis_acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in
hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions.[180] The metal also has a flexible
coordination_geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift
conformations to perform biological reactions.[181] Two examples of zinc-
containing enzymes are carbonic_anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital
to the processes of carbon_dioxide (CO
2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.[182]
In vertebrate blood, carbonic anhydrase converts CO
2 into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into CO
2 for exhalation through the lungs.[183] Without this enzyme, this conversion
would occur about one million times slower[184] at the normal blood pH of 7 or
would require a pH of 10 or more.[185] The non-related Î²-carbonic anhydrase is
required in plants for leaf formation, the synthesis of indole acetic_acid
(auxin) and alcoholic_fermentation.[186]
Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A
coordinate_covalent_bond is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group
attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This helps to
create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the
non-polar part of the protein being digested.[182]
**** Signalling[edit] ****
Zinc has been recognized as a messenger, able to activate signalling pathways.
Many of these pathways provide the driving force in aberrant cancer growth.
They can be targeted through ZIP_transporters.[187]
**** Other proteins[edit] ****
Zinc serves a purely structural role in zinc_fingers, twists and clusters.[188]
Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription_factors, which are proteins that
recognize DNA_base_sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA.
Each of the nine or ten Zn2+
 ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger's structure by coordinately
binding to four amino_acids in the transcription factor.[184] The transcription
factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to
the DNA sequence.
In blood_plasma, zinc is bound to and transported by albumin (60%, low-
affinity) and transferrin (10%).[171] Because transferrin also transports iron,
excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism
exists with copper.[189] The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays
relatively constant regardless of zinc intake.[180] Cells in the salivary
gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc_signaling to communicate
with other cells.[190]
Zinc may be held in metallothionein reserves within microorganisms or in the
intestines or liver of animals.[191] Metallothionein in intestinal cells is
capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15â40%.[192] However, inadequate
or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess zinc particularly impairs
copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals.[193]
The human dopamine_transporter contains a high_affinity extracellular zinc
binding_site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies
amphetamine-induced dopamine_efflux in_vitro.[194][195][196] The human
serotonin_transporter and norepinephrine_transporter do not contain zinc
binding sites.[196] Some EF-hand calcium_binding_proteins such as S100 or NCS-
1 are also able to bind zinc ions.[197]
**** Dietary recommendations[edit] ****
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements
(EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for zinc in 2001. The current
EARs for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up is 6.8 and 9.4 mg/day,
respectively. The RDAs are 8 and 11 mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to
identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements.
RDA for pregnancy is 11 mg/day. RDA for lactation is 12 mg/day. For infants up
to 12 months the RDA is 3 mg/day. For children ages 1â13 years the RDA
increases with age from 3 to 8 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable
upper_intake_levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is
sufficient. In the case of zinc the adult UL is 40 mg/day (lower for children).
Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary_Reference
Intakes (DRIs).[180]
The European_Food_Safety_Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of
information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI)
instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined
the same as in United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations
are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the phytate
content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day
as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4
to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.[198] The EFSA
reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25 mg/day, which is much
lower than the U.S. value.[199]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving
is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For zinc labeling purposes 100%
of the Daily Value was 15 mg, but on May 27, 2016 it was revised to 11 mg.[200]
A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference_Daily
Intake. Food and supplement companies have until January 1, 2020 to comply with
the change.[201]
**** Dietary intake[edit] ****
[Several_plates_full_of_various_cereals,_fruits_and_vegetables_on_a_table.]
Foods_and_spices containing zinc
Animal products such as meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, and dairy contain
zinc. The concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil.
With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are
wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds, including sesame, poppy, alfalfa,
celery, and mustard.[202] Zinc is also found in beans, nuts, almonds, whole
grains, pumpkin_seeds, sunflower_seeds, and blackcurrant.[203] Plant phytates
are particularly found in pulses and cereals and interfere with zinc
absorption.
Other sources include fortified_food and dietary_supplements in various forms.
A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, one of the most common supplements in
the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed
in the body.[204] This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc
concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than
in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts.[204] For fortification,
however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap,
stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms.[205] A
2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate,
did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as
fortificants to maize tortillas.[206]
**** Deficiency[edit] ****
Main article: Zinc_deficiency
Nearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc. Groups
at risk include children in developing countries and elderly with chronic
illnesses.[10] In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and
contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year.[9] The
World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe
malnutrition and diarrhea.[207] Zinc supplements help prevent disease and
reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted
growth.[207] However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone,
because many in the developing world have several deficiencies, and zinc
interacts with other micronutrients.[208] While zinc deficiency is usually due
to insufficient dietary intake, it can be associated with malabsorption,
acrodermatitis_enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease,
sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses.[10]
In the United States, a federal survey of food consumption determined that for
women and men over the age of 19, average consumption was 9.7 and 14.2 mg/day,
respectively. For women, 17% consumed less than the EAR, for men 11%. The
percentages below EAR increased with age.[209] The most recent published update
of the survey (NHANES 2013â2014) reported lower averages â 9.3 and 13.2 mg/
day â again with intake decreasing with age.[210]
Symptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse.[180] Clinical outcomes include
depressed growth, diarrhea, impotence and delayed sexual maturation, alopecia,
eye and skin lesions, impaired appetite, altered cognition, impaired immune
functions, defects in carbohydrate utilization, and reproductive teratogenesis.
[180] Zinc deficiency depresses immunity,[211] but excessive zinc does also.
[171]
Despite some concerns,[212] western vegetarians and vegans do not suffer any
more from overt zinc deficiency than meat-eaters.[213] Major plant sources of
zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods,
nuts, peas, and seeds.[212] However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers
may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly
understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran,
can contribute to zinc malabsorption.[10] Some evidence suggests that more than
the US RDA (8 mg/day for adult women; 11 mg/day for adult men) may be needed in
those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians.[212] The
European_Food_Safety_Authority (EFSA) guidelines attempt to compensate for this
by recommending higher zinc intake when dietary phytate intake is greater.[198]
These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc
biomarkers, and the most widely used indicator, plasma zinc, has poor
sensitivity_and_specificity.[214]
**** Soil remediation[edit] ****
Species of Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in zinc-metalliferous soils,
because translocation of toxic ions is prevented by the action of ericoid
mycorrhizal_fungi.[215]
**** Agriculture[edit] ****
Zinc deficiency appears to be the most common micronutrient deficiency in crop
plants; it is particularly common in high-pH soils.[216] Zinc-deficient soil is
cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China,
and most of Western Australia. Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have
been reported in these areas.[98] Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-
deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily
through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel
combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc_phosphide),
limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces.
Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.
[98]
***** Precautions[edit] *****
Main article: Zinc_toxicity
**** Toxicity[edit] ****
Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be
harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption.
[193] The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates,
and even vertebrate fish.[217] The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established
in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills
some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia
in water.[218]
The free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis_acid up to the point of being corrosive.
Stomach acid contains hydrochloric_acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves
readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one
cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high
solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.[219]
Evidence shows that people taking 100â300 mg of zinc daily may suffer induced
copper_deficiency. A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily
were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a
placebo.[220] Levels of 100â300 mg may interfere with the utilization of
copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol.[193] Zinc in excess of 500 ppm
in soil interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals, such as
iron and manganese.[99] A condition called the zinc_shakes or "zinc chills" can
be induced by inhalation of zinc fumes while brazing or welding galvanized
materials.[130] Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain
between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram. Disability and even deaths from
excessive use of these products have been claimed.[221]
The U.S. Food_and_Drug_Administration (FDA) states that zinc damages nerve
receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also observed
in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent
polio infections.[222] On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based
intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can
be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking
gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.[223]
Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a
potent heat_shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with
induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and
melanocytes.[224]
**** Poisoning[edit] ****
In 1982, the US_Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing
primarily zinc. Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal.
One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1 kg of zinc)
resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another
patient who ingested 12 grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross
lack of coordination of muscle movements).[225] Several other cases have been
reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.
[226][227]
Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, requiring
veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can
cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic_anemia and
liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms.[228] Zinc
is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal.[229] The
consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass
parrot poisonings with zinc.[57]

 151. ^ In this one-pot_reaction bromobenzene is converted to phenyllithium by
      reaction with 4 equivalents of n-butyllithium, then transmetalation with
      zinc_chloride forms diphenylzinc that continues to react in an asymmetric
      reaction first with the MIB_ligand and then with 2-naphthylaldehyde to
      the alcohol. In this reaction formation of diphenylzinc is accompanied by
      that of lithium_chloride, which if unchecked, catalyses the reaction
      without MIB involvement to the racemic alcohol. The salt is effectively
      removed by chelation with tetraethylethylene_diamine (TEEDA) resulting in
      an enantiomeric_excess of 92%.

      (hDAT) contains an endogenous high affinity Zn2+ binding site with three
      coordinating residues on its extracellular face (His193, His375, and
      Glu396). ... Thus, when Zn2+ is co-released with glutamate, it may
      greatly augment the efflux of dopamine.
