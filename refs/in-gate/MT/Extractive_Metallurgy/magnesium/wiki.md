Magnesium is a chemical_element with the symbol Mg and atomic_number 12. It is
a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five
elements in the second column (group 2, or alkaline_earth_metals) of the
periodic_table: all group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in
the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.
Magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe.[10][11] It is
produced in large, aging stars from the sequential addition of three helium
nuclei to a carbon nucleus. When such stars explode as supernovas, much of the
magnesium is expelled into the interstellar_medium where it may recycle into
new star systems. Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's
crust[12] and the fourth most common element in the Earth (after iron, oxygen
and silicon), making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the
planet's mantle. It is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater,
after sodium and chlorine.[13]
Magnesium occurs naturally only in combination with other elements, where it
invariably has a +2 oxidation_state. The free element (metal) can be produced
artificially, and is highly reactive (though in the atmosphere, it is soon
coated in a thin layer of oxide that partly inhibits reactivity â see
passivation). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light.
The metal is now obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained
from brine, and is used primarily as a component in aluminium-magnesium alloys,
sometimes called magnalium or magnelium. Magnesium is less dense than
aluminium, and the alloy is prized for its combination of lightness and
strength.
Magnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human_body and
is essential to all cells and some 300 enzymes.[14] Magnesium ions interact
with polyphosphate compounds such as ATP, DNA, and RNA. Hundreds of enzymes
require magnesium ions to function. Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as
common laxatives, antacids (e.g., milk_of_magnesia), and to stabilize abnormal
nerve excitation or blood vessel spasm in such conditions as eclampsia.[14]

***** Characteristics *****
**** Physical properties ****
Elemental magnesium is a gray-white lightweight metal, two-thirds the density
of aluminium. Magnesium has the lowest melting (923 K (1,202 Â°F)) and the
lowest boiling point 1,363 K (1,994 Â°F) of all the alkaline earth metals.
Pure polycrystalline magnesium is brittle and easily fractures along shear
bands. It becomes much more ductile when alloyed with small amount of other
metals, such as 1% aluminium.[15] Ductility of polycrystalline magnesium can
also be significantly improved by reducing its grain size to ca. 1 micron or
less.[16]
**** Chemical properties ****
*** General chemistry ***
It tarnishes slightly when exposed to air, although, unlike the heavier
alkaline_earth_metals, an oxygen-free environment is unnecessary for storage
because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly
impermeable and difficult to remove.
Magnesium reacts with water at room temperature, though it reacts much more
slowly than calcium, a similar group 2 metal. When submerged in water, hydrogen
bubbles form slowly on the surface of the metal â though, if powdered, it
reacts much more rapidly. The reaction occurs faster with higher temperatures
(see safety_precautions). Magnesium's reversible reaction with water can be
harnessed to store energy and run a magnesium-based_engine. Magnesium also
reacts exothermically with most acids such as hydrochloric_acid (HCl),
producing the metal chloride and hydrogen gas, similar to the HCl reaction with
aluminium, zinc, and many other metals.
*** Flammability ***
Magnesium is highly flammable, especially when powdered or shaved into thin
strips, though it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk. Flame temperatures of
magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach 3,100 Â°C (5,610 Â°F),[17] although
flame height above the burning metal is usually less than 300 mm (12 in).[18]
Once ignited, such fires are difficult to extinguish, because combustion
continues in nitrogen (forming magnesium_nitride), carbon_dioxide (forming
magnesium_oxide and carbon), and water (forming magnesium oxide and hydrogen).
This property was used in incendiary weapons during the firebombing of cities
in World_War_II, where the only practical civil_defense was to smother a
burning flare under dry sand to exclude atmosphere from the combustion.
Magnesium may also be used as an igniter for thermite, a mixture of aluminium
and iron oxide powder that ignites only at a very high temperature.
*** Organic chemistry ***
Main article: Grignard_reagent
Organomagnesium compounds are widespread in organic_chemistry. They are
commonly found as Grignard_reagents. Magnesium can react with haloalkanes to
give Grignard_reagents. Examples of Grignard_reagents are phenylmagnesium
bromide and ethylmagnesium_bromide. The Grignard_reagents function as a common
nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic group such as the carbon atom that is
present within the polar bond of a carbonyl group.
A prominent organomagnesium reagent beyond Grignard reagents is magnesium
anthracene with magnesium forming a 1,4-bridge over the central ring. It is
used as a source of highly active magnesium. The related butadiene-magnesium
adduct serves as a source for the butadiene dianion.
*** Source of light ***
When burning in air, magnesium produces a brilliant-white light that includes
strong ultraviolet wavelengths. Magnesium powder (flash_powder) was used for
subject illumination in the early days of photography.[19][20] Later, magnesium
filament was used in electrically ignited single-use photography flashbulbs.
Magnesium powder is used in fireworks and marine flares where a brilliant white
light is required. It was also used for various theatrical effects,[21] such as
lightning,[22] pistol flashes,[23] and supernatural appearances.[24]
**** Occurrence ****
See also: Category:Magnesium_minerals.
See also: Boninite
Magnesium is the eighth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass and
tied in seventh place with iron in molarity.[12] It is found in large deposits
of magnesite, dolomite, and other minerals, and in mineral waters, where
magnesium ion is soluble.
Although magnesium is found in more than 60 minerals, only dolomite, magnesite,
brucite, carnallite, talc, and olivine are of commercial importance.
The Mg2+
 cation is the second-most-abundant cation in seawater (about â the mass of
sodium ions in a given sample), which makes seawater and sea salt attractive
commercial sources for Mg. To extract the magnesium, calcium_hydroxide is added
to seawater to form magnesium_hydroxide precipitate.

***** Forms *****
**** Alloys ****
Magnesium is brittle, and fractures along shear_bands when its thickness is
reduced by only 10% by cold_rolling (top). However, after alloying Mg with 1%
Al and 0.1% Ca, its thickness could be reduced by 54% using the same process
(bottom).
As of 2013, magnesium alloys consumption was less than one million tonnes per
year, compared with 50 million tonnes of aluminum_alloys. Their use has been
historically limited by the tendency of Mg alloys to corrode, creep at high
temperatures, and combust.[25]
*** Corrosion ***
The presence of iron, nickel, copper, and cobalt strongly activates corrosion.
Greater than a very small percentage, these metals precipitate as intermetallic
compounds, and the precipitate locales function as active cathodic sites that
reduce water, causing the loss of magnesium.[25] Controlling the quantity of
these metals improves corrosion resistance. Sufficient manganese overcomes the
corrosive effects of iron. This requires precise control over composition,
increasing costs.[25] Adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within
the structure of a metal. This prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas, an
essential factor of corrosive chemical processes. The addition of about one in
three hundred parts arsenic reduces its corrosion rate in a salt solution by a
factor of nearly ten.[25][26]
*** High-temperature creep and flammability ***
Research showed that magnesium's tendency to creep at high temperatures is
eliminated by the addition of scandium and gadolinium. Flammability is greatly
reduced by a small amount of calcium in the alloy.[25]
**** Compounds ****
Magnesium forms a variety of compounds important to industry and biology,
including magnesium_carbonate, magnesium_chloride, magnesium_citrate, magnesium
hydroxide (milk of magnesia), magnesium_oxide, magnesium_sulfate, and magnesium
sulfate heptahydrate (Epsom_salts).
**** Isotopes ****
Main article: Isotopes_of_magnesium
Magnesium has three stable isotopes: 24
Mg, 25
Mg and 26
Mg. All are present in significant amounts (see table of isotopes above). About
79% of Mg is 24
Mg. The isotope 28
Mg is radioactive and in the 1950s to 1970s was produced by several nuclear
power plants for use in scientific experiments. This isotope has a relatively
short half-life (21 hours) and its use was limited by shipping times.
The nuclide 26
Mg has found application in isotopic geology, similar to that of aluminium. 26
Mg is a radiogenic daughter product of
26
Al
, which has a half-life of 717,000 years. Excessive quantities of stable 26
Mg have been observed in the Ca-Al-rich_inclusions of some carbonaceous
chondrite meteorites. This anomalous abundance is attributed to the decay of
its parent 26
Al in the inclusions, and researchers conclude that such meteorites were formed
in the solar_nebula before the 26
Al had decayed. These are among the oldest objects in the solar_system and
contain preserved information about its early history.
It is conventional to plot 26
Mg/24
Mg against an Al/Mg ratio. In an isochron_dating plot, the Al/Mg ratio plotted
is27
Al/24
Mg. The slope of the isochron has no age significance, but indicates the
initial 26
Al/27
Al ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a
common reservoir.
***** Production *****

Magnesium sheets and ingots
World production was approximately 1,100 kt in 2017, with the bulk being
produced in China (930 kt) and Russia (60 kt).[27] China is almost completely
reliant on the silicothermic Pidgeon_process (the reduction of the oxide at
high temperatures with silicon, often provided by a ferrosilicon alloy in which
the iron is but a spectator in the reactions) to obtain the metal.[28] The
process can also be carried out with carbon at approx 2300 Â°C:

      (g)
In the United States, magnesium is obtained principally with the Dow_process,
by electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride from brine and sea_water. A saline
solution containing Mg2+
 ions is first treated with lime (calcium oxide) and the precipitated magnesium
hydroxide is collected:
      Mg2+
      (aq) + CaO
      (s) + H
      2O â Ca2+
      (aq) + Mg(OH)
      2(s)
The hydroxide is then converted to a partial hydrate of magnesium_chloride by
treating the hydroxide with hydrochloric_acid and heating of the product:
      Mg(OH)
      2(s) + 2 HCl â MgCl
      2(aq) + 2H
      2O
      (l)
The salt is then electrolyzed in the molten state. At the cathode, the Mg2+
 ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal:
      Mg2+
       + 2
      e−
       â Mg
At the anode, each pair of Clâ
 ions is oxidized to chlorine gas, releasing two electrons to complete the
circuit:
      2 Clâ
       â Cl
      2 (g) + 2
      e−
A new process, solid oxide membrane technology, involves the electrolytic
reduction of MgO. At the cathode, Mg2+
 ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal. The electrolyte is yttria-
stabilized_zirconia (YSZ). The anode is a liquid metal. At the YSZ/liquid metal
anode O2â
 is oxidized. A layer of graphite borders the liquid metal anode, and at this
interface carbon and oxygen react to form carbon monoxide. When silver is used
as the liquid metal anode, there is no reductant carbon or hydrogen needed, and
only oxygen gas is evolved at the anode.[29] It has been reported that this
method provides a 40% reduction in cost per pound over the electrolytic
reduction method.[30] This method is more environmentally sound than others
because there is much less carbon dioxide emitted.
The United States has traditionally been the major world supplier of this
metal, supplying 45% of world production even as recently as 1995. Today, the
US market share is at 7%, with a single domestic producer left, US Magnesium, a
Renco_Group company in Utah born from now-defunct Magcorp.[31]
***** History *****
The name magnesium originates from the Greek word for a district in Thessaly
called Magnesia.[32] It is related to magnetite and manganese, which also
originated from this area, and required differentiation as separate substances.
See manganese for this history.
In 1618, a farmer at Epsom in England attempted to give his cows water from a
well there. The cows refused to drink because of the water's bitter taste, but
the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes. The
substance became known as Epsom_salts and its fame spread.[33] It was
eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate, MgSO
4Â·7 H
2O.
The metal itself was first isolated by Sir_Humphry_Davy in England in 1808. He
used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and mercuric_oxide.[34] Antoine
Bussy prepared it in coherent form in 1831. Davy's first suggestion for a name
was magnium,[34] but the name magnesium is now used.
***** Uses as a metal *****
An unusual application of magnesium as an illumination source while wakeskating
in 1931
Magnesium is the third-most-commonly-used structural metal, following iron and
aluminium.[35] The main applications of magnesium are, in order: aluminium
alloys, die-casting (alloyed with zinc),[36] removing sulfur in the production
of iron and steel, and the production of titanium in the Kroll_process.[37]
Magnesium is used in super-strong, lightweight materials and alloys. For
example, when infused with silicon carbide nanoparticles, it has extremely high
specific strength.[38]
Historically, magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and
was used for German military aircraft as early as World War I and extensively
for German aircraft in World War II. The Germans coined the name "Elektron" for
magnesium alloy, a term which is still used today. In the commercial aerospace
industry, magnesium was generally restricted to engine-related components, due
to fire and corrosion hazards. Currently, magnesium alloy use in aerospace is
increasing, driven by the importance of fuel economy.[39] Development and
testing of new magnesium alloys continues, notably Elektron 21, which (in test)
has proved suitable for aerospace engine, internal, and airframe components.
[40] The European Community runs three R&D magnesium projects in the Aerospace
priority of Six Framework Program.
In the form of thin ribbons, magnesium is used to purify_solvents; for example,
preparing super-dry ethanol.
**** Aircraft ****
    * Wright_Aeronautical used a magnesium crankcase in the WWII-era Wright
      Duplex_Cyclone aviation engine. This presented a serious problem for the
      earliest models of the Boeing_B-29 heavy bomber when an in-flight engine
      fire ignited the engine crankcase. The resulting combustion was as hot as
      5,600 Â°F (3,100 Â°C) and could sever the wing spar from the fuselage.
      [41][42][43]
**** Automotive ****
Mg alloy motorcycle engine blocks
    * Mercedes-Benz used the alloy Elektron in the bodywork of an early model
      Mercedes-Benz_300_SLR; these cars competed in the 1955_World_Sportscar
      Championship including a win at the Mille_Miglia, and at Le_Mans where
      one was involved in the 1955_Le_Mans_disaster when spectators were
      showered with burning fragments of elektron.
    * Porsche used magnesium alloy frames in the 917/053 that won Le Mans in
      1971, and continues to use magnesium alloys for its engine blocks due to
      the weight advantage.
    * Volkswagen_Group has used magnesium in its engine components for many
      years.[citation_needed]
    * Mitsubishi_Motors uses magnesium for its paddle_shifters.
    * BMW used magnesium alloy blocks in their N52 engine, including an
      aluminium alloy insert for the cylinder walls and cooling jackets
      surrounded by a high-temperature magnesium alloy AJ62A. The engine was
      used worldwide between 2005 and 2011 in various 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 series
      models; as well as the Z4, X1, X3, and X5.
    * Chevrolet used the magnesium alloy AE44 in the 2006 Corvette Z06.
Both AJ62A and AE44 are recent developments in high-temperature low-creep
magnesium alloys. The general strategy for such alloys is to form intermetallic
precipitates at the grain_boundaries, for example by adding mischmetal or
calcium.[44] New alloy development and lower costs that make magnesium
competitive with aluminium will increase the number of automotive applications.
**** Electronics ****
Because of low weight and good mechanical and electrical properties, magnesium
is widely used for manufacturing of mobile phones, laptop and tablet_computers,
cameras, and other electronic components.
Products made of magnesium: firestarter and shavings, sharpener, magnesium
ribbon
**** Other ****
Magnesium, being readily available and relatively nontoxic, has a variety of
uses:
    * Magnesium is flammable, burning at a temperature of approximately
      3,100 Â°C (3,370 K; 5,610 Â°F),[17] and the autoignition_temperature of
      magnesium ribbon is approximately 473 Â°C (746 K; 883 Â°F).[45] It
      produces intense, bright, white light when it burns. Magnesium's high
      combustion temperature makes it a useful tool for starting emergency
      fires. Other uses include flash photography, flares, pyrotechnics, and
      fireworks sparklers. Magnesium is also often used to ignite thermite or
      other materials that require a high ignition temperature.
      Magnesium firestarter (in left hand), used with a pocket_knife and flint
      to create sparks that ignite the shavings
    * In the form of turnings or ribbons, to prepare Grignard_reagents, which
      are useful in organic_synthesis.
    * As an additive agent in conventional propellants and the production of
      nodular_graphite_in_cast_iron.
    * As a reducing agent to separate uranium and other metals from their
      salts.
    * As a sacrificial_(galvanic)_anode to protect boats, underground tanks,
      pipelines, buried structures, and water heaters.
    * Alloyed with zinc to produce the zinc sheet used in photoengraving plates
      in the printing industry, dry-cell_battery walls, and roofing.[36]
    * As a metal, this element's principal use is as an alloying additive to
      aluminium with these aluminium-magnesium alloys being used mainly for
      beverage_cans, sports equipment such as golf clubs, fishing reels, and
      archery bows and arrows.
    * Specialty, high-grade car wheels of magnesium alloy are called "mag
      wheels", although the term is often misapplied to aluminium wheels. Many
      car and aircraft manufacturers have made engine and body parts from
      magnesium.
    * Magnesium_batteries have been commercialized as primary_batteries, and
      are an active topic of research for rechargeable secondary_batteries.

Magnesium metal and its alloys can be explosive hazards; they are highly
flammable in their pure form when molten or in powder or ribbon form. Burning
or molten magnesium reacts violently with water. When working with powdered
magnesium, safety_glasses with eye_protection and UV filters (such as welders
use) are employed because burning magnesium produces ultraviolet light that can
permanently damage the retina of a human eye.[47]
Magnesium is capable of reducing water and releasing highly flammable hydrogen
gas:[48]
      Mg (s) + 2 H
      2O (l) â
      Mg(OH)
      2
       (s) + H
      2 (g)
Therefore, water cannot extinguish magnesium fires. The hydrogen gas produced
intensifies the fire. Dry sand is an effective smothering agent, but only on
relatively level and flat surfaces.
Magnesium reacts with carbon_dioxide exothermically to form magnesium_oxide and
carbon:[49]
      2 Mg + CO
      2 â 2 MgO + C (s)
Hence, carbon dioxide fuels rather than extinguishes magnesium fires.
Burning magnesium can be quenched by using a Class_D dry chemical fire
extinguisher, or by covering the fire with sand or magnesium foundry flux to
remove its air source.[50]
***** Useful compounds *****
Magnesium compounds, primarily magnesium_oxide (MgO), are used as a refractory
material in furnace linings for producing iron, steel, nonferrous_metals,
glass, and cement. Magnesium oxide and other magnesium compounds are also used
in the agricultural, chemical, and construction industries. Magnesium oxide
from calcination is used as an electrical insulator in fire-resistant_cables.
[51]
Magnesium reacted with an alkyl_halide gives a Grignard_reagent, which is a
very useful tool for preparing alcohols.
Magnesium salts are included in various foods, fertilizers (magnesium is a
component of chlorophyll), and microbe_culture_media.
Magnesium_sulfite is used in the manufacture of paper (sulfite_process).
Magnesium_phosphate is used to fireproof wood used in construction.
Magnesium hexafluorosilicate is used for moth-proofing textiles.
***** Biological roles *****
Main articles: Magnesium_in_biology and Magnesium_(medical_use)
**** Mechanism of action ****
The important interaction between phosphate and magnesium ions makes magnesium
essential to the basic nucleic_acid chemistry of all cells of all known living
organisms. More than 300 enzymes require magnesium ions for their catalytic
action, including all enzymes using or synthesizing ATP and those that use
other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA. The ATP molecule is normally found
in a chelate with a magnesium ion.[52]
**** Dietary sources, recommended intake, and supplementation ****
[refer_to_caption;_follow_link_for_complete_description]
Examples of food sources of magnesium (clockwise from top left): bran muffins,
pumpkin seeds, barley, buckwheat flour, low-fat vanilla yogurt, trail mix,
halibut steaks, garbanzo beans, lima beans, soybeans, and spinach
Spices, nuts, cereals, cocoa and vegetables are rich sources of magnesium.[14]
Green leafy vegetables such as spinach are also rich in magnesium.[53]
In the UK, the recommended_daily_values for magnesium are 300 mg for men and
270 mg for women.[54] In the U.S. the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are
400 mg for men ages 19â30 and 420 mg for older; for women 310 mg for ages
19â30 and 320 mg for older.[55]
Numerous pharmaceutical_preparations_of_magnesium and dietary_supplements are
available. In two human trials magnesium oxide, one of the most common forms in
magnesium dietary supplements because of its high magnesium content per weight,
was less bioavailable than magnesium_citrate, chloride, lactate or aspartate.
[56][57]
**** Metabolism ****
An adult has 22â26 grams of magnesium,[14][58] with 60% in the skeleton, 39%
intracellular (20% in skeletal muscle), and 1% extracellular.[14] Serum levels
are typically 0.7â1.0 mmol/L or 1.8â2.4 mEq/L. Serum magnesium levels may
be normal even when intracellular magnesium is deficient. The mechanisms for
maintaining the magnesium level in the serum are varying gastrointestinal
absorption and renal excretion. Intracellular magnesium is correlated with
intracellular potassium. Increased magnesium lowers calcium[59] and can either
prevent hypercalcemia or cause hypocalcemia depending on the initial level.[59]
Both low and high protein intake conditions inhibit magnesium absorption, as
does the amount of phosphate, phytate, and fat in the gut. Unabsorbed dietary
magnesium is excreted in feces; absorbed magnesium is excreted in urine and
sweat.[60]
**** Detection in serum and plasma ****
Magnesium status may be assessed by measuring serum and erythrocyte magnesium
concentrations coupled with urinary and fecal magnesium content, but
intravenous magnesium loading tests are more accurate and practical.[61] A
retention of 20% or more of the injected amount indicates deficiency.[62] No
biomarker has been established for magnesium.[63]
Magnesium concentrations in plasma or serum may be monitored for efficacy and
safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in
potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a
case of fatal overdose. The newborn children of mothers who received parenteral
magnesium sulfate during labor may exhibit toxicity with normal serum magnesium
levels.[64]
**** Deficiency ****
Low plasma magnesium (hypomagnesemia) is common: it is found in 2.5â15% of
the general population.[65] From 2005 to 2006, 48 percent of the United_States
population consumed less magnesium than recommended in the Dietary_Reference
Intake.[66] Other causes are increased renal or gastrointestinal loss, an
increased intracellular shift, and proton-pump inhibitor antacid therapy. Most
are asymptomatic, but symptoms referable to neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and
metabolic dysfunction may occur.[65] Alcoholism is often associated with
magnesium deficiency. Chronically low serum magnesium levels are associated
with metabolic_syndrome, diabetes_mellitus_type_2, fasciculation, and
hypertension.[67]
**** Therapy ****
    * Intravenous magnesium is recommended by the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines
      for Management of Patients With Ventricular Arrhythmias and the
      Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death for patients with ventricular
      arrhythmia associated with torsades_de_pointes who present with long_QT
      syndrome; and for the treatment of patients with digoxin induced
      arrhythmias.[68]
    * Magnesium sulfate â intravenous â is used for the management of pre-
      eclampsia and eclampsia.[69][70]
    * Hypomagnesemia, including that caused by alcoholism, is reversible by
      oral or parenteral magnesium administration depending on the degree of
      deficiency.[71]
    * There is limited evidence that magnesium supplementation may play a role
      in the prevention and treatment of migraine.[72]
Sorted by type of magnesium salt, other therapeutic applications include:
    * Magnesium_sulfate, as the heptahydrate called Epsom salts, is used as
      bath_salts, a laxative, and a highly soluble fertilizer.[73]
    * Magnesium_hydroxide, suspended in water, is used in milk_of_magnesia
      antacids and laxatives.
    * Magnesium_chloride, oxide, gluconate, malate, orotate, glycinate,
      ascorbate and citrate are all used as oral magnesium supplements.
    * Magnesium_borate, magnesium_salicylate, and magnesium_sulfate are used as
      antiseptics.
    * Magnesium_bromide is used as a mild sedative (this action is due to the
      bromide, not the magnesium).
    * Magnesium_stearate is a slightly flammable white powder with lubricating
      properties. In pharmaceutical technology, it is used in pharmacological
      manufacture to prevent tablets from sticking to the equipment while
      compressing the ingredients into tablet form.
    * Magnesium carbonate powder is used by athletes such as gymnasts,
      weightlifters, and climbers to eliminate palm sweat, prevent sticking,
      and improve the grip on gymnastic apparatus, lifting bars, and climbing
      rocks.
**** Overdose ****
Overdose from dietary sources alone is unlikely because excess magnesium in the
blood is promptly filtered by the kidneys,[65] and overdose is more likely in
the presence of impaired renal function. In spite of this, megadose_therapy has
caused death in a young child,[74] and severe hypermagnesemia in a woman[75]
and a young girl[76] who had healthy kidneys. The most common symptoms of
overdose are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; other symptoms include
hypotension, confusion, slowed heart and respiratory rate, deficiencies of
other minerals, coma, cardiac_arrhythmia, and death from cardiac_arrest.[59]
**** Function in plants ****
Plants require magnesium to synthesize chlorophyll, essential for
photosynthesis. Magnesium in the center of the porphyrin_ring in chlorophyll
functions in a manner similar to the iron in the center of the porphyrin ring
in heme. Magnesium_deficiency in plants causes late-season yellowing between
leaf veins, especially in older leaves, and can be corrected by either applying
epsom_salts (which is rapidly leached), or crushed dolomitic limestone, to the
soil.

      plays a role in migraine development at a biochemical level, but the role
      of oral magnesium supplementation in migraine prophylaxis and treatment
      remains to be fully elucidated. The strength of evidence supporting oral
      magnesium supplementation is limited at this time.
