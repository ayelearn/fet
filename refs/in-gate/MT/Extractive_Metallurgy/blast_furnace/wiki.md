Former blast furnace in Port of Sagunto, Valencia, Spain.
A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce
industrial metals, generally pig_iron, but also others such as lead or copper.
Blast refers to the combustion air being "forced" or supplied above atmospheric
pressure.[1]
In a blast furnace, fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are continuously
supplied through the top of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes
with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through
a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical_reactions take place
throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are
usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and waste gases
(flue gas) exiting from the top of the furnace. The downward flow of the ore
and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion
gases is a countercurrent_exchange and chemical reaction process.[2]
In contrast, air furnaces (such as reverberatory_furnaces) are naturally
aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According
to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing_houses for tin, and
smelt_mills for lead would be classified as blast furnaces. However, the term
has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron_ore to produce pig
iron, an intermediate material used in the production of commercial iron and
steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter_plants in base
metals smelting.[3][4]

Cast iron has been found in China dating to the 5th century BC, but the
earliest extant blast furnaces in China date to the 1st century AD and in the
West from the High_Middle_Ages.[5] They spread from the region around Namur in
Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in
1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful
substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to English inventor
Abraham_Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by
the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot_blast), patented by Scottish
inventor James_Beaumont_Neilson in 1828.[6]
**** China[edit] ****
See also: History_of_metallurgy_in_China
Archaeological evidence shows that bloomeries appeared in China around 800 BC.
Originally it was thought that the Chinese started casting iron right from the
beginning, but this theory has since been debunked by the discovery of 'more
than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke_Jing_of_Qin (d. 537
BC), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang_County, Shaanxi (a museum exists on the
site today).[7] There is however no evidence of the bloomery in China after the
appearance of the blast furnace and cast iron. In China blast furnaces produced
cast iron, which was then either converted into finished implements in a cupola
furnace, or turned into wrought iron in a fining hearth.[8]
Although cast_iron farm tools and weapons were widespread in China by the 5th
century BC, employing workforces of over 200 men in iron smelters from the 3rd
century onward, the earliest extant blast furnaces were built date to the Han
Dynasty in the 1st century AD.[9] These early furnaces had clay walls and used
phosphorus-containing minerals as a flux.[10] Chinese blast furnaces ranged
from around two to ten meters in height, depending on the region. The largest
ones were found in modern Sichuan and Guangdong, while the 'dwarf" blast
furnaces were found in Dabieshan. In construction, they are both around the
same level of technological sophistication [11]
The effectiveness of the Chinese blast furnace was enhanced during this period
by the engineer Du_Shi (c. AD 31), who applied the power of waterwheels to
piston-bellows in forging cast iron.[12] Donald Wagner suggests that early
blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt
bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time
the State_of_Qin had unified China (221 BC). Usage of the blast and cupola
furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang_Dynasties.[13] By the 11th
century, the Song_Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a switch of resources from
charcoal to coke in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of
woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.
[14][15]
The primary advantage of the early blast furnace was in large scale production
and making iron implements more readily available to peasants.[16] Cast iron is
more brittle than wrought iron or steel, which required additional fining and
then cementation or co-fusion to produce, but for menial activities such as
farming it sufficed. By using the blast furnace, it was possible to produce
larger quantities of tools such as ploughshares more efficiently than the
bloomery. In areas where quality was important, such as warfare, wrought iron
and steel were preferred. Nearly all Han period weapons are made of wrought
iron or steel, with the exception of axe-heads, of which many are made of cast
iron.[17]
Blast furnaces were also later used to produce gunpowder weapons such as cast
iron bomb shells and cast iron cannons during the Song_dynasty.[18]
**** Medieval Europe[edit] ****
The simplest forge, known as the Corsican, was used prior to the advent of
Christianity. Examples of improved bloomeries are the StÃ¼ckofen [fr][19]
(sometimes called wolf-furnace[20]), which remained until the beginning of the
19th century. Instead of using natural draught, air was pumped in by a trompe,
resulting in better quality iron and an increased capacity. This pumping of
airstream in with bellows is known as cold blast, and it increases the fuel
efficiency of the bloomery and improves yield. They can also be built bigger
than natural draught bloomeries.
*** Oldest European blast furnaces[edit] ***
The first blast furnace of Germany as depicted in a miniature in the Deutsches
Museum
The oldest known blast furnaces in the West were built in DÃ¼rstel in
Switzerland, the MÃ¤rkische Sauerland in Germany, and at Lapphyttan in Sweden,
where the complex was active between 1205 and 1300.[21] At Noraskog in the
Swedish parish of JÃ¤rnboÃ¥s, there have also been found traces of blast
furnaces dated even earlier, possibly to around 1100.[22] These early blast
furnaces, like the Chinese examples, were very inefficient compared to those
used today. The iron from the Lapphyttan complex was used to produce balls of
wrought_iron known as osmonds, and these were traded internationally â a
possible reference occurs in a treaty with Novgorod from 1203 and several
certain references in accounts of English customs from the 1250s and 1320s.
Other furnaces of the 13th to 15th centuries have been identified in
Westphalia.[23]
The technology required for blast furnaces may have either been transferred
from China, or may have been an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th
century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz
Mountains to the south of the Caspian_Sea. This is close to the silk_route, so
that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later
descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high.[24] As the
Varangian Rus'_people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their
Volga_trade_route, it is possible that the technology reached Sweden by this
means.[25] High quality ores, water power for bellows for blast and wood for
charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace
technology was independently invented in Africa by the Haya_people, it is more
likely that the process was invented independently in Scandinavia.[citation
needed] The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just
building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of
the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher
temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the
smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which
greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast.[26]
This Caspian region may also separately be the technological source for at
furnace at Ferriere, described by Filarete.[27] Water-powered bellows at
Semogo [it] in northern Italy in 1226 in a two-stage process. In this, the
molten iron was tapped twice a day into water thereby granulating it.[28]
*** Cistercian contributions[edit] ***
One means by which certain technological advances were transmitted within
Europe was a result of the General Chapter of the Cistercian monks. This may
have included the blast furnace, as the Cistercians are known to have been
skilled metallurgists.[29] According to Jean Gimpel, their high level of
industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques: "Every
monastery had a model factory, often as large as the church and only several
feet away, and waterpower drove the machinery of the various industries located
on its floor." Iron ore deposits were often donated to the monks along with
forges to extract the iron, and within time surpluses were being offered for
sale. The Cistercians became the leading iron producers in Champagne, France,
from the mid-13th century to the 17th century,[30] also using the phosphate-
rich slag from their furnaces as an agricultural fertilizer.[31]
Archaeologists are still discovering the extent of Cistercian technology.[32]
At Laskill, an outstation of Rievaulx_Abbey and the only medieval blast furnace
so far identified in Britain, the slag produced was low in iron content.[33]
Slag from other furnaces of the time contained a substantial concentration of
iron, whereas Laskill is believed to have produced cast iron quite efficiently.
[33][34][35] Its date is not yet clear, but it probably did not survive until
Henry_VIII's Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries in the late 1530s, as an agreement
(immediately after that) concerning the "smythes" with the Earl_of_Rutland in
1541 refers to blooms.[36] Nevertheless, the means by which the blast furnace
spread in medieval Europe has not finally been determined.
***** Origin and spread of early modern blast furnaces[edit] *****
Period drawing of an 18th-century blast furnace
Due to the casting of cannon, the blast furnace came into widespread use in
France in the mid 15th century.[37][38]
The direct ancestor of these used in France and England was in the Namur region
in what is now Wallonia (Belgium). From there, they spread first to the Pays_de
Bray on the eastern boundary of Normandy and from there to the Weald of Sussex,
where the first furnace (called Queenstock) in Buxted was built in about 1491,
followed by one at Newbridge in Ashdown_Forest in 1496. They remained few in
number until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the
Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590. Most of the
pig iron from these furnaces was taken to finery_forges for the production of
bar_iron.[39]
The first British furnaces outside the Weald appeared during the 1550s, and
many were built in the remainder of that century and the following ones. The
output of the industry probably peaked about 1620, and was followed by a slow
decline until the early 18th century. This was apparently because it was more
economic to import iron from Sweden and elsewhere than to make it in some more
remote British locations. Charcoal that was economically available to the
industry was probably being consumed as fast as the wood to make it grew.[40]
The Backbarrow blast furnace built in Cumbria in 1711 has been described as the
first efficient example.[who?]
The first blast furnace in Russia opened in 1637 near Tula and was called the
Gorodishche Works. The blast furnace spread from here to the central Russia and
then finally to the Urals.[41]
**** Coke blast furnaces[edit] ****
The original blast furnaces at Blists Hill, Madeley
Charging the experimental blast furnace, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory,
1930
In 1709, at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, England, Abraham_Darby began to fuel a
blast furnace with coke instead of charcoal. Coke's initial advantage was its
lower cost, mainly because making coke required much less labor than cutting
trees and making charcoal, but using coke also overcame localized shortages of
wood, especially in Britain and on the Continent. Metallurgical grade coke will
bear heavier weight than charcoal, allowing larger furnaces.[42][43] A
disadvantage is that coke contains more impurities than charcoal, with sulfur
being especially detrimental to the iron's quality. Coke's impurities were more
of a problem before hot blast reduced the amount of coke required and before
furnace temperatures were hot enough to make slag from limestone free flowing.
(Limestone ties up sulfur. Manganese may also be added to tie up sulfur).[44]:
123â125[45][46][37]:122â23
Coke iron was initially only used for foundry work, making pots and other cast
iron goods. Foundry work was a minor branch of the industry, but Darby's son
built a new furnace at nearby Horsehay, and began to supply the owners of
finery_forges with coke pig iron for the production of bar iron. Coke pig iron
was by this time cheaper to produce than charcoal pig iron. The use of a coal-
derived fuel in the iron industry was a key factor in the British Industrial
Revolution.[47][48][49] Darby's original blast furnace has been
archaeologically excavated and can be seen in situ at Coalbrookdale, part of
the Ironbridge_Gorge Museums. Cast iron from the furnace was used to make
girders for the world's first iron bridge in 1779. The_Iron_Bridge crosses the
River_Severn at Coalbrookdale and remains in use for pedestrians.
**** Steam-powered blast[edit] ****
The steam engine was applied to power blast air, overcoming a shortage of water
power in areas where coal and iron ore were located. The cast iron blowing
cylinder was developed in 1768 to replace the leather bellows, which wore out
quickly. The steam engine and cast iron blowing cylinder led to a large
increase in British iron production in the late 18th century.[37]
**** Hot blast[edit] ****
Hot Blast was the single most important advance in fuel efficiency of the blast
furnace and was one of the most important technologies developed during the
Industrial_Revolution.[50][51] Hot_blast was patented by James_Beaumont_Neilson
at Wilsontown_Ironworks in Scotland in 1828. Within a few years of the
introduction, hot blast was developed to the point where fuel consumption was
cut by one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal, while furnace capacity
was also significantly increased. Within a few decades, the practice was to
have a "stove" as large as the furnace next to it into which the waste gas
(containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt. The resultant heat was
used to preheat the air blown into the furnace.[52]
Hot blast enabled the use of raw anthracite coal, which was difficult to light,
to the blast furnace. Anthracite was first tried successfully by George Crane
at Ynyscedwyn_Ironworks in south Wales in 1837.[53] It was taken up in America
by the Lehigh_Crane_Iron_Company at Catasauqua,_Pennsylvania, in 1839.
Anthracite use declined when very high capacity blast furnaces requiring coke
were built in the 1870s.
**** Modern furnaces[edit] ****
*** Iron blast furnaces[edit] ***
The blast furnace remains an important part of modern iron production. Modern
furnaces are highly efficient, including Cowper_stoves to pre-heat the blast
air and employ recovery systems to extract the heat from the hot gases exiting
the furnace. Competition in industry drives higher production rates. The
largest blast furnace in the world is in South Korea, with a volume around
6,000 m3 (210,000 cu ft). It can produce around 5,650,000 tonnes (5,560,000 LT)
of iron per year.[54]
This is a great increase from the typical 18th-century furnaces, which averaged
about 360 tonnes (350 long tons; 400 short tons) per year. Variations of the
blast furnace, such as the Swedish electric blast furnace, have been developed
in countries which have no native coal resources.
*** Lead blast furnaces[edit] ***
Blast furnaces are currently rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead
smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are
rectangular in shape.[55] The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m.[56]
Modern lead blast furnaces are constructed using water-cooled steel or copper
jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls.[55]
The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory_material (bricks or castable
refractory).[55] Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having
the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.[57]
The blast furnace used at the Nyrstar Port_Pirie lead smelter differs from most
other lead blast furnaces in that it has a double row of tuyeres rather than
the single row normally used.[56] The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair
shape with the lower part of the shaft being narrower than the upper.[56] The
lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the shaft.[56] This
allows the upper part of the shaft to be wider than the standard.[56]
*** Zinc blast furnaces (Imperial Smelting Furnaces)[edit] ***
The blast furnaces used in the Imperial_Smelting_Process ("ISP") were developed
from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed.[58] This is because
the zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase,
and the presence of oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc
oxide.[58]
Blast furnaces used in the ISP have a more intense operation than standard lead
blast furnaces, with higher air blast rates per m2 of hearth area and a higher
coke consumption.[58]
Zinc production with the ISP is more expensive than with electrolytic_zinc
plants, so several smelters operating this technology have closed in recent
years.[59] However, ISP furnaces have the advantage of being able to treat zinc
concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can electrolytic zinc
plants.[58]

Modern furnaces are equipped with an array of supporting facilities to increase
efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw
materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail
hoppers and ore_transfer_cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled
weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot
metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought to the top of the blast
furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.[60]
There are different ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast
furnace. Some blast furnaces use a "double bell" system where two "bells" are
used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose
of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace.
First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then
opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to
seal the blast furnace, while the large bell rotates to provide specific
distribution of materials before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace.
[61][62] A more recent design is to use a "bell-less" system. These systems use
multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into
the blast furnace through valves.[61] These valves are more accurate at
controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or
conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of
these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the
furnace (as with the Paul Wurth top) in order to precisely control where the
charge is placed.[63]
The iron making blast furnace itself is built in the form of a tall structure,
lined with refractory brick, and profiled to allow for expansion of the charged
materials as they heat during their descent, and subsequent reduction in size
as melting starts to occur. Coke, limestone flux, and iron ore (iron oxide) are
charged into the top of the furnace in a precise filling order which helps
control gas flow and the chemical reactions inside the furnace. Four "uptakes"
allow the hot, dirty gas high in carbon monoxide content to exit the furnace
throat, while "bleeder valves" protect the top of the furnace from sudden gas
pressure surges. The coarse particles in the exhaust gas settle in the "dust
catcher" and are dumped into a railroad car or truck for disposal, while the
gas itself flows through a venturi_scrubber and/or electrostatic precipitators
and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the cleaned gas.[60]
The "casthouse" at the bottom half of the furnace contains the bustle pipe,
water cooled copper tuyeres and the equipment for casting the liquid iron and
slag. Once a "taphole" is drilled through the refractory clay plug, liquid iron
and slag flow down a trough through a "skimmer" opening, separating the iron
and slag. Modern, larger blast furnaces may have as many as four tapholes and
two casthouses.[60] Once the pig iron and slag has been tapped, the taphole is
again plugged with refractory clay.
Tuyeres of Blast Furnace at Gerdau, Brazil
The tuyeres are used to implement a hot_blast, which is used to increase the
efficiency of the blast furnace. The hot blast is directed into the furnace
through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot blast
temperature can be from 900 Â°C to 1300 Â°C (1600 Â°F to 2300 Â°F) depending on
the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000 Â°C
to 2300 Â°C (3600 Â°F to 4200 Â°F). Oil, tar, natural_gas, powdered coal and
oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with
the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing
gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.[60]
***** Process engineering and chemistry[edit] *****
Blast furnaces of TÅinec_Iron_and_Steel_Works, Czech Republic
Blast furnaces operate on the principle of chemical_reduction whereby carbon
monoxide, having a stronger affinity for the oxygen in iron ore than iron does,
reduces the iron to its elemental form. Blast furnaces differ from bloomeries
and reverberatory_furnaces in that in a blast furnace, flue gas is in direct
contact with the ore and iron, allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore
and reduce the iron oxide to elemental iron mixed with carbon. The blast
furnaces operates as a countercurrent_exchange process whereas a bloomery does
not. Another difference is that bloomeries operate as a batch process while
blast furnaces operate continuously for long periods because they are difficult
to start up and shut down. (See: Continuous_production) Also, the carbon in pig
iron lowers the melting point below that of steel or pure iron; in contrast,
iron does not melt in a bloomery.
Silica has to be removed from the pig iron. It reacts with calcium_oxide
(burned limestone) and forms a silicate which floats to the surface of the
molten pig iron as "slag". Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur,
the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.
The downward moving column of ore, flux, coke or charcoal and reaction products
must be porous enough for the flue gas to pass through. This requires the coke
or charcoal to be in large enough particles to be permeable, meaning there
cannot be an excess of fine particles. Therefore, the coke must be strong
enough so it will not be crushed by the weight of the material above it.
Besides physical strength of the coke, it must also be low in sulfur,
phosphorus, and ash. This necessitates the use of metallurgical coal, which is
a premium grade due to its relative scarcity.
The main chemical reaction producing the molten iron is:
      Fe2O3 + 3CO â 2Fe + 3CO2[64]
This reaction might be divided into multiple steps, with the first being that
preheated blast air blown into the furnace reacts with the carbon in the form
of coke to produce carbon_monoxide and heat:
      2 C(s) + O2(g) â 2 CO(g)[65]
The hot carbon monoxide is the reducing agent for the iron ore and reacts with
the iron_oxide to produce molten iron and carbon_dioxide. Depending on the
temperature in the different parts of the furnace (warmest at the bottom) the
iron is reduced in several steps. At the top, where the temperature usually is
in the range between 200 Â°C and 700 Â°C, the iron oxide is partially reduced
to iron(II,III) oxide, Fe3O4.
      3 Fe2O3(s) + CO(g) â 2 Fe3O4(s) + CO2(g)[65]
At temperatures around 850 Â°C, further down in the furnace, the iron(II,III)
is reduced further to iron(II) oxide:
      Fe3O4(s) + CO(g) â 3 FeO(s) + CO2(g)[65]
Hot carbon dioxide, unreacted carbon monoxide, and nitrogen from the air pass
up through the furnace as fresh feed material travels down into the reaction
zone. As the material travels downward, the counter-current gases both preheat
the feed charge and decompose the limestone to calcium_oxide and carbon
dioxide:
      CaCO3(s) â CaO(s) + CO2(g)[65]
The calcium oxide formed by decomposition reacts with various acidic impurities
in the iron (notably silica), to form a fayalitic slag which is essentially
calcium_silicate, CaSiO3:[64]
      SiO2 + CaO â CaSiO3[66][better source needed]
As the iron(II) oxide moves down to the area with higher temperatures, ranging
up to 1200 Â°C degrees, it is reduced further to iron metal:
      FeO(s) + CO(g) â Fe(s) + CO2(g)[65]
The carbon dioxide formed in this process is re-reduced to carbon monoxide by
the coke:
      C(s) + CO2(g) â 2 CO(g)[65]
The temperature-dependent equilibrium controlling the gas atmosphere in the
furnace is called the Boudouard_reaction:
            2CO â CO2 + C
The "pig_iron" produced by the blast furnace has a relatively high carbon
content of around 4â5%, making it very brittle, and of limited immediate
commercial use. Some pig iron is used to make cast_iron. The majority of pig
iron produced by blast furnaces undergoes further processing to reduce the
carbon content and produce various grades of steel used for construction
materials, automobiles, ships and machinery.
Although the efficiency of blast furnaces is constantly evolving, the chemical
process inside the blast furnace remains the same. According to the American
Iron_and_Steel_Institute: "Blast furnaces will survive into the next millennium
because the larger, efficient furnaces can produce hot metal at costs
competitive with other iron making technologies."[60] One of the biggest
drawbacks of the blast furnaces is the inevitable carbon dioxide production as
iron is reduced from iron oxides by carbon and as of 2016, there is no
economical substitute â steelmaking is one of the largest industrial
contributors of the CO2 emissions in the world (see greenhouse_gases).
The challenge set by the greenhouse gas emissions of the blast furnace is being
addressed in an ongoing European Program called ULCOS (Ultra Low CO2
Steelmaking).[67] Several new process routes have been proposed and
investigated in depth to cut specific emissions (CO
2 per ton of steel) by at least 50%. Some rely on the capture and further
storage (CCS) of CO
2, while others choose decarbonizing iron and steel production, by turning to
hydrogen, electricity and biomass.[68] In the nearer term, a technology that
incorporates CCS into the blast furnace process itself and is called the Top-
Gas Recycling Blast Furnace is under development, with a scale-up to a
commercial size blast furnace under way. The technology should be fully
demonstrated by the end of the 2010s, in line with the timeline set, for

***** Manufacture of stone wool[edit] *****
Stone wool or rock_wool is a spun mineral fibre used as an insulation product
and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a blast furnace fed with diabase rock
which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off
and spun to form the rock wool product.[69] Very small amounts of metals are
also produced which are an unwanted by-product and run to waste.
***** Decommissioned blast furnaces as museum sites[edit] *****
Main article: List_of_preserved_historic_blast_furnaces
For a long time, it was normal procedure for a decommissioned blast furnace to
be demolished and either be replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the
entire site demolished to make room for follow-up use of the area. In recent
decades, several countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part
of their industrial history. Rather than being demolished, abandoned steel
mills were turned into museums or integrated into multi-purpose parks. The
largest number of preserved historic blast furnaces exists in Germany; other
such sites exist in Spain, France, the Czech_Republic, Japan, Luxembourg,
Poland, Romania, Mexico, Russia and the United States.
***** Gas cleaning systems[edit] *****
The blast furnace gas can be used to generate heat. So by reducing the
constituents in blast furnace gas we can increase the calorific value and can
be used to generate heat and rise the temperature in any furnace.
The gas cleaning system contains two stages, the coarse cleaning system and the
fine cleaning system.
In the coarse cleaning system a dust catcher is used. A dust catcher is a
cylindrical steel structure with conical top and bottom sections. It is also
lined with refractory bricks.
[Dust_catcher_drawing.png]
The principle of the dust catcher is that the dust-laden gas is given a sudden
reverse in speed and direction. Because of their mass, the coarse dust
particles cannot change their velocity easily, and hence settle to the bottom.
