****** Phase rule ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The phase rule is a general principle governing systems in thermodynamic
equilibrium. If F is the number of degrees_of_freedom, C is the number of
components and P is the number of phases, then [1]
         F = C &#x2212; P + 2.   {\displaystyle F=C-P+2.}  [{\displaystyle F=C-
      P+2.}]
It was derived by Josiah_Willard_Gibbs in his landmark paper titled On_the
Equilibrium_of_Heterogeneous_Substances, published in parts between 1875 and
1878.[2] The rule assumes the components do not react with each other.
The number of degrees of freedom is the number of independent intensive
variables, i.e. the largest number of thermodynamic parameters such as
temperature or pressure that can be varied simultaneously and arbitrarily
without determining one another. An example of one-component system is a system
involving one pure chemical, while two-component systems, such as mixtures of
water and ethanol, have two chemically independent components, and so on.
Typical phases are solids, liquids and gases.

***** Foundations[edit] *****
    * A phase is a form of matter that is homogeneous in chemical_composition
      and physical_state. Typical phases are solid, liquid and gas. Two
      immiscible liquids (or liquid mixtures with different compositions)
      separated by a distinct boundary are counted as two different phases, as
      are two immiscible solids.
    * The number of components (C) is the number of chemically independent
      constituents of the system, i.e. the minimum number of independent
      species necessary to define the composition of all phases of the system.
      [1] For examples see component_(thermodynamics).
    * The number of degrees of freedom (F) in this context is the number of
      intensive variables which are independent of each other.
The basis for the rule (Atkins and de Paula,[1] justification 6.1) is that
equilibrium between phases places a constraint on the intensive variables. More
rigorously, since the phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other,
the chemical_potentials of the phases must be equal. The number of equality
relationships determines the number of degrees of freedom. For example, if the
chemical potentials of a liquid and of its vapour depend on temperature (T) and
pressure (p), the equality of chemical potentials will mean that each of those
variables will be dependent on the other. Mathematically, the equation Î¼liq(T,
p) = Î¼vap(T, p), where Î¼ = chemical potential, defines temperature as a
function of pressure or vice versa. (Caution: do not confuse p = pressure with
P = number of phases.)
To be more specific, the composition of each phase is determined by C â 1
intensive variables (such as mole fractions) in each phase. The total number of
variables is (C â 1)P + 2, where the extra two are temperature T and pressure
p. The number of constraints is C(P â 1), since the chemical potential of
each component must be equal in all phases. Subtract the number of constraints
from the number of variables to obtain the number of degrees of freedom as F =
(C â 1)P + 2 â C(P â 1) = C â P + 2.
The rule is valid provided the equilibrium between phases is not influenced by
gravitational, electrical or magnetic forces, or by surface area, and only by
temperature, pressure, and concentration.
***** Consequences and examples[edit] *****
**** Pure substances (one component)[edit] ****
For pure substances C = 1 so that F = 3 â P. In a single phase (P = 1)
condition of a pure component system, two variables (F = 2), such as
temperature and pressure, can be chosen independently to be any pair of values
consistent with the phase. However, if the temperature and pressure combination
ranges to a point where the pure component undergoes a separation into two
phases (P = 2), F decreases from 2 to 1. When the system enters the two-phase
region, it becomes no longer possible to independently control temperature and
pressure.

critical_point of carbon dioxide
In the phase_diagram to the right, the boundary curve between the liquid and
gas regions maps the constraint between temperature and pressure when the
single-component system has separated into liquid and gas phases at
equilibrium. The only way to increase the pressure on the two phase line is by
increasing the temperature. If the temperature is decreased by cooling, some of
the gas condenses, decreasing the pressure. Throughout both processes, the
temperature and pressure stay in the relationship shown by this boundary curve
unless one phase is entirely consumed by evaporation or condensation, or unless
the critical_point is reached. As long as there are two phases, there is only
one degree of freedom, which corresponds to the position along the phase
boundary curve.
The critical point is the black dot at the end of the liquidâgas boundary. As
this point is approached, the liquid and gas phases become progressively more
similar until, at the critical point, there is no longer a separation into two
phases. Above the critical point and away from the phase boundary curve, F = 2
and the temperature and pressure can be controlled independently. Hence there
is only one phase, and it has the physical properties of a dense gas, but is
also referred to as a supercritical_fluid.
Of the other two-boundary curves, one is the solidâliquid boundary or melting
point curve which indicates the conditions for equilibrium between these two
phases, and the other at lower temperature and pressure is the solidâgas
boundary.
Even for a pure substance, it is possible that three phases, such as solid,
liquid and vapour, can exist together in equilibrium (P = 3). If there is only
one component, there are no degrees of freedom (F = 0) when there are three
phases. Therefore, in a single-component system, this three-phase mixture can
only exist at a single temperature and pressure, which is known as a triple
point. Here there are two equations Î¼sol(T, p) = Î¼liq(T, p) = Î¼vap(T, p),
which are sufficient to determine the two variables T and p. In the diagram for
CO2 the triple point is the point at which the solid, liquid and gas phases
come together, at 5.2 bar and 217 K. It is also possible for other sets of
phases to form a triple point, for example in the water system there is a
triple point where ice_I, ice_III and liquid can coexist.
If four phases of a pure substance were in equilibrium (P = 4), the phase rule
would give F = â1, which is meaningless, since there cannot be â1
independent variables. This explains the fact that four phases of a pure
substance (such as ice I, ice III, liquid water and water vapour) are not found
in equilibrium at any temperature and pressure. In terms of chemical potentials
there are now three equations, which cannot in general be satisfied by any
values of the two variables T and p, although in principle they might be solved
in a special case where one equation is mathematically dependent on the other
two. In practice, however, the coexistence of more phases than allowed by the
phase rule normally means that the phases are not all in true equilibrium.
**** Two-component systems[edit] ****
For binary mixtures of two chemically independent components, C = 2 so that F =
4 â P. In addition to temperature and pressure, the other degree of freedom
is the composition of each phase, often expressed as mole_fraction or mass
fraction of one component.
Boiling Point Diagram
As an example, consider the system of two completely miscible liquids such as
toluene and benzene, in equilibrium with their vapours. This system may be
described by a boiling-point_diagram which shows the composition (mole
fraction) of the two phases in equilibrium as functions of temperature (at a
fixed pressure).
Four thermodynamic variables which may describe the system include temperature
(T), pressure (p), mole fraction of component 1 (toluene) in the liquid phase
(x1L), and mole fraction of component 1 in the vapour phase (x1V). However,
since two phases are present (P = 2) in equilibrium, only two of these
variables can be independent (F = 2). This is because the four variables are
constrained by two relations: the equality of the chemical potentials of liquid
toluene and toluene vapour, and the corresponding equality for benzene.
For given T and p, there will be two phases at equilibrium when the overall
composition of the system (system point) lies in between the two curves. A
horizontal line (isotherm or tie line) can be drawn through any such system
point, and intersects the curve for each phase at its equilibrium composition.
The quantity of each phase is given by the lever_rule (expressed in the
variable corresponding to the x-axis, here mole fraction).
For the analysis of fractional_distillation, the two independent variables are
instead considered to be liquid-phase composition (x1L) and pressure. In that
case the phase rule implies that the equilibrium temperature (boiling_point)
and vapour-phase composition are determined.
Liquidâvapour phase_diagrams for other systems may have azeotropes (maxima or
minima) in the composition curves, but the application of the phase rule is
unchanged. The only difference is that the compositions of the two phases are
equal exactly at the azeotropic composition.
***** Phase rule at constant pressure[edit] *****
For applications in materials_science dealing with phase changes between
different solid structures, pressure is often imagined to be constant (for
example at one atmosphere), and is ignored as a degree of freedom, so the rule
becomes
      F = C â P + 1.
This is sometimes misleadingly called the "condensed phase rule", but it is not
applicable to condensed systems which are subject to high pressures (for
example, in geology), since the effects of these pressures can be important.
