Galvanic corrosion (also called bimetallic corrosion) is an electrochemical
process in which one metal corrodes preferentially when it is in electrical
contact with another, in the presence of an electrolyte. A similar galvanic
reaction is exploited in primary_cells to generate a useful electrical voltage
to power portable devices.

***** Overview[edit] *****
Dissimilar metals and alloys have different electrode_potentials, and when two
or more come into contact in an electrolyte, one metal acts as anode and the
other as cathode. If the electrolyte contains only metal ions that are not
easily reduced (such as Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, or Zn2+), the cathode reaction is
reduction of dissolved H+ to H2 or O2 to OHâ.[1][2][3][4] The
electropotential difference between the reactions at the two electrodes is the
driving force for an accelerated attack on the anode metal, which dissolves
into the electrolyte. This leads to the metal at the anode corroding more
quickly than it otherwise would and corrosion at the cathode being inhibited.
The presence of an electrolyte and an electrical conducting path between the
metals is essential for galvanic corrosion to occur. The electrolyte provides a
means for ion migration whereby ions move to prevent charge build-up that would
otherwise stop the reaction.
In some cases, this type of reaction is intentionally encouraged. For example,
low-cost household batteries typically contain carbon-zinc_cells. As part of a
closed_circuit (the electron pathway), the zinc within the cell will corrode
preferentially (the ion pathway) as an essential part of the battery producing
electricity. Another example is the cathodic_protection of buried or submerged
structures as well as hot_water_storage_tanks. In this case, sacrificial_anodes
work as part of a galvanic couple, promoting corrosion of the anode, while
protecting the cathode metal.
In other cases, such as mixed metals in piping (for example, copper, cast iron
and other cast metals), galvanic corrosion will contribute to accelerated
corrosion of parts of the system. Corrosion_inhibitors such as sodium_nitrite
or sodium_molybdate can be injected into these systems to reduce the galvanic
potential. However, the application of these corrosion inhibitors must be
monitored closely. If the application of corrosion inhibitors increases the
conductivity of the water within the system, the galvanic corrosion potential
can be greatly increased.
Acidity or alkalinity (pH) is also a major consideration with regard to closed
loop bimetallic circulating systems. Should the pH and corrosion inhibition
doses be incorrect, galvanic corrosion will be accelerated. In most HVAC
systems, the use of sacrificial anodes and cathodes is not an option, as they
would need to be applied within the plumbing of the system and, over time,
would corrode and release particles that could cause potential mechanical
damage to circulating pumps, heat exchangers, etc.[5]
***** Examples of corrosion[edit] *****
A common example of galvanic corrosion occurs in galvanized_iron, a sheet of
iron or steel covered with a zinc coating. Even when the protective zinc
coating is broken, the underlying steel is not attacked. Instead, the zinc is
corroded because it is less "noble"; only after it has been consumed can
rusting of the base metal occur in earnest. By contrast, with a traditional tin
can, the opposite of a protective effect occurs: because the tin is more noble
than the underlying steel, when the tin coating is broken, the steel beneath is
immediately attacked preferentially.
**** Statue of Liberty[edit] ****
Galvanic corrosion in the Statue of Liberty
Regular maintenance checks discovered that the Statue of Liberty suffered from
galvanic corrosion
A spectacular example of galvanic corrosion occurred in the Statue_of_Liberty
when regular maintenance checks in the 1980s revealed that corrosion had taken
place between the outer copper skin and the wrought_iron support structure.
Although the problem had been anticipated when the structure was built by
Gustave_Eiffel to FrÃ©dÃ©ric_Bartholdi's design in the 1880s, the insulation
layer of shellac between the two metals had failed over time and resulted in
rusting of the iron supports. An extensive renovation requiring complete
disassembly of the statue and replacement of the original insulation with PTFE.
The structure was far from unsafe owing to the large number of unaffected
connections, but it was regarded as a precautionary measure to preserve a
national symbol of the United States.[6][7]
**** Royal Navy and HMS Alarm[edit] ****
In 17th-century England, Samuel_Pepys (then serving as Admiralty Secretary),
agreed to the removal of lead sheathing from British_Royal_Navy vessels to
prevent the mysterious disintegration of their rudder-irons and bolt-heads,
though he confessed himself baffled as to the reason the lead caused the
corrosion.[8]
The problem recurred when vessels were sheathed in copper to reduce marine weed
accumulation and protect against shipworm. In an experiment, the Royal Navy in
1761 had tried fitting the hull of the frigate HMS_Alarm with 12-ounce copper
plating. Upon her return from a voyage to the West Indies, it was found that
although the copper remained in fine condition and had indeed deterred
shipworm, it had also become detached from the wooden hull in many places
because the iron nails used during its installation "...were found dissolved
into a kind of rusty Paste".[9] To the surprise of the inspection teams,
however, some of the iron nails were virtually undamaged. Closer inspection
revealed that water-resistant brown paper trapped under the nail head had
inadvertently protected some of the nails: "Where this covering was perfect,
the Iron was preserved from Injury". The copper sheathing had been delivered to
the dockyard wrapped in the paper which was not always removed before the
sheets were nailed to the hull. The conclusion therefore reported to the
Admiralty in 1763 was that iron should not be allowed direct contact with
copper in sea water.[10][11]
**** US Navy Littoral Combat Ship Independence[edit] ****
Serious galvanic corrosion has been reported on the latest US Navy attack
littoral combat vessel the USS_Independence caused by steel water jet
propulsion systems attached to an aluminium hull. Without electrical isolation
between the steel and aluminium, the aluminium hull acts as an anode to the
stainless steel, resulting in aggressive galvanic corrosion.[12]
**** Corroding lighting fixtures[edit] ****
Main article: Big_Dig_Â§ Lighting_fixtures
The unexpected fall in 2011 of a heavy light fixture from the ceiling of the
Big_Dig vehicular tunnel in Boston revealed that corrosion had weakened its
support. Improper use of aluminum in contact with stainless steel had caused
rapid corrosion in the presence of salt water.[13] The electrochemical
potential_difference between stainless steel and aluminum is in the range of
0.5 to 1.0V, depending on the exact alloys involved, and can cause considerable
corrosion within months under unfavorable conditions. Thousands of failing
lights would have to be replaced, at an estimated cost of $54 million.[14]
**** Lasagna cell[edit] ****
A "lasagna cell" is accidentally produced when salty moist food such as lasagna
is stored in a steel baking pan and is covered with aluminum foil. After a few
hours the foil develops small holes where it touches the lasagna, and the food
surface becomes covered with small spots composed of corroded aluminum.[15] In
this example, the salty food (lasagna) is the electrolyte, the aluminum foil is
the anode, and the steel pan is the cathode. If the aluminum foil only touches
the electrolyte in small areas, the galvanic corrosion is concentrated, and
corrosion can occur fairly rapidly. If the aluminum foil was not used with a
dissimilar metal container, the reaction was probably a chemical one. It is
possible for heavy concentrations of salt, vinegar or some other acidic
compound, or highly spiced foods to cause the foil to disintegrate. The product
of either of these reactions is an aluminum salt. It does not harm the food but
you will want to scrape any deposit off the food as it may impart an undesired
flavor and color. [16]
**** Electrolytic cleaning[edit] ****
The common technique of cleaning silverware by immersion of the silver or
sterling silver (or even just silver plated objects) and a piece of aluminum
(foil is preferred because of its much greater surface area compared to ingots,
although if the foil has a "non-stick" face, this must be removed with steel
wool first) in a hot electrolytic bath (usually composed of water and sodium
bicarbonate, i.e., household baking soda) is an example of galvanic corrosion.
Silver darkens and corrodes in the presence of airborne sulfur molecules, and
the copper in sterling silver corrodes under a variety of conditions. These
layers of corrosion can be largely removed through the electrochemical
reduction of silver sulfide molecules: the presence of aluminum (which is less
noble than either silver or copper) in the bath of sodium bicarbonate strips
the sulfur atoms off the silver sulfide and transfers them onto and thereby
corrodes the piece of aluminum foil (a much more reactive metal), leaving
elemental silver behind. No silver is lost in the process. [17]
***** Preventing galvanic corrosion[edit] *****

There are several ways of reducing and preventing this form of corrosion.
    * Electrically insulate the two metals from each other. If they are not in
      electrical contact, no galvanic coupling will occur. This can be achieved
      by using non-conductive materials between metals of different
      electropotential. Piping can be isolated with a spool of pipe made of
      plastic materials, or made of metal material internally coated or lined.
      It is important that the spool be a sufficient length to be effective.
      For reasons of safety, this should not be attempted where an electrical
      earthing_system uses the pipework for its ground or has equipotential
      bonding.
    * Metal boats connected to a shore line electrical power feed will normally
      have to have the hull connected to earth for safety reasons. However the
      end of that earth connection is likely to be a copper rod buried within
      the marina, resulting in a steel-copper "battery" of about 0.5 V. For
      such cases, the use of a galvanic isolator is essential, typically two
      semiconductor_diodes in series, in parallel with two diodes conducting in
      the opposite direction (antiparallel). This prevents any current while
      the applied voltage is less than 1.4 V (i.e. 0.7 V per diode), but allows
      a full current in case of an electrical fault. There will still be a very
      minor leakage of current through the diodes, which may result in slightly
      faster corrosion than normal.
    * Ensure there is no contact with an electrolyte. This can be done by using
      water-repellent compounds such as greases, or by coating the metals with
      an impermeable protective layer, such as a suitable paint, varnish, or
      plastic. If it is not possible to coat both, the coating should be
      applied to the more noble, the material with higher potential. This is
      advisable because if the coating is applied only on the more active
      material, in case of damage to the coating there will be a large cathode
      area and a very small anode area, and for the exposed anodic area the
      corrosion rate will be correspondingly high.
    * Using antioxidant paste is beneficial for preventing corrosion between
      copper and aluminum electrical connections. The paste consists of a lower
      nobility metal than aluminum or copper.
    * Choose metals that have similar electropotentials. The more closely
      matched the individual potentials, the smaller the potential_difference
      and hence the smaller the galvanic current. Using the same metal for all
      construction is the easiest way of matching potentials.
    * Electroplating or other plating can also help. This tends to use more
      noble_metals that resist corrosion better. Chrome, nickel, silver and
      gold can all be used. Galvanizing with zinc protects the steel base metal
      by sacrificial anodic action.
    * Cathodic_protection uses one or more sacrificial_anodes made of a metal
      which is more active than the protected metal. Alloys of metals commonly
      used for sacrificial anodes include zinc, magnesium, and aluminium. This
      approach is commonplace in water heaters and many buried or immersed
      metallic structures.
    * Cathodic Protection can also be applied by connecting a direct_current
      (DC) electrical power_supply to oppose the corrosive galvanic current.
      (See impressed_current_cathodic_protection)
***** Galvanic series[edit] *****

All metals can be classified into a galvanic_series representing the electrical
potential they develop in a given electrolyte against a standard reference
electrode. The relative position of two metals on such a series gives a good
indication of which metal is more likely to corrode more quickly. However,
other factors such as water_aeration and flow rate can influence the rate of
the process markedly.
***** Anodic index[edit] *****
Sacrificial anode to protect a boat
The compatibility of two different metals may be predicted by consideration of
their anodic index. This parameter is a measure of the electrochemical voltage
that will be developed between the metal and gold. To find the relative voltage
of a pair of metals it is only required to subtract their anodic indices.[18]
To reduce galvanic corrosion for metals stored in normal environments such as
storage in warehouses or non-temperature and humidity controlled environments,
there should not be more than 0.25 V difference in the anodic index of the two
metals in contact. For controlled environments in which temperature and
humidity are controlled, 0.50 V can be tolerated. For harsh environments such
as outdoors, high humidity, and salty environments, there should be not more
than 0.15 V difference in the anodic index. For example: gold and silver have a
difference of 0.15V, therefore the two metals will not experience significant
corrosion even in a harsh environment.[19][page needed]
When design considerations require that dissimilar metals come in contact, the
difference in anodic index is often managed by finishes and plating. The
finishing and plating selected allow the dissimilar materials to be in contact,
while protecting the more base materials from corrosion by the more noble.[19]
[page needed] It will always be the metal with the most negative anodic index
which will ultimately suffer from corrosion when galvanic incompatibility is in
play. This is why sterling silver and stainless steel tableware should never be
placed together in a dishwasher at the same time, as the steel items will
likely experience corrosion by the end of the cycle (soap and water having
served as the chemical electrolyte, and heat having accelerated the process).
