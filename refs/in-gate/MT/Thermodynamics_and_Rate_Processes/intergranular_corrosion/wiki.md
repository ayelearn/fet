intergranular corrosion
Intergranular corrosion (IGC), also known as intergranular attack (IGA), is a
form of corrosion where the boundaries of crystallites of the material are more
susceptible to corrosion than their insides. (Cf. transgranular corrosion.)

***** Description[edit] *****
This situation can happen in otherwise corrosion-resistant alloys, when the
grain boundaries are depleted, known as grain boundary depletion, of the
corrosion-inhibiting elements such as chromium by some mechanism. In nickel
alloys and austenitic stainless_steels, where chromium is added for corrosion
resistance, the mechanism involved is precipitation of chromium_carbide at the
grain boundaries, resulting in the formation of chromium-depleted zones
adjacent to the grain boundaries (this process is called sensitization). Around
12% chromium is minimally required to ensure passivation, a mechanism by which
an ultra thin invisible film, known as passive film, forms on the surface of
stainless steels. This passive film protects the metal from corrosive
environments. The self-healing property of the passive film make the steel
stainless. Selective_leaching often involves grain boundary depletion
mechanisms.
These zones also act as local galvanic_couples, causing local galvanic
corrosion. This condition happens when the material is heated to temperature
around 700 Â°C for too long time, and often happens during welding or an
improper heat_treatment. When zones of such material form due to welding, the
resulting corrosion is termed weld decay. Stainless steels can be stabilized
against this behavior by addition of titanium, niobium, or tantalum, which form
titanium_carbide, niobium_carbide and tantalum_carbide preferentially to
chromium carbide, by lowering the content of carbon in the steel and in case of
welding also in the filler metal under 0.02%, or by heating the entire part
above 1000 Â°C and quenching it in water, leading to dissolution of the
chromium carbide in the grains and then preventing its precipitation. Another
possibility is to keep the welded parts thin enough so that, upon cooling, the
metal dissipates heat too quickly for chromium carbide to precipitate. The ASTM
A923,[1] ASTM A262,[2] and other similar tests are often used to determine when
stainless steels are susceptible to intergranular corrosion. The tests require
etching with chemicals that reveal the presence of intermetallic particles,
sometimes combined with Charpy V-Notch and other mechanical testing.
Another related kind of intergranular corrosion is termed knifeline attack
(KLA). Knifeline attack impacts steels stabilized by niobium, such as 347
stainless steel. Titanium, niobium, and their carbides dissolve in steel at
very high temperatures. At some cooling regimes (depending on the rate of
cooling), niobium carbide does not precipitate and the steel then behaves like
unstabilized steel, forming chromium carbide instead. This affects only a thin
zone several millimeters wide in the very vicinity of the weld, making it
difficult to spot and increasing the corrosion speed. Structures made of such
steels have to be heated in a whole to about 1065 Â°C (1950 Â°F), when the
chromium carbide dissolves and niobium carbide forms. The cooling rate after
this treatment is not important, as the carbon that would otherwise pose risk
of formation of chromium carbide is already sequestered as niobium carbide. [1]
Aluminium-based alloys may be sensitive to intergranular corrosion if there are
layers of materials acting as anodes between the aluminium-rich crystals. High
strength aluminium alloys, especially when extruded or otherwise subjected to
high degree of working, can undergo exfoliation_corrosion_(metallurgy), where
the corrosion products build up between the flat, elongated grains and separate
them, resulting in lifting or leafing effect and often propagating from edges
of the material through its entire structure. [2] Intergranular corrosion is a
concern especially for alloys with high content of copper.
Other kinds of alloys can undergo exfoliation as well; the sensitivity of
cupronickel increases together with its nickel content. A broader term for this
class of corrosion is lamellar corrosion. Alloys of iron are susceptible to
lamellar corrosion, as the volume of iron_oxides is about seven times higher
than the volume of original metal, leading to formation of internal tensile
stresses tearing the material apart. Similar effect leads to formation of
lamellae in stainless steels, due to the difference of thermal expansion of the
oxides and the metal. [3]
Copper-based alloys become sensitive when depletion of copper content in the
grain boundaries occurs.
Anisotropic alloys, where extrusion or heavy working leads to formation of
long, flat grains, are especially prone to intergranular corrosion. [4]
Intergranular corrosion induced by environmental stresses is termed stress
corrosion_cracking. Inter granular corrosion can be detected by ultrasonic and
eddy current methods.
***** Sensitization effect[edit] *****
Sensitization refers to the precipitation of carbides at grain boundaries in a
stainless steel or alloy, causing the steel or alloy to be susceptible to
intergranular corrosion or intergranular stress corrosion cracking.
Unsensitized microstructure
Heavily sensitized microstructure
Certain alloys when exposed to a temperature characterized as a sensitizing
temperature become particularly susceptible to intergranular corrosion. In a
corrosive atmosphere, the grain interfaces of these sensitized alloys become
very reactive and intergranular corrosion results. This is characterized by a
localized attack at and adjacent to grain_boundaries with relatively little
corrosion of the grains themselves. The alloy disintegrates (grains fall out)
and/or loses its strength.
The photos show the typical microstructure of a normalized (unsensitized) type
304 stainless steel and a heavily sensitized steel. The samples have been
polished and etched before taking the photos, and the sensitized areas show as
wide, dark lines where the etching fluid has caused corrosion. The dark lines
consist of carbides and corrosion products. Intergranular corrosion is
generally considered to be caused by the segregation of impurities at the grain
boundaries or by enrichment or depletion of one of the alloying elements in the
grain boundary areas. Thus in certain aluminium_alloys, small amounts of iron
have been shown to segregate in the grain boundaries and cause intergranular
corrosion. Also, it has been shown that the zinc content of a brass is higher
at the grain boundaries and subject to such corrosion. High-strength aluminium
alloys such as the Duralumin-type alloys (Al-Cu) which depend upon precipitated
phases for strengthening are susceptible to intergranular corrosion following
sensitization at temperatures of about 120 Â°C. Nickel-rich alloys such as
Inconel 600 and Incoloy 800 show similar susceptibility. Die-cast zinc alloys
containing aluminum exhibit intergranular corrosion by steam in a marine
atmosphere. Cr-Mn and Cr-Mn-Ni steels are also susceptible to intergranular
corrosion following sensitization in the temperature range of 420Â°-850 Â°C. In
the case of the austenitic stainless_steels, when these steels are sensitized
by being heated in the temperature range of about 520Â° to 800 Â°C, depletion
of chromium in the grain boundary region occurs, resulting in susceptibility to
intergranular corrosion. Such sensitization of austenitic stainless steels can
readily occur because of temperature service requirements, as in steam
generators, or as a result of subsequent welding of the formed structure.
Several methods have been used to control or minimize the intergranular
corrosion of susceptible alloys, particularly of the austenitic_stainless
steels. For example, a high-temperature solution heat_treatment, commonly
termed solution-annealing, quench-annealing or solution-quenching, has been
used. The alloy is heated to a temperature of about 1,060Â° to 1,120 Â°C and
then water quenched. This method is generally unsuitable for treating large
assemblies, and also ineffective where welding is subsequently used for making
repairs or for attaching other structures.
Another control technique for preventing intergranular corrosion involves
incorporating strong carbide formers or stabilizing elements such as niobium or
titanium in the stainless steels. Such elements have a much greater affinity
for carbon than does chromium; carbide formation with these elements reduces
the carbon available in the alloy for formation of chromium_carbides. Such a
stabilized titanium-bearing austenitic chromium-nickel-copper stainless steel
is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,562,781. Or the stainless steel may initially be
reduced in carbon content below 0.03 percent so that insufficient carbon is
provided for carbide formation. These techniques are expensive and only
partially effective since sensitization may occur with time. The low-carbon
steels also frequently exhibit lower strengths at high temperatures.
