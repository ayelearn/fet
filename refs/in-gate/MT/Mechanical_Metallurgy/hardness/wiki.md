Resistance to localized plastic deformation from mechanical indentation or
abrasion
For other uses of "Hardness", see Hard_(disambiguation). "Softness" redirects
here: for other uses, see Soft_(disambiguation).
Not to be confused with Hardiness.
Hardness is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation
induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Some materials (e.g.
metals) are harder than others (e.g. plastics, wood). Macroscopic hardness is
generally characterized by strong intermolecular_bonds, but the behavior of
solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different
measurements of hardness: scratch hardness, indentation hardness, and rebound
hardness.
Hardness is dependent on ductility, elastic stiffness, plasticity, strain,
strength, toughness, viscoelasticity, and viscosity.
Common examples of hard matter are ceramics, concrete, certain metals, and
superhard_materials, which can be contrasted with soft_matter.

***** Measuring hardness[edit] *****
A Vickers hardness tester
There are three main types of hardness measurements: scratch, indentation, and
rebound. Within each of these classes of measurement there are individual
measurement scales. For practical reasons conversion_tables are used to convert
between one scale and another.
**** Scratch hardness[edit] ****
Main article: Scratch_hardness
Scratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to fracture or
permanent plastic_deformation due to friction from a sharp object.[1] The
principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object
made of a softer material. When testing coatings, scratch hardness refers to
the force necessary to cut through the film to the substrate. The most common
test is Mohs_scale, which is used in mineralogy. One tool to make this
measurement is the sclerometer.
Another tool used to make these tests is the pocket hardness tester. This tool
consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled
carriage. A scratch tool with a sharp rim is mounted at a predetermined angle
to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass is added to
the scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across
the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to
be applied without the need for complicated machinery.[2]
**** Indentation hardness[edit] ****
Main article: Indentation_hardness
Indentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material
deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object. Tests for
indentation hardness are primarily used in engineering and metallurgy fields.
The tests work on the basic premise of measuring the critical dimensions of an
indentation left by a specifically dimensioned and loaded indenter.
Common indentation hardness scales are Rockwell, Vickers, Shore, and Brinell,
amongst others.
**** Rebound hardness[edit] ****
Rebound hardness, also known as dynamic hardness, measures the height of the
"bounce" of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto a
material. This type of hardness is related to elasticity. The device used to
take this measurement is known as a scleroscope.[3]
Two scales that measures rebound hardness are the Leeb_rebound_hardness_test
and Bennett_hardness_scale.
Ultrasonic_Contact_Impedance (UCI) method determines hardness by measuring the
frequency of an oscillating rod. The rod consists of a metal shaft with
vibrating element and a pyramid-shaped diamond mounted on one end.[4]
***** Hardening[edit] *****
Main article: Hardening_(metallurgy)
There are five hardening processes: Hall-Petch_strengthening, work_hardening,
solid_solution_strengthening, precipitation_hardening, and martensitic
transformation.
***** Physics[edit] *****

(force applied per unit area) and strain or deformation of a ductile metal.
In solid_mechanics, solids generally have three responses to force, depending
on the amount of force and the type of material:
    * They exhibit elasticityâthe ability to temporarily change shape, but
      return to the original shape when the pressure is removed. "Hardness" in
      the elastic rangeâa small temporary change in shape for a given
      forceâis known as stiffness in the case of a given object, or a high
      elastic_modulus in the case of a material.
    * They exhibit plasticityâthe ability to permanently change shape in
      response to the force, but remain in one piece. The yield_strength is the
      point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation.
      Deformation in the plastic range is non-linear, and is described by the
      stress-strain_curve. This response produces the observed properties of
      scratch and indentation hardness, as described and measured in materials
      science. Some materials exhibit both elasticity and viscosity when
      undergoing plastic deformation; this is called viscoelasticity.
    * They fractureâsplit into two or more pieces.
Strength is a measure of the extent of a material's elastic range, or elastic
and plastic ranges together. This is quantified as compressive_strength, shear
strength, tensile_strength depending on the direction of the forces involved.
Ultimate_strength is an engineering measure of the maximum load a part of a
specific material and geometry can withstand.
Brittleness, in technical usage, is the tendency of a material to fracture with
very little or no detectable plastic deformation beforehand. Thus in technical
terms, a material can be both brittle and strong. In everyday usage
"brittleness" usually refers to the tendency to fracture under a small amount
of force, which exhibits both brittleness and a lack of strength (in the
technical sense). For perfectly brittle materials, yield strength and ultimate
strength are the same, because they do not experience detectable plastic
deformation. The opposite of brittleness is ductility.
The toughness of a material is the maximum amount of energy it can absorb
before fracturing, which is different from the amount of force that can be
applied. Toughness tends to be small for brittle materials, because elastic and
plastic deformations allow materials to absorb large amounts of energy.
Hardness increases with decreasing particle_size. This is known as the Hall-
Petch_relationship. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases
with decreasing grain size. This is known as the inverse Hall-Petch effect.
Hardness of a material to deformation is dependent on its microdurability or
small-scale shear_modulus in any direction, not to any rigidity or stiffness
properties such as its bulk_modulus or Young's_modulus. Stiffness is often
confused for hardness.[5][6] Some materials are stiffer than diamond (e.g.
osmium) but are not harder, and are prone to spalling and flaking in squamose
or acicular habits.
**** Mechanisms and theory[edit] ****
A representation of the crystal lattice showing the planes of atoms.
The key to understanding the mechanism behind hardness is understanding the
metallic microstructure, or the structure and arrangement of the atoms at the
atomic level. In fact, most important metallic properties critical to the
manufacturing of todayâs goods are determined by the microstructure of a
material.[7] At the atomic level, the atoms in a metal are arranged in an
orderly three-dimensional array called a crystal_lattice. In reality, however,
a given specimen of a metal likely never contains a consistent single crystal
lattice. A given sample of metal will contain many grains, with each grain
having a fairly consistent array pattern. At an even smaller scale, each grain
contains irregularities.
There are two types of irregularities at the grain level of the microstructure
that are responsible for the hardness of the material. These irregularities are
point defects and line defects. A point defect is an irregularity located at a
single lattice site inside of the overall three-dimensional lattice of the
grain. There are three main point defects. If there is an atom missing from the
array, a vacancy_defect is formed. If there is a different type of atom at the
lattice site that should normally be occupied by a metal atom, a substitutional
defect is formed. If there exists an atom in a site where there should normally
not be, an interstitial_defect is formed. This is possible because space exists
between atoms in a crystal lattice. While point defects are irregularities at a
single site in the crystal lattice, line defects are irregularities on a plane
of atoms. Dislocations are a type of line defect involving the misalignment of
these planes. In the case of an edge dislocation, a half plane of atoms is
wedged between two planes of atoms. In the case of a screw dislocation two
planes of atoms are offset with a helical array running between them.[8]
In glasses, hardness seems to depend linearly on the number of topological
constraints acting between the atoms of the network.[9] Hence, the rigidity
theory has allowed predicting hardness values with respect to composition.
Planes of atoms split by an edge dislocation.
Dislocations provide a mechanism for planes of atoms to slip and thus a method
for plastic or permanent deformation.[7] Planes of atoms can flip from one side
of the dislocation to the other effectively allowing the dislocation to
traverse through the material and the material to deform permanently. The
movement allowed by these dislocations causes a decrease in the material's
hardness.
The way to inhibit the movement of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder,
involves the interaction of dislocations with each other and interstitial
atoms. When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no
longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations
creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to
slip over one another[10] A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction
with interstitial atoms. If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more
interstitial atoms, the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The
interstitial atoms create anchor points, or pinning points, in the same manner
as intersecting dislocations.
By varying the presence of interstitial atoms and the density of dislocations,
a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter-
intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more
intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more
interstitial atoms are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of
dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder
the material will become.
