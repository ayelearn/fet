In materials_science, superplasticity is a state in which solid crystalline
material is deformed well beyond its usual breaking point, usually over about
2000% during tensile deformation. Such a state is usually achieved at high
homologous_temperature. Examples of superplastic materials are some fine-
grained metals and ceramics. Other non-crystalline materials (amorphous) such
as silica glass ("molten glass") and polymers also deform similarly, but are
not called superplastic, because they are not crystalline; rather, their
deformation is often described as Newtonian_fluid. Superplastically deformed
material gets thinner in a very uniform manner, rather than forming a "neck" (a
local narrowing) that leads to fracture.[1] Also, the formation of microvoids,
which is another cause of early fracture, is inhibited.[citation_needed]
In metals and ceramics, requirements for it being superplastic include a fine
grain size (less than approximately 20 micrometres) and a fine dispersion of
thermally stable particles, which act to pin the grain boundaries and maintain
the fine grain structure at the high temperatures and existence of two phases
required for superplastic deformation. Those materials that meet these
parameters must still have a strain rate sensitivity (a measurement of the way
the stress on a material reacts to changes in strain rate) of >0.3 to be
considered superplastic.
The mechanisms of superplasticity in metals are still under debateâmany
believe it relies on atomic diffusion and the sliding of grains past each
other. Also, when metals are cycled around their phase transformation, internal
stresses are produced and superplastic-like behaviour develops. Recently, high-
temperature superplastic behaviour has also been observed in iron_aluminides
with coarse grain structures. It is claimed that this is due to recovery and
dynamic recrystallization.[2]

***** Advantages of superplastic forming[edit] *****
The process offers a range of important benefits, from both the design and
production angles. To begin with there is the ability to form components with
double curvature and smooth contours from single sheet in one operation, with
exceptional dimensional accuracy and surface finish, and none of the "spring
back" associated with cold_forming techniques. Because only single surface
tools are employed, lead times are short and prototyping is both rapid and
easy, because a range of sheet alloy thicknesses can be tested on the same
tool.
***** Forming techniques[edit] *****
There are three forming techniques currently in use to exploit these
advantages. The method chosen depends upon design and performance criteria such
as size, shape, and alloy characteristics.
**** Cavity forming[edit] ****
A graphite-coated blank is put into a heated hydraulic press. Air_pressure is
then used to force the sheet into close contact with the mould. At the
beginning, the blank is brought into contact with the die cavity, hindering the
forming process by the blank/die interface friction. Thus, the contact areas
divide the single bulge into a number of bulges, which are undergoing a free
bulging process. The procedure allows the production of parts with relatively
exact outer contours. This forming process is suitable for the manufacturing of
parts with smooth, convex surfaces.
**** Bubble forming[edit] ****
A graphite coated blank is clamped over a 'tray' containing a heated male
mould. Air_pressure forces the metal into close contact with the mould. The
difference between this and the female forming process is that the mould is, as
stated, male and the metal is forced over the protruding form. For the female
forming the mould is female and the metal is forced into the cavity. The
tooling consists of two pressure Chambers and a counter punch, which is
linearly displaceable. Similar to the cavity forming technology, at the process
beginning, the firmly clamped blank is bulged by gas pressure.
The second phase of the process involves the material being formed over the
punch surface by applying a pressure against the previous forming direction.
Due to a better material use, which is caused by process conditions, blanks
with a smaller initial thickness compared to cavity forming can be used. Thus,
the bubble forming technology is particularly suitable for parts with high
forming depths.
**** Diaphragm forming[edit] ****
A graphite coated blank is placed into a heated press. Air_pressure is used to
force the metal into a bubble shape before the male mold is pushed into the
underside of the bubble to make an initial impression. Air pressure is then
used from the other direction to final form the metal around the male mould.
This process has long cycle times because the superplastic strain rates are
low. Product also suffers from poor creep performance due to the small grain
sizes and there can be cavitation porosity in some alloys. Surface texture is
generally good however. With dedicated tooling, dies and machines are costly.
The main advantage of the process is that it can be used to produce large
complex components in one operation. This can be useful for keeping the mass
down and avoiding the need for assembly work, a particular advantage for
aerospace products. For example, the diaphragm-forming method (DFM) can be used
to reduce the tensile flow stress generated in a specific alloy matrix
composite during deformation.
***** Aluminium and aluminium based alloys[edit] *****
Super plastically formed (SPF) aluminium alloys have the ability to be
stretched to several times their original size without failure when heated to
between 470 and 520 Â°C.These dilute alloys containing zirconium, later to be
known by the trade name SUPRAL, were heavily cold worked to sheet and
dynamically crystallized to a fine stable grain size, typically 4â5 Î¼m,
during the initial stages of hot deformation. Also superplastic forming is a
net-shape processing technology that dramatically decreases fabrication and
assembly costs by reducing the number of parts and the assembly requirements.
Using SPF technology. It was anticipated that a 50% manufacturing cost
reduction can be achieved for many aircraft assemblies, such as the nose cone
and nose barrel assemblies. Other spin-offs include weight reduction,
elimination of thousands of fasteners, elimination of complex featuring and a
significant reduction in the number of parts. The breakthrough for superplastic
Al-Cu alloys was made by Stowell, Watts and Grimes in 1969 when the first of
several dilute aluminium alloys (Al-6% Cu-0.5%Zr) was rendered superplastic
with the introduction of relatively high levels of zirconium in solution using
specialized casting techniques and subsequent electrical treatment to create
extremely fine ZrAl3 precipitates.
**** Commercial alloys[edit] ****
Some commercial alloys have been thermo-mechanically processed to develop
superplasticity. The main effort has been on the Al 7000 series alloys, Al-Li
alloys, Al-based metal-matrix composites, and mechanically alloyed materials.
**** Aluminium alloy composites[edit] ****
Aluminium alloy and its composites have wide applications in automotive
industries. At room temperature, composites usually have higher strength
compared to the its component alloy. At high temperature, aluminium alloy
reinforced by particles or whiskers such as SiO2, Si3N4, and SiC can have
tensile elongation more than 700%. The composites are often fabricated by
powder metallurgy to ensure fine grain sizes and the good dispersion of
reinforcements.[3] The grain size that allows the optimal superplastic
deformation to happen is usually 0.5~1 Î¼m , less than the requirement of
conventional superplasticity. Just like other superplastic materials, the
strain rate sensitivity (m) is larger than 0.3, indicating good resistance
against local necking phenomenon. A few alumiunium alloy composites such as
6061 series and 2024 series have showed high strain rate superplasticity, which
happens in much higher strain rate region than other superplastic materials.[4]
This property makes aluminium alloy composites potentially suitable for
superplastic forming because the whole process can be done in a short time,
thus saving time and energy.
*** Deformation mechanism for aluminium alloy composites[edit] ***
The most common deformation mechanism in aluminium alloy composites is grain
boundary sliding (GBS), which is often accompanied by atom/dislocation
diffusion to accommodate deformation.[5] The GBS mechanism model predicts a
strain rate sensitivity of 0.3, which agrees with most of the superplastic
aluminium alloy composites. Grain boundary sliding requires the rotation or
migration of very fine grains at relatively high temperature. Therefore, the
refinement of grain size and the prevention of grain growth at high temperature
is of importance.
The very high temperature (close to melting point) is also said to be related
to another mechanism, interfacial sliding. Because at high temperatures,
partial liquids appear in the matrix. The viscosity of the liquid plays the
main role to accommodate the sliding of adjacent grain boundaries. The
cavitation and stress concentration caused by the addition of second phase
reinforcements are inhibited by the flow of liquid phase. However, too much
liquids lead to voids thus deteriorating the stability of the materials. So
temperature close to but not exceeding too much the initial melting point is
often the optimal temperature. The partial melting could lead to the formation
of filaments at the fracture surface, which can be observed under scanning
electron microscope.[6] The morphology and chemistry of reinforcements also
have influence on the superplasticity of some composites. But no single
criterion has yet been proposed to predict their influences.[7]
*** Methods to improve superplasticity[edit] ***
There are a few ways that have been suggested to optimize the superplastic
deformation for aluminium alloy composites, which are also indicative for other
materials:
   1. Good dispersion of reinforcements. This is also important for the room-
      temperature performance.
   2. Refine the grain size of the matrix. The refinement of the grain size
      creates more grains that can sliding over each other at high temperature,
      facilitating the grain boundary sliding mechanism. This also implies a
      higher optimal strain rate. The trend of increase in strain rate has been
      observed in materials of finer grain sizes. Severe plastic deformation
      like equalâchannel angular pressing has been reported to be able to
      achieve ultra-fine grained materials.[8]
   3. Appropriately choosing the temperature and the strain rate. Some
      composites have to be heated close to melting point, which might have
      opposite effects on other composites.
***** Titanium and titanium based alloys[edit] *****
In the aerospace industry, Titanium alloys such as Tiâ6 Alâ4V find
extensive use in aerospace applications, not only because of their specific
high temperature strength, but also because of the fact that a large number of
these alloys exhibit superplastic behavior. Superplastic sheet thermoforming
has been identified as a standard processing route for the production of
complex shapes, especially and are amenable to superplastic forming (SPF).
However, in these alloys the additions of vanadium make them considerably
expensive and so, there is a need for developing superplastic titanium alloys
with cheaper alloying additions. The Ti-Al-Mn alloy could be such a candidate
material. This alloy shows significant post-uniform deformation at ambient and
near-ambient temperatures.
**** Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy[edit] ****
Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy is currently being used for aero engine components as
well as other aerospace applications by forming through a conventional route
that is typically cost, labour and equipment intensive. The Ti-Al-Mn alloy is a
candidate material for aerospace applications. However, there is virtually
little or no information available on its superplastic forming behaviour. In
this study, the high temperature superplastic bulge forming of the alloy was
studied and the superplastic forming capabilities are demonstrated.
**** The bulging process[edit] ****
The gas pressure bulging of metal sheets has become an important forming
method. As the bulging process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet
material becomes obvious. Many studies were made to obtain the dome height with
respect to the forming time useful to the process designer for the selection of
initial blank thickness as well as non-uniform thinning in the dome after
forming.
**** Case study[edit] ****
The Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy was available in the form of a 1 mm thick cold-
rolled sheet. The chemical composition of the alloy. A 35-ton hydraulic press
was used for the superplastic bulge forming of a hemisphere. A die set-up was
fabricated and assembled with the piping system enabling not only the inert gas
flushing of the die- assembly prior to forming, but also for the forming of
components under reverse pressure, if needed. The schematic diagram of the
superplastic forming set-up used for bulge forming with all necessary
attachments and the photograph of the top (left) and bottom (right) die for
SPF.
A circular sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was cut from the alloy sheet and
the cut surfaces polished to remove burrs. The blank was placed on the die and
the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set
temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought
down further to effect the required blank holder pressure. About 10 minutes
were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to
the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear_variable_differential
transformer (LVDT), fitted at the bottom of the die, was set for recording the
sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure
was stopped and the furnace switched off. The formed components were taken out
when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 Â°C. Easy removal of the
component was possible at this stage. Superplastic bulge forming of hemispheres
were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K
(825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 Â°C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and
0.87 MPa. As the bulge forming process progresses, significant thinning in the
sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the
thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component. The components
were analyzed in terms of the thickness distribution, thickness strain and
thinning factor. Post deformation micro-structural studies were conducted on
the formed components in order to analyze the microstructure in terms of grain
growth, grain elongation, cavitations, etc.
*** Results and discussions[edit] ***
The microstructure of the as-received material with a two-dimensional grain
size of 14 Âµm is shown in Fig. 8. The grain size was determined using the
linear intercept method in both the longitudinal and transverse directions of
the rolled sheet.
Successful superplastic forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures
of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K and argon gas forming pressures of
0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 MPa. A maximum time limit of 250 minutes was given for
the complete forming of the hemispheres. This cut-off time of 250 minutes was
given for practical reasons. Fig. 9 shows a photo-graph of the blank (specimen)
and a bulge formed component (temperature of 1123 K and a forming gas pressure
of 0.6 MPa).
The forming times of successfully formed components at different forming
temperatures and pressures. From the travel of the LVDT fitted at the bottom of
the die (which measured the bulge height/depth) an estimate of the rate of
forming was obtained. It was seen that the rate of forming was rapid initially
and decreased gradually for all the temperature and pressure ranges as reported
in Table 2. At a particular temperature, the forming time reduced as the
forming pressure was increased. Similarly at a given forming pressure, forming
time decreased with an increase in temperature.
The thickness of the bulge profile was measured at 7 points including the
periphery (base) and pole. These points were selected by taking the line
between centre of the hemisphere and base point as reference and offsetting by
15Â° until the pole point was reached. Hence the points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
subtend an angle of 15Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â° and 75Â° respectively with the base
of the hemisphere as shown in Fig. 10. The thickness was measured at each of
these points on the bulge profile by using an ultrasonic technique. The
thickness values for each of the successfully formed hemispherical components.
Fig. 11 shows the pole thickness of fully formed hemispheres as a function of
forming pressure at different temperatures. At a particular temperature the
pole thickness reduced as the forming pressure was increased. For all the cases
studied the pole thickness lay in the range of about 0.3 to 0.4 mm from the
original blank thickness of 1 mm.
The thickness strain, ln(S/S0), where S is the local thickness and S0 is the
initial thickness, was calculated at different locations for all the
successfully formed components. For a particular pressure the thickness strain
reduced as the forming temperature was increased. Fig. 12 shows the thickness
strain, ln(S/S0) as a function of position along the dome cross section in case
of a component formed at 1123 K at a forming pressure of 0.6 MPa.
The post-formed microstructure revealed that there was no significant change in
grain size. Fig. 13 shows the microstructure of the bulge formed component at
the base and the pole for a component formed at a temperature of 1148 K and
forming pressure of 0.6 MPa. These microstructures show no significant change
in grain size.
*** Conclusion[edit] ***
The high temperature deformation behaviour and superplastic forming capability
of a Ti-Al-Mn alloy was studied. Successful forming of 90 mm diameter
hemispheres using the superplastic route were carried out at the temperature
range of 1098 to 1223 K and forming pressure range of 0.2 to 0.8 MPa. The
following conclusions could be drawn:
   1. The forming time decreased steeply when the gas pressure or temperature
      was increased. The rate of forming was initially high, but reduced
      progressively with time.
   2. At a particular temperature the pole thickness reduced as the forming
      pressure was increased. For all the cases studied the pole thickness lay
      in the range of about 0.3 to 0.4 mm from the original blank thickness of
      1.0 mm.
   3. The thinning factor and thickness strain increased as one moved from the
      periphery to the pole. The post-formed microstructures show no
      significant change in grain size.
***** Iron and steel[edit] *****
Mostly on non-qualified materials, such as austenitic steel of the FeâMnâAl
alloy, which has some of the specific material parameters closely related to
micro structural mechanisms. These parameters are used as indicators of
material super plastic potentiality. The material was submitted to hot tensile
testing, within a temperature range from 600 Â°C to 1000 Â°C and strainârates
varying from 10â6 to 1âsâ1. The strain rate sensitivity parameter (m) and
observed maximum elongation until rupture (Îµr) could be determined and also
obtained from the hot tensile test.
**** Fe with Mn and Al alloys[edit] ****
The experiments stated a possibility of super plastic behaviour in a
FeâMnâAl alloy within a temperature range from 700 Â°C to 900 Â°C with
grain size around 3 Î¼m (ASTM grain size 12) and average strain rate
sensitivity of m â¼ 0.54, as well as a maximum elongation at rupture around
600%.
**** Fe with Al and Ti alloys[edit] ****
The super plasticity behaviour of Fe-28Al, Fe-28Al-2Ti and Fe-28Al-4Ti alloys
has been investigated by tensile testing, optical microscopy and transmission
electron microscopy. Tensile tests were performed at 700â900 Â°C under a
strain rate range of about 10â5â10â2/s. The maximum strain rate
sensitivity index m was found to be 0.5 and the largest elongation reached
620%. In Fe3Al and Fe Al alloys with grain sizes of 100â600Î¼m. The large-
grained Fe3Al and Fe Al alloys exhibit all deformation characteristics of
conventional fine grain size super plastic alloys.
However, super plastic behaviour was found in large-grained iron_aluminides
without the usual prerequisites for the super plasticity of a fine grain size
and grain boundary sliding. The metallographic examinations have shown that the
average grain size of large-grained iron aluminides decreased during super
plastic_deformation.
***** Ceramics[edit] *****
**** The properties of ceramics[edit] ****
The properties of ceramic materials, like all materials, are dictated by the
types of atoms present, the types of bonding between the atoms, and the way the
atoms are packed together. This is known as the atomic scale structure. Most
ceramics are made up of two or more elements. This is called a compound. For
example, alumina (Al2O3), is a compound made up of aluminium atoms and oxygen
atoms.
The atoms in ceramic materials are held together by a chemical bond. The two
most common chemical bonds for ceramic materials are covalent and ionic. For
metals, the chemical bond is called the metallic bond. The bonding of atoms
together is much stronger in covalent and ionic bonding than in metallic. That
is why, generally speaking, metals are ductile and ceramics are brittle. Due to
ceramic materials wide range of properties, they are used for a multitude of
applications. In general, most ceramics are:
    * hard
    * wear-resistant
    * brittle
    * refractory
    * thermal insulators
    * electrical insulator
    * nonmagnetic
    * oxidation resistant
    * prone to thermal shock
    * good chemical stability
High-strain-rate superplasticity has been observed in aluminium-based and
magnesium-based alloys. But for ceramic materials, superplastic deformation has
been restricted to low strain rates for most oxides, and nitrides with the
presence of cavities leading to premature failure. Here we show that a
composite ceramic material consisting of tetragonal zirconium oxide, magnesium
aluminates spinal and alpha-alumina phase exhibit superplasticity at strain
rates up to 1.0 sâ1. The composite also exhibits a large tensile elongation,
exceeding 1050% or a strain rate of 0.4 sâ1. Superplastic metals and ceramics
have the ability to deform over 100% without fracturing, permitting net-shape
forming at high temperatures. These intriguing materials deform primarily by
grain boundary sliding, a process accelerated with a fine grain size. However,
most ceramics that start with a fine grain size experience rapid grain growth
during high temperature deformation, rendering them unsuitable for extended
superplastic forming. One can limit grain growth using a minor second phase
(Zener pinning) or by making a ceramic with three phases, where grain to grain
contact of the same phase is minimized. A research on fine grain three phase
alumina-mullite(3Al2O3â¢2SiO2)-zirconia, with approximately equal volume
fractions of the three phases, demonstrates that superplastic strain rates as
high as 10â2/sec at 1500 Â°C can be reached. These high strain rates put
ceramic superplastic forming into the realm of commercial feasibility.
**** Cavitations[edit] ****
Superplastic forming will only work if cavitations don't occur during grain
boundary sliding, those cavitations leaving either diffusion accommodation or
dislocation generation as mechanisms for accommodating grain boundary sliding.
The applied stresses during ceramic superplastic forming are moderate, usually
20â50 MPa, usually not high enough to generate dislocations in single
crystals, so that should rule out dislocation accommodation. Some unusual and
unique features of these three phase superplastic ceramics will be revealed,
however, indicating that superplastic ceramics may have a lot more in common
with metals than previously thought.
**** Yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline[edit] ****
Yttrium oxide is used as the stabilizer. This material is predominantly
tetragonal in structure. Y-TZP has the highest flexural strength of all the
zirconia based materials. The fine grain size of Y-TZP lends itself to be used
in cutting tools where a very sharp edge can be achieved and maintained due to
its high wear resistance. It is considered to be the first true polycrystalline
ceramic shown to be superplastic with a 3-mol % Y-TZP (3Y-TZP), which is now
considered to be the model ceramic system. The fine grade size leads to a very
dense, non-porous ceramic with excellent mechanical strength, corrosion
resistance, impact toughness, thermal shock resistance and very low thermal
conductivity. Due to its characteristics Y-TZP is used in wear parts, cutting
tools and thermal barrier coatings.
**** Grain size[edit] ****
Superplastic properties of 3Y-TZP is greatly affected by grain size as
displaced in Fig. 3, elongation to failure decreases and flow strength
increases while grain size increases. A study was made on the dependence of
flow_stress on grain size, the result âin summary- shows that the flow stress
approximately depends on the grain size squared:
         &#x03C3; &#x221D;  d  2      {\displaystyle \sigma \propto d^{2}\,}
      [\sigma \propto d^{2}\,]
Where:
         &#x03C3;    {\displaystyle \sigma \,}  [\sigma \,] is the flow stress.
      d is the instantaneous grain size.
***** Alumina (Al2O3)[edit] *****
Alumina is probably one of the most widely used structural ceramics, but
superplasticity is difficult to obtain in alumina, as a result of rapid
anisotropic grain growth during high-temperature deformation. Regardless of
which, several studies have been performed on superplasticity in doped, fine-
grain Al2O3 .Demonstrated that the grain size of Al2O3 containing 500-ppm MgO
can be further refined by adding various dopants, such as Cr2O3, Y2O3, and
TiO2. A grain size of about 0.66 Âµm was obtained in a 500-ppm Y23-doped Al2O3.
As a result of this fine grain size, the Al2O3 exhibits a rupture elongation of
65% at 1450 Â°C under an applied stress of 20 MPa.[9]
