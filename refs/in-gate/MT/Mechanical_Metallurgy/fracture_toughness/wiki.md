In materials_science, fracture toughness is a property which describes the
ability of a material to resist fracture, and is one of the most important
properties of any material for many design applications. The linear-elastic
fracture toughness of a material is determined from the stress_intensity_factor
(    K   {\displaystyle K}  [K]) at which a thin crack in the material begins
to grow. It is denoted KIc and has the units of      Pa     m
{\displaystyle {\text{Pa}}{\sqrt {\rm {m}}}}  [\text{Pa}\sqrt{\rm{m}}] or
psi     i n      {\displaystyle {\text{psi}}{\sqrt {\rm {in}}}}  [\text
{psi}\sqrt{\rm{in}}]. Plastic-elastic fracture toughness is denoted by JIc,
with the unit of J/cm2 or lbf-in/in2, and is a measurement of the energy
required to grow a thin crack.
The subscript I denotes mode I crack opening under a normal tensile stress
perpendicular to the crack, since the material can be made deep enough to stand
shear (mode II) or tear (mode III).
Fracture toughness is a quantitative way of expressing a material's resistance
to brittle fracture when a crack is present. A material with high fracture
toughness may undergo ductile fracture as opposed to brittle fracture. Brittle
fracture is characteristic of materials with low fracture toughness.[1]
Fracture_mechanics, which leads to the concept of fracture toughness, was
broadly based on the work of A._A._Griffith who, among other things, studied
the behavior of cracks in brittle materials.
A related concept is the work of fracture (     &#x03B3;  w o f
{\displaystyle \gamma _{wof}}  [\gamma_{wof}]) which is directly proportional
to      K  I c   2    /  E   {\displaystyle K_{Ic}^{2}/E}  [K_{Ic}^2/E], where
E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] is the Young's modulus of the material.[2] Note
that, in SI units,      &#x03B3;  w o f     {\displaystyle \gamma _{wof}}
[\gamma_{wof}] is given in J/m2.

***** Fracture toughness and materials class[edit] *****
Fracture toughness vs. Yield strength
Just as the elastic properties of materials, like elastic moduli and strength,
vary among material class, so too does the fracture toughness. Figure 1 graphs
the fracture toughness vs. strength for various materials and materials
classes.[3] However, unlike most elastic properties, fracture toughness
displays a wide variation across materials, about 4 orders of magnitude. As can
be expected, metals hold the highest values of fracture toughness. Since cracks
cannot easily propagate in tough materials, this makes metals highly resistant
to cracking under stress and gives their stressâstrain curve a large zone of
plastic flow. Comparatively, engineering ceramics have a lower fracture
toughness, which leads to ease of cracking, but show an exceptional improvement
in the stress fracture that is attributed to their 1.5 orders of magnitude
strength increase, relative to metals. Of note is the fracture toughness of
composites (made by combining engineering ceramics with engineering polymers)
(in the zone of engineering alloys), which greatly exceeds the individual
fracture toughness of the constituent materials.
Within material groups (classes) there is a further subdivision that depends on
the relation between strength and toughness between different material
subgroups. The ovals, or "balloons" within each material class tend to have a
sloping trend that describes the subgroup's strength-toughness relationship.
For example, take the alloy system's downward sloping trend. This relationship
indicates, that within an alloy class an increase in strength leads to a
decrease in fracture toughness regardless of the strengthening mechanism used.
For this reason, it is beneficial to think of an increase in strength (within
the engineering alloys) as a direct decrease in fracture toughness, which is
correlated with a lower ductility of the material. This, however, is not the
trend for other material classes. As a first example, consider the polymer
foams and porous ceramics. In direct contrast to alloys, the trend in this
material class is to have an upward slope. Explicitly, when the strength of
these materials is increased we can expect to see an accompanied increase in
fracture Yitoughness. Indeed, in the subgroup of balsa and ash we observe a
close to one order of magnitude increase in both properties. Porous ceramics
have been shown to behave exactly like this under both compression stress and
tensile stress, however, the fracture toughness values are ten times lower
under tension. This behavior can most easily be grasped by considering the
porosity of these materials, where these voids can be modeled as preexisting
cracks, which increase the nucleation energy of cracks under stress and impede
the propagation of these cracks. Note that the engineering ceramics also show
the same sloping trend as the porous ceramics, however, the slope is much
greater, which makes it less noticeable in the log-scale.
In general, materials that are on the upper-leftmost part of the diagram are
used to design a system's failure against flow, because these materials yield
before they are fractured. While materials on the lower rightmost part of the
diagram are used to design a system's failure against fracture, because these
materials fracture before yielding.

***** Stability of crack growth[edit] *****
Consider a body with flaws (cracks) that is subject to a load; the stability of
the crack can be assessed as follows. We can assume for simplicity that the
loading is of constant displacement or displacement controlled type (such as
loading with a screw jack); we can also simplify the discussion by
characterizing the crack by its area, A. If we consider an adjacent state of
the body as being one with a broader crack (area A+dA), we can then assess
strain energy in the two states and evaluate strain_energy_release_rate.
The rate is reckoned with respect to the change in crack area, so if we use U
for strain_energy, the strain_energy_release_rate is numerically dU/dA. It may
be noted that for a body loaded in constant displacement mode, the displacement
is applied and the force level is dictated by stiffness (or compliance) of the
body. If the crack grows in size, the stiffness decreases, so the force level
will decrease. This decrease in force level under the same displacement
(strain) level indicates that the elastic strain_energy stored in the body is
decreasingâis being released. Hence the term strain energy release rate which
is usually denoted with symbol G.
The strain energy release rate is higher for higher loads and broader cracks.
If the strain energy so released exceeds a critical value Gc, then the crack
will grow spontaneously. For brittle materials, Gc can be equated to the
surface_energy of the (two) new crack surfaces; in other words, in brittle
materials, a crack will grow spontaneously if the strain energy released is
equal to or more than the energy required to grow the crack surface(s). The
stability condition can be written as
      elastic energy released = surface energy created.
If the elastic_energy released is less than the critical value, then the crack
will not grow; equality signifies neutral stability and if the strain energy
release rate exceeds the critical value, the crack will start growing in an
unstable manner. For ductile materials, energy associated with plastic
deformation has to be taken into account. When there is plastic_deformation at
the crack tip (as occurs most often in metals) the energy to propagate the
crack may increase by several orders of magnitude as the work related to
plastic deformation may be much larger than the surface_energy. In such cases,
the stability criterion has to be restated as
      elastic energy released = surface energy + plastic deformation energy.
The problem can also be formulated in terms of stress instead of energy,
leading to the terms stress_intensity_factor K (or KI for mode I) and critical
stress intensity factor Kc (and KIc). These Kc and KIc (etc.) quantities are
commonly referred to as fracture toughness, though it is equivalent to use Gc.
Typical values for KIcare 150 MN/m3/2 for ductile (very tough) metals, 25 for
brittle ones and 1â10 for glasses and brittle polymers. Notice the different
units used by GIc and KIc. Engineers tend to use the latter as an indication of
toughness.
***** Conjoint action[edit] *****
There are a number of instances where this picture of a critical crack is
modified by corrosion. Thus, fretting_corrosion occurs when a corrosive medium
is present at the interface between two rubbing surfaces. Fretting (in the
absence of corrosion) results from the disruption of very small areas that bond
and break as the surfaces undergo friction, often under vibrating conditions.
The bonding contact areas deform under the localised pressure and the two
surfaces gradually wear away. Fracture mechanics dictates that each minute
localised fracture has to satisfy the general rule that the elastic energy
released as the bond fractures has to exceed the work done in plastically
deforming it and in creating the (very tiny) fracture surfaces. This process is
enhanced when corrosion is present, not least because the corrosion products
act as an abrasive between the rubbing surfaces.
Fatigue is another instance where cyclical stressing, this time of a bulk lump
of metal, causes small flaws to develop. Ultimately one such flaw exceeds the
critical condition and fracture propagates across the whole structure. The
fatigue life of a component is the time it takes for criticality to be reached,
for a given regime of cyclical stress. Corrosion fatigue is what happens when a
cyclically stressed structure is subjected to a corrosive environment at the
same time. This not only serves to initiate surface cracks but (see below)
actually modifies the crack growth process. As a result, the fatigue life is
shortened, often considerably.
***** Stress-corrosion cracking (SCC)[edit] *****
Main article: Stress_corrosion_cracking
This phenomenon is the unexpected sudden failure of normally ductile metals
subjected to a constant tensile_stress in a corrosive environment. Certain
austenitic stainless_steels and aluminium alloys crack in the presence of
chlorides, mild steel cracks in the presence of alkali (boiler cracking) and
copper alloys crack in ammoniacal solutions (season cracking). Worse still,
high-tensile structural steels crack in an unexpectedly brittle manner in a
whole variety of aqueous environments, especially chloride. With the possible
exception of the latter, which is a special example of hydrogen_cracking, all
the others display the phenomenon of subcritical crack growth; i.e. small
surface flaws propagate (usually smoothly) under conditions where fracture
mechanics predicts that failure should not occur. That is, in the presence of a
corrodent, cracks develop and propagate well below KIc. In fact, the
subcritical value of the stress intensity, designated as KIscc, may be less
than 1% of KIc, as the following table shows:
           KIc (    M N  /   m  3  /                  KIscc (    M N  /   m  3
   Alloy   2     {\displaystyle MN/  SCC environment  /  2     {\displaystyle
            m^{3/2}}  [MN/m^{3/2}])                  MN/m^{3/2}}  [MN/m^{3/2}])

The subcritical nature of propagation may be attributed to the chemical energy
released as the crack propagates. That is,
      elastic energy released + chemical energy = surface energy + deformation
      energy.
The crack initiates at KIscc and thereafter propagates at a rate governed by
the slowest process, which most of the time is the rate at which corrosive ions
can diffuse to the crack tip. As the crack advances so K rises (because crack
size appears in the calculation of stress intensity). Finally it reaches KIc,
whereupon swift fracture ensues and the component fails. One of the practical
difficulties with SCC is its unexpected nature. Stainless_steels, for example,
are employed because under most conditions they are passive; i.e. effectively
inert. Very often one finds a single crack has propagated whiles the left metal
surface stays apparently unaffected.
***** Toughening mechanisms[edit] *****
**** Intrinsic mechanisms[edit] ****
Intrinsic toughening mechanisms are processes which act ahead of the crack tip
to increase the material's toughness. These will tend to be related to the
structure and bonding of the base material, as well as microstructural features
and additives to it. Examples of mechanisms include crack deflection by
secondary phases, crack bifurcation due to fine grain_structure and
modification to the grain boundaries, and crack meandering by pores in the
material. Any alteration to the base material which increases its ductility can
also be thought of as intrinsic toughening.[9]
**** Extrinsic mechanisms[edit] ****
Extrinsic toughening mechanisms are processes which act behind the crack tip to
resist its further opening. Examples include fibre/lamella bridging, where
these structures hold the two fracture surfaces together after the crack has
propagated through the matrix, crack wedging from the friction between two
rough fracture surfaces, microcracking, where smaller cracks form in the
material around the main crack, relieving the stress at the crack tip by
effectively increasing the material's compliance, and transformation
toughening.[10]
"Transformation toughening" is a phenomenon whereby a material undergoes one or
more martensitic (displacive, diffusionless) phase transformations which result
in an almost instantaneous change in volume of that material. This
transformation is triggered by a change in the stress state of the material,
such as an increase in tensile stress, and acts in opposition to the applied
stress. Thus when the material is locally put under tension, for example at the
tip of a growing crack, it can undergo a phase transformation which increases
its volume, lowering the local tensile stress and hindering the crack's
progression through the material. This mechanism is exploited to increase the
toughness of ceramic materials, most notably in Yttria-stabilized_zirconia for
applications such as ceramic knives and thermal barrier coatings on jet engine
turbine blades.[11]
This martensitic transformation occurs as a result of stress and parallels
elastic transformation, it is also quite similar to the transformation that
occurs within TRIP steels, but that martensitic transformation is a result of
plastic strain. The two phases that exist within pure Zirconia are the
tetragonal form at high temperature, and the monoclinic form at low
temperature. The transformation in pure Zirconia contains significant shear
(ca. 7%) and dilatational strains (ca. 4%). Thermal cracking and even loss of
key structural principles can result from these strains if cooling occurs
rapidly. Additionally, cooling induces this transformation sluggishly as only a
small fraction of the tetragonal form actually transforms. For specific PSZ
compositions, the transformation transition temperature falls below room
temperature with stress assistance. Figure 1 illustrates the transformation
induced via a crack and its corresponding stress field. If tetragonal particles
lie within one radius (rc) of the crack fracture plane, certain particles
transform into the monoclinic phase, and the material toughness increases as a
result of the work invested into the transformation process.[12]
Visual representation of transformation toughened pure Zirconia. The crack
induces a stress intensification that results in the transformation of some
tetragonal particles into monoclinic phase particles that lie within the one rc
zone.
The toughness contributed from transformation toughness is quite analogous to
that from crack toughening, and the equations involved will be quite similar.
Key parameters include the stress, which induces the transformation, the
transformational strain, and the composition within one rc of the crack. This
distance is dependent upon the fracture toughness of the matrix along with the
inducing stress. Furthermore, the phenomena within transformation toughening
also parallel those within microcrack toughening. The grain-size effect of
microcrack toughness is quite analogous to the particle-size effect prevalent
within transformation toughening. This causes the stress required to initiate
martensitic transformation to decrease with increasing tetragonal particle size
due to the fact that larger particles result in a lower constraint from the
cubic matrix on the transformation. For particularly large particle sizes, the
transformation can spontaneously occur while cooling, yet again similar to the
spontaneous crack formation in microcrack toughness. However, toughness can
also become too low if particle size is too small resulting in a decreased rc
due to higher stresses since rc ~ stressâ2 during cooling. Therefore,
transformational toughness contains an optimum particle size similar to the
optimal grain size present for microcrack toughening.[12]
**** Crack repair[edit] ****
Toughening of a material, such as concrete, which contains numerous pre-
existing cracks can be achieved by crack repair. The repair of cracks is often
carried out through the infiltration under pressure of binders or resin and can
also be achieved by drilling a hole at the crack tip to alleviate stress
concentration. This approach turns a propagating crack in to a keyhole_notch
with a moderated stress concentration [13].
***** Effect of grains and inclusions on crack propagation[edit] *****
**** Propagation of cracks in grains[edit] ****
The presence of grains in a material can affect its toughness by affecting the
way cracks propagate. In front of a crack, a plastic zone can be present as the
material yields. Beyond that region, the material remains elastic. The
conditions for fracture are the most favorable at the boundary between this
plastic and elastic zone, and thus cracks often initiate by the cleavage of a
grain at that location.
At low temperatures, where the material can become completely brittle, such as
in a body-centered cubic (BCC) metal, the plastic zone shrinks away, and only
the elastic zone exists. In this state, the crack will propagate by successive
cleavage of the grains. At these low temperatures, the yield strength is high,
but the fracture strain and crack tip radius of curvature are low, leading to a
low toughness.[12]
At higher temperatures, the yield strength decreases, and leads to the
formation of the plastic zone. Cleavage is likely to initiate at the elastic-
plastic zone boundary, and then link back to the main crack tip. This is
usually a mixture of cleavages of grains, and ductile fracture of grains known
as fibrous linkages. The percentage of fibrous linkages increase as temperature
increases until the linkup is entirely fibrous linkages. In this state, even
though yield strength is lower, the presence of ductile fracture and a higher
crack tip radius of curvature results in a higher toughness.[12]
It is worth noting that depending on the crystal structure, this behavior can
be different. For example, face-centered cubic (FCC) metals remain ductile even
at low temperatures, so a plastic zone is always present.
**** Presence of inclusions[edit] ****
Inclusions in a material such as a second phase particles can act similar to
brittle grains that can affect crack propagation. Fracture or decohesion at the
inclusion can either be caused by the external applied stress or by the
dislocations generated by the requirement of the inclusion to maintain
contiguity with the matrix around it. Similar to grains, the fracture is most
likely to occur at the plastic-elastic zone boundary. Then the crack can linkup
back to the main crack. If the plastic zone is small or the density of the
inclusions is small, the fracture is more likely to directly link up with the
main crack tip. If the plastic zone is large, or the density of inclusions is
high, additional inclusion fractures may occur within the plastic zone, and
linkup occurs by progressing from the crack to the closest fracturing inclusion
within the zone.[12]
***** Fracture toughness testing methods[edit] *****
Fracture toughness tests are performed to quantify the resistance of a material
to failure by cracking. Such tests result in either a single-valued measure of
fracture toughness or in a resistance_curve. Resistance curves are plots where
fracture toughness parameters (K,J etc) are plotted against parameters
characterizing the propagation of crack. The resistance curve or the single-
valued fracture toughness is obtained based on the mechanism and stability of
fracture. Fracture toughness is a critical mechanical property for engineering
applications. There are several types of test used to measure fracture
toughness of materials, which generally utilise a notched specimen in one of
various configurations. A widely utilized standardized test method is the
Charpy_impact_test whereby a sample with a V-notch or a U-notch is subjected to
impact from behind the notch. Also widely used are crack displacement tests
such as three-point beam bending tests with thin cracks preset into test
specimens before applying load.
The immense real-world consequence of failure of materials by fracture has
motivated a variety of organization throughout the world to publish
standardized procedures for fracture toughness measurements, namely ASTM, BSI,
ISO, JSME. No single standard as informed through these organization is
universal, so careful inspection of the standards are required before it can be
applied to a specimen.

**** Prior to testing[edit] ****
There are few common points need to considered before commencing with the
testing of any specimen. The design and orientation of the test specimen is one
of the main points of scrutiny.
ASTM standard describes[14] five specimen configurations, namely compact
specimen, disk-shaped compact specimen, single edge notched bend specimen
(SENB), middle tension and arc-shaped specimen. Each specimen configuration is
characterized by three dimensions, namely the crack length(a), the thickness(B)
and the width(W). The values of these dimensions is determined by the demand of
the particular test that is being performed on the specimen. The vast majority
of the tests are carried out on either compact or SENB configuration. For the
same characteristic dimensions, compact configuration takes a lesser amount of
material compared to SENB.
Orientation of fracture is important because of the inherent non-isotropic
nature of most engineering materials. Due to this, there may be "planes of
weakness" within the material, and crack growth along this plane may be easier
compared to other direction. Due to this importance ASTM has devised a
standardized way of reporting the crack orientation with respect to forging
axis[15]. The letters L, T and S are used to denote longitudinal, transverse
and short transverse direction, where longitudinal direction coincides with
forging axis. The orientation is defined with two letters the first one being
the direction of principal tensile stress and the second one is the direction
of crack propagation. Generally speaking, the lower bound of the toughness of a
material is obtained in the orientation where the crack grows in the direction
of forging axis.
It is imperative to carefully introduce a crack into the specimen to test. To
apply the results of the toughness tests to the theory we need an infinitely
sharp crack prior to loading. The machined cracks do not meet this criterion,
i.e. they have a finite opening at the crack tip. The most effective way of
introducing a sufficiently sharp crack is through cyclic loading. Fatigue
cracks are initiated at the tip of machined cracks and allowed to extend till
the crack length reaches its desired value. The cyclic loading is to be
controlled carefully so as to not affect the actual toughness of the material
through strain-hardening. This is done through choosing the cyclic loads which
produces far smaller plastic zone compared to plastic zone of the main
fracture. For example, according to ASTM E399 standard the maximum stress
intensity Kmax should be no larger than 0.6KIC during the initial stage and
less than 0.8KIC when crack approaches its final size.[16]
In certain cases grooves are machined into the sides of a fracture toughness
specimen so that the thickness of the specimen is reduced to minimum of 80% of
the original thickness along the intended path of crack extensions[17]. The
reason is to maintain a straight crack front during R-curve test.
The four main standardized tests are described below with KIc and KR tests
valid for linear-elastic fracture mechanics(LEFM) while J and JR tests valid
for elastic-plastic fracture mechanics(PEFM)
**** Determination of plane strain fracture toughness, KIc[edit] ****
When a material behaves in a linear elastic way prior to failure, such that the
plastic zone is small compared to the specimen dimension, a critical value of
Mode-I stress intensity factor can be an appropriate fracture parameter. This
method provides a quantitative measure of fracture toughness in terms of the
critical plane_strain stress intensity factor. The test must be validated once
complete to ensure the results are meaningful. The specimen size is fixed, and
must be large enough to ensure plane strain conditions at the crack tip. This
limits the product forms to which the test can be applied.
In the 1960s, it was postulated that small specimens or thin sections fail
under plane stress conditions, and that 'âplane strain fracture'â occurs in
thick sections. The ASTM E 399 test method reflects this viewpoint. Over the
years, it has been taken as an indisputable fact that toughness decreases with
increasing specimen size until a plateau is reached. Specimen size requirements
in ASTM E 399 are intended to ensure that KIc measurements correspond to the
supposed plane strain plateau. The specimen size requirements in this standard
are far more stringent than they need to be to ensure predominately plane
strain conditions at the crack tip. The real key to a K-based test method is
ensuring that the specimen fractures under nominally linear elastic conditions.
That is, the plastic zone must be small compared to the specimen cross section.
Consequently, the important specimen dimensions to ensure a valid K test are
the crack length a and the ligament length W-a, not the thickness B. Four
specimen configurations are permitted by the current version of E 399: the
compact, SE(B), arc-shaped, and disk-shaped specimens. Specimens for KIc tests
are usually fabricated with the width W equal to twice the thickness B. They
are fatigue pre-cracked so that the crack length/width ratio (a /W) lies
between 0.45 and 0.55. Thus, the specimen design is such that all of the key
dimensions, a, B, and Wâa, are approximately equal. This design results in
the efficient use of material, since the standard requires that each of these
dimensions must be large compared to the plastic zone.
  Plane-strain fracture toughness testing
When performing a fracture toughness test, the most common test specimen
configurations are the single edge notch bend (SENB or three-point bend), and
the compact tension (CT) specimens. From the above discussion, it is clear that
an accurate determination of the plane-strain fracture toughness requires a
specimen whose thickness exceeds some critical thickness (B). Testing has shown
that plane-strain conditions generally prevail when:
   B , a &#x2265; 2.5   (    K  I C    &#x03C3;  Y S     )   2
{\displaystyle B,a\geq 2.5\left({\frac {K_{IC}}{\sigma _{YS}}}\right)^{2}}  [
{\displaystyle B,a\geq 2.5\left({\frac {K_{IC}}{\sigma _{YS}}}\right)^{2}}][18]
Where: B    is the minimum thickness that produces a condition where plastic
            strain energy at the crack tip in minimal
       KIC  is the fracture toughness of the material
       ÏYis the yield stress of material
The test is performed by loading steadily at a rate such that KI increases
steadily from 0.55 to 2.75 (MPa      m     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {m}}}  [{\sqrt
{m}}])/s. The load and the crack mouth opening displacement(CMOD) is noted and
the test is continued till the maximum load is reached. The critical load, PQ
is calculated through specialized data reduction method from the load vs CMOD
plot. Then we calculate a provisional toughness KQ given as      K  Q   =    P
Q      W   B    f ( a  /  W , . . . )   {\displaystyle K_{Q}={\frac {P_{Q}}{
{\sqrt {W}}B}}f(a/W,...)}  [{\displaystyle K_{Q}={\frac {P_{Q}}{{\sqrt {W}}B}}f
(a/W,...)}]. The function    f ( a  /  W , . . . )   {\displaystyle f(a/W,...)}
[{\displaystyle f(a/W,...)}] is a dimensionless function of a/W. This function
is given in polynomial form in E 399 standard, Function for compact test
geometry can be found here [19]. This provisional toughness value is recognized
as the valid one when the validity requirements are met, which include
   m i n ( B , a ) > 2.5   (    K  Q    &#x03C3;  Y S     )   2
{\displaystyle min(B,a)>2.5\left({\frac {K_{Q}}{\sigma _{YS}}}\right)^{2}}  [
{\displaystyle min(B,a)>2.5\left({\frac {K_{Q}}{\sigma _{YS}}}\right)^{2}}]and
P  m a x   &#x2264; 1.1  P  Q     {\displaystyle P_{max}\leq 1.1P_{Q}}  [
{\displaystyle P_{max}\leq 1.1P_{Q}}]
When a material of unknown fracture toughness is tested, a specimen of full
material section thickness is tested or the specimen is sized based on a
prediction of the fracture toughness. If the fracture toughness value resulting
from the test does not satisfy the requirement of the above equation, the test
must be repeated using a thicker specimen. In addition to this thickness
calculation, test specifications have several other requirements that must be
met (such as the size of the shear lips) before a test can be said to have
resulted in a KIC value.
When a test fails to meet the thickness and other test requirements that are in
place to insure plane-strain condition, the fracture toughness value produced
is given the designation KC. Sometimes it is not possible to produce a specimen
that meets the thickness requirement. For example, when a relatively thin plate
product with high toughness is being tested, it might not be possible to
produce a thicker specimen with plain-strain conditions at the crack tip.
  Plane-stress and transitional-stress states
For cases where the plastic energy at the crack tip is not negligible, other
fracture mechanics parameters, such as the J integral or R-curve, can be used
to characterize a material. The toughness data produced by these other tests
will be dependent on the thickness of the product tested and will not be a true
material property. However, plane-strain conditions do not exist in all
structural configurations and using KIC values in the design of relatively thin
areas may result in excess conservatism and a weight or cost penalty. In cases
where the actual stress state is plane-stress or, more generally, some
intermediate- or transitional-stress state, it is more appropriate to use J
integral or R-curve data, which account for slow, stable fracture (ductile
tearing) rather than rapid (brittle) fracture.
Uses of plane-strain fracture toughness
KIC values are used to determine the critical crack length when a given stress
is applied to a component.
Where: sc  is the critical applied stress that will cause failure
       KIC is the plane-strain fracture toughness
       Y   is a constant related to the sample's geometry
       a   is the crack length for edge cracks
           or one half crack length for internal crack

**** Determination of fracture toughness R-curve, K-R[edit] ****
The specimen showing stable crack growth shows an increasing trend in fracture
toughness as the crack length increases(ductile crack extension). This plot of
fracture toughness vs crack length is called the resistance(R)-curve. ASTM E561
outlines a procedure for determining toughness vs crack growth curves in
materials[20]. This standard does not have a constraint over the minimum
thickness of the material and hence can be used for thin sheets however the
requirements for LEFM must be fulfilled for the test to be valid. The criteria
for LEFM essentially states that in-plane dimension has to be large compared to
the plastic zone. There is a misconception about the effect of thickness on the
shape of R curve. It is hinted that for the same material thicker section fails
by plane strain fracture and shows a single-valued fracture toughness, the
thinner section fails by plane stress fracture and shows the rising R-curve.
However, the main factor that controls the slope of R curve is the fracture
morphology not the thickness. In some material section thickness changes the
fracture morphology from ductile tearing to cleavage from thin to thick
section, in which case the thickness alone dictates the slope of R-curve. There
are cases where even plane strain fracture ensues in rising R-curve due to
"microvoid coalescence" being the mode of failure.
*** Negligible plastic zone[edit] ***
The most accurate way of evaluating K-R curve is taking presence of plasticity
into account depending on the relative size of the plastic zone. For the case
of negligible plasticity, the load vs displacement curve is obtained from the
test and on each point the compliance is found. The compliance is reciprocal of
the slope of the curve that will be followed if the specimen is unloaded at a
certain point, which can be given as the ratio of displacement to load for
LEFM. The compliance is used to determine the instantaneous crack length
through the relationship given in the ASTM standard. The crack length can also
be measured through optical means. Which is followed by KI calculation using
the formula
    K  I   =   P    W   B    f ( a  /  W , . . . )   {\displaystyle K_{I}=
{\frac {P}{{\sqrt {W}}B}}f(a/W,...)}  [{\displaystyle K_{I}={\frac {P}{{\sqrt
{W}}B}}f(a/W,...)}]-----------------{1]
*** Modification considering plasticity[edit] ***
The stress intensity should be corrected by calculating an effective crack
length. ASTM standard suggests two alternative approaches. The first method is
named Irwin's plastic zone correction. Irwin's approach describes the effective
crack length to be
    a  e f f   = a +   1  2 &#x03C0;      (   K  &#x03C3;  Y S     )   2
{\displaystyle a_{eff}=a+{\frac {1}{2\pi }}\left({\frac {K}{\sigma _
{YS}}}\right)^{2}}  [{\displaystyle a_{eff}=a+{\frac {1}{2\pi }}\left({\frac
{K}{\sigma _{YS}}}\right)^{2}}]where      &#x03C3;  Y S     {\displaystyle
\sigma _{YS}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{YS}}]= Uni-axial yield strength of the
material. -------------------[2] [13]
Irwin's approach leads to an iterative solution as K itself is a function of
crack length.
The other method, namely the secant method, uses the compliance-crack length
equation given by ASTM standard to calculate effective crack length from an
effective compliance. Compliance at any point in Load vs displacement curve is
essentially the reciprocal of the slope of the curve that ensues if the
specimen is unloaded at that point. Now the unloading curve returns to the
origin for linear elastic material but not for elastic plastic material as
there is a permanent deformation. The effective compliance at a point for the
elastic plastic case is taken as the slope of the line joining the point and
origin( i.e the compliance if the material was an elastic one). This effective
compliance is used to get an effective crack growth and the rest of the
calculation follows the equation
    K  I   =   P    W   B    f (  a  e f f    /  W , . . . )   {\displaystyle
K_{I}={\frac {P}{{\sqrt {W}}B}}f(a_{eff}/W,...)}  [{\displaystyle K_{I}={\frac
{P}{{\sqrt {W}}B}}f(a_{eff}/W,...)}]
The choice of plasticity correction is factored on the size of plastic zone.
ASTM standard covering resistance curve suggests using Irwin's method is
acceptable for small plastic zone and recommends using Secant method when
crack-tip plasticity is more prominent. Also since the ASTM E 561 standard does
not contain requirements on the specimen size or maximum allowable crack
extension, thus the size independence of the resistance curve is not
guaranteed. Few studies show that the size dependence is less detected in the
experimental data for the Secant method.[21]
**** Determination of JIC[edit] ****
Strain energy release rate per unit fracture surface area is calculated by J-
integral method which is a contour path integral around the crack tip where the
path begins and ends on either crack surfaces. J-toughness value signifies the
resistance of the material in terms of amount of stress energy required for a
crack to grow. JIC toughness value is measured for elastic-plastic materials.
Now the single-valued JIC is determined as the toughness near the onset of the
ductile crack extension( effect of strain hardening is not important). The test
is performed with multiple specimen loading each of the specimen to various
levels and unloading. This gives the crack mouth opening compliance which is to
be used to get crack length with the help of relationships given in ASTM
standard E 1820, which covers the J-integral testing[22]. Another way of
measuring crack growth is to mark the specimen with heat tinting or fatigue
cracking. The specimen is eventually broken apart and the crack extension is
measured with the help of the marks.
The test thus performed yields several Load vs Crack Mouth Opening Displacement
(CMOD) curve, which are used to calculate J as following:-
   J =  J  e l   +  J  p l     {\displaystyle J=J_{el}+J_{pl}}  [{\displaystyle
J=J_{el}+J_{pl}}]
The linear elastic J is calculated using
    J  e l   =     K  2    (  1 &#x2212;  &#x03BD;  2    )   E
{\displaystyle J_{el}={\frac {K^{2}\left(1-\nu ^{2}\right)}{E}}}  [
{\displaystyle J_{el}={\frac {K^{2}\left(1-\nu ^{2}\right)}{E}}}]and K is
determined from      K  I   =   P  W B  B  N      f ( a  /  W , . . . )
{\displaystyle K_{I}={\frac {P}{\sqrt {WBB_{N}}}}f(a/W,...)}  [{\displaystyle
K_{I}={\frac {P}{\sqrt {WBB_{N}}}}f(a/W,...)}]where BN is the net thickness for
side-grooved specimen and equal to B for not side-grooved specimen
The elastic plastic J is calculated using
    J  p l   =    &#x03B7;  A  p l      B  N    b  o        {\displaystyle J_
{pl}={\frac {\eta A_{pl}}{B_{N}b_{o}}}}  [{\displaystyle J_{pl}={\frac {\eta A_
{pl}}{B_{N}b_{o}}}}]
Where     &#x03B7;   {\displaystyle \eta }  [\eta ]=2 for SENB specimen
bo is initial ligament length given by the difference between width and initial
crack length
APl is the plastic area under the load-displacement curve.
Specialized data reduction technique is used to get a provisional JQ. The value
is accepted if the following criterion is met
   m i n ( B ,  b  o   ) &#x2265;    25  J  Q     &#x03C3;  Y
{\displaystyle min(B,b_{o})\geq {\frac {25J_{Q}}{\sigma _{Y}}}}  [
{\displaystyle min(B,b_{o})\geq {\frac {25J_{Q}}{\sigma _{Y}}}}]

**** Determination of tear resistance (Kahn tear test)[edit] ****
The tear test (e.g. Kahn tear test) provides a semi-quantitative measure of
toughness in terms of tear resistance. This type of test requires a smaller
specimen, and can, therefore, be used for a wider range of product forms. The
tear test can also be used for very ductile aluminium alloys (e.g. 1100, 3003),
where linear elastic fracture mechanics do not apply (see properties in
practice).
**** Fracture toughness of AISI steel[edit] ****
The fracture toughness of AISI 4340 steel has been determined by several
methods, i.e. (i)Jr curve, (ii)Î´r curve, (iii) Kr curve, (iv) stretch zone
size measurements (v) non-linear energy method of Poulose et al. and by (vi) a
new procedure proposed recently by Banerjee. Compact tension specimens with TL
orientation have been used. All the specimens used satisfied the ASTM E813 test
size requirements. Applicability of various fracture toughness estimation
procedures like (i) Hanhn and Rosenfield, (ii) Rolfe and Barsom and (iii)
equivalent energy rate method of Bucci et al. have been examined. These values
have been compared with true fracture toughness of the material obtained by
ASTM E399 test procedure.[23]
Comparison of various conventional test methods indicate multiple specimen
curve method gives most consistent results and these values are within +15% of
the true fracture toughness value. Out of all estimation procedures Rolfe and
Barsom's method appears to be best, giving number within +8% of the true
fracture toughness value. Non-linear energy method was found to give a fracture
toughness value consistent with true fracture toughness of the material.

For two-dimensional problems (plane_stress, plane_strain, antiplane_shear)
involving cracks that move in a straight path, the mode_I stress_intensity
factor      K  I     {\displaystyle K_{I}}  [K_I] is related to the energy
release_rate, also in mode I,      G  I     {\displaystyle G_{I}}  [G_{I}] by
