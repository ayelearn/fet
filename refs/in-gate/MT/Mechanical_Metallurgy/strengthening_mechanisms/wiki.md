Methods have been devised to modify the yield_strength, ductility, and
toughness of both crystalline and amorphous materials. These strengthening
mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of
materials to suit a variety of different applications. For example, the
favorable properties of steel result from interstitial incorporation of carbon
into the iron lattice. Brass, a binary alloy of copper and zinc, has superior
mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution
strengthening. Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on
anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce
dislocations into materials, increasing their yield_strengths.

***** Basic description[edit] *****
Plastic_deformation occurs when large numbers of dislocations move and multiply
so as to result in macroscopic deformation. In other words, it is the movement
of dislocations in the material which allows for deformation. If we want to
enhance a material's mechanical properties (i.e. increase the yield and tensile
strength), we simply need to introduce a mechanism which prohibits the mobility
of these dislocations. Whatever the mechanism may be, (work hardening, grain
size reduction, etc.) they all hinder dislocation motion and render the
material stronger than previously.[1][2][3][4]
The stress required to cause dislocation motion is orders of magnitude lower
than the theoretical stress required to shift an entire plane of atoms, so this
mode of stress relief is energetically favorable. Hence, the hardness and
strength (both yield and tensile) critically depend on the ease with which
dislocations move. Pinning_points, or locations in the crystal that oppose the
motion of dislocations,[5] can be introduced into the lattice to reduce
dislocation mobility, thereby increasing mechanical strength. Dislocations may
be pinned due to stress_field interactions with other dislocations and solute
particles, creating physical barriers from second phase precipitates forming
along grain boundaries. There are four main strengthening mechanisms for
metals, each is a method to prevent dislocation motion and propagation, or make
it energetically unfavorable for the dislocation to move. For a material that
has been strengthened, by some processing method, the amount of force required
to start irreversible (plastic)_deformation is greater than it was for the
original material.
In amorphous materials such as polymers, amorphous ceramics (glass), and
amorphous metals, the lack of long range order leads to yielding via mechanisms
such as brittle fracture, crazing, and shear_band formation. In these systems,
strengthening mechanisms do not involve dislocations, but rather consist of
modifications to the chemical structure and processing of the constituent
material.
The strength of materials cannot infinitely increase. Each of the mechanisms
explained below involves some trade-off by which other material properties are
compromised in the process of strengthening.
***** Strengthening mechanisms in metals[edit] *****
**** Work hardening[edit] ****
Main article: Work_hardening
The primary species responsible for work_hardening are dislocations.
Dislocations interact with each other by generating stress fields in the
material. The interaction between the stress fields of dislocations can impede
dislocation motion by repulsive or attractive interactions. Additionally, if
two dislocations cross, dislocation line entanglement occurs, causing the
formation of a jog which opposes dislocation motion. These entanglements and
jogs act as pinning points, which oppose dislocation motion. As both of these
processes are more likely to occur when more dislocations are present, there is
a correlation between dislocation density and yield strength,
   &#x0394;  &#x03C3;  y   =  G b    &#x03C1;  &#x22A5;        {\displaystyle
\Delta \sigma _{y}={Gb{\sqrt {\rho _{\perp }}}}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta \sigma
_{y}={Gb{\sqrt {\rho _{\perp }}}}}]
where     G   {\displaystyle G}  [G] is the shear_modulus,     b
{\displaystyle b}  [b] is the Burgers_vector, and      &#x03C1;  &#x22A5;
{\displaystyle \rho _{\perp }}  [\rho _{\perp }] is the dislocation density.
Increasing the dislocation density increases the yield strength which results
in a higher shear stress required to move the dislocations. This process is
easily observed while working a material (in metals cold working of process).
Theoretically, the strength of a material with no dislocations will be
extremely high (Ï=G/2) because plastic deformation would require the breaking
of many bonds simultaneously. However, at moderate dislocation density values
of around 107-109 dislocations/m2, the material will exhibit a significantly
lower mechanical strength. Analogously, it is easier to move a rubber rug
across a surface by propagating a small ripple through it than by dragging the
whole rug. At dislocation densities of 1014 dislocations/m2 or higher, the
strength of the material becomes high once again. Also, the dislocation density
cannot be infinitely high, because then the material would lose its crystalline
structure.Citation needed
This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of
interstitial solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atoms
cause. The interstitial solute could be carbon in iron for example. The carbon
atoms in the interstitial sites of the lattice creates a stress field that
impedes dislocation movement.
This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of
substitutional solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atom
causes.
**** Solid solution strengthening and alloying[edit] ****
Main article: Solid_solution_strengthening
For this strengthening mechanism, solute atoms of one element are added to
another, resulting in either substitutional or interstitial point defects in
the crystal (see Figure 1). The solute atoms cause lattice distortions that
impede dislocation motion, increasing the yield_stress of the material. Solute
atoms have stress fields around them which can interact with those of
dislocations. The presence of solute atoms impart compressive or tensile
stresses to the lattice, depending on solute size, which interfere with nearby
dislocations, causing the solute atoms to act as potential barriers.
The shear stress required to move dislocations in a material is:
   &#x0394; &#x03C4; = G b   c    &#x03F5;  3  /  2     {\displaystyle \Delta
\tau =Gb{\sqrt {c}}\epsilon ^{3/2}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta \tau =Gb{\sqrt
{c}}\epsilon ^{3/2}}]
where     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] is the solute concentration and
&#x03F5;   {\displaystyle \epsilon }  [\epsilon ] is the strain on the material
caused by the solute.
Increasing the concentration of the solute atoms will increase the yield
strength of a material, but there is a limit to the amount of solute that can
be added, and one should look at the phase diagram for the material and the
alloy to make sure that a second phase is not created.
In general, the solid solution strengthening depends on the concentration of
the solute atoms, shear modulus of the solute atoms, size of solute atoms,
valency of solute atoms (for ionic materials), and the symmetry of the solute
stress field. The magnitude of strengthening is higher for non-symmetric stress
fields because these solutes can interact with both edge and screw
dislocations, whereas symmetric stress fields, which cause only volume change
and not shape change, can only interact with edge dislocations.
Figure 2: A schematic illustrating how the dislocations can interact with a
particle. It can either cut through the particle or bow around the particle and
create a dislocation loop as it moves over the particle.
**** Precipitation hardening[edit] ****
Main article: Precipitation_strengthening
In most binary systems, alloying above a concentration given by the phase
diagram will cause the formation of a second phase. A second phase can also be
created by mechanical or thermal treatments. The particles that compose the
second phase precipitates act as pinning points in a similar manner to solutes,
though the particles are not necessarily single atoms.
The dislocations in a material can interact with the precipitate atoms in one
of two ways (see Figure 2). If the precipitate atoms are small, the
dislocations would cut through them. As a result, new surfaces (b in Figure 2)
of the particle would get exposed to the matrix and the particle-matrix
interfacial energy would increase. For larger precipitate particles, looping or
bowing of the dislocations would occur and result in dislocations getting
longer. Hence, at a critical radius of about 5 nm, dislocations will preferably
cut across the obstacle, while for a radius of 30 nm, the dislocations will
readily bow or loop to overcome the obstacle.
The mathematical descriptions are as follows:
For particle bowing-     &#x0394; &#x03C4; =    G b   L &#x2212; 2 r
{\displaystyle \Delta \tau ={Gb \over L-2r}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta \tau ={Gb
\over L-2r}}]
For particle cutting-     &#x0394; &#x03C4; =    &#x03B3; &#x03C0; r   b L
{\displaystyle \Delta \tau ={\gamma \pi r \over bL}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
\tau ={\gamma \pi r \over bL}}]
Figure 3: A schematic roughly illustrating the concept of dislocation pile up
and how it effects the strength of the material. A material with larger grain
size is able to have more dislocation to pile up leading to a bigger driving
force for dislocations to move from one grain to another. Thus, less force need
be applied to move a dislocation from a larger, than from a smaller grain,
leading materials with smaller grains to exhibit higher yield stress.
**** Grain boundary strengthening[edit] ****
Main article: Grain_boundary_strengthening
In a polycrystalline metal, grain size has a tremendous influence on the
mechanical properties. Because grains usually have varying crystallographic
orientations, grain boundaries arise. While undergoing deformation, slip motion
will take place. Grain boundaries act as an impediment to dislocation motion
for the following two reasons:
1. Dislocation must change its direction of motion due to the differing
orientation of grains.[4]
2. Discontinuity of slip planes from grain one to grain two.[4]
The stress required to move a dislocation from one grain to another in order to
plastically deform a material depends on the grain size. The average number of
dislocations per grain decreases with average grain size (see Figure 3). A
lower number of dislocations per grain results in a lower dislocation
'pressure' building up at grain boundaries. This makes it more difficult for
dislocations to move into adjacent grains. This relationship is the Hall-Petch
relationship and can be mathematically described as follows:
    &#x03C3;  y   =  &#x03C3;  y , 0   +   k   d  x        {\displaystyle
\sigma _{y}=\sigma _{y,0}+{k \over {d^{x}}}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _
{y}=\sigma _{y,0}+{k \over {d^{x}}}}],
where     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] is a constant,     d   {\displaystyle d}
[d] is the average grain diameter and      &#x03C3;  y , 0     {\displaystyle
\sigma _{y,0}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{y,0}}] is the original yield stress.
The fact that the yield strength increases with decreasing grain size is
accompanied by the caveat that the grain size cannot be decreased infinitely.
As the grain size decreases, more free volume is generated resulting in lattice
mismatch. Below approximately 10 nm, the grain boundaries will tend to slide
instead; a phenomenon known as grain-boundary_sliding. If the grain size gets
too small, it becomes more difficult to fit the dislocations in the grain and
the stress required to move them is less. It was not possible to produce
materials with grain sizes below 10 nm until recently, so the discovery that
strength decreases below a critical grain size is still finding new
applications.
**** Transformation hardening[edit] ****
This method of hardening is used for steels.
High-strength steels generally fall into three basic categories, classified by
the strengthening mechanism employed. 1- solid-solution-strengthened_steels_
(rephos_steels) 2- grain-refined_steels or high_strength_low_alloy_steels_
(HSLA) 3- transformation-hardened steels
Transformation-hardened steels are the third type of high-strength steels.These
steels use predominantly higher levels of C and Mn along with heat treatment to
increase strength. The finished product will have a duplex micro-structure of
ferrite with varying levels of degenerate martensite. This allows for varying
levels of strength. There are three basic types of transformation-hardened
steels. These are dual-phase (DP), transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP),
and martensitic steels.
The annealing process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the
steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region for a set period of time. During
that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater
purity. The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed into
martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to
a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition. By controlling
the amount of martensite in the steel, as well as the degree of temper, the
strength level can be controlled. Depending on processing and chemistry, the
strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa.
TRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain
small amounts of Austen and bainite in a ferrite matrix. Thermal processing for
TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region for a period
of time sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse into austenite. The steel is
then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there.
This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product. While
at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite. This,
in turn, lowers the martensite start temperature to below room temperature.
Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly
ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of
decomposed austenite). This combination of micro-structures has the added
benefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming. This
offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels.
Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger.
Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa.
Martensitic steels are also high in C and Mn. These are fully quenched to
martensite during processing. The martensite structure is then tempered back to
the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel. Tensile
strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.
***** Strengthening mechanisms in amorphous materials[edit] *****
**** Polymer[edit] ****
Polymers fracture via breaking of inter- and intra molecular bonds; hence, the
chemical structure of these materials plays a huge role in increasing strength.
For polymers consisting of chains which easily slide past each other, chemical
and physical cross linking can be used to increase rigidity and yield strength.
In thermoset polymers (thermosetting_plastic), disulfide bridges and other
covalent cross links give rise to a hard structure which can withstand very
high temperatures. These cross-links are particularly helpful in improving
tensile strength of materials which contain lots of free volume prone to
crazing, typically glassy brittle polymers.[6] In thermoplastic_elastomer,
phase separation of dissimilar monomer components leads to association of hard
domains within a sea of soft phase, yielding a physical structure with
increased strength and rigidity. If yielding occurs by chains sliding past each
other (shear bands), the strength can also be increased by introducing kinks
into the polymer chains via unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.[6]
Adding filler_materials such as fibers, platelets, and particles is a commonly
employed technique for strengthening polymer materials. Fillers such as clay,
silica, and carbon network materials have been extensively researched and used
in polymer composites in part due to their effect on mechanical properties.
Stiffness-confinement effects near rigid interfaces, such as those between a
polymer matrix and stiffer filler materials, enhance the stiffness of
composites by restricting polymer chain motion.[7] This is especially present
where fillers are chemically treated to strongly interact with polymer chains,
increasing the anchoring of polymer chains to the filler interfaces and thus
further restricting the motion of chains away from the interface.[8] Stiffness-
confinement effects have been characterized in model nanocomposites, and shows
that composites with length scales on the order of nanometers increase the
effect of the fillers on polymer stiffness dramatically.[9]
Increasing the bulkiness of the monomer unit via incorporation of aryl rings is
another strengthening mechanism. The anisotropy of the molecular structure
means that these mechanisms are heavily dependent on the direction of applied
stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along the direction of
the chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions.
Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this anisotropy. For
example, the high strength of Kevlar arises from a stacked multilayer
macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their
neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with
flexible linkages, such as oriented polyethylene, are highly prone to shear
band formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the
draw direction would increase strength.[6]
Mixing polymers is another method of increasing strength, particularly with
materials that show crazing preceding brittle fracture such as atactic
polystyrene (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of APS with
polyphenylene oxide (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely
suppressed, substantially increasing the fracture strength.[6]
Interpenetrating_polymer_networks (IPNs), consisting of interlacing crosslinked
polymer networks that are not covalently bonded to one another, can lead to
enhanced strength in polymer materials. The use of an IPN approach imposes
compatibility (and thus macroscale homogeneity) on otherwise immiscible blends,
allowing for a blending of mechanical properties. For example, silicone-
polyurethane IPNs show increased tear and flexural strength over base silicone
networks, while preserving the high elastic recovery of the silicone network at
high strains.[10] Increased stiffness can also be achieved by pre-straining
polymer networks and then sequentially forming a secondary network within the
strained material. This takes advantage of the anisotropic strain hardening of
the original network (chain alignment from stretching of the polymer chains)
and provides a mechanism whereby the two networks transfer stress to one
another due to the imposed strain on the pre-strained network.[11]
**** Glass[edit] ****
Many silicate glasses are strong in compression but weak in tension. By
introducing compression stress into the structure, the tensile strength of the
material can be increased. This is typically done via two mechanisms: thermal
treatment (tempering) or chemical bath (via ion exchange).
In tempered glasses, air jets are used to rapidly cool the top and bottom
surfaces of a softened (hot) slab of glass. Since the surface cools quicker,
there is more free volume at the surface than in the bulk melt. The core of the
slab then pulls the surface inward, resulting in an internal compressive stress
at the surface. This substantially increases the tensile strength of the
material as tensile stresses exerted on the glass must now resolve the
compressive stresses before yielding.
    &#x03C3;  y = m o d i f i e d   =  &#x03C3;  y , 0   +  &#x03C3;  c o m p r
e s s i v e     {\displaystyle \sigma _{y=modified}=\sigma _{y,0}+\sigma _
{compressive}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{y=modified}=\sigma _{y,0}+\sigma _
{compressive}}]
Alternately, in chemical treatment, a glass slab treated containing network
formers and modifiers is submerged into a molten salt bath containing ions
larger than those present in the modifier. Due to a concentration gradient of
the ions, mass transport must take place. As the larger cation diffuses from
the molten salt into the surface, it replaces the smaller ion from the
modifier. The larger ion squeezing into surface introduces compressive stress
in the glass's surface. A common example is treatment of sodium oxide modified
silicate glass in molten potassium_chloride.
***** Composite strengthening[edit] *****
Many of the basic strengthening mechanisms can be classified based on their
dimensionality. At 0-D there is precipitate and solid solution strengthening
with particulates strengthening structure, at 1-D there is work/forest
hardening with line dislocations as the hardening mechanism, and at 2-D there
is grain boundary strengthening with surface energy of granular interfaces
providing strength improvement. The two primary types of composite
strengthening, fiber reinforcement and laminar reinforcement, fall in the 1-
D and 2-D classes, respectively. The anisotropy of fiber and laminar composite
strength reflects these dimensionalities. The primary idea behind composite
strengthening is to combine materials with opposite strengths and weaknesses to
create a material which transfers load onto the stiffer material but benefits
from the ductility and toughness of the softer material. [12]
**** Fiber reinforcement[edit] ****
Main article: Fiber-reinforced_composite
Fiber-reinforced composites (FRCs) consist of a matrix of one material
containing parallel embedded fibers. There are two variants of fiber-reinforced
composites, one with stiff fibers and a ductile matrix and one with ductile
fibers and a stiff matrix. The former variant is exemplified by fiberglass
which contains very strong but delicate glass fibers embedded in a softer
plastic matrix resilient to fracture. The latter variant is found in almost all
buildings as reinforced concrete with ductile, high tensile-strength steel rods
embedded in brittle, high compressive-strength concrete. In both cases, the
matrix and fibers have complimentary mechanical properties and the resulting
composite material is therefore more practical for applications in the real
world.
For a composite containing aligned, stiff fibers which span the length of the
material and a soft, ductile matrix, the following descriptions provide a rough
model.
*** Four stages of deformation[edit] ***
The condition of a fiber-reinforced composite under applied tensile stress
along the direction of the fibers can be decomposed into four stages from small
strain to large strain. Since the stress is parallel to the fibers, the
deformation is described by the isostrain condition, i.e., the fiber and matrix
experience the same strain. At each stage, the composite stress (     &#x03C3;
c     {\displaystyle \sigma _{c}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{c}}]) is given in
terms of the volume fractions of the fiber and matrix (     V  f   ,  V  m
{\displaystyle V_{f},V_{m}}  [{\displaystyle V_{f},V_{m}}]), the Young's moduli
of the fiber and matrix (     E  f   ,  E  m     {\displaystyle E_{f},E_{m}}  [
{\displaystyle E_{f},E_{m}}]), the strain of the composite (     &#x03F5;  c
{\displaystyle \epsilon _{c}}  [{\displaystyle \epsilon _{c}}]), and the stress
of the fiber and matrix as read from a stress-strain curve (     &#x03C3;  f
(  &#x03F5;  c   ) ,  &#x03C3;  m   (  &#x03F5;  c   )   {\displaystyle \sigma
_{f}(\epsilon _{c}),\sigma _{m}(\epsilon _{c})}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{f}
(\epsilon _{c}),\sigma _{m}(\epsilon _{c})}]).
   1. Both fiber and composite remain in the elastic strain regime. In this
      stage, we also note that the composite Young's modulus is a simple
      weighted sum of the two component moduli.
                &#x03C3;  c   =  V  f    &#x03F5;  c    E  f   +  V  m
            &#x03F5;  c    E  m     {\displaystyle \sigma _{c}=V_{f}\epsilon _
            {c}E_{f}+V_{m}\epsilon _{c}E_{m}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{c}=V_
            {f}\epsilon _{c}E_{f}+V_{m}\epsilon _{c}E_{m}}] [12]
                E  c   =  V  f    E  f   +  V  m    E  m     {\displaystyle E_
            {c}=V_{f}E_{f}+V_{m}E_{m}}  [{\displaystyle E_{c}=V_{f}E_{f}+V_
            {m}E_{m}}] [12]
   2. The fiber remains in the elastic regime but the matrix yields and
      plastically deforms.
                &#x03C3;  c   =  V  f    &#x03F5;  c    E  f   +  V  m
            &#x03C3;  m   (  &#x03F5;  c   )   {\displaystyle \sigma _{c}=V_
            {f}\epsilon _{c}E_{f}+V_{m}\sigma _{m}(\epsilon _{c})}  [
            {\displaystyle \sigma _{c}=V_{f}\epsilon _{c}E_{f}+V_{m}\sigma _{m}
            (\epsilon _{c})}] [12]
   3. Both fiber and composite yield and plastically deform. This stage often
      features significant Poisson strain which is not captured by model below.
                &#x03C3;  c   =  V  f    &#x03C3;  f   (  &#x03F5;  c   ) +  V
            m    &#x03C3;  m   (  &#x03F5;  c   )   {\displaystyle \sigma _
            {c}=V_{f}\sigma _{f}(\epsilon _{c})+V_{m}\sigma _{m}(\epsilon _
            {c})}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{c}=V_{f}\sigma _{f}(\epsilon _
            {c})+V_{m}\sigma _{m}(\epsilon _{c})}] [12]
   4. The fiber fractures while the matrix continues to plastically deform.
      While in reality the fractured pieces of fiber still contribute some
      strength, it is left out of this simple model.
                &#x03C3;  c   &#x2248;  V  m    &#x03C3;  m   (  &#x03F5;  c
            )   {\displaystyle \sigma _{c}\approx V_{m}\sigma _{m}(\epsilon _
            {c})}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{c}\approx V_{m}\sigma _{m}(\epsilon
            _{c})}][12]
*** Tensile strength[edit] ***
Due to the heterogeneous nature of FRCs, they also feature multiple tensile
strengths (TS), one corresponding to each component. Given the assumptions
outlined above, the first tensile strength would correspond to failure of the
fibers, with some support from the matrix plastic deformation strength, and the
second with failure of the matrix.
         T  S  1   =  V  f   T  S  f   +  V  m    &#x03C3;  m   (  &#x03F5;  c
      )   {\displaystyle TS_{1}=V_{f}TS_{f}+V_{m}\sigma _{m}(\epsilon _{c})}  [
      {\displaystyle TS_{1}=V_{f}TS_{f}+V_{m}\sigma _{m}(\epsilon _{c})}] [12]
         T  S  2   =  V  m   T  S  m     {\displaystyle TS_{2}=V_{m}TS_{m}}  [
      {\displaystyle TS_{2}=V_{m}TS_{m}}] [12]
*** Anisotropy (Orientation effects)[edit] ***
As a result of the aforementioned dimensionality (1-D) of fiber reinforcement,
significant anisotropy is observed in its mechanical properties. The following
equations model the tensile strength of a FRC as a function of the misalignment
angle (    &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle \theta }  [\theta ]) between the fibers
and the applied force, the stresses in the parallel and perpendicular, or
&#x03B8; = 0   {\displaystyle \theta =0}  [\theta =0] and     90
{\displaystyle 90}  [90]o, cases (    &#xA0;  &#x03C3;   |   |    ,  &#x03C3;
&#x22A5;     {\displaystyle \ \sigma _{||},\sigma _{\perp }}  [{\displaystyle \
\sigma _{||},\sigma _{\perp }}]), and the shear strength of the matrix
(     &#x03C4;  m y     {\displaystyle \tau _{my}}  [{\displaystyle \tau _
{my}}]).
        Small Misalignment Angle (longitudinal fracture)
The angle is small enough to maintain load transfer onto the fibers and prevent
delamination of fibers and the misaligned stress samples a slightly larger
cross-sectional area of the fiber so the strength of the fiber is not just
maintained but actually increases compared to the parallel case.
   T S ( &#x03B8; ) =    &#x03C3;   |   |      cos  2   &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; )
{\displaystyle TS(\theta )={\frac {\sigma _{||}}{\cos ^{2}(\theta )}}}  [
{\displaystyle TS(\theta )={\frac {\sigma _{||}}{\cos ^{2}(\theta )}}}] [12]
        Significant Misalignment Angle (shear failure)
The angle is large enough that the load is not effectively transferred to the
fibers and the matrix experiences enough strain to fracture.

        Near Perpendicular Misaligment Angle (transverse fracture)
The angle is close to 90o so most of the load remains in the matrix and thus
tensile transverse matrix fracture is the dominant failure condition. This can
be seen as complementary to the small angle case, with similar form but with an
angle     90 &#x2212; &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle 90-\theta }  [{\displaystyle
90-\theta }].

***** Applications and current research[edit] *****
Strengthening of materials is useful in many applications. A primary
application of strengthened materials is for construction. In order to have
stronger buildings and bridges, one must have a strong frame that can support
high tensile or compressive load and resist plastic deformation. The steel
frame used to make the building should be as strong as possible so that it does
not bend under the entire weight of the building. Polymeric roofing materials
would also need to be strong so that the roof does not cave in when there is
build-up of snow on the rooftop.
Research is also currently being done to increase the strength of metallic
materials through the addition of polymer materials such as bonded carbon fiber
reinforced polymer to (CFRP)[1].
**** Molecular dynamics simulations[edit] ****
The use of computation simulations to model work hardening in materials allows
for the direct observation of critical elements that rule the process of
strengthening materials. The basic reasoning derives from the fact that, when
examining plasticity and the movement of dislocations in materials, a focus on
the atomistic level is many times not accounted for and the focus rests on the
contiuum description of materials. Since the practice of tracking these
atomistic effects in experiments and theorizing about them in textbooks cannot
provide a full understanding of these interactions, many turn to molecular
dynamics simulations to develop this understanding.[13]
The simulations work by utilizing the known atomic interactions between any two
atoms and the relationship F = ma, so that the dislocations moving through the
material are ruled by simple mechanical actions and reactions of the atoms. The
interatomic_potential usually utilized to estimate these interactions is the
Lennard â Jones 12:6 potential. Lennard â Jones is widely accepted because
its experimental shortcomings are well-known.[13][14] These interactions are
simply scaled up to millions or billions of atoms in some cases to simulate
materials more accurately.
Molecular dynamic simulations display the interactions based upon the governing
equations provided above for the strengthening mechanisms. They provide an
effective way to see these mechanisms in action outside the painstaking realm
of direct observation during experiments.
