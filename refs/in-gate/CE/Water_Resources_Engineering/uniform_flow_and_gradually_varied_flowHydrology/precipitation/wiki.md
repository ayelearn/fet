Long-term mean precipitation by month[1]
Countries by average annual precipitation
In meteorology, precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric
water_vapour that falls under gravity.[2] The main forms of precipitation
include drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, graupel and hail. Precipitation occurs when
a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor, so that the
water condenses and "precipitates". Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation
but suspensions, because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to
precipitate. Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming
saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. Precipitation
forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice
crystals within a cloud. Short, intense periods of rain in scattered locations
are called "showers."[3]
Moisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-
freezing air at the surface may be condensed into clouds and rain. This process
is typically active when freezing rain occurs. A stationary_front is often
present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the focus for forcing and
rising air. Provided necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content, the
moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds, namely stratus and
cumulonimbus. Eventually, the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form
raindrops and descend toward the Earth where they will freeze on contact with
exposed objects. Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example
due to water evaporation from lakes, lake-effect_snowfall becomes a concern
downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of
extratropical_cyclones. Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy. Thundersnow
is possible within a cyclone's comma_head and within lake effect precipitation
bands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow
is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation. On the leeward
side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by
compressional heating. Most precipitation occurs within the tropics[4] and is
caused by convection. The movement of the monsoon_trough, or intertropical
convergence_zone, brings rainy_seasons to savannah climes.
Precipitation is a major component of the water_cycle, and is responsible for
depositing the fresh_water on the planet. Approximately 505,000 cubic
kilometres (121,000 cu mi) of water falls as precipitation each year; 398,000
cubic kilometres (95,000 cu mi) of it over the oceans and 107,000 cubic
kilometres (26,000 cu mi) over land.[5] Given the Earth's surface area, that
means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres (39 in),
but over land it is only 715 millimetres (28.1 in). Climate classification
systems such as the KÃ¶ppen_climate_classification system use average annual
rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
Precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies, e.g. when it gets cold, Mars
has precipitation which most likely takes the form of frost, rather than rain
or snow.[6]

***** Types[edit] *****
Main article: Precipitation_types
A thunderstorm with heavy precipitation
Precipitation is a major component of the water_cycle, and is responsible for
depositing most of the fresh_water on the planet. Approximately 505,000 km3
(121,000 mi3) of water falls as precipitation each year, 398,000 km3
(95,000 cu mi) of it over the oceans.[5] Given the Earth's surface area, that
means the globally averaged annual precipitation is 990 millimetres (39 in).
Mechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform,[7] and
orographic rainfall.[8] Convective processes involve strong vertical motions
that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an
hour and cause heavy precipitation,[9] while stratiform processes involve
weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation.[10] Precipitation can be
divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water,
liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice. Mixtures of
different types of precipitation, including types in different categories, can
fall simultaneously. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle.
Rain or drizzle that freezes on contact within a subfreezing air_mass is called
"freezing rain" or "freezing drizzle". Frozen forms of precipitation include
snow, ice_needles, ice_pellets, hail, and graupel.[11]
***** How the air becomes saturated[edit] *****
**** Cooling air to its dew point[edit] ****
Late-summer rainstorm in Denmark
Lenticular cloud forming due to mountains over Wyoming
The dew_point is the temperature to which a parcel of air must be cooled in
order to become saturated, and (unless super-saturation occurs) condenses to
water.[12] Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation_nuclei such
as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. An elevated portion of a
frontal zone forces broad areas of lift, which form clouds decks such as
altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form
when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also
form due to the lifting of advection_fog during breezy conditions.[13]
There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic
cooling, conductive cooling, radiational_cooling, and evaporative cooling.
Adiabatic_cooling occurs when air rises and expands.[14] The air can rise due
to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a
mountain (orographic_lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into
contact with a colder surface,[15] usually by being blown from one surface to
another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational
cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared_radiation, either by the air or
by the surface underneath.[16] Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is
added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool
to its wet-bulb_temperature, or until it reaches saturation.[17]
**** Adding moisture to the air[edit] ****
The main ways water vapor is added to the air are: wind convergence into areas
of upward motion,[9] precipitation or virga falling from above,[18] daytime
heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land,
[19] transpiration from plants,[20] cool or dry air moving over warmer water,
[21] and lifting air over mountains.[22]
***** Formation[edit] *****
Main article: Water_cycle
Condensation and coalescence are important parts of the water_cycle.
**** Raindrops[edit] ****
Coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets, or
when water droplets freeze onto an ice crystal, which is known as the Bergeron
process. The fall rate of very small droplets is negligible, hence clouds do
not fall out of the sky; precipitati ((clouds)) on will only occur when these
coalesce into larger drops. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide,
producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence
continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and
fall as rain.[23]
Raindrops have sizes ranging from 0.1 millimetres (0.0039 in) to 9 millimetres
(0.35 in) mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are
called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in
size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the
oncoming airflow. Contrary to the cartoon pictures of raindrops, their shape
does not resemble a teardrop.[24] Intensity and duration of rainfall are
usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of
short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.[25][26] Rain
drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops.[27]
The METAR code for rain is RA, while the coding for rain showers is SHRA.[28]
**** Ice pellets[edit] ****
Main article: Ice_pellets
An accumulation of ice pellets
Ice_pellets or sleet are a form of precipitation consisting of small,
translucent balls of ice. Ice pellets are usually (but not always) smaller than
hailstones.[29] They often bounce when they hit the ground, and generally do
not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing_rain. The METAR code
for ice pellets is PL.[28]
Ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air exists with sub-freezing
air both above and below. This causes the partial or complete melting of any
snowflakes falling through the warm layer. As they fall back into the sub-
freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets. However,
if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the
precipitation will not have time to re-freeze, and freezing_rain will be the
result at the surface. A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the
ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm_front during the cold
season,[30] but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold_front.
**** Hail[edit] ****
Main article: Hail
A large hailstone, about 6 centimetres (2.4 in) in diameter
Like other precipitation, hail forms in storm clouds when supercooled water
droplets freeze on contact with condensation_nuclei, such as dust or dirt. The
storm's updraft blows the hailstones to the upper part of the cloud. The
updraft dissipates and the hailstones fall down, back into the updraft, and are
lifted again. Hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres (0.20 in) or more.[31]
Within METAR code, GR is used to indicate larger hail, of a diameter of at
least 6.4 millimetres (0.25 in). GR is derived from the French word grÃªle.
Smaller-sized hail, as well as snow pellets, use the coding of GS, which is
short for the French word grÃ©sil.[28] Stones just larger than golf_ball-sized
are one of the most frequently reported hail sizes.[32] Hailstones can grow to
15 centimetres (6 in) and weigh more than 500 grams (1 lb).[33] In large
hailstones, latent_heat released by further freezing may melt the outer shell
of the hailstone. The hailstone then may undergo 'wet growth', where the liquid
outer shell collects other smaller hailstones.[34] The hailstone gains an ice
layer and grows increasingly larger with each ascent. Once a hailstone becomes
too heavy to be supported by the storm's updraft, it falls from the cloud.[35]
**** Snowflakes[edit] ****
Main article: Snowflake
Snowflake viewed in an optical microscope
Snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets (about 10 Î¼m in
diameter) freeze. Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated
environment. Because water droplets are more numerous than the ice crystals the
crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers in size at the expense of
the water droplets. This process is known as the WegenerâBergeronâFindeisen
process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to
evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These
large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall
through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in
clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the
type of ice particle that falls to the ground.[36] Guinness World Records list
the world's largest snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana;
allegedly one measured 38 cm (15 inches) wide.[37] The exact details of the
sticking mechanism remain a subject of research.
Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and
hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to
diffuse_reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.
[38] The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and
humidity at which it is formed.[36] Rarely, at a temperature of around â2 Â°C
(28 Â°F), snowflakes can form in threefold symmetryâtriangular snowflakes.
[39] The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near-
perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more
visually appealing. No two snowflakes are alike,[40] as they grow at different
rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and
humidity within the atmosphere through which they fall on their way to the
ground.[41] The METAR code for snow is SN, while snow showers are coded SHSN.
[28]
**** Diamond dust[edit] ****
Main article: Diamond_dust
Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures
approaching â40 Â°C (â40 Â°F) due to air with slightly higher moisture from
aloft mixing with colder, surface based air.[42] They are made of simple ice
crystals that are hexagonal in shape.[43] The METAR identifier for diamond dust
within international hourly weather reports is IC.[28]
***** Causes[edit] *****
**** Frontal activity[edit] ****
Main article: Weather_fronts
Stratiform or dynamic precipitation occurs as a consequence of slow ascent of
air in synoptic_systems (on the order of cm/s), such as over surface cold
fronts, and over and ahead of warm_fronts. Similar ascent is seen around
tropical_cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation
patterns around mid-latitude_cyclones.[44] A wide variety of weather can be
found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their
passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually
form around mature low-pressure areas.[45] Precipitation may occur on celestial
bodies other than Earth. When it gets cold, Mars has precipitation that most
likely takes the form of ice needles, rather than rain or snow.[6]
**** Convection[edit] ****
Convective precipitation
Convective_rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g.,
cumulonimbus or cumulus_congestus. It falls as showers with rapidly changing
intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively
short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most
precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, it has been
suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.[26][44] Graupel and hail
indicate convection.[46] In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is
intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold
fronts, squall_lines, and warm fronts.[47]
**** Orographic effects[edit] ****
See also: Orographic_lift and Precipitation_types
Orographic precipitation
Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused
by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain
ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of
the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade
winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a
mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by
orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic_wind) on the descending and
generally warming, leeward side where a rain_shadow is observed.[22]
In Hawaii, Mount_WaiÊ»aleÊ»ale, on the island of Kauai, is notable for its
extreme rainfall, as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on
Earth, with 12,000 millimetres (460 in).[48] Storm systems affect the state
with heavy rains between October and March. Local climates vary considerably on
each island due to their topography, divisible into windward (Ko&#x2bb;olau)
and leeward (Kona) regions based upon location relative to the higher
mountains. Windward sides face the east to northeast trade_winds and receive
much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and
less cloud cover.[49]
In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives
in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across
western Argentina.[50] The Sierra_Nevada range creates the same effect in North
America forming the Great_Basin and Mojave_Deserts.[51][52] Similarly, in Asia,
the Himalaya_mountains create an obstacle to monsoons which leads to extremely
high precipitation on the southern side and lower precipitation levels on the
northern side.
**** Snow[edit] ****
Main article: Snow
Lake-effect snow bands near the Korean_Peninsula in early-December 2008.
Extratropical_cyclones can bring cold and dangerous conditions with heavy rain
and snow with winds exceeding 119 km/h (74 mph),[53] (sometimes referred to as
windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation that is associated with their
warm_front is often extensive, forced by weak upward vertical motion of air
over the frontal boundary which condenses as it cools and produces
precipitation within an elongated band,[54] which is wide and stratiform,
meaning falling out of nimbostratus clouds.[55] When moist air tries to
dislodge an arctic air mass, overrunning snow can result within the poleward
side of the elongated precipitation_band. In the Northern_Hemisphere, poleward
is towards the North_Pole, or north. Within the Southern_Hemisphere, poleward
is towards the South_Pole, or south.
Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air
across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect_snow
bands. Those bands bring strong localized snowfall which can be understood as
follows: Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results
in significant temperature differences (larger than 13 Â°C or 23 Â°F) between
the water surface and the air above.[56] Because of this temperature
difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into
vertically oriented clouds (see satellite picture) which produce snow showers.
The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by
both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the
temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater
the precipitation rate becomes.[57]
In mountainous areas, heavy snowfall accumulates when air is forced to ascend
the mountains and squeeze out precipitation along their windward slopes, which
in cold conditions, falls in the form of snow. Because of the ruggedness of
terrain, forecasting the location of heavy snowfall remains a significant
challenge.[58]
**** Within the tropics[edit] ****
Main article: Wet_season
See also: Monsoon and Tropical_cyclone
Rainfall distribution by month in Cairns showing the extent of the wet season
at that location
The wet, or rainy, season is the time of year, covering one or more months,
when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls.[59] The term green
season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities.[60] Areas
with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.
[61] Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry
winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since
their rainfall is equally distributed through the year.[62] Some areas with
pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the
intertropical_convergence_zone or monsoon_trough move poleward of their
location during the middle of the warm season.[25] When the wet season occurs
during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon
and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air_quality improves,
[63] freshwater quality improves,[64][65] and vegetation grows significantly.
Soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases.[25] Animals have adaptation and
survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to
food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing
countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations
due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the
wet season.[66]
Tropical cyclones, a source of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses
several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds
blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction (southern
hemisphere) or counterclockwise (northern hemisphere).[67] Although cyclones
can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important
factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring
much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.[68] Areas in their path can
receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.[69]
**** Large-scale geographical distribution[edit] ****
See also: Earth_rainfall_climatology
On the large scale, the highest precipitation amounts outside topography fall
in the tropics, closely tied to the Intertropical_Convergence_Zone, itself the
ascending branch of the Hadley_cell. Mountainous locales near the equator in
Colombia are amongst the wettest places on Earth.[70] North and south of this
are regions of descending air that form subtropical_ridges where precipitation
is low;[71] the land surface underneath these ridges is usually arid, and these
regions make up most of the Earth's deserts.[72] An exception to this rule is
in Hawaii, where upslope flow due to the trade_winds lead to one of the wettest
locations on Earth.[73] Otherwise, the flow of the Westerlies into the Rocky
Mountains lead to the wettest, and at elevation snowiest,[74] locations within
North_America. In Asia during the wet season, the flow of moist air into the
Himalayas leads to some of the greatest rainfall amounts measured on Earth in
northeast India.
***** Measurement[edit] *****
See also: Rain_gauge, Disdrometer, and Snow_gauge
Standard rain gauge
The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge,
which can be found in 100 mm (4 in) plastic and 200 mm (8 in) metal varieties.
[75] The inner cylinder is filled by 25 mm (1 in) of rain, with overflow
flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner
cylinder down to 0.25 mm (0.01 in) resolution, while metal gauges require use
of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25 mm (0.01 in) markings. After the
inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with
the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer
cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is
empty. These gauges are used in the winter by removing the funnel and inner
cylinder and allowing snow and freezing rain to collect inside the outer
cylinder. Some add anti-freeze to their gauge so they do not have to melt the
snow or ice that falls into the gauge.[76] Once the snowfall/ice is finished
accumulating, or as 300 mm (12 in) is approached, one can either bring it
inside to melt, or use lukewarm water to fill the inner cylinder with in order
to melt the frozen precipitation in the outer cylinder, keeping track of the
warm fluid added, which is subsequently subtracted from the overall total once
all the ice/snow is melted.[77]
Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge
and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.
[78] The wedge and tipping bucket gauges will have problems with snow. Attempts
to compensate for snow/ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited
success, since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above freezing.
Weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow, but again, the funnel
needs to be removed before the event begins. For those looking to measure
rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides
will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend
on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges
can be made at home, with enough know-how.[79]
When a precipitation measurement is made, various networks exist across the
United_States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted
through the Internet, such as CoCoRAHS or GLOBE.[80][81] If a network is not
available in the area where one lives, the nearest local weather office will
likely be interested in the measurement.[82]
**** Hydrometeor definition[edit] ****
A concept used in precipitation measurement is the hydrometeor. Any
particulates of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as
hydrometeors. Formations due to condensation, such as clouds, haze, fog, and
mist, are composed of hydrometeors. All precipitation types are made up of
hydrometeors by definition, including virga, which is precipitation which
evaporates before reaching the ground. Particles blown from the Earth's surface
by wind, such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray, are also hydrometeors, as
are hail and snow.[83]
**** Satellite estimates[edit] ****
Although surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring
precipitation, there are many areas in which their use is not feasible. This
includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas. In other cases,
social, technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge
observations. As a result, the modern global record of precipitation largely
depends on satellite observations.[84]
Satellite sensors work by remotely sensing precipitationârecording various
parts of the electromagnetic_spectrum that theory and practice show are related
to the occurrence and intensity of precipitation. The sensors are almost
exclusively passive, recording what they see, similar to a camera, in contrast
to active sensors (radar, lidar) that send out a signal and detect its impact
on the area being observed.
Satellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two
categories. Thermal infrared (IR) sensors record a channel around 11 micron
wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops. Due to the typical
structure of the atmosphere, cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely
related to cloud-top heights, meaning colder clouds almost always occur at
higher altitudes. Further, cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are
likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds. Various mathematical
schemes, or algorithms, use these and other properties to estimate
precipitation from the IR data.[85]
The second category of sensor channels is in the microwave part of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies in use range from about 10 gigahertz
to a few hundred GHz. Channels up to about 37 GHz primarily provide information
on the liquid hydrometeors (rain and drizzle) in the lower parts of clouds,
with larger amounts of liquid emitting higher amounts of microwave radiant
energy. Channels above 37 GHz display emission signals, but are dominated by
the action of solid hydrometeors (snow, graupel, etc.) to scatter microwave
radiant energy. Satellites such as the Tropical_Rainfall_Measuring_Mission
(TRMM) and the Global_Precipitation_Measurement (GPM) mission employ microwave
sensors to form precipitation estimates.
Additional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide
additional useful information including visible channels, additional IR
channels, water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals. However,
most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources.
[86]
**** Satellite data sets[edit] ****
The IR estimates have rather low skill at short time and space scales, but are
available very frequently (15 minutes or more often) from satellites in
geosynchronous Earth orbit. IR works best in cases of deep, vigorous
convectionâsuch as the tropicsâand becomes progressively less useful in
areas where stratiform (layered) precipitation dominates, especially in mid-
and high-latitude regions. The more-direct physical connection between
hydrometeors and microwave channels gives the microwave estimates greater skill
on short time and space scales than is true for IR. However, microwave sensors
fly only on low Earth orbit satellites, and there are few enough of them that
the average time between observations exceeds three hours. This several-hour
interval is insufficient to adequately document precipitation because of the
transient nature of most precipitation systems as well as the inability of a
single satellite to appropriately capture the typical daily cycle of
precipitation at a given location.
Since the late 1990s, several algorithms have been developed to combine
precipitation data from multiple satellites' sensors, seeking to emphasize the
strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets. The
goal is to provide "best" estimates of precipitation on a uniform time/space
grid, usually for as much of the globe as possible. In some cases the long-term
homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized, which is the Climate_Data_Record
standard.
In other cases, the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite
estimate, which is the High Resolution Precipitation Product approach. In
either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable.
One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small
amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are
endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that
1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of
gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the
necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control. Thus,
precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further
after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates. As a result, while
estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the
"true" precipitation, they are generally not suited for real- or near-real-time
applications.
The work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different
formats, time/space grids, periods of record and regions of coverage, input
datasets, and analysis procedures, as well as many different forms of dataset
version designators.[87] In many cases, one of the modern multi-satellite data
sets is the best choice for general use.
***** Return period[edit] *****
See also: 100-year_flood
The likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and
duration, is called the return_period or frequency.[88] The intensity of a
storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts
based on historic data for the location.[89] The term 1 in 10 year storm
describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every
10 years, so it has a 10 percent likelihood any given year. The rainfall will
be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any
single year. The term 1 in 100 year storm describes a rainfall event which is
extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a
century, so has a 1 percent likelihood in any given year. The rainfall will be
extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10 year event. As with all
probability events, it is possible though unlikely to have two "1 in 100 Year
Storms" in a single year.[90]
***** Uneven pattern of precipitation[edit] *****
A significant portion of the annual precipitation in any particular place falls
on only a few days, typically about 50% during the 12 days with the most
precipitation.[91]
***** Role in KÃ¶ppen climate classification[edit] *****

The KÃ¶ppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and
precipitation. The most commonly used form of the KÃ¶ppen classification has
five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A,
tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The
five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary
classifications such as rain_forest, monsoon, tropical_savanna, humid
subtropical, humid_continental, oceanic_climate, Mediterranean_climate, steppe,
subarctic_climate, tundra, polar_ice_cap, and desert.
Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting
minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 and 2,000 mm (69 and 79 in).[93] A
tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid
climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes, with rainfall between
750 and 1,270 mm (30 and 50 in) a year. They are widespread on Africa, and are
also found in India, the northern parts of South America, Malaysia, and
Australia.[94] The humid subtropical climate zone is where winter rainfall (and
sometimes snowfall) is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer
from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from
occasional tropical_cyclones.[95] Humid subtropical climates lie on the east
side continents, roughly between latitudes 20Â° and 40Â° degrees away from the
equator.[96]
An oceanic (or maritime) climate is typically found along the west coasts at
the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as
well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation
year-round.[97] The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the
lands in the Mediterranean_Basin, parts of western North America, parts of
Western and South_Australia, in southwestern South_Africa and in parts of
central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet
winters.[98] A steppe is a dry grassland.[99] Subarctic climates are cold with
continuous permafrost and little precipitation.[100]
***** Effect on agriculture[edit] *****
Rainfall estimates for southern Japan and the surrounding region from July 20
to 27, 2009.
Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on agriculture. All
plants need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most
effective means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain
pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too much or too little rainfall can
be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase
erosion,[101] while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth.[102]
Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti
require small amounts of water,[103] while tropical plants may need up to
hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.
In areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion
increases during the wet season.[25] Animals have adaptation and survival
strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food
shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.[104] Developing
countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations
due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the
wet season.[66]
***** Changes due to global warming[edit] *****
See also: Global_warming
Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which leads to more
precipitation. Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30Â°N
from 1900 to 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally
there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over
the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time.
Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and
central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa
and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been an increase in the
number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century,
as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of
droughtsâespecially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation
and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid-
and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased
salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation, more evaporation, or
both). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased
at an average rate of 6.1% per century since 1900, with the greatest increases
within the East North Central climate region (11.6% per century) and the South
(11.1%). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (â9.25%).[105]
***** Changes due to urban heat island[edit] *****
See also: Urban_heat_island
Image of Atlanta,_Georgia, showing temperature distribution, with hot areas
appearing white
The urban heat island warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 Â°C (1.1 to 10.1 Â°F) above
surrounding suburbs and rural areas. This extra heat leads to greater upward
motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. Rainfall
rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%. Partly as a result
of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between 32 to 64
kilometres (20 to 40 mi) downwind of cities, compared with upwind.[106] Some
cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.[107]
***** Forecasting[edit] *****
Main articles: Probability_of_precipitation and Quantitative_precipitation
forecast
Example of a five-day rainfall forecast from the Hydrometeorological_Prediction
Center
The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected
amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a
specified area.[108] A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation
type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid
period. Precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as
0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of
topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from
observations with fine detail.[109] Starting in the mid to late 1990s, QPFs
were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers
throughout the United States.[110] Forecast_models show significant sensitivity
to humidity levels within the planetary_boundary_layer, or in the lowest levels
of the atmosphere, which decreases with height.[111] QPF can be generated on a
quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the
probability_of_a_specific_amount, basis.[112] Radar imagery forecasting
techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within six to seven hours of
the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain
gauge measurements, weather_radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various
skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.
