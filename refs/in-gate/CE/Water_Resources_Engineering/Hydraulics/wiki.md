Hydraulics and other studies[1]
An open channel, with a uniform depth. Open-channel hydraulics deals with
uniform and non-uniform streams.

Hydraulics (from Greek: Î¥Î´ÏÎ±ÏÎ»Î¹ÎºÎ®) is a technology and applied_science
using engineering, chemistry, and other sciences involving the mechanical
properties and use of liquids. At a very basic level, hydraulics is the liquid
counterpart of pneumatics, which concerns gases. Fluid_mechanics provides the
theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the applied engineering
using the properties of fluids. In its fluid_power applications, hydraulics is
used for the generation, control, and transmission of power by the use of
pressurized liquids. Hydraulic topics range through some parts of science and
most of engineering modules, and cover concepts such as pipe flow, dam design,
fluidics and fluid control circuitry. The principles of hydraulics are in use
naturally in the human body within the vascular system and erectile tissue.[3]
[4] Free surface hydraulics is the branch of hydraulics dealing with free
surface flow, such as occurring in rivers, canals, lakes, estuaries and seas.
Its sub-field open-channel_flow studies the flow in open channels.
The word "hydraulics" originates from the Greek word á½Î´ÏÎ±ÏÎ»Î¹ÎºÏÏ
(hydraulikos) which in turn originates from á½Î´ÏÏ (hydor, Greek for water)
and Î±á½Î»ÏÏ (aulos, meaning pipe).

***** Ancient and medieval era[edit] *****
Waterwheel.
Early uses of water power date back to Mesopotamia and ancient_Egypt, where
irrigation has been used since the 6th millennium BC and water_clocks had been
used since the early 2nd millennium BC. Other early examples of water power
include the Qanat system in ancient Persia and the Turpan_water_system in
ancient Central Asia.
**** Greek / Hellenistic age[edit] ****
The Greeks constructed sophisticated water and hydraulic power systems. An
example is the construction by Eupalinos, under a public contract, of a
watering channel for Samos, the Tunnel_of_Eupalinos. An early example of the
usage of hydraulic wheel, probably the earliest in Europe, is the Perachora
wheel (3rd century BC).[5]
The construction of the first hydraulic automata by Ctesibius (flourished c.
270 BC) and Hero_of_Alexandria (c. 10 â 80 AD) is notable. Hero describes a
number of working machines using hydraulic power, such as the force_pump, which
is known from many Roman sites as having been used for raising water and in
fire engines.[6]
**** Ancient Persia[edit] ****
The Persians constructed an intricate system of water mills, canals and dams
known as the Shushtar_Historical_Hydraulic_System. The project, commenced by
Achaemenid king Darius_the_Great and finished by a group of Roman engineers
captured by Sassanian king Shapur_I [7], has been referred to by UNESCO as "a
masterpiece of creative genius."[7] They were also the inventors[8] of the
Qanat, an underground aqueduct. Several of Iran's large, ancient gardens were
irrigated thanks to Qanats[9].
**** China[edit] ****
In ancient_China there was Sunshu_Ao (6th century BC), Ximen_Bao (5th century
BC), Du_Shi (circa 31 AD), Zhang_Heng (78 â 139 AD), and Ma_Jun (200 â 265
AD), while medieval China had Su_Song (1020 â 1101 AD) and Shen_Kuo
(1031â1095). Du Shi employed a waterwheel to power the bellows of a blast
furnace producing cast_iron. Zhang Heng was the first to employ hydraulics to
provide motive power in rotating an armillary_sphere for astronomical
observation.[10][citation_needed]
**** Sri Lanka[edit] ****
Moat and gardens at Sigiriya.
In ancient Sri_Lanka, hydraulics were widely used in the ancient kingdoms of
Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.[11] The discovery of the principle of the valve
tower, or valve pit, (Bisokotuwa in Sinhalese) for regulating the escape of
water is credited to ingenuity more than 2,000 years ago.[12] By the first
century AD, several large-scale irrigation works had been completed.[13] Macro-
and micro-hydraulics to provide for domestic horticultural and agricultural
needs, surface drainage and erosion control, ornamental and recreational water
courses and retaining structures and also cooling systems were in place in
Sigiriya, Sri_Lanka. The coral on the massive rock at the site includes
cisterns for collecting water. Large ancient reservoirs of Sri Lanka are
Kalawewa (King Dhatusena), Parakrama Samudra (King Parakrama Bahu), Tisa Wewa
(King Dutugamunu), Minneriya (King Mahasen)
**** Innovations in Ancient Rome[edit] ****
Aqueduct_of_Segovia, a 1st-century AD masterpiece.
In Ancient_Rome, many different hydraulic applications were developed,
including public water supplies, innumerable aqueducts, power using watermills
and hydraulic_mining. They were among the first to make use of the siphon to
carry water across valleys, and used hushing on a large scale to prospect for
and then extract metal ores. They used lead widely in plumbing systems for
domestic and public supply, such as feeding thermae.[citation_needed]
Hydraulic_mining was used in the gold-fields of northern Spain, which was
conquered by Augustus in 25 BC. The alluvial gold-mine of Las_Medulas was one
of the largest of their mines. It was worked by at least 7 long aqueducts, and
the water streams were used to erode the soft deposits, and then wash the
tailings for the valuable gold content.[14][15]
***** Modern era (c. 1600 â 1870)[edit] *****
**** Benedetto Castelli[edit] ****
In 1619 Benedetto_Castelli (1576 â 1578â1643), a student of Galileo
Galilei, published the book Della Misura dell'Acque Correnti or "On the
Measurement of Running Waters", one of the foundations of modern hydrodynamics.
He served as a chief consultant to the Pope on hydraulic projects, i.e.,
management of rivers in the Papal States, beginning in 1626.[16]
**** Blaise Pascal[edit] ****
Blaise_Pascal (1623â1662) studied fluid hydrodynamics and hydrostatics,
centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His discovery on the theory
behind hydraulics led to the invention of the hydraulic_press by Joseph Bramah,
which multiplied a smaller force acting on a smaller area into the application
of a larger force totaled over a larger area, transmitted through the same
pressure (or same change of pressure) at both locations. Pascal's_law or
principle states that for an incompressible fluid at rest, the difference in
pressure is proportional to the difference in height and this difference
remains the same whether or not the overall pressure of the fluid is changed by
applying an external force. This implies that by increasing the pressure at any
point in a confined fluid, there is an equal increase at every other point in
the container, i.e., any change in pressure applied at any point of the fluid
is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluids.
**** Jean LÃ©onard Marie Poiseuille[edit] ****
A French physician, Poiseuille (1797â1869) researched the flow of blood
through the body and discovered an important law governing the rate of flow
with the diameter of the tube in which flow occurred.[17][citation_needed]
**** In the UK[edit] ****
Several cities developed citywide hydraulic_power_networks in the 19th century,
to operate machinery such as lifts, cranes, capstans and the like. Joseph
Bramah[18] (1748â1814) was an early innovator and William_Armstrong[19]
(1810â1900) perfected the apparatus for power delivery on an industrial
scale. In London, the London_Hydraulic_Power_Company[20] was a major supplier
its pipes serving large parts of the West_End_of_London, City and the Docks,
but there were schemes restricted to single enterprises such as docks and
railway goods_yards.
**** Hydraulic models[edit] ****
After students understand the basic principles of hydraulics, some teachers use
a hydraulic analogy to help students learn other things. For example:
    * The MONIAC_Computer uses water flowing through hydraulic components to
      help students learn about economics.
    * The thermal-hydraulic_analogy uses hydraulic principles to help students
      learn about thermal circuits.
    * The electronicâhydraulic_analogy uses hydraulic principles to help
      students learn about electronics.
The conservation_of_mass requirement combined with fluid compressibility yields
a fundamental relationship between pressure, fluid flow, and volumetric
expansion, as shown below [21]:
            d p   d t    =   &#x03B2; V   &#x22C5;  (   &#x2211;  I N   Q
      &#x2212;    d V   d t     )    {\displaystyle {\frac {dp}{dt}}={\frac
      {\beta }{V}}\cdot \left(\sum _{IN}Q-{\frac {dV}{dt}}\right)}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {dp}{dt}}={\frac {\beta }{V}}\cdot \left(\sum _
      {IN}Q-{\frac {dV}{dt}}\right)}]
Assuming an incompressible fluid or a "very large" ratio of compressibility to
contained fluid volume, a finite rate of pressure rise requires that any net
flow into the contained fluid volume create a volumetric change.
