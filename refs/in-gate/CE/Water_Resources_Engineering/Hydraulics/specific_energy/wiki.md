Specific energy
SI unit         J/kg
In SI base_unitsm2/s2
Derivations from e = E/m
other quantities
            Energy_density has tables of specific energies of devices and
            materials.
Specific energy is energy per unit mass. (It is also sometimes called "energy
density," though "energy density" more precisely means energy_per_unit_volume.)
It is used to quantify, for example, stored heat and other thermodynamic
properties of substances such as specific_internal_energy, specific_enthalpy,
specific Gibbs_free_energy, and specific Helmholtz_free_energy. It may also be
used for the kinetic_energy or potential_energy of a body. Specific energy is
an intensive_property, whereas energy and mass are extensive_properties.
The SI unit for specific energy is the joule per kilogram (J/kg). Other units
still in use in some contexts are the kilocalorie per gram (Cal/g or kcal/g),
mostly in food-related topics, watt_hours per kilogram in the field of
batteries, and the Imperial_unit BTU per pound (BTU/lb), in some engineering
and applied technical fields.[1]
The concept of specific energy is related to but distinct from the chemical
notion of molar energy, that is energy per mole of a substance, which uses
units of energy per mole, such as J/mol, kJ/mol, or the older (but still widely
used) kcal/mol.[2]

***** Table of some non-SI conversions[edit] *****
The following table shows the factors for conversion to J/kg of some non-SI
units. :
Unit      SI equivalent
kcal/g[3] 4.184 MJ/kg
Wh/kg     3.6 kJ/kg
kWh/kg    3.6 MJ/kg
Btu/lb[4] 2.326 kJ/kg
Btu/lb[5] ca. 2.32444 kJ/kg

For a table giving the specific energy of many different fuels as well as
batteries, see the article Energy_density.
***** Ionising radiation[edit] *****
For ionising_radiation, the gray is the SI unit of specific energy absorbed by
matter known as absorbed_dose, from which the SI unit the sievert is calculated
for the stochastic health effect on tissues, known as dose_equivalent. The
International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures states: "In order to avoid any
risk of confusion between the absorbed dose D and the dose_equivalent H, the
special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray
should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose D
and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose
equivalent H."[6]
***** Energy density of food[edit] *****
Main article: Food_energy
Energy density is the amount of energy per mass or volume of food. The energy
density of a food can be determined from the label by dividing the energy per
serving (usually in kilojoules or food_calories) by the serving size (usually
in grams, milliliters or fluid ounces). Energy density is thus expressed in
cal/g, kcal/g, J/g, kJ/g, cal/mL, kcal/mL, J/mL, or kJ/mL. The "calorie"
commonly used in nutritional contexts is the kilocalorie (abbreviated "Cal" and
sometimes called the "dietary calorie", "food calorie" or "Calorie" with a
capital "C"). This is equivalent to a thousand calories (abbreviated "cal") or
one kilocalorie (kcal). Because food energy is commonly measured in Calories,
the energy density of food is commonly called "caloric density".[7]
Energy density measures the energy released when the food is metabolized by a
healthy organism when it ingests the food (see food_energy for calculation) and
the food is metabolized with oxygen, into waste products such as carbon_dioxide
and water. Besides alcohol the only sources of food energy are carbohydrates,
fats and proteins, which make up ninety percent of the dry weight of food.[8]
Therefore, water content is the most important factor in energy density.
Carbohydrates provide four calories per gram (17 kJ/g), and proteins offer
slightly less at 16kJ/g whereas fat provides nine calories per gram (38 kJ/g),
[8] &#x200b;2 1⁄4 times as much energy. Fats contain more carbon-carbon and
carbon-hydrogen bonds than carbohydrates or proteins and are therefore richer
in energy.[9] Foods that derive most of their energy from fat have a much
higher energy density than those that derive most of their energy from
carbohydrates or proteins, even if the water content is the same. Nutrients
with a lower absorption, such as fiber or sugar_alcohols, lower the energy
density of foods as well. A moderate energy density would be 1.6 to 3 calories
per gram (7â13 kJ/g); salmon, lean meat, and bread would fall in this
category. High-energy foods would have more than three calories per gram and
include crackers, cheese, dark chocolate, and peanuts.[10]
***** Fuel[edit] *****
Main article: Energy_density
Energy density is sometimes useful for comparing fuels. For example, liquid
hydrogen fuel has a higher specific energy (energy per unit mass) than gasoline
does, but a much lower volumetric energy density.
***** Astrodynamics[edit] *****
Specific_mechanical_energy, rather than simply energy, is often used in
astrodynamics, because gravity changes the kinetic and potential specific
energies of a vehicle in ways that are independent of the mass of the vehicle,
consistent with the conservation_of_energy in a Newtonian_gravitational_system.
The specific energy of an object such as a meteoroid falling on the earth from
outside the earth's gravitational well is at least one half the square of the
escape_velocity of 11.2 km/s. This comes to 63 MJ/kg (15 kcal/g, or 15 tonnes
TNT_equivalent per tonne). Comets have even more energy, typically moving with
respect to the sun, when in our vicinity, at about the square root of two times
the speed of the earth. This comes to 42 km/s, or a specific energy of 882 MJ/
kg. The speed relative to the earth may be more or less, depending on
direction. Since the speed of the earth around the sun is about 30 km/s, a
comet's speed relative to the earth can range from 12 to 72 km/s, the latter
corresponding to 2592 MJ/kg. If a comet with this speed fell to the earth it
would gain another 63 MJ/kg, yielding a total of 2655 MJ/kg with a speed of
72.9 km/s. Since the equator is moving at about 0.5 km/s, the impact speed has
an upper limit of 73.4 km/s, giving an upper limit for the specific energy of a
comet hitting the earth of about 2690 MJ/kg.
If the Hale-Bopp comet (50 km in diameter) had hit the earth, it would have
vaporized the oceans and sterilized the surface of the earth.[11]
***** Miscellaneous[edit] *****
    * Kinetic_energy per unit mass: 1/2v2, where v is the speed (giving J/kg
      when v is in m/s). See also kinetic_energy_per_unit_mass_of_projectiles.
    * Potential_energy with respect to gravity, close to earth, per unit mass:
      gh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (standardized as ~9.8 m/
      s2) and h is the height above the reference level (giving J/kg when g is
      in m/s2 and h is in m).
    * Heat: energies per unit mass are specific_heat_capacity times temperature
      difference, and specific_melting_heat, and specific_heat_of_vaporization
