A hydraulic jump is a phenomenon in the science of hydraulics which is
frequently observed in open_channel_flow such as rivers and spillways. When
liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather
abrupt rise occurs in the liquid surface. The rapidly flowing liquid is
abruptly slowed and increases in height, converting some of the flow's initial
kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy
irreversibly lost through turbulence to heat. In an open channel flow, this
manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling up on top of itself
similar to how a shockwave forms.
It was first observed and documented by Leonardo_da_Vinci in 1500s.[1] The
mathematics were first described by Giorgio_Bidone when he published a paper
called Experiences sur le remou et sur la propagation des ondes.[2]
The phenomenon is dependent upon the initial fluid speed. If the initial speed
of the fluid is below the critical speed, then no jump is possible. For initial
flow speeds which are not significantly above the critical speed, the
transition appears as an undulating wave. As the initial flow speed increases
further, the transition becomes more abrupt, until at high enough speeds, the
transition front will break and curl back upon itself. When this happens, the
jump can be accompanied by violent turbulence, eddying, air entrainment, and
surface undulations, or waves.
There are two main manifestations of hydraulic jumps and historically different
terminology has been used for each. However, the mechanisms behind them are
similar because they are simply variations of each other seen from different
frames of reference, and so the physics and analysis techniques can be used for
both types.
The different manifestations are:
    * The stationary hydraulic jump â rapidly flowing water transitions in a
      stationary jump to slowly moving water as shown in Figures 1 and 2.
    * The tidal_bore â a wall or undulating wave of water moves upstream
      against water flowing downstream as shown in Figures 3 and 4. If
      considered from a frame of reference which moves with the wave front, you
      can see that this case is physically similar to a stationary jump.
A related case is a cascade â a wall or undulating wave of water moves
downstream overtaking a shallower downstream flow of water as shown in Figure
5. If considered from a frame of reference which moves with the wave front,
this is amenable to the same analysis as a stationary jump.
Figure 2: A common example of a hydraulic jump is the roughly circular
stationary wave that forms around the central stream of water. The jump is at
the transition between the point where the circle appears still and where the
turbulence is visible.
These phenomena are addressed in an extensive literature from a number of
technical viewpoints.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]

***** Classes of hydraulic jumps[edit] *****
Figure 3: A tidal bore in Alaska showing a turbulent shock-wave-like front. At
this point the water is relatively shallow and the fractional change in
elevation is large.
Hydraulic jumps can be seen in both a stationary form, which is known as a
"hydraulic jump", and a dynamic or moving form, which is known as a positive
surge or "hydraulic jump in translation".[16] They can be described using the
same analytic approaches and are simply variants of a single phenomenon.[15]
[16][18]
**** Moving hydraulic jump[edit] ****
Figure 4: An undular front on a tidal bore. At this point the water is
relatively deep and the fractional change in elevation is small.
A tidal_bore is a hydraulic jump which occurs when the incoming tide forms a
wave (or waves) of water that travel up a river or narrow bay against the
direction of the current.[16] As is true for hydraulic jumps in general, bores
take on various forms depending upon the difference in the waterlevel upstream
and down, ranging from an undular wavefront to a shock-wave-like wall of water.
[9] Figure 3 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to shallow
upstream water â a large elevation difference is observed. Figure 4 shows a
tidal bore with the characteristics common to deep upstream water â a small
elevation difference is observed and the wavefront undulates. In both cases the
tidal wave moves at the speed characteristic of waves in water of the depth
found immediately behind the wave front. A key feature of tidal bores and
positive surges is the intense turbulent mixing induced by the passage of the
bore front and by the following wave motion.[19]
Figure 5: Series of roll waves moving down a spillway, where they terminate in
a stationary hydraulic jump.
Another variation of the moving hydraulic jump is the cascade. In the cascade,
a series of roll waves or undulating waves of water moves downstream overtaking
a shallower downstream flow of water.
A moving hydraulic jump is called a surge. The travel of wave is faster in the
upper portion than in the lower portion in case of positive surges
**** Stationary hydraulic jump[edit] ****
A stationary hydraulic jump is the type most frequently seen on rivers and on
engineered features such as outfalls of dams and irrigation works. They occur
when a flow of liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of the river or
engineered structure which can only sustain a lower velocity. When this occurs,
the water slows in a rather abrupt rise (a step or standing_wave) on the liquid
surface.[17]
Comparing the characteristics before and after, one finds:

The other stationary hydraulic jump occurs when a rapid flow encounters a
submerged object which throws the water upwards. The mathematics behind this
form is more complex and will need to take into account the shape of the object
and the flow characteristics of the fluid around it.
***** Analysis of the hydraulic jump on a liquid surface[edit] *****
Naturally occurring hydraulic jump observed on the Upper_Spokane_Falls north
channel.
In spite of the apparent complexity of the flow transition, application of
simple analytic tools to a two dimensional analysis is effective in providing
analytic results which closely parallel both field and laboratory results.
Analysis shows:
    * Height of the jump: the relationship between the depths before and after
      the jump as a function of flow rate[18]
    * Energy loss in the jump
    * Location of the jump on a natural or an engineered structure
    * Character of the jump: undular or abrupt
**** Height of the jump[edit] ****
The height of the jump is derived from the application of the equations of
conservation of mass and momentum.[18] There are several methods of predicting
the height of a hydraulic jump.[3][4][5][6][10][15][18][20]
They all reach common conclusions that:
    * The ratio of the water depth before and after the jump depend solely on
      the ratio of velocity of the water entering the jump to the speed of the
      wave over-running the moving water.
    * The height of the jump can be many times the initial depth of the water.
For a known flow rate     q ,   {\displaystyle q,}  [q,] as shown by the figure
below, the approximation that the momentum flux is the same just up- and
downstream of the energy principle yields an expression of the energy loss in
the hydraulic jump. Hydraulic jumps are commonly used as energy dissipators
downstream of dam spillways.
Illustration of behaviour in a hydraulic jump.
  Applying the continuity principle
In fluid dynamics, the equation_of_continuity is effectively an equation of
conservation_of_mass. Considering any fixed closed surface within an
incompressible moving fluid, the fluid flows into a given volume at some points
and flows out at other points along the surface with no net change in mass
within the space since the density is constant. In case of a rectangular
channel, then the equality of mass flux upstream (    &#x03C1;  v  0    h  0
{\displaystyle \rho v_{0}h_{0}}  [\rho v_{0}h_{0}]) and downstream
(    &#x03C1;  v  1    h  1     {\displaystyle \rho v_{1}h_{1}}  [\rho v_{1}h_
{1}]) gives:
          v  0    h  0   =  v  1    h  1   = q   {\displaystyle v_{0}h_{0}=v_
      {1}h_{1}=q}  [v_{0}h_{0}=v_{1}h_{1}=q]   or        v  1   =  v  0      h
      0    h  1     ,   {\displaystyle v_{1}=v_{0}{h_{0} \over h_{1}},}  [
      {\displaystyle v_{1}=v_{0}{h_{0} \over h_{1}},}]
with     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] the fluid density,      v  0
{\displaystyle v_{0}}  [v_{0}] and      v  1     {\displaystyle v_{1}}  [v_{1}]
the depth-averaged flow velocities upstream and downstream, and      h  0
{\displaystyle h_{0}}  [h_{0}] and      h  1     {\displaystyle h_{1}}  [h_{1}]
the corresponding water depths.
  Conservation of momentum flux
For a straight prismatic rectangular channel, the conservation of momentum flux
across the jump, assuming constant density, can be expressed as:
         &#x03C1;  v  0   2    h  0   +   1 2   &#x03C1; g  h  0   2   =
      &#x03C1;  v  1   2    h  1   +   1 2   &#x03C1; g  h  1   2   .
      {\displaystyle \rho v_{0}^{2}h_{0}+{1 \over 2}\rho gh_{0}^{2}=\rho v_{1}^
      {2}h_{1}+{1 \over 2}\rho gh_{1}^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle \rho v_{0}^{2}h_
      {0}+{1 \over 2}\rho gh_{0}^{2}=\rho v_{1}^{2}h_{1}+{1 \over 2}\rho gh_
      {1}^{2}.}]
In rectangular channel, such conservation equation can be further simplified to
dimensionless_M-y_equation_form, which is widely used in hydraulic jump
analysis in open channel flow.
Jump height in terms of flow Dividing by constant     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle
\rho }  [\rho ] and introducing the result from continuity gives
          v  0   2    (   h  0   &#x2212;    h  0   2    h  1      )  +   g 2
      (  h  0   2   &#x2212;  h  1   2   ) = 0.   {\displaystyle v_{0}^{2}\left
      (h_{0}-{h_{0}^{2} \over h_{1}}\right)+{g \over 2}(h_{0}^{2}-h_{1}^
      {2})=0.}  [v_{0}^{2}\left(h_{0}-{h_{0}^{2} \over h_{1}}\right)+{g \over
      2}(h_{0}^{2}-h_{1}^{2})=0.]
which, after some algebra, simplifies to:
           1 2      h  1    h  0      (     h  1    h  0     + 1  )  &#x2212; F
      r  2   = 0 ,   {\displaystyle {1 \over 2}{h_{1} \over h_{0}}\left({h_{1}
      \over h_{0}}+1\right)-Fr^{2}=0,}  [{1 \over 2}{h_{1} \over h_{0}}\left(
      {h_{1} \over h_{0}}+1\right)-Fr^{2}=0,]
where     F  r  2   =    v  0   2    g  h  0      .   {\displaystyle Fr^{2}={v_
{0}^{2} \over gh_{0}}.}  [Fr^{2}={v_{0}^{2} \over gh_{0}}.] Here     F r
{\displaystyle Fr}  [Fr] is the dimensionless Froude_number, and relates
inertial to gravitational forces in the upstream flow. Solving this quadratic
yields:
            h  1    h  0     =    &#x2212; 1 &#x00B1;   1 +    8  v  0   2
      g  h  0         2   .   {\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}={\frac {-1\pm
      {\sqrt {1+{\frac {8v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}}}}{2}}.}  [{\displaystyle {h_{1}
      \over h_{0}}={\frac {-1\pm {\sqrt {1+{\frac {8v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}}}}
      {2}}.}]
Negative answers do not yield meaningful physical solutions, so this reduces
to:
            h  1    h  0     =    &#x2212; 1 +   1 +    8  v  0   2     g  h  0
      2     {\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}={\frac {-1+{\sqrt {1+{\frac {8v_
      {0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}}}}{2}}}  [{\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}={\frac {-
      1+{\sqrt {1+{\frac {8v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}}}}{2}}}]   so
            h  1    h  0     =      1 +  8 F  r  2      &#x2212; 1  2   ,
      {\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}={\frac {{\sqrt {1+{8Fr^{2}}}}-1}{2}},}
      [{\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}={\frac {{\sqrt {1+{8Fr^{2}}}}-1}
      {2}},}]
known as BÃ©langer equation. The result may be extended to an irregular cross-
section.[18]

This produces three solution classes:
    * When        v  0   2    g  h  0      = 1   {\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^
      {2}}{gh_{0}}}=1}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}=1}], then
      h  1    h  0     = 1   {\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}=1}  [{h_{1}
      \over h_{0}}=1] (i.e., there is no jump)
    * When        v  0   2    g  h  0      < 1   {\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^
      {2}}{gh_{0}}}<1}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}<1}], then
      h  1    h  0     < 1   {\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}<1}  [{h_{1}
      \over h_{0}}<1] (i.e., there is a negative jump â this can be shown as
      not conserving energy and is only physically possible if some force were
      to accelerate the fluid at that point)
    * When        v  0   2    g  h  0      > 1   {\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^
      {2}}{gh_{0}}}>1}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}>1}], then
      h  1    h  0     > 1   {\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}>1}  [{h_{1}
      \over h_{0}}>1] (i.e., there is a positive jump)
This is equivalent to the condition that     &#xA0; F r > 1   {\displaystyle \
Fr>1}  [\ Fr>1]. Since the     &#xA0;   g  h  0       {\displaystyle \ {\sqrt
{gh_{0}}}}  [\ {\sqrt {gh_{0}}}] is the speed of a shallow gravity_wave, the
condition that     F r > 1   {\displaystyle Fr>1}  [Fr>1] is equivalent to
stating that the initial velocity represents supercritical_flow (Froude number
> 1) while the final velocity represents subcritical_flow (Froude number < 1).
  Undulations downstream of the jump
Practically this means that water accelerated by large drops can create
stronger standing waves (undular_bores) in the form of hydraulic jumps as it
decelerates at the base of the drop. Such standing waves, when found downstream
of a weir or natural rock ledge, can form an extremely dangerous "keeper" with
a water wall that "keeps" floating objects (e.g., logs, kayaks, or kayakers)
recirculating in the standing wave for extended periods.
**** Energy dissipation by a hydraulic jump[edit] ****
Saint_Anthony_Falls on the Mississippi_River showing a pronounced hydraulic
jump.
One of the most important engineering applications of the hydraulic jump is to
dissipate energy in channels, dam spillways, and similar structures so that the
excess kinetic energy does not damage these structures. The rate of energy
dissipation or head_loss across a hydraulic jump is a function of the hydraulic
jump inflow Froude number and the height of the jump.[15]
The mathematical formula for Energy loss in hydraulic jump is as follows:
   &#x0394; E =    (  y  2   &#x2212;  y  1    )  3     4  y  1    y  2
{\displaystyle \Delta E={\frac {(y_{2}-y_{1})^{3}}{4y_{1}y_{2}}}}  [\Delta E=
{\frac {(y_{2}-y_{1})^{3}}{4y_{1}y_{2}}}][21]
where:
y1 - upstream flow depth;
y2 - downstream flow depth.
**** Location of hydraulic jump in a streambed or an engineered structure[edit]
****
In the design of a dam the energy of the fast-flowing stream over a spillway
must be partially dissipated to prevent erosion of the streambed downstream of
the spillway, which could ultimately lead to failure of the dam. This can be
done by arranging for the formation of a hydraulic jump to dissipate energy. To
limit damage, this hydraulic jump normally occurs on an apron engineered to
withstand hydraulic forces and to prevent local cavitation and other phenomena
which accelerate erosion.
In the design of a spillway and apron, the engineers select the point at which
a hydraulic jump will occur. Obstructions or slope changes are routinely
designed into the apron to force a jump at a specific location. Obstructions
are unnecessary, as the slope change alone is normally sufficient. To trigger
the hydraulic jump without obstacles, an apron is designed such that the flat
slope of the apron retards the rapidly flowing water from the spillway. If the
apron slope is insufficient to maintain the original high velocity, a jump will
occur.
Supercritical flow down the Cleveland_Dam spillway at the head of the Capilano
River in North_Vancouver,_British_Columbia, Canada.
Two methods of designing an induced jump are common:
    * If the downstream flow is restricted by the down-stream channel such that
      water backs up onto the foot of the spillway, that downstream water level
      can be used to identify the location of the jump.
    * If the spillway continues to drop for some distance, but the slope
      changes such that it will no longer support supercritical flow, the depth
      in the lower subcritical flow region is sufficient to determine the
      location of the jump.
In both cases, the final depth of the water is determined by the downstream
characteristics. The jump will occur if and only if the level of inflowing
(supercritical) water level (     h  0     {\displaystyle h_{0}}  [h_{0}])
satisfies the condition:
          h  0   =    h  1   2    (  &#x2212; 1 +   1 + 8 F  r  2   2      )
      {\displaystyle h_{0}={h_{1} \over 2}\left({-1+{\sqrt {1+8Fr_{2}^
      {2}}}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle h_{0}={h_{1} \over 2}\left({-1+{\sqrt
      {1+8Fr_{2}^{2}}}}\right)}]
         F r   {\displaystyle Fr}  [Fr] = Upstream Froude Number
      g = acceleration_due_to_gravity (essentially constant for this case)
      h = height of the fluid (     h  0     {\displaystyle h_{0}}  [h_{0}] =
      initial height while      h  1     {\displaystyle h_{1}}  [h_{1}] =
      upstream height)
**** Air entrainment in hydraulic jumps[edit] ****
The hydraulic jump is characterised by a highly turbulent flow. Macro-scale
vortices develop in the jump roller and interact with the free surface leading
to air bubble entrainment, splashes and droplets formation in the two-phase
flow region.[22][23] The airâwater flow is associated with turbulence, which
can also lead to sediment transport. The turbulence may be strongly affected by
the bubble dynamics. Physically, the mechanisms involved in these processes are
complex.
The air entrainment occurs in the form of air bubbles and air packets entrapped
at the impingement of the upstream jet flow with the roller. The air packets
are broken up in very small air bubbles as they are entrained in the shear
region, characterised by large air contents and maximum bubble count rates.[24]
Once the entrained bubbles are advected into regions of lesser shear, bubble
collisions and coalescence lead to larger air entities that are driven towards
the free-surface by a combination of buoyancy and turbulent advection.

NB: the above classification is very rough. Undular hydraulic jumps have been
observed with inflow/prejump Froude numbers up to 3.5 to 4.[15][16]
***** Hydraulic jump variations[edit] *****
A number of variations are amenable to similar analysis:
**** Shallow fluid hydraulic jumps[edit] ****
  The hydraulic jump in a sink
Figure 2 above[where?] illustrates an example of a hydraulic jump, often seen
in a kitchen sink. Around the place where the tap water hits the sink, a
smooth-looking flow pattern will occur. A little further away,[quantify] a
sudden "jump" in the water level will be present. This is a hydraulic jump.
On impingement of a liquid jet normally on to a surface, the liquid spreads
radially in a thin film until a point where the film thickness changes
abruptly. This abrupt change in liquid film thickness is called a circular
hydraulic jump. So far, It was believed that the thin film hydraulic jumps are
created due to gravity (related to the Froude number). However, a recent
scientific article published in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics disapproved this
more than century-old belief.[25] The authors experimentally and theoretically
showed that kitchen sink hydraulic jumps are created due to surface tension and
not due to gravity. To rule out the role of gravity in the formation of a
circular hydraulic jump, authors performed experiments on horizontal, vertical
and on an inclined surface and showed that irrespective of the orientation of
the substrate, for same flow rate and physical properties of the liquid, the
initial hydraulic jump happens at the same location. They theoretically
explained the phenomenon and found the general criterion for a thin film
hydraulic jump to be
           1  W e    +   1  F  r  2      = 1   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{We}}+
      {\frac {1}{Fr^{2}}}=1}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{We}}+{\frac {1}{Fr^
      {2}}}=1}]
where     W e   {\displaystyle We}  [{\displaystyle We}] is the local Weber
number and     F r   {\displaystyle Fr}  [Fr] is the local Froude number. For
kitchen sink scale hydraulic jumps, the Froude number remains high, therefore,
the effective criteria for the thin film hydraulic jump is     W e = 1
{\displaystyle We=1}  [{\displaystyle We=1}]. In other words, a thin film
hydraulic jump occurs when the liquid momentum per unit width equals the
surface tension of the liquid.[25]
**** Internal wave hydraulic jumps[edit] ****
*** Hydraulic jumps in abyssal fan formation[edit] ***
Turbidity_currents can result in internal hydraulic jumps (i.e., hydraulic
jumps as internal_waves in fluids of different density) in abyssal_fan
formation. The internal hydraulic jumps have been associated with salinity or
temperature induced stratification as well as with density differences due to
suspended materials. When the slope of the bed (over which the turbidity
current flows) flattens, the slower rate of flow is mirrored by increased
sediment deposition below the flow, producing a gradual backward slope. Where a
hydraulic jump occurs, the signature is an abrupt backward slope, corresponding
to the rapid reduction in the flow rate at the point of the jump.[26]
*** Atmospheric hydraulic jumps[edit] ***
Hydraulic jumps occur in the atmosphere in the air flowing over mountains.[27]
A related situation is the Morning_Glory_cloud observed, for example, in
Northern Australia, sometimes called an undular jump.[16]
***** Industrial and recreational applications for hydraulic jumps[edit] *****
Energy dissipation using hydraulic jump.
**** Industrial[edit] ****
The hydraulic jump is the most commonly used choice of design engineers for
energy dissipation below spillways and outlets. A properly designed hydraulic
jump can provide for 60-70% energy dissipation of the energy in the basin
itself, limiting the damage to structures and the streambed. Even with such
efficient energy dissipation, stilling basins must be carefully designed to
avoid serious damage due to uplift, vibration, cavitation, and abrasion. An
extensive literature has been developed for this type of engineering.[7][8][13]
[15]
**** Recreational[edit] ****
Kayak playing on the transition between the turbulent flow and the
recirculation region in the pier wake.
While travelling down river, kayaking and canoeing paddlers will often stop and
playboat in standing waves and hydraulic jumps. The standing waves and shock
fronts of hydraulic jumps make for popular locations for such recreation.
Similarly, kayakers and surfers have been known to ride tidal_bores up rivers.
Hydraulic jumps have been used by glider_pilots in the Andes and Alps[27] and
to ride Morning_Glory_effects in Australia.[28]
