Soil mechanics is a branch of soil_physics and applied_mechanics that describes
the behavior of soils. It differs from fluid mechanics and solid mechanics in
the sense that soils consist of a heterogeneous mixture of fluids (usually air
and water) and particles (usually clay, silt, sand, and gravel) but soil may
also contain organic solids and other matter.[1][2][3][4] Along with rock
mechanics, soil mechanics provides the theoretical basis for analysis in
geotechnical_engineering,[5] a subdiscipline of civil_engineering, and
engineering_geology, a subdiscipline of geology. Soil mechanics is used to
analyze the deformations of and flow of fluids within natural and man-made
structures that are supported on or made of soil, or structures that are buried
in soils.[6] Example applications are building and bridge foundations,
retaining walls, dams, and buried pipeline systems. Principles of soil
mechanics are also used in related disciplines such as engineering geology,
geophysical_engineering, coastal_engineering, agricultural_engineering,
hydrology and soil_physics.
This article describes the genesis and composition of soil, the distinction
between pore water pressure and inter-granular effective stress, capillary
action of fluids in the soil_pore spaces, soil classification, seepage and
permeability, time dependent change of volume due to squeezing water out of
tiny pore spaces, also known as consolidation, shear strength and stiffness of
soils. The shear strength of soils is primarily derived from friction between
the particles and interlocking, which are very sensitive to the effective
stress.[6] The article concludes with some examples of applications of the
principles of soil mechanics such as slope stability, lateral earth pressure on
retaining walls, and bearing capacity of foundations.

***** Genesis and composition of soils[edit] *****
**** Genesis[edit] ****
The primary mechanism of soil creation is the weathering of rock. All rock
types (igneous_rock, metamorphic_rock and sedimentary_rock) may be broken down
into small particles to create soil. Weathering mechanisms are physical
weathering, chemical weathering, and biological weathering [1][2][3] Human
activities such as excavation, blasting, and waste disposal, may also create
soil. Over geologic time, deeply buried soils may be altered by pressure and
temperature to become metamorphic or sedimentary rock, and if melted and
solidified again, they would complete the geologic cycle by becoming igneous
rock.[3]
Physical weathering includes temperature effects, freeze and thaw of water in
cracks, rain, wind, impact and other mechanisms. Chemical weathering includes
dissolution of matter composing a rock and precipitation in the form of another
mineral. Clay minerals, for example can be formed by weathering of feldspar,
which is the most common mineral present in igneous rock.
The most common mineral constituent of silt and sand is quartz, also called
silica, which has the chemical name silicon dioxide. The reason that feldspar
is most common in rocks but silica is more prevalent in soils is that feldspar
is much more soluble than silica.
Silt, Sand, and Gravel are basically little pieces of broken rocks.
According to the Unified_Soil_Classification_System, silt particle sizes are in
the range of 0.002 mm to 0.075 mm and sand particles have sizes in the range of
0.075 mm to 4.75 mm.
Gravel particles are broken pieces of rock in the size range 4.75 mm to 100 mm.
Particles larger than gravel are called cobbles and boulders.[1][2]
**** Transport[edit] ****
Example soil horizons. a) top soil and colluvium b) mature residual soil c)
young residual soil d) weathered rock.
Soil deposits are affected by the mechanism of transport and deposition to
their location. Soils that are not transported are called residual_soilsâthey
exist at the same location as the rock from which they were generated.
Decomposed_granite is a common example of a residual soil. The common
mechanisms of transport are the actions of gravity, ice, water, and wind. Wind
blown soils include dune sands and loess. Water carries particles of different
size depending on the speed of the water, thus soils transported by water are
graded according to their size. Silt and clay may settle out in a lake, and
gravel and sand collect at the bottom of a river bed. Wind blown soil deposits
(aeolian soils) also tend to be sorted according to their grain size. Erosion
at the base of glaciers is powerful enough to pick up large rocks and boulders
as well as soil; soils dropped by melting ice can be a well graded mixture of
widely varying particle sizes. Gravity on its own may also carry particles down
from the top of a mountain to make a pile of soil and boulders at the base;
soil deposits transported by gravity are called colluvium.[1][2]
The mechanism of transport also has a major effect on the particle shape. For
example, low velocity grinding in a river bed will produce rounded particles.
Freshly fractured colluvium particles often have a very angular shape.
**** Soil composition[edit] ****
*** Soil mineralogy[edit] ***
Silts, sands and gravels are classified by their size, and hence they may
consist of a variety of minerals. Owing to the stability of quartz compared to
other rock minerals, quartz is the most common constituent of sand and silt.
Mica, and feldspar are other common minerals present in sands and silts.[1] The
mineral constituents of gravel may be more similar to that of the parent rock.
The common clay minerals are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite
or kaolin. These minerals tend to form in sheet or plate like structures, with
length typically ranging between 10â7 m and 4x10â6 m and thickness
typically ranging between 10â9 m and 2x10â6 m, and they have a relatively
large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the
ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay
minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000
square meters per gram of solid.[3] Due to the large surface area available for
chemical, electrostatic, and van_der_Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior
of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and
the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid.[1] To anticipate the
effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds
of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers
know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very
unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when
dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause
retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and
difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays,
formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.
The minerals of soils are predominantly formed by atoms of oxygen, silicon,
hydrogen, and aluminum, organized in various crystalline forms. These elements
along with calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and carbon constitute over 99
per cent of the solid mass of soils.[1]
*** Grain size distribution[edit] ***
Main article: Soil_gradation
Soils consist of a mixture of particles of different size, shape and
mineralogy. Because the size of the particles obviously has a significant
effect on the soil behavior, the grain size and grain size distribution are
used to classify soils. The grain size distribution describes the relative
proportions of particles of various sizes. The grain size is often visualized
in a cumulative distribution graph which, for example, plots the percentage of
particles finer than a given size as a function of size. The median grain size,
D  50     {\displaystyle D_{50}}  [D_{50} ], is the size for which 50% of the
particle mass consists of finer particles. Soil behavior, especially the
hydraulic_conductivity, tends to be dominated by the smaller particles, hence,
the term "effective size", denoted by      D  10     {\displaystyle D_{10}}
[D_{10} ], is defined as the size for which 10% of the particle mass consists
of finer particles.
Sands and gravels that possess a wide range of particle sizes with a smooth
distribution of particle sizes are called well graded soils. If the soil
particles in a sample are predominantly in a relatively narrow range of sizes,
the sample is uniformly graded. If a soil sample has distinct gaps in the
gradation curve, e.g., a mixture of gravel and fine sand, with no coarse sand,
the sample may be gap graded. Uniformly graded and gap graded soils are both
considered to be poorly graded. There are many methods for measuring particle-
size_distribution. The two traditional methods are sieve analysis and
hydrometer analysis.
** Sieve analysis[edit] **
Sieve
The size distribution of gravel and sand particles are typically measured using
sieve analysis. The formal procedure is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009).[7] A
stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is
used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil,
with clods broken down to individual particles, is put into the top of a stack
of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a
standard period of time so that the particles are sorted into size bins. This
method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range.
Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is
not an effective method. If there are a lot of fines (silt and clay) present in
the soil it may be necessary to run water through the sieves to wash the coarse
particles and clods through.
A variety of sieve sizes are available. The boundary between sand and silt is
arbitrary. According to the Unified_Soil_Classification_System, a #4 sieve (4
openings per inch) having 4.75mm opening size separates sand from gravel and a
#200 sieve with an 0.075 mm opening separates sand from silt and clay.
According to the British standard, 0.063 mm is the boundary between sand and
silt, and 2 mm is the boundary between sand and gravel.[3]
** Hydrometer analysis[edit] **
The classification of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand,
is determined primarily by their Atterberg_limits, not by their grain size. If
it is important to determine the grain size distribution of fine-grained soils,
the hydrometer test may be performed. In the hydrometer tests, the soil
particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a
glass cylinder, and then the cylinder is left to sit. A hydrometer is used to
measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. Clay particles may
take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the hydrometer.
Sand particles may take less than a second. Stoke's_law provides the
theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity
and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the
Hydrometer test.
Clay particles can be sufficiently small that they never settle because they
are kept in suspension by Brownian_motion, in which case they may be classified
as colloids.
*** Mass-volume relations[edit] ***
A phase diagram of soil indicating the masses and volumes of air, solid, water,
and voids.
There are a variety of parameters used to describe the relative proportions of
air, water and solid in a soil. This section defines these parameters and some
of their interrelationships.[2][6] The basic notation is as follows:
    V  a     {\displaystyle V_{a}}  [V_{a}],      V  w     {\displaystyle V_
{w}}  [V_w], and      V  s     {\displaystyle V_{s}}  [V_s] represent the
volumes of air, water and solids in a soil mixture;
    W  a     {\displaystyle W_{a}}  [W_a],      W  w     {\displaystyle W_{w}}
[W_w], and      W  s     {\displaystyle W_{s}}  [W_s] represent the weights of
air, water and solids in a soil mixture;
    M  a     {\displaystyle M_{a}}  [M_a],      M  w     {\displaystyle M_{w}}
[M_{w}], and      M  s     {\displaystyle M_{s}}  [M_{s}] represent the masses
of air, water and solids in a soil mixture;
    &#x03C1;  a     {\displaystyle \rho _{a}}  [\rho_a],      &#x03C1;  w
{\displaystyle \rho _{w}}  [\rho_w], and      &#x03C1;  s     {\displaystyle
\rho _{s}}  [\rho_s] represent the densities of the constituents (air, water
and solids) in a soil mixture;
Note that the weights, W, can be obtained by multiplying the mass, M, by the
acceleration due to gravity, g; e.g.,      W  s   =  M  s   g   {\displaystyle
W_{s}=M_{s}g}  [W_s = M_s g]
Specific_Gravity is the ratio of the density of one material compared to the
density of pure water (     &#x03C1;  w   = 1 g  /  c  m  3     {\displaystyle
\rho _{w}=1g/cm^{3}}  [\rho_w = 1 g/cm^3]).
Specific gravity of solids,      G  s   =    &#x03C1;  s    &#x03C1;  w
{\displaystyle G_{s}={\frac {\rho _{s}}{\rho _{w}}}}  [G_s = \frac{\rho_s}
{\rho_w}]
Note that specific_weight, conventionally denoted by the symbol     &#x03B3;
{\displaystyle \gamma }  [\gamma ] may be obtained by multiplying the density
(     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] ) of a material by the
acceleration due to gravity,     g   {\displaystyle g}  [g].
Density, Bulk Density, or Wet Density,     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }
[\rho ], are different names for the density of the mixture, i.e., the total
mass of air, water, solids divided by the total volume of air water and solids
(the mass of air is assumed to be zero for practical purposes):
         &#x03C1; =     M  s   +  M  w      V  s   +  V  w   +  V  a      =
      M  t    V  t       {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {M_{s}+M_{w}}{V_{s}+V_
      {w}+V_{a}}}={\frac {M_{t}}{V_{t}}}}  [\rho = \frac{M_s + M_w}{V_s + V_w +
      V_a}= \frac{M_t}{V_t}]
Dry Density,      &#x03C1;  d     {\displaystyle \rho _{d}}  [\rho _d], is the
mass of solids divided by the total volume of air water and solids:
          &#x03C1;  d   =    M  s     V  s   +  V  w   +  V  a      =    M  s
      V  t       {\displaystyle \rho _{d}={\frac {M_{s}}{V_{s}+V_{w}+V_{a}}}=
      {\frac {M_{s}}{V_{t}}}}  [\rho_d = \frac{M_s}{V_s + V_w + V_a}= \frac
      {M_s}{V_t}]
Buoyant Density,      &#x03C1; &#x2032;    {\displaystyle \rho '}  [\rho '],
defined as the density of the mixture minus the density of water is useful if
the soil is submerged under water:
          &#x03C1; &#x2032;  = &#x03C1; &#xA0; &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  w
      {\displaystyle \rho '=\rho \ -\rho _{w}}  [\rho ' = \rho\ - \rho _w]
where      &#x03C1;  w     {\displaystyle \rho _{w}}  [\rho _w] is the density
of water
Water Content,     w   {\displaystyle w}  [w] is the ratio of mass of water to
mass of solid. It is easily measured by weighing a sample of the soil, drying
it out in an oven and re-weighing. Standard procedures are described by ASTM.
         w =    M  w    M  s     =    W  w    W  s       {\displaystyle w=
      {\frac {M_{w}}{M_{s}}}={\frac {W_{w}}{W_{s}}}}  [w = \frac{M_w}{M_s} =
      \frac{W_w}{W_s}]
Void ratio,     e   {\displaystyle e}  [e], is the ratio of the volume of voids
to the volume of solids:
         e =    V  v    V  s     =    V  v     V  T   &#x2212;  V  V      =   n
      1 &#x2212; n      {\displaystyle e={\frac {V_{v}}{V_{s}}}={\frac {V_{v}}
      {V_{T}-V_{V}}}={\frac {n}{1-n}}}  [{\displaystyle e={\frac {V_{v}}{V_
      {s}}}={\frac {V_{v}}{V_{T}-V_{V}}}={\frac {n}{1-n}}}]
Porosity,     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n], is the ratio of volume of voids to
the total volume, and is related to the void ratio:
         n =    V  v    V  t     =    V  v     V  s   +  V  v      =   e  1 + e
      {\displaystyle n={\frac {V_{v}}{V_{t}}}={\frac {V_{v}}{V_{s}+V_{v}}}=
      {\frac {e}{1+e}}}  [n = \frac{V_v}{V_t} = \frac{V_v}{V_s + V_v}= \frac{e}
      {1 + e}]
Degree of saturation,     S   {\displaystyle S}  [S], is the ratio of the
volume of water to the volume of voids:
         S =    V  w    V  v       {\displaystyle S={\frac {V_{w}}{V_{v}}}}  [S
      = \frac{V_w}{V_v} ]
From the above definitions, some useful relationships can be derived by use of
basic algebra.
         &#x03C1; =    (  G  s   + S e )  &#x03C1;  w     1 + e
      {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {(G_{s}+Se)\rho _{w}}{1+e}}}  [\rho = \frac{
      (G_s+Se)\rho_w}{1+e}]
         &#x03C1; =    ( 1 + w )  G  s    &#x03C1;  w     1 + e
      {\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {(1+w)G_{s}\rho _{w}}{1+e}}}  [\rho = \frac{
      (1+w)G_s\rho_w}{1+e}]
         w =    S e   G  s       {\displaystyle w={\frac {Se}{G_{s}}}}  [w =
      \frac{S e}{G_s}]
***** Soil classification[edit] *****
Geotechnical engineers classify the soil particle types by performing tests on
disturbed (dried, passed through sieves, and remolded) samples of the soil.
This provides information about the characteristics of the soil grains
themselves. Classification of the types of grains present in a soil does not
account for important effects of the structure or fabric of the soil, terms
that describe compactness of the particles and patterns in the arrangement of
particles in a load carrying framework as well as the pore size and pore fluid
distributions. Engineering geologists also classify soils based on their
genesis and depositional history.
**** Classification of soil grains[edit] ****
In the US and other countries, the Unified_Soil_Classification_System (USCS) is
often used for soil classification. Other classification systems include the
British Standard BS_5930 and the AASHTO soil classification system.[3]
*** Classification of sands and gravels[edit] ***
In the USCS, gravels (given the symbol G) and sands (given the symbol S) are
classified according to their grain size distribution. For the USCS, gravels
may be given the classification symbol GW (well-graded gravel), GP (poorly
graded gravel), GM (gravel with a large amount of silt), or GC (gravel with a
large amount of clay). Likewise sands may be classified as being SW, SP, SM or
SC. Sands and gravels with a small but non-negligible amount of fines (5â12%)
may be given a dual classification such as SW-SC.
*** Atterberg limits[edit] ***
Clays and Silts, often called 'fine-grained soils', are classified according to
their Atterberg_limits; the most commonly used Atterberg limits are the Liquid
Limit (denoted by LL or      w  l     {\displaystyle w_{l}}  [w_l]), Plastic
Limit (denoted by PL or      w  p     {\displaystyle w_{p}}  [w_p]), and
Shrinkage Limit (denoted by SL).
The Liquid Limit is the water content at which the soil behavior transitions
from a plastic solid to a liquid. The Plastic Limit is the water content at
which the soil behavior transitions from that of a plastic solid to a brittle
solid. The Shrinkage Limit corresponds to a water content below which the soil
will not shrink as it dries.The consistency of fine grained soil varies in
proportional to the water content in a soil.
As the transitions from one state to another are gradual, the tests have
adopted arbitrary definitions to determine the boundaries of the states. The
liquid limit is determined by measuring the water content for which a groove
closes after 25 blows in a standard test.[8] Alternatively, a fall_cone_test
apparatus may be use to measure the liquid limit. The undrained shear strength
of remolded soil at the liquid limit is approximately 2 kPa.[4][9] The Plastic
Limit is the water content below which it is not possible to roll by hand the
soil into 3 mm diameter cylinders. The soil cracks or breaks up as it is rolled
down to this diameter. Remolded soil at the plastic limit is quite stiff,
having an undrained shear strength of the order of about 200 kPa.[4][9]
The Plasticity Index of a particular soil specimen is defined as the difference
between the Liquid Limit and the Plastic Limit of the specimen; it is an
indicator of how much water the soil particles in the specimen can absorb, and
correlates with many engineering properties like permeability, compressibility,
shear strength and others.Generally, the clay having high plasticity have lower
permeability and also they are also difficult to be compacted.
*** Classification of silts and clays[edit] ***
According to the Unified_Soil_Classification_System (USCS), silts and clays are
classified by plotting the values of their plasticity_index and liquid_limit on
a plasticity chart. The A-Line on the chart separates clays (given the USCS
symbol C) from silts (given the symbol M). LL=50% separates high plasticity
soils (given the modifier symbol H) from low plasticity soils (given the
modifier symbol L). A soil that plots above the A-line and has LL>50% would,
for example, be classified as CH. Other possible classifications of silts and
clays are ML, CL and MH. If the Atterberg limits plot in the"hatched" region on
the graph near the origin, the soils are given the dual classification 'CL-ML'.
**** Indices related to soil strength[edit] ****
*** Liquidity index[edit] ***
The effects of the water content on the strength of saturated remolded soils
can be quantified by the use of the liquidity index, LI:
         L I =    w &#x2212; P L   L L &#x2212; P L      {\displaystyle LI=
      {\frac {w-PL}{LL-PL}}}  [ LI = \frac{w-PL}{LL-PL}]
When the LI is 1, remolded soil is at the liquid_limit and it has an undrained
shear strength of about 2 kPa. When the soil is at the plastic_limit, the LI is
0 and the undrained shear strength is about 200 kPa.[4][10]
*** Relative density[edit] ***
The density of sands (cohesionless soils) is often characterized by the
relative density,      D  r     {\displaystyle D_{r}}  [ D_r]
          D  r   =     e  m a x   &#x2212; e    e  m a x   &#x2212;  e  m i n
      100 &#x0025;   {\displaystyle D_{r}={\frac {e_{max}-e}{e_{max}-e_
      {min}}}100\%}  [ D_r= \frac{e_{max} - e}{e_{max} - e_{min}} 100\%]
where:      e  m a x     {\displaystyle e_{max}}  [e_{max}] is the "maximum
void ratio" corresponding to a very loose state,      e  m i n
{\displaystyle e_{min}}  [e_{min}] is the "minimum void ratio" corresponding to
a very dense state and     e   {\displaystyle e}  [e] is the in situ void
ratio. Methods used to calculate relative density are defined in ASTM D4254-00
(2006).[11]
Thus if      D  r   = 100 &#x0025;   {\displaystyle D_{r}=100\%}  [ D_r =
100\%] the sand or gravel is very dense, and if      D  r   = 0 &#x0025;
{\displaystyle D_{r}=0\%}  [ D_r = 0\%] the soil is extremely loose and
unstable.

according to     u =  &#x03C1;  w   g  z  w     {\displaystyle u=\rho _{w}gz_
{w}}  [u = \rho_w g z_w] then hydrostatic conditions will prevail and the
fluids will not be flowing through the soil.      z  w     {\displaystyle z_
{w}}  [z_w] is the depth below the water table. However, if the water table is
sloping or there is a perched water table as indicated in the accompanying
sketch, then seepage will occur. For steady state seepage, the seepage
velocities are not varying with time. If the water tables are changing levels
with time, or if the soil is in the process of consolidation, then steady state
conditions do not apply.
**** Darcy's law[edit] ****
Diagram showing definitions and directions for Darcy's law
Darcy's_law states that the volume of flow of the pore fluid through a porous
medium per unit time is proportional to the rate of change of excess fluid
pressure with distance. The constant of proportionality includes the viscosity
of the fluid and the intrinsic permeability of the soil. For the simple case of
a horizontal tube filled with soil
         Q =    &#x2212; K A  &#x03BC;      (  u  b   &#x2212;  u  a   )  L
      {\displaystyle Q={\frac {-KA}{\mu }}{\frac {(u_{b}-u_{a})}{L}}}  [Q=\frac
      {-K A}{\mu}\frac{(u_b-u_a)}{L}]
The total discharge,     Q   {\displaystyle Q}  [Q] (having units of volume per
time, e.g., ftÂ³/s or mÂ³/s), is proportional to the intrinsic_permeability,
K   {\displaystyle K}  [K], the cross sectional area,     A   {\displaystyle A}
[A], and rate of pore pressure change with distance,         u  b   &#x2212;  u
a    L     {\displaystyle {\frac {u_{b}-u_{a}}{L}}}  [\frac{u_b-u_a}{L}], and
inversely proportional to the dynamic_viscosity of the fluid,     &#x03BC;
{\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ]. The negative sign is needed because fluids flow
from high pressure to low pressure. So if the change in pressure is negative
(in the     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x]-direction) then the flow will be
positive (in the     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x]-direction). The above equation
works well for a horizontal tube, but if the tube was inclined so that point b
was a different elevation than point a, the equation would not work. The effect
of elevation is accounted for by replacing the pore pressure by excess pore
pressure,      u  e     {\displaystyle u_{e}}  [u_e] defined as:
    u  e   = u &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  w   g z   {\displaystyle u_{e}=u-\rho _
{w}gz}  [u_e = u - \rho_w g z]
where     z   {\displaystyle z}  [z] is the depth measured from an arbitrary
elevation reference (datum). Replacing     u   {\displaystyle u}  [u] by      u
e     {\displaystyle u_{e}}  [u_e] we obtain a more general equation for flow:
         Q =    &#x2212; K A  &#x03BC;      (  u  e , b   &#x2212;  u  e , a
      )  L     {\displaystyle Q={\frac {-KA}{\mu }}{\frac {(u_{e,b}-u_{e,a})}
      {L}}}  [Q=\frac{-K A}{\mu}\frac{(u_{e,b}-u_{e,a})}{L}]
Dividing both sides of the equation by     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A], and
expressing the rate of change of excess pore pressure as a derivative, we
obtain a more general equation for the apparent velocity in the x-direction:
          v  x   =    &#x2212; K  &#x03BC;      d  u  e     d x
      {\displaystyle v_{x}={\frac {-K}{\mu }}{\frac {du_{e}}{dx}}}  [v_x=\frac
      {-K }{\mu}\frac{d u_e}{d x}]
where      v  x   = Q  /  A   {\displaystyle v_{x}=Q/A}  [v_x = Q/A] has units
of velocity and is called the Darcy velocity (or the specific discharge,
filtration velocity, or superficial velocity). The pore or interstitial
velocity      v  p x     {\displaystyle v_{px}}  [v_{px}] is the average
velocity of fluid molecules in the pores; it is related to the Darcy velocity
and the porosity     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] through the Dupuit-Forchheimer
relationship
          v  p x   =    v  x   n     {\displaystyle v_{px}={\frac {v_{x}}{n}}}
      [v_{px}=\frac{v_x}{n}]
(Some authors use the term seepage velocity to mean the Darcy velocity,[12]
while others use it to mean the pore velocity.[13])
Civil_engineers predominantly work on problems that involve water and
predominantly work on problems on earth (in earth's gravity). For this class of
problems, civil engineers will often write Darcy's law in a much simpler form:
[4][6][14]
         v = k i   {\displaystyle v=ki}  [v = k i]
where     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] is the hydraulic_conductivity, defined as
k =    K  &#x03C1;  w   g   &#x03BC;  w       {\displaystyle k={\frac {K\rho _
{w}g}{\mu _{w}}}}  [k = \frac {K \rho_w g} {\mu_w}], and     i   {\displaystyle
i}  [i] is the hydraulic_gradient. The hydraulic gradient is the rate of change
of total_head with distance. The total head,     h   {\displaystyle h}  [h] at
a point is defined as the height (measured relative to the datum) to which
water would rise in a piezometer at that point. The total head is related to
the excess water pressure by:
          u  e   =  &#x03C1;  w   g h + C o n s t a n t   {\displaystyle u_
      {e}=\rho _{w}gh+Constant}  [u_e = \rho_w g h + Constant ]
and the     C o n s t a n t   {\displaystyle Constant}  [ Constant ] is zero if
the datum for head measurement is chosen at the same elevation as the origin
for the depth, z used to calculate      u  e     {\displaystyle u_{e}}  [ u_e
].
**** Typical values of hydraulic conductivity[edit] ****
Values of hydraulic conductivity,     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k], can vary by
many orders of magnitude depending on the soil type. Clays may have hydraulic
conductivity as small as about      10  &#x2212; 12     m s     {\displaystyle
10^{-12}{\frac {m}{s}}}  [10^{-12}\frac{m}{s}], gravels may have hydraulic
conductivity up to about      10  &#x2212; 1     m s     {\displaystyle 10^{-1}
{\frac {m}{s}}}  [10^{-1}\frac{m}{s}]. Layering and heterogeneity and
disturbance during the sampling and testing process make the accurate
measurement of soil hydraulic conductivity a very difficult problem.[4]
**** Flownets[edit] ****
Main article: Flownet
A plan flow net to estimate flow of water from a stream to a discharging well
Darcy's Law applies in one, two or three dimensions.[3] In two or three
dimensions, steady state seepage is described by Laplace's_equation. Computer
programs are available to solve this equation. But traditionally two-
dimensional seepage problems were solved using a graphical procedure known as
flownet.[3][14][15] One set of lines in the flownet are in the direction of the
water flow (flow lines), and the other set of lines are in the direction of
constant total head (equipotential lines). Flownets may be used to estimate the
quantity of seepage under dams and sheet_piling.
**** Seepage forces and erosion[edit] ****
When the seepage velocity is great enough, erosion can occur because of the
frictional drag exerted on the soil particles. Vertically upwards seepage is a
source of danger on the downstream side of sheet piling and beneath the toe of
a dam or levee. Erosion of the soil, known as "soil piping", can lead to
failure of the structure and to sinkhole formation. Seeping water removes soil,
starting from the exit point of the seepage, and erosion advances upgradient.
[16] The term "sand boil" is used to describe the appearance of the discharging
end of an active soil pipe.[17]
**** Seepage pressures[edit] ****
Seepage in an upward direction reduces the effective stress within the soil.
When the water pressure at a point in the soil is equal to the total vertical
stress at that point, the effective stress is zero and the soil has no
frictional resistance to deformation. For a surface layer, the vertical
effective stress becomes zero within the layer when the upward hydraulic
gradient is equal to the critical gradient.[14] At zero effective stress soil
has very little strength and layers of relatively impermeable soil may heave up
due to the underlying water pressures. The loss in strength due to upward
seepage is a common contributor to levee failures. The condition of zero
effective stress associated with upward seepage is also called liquefaction,
quicksand, or a boiling condition. Quicksand was so named because the soil
particles move around and appear to be 'alive' (the biblical meaning of 'quick'
â as opposed to 'dead'). (Note that it is not possible to be 'sucked down'
into quicksand. On the contrary, you would float with about half your body out
of the water.)[18]
***** Effective stress and capillarity: hydrostatic conditions[edit] *****
Spheres immersed in water, reducing effective stress.
Main article: Effective_stress
To understand the mechanics of soils it is necessary to understand how normal
stresses and shear stresses are shared by the different phases. Neither gas nor
liquid provide significant resistance to shear_stress. The shear resistance of
soil is provided by friction and interlocking of the particles. The friction
depends on the intergranular contact stresses between solid particles. The
normal stresses, on the other hand, are shared by the fluid and the particles.
Although the pore air is relatively compressible, and hence takes little normal
stress in most geotechnical problems, liquid water is relatively incompressible
and if the voids are saturated with water, the pore water must be squeezed out
in order to pack the particles closer together.
The principle of effective stress, introduced by Karl_Terzaghi, states that the
effective stress Ï' (i.e., the average intergranular stress between solid
particles) may be calculated by a simple subtraction of the pore pressure from
the total stress:
          &#x03C3; &#x2032;  = &#x03C3; &#x2212; u    {\displaystyle \sigma
      '=\sigma -u\,}  [\sigma' = \sigma - u\,]
where Ï is the total stress and u is the pore pressure. It is not practical to
measure Ï' directly, so in practice the vertical effective stress is
calculated from the pore pressure and vertical total stress. The distinction
between the terms pressure and stress is also important. By definition,
pressure at a point is equal in all directions but stresses at a point can be
different in different directions. In soil mechanics, compressive stresses and
pressures are considered to be positive and tensile stresses are considered to
be negative, which is different from the solid mechanics sign convention for
stress.
**** Total stress[edit] ****
For level ground conditions, the total vertical stress at a point,
&#x03C3;  v     {\displaystyle \sigma _{v}}  [\sigma_v], on average, is the
weight of everything above that point per unit area. The vertical stress
beneath a uniform surface layer with density     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho
}  [\rho ], and thickness     H   {\displaystyle H}  [H] is for example:
          &#x03C3;  v   = &#x03C1; g H = &#x03B3; H   {\displaystyle \sigma _
      {v}=\rho gH=\gamma H}  [\sigma_v = \rho g H = \gamma H]
where     g   {\displaystyle g}  [g] is the acceleration due to gravity, and
&#x03B3;   {\displaystyle \gamma }  [\gamma ] is the unit weight of the
overlying layer. If there are multiple layers of soil or water above the point
of interest, the vertical stress may be calculated by summing the product of
the unit weight and thickness of all of the overlying layers. Total stress
increases with increasing depth in proportion to the density of the overlying
soil.
It is not possible to calculate the horizontal total stress in this way.
Lateral_earth_pressures are addressed elsewhere.
**** Pore water pressure[edit] ****
Main article: Pore_water_pressure
*** Hydrostatic conditions[edit] ***
Water is drawn into a small tube by surface tension. Water pressure, u, is
negative above and positive below the free water surface
If there is no pore water flow occurring in the soil, the pore water pressures
will be hydrostatic. The water_table is located at the depth where the water
pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For hydrostatic conditions, the
water pressure increases linearly with depth below the water table:
         u =  &#x03C1;  w   g  z  w     {\displaystyle u=\rho _{w}gz_{w}}  [u =
      \rho_w g z_w ]
where      &#x03C1;  w     {\displaystyle \rho _{w}}  [\rho_w] is the density
of water, and      z  w     {\displaystyle z_{w}}  [z_w] is the depth below the
water table.
*** Capillary action[edit] ***
Due to surface tension, water will rise up in a small capillary tube above a
free surface of water. Likewise, water will rise up above the water table into
the small pore spaces around the soil particles. In fact the soil may be
completely saturated for some distance above the water table. Above the height
of capillary saturation, the soil may be wet but the water content will
decrease with elevation. If the water in the capillary zone is not moving, the
water pressure obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium,     u =  &#x03C1;
w   g  z  w     {\displaystyle u=\rho _{w}gz_{w}}  [u = \rho_w g z_w ], but
note that      z  w     {\displaystyle z_{w}}  [z_w ], is negative above the
water table. Hence, hydrostatic water pressures are negative above the water
table. The thickness of the zone of capillary saturation depends on the pore
size, but typically, the heights vary between a centimeter or so for coarse
sand to tens of meters for a silt or clay.[3] In fact the pore space of soil is
a uniform fractal e.g. a set of uniformly distributed D-dimensional fractals of
average linear size L. For the clay soil it has been found that L=0.15 mm and
D=2.7.[19]
The surface tension of water explains why the water does not drain out of a wet
sand castle or a moist ball of clay. Negative water pressures make the water
stick to the particles and pull the particles to each other, friction at the
particle contacts make a sand castle stable. But as soon as a wet sand castle
is submerged below a free water surface, the negative pressures are lost and
the castle collapses. Considering the effective stress equation,      &#x03C3;
&#x2032;  = &#x03C3; &#x2212; u ,   {\displaystyle \sigma '=\sigma -u,}
[\sigma' = \sigma - u,], if the water pressure is negative, the effective
stress may be positive, even on a free surface (a surface where the total
normal stress is zero). The negative pore pressure pulls the particles together
and causes compressive particle to particle contact forces. Negative pore
pressures in clayey soil can be much more powerful than those in sand. Negative
pore pressures explain why clay soils shrink when they dry and swell as they
are wetted. The swelling and shrinkage can cause major distress, especially to
light structures and roads.[14]
Later sections of this article address the pore water pressures for seepage and
consolidation problems.
    * Water at particle contacts
    * intergranular contact force due to surface tension
    * Shrinkage caused by drying
***** Consolidation: transient flow of water[edit] *****
Main article: Consolidation_(soil)
Consolidation analogy. The piston is supported by water underneath and a
spring. When a load is applied to the piston, water pressure increases to
support the load. As the water slowly leaks through the small hole, the load is
transferred from the water pressure to the spring force.
Consolidation is a process by which soils decrease in volume. It occurs when
stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together
more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is
saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required
to squeeze the water out of a thick deposit of clayey soil layer might be
years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out in a matter of
seconds. A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause
the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may
cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl_Terzaghi developed the
theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement
and the time required for the settlement to occur.[20] Soils are tested with an
oedometer_test to determine their compression index and coefficient of
consolidation.
When stress is removed from a consolidated soil, the soil will rebound, drawing
water back into the pores and regaining some of the volume it had lost in the
consolidation process. If the stress is reapplied, the soil will re-consolidate
again along a recompression curve, defined by the recompression index. Soil
that has been consolidated to a large pressure and has been subsequently
unloaded is considered to be overconsolidated. The maximum past vertical
effective stress is termed the preconsolidation stress. A soil which is
currently experiencing the maximum past vertical effective stress is said to be
normally consolidated. The overconsolidation ratio, (OCR) is the ratio of the
maximum past vertical effective stress to the current vertical effective
stress. The OCR is significant for two reasons: firstly, because the
compressibility of normally consolidated soil is significantly larger than that
for overconsolidated soil, and secondly, the shear behavior and dilatancy of
clayey soil are related to the OCR through critical_state_soil_mechanics;
highly overconsolidated clayey soils are dilatant, while normally consolidated
soils tend to be contractive.[2][3][4]
***** Shear behavior: stiffness and strength[edit] *****
Main article: shear_strength_(soil)
Typical stress strain curve for a drained dilatant soil
The shear strength and stiffness of soil determines whether or not soil will be
stable or how much it will deform. Knowledge of the strength is necessary to
determine if a slope will be stable, if a building or bridge might settle too
far into the ground, and the limiting pressures on a retaining wall. It is
important to distinguish between failure of a soil element and the failure of a
geotechnical structure (e.g., a building foundation, slope or retaining wall);
some soil elements may reach their peak strength prior to failure of the
structure. Different criteria can be used to define the "shear strength" and
the "yield point" for a soil element from a stressâstrain_curve. One may
define the peak shear strength as the peak of a stressâstrain curve, or the
shear strength at critical state as the value after large strains when the
shear resistance levels off. If the stressâstrain curve does not stabilize
before the end of shear strength test, the "strength" is sometimes considered
to be the shear resistance at 15â20% strain.[14] The shear strength of soil
depends on many factors including the effective_stress and the void ratio.
The shear stiffness is important, for example, for evaluation of the magnitude
of deformations of foundations and slopes prior to failure and because it is
related to the shear_wave velocity. The slope of the initial, nearly linear,
portion of a plot of shear stress as a function of shear strain is called the
shear_modulus
**** Friction, interlocking and dilation[edit] ****
Angle of repose
Soil is an assemblage of particles that have little to no cementation while
rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are
strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is
primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on
a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on that
plane.[3] The angle of internal friction is thus closely related to the maximum
stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose.
But in addition to friction, soil derives significant shear resistance from
interlocking of grains. If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend to
spread apart from each other as they are subject to shear strain. The expansion
of the particle matrix due to shearing was called dilatancy by Osborne
Reynolds.[10] If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of
particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and
there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a
distance, y.[10] Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate
against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength
than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they
become looser (their void ratio increases), and their rate of dilation
decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. Contractive soils become
denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach
a critical void ratio.
A critical state line separates the dilatant and contractive states for soil
The tendency for a soil to dilate or contract depends primarily on the
confining pressure and the void ratio of the soil. The rate of dilation is high
if the confining pressure is small and the void ratio is small. The rate of
contraction is high if the confining pressure is large and the void ratio is
large. As a first approximation, the regions of contraction and dilation are
separated by the critical state line.
**** Failure criteria[edit] ****
After a soil reaches the critical state, it is no longer contracting or
dilating and the shear stress on the failure plane      &#x03C4;  c r i t
{\displaystyle \tau _{crit}}  [ \tau_{crit}] is determined by the effective
normal stress on the failure plane      &#x03C3;  n  &#x2032;    {\displaystyle
\sigma _{n}'}  [ \sigma_n ' ] and critical state friction angle      &#x03D5;
c r i t  &#x2032;  &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \phi _{crit}'\ }  [  \phi_{crit} '\
]:
          &#x03C4;  c r i t   =  &#x03C3;  n  &#x2032;  tan &#x2061;  &#x03D5;
      c r i t  &#x2032;  &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \tau _{crit}=\sigma _{n}'\tan
      \phi _{crit}'\ }  [ \tau_{crit} = \sigma_n ' \tan \phi_{crit} '\ ]
The peak strength of the soil may be greater, however, due to the interlocking
(dilatancy) contribution. This may be stated:
          &#x03C4;  p e a k   =  &#x03C3;  n  &#x2032;  tan &#x2061;  &#x03D5;
      p e a k  &#x2032;  &#xA0;   {\displaystyle \tau _{peak}=\sigma _{n}'\tan
      \phi _{peak}'\ }  [ \tau_{peak} = \sigma_n ' \tan \phi_{peak} '\ ]
Where      &#x03D5;  p e a k  &#x2032;  >  &#x03D5;  c r i t  &#x2032;
{\displaystyle \phi _{peak}'>\phi _{crit}'}  [  \phi_{peak}' > \phi_{crit}' ].
However, use of a friction angle greater than the critical state value for
design requires care. The peak strength will not be mobilized everywhere at the
same time in a practical problem such as a foundation, slope or retaining wall.
The critical state friction angle is not nearly as variable as the peak
friction angle and hence it can be relied upon with confidence.[3][4][10]
Not recognizing the significance of dilatancy, Coulomb proposed that the shear
strength of soil may be expressed as a combination of adhesion and friction
components:[10]
          &#x03C4;  f   =  c &#x2032;  +  &#x03C3;  f  &#x2032;  tan &#x2061;
      &#x03D5; &#x2032;     {\displaystyle \tau _{f}=c'+\sigma _{f}'\tan \phi
      '\,}  [ \tau_f = c' + \sigma_f ' \tan \phi '\,]
It is now known that the      c &#x2032;    {\displaystyle c'}  [  c ' ] and
&#x03D5; &#x2032;    {\displaystyle \phi '}  [ \phi'] parameters in the last
equation are not fundamental soil properties.[3][6][10][21] In particular,
c &#x2032;    {\displaystyle c'}  [ c '] and      &#x03D5; &#x2032;
{\displaystyle \phi '}  [ \phi '] are different depending on the magnitude of
effective stress.[6][21] According to Schofield (2006),[10] the longstanding
use of      c &#x2032;    {\displaystyle c'}  [ c' ] in practice has led many
engineers to wrongly believe that      c &#x2032;    {\displaystyle c'}  [c']
is a fundamental parameter. This assumption that      c &#x2032;
{\displaystyle c'}  [ c '] and      &#x03D5; &#x2032;    {\displaystyle \phi '}
[ \phi '] are constant can lead to overestimation of peak strengths.[3][21]
**** Structure, fabric, and chemistry[edit] ****
In addition to the friction and interlocking (dilatancy) components of
strength, the structure and fabric also play a significant role in the soil
behavior. The structure and fabric include factors such as the spacing and
arrangement of the solid particles or the amount and spatial distribution of
pore water; in some cases cementitious material accumulates at particle-
particle contacts. Mechanical behavior of soil is affected by the density of
the particles and their structure or arrangement of the particles as well as
the amount and spatial distribution of fluids present (e.g., water and air
voids). Other factors include the electrical charge of the particles, chemistry
of pore water, chemical bonds (i.e. cementation -particles connected through a
solid substance such as recrystallized calcium carbonate) [1][21]
**** Drained and undrained shear[edit] ****
Foot pressure on sand causes it to dilate, drawing water from the surface into
the pores
The presence of nearly incompressible fluids such as water in the pore spaces
affects the ability for the pores to dilate or contract.
If the pores are saturated with water, water must be sucked into the dilating
pore spaces to fill the expanding pores (this phenomenon is visible at the
beach when apparently dry spots form around feet that press into the wet sand).
Similarly, for contractive soil, water must be squeezed out of the pore spaces
to allow contraction to take place.
Dilation of the voids causes negative water pressures that draw fluid into the
pores, and contraction of the voids causes positive pore pressures to push the
water out of the pores. If the rate of shearing is very large compared to the
rate that water can be sucked into or squeezed out of the dilating or
contracting pore spaces, then the shearing is called undrained shear, if the
shearing is slow enough that the water pressures are negligible, the shearing
is called drained shear. During undrained shear, the water pressure u changes
depending on volume change tendencies. From the effective stress equation, the
change in u directly effects the effective stress by the equation:
          &#x03C3; &#x2032;  = &#x03C3; &#x2212; u    {\displaystyle \sigma
      '=\sigma -u\,}  [\sigma' = \sigma - u\,]
and the strength is very sensitive to the effective stress. It follows then
that the undrained shear strength of a soil may be smaller or larger than the
drained shear strength depending upon whether the soil is contractive or
dilative.
**** Shear tests[edit] ****
Strength parameters can be measured in the laboratory using direct_shear_test,
triaxial_shear_test, simple_shear_test, fall_cone_test and (hand) shear_vane
test; there are numerous other devices and variations on these devices used in
practice today. Tests conducted to characterize the strength and stiffness of
the soils in the ground include the Cone_penetration_test and the Standard
penetration_test.
**** Other factors[edit] ****
The stressâstrain relationship of soils, and therefore the shearing strength,
is affected by:[22]
   1. soil composition (basic soil material): mineralogy, grain size and grain
      size distribution, shape of particles, pore fluid type and content, ions
      on grain and in pore fluid.
   2. state (initial): Define by the initial void_ratio, effective normal
      stress and shear stress (stress history). State can be describe by terms
      such as: loose, dense, overconsolidated, normally consolidated, stiff,
      soft, contractive, dilative, etc.
   3. structure: Refers to the arrangement of particles within the soil mass;
      the manner in which the particles are packed or distributed. Features
      such as layers, joints, fissures, slickensides, voids, pockets,
      cementation, etc., are part of the structure. Structure of soils is
      described by terms such as: undisturbed, disturbed, remolded, compacted,
      cemented; flocculent, honey-combed, single-grained; flocculated,
      deflocculated; stratified, layered, laminated; isotropic and anisotropic.
   4. Loading conditions: Effective stress_path -drained, undrained, and type
      of loading -magnitude, rate (static, dynamic), and time history
      (monotonic, cyclic).
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Lateral earth pressure[edit] ****
Main article: Lateral_earth_pressure
Lateral earth stress theory is used to estimate the amount of stress soil can
exert perpendicular to gravity. This is the stress exerted on retaining_walls.
A lateral earth stress coefficient, K, is defined as the ratio of lateral
(horizontal) effective stress to vertical effective stress for cohesionless
soils (K=Ï'h/Ï'v). There are three coefficients: at-rest, active, and
passive. At-rest stress is the lateral stress in the ground before any
disturbance takes place. The active stress state is reached when a wall moves
away from the soil under the influence of lateral stress, and results from
shear failure due to reduction of lateral stress. The passive stress state is
reached when a wall is pushed into the soil far enough to cause shear failure
within the mass due to increase of lateral stress. There are many theories for
estimating lateral earth stress; some are empirically based, and some are
analytically derived.
**** Bearing capacity[edit] ****
Main article: Bearing_capacity
The bearing capacity of soil is the average contact stress between a foundation
and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil. Allowable bearing
stress is the bearing capacity divided by a factor of safety. Sometimes, on
soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without
actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is
determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important
during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade
strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine
the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field
Plate Load Test is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure
characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of subgrade reaction (ks). The
Modulus of subgrade reaction (ks) is used in foundation design, soil-structure
interaction studies and design of highway pavements.[23]
**** Slope stability[edit] ****
Simple slope slip section
Main article: Slope_stability
The field of slope stability encompasses the analysis of static and dynamic
stability of slopes of earth and rock-fill dams, slopes of other types of
embankments, excavated slopes, and natural slopes in soil and soft rock.[24]
As seen to the right, earthen slopes can develop a cut-spherical weakness zone.
The probability of this happening can be calculated in advance using a simple
2-D circular analysis package...[25] A primary difficulty with analysis is
locating the most-probable slip plane for any given situation.[26] Many
landslides have been analyzed only after the fact.
***** Recent developments[edit] *****
A recent finding in soil mechanics is that soil deformation can be described as
the behavior of a dynamical_system. This approach to soil mechanics is referred
to as Dynamical Systems based Soil Mechanics (DSSM). DSSM holds simply that
soil deformation is a Poisson_process in which particles move to their final
position at random shear strains.
The basis of DSSM is that soils (including sands) can be sheared till they
reach a steady-state condition at which, under conditions of constant strain-
rate, there is no change in shear stress, effective confining stress, and void
ratio. The steady-state was formally defined[27] by Steve_J._Poulos an
Associate Professor at the Soil Mechanics Department of Harvard University, who
built off a hypothesis that Arthur Casagrande was formulating towards the end
of his career. The steady state condition is not the same as the "critical
state" condition.It differs from the critical state in that it specifies a
statistically constant structure at the steady state. The steady-state values
are also very slightly dependent on the strain-rate.
Many systems in nature reach steady-states and dynamical systems theory is used
to describe such systems. Soil shear can also be described as a dynamical
system.[28][29] The physical basis of the soil shear dynamical system is a
Poisson process in which particles move to the steady-state at random shear
strains.[30] Joseph[31] generalized thisâparticles move to their final
position (not just steady-state) at random shear-strains. Because of its
origins in the steady state concept DSSM is sometimes informally called
"Harvard soil mechanics."
DSSM provides for very close fits to stressâstrain curves, including for
sands. Because it tracks conditions on the failure plane, it also provides
close fits for the post failure region of sensitive clays and silts something
that other theories are not able to do. Additionally DSSM explains key
relationships in soil mechanics that to date have simply been taken for
granted, for example, why normalized undrained peak shear strengths vary with
the log of the over consolidation ratio and why stressâstrain curves
normalize with the initial effective confining stress; and why in one-
dimensional consolidation the void ratio must vary with the log of the
effective vertical stress, why the end-of-primary curve is unique for static
load increments, and why the ratio of the creep value CÎ± to the compression
index Cc must be approximately constant for a wide range of soils.[32]
