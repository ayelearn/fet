From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A cost estimate is the approximation of the cost of a program, project, or
operation. The cost estimate is the product of the cost estimating process. The
cost estimate has a single total value and may have identifiable component
values. A problem with a cost_overrun can be avoided with a credible, reliable,
and accurate cost estimate. A cost estimator is the professional who prepares
cost estimates. There are different types of cost estimators, whose title may
be preceded by a modifier, such as building_estimator, or electrical estimator,
or chief estimator. Other professionals such as quantity_surveyors and cost
engineers may also prepare cost estimates or contribute to cost estimates. In
the US, according to the Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics, there were 185,400 cost
estimators in 2010.[1] There are around 75,000 professional quantity surveyors
working in the UK.

***** Overview[edit] *****
The U.S. Government_Accountability_Office (GAO) defines a cost estimate as "the
summation of individual cost elements, using established methods and valid
data, to estimate the future costs of a program, based on what is known today".
The GAO reports that "realistic cost estimating was imperative when making wise
decisions in acquiring new systems."[2] A cost estimate is often needed to
support evaluations of project feasibility or funding requirements in support
of planning. A cost estimate is often used to establish a budget as the cost
constraint for a project or operation.
In project_management, project_cost_management is a major functional division.
Cost estimating is one of three activities performed in project cost
management.[3]
In cost_engineering, cost estimation is a basic activity. A cost engineering
reference book has chapters on capital investment cost estimation and operating
cost estimation. The fixed capital investment provides the physical facilities.
The working capital investment is a revolving fund to keep the facilities
operating.[4]
In system, product, or facility acquisition planning, a cost estimate is used
to evaluate the required funding and to compare with bids or tenders.
In construction contracting, a cost estimate is usually prepared to submit a
bid or tender to compete for a contract award.
In facility maintenance and operation, cost estimates are used to establish
funding or budgets.
In an attempt to manage liability risk, some firms avoid the use of the word
estimate and instead refer to the estimate as an "Opinion of Probable Cost."[5]
***** Cost estimate types[edit] *****
Various projects and operations have distinct types of cost estimating, which
vary in their composition and preparation methods. Some of the major areas
include:
    * Construction cost (i) detailed construction estimate (ii) abstract
      construction estimate
    * Manufacturing_cost
    * Software_development_cost
    * Aerospace mission cost
    * Resource exploration cost
    * Facility operation cost
    * Facility maintenance and repair cost
    * Facility rehabilitation and renewal cost
    * Facility retirement cost
***** Cost estimate classifications[edit] *****
Common cost estimate classifications historically used are
    * Order of magnitude
    * Preliminary
    * Definitive
These correspond to modern published classes 5, 3, and 1, respectively. The
U.S. Department of Energy and many others use a system of five classes of
estimates:
Estimate class Name               Purpose                Project definition
                                                         level
Class 5        Order of magnitude Screening or           0% to 2%
                                  feasibility
Class 4        Intermediate       Concept study or       1% to 15%
                                  feasibility
Class 3        Preliminary        Budget, authorization, 10% to 40%
                                  or control
Class 2        Substantive        Control or bid/tender  30% to 70%
Class 1        Definitive         Check estimate or bid/ 50% to 100%
                                  tender
Methods used to prepare the estimates range from stochastic or judgment at
early definition to deterministic at later definition. Some estimates use mixed
methods.[6]
Cost estimate classifications have been published by ASTM[7] and AACE
International.[8] The American Society of Professional Estimators (ASPE)
defines estimate levels in the reverse order as Level 1 â Order (Range) of
Magnitude, Level 2 â Schematic/Conceptual Design, Level 3- Design
Development, Level 4 â Construction Document, and Level 5 â Bid.>.â[9]
ACostE defines a Class I Estimate as definitive, a Class II Estimate as semi-
detailed, and a Class III Estimate as pre-budget.[10]
Other names for estimates of different classes include:
Class 1           Class 3                Class 5
Detailed estimate Semi-detailed estimate Conceptual estimate
Final estimate    Scope estimate         Pre-design estimate
Control estimate  Sanction estimate      Preliminary estimate
As-bid estimate                          Pre-budget estimate
As-sold estimate                         Evaluation estimate
CD estimate       DD estimate            SD estimate
                                         Parametric estimate

Estimate quality refers to the delineation of quality requirements for the
estimate. These requirements are set out in accordance with formal quality
assurance standards. There may also be other expectations for the estimate
which are not specific requirements, but may affect the perceived quality of
the estimate. Published quality requirements generally have to do with
credibility, accuracy, confidence level, precision, risk, reliability, and
validity of the estimate, as well as thoroughness, uniformity, consistency,
verification, and documentation.[11][12][13][14][15]
âThe result of bidding without good estimates is certain: jobs that end up
with less profit, no profit, or a loss. The bidder ultimately will go out of
business; the only question is how long will it take.â[16]
[ConeOfUncertainty.png]
Since a cost estimate is the approximation of the cost of a project or
operation, then estimate accuracy is a measure of how closely the estimate is
able to predict the actual expenditures for the project or operation. This can
only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project
estimate was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion
the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, the estimate was 6.8% too
high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an
unadjusted computation does not fairly assess the estimate accuracy.
Predictions of the estimate accuracy may accompany the estimate. Typically this
is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with the point estimate
with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range.[17]
An example for a definitive estimate might be that the estimate has a -5/+10%
range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that
range. The accuracy of an early estimate relates to the estimate quality.
Factors affecting the quality of the estimate include the people who prepared
the estimate, how the estimate was prepared, and what was known about the
project.[18] For the same project, the range of uncertainty about the total
estimate decreases over time, as illustrated in the cone of uncertainty
diagram.
High-quality cost estimates can be produced by following a rigor of 12 steps
[19] outlined by the U.S. GAO. Detailed documentation is recommended to
accompany the estimate. âThe documentation addresses the purpose of the
estimate, the program background and system description, its schedule, the
scope of the estimate (in terms of time and what is and is not included), the
ground rules and assumptions, all data sources, estimating methodology and
rationale, the results of the risk analysis, and a conclusion about whether the
cost estimate is reasonable. Therefore, a good cost estimateâwhile taking the
form of a single numberâis supported by detailed documentation that describes
how it was derived and how the expected funding will be spent in order to
achieve a given objective.â[20] This documentation is often titled Basis of
Estimate (or BOE). Additional documentation may accompany the estimate,
including quantity takeoff documentation and supporting calculations, quotes,
etc.
Although the pursuit of cost estimate accuracy should always be encouraged, a
study in 2002 found that the estimates used to determine whether important
infrastructure should be built were "highly and systematically misleading."[21]
***** Contingency[edit] *****
A contingency may be included in an estimate to provide for unknown costs which
are indicated as likely to occur by experience, but are not identifiable. When
using an estimate which has no contingency to set a budget or to set aside
funding, a contingency is often added to improve the probability that the
budget or funding will be adequate to complete the project. See cost
contingency for more information. The estimate or budget contingency is not
intended to compensate for poor estimate quality, and is not intended to fund
design growth, owner changes, or anything else unrelated to delivering the
scope as defined in the estimate documentation. Generally more contingency is
needed for earlier estimates due to the higher uncertainty of estimate
accuracy.18
***** Cost estimating methods and best practices[edit] *****
Estimating methods may vary by type and class of estimate. The method used for
most definitive estimates is to fully define and understand the scope, take off
or quantify the scope, and apply costing to the scope, which can then be summed
to a total cost. Proper documentation and review are also important. Pricing
transforms the cost estimate into what the firm wishes to charge for the scope.
Early estimates may employ various means of cost modeling. The basic
characteristics of effective estimating include: clear identification of task,
broad participation in preparing estimates, availability of valid data,
standardized structure for the estimate, provision for program uncertainties,
recognition of inflation, recognition of excluded costs, independent review of
estimates, and revision of estimates for significant program changes.[22]
Application of best_practices helps ensure a high-quality estimate. âCertain
best practices should be followed if accurate and credible cost estimates are
to be developed. These best practices represent an overall process of
established, repeatable methods that result in high-quality cost estimates that
are comprehensive and accurate and that can be easily and clearly traced,
replicated, and updated.â[23]
Tools that may be part of costs estimation are cost indexes. These factors
promote time adjustment of capital costs, following changes in technology,
availability of materials and labor, and inflation.[24] Due to the inherent
unavailability of up-to-date cost literature, several inflation or cost indexes
are available.[25]
**** Construction cost estimates[edit] ****
Estimates for the cost of facility construction are a major part of the cost
estimate domain. A construction general_contractor or subcontractor must
normally prepare definitive cost estimates to prepare bids in the construction
bidding process to compete for award of the contract. Although many estimators
participate in the bidding and procurement processes, those are not a necessary
function of cost estimate preparation. Earlier estimates are prepared by
differing methods by estimators and others to support the planning process and
to compare with bids. One way to make those estimates is by determining the
resources needed (e.g., the amount of construction material quantities that are
required) and then multiplying the estimated construction material quantities
by the corresponding unit cost. One advantage of making estimates in this way
is that it allows for the segregation of quantities and costs. This way they
can be updated separately as new information becomes available. They can also
be tracked separately allowing decision makers to make better decisions about
the project during its conceptual phase.[26]
*** Definitive Estimates (Class 1)[edit] ***
A handwritten spreadsheet.
A definitive estimate is prepared from fully designed plans and specifications
(or nearly so), preferably what are called contract documents (CD). The
contract documents also establish the Scope of Work (SOW). The standard method
is to review and understand the design package and take off (or perform a
quantity survey of) the project scope by itemizing it into line_items with
measured quantities. RSMeans refers to this as, "Scope out the project," and,
"Quantify."[27] Some jurisdictions or areas of practice define the itemization
and measuring in certain terms, such as RICS and may have specific rules for
development of a bill_of_quantities. The ASPE proposes a best practice standard
method for the quantity survey. This includes using the Construction
Specifications_Institute Uniform Numbering System (MasterFormat) to ensure that
all work is accounted for.[28]
Then costs are applied to the quantified line items. This may be called costing
or pricing. In estimating for contracting, the cost is what something costs you
to build, and price is what you charge another party for building it. RSMeans
refers to this as, "Price the quantities."[29] ASPE recommends the "quantity
times material and labor costs format"[30] for the compilation of the estimate.
This format is illustrated in the handwritten spreadsheet sample. For labor,
the estimator should, "Determine basic production rates and multiply them by
the units of work to determine total hours for the work."[31] and then multiply
the hours by the per hour average labor cost.[32] Labor burdens, material
costs, construction equipment costs, and, if applicable, subcontractor costs
are also extended on the estimate detail form.[33] Other costs and pricing are
added, such as overhead, profit, sales or use taxes, payment and performance
bonds, escalation, and contingency.[34]
The costs which are applied to the line-item quantities may come from a cost
book (either internal or external) or cost_database. For construction
contractors or construction managers it is important to track and compile past
data of trends, completed projects, production factors, equipment changes, and
various labor markets.[35]
Sample labor norms
The labor requirements are often the most variable and are a primary focus of
construction cost estimators. The labor hours required to construct each
installation item are calculated by using a man-hour rate times the take-off
quantity (a similar method is to divide the take-off quantity by the production
rate). Many estimators use a man-hour norm reference for standard man-hours and
apply an adjustment factor for project or task conditions, location, methods,
equipment, labor skill, etc. to adjust for the anticipated effect on labor.
Direct costs are itemized for all necessary parts of the project. Direct_costs
are all of the costs which can be attributed directly to the project. Direct
costs include costs for general requirements (Division 1 of MasterFormat),
which includes such items as project_management and coordination, quality
control, temporary facilities and controls, cleaning and waste_management.[36]
Direct costs may also include the costs of project planning, investigation,
studies, and design; land or right of way acquisition, and other non-
construction costs. Usually, a subtotal of total direct costs is provided in
the estimate.
Provisions are made for Indirect_costs in addition to the direct costs.
Indirect costs include overhead, profit, sales or use taxes, payment and
performance_bonds, escalation, and contingency. Profit is cost to the buyer,
but is not a cost to the provider, rather a projection of anticipated income.
A well documented cost estimate includes a Basis of Estimate (BOE), which
describes the scope basis, pricing basis, methods, assumptions, inclusions, and
exclusions.
*** Order-of-Magnitude Estimates (Class 5)[edit] ***
An order-of-magnitude estimate is prepared when little or no design information
is available for the project. It is called order of magnitude because that may
be all that can be determined at an early stage. In other words, perhaps we can
only determine that it is of a 10,000,000 magnitude as opposed to a 1,000,000
magnitude. Various techniques are employed for these estimates, including
experience and judgment, historical values and charts, rules of thumb, and
simple mathematical calculations.[37] Factor estimating is one of the more
popular methods. This involves taking the known cost of a similar facility and
factoring the cost for size,[38] place, and time. Cost modeling is another
common technique. In cost modeling the estimator models the various parameters
of the facility and applies costs to the derived scope.
Building estimators or architects may use the Uniformat system of breaking down
the building into functional systems or assemblies during the schematic design
(SD) phase of planning and design.[39] The RSMeans Square Foot Costs book
organizes building costs according to the 7 divisions of the UNIFORMAT II
classification system.[40] The 7 divisions are:
    * A Substructure
    * B Shell
    * C Interiors
    * D Services
    * E Equipment & Furnishings
    * F Special Construction
    * G Building Site Work
