Construction management (CM) is a professional service that uses specialized,
project_management techniques to oversee the planning, design, and construction
of a project, from its beginning to its end. The purpose of CM is to control a
project's time / delivery, cost and qualityâsometimes referred to as a
project_management_triangle or "triple constraints."[1] CM is compatible with
all project_delivery_systems, including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-
Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be
reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings (commercial_real
estate, transportation_infrastructure, industrial facilities, and military
infrastructure), called capital projects.

***** The role of a contractor[edit] *****
Contractors are assigned to a construction project during the design or once
the design has been completed by a licensed architect or a licensed civil
engineer. This is done by going through a bidding process with different
contractors. The contractor is selected by using one of three common selection
methods: low-bid selection, best-value selection, or qualifications-based
selection.
A construction manager should have the ability to handle public_safety, time
management, cost_management, quality_management, decision_making, mathematics,
working_drawings, and human_resources.[2]
***** Function[edit] *****
The functions of construction management typically include the following:
   1. Specifying project objectives and plans including delineation of scope,
      budgeting, scheduling, setting performance requirements, and selecting
      project participants.
   2. Maximizing the resource efficiency through procurement of labor,
      materials and equipment.
   3. Implementing various operations through proper coordination and control
      of planning, design, estimating, contracting and construction in the
      entire process.
   4. Developing effective communications and mechanisms for resolving
      conflicts.[3]
The Construction_Management_Association_of_America (CMAA) states the most
common responsibilities of a Construction Manager fall into the following 7
categories: Project Management Planning, Cost Management, Time Management,
Quality Management, Contract Administration, Safety Management, and CM
Professional Practice. CM professional practice includes specific activities,
such as defining the responsibilities and management structure of the project
management team, organizing and leading by implementing project controls,
defining roles and responsibilities, developing communication protocols, and
identifying elements of project design and construction likely to give rise to
disputes and claims.[4]
***** Seven types of construction[edit] *****
    * Agricultural: Typically economical buildings, and other improvements, for
      agricultural purposes. Examples include barns, equipment and animal
      sheds, specialized fencing, storage silos and elevators, and water supply
      and drains such as wells, tanks, and ditches.
    * Residential: Residential construction includes houses, apartments,
      townhouses, and other smaller, low-rise housing, small office types.[2]
    * Commercial: This refers to construction for the needs of private
      commerce, trade, and services. Examples include office buildings, "big
      box" stores, shopping centers and malls, warehouses, banks, theaters,
      casinos, resorts, golf courses, and larger residential structures such as
      high-rise hotels and condominiums.
    * Institutional: This category is for the needs of government and other
      public organizations. Examples include schools, fire and police stations,
      libraries, museums, dormitories, research buildings, hospitals,
      transportation terminals, some military facilities, and governmental
      buildings.
    * Industrial: Buildings and other constructed items used for storage and
      product production, including chemical and power plants, steel mills, oil
      refineries and platforms, manufacturing plants, pipelines, and seaports.
    * Heavy civil: The construction of transportation infrastructure such as
      roads, bridges, railroads, tunnels, airports, and fortified military
      facilities.[2] Dams are also included, but most other water-related
      infrastructure is considered environmental.
    * Environmental: Environmental construction was part of heavy civil, but is
      now separate, dealing with projects that improve the environment. Some
      examples are water and wastewater treatment plants, sanitary and storm
      sewers, solid waste management, and air pollution control.[2]
***** Obtaining the project[edit] *****
**** Bids[edit] ****
A bid is given to the owner by construction managers that are willing to
complete their construction project. A bid tells the owner how much money they
should expect to pay the construction management company in order for them to
complete the project.[2]
    * Open bid: An open bid is used for public projects. Any and all
      contractors are allowed to submit their bid due to public advertising.
    * Closed bid: A closed bid is used for private projects. A selection of
      contractors are sent an invitation for bid so only they can submit a bid
      for the specified project.[2]
**** Selection methods[edit] ****
    * Low-bid selection: This selection focuses on the price of a project.
      Multiple construction management companies submit a bid to the owner that
      is the lowest amount they are willing to do the job for. Then the owner
      usually chooses the company with the lowest bid to complete the job for
      them.[2]
    * Best-value selection: This selection focuses on both the price and
      qualifications of the contractors submitting bids. This means that the
      owner chooses the contractor with the best price and the best
      qualifications. The owner decides by using a request for proposal (RFP),
      which provides the owner with the contractor's exact form of scheduling
      and budgeting that the contractor expects to use for the project.[2]
    * Qualifications-based selection: This selection is used when the owner
      decides to choose the contractor only on the basis of their
      qualifications. The owner then uses a request for qualifications (RFQ),
      which provides the owner with the contractor's experience, management
      plans, project organization, and budget and schedule performance. The
      owner may also ask for safety records and individual credentials of their
      members.[2] This method is most often used when the contractor is hired
      early during the design process so that the contractor can provide input
      and cost estimates as the design develops.
**** Payment contracts[edit] ****
    * Lump sum: This is the most common type of contract. The construction
      manager and the owner agree on the overall cost of the construction
      project and the owner is responsible for paying that amount whether the
      construction project exceeds or falls below the agreed price of payment.
      [2]
    * Cost plus fee: This contract provides payment for the contractor
      including the total cost of the project as well as a fixed fee or
      percentage of the total cost. This contract is beneficial to the
      contractor since any additional costs will be paid for, even though they
      were unexpected for the owner.[2]
    * Guaranteed maximum price: This contract is the same as the cost-plus-fee
      contract although there is a set price that the overall cost and fee do
      not go above.[2]
    * Unitprice: This contract is used when the cost cannot be determined ahead
      of time. The owner provides materials with a specific unit price to limit
      spending.[2]
***** Project stages[edit] *****
Characteristics of construction project stages of various project management
approaches[5]
The stages of a typical construction project have been defined as feasibility,
design, construction and operation,[5] each stage relating to the project life
cycle.
**** Feasibility and design[edit] ****
Feasibility and design involves four steps: programming and feasibility,
schematic design, design development, and contract documents. It is the
responsibility of the design team to ensure that the design meets all building
codes and regulations. It is during the design stage that the bidding process
takes place.[2]
    * Conceptual/Programming and feasibility: The needs, goals, and objectives
      must be determined for the building. Decisions must be made on the
      building size, number of rooms, how the space will be used, and who will
      be using the space. This must all be considered to begin the actual
      designing of the building. This phase is normally a written list of each
      room or space, the critical information about those spaces, and the
      approximate square footage of each area.
    * Schematic design: Schematic designs are sketches used to identify spaces,
      shapes, and patterns. Materials, sizes, colors, and textures must be
      considered in the sketches.[2] This phase usually involves developing the
      floor plan, elevations, a site plan, and possibly a few details.
    * Design development (DD): This step requires research and investigation
      into what materials and equipment will be used as well as their cost.
      During this phase, the drawings are refined with information from
      structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineers. It also
      involves a more rigorous evaluation how the applicable building codes
      will impact the project.
    * Contract documents (CDs): Contract documents are the final drawings and
      specifications of the construction project. They are used by contractors
      to determine their bid while builders use them for the construction
      process. Contract documents can also be called working drawings.[2]
**** Pre-construction[edit] ****
The pre-construction stage begins when the owner gives a notice to proceed to
the contractor that they have chosen through the bidding process. A notice to
proceed is when the owner gives permission to the contractor to begin their
work on the project. The first step is to assign the project team which
includes the project manager (PM), contract administrator, superintendent, and
field engineer.[2]
    * Project manager: The project manager is in charge of the project team.
    * Contract administrator: The contract administrator assists the project
      manager as well as the superintendent with the details of the
      construction contract.
    * Superintendent: It is the superintendent's job to make sure everything is
      on schedule including flow of materials, deliveries, and equipment. They
      are also in charge of coordinating on-site construction activities.[2]
    * Field engineer: A field engineer is considered an entry-level position
      and is responsible for paperwork.
During the pre-construction stage, a site investigation must take place. A site
investigation takes place to discover if any steps need to be implemented on
the job site. This is in order to get the site ready before the actual
construction begins. This also includes any unforeseen conditions such as
historical artifacts or environment problems. A soil test must be done to
determine if the soil is in good condition to be built upon.[2]
**** Procurement[edit] ****
The procurement stage is when labor, materials and equipment needed to complete
the project are purchased. This can be done by the general contractor if the
company does all their own construction work. If the contractor does not do
their own work, they obtain it through subcontractors. Subcontractors are
contractors who specialize in one particular aspect of the construction work
such as concrete, welding, glass, or carpentry. Subcontractors are hired the
same way a general contractor would be, which is through the bidding process.
Purchase orders are also part of the procurement stage.[2]
    * Purchase orders: A purchase order is used in various types of businesses.
      In this case, a purchase order is an agreement between a buyer and seller
      that the products purchased meet the required specifications for the
      agreed price.[2]
**** Construction[edit] ****
The construction stage begins with a pre-construction meeting brought together
by the superintendent (on an American project). The pre-construction meeting is
meant to make decisions dealing with work hours, material storage, quality
control, and site access. The next step is to move everything onto the
construction site and set it all up.[2]
A Contractor progress payment schedule is a schedule of when (according to
project milestones or specified dates) contractors and suppliers will be paid
for the current progress of installed work.
Progress payments are partial payments for work completed during a portion,
usually a month, during a construction period. Progress payments are made to
general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers as construction projects
progress. Payments are typically made on a monthly basis but could be modified
to meet certain milestones. Progress payments are an important part of contract
administration for the contractor. Proper preparation of the information
necessary for payment processing can help the contractor financially complete
the project. [6]
**** Owner occupancy[edit] ****
Once the owner moves into the building, a warranty period begins. This is to
ensure that all materials, equipment, and quality meet the expectations of the
owner that are included within the contract.[2]
***** Issues resulting from construction[edit] *****
**** Dust and mud[edit] ****
When construction vehicles are driving around a site or moving earth, a lot of
dust is created, especially during the dryer months. This may cause disruption
for surrounding businesses or homes. A popular method of dust control is to
have a water truck driving through the site spraying water on the dry dirt to
minimize the movement of dust within and out of the construction site. When
water is introduced mud is created. This mud sticks to the tires of the
construction vehicles and is often lead out to the surrounding roads. A street
sweeper may clean the roads to reduce dirty road conditions.
**** Environmental protections[edit] ****
    * Storm water_pollution: As a result of construction, the soil is displaced
      from its original location which can possibly cause environmental
      problems in the future. Runoff can occur during storms which can possibly
      transfer harmful pollutants through the soil to rivers, lakes, wetlands,
      and coastal waters.
    * Endangered species: If endangered species have been found on the
      construction site, the site must be shut down for some time. The
      construction site must be shut down for as long as it takes for
      authorities to make a decision on the situation. Once the situation has
      been assessed, the contractor makes the appropriate accommodations to not
      disturb the species.
    * Vegetation: There may often be particular trees or other vegetation that
      must be protected on the job site. This may require fences or security
      tape to warn builders that they must not be harmed.
    * Wetlands: The contractor must make accommodations so that erosion and
      water flow are not affected by construction. Any liquid spills must be
      maintained due to contaminants that may enter the wetland.
    * Historical or cultural_artifacts: Artifacts may include arrowheads,
      pottery shards, and bones. All work comes to a halt if any artifacts are
      found and will not resume until they can be properly examined and removed
      from the area.[2]
***** Construction activity documentation[edit] *****
Project meetings take place at scheduled intervals to discuss the progress on
the construction site and any concerns or issues. The discussion and any
decisions made at the meeting must be documented.[2]
Diaries, logs, and daily field reports keep track of the daily activities on a
job site each day.
    * Diaries: Each member of the project team is expected to keep a project
      diary. The diary contains summaries of the day's events in the member's
      own words. They are used to keep track of any daily work activity,
      conversations, observations, or any other relevant information regarding
      the construction activities. Diaries can be referred to when disputes
      arise and a diary happens to contain information connected with the
      disagreement. Diaries that are handwritten can be used as evidence in
      court.
    * Logs: Logs keep track of the regular activities on the job site such as
      phone logs, transmittal logs, delivery logs, and RFI (Request for
      Information) logs.
    * Daily field reports: Daily field reports are a more formal way of
      recording information on the job site. They contain information that
      includes the day's activities, temperature and weather conditions,
      delivered equipment or materials, visitors on the site, and equipment
      used that day.[2]
Labor statements are required on a daily basis. Also list of Labor, PERT CPM
are needed for labor planning to complete a project in time.
***** Resolving disputes[edit] *****
    * Mediation: Mediation uses a third party mediator to resolve any disputes.
      The mediator helps both disputing parties to come to a mutual agreement.
      This process ensures that no attorneys become involved in the dispute and
      is less time-consuming.
    * Minitrial: A minitrial takes more time and money than a mediation. The
      minitrial takes place in an informal setting and involves some type of
      advisor or attorney that must be paid. The disputing parties may come to
      an agreement or the third party advisor may offer their advice. The
      agreement is nonbinding and can be broken.
    * Arbitration: Arbitration is the most costly and time-consuming way to
      resolve a dispute. Each party is represented by an attorney while
      witnesses and evidence are presented. Once all information is provided on
      the issue, the arbitrator makes a ruling which provides the final
      decision. The arbitrator provides the final decision on what must be done
      and it is a binding agreement between each of the disputing parties.[2]
***** Study and practice[edit] *****
Construction Management education comes in a variety of formats: formal degree
programs (Two-year associate_degree; four-year baccalaureate_degree, masters
degree, project_management, operations_management engineer_degree, doctor_of
philosophy degree, postdoctoral_researcher); on-the-job-training; and
continuing education and professional development. Information on degree
programs is available from ABET, the American Council for Construction
Education (ACCE), the Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) or
the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC).
According to the American Council for Construction Education (one of the
academic accreditation agencies responsible for accrediting construction
management programs in the U.S.), the academic field of construction management
encompasses a wide range of topics. These range from general management skills,
through management skills specifically related to construction, to technical
knowledge of construction methods and practices. There are many schools
offering Construction Management programs, including some offering a master's
degree.[7][8]
***** Software[edit] *****
Capital project management software (CPMS) refers to the systems that are
currently available that help capital project owner/operators, program
managers, and construction managers, control and manage the vast amount of
information that capital construction projects create. A collection, or
portfolio of projects only makes this a bigger challenge. These systems go by
different names: capital project management software, computer construction
software, construction management software, project management information
systems. Usually Construction Management can be referred as subset of CPMS
where the scope of CPMS is not limited to construction phases of project. Among
main construction management software can be mentioned Procore and PlanGrid.

The construction industry typically includes three parties: an owner, a
licensed designer (architect or engineer) and a builder (usually known as a
general_contractor). There are traditionally two contracts between these
parties as they work together to plan, design and construct the project.[9] The
first contract is the owner-designer contract, which involves planning, design,
and construction contract administration. The second contract is the owner-
contractor contract, which involves construction. An indirect third-party
relationship exists between the designer and the contractor, due to these two
contracts.
An owner may also contract with a construction project management company as an
adviser, creating a third contract relationship in the project. The
construction manager's role is to provide construction advice to the designer,
design advice to the constructor on the owner's behalf and other advice as
necessary.
**** Design, bid, build contracts[edit] ****
Main article: Designâbidâbuild
The phrase "design, bid, build" describes the prevailing model of construction
management, in which the general contractor is engaged through a tender process
after designs have been completed by the architect or engineer.
**** Design-build contracts[edit] ****
Main article: Designâbuild
Many owners â particularly government agencies â let out contracts known as
design-build contracts. In this type of contract, the construction team (known
as the design-builder) is responsible for taking the owner's concept and
completing a detailed design before (following the owner's approval of the
design) proceeding with construction. Virtual_design_and_construction
technology may be used by contractors to maintain a tight construction time.
There are three main advantages to a design-build contract. First, the
construction team is motivated to work with the architect to develop a
practical design. The team can find creative ways to reduce construction costs
without reducing the function of the final product. The second major advantage
involves the schedule. Many projects are commissioned within a tight time
frame. Under a traditional contract, construction cannot begin until after the
design is finished and the project has been awarded to a bidder. In a design-
build contract the contractor is established at the outset, and construction
activities can proceed concurrently with the design. The third major advantage
is that the design-build contractor has an incentive to keep the combined
design and construction costs within the owner's budget. If speed is important,
design and construction contracts can be awarded separately; bidding takes
place on preliminary plans in a not-to-exceed contract instead of a single firm
design-build contract.
The major problem[10] with design-build contracts is an inherent conflict of
interest. In a standard contract the architect works for the owner and is
directly responsible to the owner. In design-build the architect works for the
design-builder, not the owner, therefor the design-builder may make design and
construction decisions that benefit the design-builder, but that do not benefit
the owner. During construction, the architect normally acts as the owner's
representative. This includes reviewing the builder's work and ensuring that
the products and methods meet specifications and codes. The architect's role is
compromised when the architect works for the design-builder and not for the
owner directly. Thus, the owner may get a building that is over-designed to
increase profits for the design-builder, or a building built with lesser-
quality products to maximize profits.
**** Planning and scheduling[edit] ****
Project-management methodology is as follows:
    * Work breakdown structure
    * Project network of activities
          o Critical_path_method (CPM)
          o Resource management
          o Resource leveling
          o Risk assessment
**** Architectureâengineer[edit] ****
    * Work inspection
    * Change orders
    * Review payments
    * Materials and samples
    * Shop drawings
    * Three-dimensional image
**** Agency CM[edit] ****
Construction cost management is a fee-based service in which the construction
manager (CM) is responsible exclusively to the owner, acting in the owner's
interests at every stage of the project. The construction manager offers
impartial advice on matters such as:
    * Optimum use of available funds
    * Control of the scope of the work
    * Project scheduling
    * Optimum use of design and construction firms' skills and talents
    * Avoidance of delays, changes and disputes
    * Enhancing project design and construction quality
    * Optimum flexibility in contracting and procurement
    * Cash-flow management
Comprehensive management of every stage of the project, beginning with the
original concept and project definition, yields the greatest benefit to owners.
As time progresses beyond the pre-design phase, the CM's ability to effect cost
savings diminishes. The agency CM can represent the owner by helping select the
design and construction teams and managing the design (preventing scope_creep),
helping the owner stay within a predetermined budget with value engineering,
cost-benefit analysis and best-value comparisons. The software-application
field of construction_collaboration_technology has been developed to apply
information technology to construction management.
**** CM at-risk[edit] ****
CM at-risk is a delivery method which entails a commitment by the construction
manager to deliver the project within a Guaranteed_Maximum_Price (GMP). The
construction manager acts as a consultant to the owner in the development and
design phases (preconstruction services), and as a general contractor during
construction. When a construction manager is bound to a GMP, the fundamental
character of the relationship is changed. In addition to acting in the owner's
interest, the construction manager must control construction costs to stay
within the GMP.
CM at-risk is a global term referring to the business relationship of a
construction contractor, owner and architect (or designer). Typically, a CM at-
risk arrangement eliminates a "low-bid" construction project. A GMP agreement
is a typical part of the CM-and-owner agreement (comparable to a "low-bid"
contract), but with adjustments in responsibility for the CM. The advantage of
a CM at-risk arrangement is budget management. Before a project's design is
completed (six to eighteen months of coordination between designer and owner),
the CM is involved with estimating the cost of constructing a project based on
the goals of the designer and owner (design concept) and the project's scope.
In balancing the costs, schedule, quality and scope of the project, the design
may be modified instead of redesigned; if the owner decides to expand the
project, adjustments can be made before pricing. To manage the budget before
design is complete and construction crews mobilized, the CM conducts site
management and purchases major items to efficiently manage time and cost.[11]
*** Advantages[edit] ***
    * CM is working "at risk", therefore have incentive to act in the owner's
      interest, as well as to efficiently manage construction costs,
      considering they would be liable for any amount in excess of the GMP
    * Ability to handle changes in design or scope[12]
*** Drawbacks[edit] ***
    * If a cost overrun occurred, it could cost the CM a great deal of money
    * The CM is allowed some mistake-related contingency, therefore there is a
      possibility that they will compensate by reducing the scope of the work
      to fit the GMP
    * Since the GMP is settled before design begins, it is difficult for owners
      to know whether they received the best possible bid[11]
*** Bottom line[edit] ***
An at-risk delivery method is best for large projectsâboth complete
construction and renovationâthat are not easy to define, have a possibility
of changing in scope, or have strict schedule deadlines. Additionally, it is an
efficient method in projects containing technical complexity, multi-trade
coordination, or multiple phases.[12]
**** Accelerated construction techniques[edit] ****
Starting with its Accelerated Bridge Program in the late 2000s, the
Massachusetts_Department_of_Transportation began employing accelerated
construction techniques, in which it signs contracts with incentives for early
completion and penalties for late completion, and uses intense construction
during longer periods of complete closure to shorten the overall project
