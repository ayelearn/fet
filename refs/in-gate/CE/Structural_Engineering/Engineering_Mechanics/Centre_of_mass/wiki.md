This toy uses the principles of center of mass to keep balance on a finger
In physics, the center of mass of a distribution of mass in space is the unique
point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to
zero. This is the point to which a force may be applied to cause a linear
acceleration without an angular_acceleration. Calculations in mechanics are
often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass. It is a
hypothetical point where entire mass of an object may be assumed to be
concentrated to visualise its motion. In other words, the center of mass is the
particle equivalent of a given object for application of Newton's_laws_of
motion.
In the case of a single rigid_body, the center of mass is fixed in relation to
the body, and if the body has uniform density, it will be located at the
centroid. The center of mass may be located outside the physical body, as is
sometimes the case for hollow or open-shaped objects, such as a horseshoe. In
the case of a distribution of separate bodies, such as the planets of the Solar
System, the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual
member of the system.
The center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in mechanics
that involve masses distributed in space, such as the linear and angular
momentum of planetary bodies and rigid_body_dynamics. In orbital_mechanics, the
equations of motion of planets are formulated as point_masses located at the
centers of mass. The center_of_mass_frame is an inertial_frame in which the
center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the
coordinate system.

***** History[edit] *****
The concept of "center of mass" in the form of the center of gravity was first
introduced by the great ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer
Archimedes_of_Syracuse. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity
that amount to a uniform field, thus arriving at the mathematical properties of
what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the torque exerted
on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as
what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single pointâtheir
center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation
of a floating object is the one that makes its center of mass as low as
possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass
of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes.[1]
Later mathematicians who developed the theory of the center of mass include
Pappus_of_Alexandria, Guido_Ubaldi, Francesco_Maurolico,[2] Federico
Commandino,[3] Simon_Stevin,[4] Luca_Valerio,[5] Jean-Charles_de_la_Faille,
Paul_Guldin,[6] John_Wallis, Louis_CarrÃ©, Pierre_Varignon, and Alexis
Clairaut.[7]
Newton's_second_law is reformulated with respect to the center of mass in
Euler's_first_law.[8]

***** Definition[edit] *****
The center of mass is the unique point at the center of a distribution of mass
in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to
this point sum to zero. In analogy to statistics, the center of mass is the
mean location of a distribution of mass in space.
**** A system of particles[edit] ****
In the case of a system of particles Pi, i = 1,ââ¦,ânâ, each with mass
mi that are located in space with coordinates ri, i = 1,ââ¦,ânâ, the
coordinates R of the center of mass satisfy the condition
          &#x2211;  i = 1   n    m  i   (   r   i   &#x2212;  R  ) = 0.
      {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )=0.}
      [\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )=0.]
Solving this equation for R yields the formula
          R  =   1 M    &#x2211;  i = 1   n    m  i     r   i   ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ={\frac {1}{M}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\mathbf {r}
      _{i},}  [\mathbf {R} ={\frac {1}{M}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\mathbf {r} _
      {i},]
where M is the sum of the masses of all of the particles.
**** A continuous volume[edit] ****
If the mass distribution is continuous with the density Ï(r) within a solid Q,
then the integral of the weighted position coordinates of the points in this
volume relative to the center of mass R over the volume V is zero, that is
          &#x222D;  Q   &#x03C1; (  r  ) (  r  &#x2212;  R  ) d V = 0.
      {\displaystyle \iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )(\mathbf {r} -
      \mathbf {R} )dV=0.}  [{\displaystyle \iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r}
      )(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {R} )dV=0.}]
Solve this equation for the coordinates R to obtain
          R  =   1 M    &#x222D;  Q   &#x03C1; (  r  )  r  d V ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ={\frac {1}{M}}\iiint \limits _{Q}\rho
      (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {r} dV,}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ={\frac {1}
      {M}}\iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {r} dV,}]
where M is the total mass in the volume.
If a continuous mass distribution has uniform density, which means Ï is
constant, then the center of mass is the same as the centroid of the volume.[9]
**** Barycentric coordinates[edit] ****
Further information: Barycentric_coordinate_system
The coordinates R of the center of mass of a two-particle system, P1 and P2,
with masses m1 and m2 is given by
          R  =   1   m  1   +  m  2      (  m  1     r   1   +  m  2     r   2
      ) .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ={\frac {1}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}(m_{1}\mathbf
      {r} _{1}+m_{2}\mathbf {r} _{2}).}  [\mathbf {R} ={\frac {1}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}
      (m_{1}\mathbf {r} _{1}+m_{2}\mathbf {r} _{2}).]
Let the percentage of the total mass divided between these two particles vary
from 100% P1 and 0% P2 through 50% P1 and 50% P2 to 0% P1 and 100% P2, then the
center of mass R moves along the line from P1 to P2. The percentages of mass at
each point can be viewed as projective coordinates of the point R on this line,
and are termed barycentric coordinates. Another way of interpreting the process
here is the mechanical balancing of moments about an arbitrary point. The
numerator gives the total moment that is then balanced by an equivalent total
force at the center of mass. This can be generalized to three points and four
points to define projective coordinates in the plane, and in space,
respectively.
**** Systems with periodic boundary conditions[edit] ****
For particles in a system with periodic_boundary_conditions two particles can
be neighbours even though they are on opposite sides of the system. This occurs
often in molecular_dynamics simulations, for example, in which clusters form at
random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary.
When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the
center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the
center of mass for periodic systems is to treat each coordinate, x and y and/or
z, as if it were on a circle instead of a line.[10] The calculation takes every
particle's x coordinate and maps it to an angle,
          &#x03B8;  i   =    x  i    x  m a x     2 &#x03C0;   {\displaystyle
      \theta _{i}={\frac {x_{i}}{x_{max}}}2\pi }  [\theta _{i}={\frac {x_{i}}
      {x_{max}}}2\pi ]
where xmax is the system size in the x direction and      x  i   &#x2208; [ 0 ,
x  m a x   )   {\displaystyle x_{i}\in [0,x_{max})}  [{\displaystyle x_{i}\in
[0,x_{max})}]. From this angle, two new points     (  &#x03BE;  i   ,  &#x03B6;
i   )   {\displaystyle (\xi _{i},\zeta _{i})}  [(\xi _{i},\zeta _{i})] can be
generated, which can be weighted by the mass of the particle      x  i
{\displaystyle x_{i}}  [x_{i}] for the center of mass or given a value of 1 for
the geometric center:
          &#x03BE;  i   = cos &#x2061; (  &#x03B8;  i   )   {\displaystyle \xi
      _{i}=\cos(\theta _{i})}  [{\displaystyle \xi _{i}=\cos(\theta _{i})}]
          &#x03B6;  i   = sin &#x2061; (  &#x03B8;  i   )   {\displaystyle
      \zeta _{i}=\sin(\theta _{i})}  [\zeta _{i}=\sin(\theta _{i})]
In the     ( &#x03BE; , &#x03B6; )   {\displaystyle (\xi ,\zeta )}  [(\xi
,\zeta )] plane, these coordinates lie on a circle of radius 1. From the
collection of      &#x03BE;  i     {\displaystyle \xi _{i}}  [\xi _{i}] and
&#x03B6;  i     {\displaystyle \zeta _{i}}  [\zeta _{i}] values from all the
particles, the averages       &#x03BE; &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle {\overline
{\xi }}}  [{\overline {\xi }}] and       &#x03B6; &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle
{\overline {\zeta }}}  [{\overline {\zeta }}] are calculated.
           &#x03BE; &#x00AF;   =   1 M    &#x2211;  i = 1   n    m  i
      &#x03BE;  i   ,   {\displaystyle {\overline {\xi }}={\frac {1}{M}}\sum _
      {i=1}^{n}m_{i}\xi _{i},}  [{\displaystyle {\overline {\xi }}={\frac {1}
      {M}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\xi _{i},}]
           &#x03B6; &#x00AF;   =   1 M    &#x2211;  i = 1   n    m  i
      &#x03B6;  i   ,   {\displaystyle {\overline {\zeta }}={\frac {1}{M}}\sum
      _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\zeta _{i},}  [{\displaystyle {\overline {\zeta }}={\frac
      {1}{M}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\zeta _{i},}]
where M is the sum of the masses of all of the particles.
These values are mapped back into a new angle,       &#x03B8; &#x00AF;
{\displaystyle {\overline {\theta }}}  [{\overline {\theta }}], from which the
x coordinate of the center of mass can be obtained:
           &#x03B8; &#x00AF;   =  a t a n 2  ( &#x2212;   &#x03B6; &#x00AF;   ,
      &#x2212;   &#x03BE; &#x00AF;   ) + &#x03C0;   {\displaystyle {\overline
      {\theta }}=\mathrm {atan2} (-{\overline {\zeta }},-{\overline {\xi
      }})+\pi }  [{\overline {\theta }}=\mathrm {atan2} (-{\overline {\zeta
      }},-{\overline {\xi }})+\pi ]
          x  c o m   =  x  m a x      &#x03B8; &#x00AF;   2 &#x03C0;
      {\displaystyle x_{com}=x_{max}{\frac {\overline {\theta }}{2\pi }}}  [x_
      {com}=x_{max}{\frac {\overline {\theta }}{2\pi }}]
The process can be repeated for all dimensions of the system to determine the
complete center of mass. The utility of the algorithm is that it allows the
mathematics to determine where the "best" center of mass is, instead of
guessing or using cluster_analysis to "unfold" a cluster straddling the
periodic boundaries. If both average values are zero,     (   &#x03BE; &#x00AF;
,   &#x03B6; &#x00AF;   ) = ( 0 , 0 )   {\displaystyle ({\overline {\xi }},
{\overline {\zeta }})=(0,0)}  [({\overline {\xi }},{\overline {\zeta }})=
(0,0)], then       &#x03B8; &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle {\overline {\theta }}}
[{\overline {\theta }}] is undefined. This is a correct result, because it only
occurs when all particles are exactly evenly spaced. In that condition, their x
coordinates are mathematically identical in a periodic_system.
***** Center of gravity[edit] *****
"Center of gravity" redirects here. For other uses, see Center_of_gravity_
(disambiguation).
Main article: Centers_of_gravity_in_non-uniform_fields
A body's center of gravity is the point around which the resultant_torque due
to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can be considered to be
uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same. However,
for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being
applied to a satellite, the slight variation (gradient) in gravitational field
between closer-to (stronger) and further-from (weaker) the planet can lead to a
torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is
vertical. In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the
center-of-gravity and the mass-center. Any horizontal offset between the two
will result in an applied torque.
It is useful to note that the mass-center is a fixed property for a given rigid
body (e.g. with no slosh or articulation), whereas the center-of-gravity may,
in addition, depend upon its orientation in a non-uniform gravitational field.
In the latter case, the center-of-gravity will always be located somewhat
closer to the main attractive body as compared to the mass-center, and thus
will change its position in the body of interest as its orientation is changed.
In the study of the dynamics of aircraft, vehicles and vessels, forces and
moments need to be resolved relative to the mass center. That is true
independent of whether gravity itself is a consideration. Referring to the
mass-center as the center-of-gravity is something of a colloquialism, but it is
in common usage and when gravity gradient effects are negligible, center-of-
gravity and mass-center are the same and are used interchangeably.
In physics the benefits of using the center of mass to model a mass
distribution can be seen by considering the resultant of the gravity forces on
a continuous body. Consider a body Q of volume V with density Ï(r) at each
point r in the volume. In a parallel gravity field the force f at each point r
is given by,
          f  (  r  ) = &#x2212; d m  g    k &#x2192;    = &#x2212; &#x03C1;
      (  r  ) d V  g    k &#x2192;    ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} (\mathbf
      {r} )=-dm\,g{\vec {k}}=-\rho (\mathbf {r} )dV\,g{\vec {k}},}  [\mathbf
      {f} (\mathbf {r} )=-dm\,g{\vec {k}}=-\rho (\mathbf {r} )dV\,g{\vec {k}},]
where dm is the mass at the point r, g is the acceleration of gravity, and k is
a unit vector defining the vertical direction. Choose a reference point R in
the volume and compute the resultant_force and torque at this point,
          F  =  &#x222D;  Q    f  (  r  ) d V =  &#x222D;  Q   &#x03C1; (  r  )
      d V ( &#x2212; g    k &#x2192;    ) = &#x2212; M g    k &#x2192;    ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\iiint \limits _{Q}\mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r}
      )dV=\iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )dV(-g{\vec {k}})=-Mg{\vec
      {k}},}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\iiint \limits _{Q}\mathbf {f}
      (\mathbf {r} )dV=\iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )dV(-g{\vec {k}})=-
      Mg{\vec {k}},}]
and
          T  =  &#x222D;  Q   (  r  &#x2212;  R  ) &#x00D7;  f  (  r  ) d V =
      &#x222D;  Q   (  r  &#x2212;  R  ) &#x00D7; ( &#x2212; g &#x03C1; (  r  )
      d V    k &#x2192;    ) =  (   &#x222D;  Q   &#x03C1; (  r  ) (  r
      &#x2212;  R  ) d V  )  &#x00D7; ( &#x2212; g    k &#x2192;    ) .
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\iiint \limits _{Q}(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {R}
      )\times \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r} )dV=\iiint \limits _{Q}(\mathbf {r} -
      \mathbf {R} )\times (-g\rho (\mathbf {r} )dV{\vec {k}})=\left(\iiint
      \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {R} )dV\right)\times
      (-g{\vec {k}}).}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\iiint \limits _{Q}
      (\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {R} )\times \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r} )dV=\iiint
      \limits _{Q}(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {R} )\times (-g\rho (\mathbf {r} )dV
      {\vec {k}})=\left(\iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )(\mathbf {r} -
      \mathbf {R} )dV\right)\times (-g{\vec {k}}).}]
If the reference point R is chosen so that it is the center of mass, then
          &#x222D;  Q   &#x03C1; (  r  ) (  r  &#x2212;  R  ) d V = 0 ,
      {\displaystyle \iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )(\mathbf {r} -
      \mathbf {R} )dV=0,}  [{\displaystyle \iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r}
      )(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {R} )dV=0,}]
which means the resultant torque T=0. Because the resultant torque is zero the
body will move as though it is a particle with its mass concentrated at the
center of mass.
By selecting the center of gravity as the reference point for a rigid body, the
gravity forces will not cause the body to rotate, which means the weight of the
body can be considered to be concentrated at the center of mass.
***** Linear and angular momentum[edit] *****
The linear and angular momentum of a collection of particles can be simplified
by measuring the position and velocity of the particles relative to the center
of mass. Let the system of particles Pi, i=1,...,n of masses mi be located at
the coordinates ri with velocities vi. Select a reference point R and compute
the relative position and velocity vectors,
           r   i   = (   r   i   &#x2212;  R  ) +  R  ,    v   i   =   d  d t
      (   r   i   &#x2212;  R  ) +  v  .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{i}=
      (\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )+\mathbf {R} ,\quad \mathbf {v} _{i}=
      {\frac {d}{dt}}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )+\mathbf {v} .}  [\mathbf
      {r} _{i}=(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )+\mathbf {R} ,\quad \mathbf {v} _
      {i}={\frac {d}{dt}}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )+\mathbf {v} .]
The total linear and angular momentum vectors relative to the reference point R
are
          p  =   d  d t     (   &#x2211;  i = 1   n    m  i   (   r   i
      &#x2212;  R  )  )  +  (   &#x2211;  i = 1   n    m  i    )   v  ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ={\frac {d}{dt}}\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}
      (\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )\right)+\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_
      {i}\right)\mathbf {v} ,}  [\mathbf {p} ={\frac {d}{dt}}\left(\sum _{i=1}^
      {n}m_{i}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )\right)+\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_
      {i}\right)\mathbf {v} ,]
and
          L  =  &#x2211;  i = 1   n    m  i   (   r   i   &#x2212;  R  )
      &#x00D7;   d  d t    (   r   i   &#x2212;  R  ) +  (   &#x2211;  i = 1
      n    m  i   (   r   i   &#x2212;  R  )  )  &#x00D7;  v  .
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf
      {R} )\times {\frac {d}{dt}}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )+\left(\sum _
      {i=1}^{n}m_{i}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )\right)\times \mathbf {v} .}
      [\mathbf {L} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )\times
      {\frac {d}{dt}}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )+\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}
      (\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )\right)\times \mathbf {v} .]
If R is chosen as the center of mass these equations simplify to
          p  = m  v  ,   L  =  &#x2211;  i = 1   n    m  i   (   r   i
      &#x2212;  R  ) &#x00D7;   d  d t    (   r   i   &#x2212;  R  ) ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} ,\quad \mathbf {L} =\sum _{i=1}^
      {n}m_{i}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )\times {\frac {d}{dt}}(\mathbf {r}
      _{i}-\mathbf {R} ),}  [\mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} ,\quad \mathbf {L} =\sum
      _{i=1}^{n}m_{i}(\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )\times {\frac {d}{dt}}
      (\mathbf {r} _{i}-\mathbf {R} ),]
where m is the total mass of all the particles, p is the linear momentum, and L
is the angular momentum
The Law_of_Conservation_of_Momentum predicts that for any system not subjected
to external forces the momentum of the system will remain constant, which means
the center of mass will move with constant velocity. This applies for all
systems with classical internal forces, including magnetic fields, electric
fields, chemical reactions, and so on. More formally, this is true for any
internal forces that cancel in accordance with Newton's_Third_Law.[11]
***** Locating the center of mass[edit] *****
Main article: Locating_the_center_of_mass
Plumb line method
The experimental determination of the center of mass of a body uses gravity
forces on the body and relies on the fact that in the parallel gravity field
near the surface of the earth the center of mass is the same as the center of
gravity.
The center of mass of a body with an axis of symmetry and constant density must
lie on this axis. Thus, the center of mass of a circular cylinder of constant
density has its center of mass on the axis of the cylinder. In the same way,
the center of mass of a spherically symmetric body of constant density is at
the center of the sphere. In general, for any symmetry of a body, its center of
mass will be a fixed point of that symmetry.[12]
**** In two dimensions[edit] ****
An experimental method for locating the center of mass is to suspend the object
from two locations and to drop plumb_lines from the suspension points. The
intersection of the two lines is the center of mass.[13]
The shape of an object might already be mathematically determined, but it may
be too complex to use a known formula. In this case, one can subdivide the
complex shape into simpler, more elementary shapes, whose centers of mass are
easy to find. If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each
area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the
centers.[14] This method can even work for objects with holes, which can be
accounted for as negative masses.[15]
A direct development of the planimeter known as an integraph, or integerometer,
can be used to establish the position of the centroid or center of mass of an
irregular two-dimensional shape. This method can be applied to a shape with an
irregular, smooth or complex boundary where other methods are too difficult. It
was regularly used by ship builders to compare with the required displacement
and center_of_buoyancy of a ship, and ensure it would not capsize.[16][17]
**** In three dimensions[edit] ****
An experimental method to locate the three-dimensional coordinates of the
center of mass begins by supporting the object at three points and measuring

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {k}} }  [\mathbf{\hat{k}}] is the unit vector in
the vertical direction). Let r1, r2, and r3 be the position coordinates of the
support points, then the coordinates R of the center of mass satisfy the
condition that the resultant torque is zero,
          T  = (   r   1   &#x2212;  R  ) &#x00D7;   F   1   + (   r   2
      &#x2212;  R  ) &#x00D7;   F   2   + (   r   3   &#x2212;  R  ) &#x00D7;

      [\mathbf {T} =(\mathbf {r} _{1}-\mathbf {R} )\times \mathbf {F} _{1}+

or
          R  &#x00D7; ( &#x2212; W    k &#x005E;    ) =   r   1   &#x00D7;   F

This equation yields the coordinates of the center of mass R* in the horizontal
plane as,
           R   &#x2217;   = &#x2212;   1 W      k &#x005E;    &#x00D7; (   r

      \mathbf {F} _{3}).}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ^{*}=-{\frac {1}
      {W}}\mathbf {\hat {k}} \times (\mathbf {r} _{1}\times \mathbf {F} _
      {1}+\mathbf {r} _{2}\times \mathbf {F} _{2}+\mathbf {r} _{3}\times
      \mathbf {F} _{3}).}]
The center of mass lies on the vertical line L, given by
          L  ( t ) =   R   &#x2217;   + t    k &#x005E;    .   {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {L} (t)=\mathbf {R} ^{*}+t\mathbf {\hat {k}} .}  [{\displaystyle
      \mathbf {L} (t)=\mathbf {R} ^{*}+t\mathbf {\hat {k}} .}]
The three-dimensional coordinates of the center of mass are determined by
performing this experiment twice with the object positioned so that these
forces are measured for two different horizontal planes through the object. The
center of mass will be the intersection of the two lines L1 and L2 obtained
from the two experiments.
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Engineering designs[edit] ****
*** Automotive applications[edit] ***
Engineers try to design a sports_car so that its center of mass is lowered to
make the car handle better, that is maintaining traction while executing
relatively sharp turns.
The characteristic low profile of the U. S. military Humvee was designed in
part to allow it tilt farther than taller vehicles, without a rollover, because
its low center of mass would stay over the space bounded the four wheels even
at angles far from the horizontal.
*** Aeronautics[edit] ***
Main article: Center_of_gravity_of_an_aircraft
The center of mass is an important point on an aircraft, which significantly
affects the stability of the aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is stable enough
to be safe to fly, the center of mass must fall within specified limits. If the
center of mass is ahead of the forward limit, the aircraft will be less
maneuverable, possibly to the point of being unable to rotate for takeoff or
flare for landing.[18] If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the
aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly so
unstable that it is impossible to fly. The moment arm of the elevator will also
be reduced, which makes it more difficult to recover from a stalled condition.
[19]
For helicopters in hover, the center of mass is always directly below the
rotorhead. In forward flight, the center of mass will move forward to balance
the negative pitch torque produced by applying cyclic control to propel the
helicopter forward; consequently a cruising helicopter flies "nose-down" in
level flight.[20]
**** Astronomy[edit] ****
Main article: Barycenter
Two bodies orbiting their barycenter (red cross)
The center of mass plays an important role in astronomy and astrophysics, where
it is commonly referred to as the barycenter. The barycenter is the point
between two objects where they balance each other; it is the center of mass
where two or more celestial bodies orbit each other. When a moon orbits a
planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting around a
point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body.[21] For
example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth, but a point on
a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710 km
(1,062 miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses
balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel
around the Sun. If the masses are more similar, e.g., Pluto_and_Charon, the
barycenter will fall outside both bodies.
**** Body motion[edit] ****
Estimated center of mass/gravity of a high jumper doing a Fosbury Flop. Note
that it is below the bar in this position.
When high_jumpers perform a "Fosbury_Flop", they bend their respective bodies
in such a way that they clear the bar while their respective centers of mass do
not necessarily do so.[22] Because it is the height of the center of gravity
(rather than of the highest part of the body) that constrains the minimum
energy investment for "clearing" the bar, "snaking over" the bar can reduce the
energy expended in propelling the body upward.
Main article: Kinesiology
In kinesiology and biomechanics, the center of mass is an important parameter
that assists people in understanding their human locomotion. Typically, a
humanâs center of mass is detected with one of two methods: The reaction
board method is a static analysis that involves the person lying down on that
instrument, and use of their static_equilibrium equation to find their center
of mass; the segmentation method relies on a mathematical solution based on the
physical_principle that the summation of the torques of individual body
sections, relative_to a specified axis, must equal the torque of the whole
system that constitutes the body, measured relative to the same axis.[23]
