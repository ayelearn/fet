Prestressed concrete is a form of concrete used in construction. It is
substantially "prestressed" (compressed) during its fabrication, in a manner
that strengthens it against tensile forces which will exist when in service.[1]
[2]:3â5[3]
This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength "tendons"
located within or adjacent to the concrete and is done to improve the
performance of the concrete in service.[4] Tendons may consist of single wires,
multi-wire strands or threaded bars that are most commonly made from high-
tensile_steels, carbon_fiber or aramid_fiber.[1]:52â59 The essence of
prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the
resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when
subject to any subsequent compression_forces and of ductile high-strength steel
when subject to tension_forces. This can result in improved structural capacity
and/or serviceability compared with conventionally reinforced_concrete in many
situations.[5][2]:6 In a prestressed concrete member, the internal stresses are
introduced in a planned manner so that the stresses resulting from the
superimposed loads are counteracted to the desired degree.
Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures
where its improved performance can allow for longer spans, reduced structural
thicknesses, and material savings compared with simple reinforced_concrete.
Typical applications include high-rise_buildings, residential slabs, foundation
systems, bridge and dam structures, silos and tanks, industrial_pavements and
nuclear_containment_structures.[6]
First used in the late-nineteenth century,[1] prestressed concrete has
developed beyond pre-tensioning to include post-tensioning, which occurs after
the concrete is cast. Tensioning systems may be classed as either monostrand,
where each tendon's strand or wire is stressed individually, or multi-strand,
where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously.[5] Tendons
may be located either within the concrete volume (internal prestressing) or
wholly outside of it (external prestressing). While pre-tensioned concrete uses
tendons directly bonded to the concrete, post-tensioned concrete can use either
bonded or unbonded tendons.

***** Pre-tensioned concrete[edit] *****

Pre-tensioning process
[Form_for_concrete_I-beam_with_tendons_in_lower_portion]

exiting through the formwork
Pre-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons
are tensioned prior to the concrete being cast.[1]:25 The concrete bonds to the
tendons as it cures, following which the end-anchoring of the tendons is
released, and the tendon tension_forces are transferred to the concrete as
compression by static_friction.[5]:7
Pre-tensioning is a common prefabrication technique, where the resulting
concrete element is manufactured remotely from the final structure location and
transported to site once cured. It requires strong, stable end-anchorage points
between which the tendons are stretched. These anchorages form the ends of a
"casting bed" which may be many times the length of the concrete element being
fabricated. This allows multiple elements to be constructed end-to-end in the
one pre-tensioning operation, allowing significant productivity benefits and
economies of scale to be realized.[5][7]
The amount of bond (or adhesion) achievable between the freshly set concrete
and the surface of the tendons is critical to the pre-tensioning process, as it
determines when the tendon anchorages can be safely released. Higher bond
strength in early-age concrete will speed production and allow more economical
fabrication. To promote this, pre-tensioned tendons are usually composed of
isolated single wires or strands, which provides a greater surface_area for
bonding than bundled-strand tendons.[5]
[Crane_manoeuvres_concrete_plank]
Pre-tensioned hollow-core plank being placed
Unlike those of post-tensioned concrete (see below), the tendons of pre-
tensioned concrete elements generally form straight lines between end-
anchorages. Where "profiled" or "harped" tendons[8] are required, one or more
intermediate deviators are located between the ends of the tendon to hold the
tendon to the desired non-linear alignment during tensioning.[1]:68â73[5]:11
Such deviators usually act against substantial forces, and hence require a
robust casting-bed foundation system. Straight tendons are typically used in
"linear" precast elements, such as shallow beams, hollow-core planks and slabs;
whereas profiled tendons are more commonly found in deeper precast bridge beams
and girders.
Pre-tensioned concrete is most commonly used for the fabrication of structural
beams, floor_slabs, hollow-core_planks, balconies, lintels, driven piles, water
tanks and concrete pipes.
***** Post-tensioned concrete[edit] *****

[A_dozen_parallel_cables_are_individually_anchored_to_an_assembly.]
Post-tensioned tendon anchorage; four-piece "lock-off" wedges are visible

Post-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons
are tensioned after the surrounding concrete structure has been cast.[1]:25
The tendons are not placed in direct contact with the concrete, but are
encapsulated within a protective sleeve or duct which is either cast into the
concrete structure or placed adjacent to it. At each end of a tendon is an
anchorage assembly firmly fixed to the surrounding concrete. Once the concrete
has been cast and set, the tendons are tensioned ("stressed") by pulling the
tendon ends through the anchorages while pressing against the concrete. The
large forces required to tension the tendons result in a significant permanent
compression being applied to the concrete once the tendon is "locked-off" at
the anchorage.[1]:25[5]:7 The method of locking the tendon-ends to the
anchorage is dependent upon the tendon composition, with the most common
systems being "button-head" anchoring (for wire tendons), split-wedge anchoring
(for strand tendons), and threaded anchoring (for bar tendons).[1]:79â84
[A_T-shaped_section_of_bridge_being_constructed_over_a_river]

Tendon encapsulation systems are constructed from plastic or galvanised steel
materials, and are classified into two main types: those where the tendon
element is subsequently bonded to the surrounding concrete by internal grouting
of the duct after stressing (bonded post-tensioning); and those where the
tendon element is permanently debonded from the surrounding concrete, usually
by means of a greased sheath over the tendon strands (unbonded post-
tensioning).[1]:26[5]:10
Casting the tendon ducts/sleeves into the concrete before any tensioning occurs
allows them to be readily "profiled" to any desired shape including
incorporating vertical and/or horizontal curvature. When the tendons are
tensioned, this profiling results in reaction forces being imparted onto the
hardened concrete, and these can be beneficially used to counter any loadings
subsequently applied to the structure.[2]:5â6[5]:48:9â10
**** Bonded post-tensioning[edit] ****
[a_detached_anchor_displaying_tendon_lock-offs]
Multi-strand post-tensioning anchor
In bonded post-tensioning, prestressing tendons are permanently bonded to the
surrounding concrete by the in_situ grouting of their encapsulating ducting
(after tendon tensioning). This grouting is undertaken for three main purposes:
to protect the tendons against corrosion; to permanently "lock-in" the tendon
pre-tension, thereby removing the long-term reliance upon the end-anchorage
systems; and to improve certain structural_behaviors of the final concrete
structure.[9]
Bonded post-tensioning characteristically uses tendons each comprising bundles
of elements (e.g. strands or wires) placed inside a single tendon duct, with
the exception of bars which are mostly used unbundled. This bundling makes for
more efficient tendon installation and grouting processes, since each complete
tendon requires only one set of end-anchorages and one grouting operation.
Ducting is fabricated from a durable and corrosion-resistant material such as
plastic (e.g. polyethylene) or galvanised steel, and can be either round or
rectangular/oval in cross-section.[2]:7 The tendon sizes used are highly
dependent upon the application, ranging from building works typically using
between 2 and 6 strands per tendon, to specialized dam works using up to 91
strands per tendon.
Fabrication of bonded tendons is generally undertaken on-site, commencing with
the fitting of end-anchorages to formwork, placing the tendon ducting to the
required curvature profiles, and reeving (or threading) the strands or wires
through the ducting. Following concreting and tensioning, the ducts are
pressure-grouted and the tendon stressing-ends sealed against corrosion.[5]:2
**** Unbonded post-tensioning[edit] ****
[prepared_concrete_forms_with_grid_of_tendons_and_ducts]

Unbonded slab post-tensioning. (Above) Installed strands and edge-anchors are

End-view of slab after stripping forms, showing individual strands and
stressing-anchor recesses.
Unbonded post-tensioning differs from bonded post-tensioning by allowing the
tendons permanent freedom of longitudinal movement relative to the concrete.
This is most commonly achieved by encasing each individual tendon element
within a plastic sheathing filled with a corrosion-inhibiting grease, usually
lithium based. Anchorages at each end of the tendon transfer the tensioning
force to the concrete, and are required to reliably perform this role for the
life of the structure.[9]:1
Unbonded post-tensioning can take the form of:
    * Individual strand tendons placed directly into the concreted structure
      (e.g. buildings, ground slabs), or
    * Bundled strands, individually greased-and-sheathed, forming a single
      tendon within an encapsulating duct that is placed either within or
      adjacent to the concrete (e.g. restressable anchors, external post-
      tensioning)
For individual strand tendons, no additional tendon ducting is used and no
post-stressing grouting operation is required, unlike for bonded post-
tensioning. Permanent corrosion protection of the strands is provided by the
combined layers of grease, plastic sheathing, and surrounding concrete. Where
strands are bundled to form a single unbonded tendon, an enveloping duct of
plastic or galvanised steel is used and its interior free-spaces grouted after
stressing. In this way, additional corrosion protection is provided via the
grease, plastic sheathing, grout, external sheathing, and surrounding concrete
layers.[9]:1
Individually greased-and-sheathed tendons are usually fabricated off-site by an
extrusion process. The bare steel strand is fed into a greasing chamber and
then passed to an extrusion unit where molten plastic forms a continuous outer
coating. Finished strands can be cut-to-length and fitted with "dead-end"
anchor assemblies as required for the project.
**** Comparison between bonded and unbonded post-tensioning[edit] ****
Both bonded and unbonded post-tensioning technologies are widely used around
the world, and the choice of system is often dictated by regional preferences,
contractor experience, or the availability of alternative systems. Either one
is capable of delivering code-compliant, durable structures meeting the
structural strength and serviceability requirements of the designer.[9]:2
The benefits that bonded post-tensioning can offer over unbonded systems are:
    * Reduced reliance on end-anchorage integrity
      Following tensioning and grouting, bonded tendons are connected to the
      surrounding concrete along their full length by high-strength grout. Once
      cured, this grout can transfer the full tendon tension force to the
      concrete within a very short distance (approximately 1 metre). As a
      result, any inadvertent severing of the tendon or failure of an end
      anchorage has only a very localised impact on tendon performance, and
      almost never results in tendon ejection from the anchorage.[2]:18[9]:7
    * Increased ultimate_strength in flexure
      With bonded post-tensioning, any flexure of the structure is directly
      resisted by tendon strains at that same location (i.e. no strain re-
      distribution occurs). This results in significantly higher tensile
      strains in the tendons than if they were unbonded, allowing their full
      yield_strength to be realised, and producing a higher ultimate load
      capacity.[2]:16â17[5]:10
    * Improved crack-control
      In the presence of concrete cracking, bonded tendons respond similarly to
      conventional reinforcement (rebar). With the tendons fixed to the
      concrete at each side of the crack, greater resistance to crack expansion
      is offered than with unbonded tendons, allowing many design codes to
      specify reduced reinforcement requirements for bonded post-tensioning.
      [9]:4[10]:1
    * Improved fire performance
      The absence of strain redistribution in bonded tendons may limit the
      impact that any localised overheating has on the overall structure. As a
      result, bonded structures may display a higher capacity to resist fire
      conditions than unbonded ones.[11]
The benefits that unbonded post-tensioning can offer over bonded systems are:
    * Ability to be prefabricated
      Unbonded tendons can be readily prefabricated off-site complete with end-
      anchorages, facilitating faster installation during construction.
      Additional lead_time may need to be allowed for this fabrication process.
    * Improved site productivity
      The elimination of the post-stressing grouting process required in bonded
      structures improves the site-labour productivity of unbonded post-
      tensioning.[9]:5
    * Improved installation flexibility
      Unbonded single-strand tendons have greater handling flexibility than
      bonded ducting during installation, allowing them a greater ability to be
      deviated around service penetrations or obstructions.[9]:5
    * Reduced concrete_cover
      Unbonded tendons may allow some reduction in concrete element thickness,
      as their smaller size and increased corrosion protection may allow them
      to be placed closer to the concrete surface.[2]:8
    * Simpler replacement and/or adjustment
      Being permanently isolated from the concrete, unbonded tendons are able
      to be readily de-stressed, re-stressed and/or replaced should they become
      damaged or need their force levels to be modified in-service.[9]:6
    * Superior overload performance
      Although having a lower ultimate strength than bonded tendons, unbonded
      tendons' ability to redistribute strains over their full length can give
      them superior pre-collapse ductility. In extremes, unbonded tendons can
      resort to a catenary-type action instead of pure flexure, allowing
      significantly greater deformation before structural failure.[12]
***** Tendon durability and corrosion protection[edit] *****
Long-term durability is an essential requirement for prestressed concrete given
its widespread use. Research on the durability performance of in-service
prestressed structures has been undertaken since the 1960s,[13] and anti-
corrosion technologies for tendon protection have been continually improved
since the earliest systems were developed.[14]
The durability of prestressed concrete is principally determined by the level
of corrosion protection provided to any high-strength steel elements within the
prestressing tendons. Also critical is the protection afforded to the end-
anchorage assemblies of unbonded tendons or cable-stay systems, as the
anchorages of both of these are required to retain the prestressing forces.
Failure of any of these components can result in the release of prestressing
forces, or the physical rupture of stressing tendons.
Modern prestressing systems deliver long-term durability by addressing the
following areas:
    * Tendon grouting (bonded tendons)
      Bonded tendons consist of bundled strands placed inside ducts located
      within the surrounding concrete. To ensure full protection to the bundled
      strands, the ducts must be pressure-filled with a corrosion-inhibiting
      grout, without leaving any voids, following strand-tensioning.
    * Tendon coating (unbonded tendons)
      Unbonded tendons comprise individual strands coated in an anti-corrosion
      grease or wax, and fitted with a durable plastic-based full-length sleeve
      or sheath. The sleeving is required to be undamaged over the tendon
      length, and it must extend fully into the anchorage fittings at each end
      of the tendon.
    * Double-layer encapsulation
      Prestressing tendons requiring permanent monitoring and/or force
      adjustment, such as stay-cables and re-stressable dam anchors, will
      typically employ double-layer corrosion protection. Such tendons are
      composed of individual strands, grease-coated and sleeved, collected into
      a strand-bundle and placed inside encapsulating polyethylene outer
      ducting. The remaining void space within the duct is pressure-grouted,
      providing a multi-layer polythene-grout-plastic-grease protection barrier
      system for each strand.
    * Anchorage protection
      In all post-tensioned installations, protection of the end-anchorages
      against corrosion is essential, and critically so for unbonded systems.
Several durability-related events are listed below:
    * Ynys-y-Gwas bridge, West Glamorgan, Wales, 1985
      A single-span, precast-segmental structure constructed in 1953 with
      longitudinal and transverse post-tensioning. Corrosion attacked the
      under-protected tendons where they crossed the in-situ joints between the
      segments, leading to sudden collapse.[14]:40
    * Scheldt River bridge, Melle, Belgium, 1991
      A three-span prestressed cantilever_structure constructed in the 1950s.
      Inadequate concrete_cover in the side abutments resulted in tie-down
      cable corrosion, leading to a progressive failure of the main bridge span
      and the death of one person.[15]
    * UK_Highways_Agency, 1992
      Following discovery of tendon corrosion in several bridges in England,
      the Highways Agency issued a moratorium on the construction of new
      internally grouted post-tensioned bridges and embarked on a 5-year
      programme of inspections on its existing post-tensioned bridge stock. The
      moratorium was lifted in 1996.[16][17]
    * Pedestrian bridge, Charlotte_Motor_Speedway, North Carolina, US, 2000
      A multi-span steel and concrete structure constructed in 1995. An
      unauthorised chemical was added to the tendon grout to speed
      construction, leading to corrosion of the prestressing strands and the
      sudden collapse of one span, injuring many spectators.[18]
    * Hammersmith_Flyover London, England, 2011
      Sixteen-span prestressed structure constructed in 1961. Corrosion from
      road de-icing_salts was detected in some of the prestressing tendons,
      necessitating initial closure of the road while additional investigations
      were done. Subsequent repairs and strengthening using external post-
      tensioning was carried out and completed in 2015.[19][20]
    * Petrulla Viaduct, Sicily, Italy, 2014
      One span of the viaduct collapsed on 7 July due to corrosion of the post-
      tensioning tendons.
    * Genoa_bridge_collapse, 2018. The Ponte Morandi was a cable-stayed bridge
      characterised by a prestressed concrete structure for the piers, pylons
      and deck, very few stays, as few as two per span, and a hybrid system for
      the stays constructed from steel cables with prestressed concrete shells
      poured on. The concrete was only prestressed to 10 MPa, resulting in it
      being prone to cracks and water intrusion, which caused corrosion of the
      embedded steel.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Prestressed concrete is a highly versatile construction material as a result of
it being an almost ideal combination of its two main constituents: high-
strength steel, pre-stretched to allow its full strength to be easily realised;
and modern concrete, pre-compressed to minimise cracking under tensile forces.
[1]:12 Its wide range of application is reflected in its incorporation into the
major design codes covering most areas of structural and civil engineering,
including buildings, bridges, dams, foundations, pavements, piles, stadiums,
silos, and tanks.[6]
**** Building structures[edit] ****
Building structures are typically required to satisfy a broad range of
structural, aesthetic and economic requirements. Significant among these
include: a minimum number of (intrusive) supporting walls or columns; low
structural thickness (depth), allowing space for services, or for additional
floors in high-rise construction; fast construction cycles, especially for
multi-storey buildings; and a low cost-per-unit-area, to maximise the building
owner's return on investment.
The prestressing of concrete allows "load-balancing" forces to be introduced
into the structure to counter in-service loadings. This provides many benefits
to building structures:
    * Longer spans for the same structural depth
      Load balancing results in lower in-service deflections, which allows
      spans to be increased (and the number of supports reduced) without adding
      to structural depth.
    * Reduced structural thickness
      For a given span, lower in-service deflections allows thinner structural
      sections to be used, in turn resulting in lower floor-to-floor heights,
      or more room for building services.
    * Faster stripping time
      Typically, prestressed concrete building elements are fully stressed and
      self-supporting within five days. At this point they can have their
      formwork stripped and re-deployed to the next section of the building,
      accelerating construction "cycle-times".
    * Reduced material costs
      The combination of reduced structural thickness, reduced conventional
      reinforcement quantities, and fast construction often results in
      prestressed concrete showing significant cost benefits in building
      structures compared to alternative structural materials.
Some notable building structures constructed from prestressed concrete include:

**** Civil structures[edit] ****
*** Bridges[edit] ***
Concrete is the most popular structural material for bridges, and prestressed
concrete is frequently adopted.[33][34] When investigated in the 1940s for use
on heavy-duty bridges, the advantages of this type of bridge over more
traditional designs was that it is quicker to install, more economical and
longer-lasting with the bridge being less lively.[35][36] One of the first
bridges built in this way is the Adam_Viaduct, a railway bridge constructed
1946 in the UK.[37] By the 1960s, prestressed concrete largely superseded
reinforced concrete bridges in the UK, with box girders being the dominant
form.[38]
In short-span bridges of around 10 to 40 metres (30 to 130 ft), prestressing is
commonly employed in the form of precast pre-tensioned girders or planks.[39]
Medium-length structures of around 40 to 200 metres (150 to 650 ft), typically
use precast-segmental, in-situ balanced-cantilever and incrementally-launched
designs.[40] For the longest bridges, prestressed concrete deck structures
often form an integral part of cable-stayed_designs.[41]
*** Dams[edit] ***
Concrete dams have used prestressing to counter uplift and increase their
overall stability since the mid-1930s.[42][43] Prestressing is also frequently
retro-fitted as part of dam remediation works, such as for structural
strengthening, or when raising crest or spillway heights.[44][45]
Most commonly, dam prestressing takes the form of post-tensioned anchors
drilled into the dam's concrete structure and/or the underlying rock strata.
Such anchors typically comprise tendons of high-tensile bundled steel strands
or individual threaded bars. Tendons are grouted to the concrete or rock at
their far (internal) end, and have a significant "de-bonded" free-length at
their external end which allows the tendon to stretch during tensioning.
Tendons may be full-length bonded to the surrounding concrete or rock once
tensioned, or (more commonly) have strands permanently encapsulated in
corrosion-inhibiting grease over the free-length to permit long-term load
monitoring and re-stressability.[46]
*** Silos and tanks[edit] ***
Circular storage structures such as silos and tanks can use prestressing forces
to directly resist the outward pressures generated by stored liquids or bulk-
solids. Horizontally curved tendons are installed within the concrete wall to
form a series of hoops, spaced vertically up the structure. When tensioned,
these tendons exert both axial (compressive) and radial (inward) forces onto
the structure, which can directly oppose the subsequent storage loadings. If
the magnitude of the prestress is designed to always exceed the tensile
stresses produced by the loadings, a permanent residual compression will exist
in the wall concrete, assisting in maintaining a watertight crack-free
structure.[47][48][49][50]:61
*** Nuclear and blast-containment structures[edit] ***
Prestressed concrete has been established as a reliable construction material
for high-pressure containment structures such as nuclear reactor vessels and
containment buildings, and petrochemical tank blast-containment walls. Using
prestressing to place such structures into an initial state of bi-axial or tri-
axial compression increases their resistance to concrete cracking and leakage,
while providing a proof-loaded, redundant and monitorable pressure-containment
system.[51][52][53]:585â594
Nuclear reactor and containment vessels will commonly employ separate sets of
post-tensioned tendons curved horizontally or vertically to completely envelop
the reactor core. Blast containment walls, such as for liquid_natural_gas (LNG)
tanks, will normally utilise layers of horizontally-curved hoop tendons for
containment in combination with vertically looped tendons for axial wall
prestressing.
*** Hardstands and pavements[edit] ***
Heavily loaded concrete ground-slabs and pavements can be sensitive to cracking
and subsequent traffic-driven deterioration. As a result, prestressed concrete
is regularly used in such structures as its pre-compression provides the
concrete with the ability to resist the crack-inducing tensile stresses
generated by in-service loading. This crack-resistance also allows individual
slab sections to be constructed in larger pours than for conventionally
reinforced concrete, resulting in wider joint spacings, reduced jointing costs
and less long-term joint maintenance issues.[53]:594â598[54] Initial works
have also been successfully conducted on the use of precast prestressed
concrete for road pavements, where the speed and quality of the construction
has been noted as being beneficial for this technique.[55]

***** Design agencies and regulations[edit] *****
Worldwide, many professional organizations exist to promote best practices in
the design and construction of prestressed concrete structures. In the United
States, such organizations include the Post-Tensioning_Institute (PTI) and the
Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).[60] Similar bodies include the
Canadian Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (CPCI),[61] the UK's Post-
Tensioning Association,[62] the Post Tensioning Institute of Australia[63] and
the South African Post Tensioning Association.[64] Europe has similar country-
based associations and institutions.
It is important to note that these organizations are not the authorities of
building_codes or standards, but rather exist to promote the understanding and
development of prestressed concrete design, codes and best practices.
Rules and requirements for the detailing of reinforcement and prestressing
tendons are specified by individual national codes and standards such as:
    * European Standard EN_1992-2:2005 â Eurocode 2: Design of Concrete
      Structures;
    * US Standard ACI318: Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete;
      and
    * Australian_Standard AS 3600-2009: Concrete Structures.
