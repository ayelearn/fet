****** Noise pollution ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Traffic is the main source of noise pollution in cities (like Sao_Paulo shown
here) and other places.
A Qantas Boeing_747-400 passes close to houses shortly before landing at London
Heathrow_Airport.
Noise pollution, also known as environmental_noise or sound pollution, is the
propagation of noise with harmful impact on the activity of human or animal
life. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines,
transport (especially planes) and propagation systems.[1][2] Poor urban
planning may give rise to noise pollution, side-by-side industrial and
residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas.
Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud_music,
transportation noise, lawn care maintenance, nearby construction, explosions,
or young people yelling (sports games). Noise pollution associated with
household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in
many developing nations. The average noise level of 97.60 dB obtained exceeded
the WHO value of 50 dB allowed for residential areas.[3] Research suggests that
noise pollution is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods.
[4] Documented problems associated with urban environment noise go back as far
as ancient_Rome.[5]
High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an
increased incidence of coronary_artery_disease.[6][7] In animals, noise can
increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and
avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to
permanent hearing loss.[8] While the elderly may have cardiac problems due to
noise, according to the World Health Organization, children are especially
vulnerable to noise, and the effects that noise has on children may be
permanent.[9] Noise poses a serious threat to a childâs physical and
psychological health, and may negatively interfere with a child's learning and
behavior.[10]

Noise level from a leaf blower using NIOSH_Sound_Level_Meter_app
Main article: Health_effects_from_noise
Noise pollution affects both health and behavior. Unwanted sound (noise) can
damage physiological health. Noise pollution can cause hypertension, high
stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful
and disturbing effects.[6][11][12][13] According to a 2019 review of the
existing literature, noise pollution was associated with faster cognitive
decline.[14]
A sound_level_meter, is one of the main tools for measuring sounds in the
environment and the workplace
Sound becomes unwanted when it either interferes with normal activities such as
sleep or conversation, or disrupts or diminishes one's quality of life.[15]
Noise-induced_hearing_loss can be caused by prolonged exposure to noise levels
above 85 A-weighted decibels.[16] A comparison of Maaban tribesmen, who were
insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical
U.S. population showed that chronic exposure to moderately high levels of
environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.[11]
Noise exposure in the workplace can also contribute to noise-induced_hearing
loss and other health issues. Occupational hearing loss is one of the most
common work-related illnesses in the U.S. and worldwide.[17]
Less addressed is how humans adapt to noise subjectively. Indeed, tolerance for
noise is frequently independent of decibel levels. Murray Schafer's soundscape
research was groundbreaking in this regard. In his work, he makes compelling
arguments about how humans relate to noise on a subjective level, and how such
subjectivity is conditioned by culture.[18] Schafer also notes that sound is an
expression of power, and as such, material culture (e.g., fast cars or Harley
Davidson motorcycles with aftermarket pipes) tend to have louder engines not
only for safety reasons, but for expressions of power by dominating the
soundscape with a particular sound. Other key research in this area can be seen
in Fong's comparative analysis of soundscape differences between Bangkok,
Thailand and Los Angeles, California, US. Based on Schafer's research, Fong's
study showed how soundscapes differ based on the level of urban development in
the area. He found that cities in the periphery have different soundscapes than
inner city areas. Fong's findings tie not only soundscape appreciation to
subjective views of sound, but also demonstrates how different sounds of the
soundscape are indicative of class differences in urban environments.[19]
Noise pollution can have negative affects on adults and children on the
autistic_spectrum.[20] Those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can have
hyperacusis, which is an abnormal sensitivity to sound.[21] People with ASD who
experience hyperacusis may have unpleasant emotions, such as fear and anxiety,
and uncomfortable physical sensations in noisy environments with loud sounds.
[22] This can cause individuals with ASD to avoid environments with noise
pollution, which in turn can result in isolation and negatively affect their
quality of life. Sudden explosive noises typical of high-performance car
exhausts and car alarms are types of noise pollution that can affect people
with ASD.[20]
**** Wildlife[edit] ****
Noise can have a detrimental effect on animals, increasing the risk of death by
changing the delicate balance in predator or prey detection and avoidance, and
interfering the use of the sounds in communication, especially in relation to
reproduction and in navigation. These effects then may alter more interactions
within a community through indirect (âdominoâ) effects.[23] Acoustic
overexposure can lead to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.
European_robins living in urban environments are more likely to sing at night
in places with high levels of noise pollution during the day, suggesting that
they sing at night because it is quieter, and their message can propagate
through the environment more clearly.[24] The same study showed that daytime
noise was a stronger predictor of nocturnal singing than night-time light
pollution, to which the phenomenon often is attributed. Anthropogenic noise
reduced the species richness of birds found in Neoptropical urban parks.[25]
Zebra_finches become less faithful to their partners when exposed to traffic
noise. This could alter a population's evolutionary trajectory by selecting
traits, sapping resources normally devoted to other activities and thus leading
to profound genetic and evolutionary consequences.[26]
Underwater noise pollution due to human activities is also prevalent in the
sea. Cargo ships generate high levels of noise due to propellers and diesel
engines[27] [28]. This noise pollution significantly raises the low-frequency
ambient noise levels above those caused by wind[29]. Animals such as whales
that depend on sound for communication can be affected by this noise in various
ways. Even marine invertebrates, such as crabs (Carcinus_maenas), have been
shown to be negatively affected by ship noise.[30][31] Larger crabs were noted
to be negatively affected more by the sounds than smaller crabs. Repeated
exposure to the sounds did lead to acclimatization.[31]
Higher ambient noise levels also cause animals to vocalize more loudly, which
is called the Lombard_effect. Researchers have found that humpback whales' song
lengths were longer when low-frequency sonar was active nearby.[32]
Noise pollution may have caused the death of certain species of whales that
beached themselves after being exposed to the loud sound of military sonar.[33]

***** Noise control[edit] *****
The sound_tube in Melbourne, Australia is designed to reduce roadway_noise
without detracting from the area's aesthetics.
[A_man_inserting_an_earplug_in_his_ear_to_reduce_his_noise_exposure]
A man inserting an earplug in his ear to reduce the noise exposure
Main article: Noise_control
The Hierarchy of Controls concept is often used to reduce noise in the
environment or the workplace. Engineering noise controls can be used to reduce
noise propagation and protect individuals from overexposure. When noise
controls are not feasible or adequate, individuals can also take steps to
protect themselves from the harmful effects of noise pollution. If people must
be around loud sounds, they can protect their ears with hearing protection
(e.g., ear plugs or ear muffs).[34] In recent years, Buy_Quiet programs and
initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures.
These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and
encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.[35]
Noise from roadways and other urban factors can be mitigated by urban_planning
and better_design_of_roads. Roadway_noise can be reduced by the use of noise
barriers, limitation of vehicle speeds, alteration of roadway surface texture,
limitation of heavy_vehicles, use of traffic controls that smooth vehicle flow
to reduce braking and acceleration, and tire design. An important factor in
applying these strategies is a computer_model for roadway_noise, that is
capable of addressing local topography, meteorology, traffic operations, and
hypothetical mitigation. Costs of building-in mitigation can be modest,
provided these solutions are sought in the planning stage of a roadway project.
Aircraft_noise can be reduced by using quieter jet_engines. Altering flight
paths and time of day runway has benefited residents near airports.
***** Legal status[edit] *****
Main article: Noise_regulation
Up until the 1970s governments tended to view noise as a "nuisance" rather than
an environmental problem.
Many conflicts over noise pollution are handled by negotiation between the
emitter and the receiver. Escalation procedures vary by country, and may
include action in conjunction with local authorities, in particular the police.
**** India[edit] ****
Noise pollution is a major problem in India.[36] The government of India has
rules and regulations against firecrackers and loudspeakers, but enforcement is
extremely lax.[37] Awaaz_Foundation is a non-governmental organization in India
working to control noise pollution from various sources through advocacy,
public interest litigation, awareness, and educational campaigns since 2003.
[38] Despite increased enforcement and stringency of laws now being practised
in urban areas, rural areas are still affected. The Supreme Court of India had
banned playing of music on loudspeakers after 10pm. In 2015, The National Green
Tribunal directed authorities in Delhi to ensure strict adherence to guidelines
on noise pollution, saying noise is more than just a nuisance as it can produce
serious psychological stress. However, implementation of the law continues to
remain poor.[39]
**** Sweden[edit] ****
How noise emissions should be reduced, without the industry being hit too hard,
is a major problem in environmental care in Sweden today. The Swedish_Work
Environment_Authority has set an input value of 80 dB for maximum sound
exposure for eight hours. In workplaces where there is a need to be able to
converse comfortably the background noise level should not exceed 40 dB.[40]
The government of Sweden has taken soundproofing and acoustic absorbing
actions, such as noise_barriers and active_noise_control.
**** United Kingdom[edit] ****
Figures compiled by rockwool, the mineral_wool insulation manufacturer, based
on responses from local authorities to a Freedom_of_Information_Act (FOI)
request reveal in the period April 2008 â 2009 UK_councils received 315,838
complaints about noise pollution from private residences. This resulted in
environmental health officers across the UK serving 8,069 noise_abatement
notices or citations under the terms of the Anti-Social Behaviour (Scotland)
Act. In the last 12 months, 524 confiscations of equipment have been authorized
involving the removal of powerful speakers, stereos and televisions.
Westminster_City_Council has received more complaints per head of population
than any other district in the UK with 9,814 grievances about noise, which
equates to 42.32 complaints per thousand residents. Eight of the top 10
councils ranked by complaints per 1,000 residents are located in London.[41]
**** United States[edit] ****
The Noise_Control_Act of 1972 established a U.S. national policy to promote an
environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health and
welfare. In the past, Environmental_Protection_Agency coordinated all federal
noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The
EPA phased out the office's funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise
control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to
state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the
Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in
effect today, although essentially unfunded.[42]
The Federal_Aviation_Administration (FAA) regulates aircraft_noise by
specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit
through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These
standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by "stage"
designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 â Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and
Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36).[43] The FAA also pursues a
program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community.
[44] The FAA has set up a process to report aviation-related_noise_complaints
for anyone who may be impacted by Aircraft noise.
The Federal_Highway_Administration (FHWA) developed noise regulations to
control highway_noise as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The
regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various
land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway
traffic noise and construction noise.[45]
The Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development (HUD) noise standards as
described in 24 CFR part 51, Subpart B provides minimum national standards
applicable to HUD programs to protect citizen against excessive noise in their
communities and places of residence. For instance, all sites whose
environmental or community noise exposure exceeds the day night average sound
level (DNL) of 65 (dB) are considered noise-impacted areas, it defines
"Normally Unacceptable" noise zones where community noise levels are between
65-75 dB, for such locations, noise abatement and noise attenuation features
must be implemented. Locations where the DNL is above 75 dB are considered
"Unacceptable" and require approval by the Assistant Secretary for Community
Planning and Development.[46]
The Department_of_Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics has
created a National_Transportation_Noise_Map to provide access to comprehensive
aircraft and road noise data on national and county-level. The map aims to
assist city planners, elected officials, scholars, and residents to gain access
to up-to-date aviation and Interstate highway noise information.[47]
States and local governments typically have very specific statutes on building
codes, urban_planning, and roadway development. Noise laws and ordinances vary
widely among municipalities and indeed do not even exist in some cities. An
ordinance may contain a general prohibition against making noise that is a
nuisance, or it may set out specific guidelines for the level of noise
allowable at certain times of the day and for certain activities.[48]
New_York_City instituted the first comprehensive noise code in 1985. The
Portland Noise Code includes potential fines of up to $5000 per infraction and
is the basis for other major U.S. and Canadian city noise ordinances.[49]
