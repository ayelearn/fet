Berner Tricoil Energy Recovery System atop the Center for Sustainable
Landscapes in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Energy recovery includes any technique or method of minimizing the input of
energy to an overall system by the exchange_of_energy from one sub-system of
the overall system with another. The energy can be in any form in either
subsystem, but most energy recovery systems exchange thermal_energy in either
sensible or latent form.
In some circumstances the use of an enabling technology, either diurnal thermal
energy_storage or seasonal_thermal_energy_storage (STES, which allows heat or
cold storage between opposing seasons), is necessary to make energy recovery
practicable. One example is waste_heat from air_conditioning machinery stored
in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. Another is an STES application
at a foundry in Sweden. Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of
native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of 140 heat exchanger equipped
boreholes (155mm diameter) that are 150m deep. This store is used for heating
an adjacent factory as needed, even months later.[1] An example of using STES
to recover and utilize natural heat that otherwise would be wasted is the Drake
Landing_Solar_Community in Alberta, Canada. The community uses a cluster of
boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage, and this enables obtaining
97 percent of the year-round space heating from solar thermal collectors on the
garage roofs.[2][3] Another STES application is recovering the cold of winter
by circulating water through a dry cooling tower, and using that to chill a
deep aquifer or borehole cluster. The chill is later recovered from the storage
for summer air conditioning.[4] With a coefficient of performance (COP) of 20
to 40, this method of cooling can be ten times more efficient than conventional
air conditioning.[5]

***** Principle[edit] *****
A common application of this principle is in systems which have an exhaust
stream or waste stream which is transferred from the system to its
surroundings. Some of the energy in that flow of material (often gaseous or
liquid) may be transferred to the make-up or input material flow. This input
mass flow often comes from the system's surroundings, which, being at ambient
conditions, are at a lower temperature than the waste stream. This temperature
differential allows heat_transfer and thus energy transfer, or in this case,
recovery. Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste
streams to fresh make-up air and water intakes in buildings, such as for the
HVAC systems, or process systems.
***** System approach[edit] *****
Energy_consumption is a key part of most human activities. This consumption
involves converting_one_energy_system_to_another, for example: The conversion
of mechanical energy to electrical energy, which can then power computers,
light, motors etc. The input energy propels the work and is mostly converted to
heat or follows the product in the process as output energy. Energy recovery
systems harvest the output power and provide this as input power to the same or
another process.
An energy recovery system will close this energy_cycle to prevent the input
power from being released back to nature and rather be used in other forms of
desired work.
***** Examples[edit] *****
    * Heat recovery is implemented in heat sources like e.g. a steel_mill.
      Heated cooling_water from the process is sold for heating of homes, shops
      and offices in the surrounding area.
    * Regenerative_braking is used in electric cars, trains, heavy cranes etc.
      where the energy consumed when elevating the potential is returned to the
      electric supplier when released.
    * Active pressure reduction systems where the differential pressure in a
      pressurized fluid flow is recovered rather than converted to heat in a
      pressure reduction valve and released.

**** Electric Turbo Compound (ETC)[edit] ****
Electric_Turbo_Compound_(ETC) cross section
Main article: Electric_turbo_compound
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of
improving the fuel efficiency of gas and diesel engines by recovering waste
energy from the exhaust gases.
***** Environmental impact[edit] *****
There is a large potential for energy recovery in compact systems like large
industries and utilities. Together with energy_conservation, it should be
possible to dramatically reduce world_energy_consumption. The effect of this
will then be:
    * Reduced number of coal-fired_power_plants
    * Reduced airborne particles, NOx and CO2 â improved air quality
    * Slowing or reducing climate_change
    * Lower fuel bills on transport
    * Longer availability of crude_oil
    * Change of industries and economies not fully researched
In 2008 Tom_Casten, chairman of Recycled_Energy_Development, said that "We
think we could make about 19 to 20 percent of U.S. electricity with heat that
is currently thrown away by industry."[7]
A 2007 Department of Energy study found the potential for 135,000 megawatts of
combined_heat_and_power (which uses energy recovery) in the U.S.,[8] and a
Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts
that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP.[9] These
studies suggest that about 200,000 megawatts, or 20%, of total power capacity
could come from energy_recycling in the U.S. Widespread use of energy_recycling
could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent.[10]
Indeed, as of 2005, about 42% of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the
production of electricity and 27% from the production of heat.[11][12]
It is, however, difficult to quantify the environmental impact of a global
energy recovery implementation in some sectors. The main impediments are:
[citation_needed]
    * Lack of efficient technologies for private homes. Heat recovery systems
      in private homes can have an efficiency as low as 30% or less. It may be
      more realistic to use energy conservation like thermal_insulation or
      improved buildings. Many areas are more dependent on forced cooling and a
      system for extracting heat from dwellings to be used for other uses are
      not widely available.
    * Ineffective infrastructure. Heat recovery in particular need a short
      distance from producer to consumer to be viable. A solution may be to
      move a large consumer to the vicinity of the producer. This may have
      other complications.
    * Transport_sector is not ready. With the transport sector using about 20%
      of the energy supply, most of the energy is spent on overcoming gravity
      and friction. Electric_cars with regenerative_braking seem to be the best
      candidate for energy recovery. Wind systems on ships are under
      development. Very little work on the airline_industry is known in this
      field.
