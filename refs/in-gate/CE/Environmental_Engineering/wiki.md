Environmental engineering is a professional engineering discipline that takes
from broad scientific topics like chemistry, biology, ecology, geology,
hydraulics, hydrology, microbiology, and mathematics to create solutions that
will protect and also improves the health of living organisms and improve the
quality of the environment.[1][2] Environmental engineering is a sub-discipline
of civil_engineering and chemical_engineering.
Environmental engineering is the application of scientific and engineering
principles to improve and maintain the environment to:
    * protect human health,
    * protect nature's beneficial ecosystems,
    * and improve environmental-related enhancement of the quality of human
      life.[1]
Environmental engineers devise solutions for waste_water_management, water and
air_pollution control, recycling, waste_disposal, and public_health.[2][3] They
design municipal_water_supply and industrial_wastewater_treatment systems,[4]
[5] and design plans to prevent waterborne_diseases and improve sanitation in
urban, rural and recreational areas. They evaluate hazardous-waste_management
systems to evaluate the severity of such hazards, advise on treatment and
containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. They implement
environmental_engineering_law, as in assessing the environmental impact of
proposed construction projects.
Environmental engineers study the effect of technological advances on the
environment, addressing local and worldwide environmental issues such as acid
rain, global_warming, ozone_depletion, water pollution and air pollution from
automobile_exhausts and industrial_sources.[2][6][7][8]
Most jurisdictions impose licensing and registration requirements for qualified
environmental engineers.[9][10][11]

***** History[edit] *****
Further information: History_of_water_supply_and_sanitation
**** Ancient civilizations[edit] ****
Environmental engineering is a name for work that has been done since early
civilizations, as people learned to modify and control the environmental
conditions to meet needs.[3][12] As people recognized that their health was
related to the quality_of_their_environment, they built systems to improve it.
[3] The ancient Indus_Valley_Civilization (3300 B.C.E. to 1300 B.C.E.) had
advanced control over their water resources.[12] The public work structures
found at various sites in the area include wells, public baths,water storage
tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system.[12]
[13] They also had an early canal irrigation system enabling large-scale
agriculture.[14]
From 4000 to 2000 B.C.E., many civilizations had drainage systems and some had
sanitation facilities, including the Mesopotamian_Empire, Mohenjo-Daro, Egypt,
Crete, and the Orkney_Islands in Scotland.[3] The Greeks also had aqueducts and
sewer systems that used rain and wastewater to irrigate and fertilize fields.
[3]
The first aqueduct in Rome was constructed in 312 B.C.E., and from there, they
continued to construct aqueducts for irrigation and safe urban water supply
during droughts.[3] They also built an underground sewer system as early as the
7th century B.C.E. that fed into the Tiber River, draining marshes to create
farmland as well as removing sewage from the city.[3][12]
**** Modern era[edit] ****
Very little change was seen from the fall of Rome until the 19th century, where
improvements saw increasing efforts focused on public health.[12][15] Modern
environmental engineering began in London in the mid-19th century when Joseph
Bazalgette designed the first major sewerage system following the Great_Stink.
[12] The city's sewer system conveyed raw sewage to the River_Thames, which
also supplied the majority of the city's drinking water, leading to an outbreak
of cholera.[12] The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage
treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne_diseases from leading
causes of death to rarities.[16]
The field emerged as a separate academic discipline during the middle of the
20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and air
pollution and other environmental degradation. As society and technology grew
more complex, they increasingly produced unintended effects on the natural
environment. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide DDT to
control agricultural pests in the years following World_War_II. While the
agricultural benefits were outstanding and crop yields increased dramatically,
reducing world hunger, and malaria was controlled better than ever before, the
pesticide brought numerous bird species to the edge of extinction due to its
impact on their reproductive cycle. The story of DDT as vividly told in Rachel
Carson's Silent_Spring (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern
environmental movement,[17] which led to the modern field of "environmental
engineering."
***** Education[edit] *****
Many universities offer environmental engineering programs through either the
department of civil_engineering or chemical_engineering and also including
electronic projects to develop and balance the environmental conditions.
Environmental engineers in a civil engineering program often focus on
hydrology, water resources management, bioremediation, and water and wastewater
treatment plant design. Environmental engineers in a chemical engineering
program tend to focus on environmental chemistry, advanced air and water
treatment technologies, and separation processes.[citation_needed] Some
subdivisions of environmental engineering include natural_resources_engineering
and agricultural_engineering.
Courses for students fall into a few broad classes:
    * Mechanical_engineering courses oriented towards designing machines and
      mechanical systems for environmental use such as water and wastewater
      treatment facilities, pumping stations, garbage segregation plants, and
      other mechanical facilities.
    * Environmental engineering or environmental systems courses oriented
      towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the
      landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment.
    * Environmental_chemistry, sustainable chemistry or environmental chemical
      engineering courses oriented towards understanding the effects of
      chemicals in the environment, including any mining processes, pollutants,
      and also biochemical processes.
    * Environmental_technology courses oriented towards producing electronic or
      electrical graduates capable of developing devices and artifacts able to
      monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including
      monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable_sources.

***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Water supply and treatment[edit] ****
Environmental engineers evaluate the water balance within a watershed and
determine the available water supply, the water needed for various needs in
that watershed, the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and
they develop systems to store, treat, and convey water for various uses.
Water is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses. In the
case of a potable_water supply, water is treated to minimize the risk of
infectious_disease transmission, the risk of non-infectious illness, and to
create a palatable water flavor. Water distribution systems are designed and
built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-
user needs such as domestic use, fire suppression, and irrigation.
**** Wastewater treatment[edit] ****
Sewage_treatment plant, Australia
There are numerous wastewater_treatment technologies. A wastewater treatment
train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating
materials, a secondary treatment system consisting of an aeration basin
followed by flocculation and sedimentation or an activated_sludge system and a
secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological nitrogen removal system, and a final
disinfection process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes
organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge). The secondary
clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system,
although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove
nitrogen and phosphorus and to disinfect the water before discharge to a
surface water stream or ocean outfall.[19]
**** Air pollution management[edit] ****
Scientists have developed air_pollution_dispersion_models to evaluate the
concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality
from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue_gas_stack emissions. To some extent,
this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon_dioxide and other greenhouse
gas emissions from combustion processes.
**** Environmental impact assessment and mitigation[edit] ****
Main article: Environmental_impact_assessment
Water pollution
Environmental engineers apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate
if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality, air quality,
habitat quality, flora and fauna, agricultural capacity, traffic, ecology, and
noise. If impacts are expected, they then develop mitigation measures to limit
or prevent such impacts. An example of a mitigation measure would be the
creation of wetlands in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of
wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the
road.
In the United States, the practice of environmental assessment was formally
initiated on January 1, 1970, the effective date of the National_Environmental
Policy_Act (NEPA). Since that time, more than 100 developing and developed
nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure
used elsewhere. NEPA is applicable to all federal agencies in the United
States.[20]
***** Regulatory agencies[edit] *****
**** Environmental Protection Agency[edit] ****
The U.S._Environmental_Protection_Agency (EPA) is one of the many agencies that
work with environmental engineers to solve key issues. An important component
of EPA's mission is to protect and improve air, water, and overall
environmental quality in order to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful
effects.
