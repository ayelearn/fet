Quality control (QC) is a process by which entities review the quality of all
factors involved in production. ISO_9000 defines quality control as "A part of
quality management focused on fulfilling quality requirements".[1]
This approach places on a emphasis on three aspects (enshrined in standards
such as ISO 9001):[2][3]
   1. Elements such as controls, job management, defined and well managed
      processes,[4][5] performance and integrity criteria, and identification
      of records
   2. Competence, such as knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications
   3. Soft elements, such as personnel, integrity, confidence, organizational
      culture, motivation, team_spirit, and quality relationships.
Inspection is a major component of quality control, where physical product is
examined visually (or the end results of a service are analyzed). Product
inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable product
defects such as cracks or surface blemishes for example.[3]
The quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these three aspects is
deficient in any way.

***** History and introduction[edit] *****
See also: History_of_technology
Early stone_tools such as anvils had no holes and were not designed as
interchangeable_parts. Mass_production established processes for the creation
of parts and system with identical dimensions and design, but these processes
are not uniform and hence some customers were unsatisfied with the result.
Quality control separates the act of testing products to uncover defects from
the decision to allow or deny product release, which may be determined by
fiscal constraints.[6] For contract work, particularly work awarded by
government agencies, quality control issues are among the top reasons for not
renewing a contract.[7]
The simplest form of quality control was a sketch of the desired item. If the
sketch did not match the item, it was rejected, in a simple Go/no_go procedure.
However, manufacturers soon found it was difficult and costly to make parts be
exactly like their depiction; hence around 1840 tolerance limits were
introduced, wherein a design would function if its parts were measured to be
within the limits. Quality was thus precisely defined using devices such as
plug_gauges and ring_gauges. However, this did not address the problem of
defective items; recycling or disposing of the waste adds to the cost of
production, as does trying to reduce the defect rate. Various methods have been
proposed to prioritize quality control issues and determine whether to leave
them unaddressed or use quality_assurance techniques to improve and stabilize
production.[6]
***** Notable approaches[edit] *****
There is a tendency for individual consultants and organizations to name their
own unique approaches to quality controlâa few of these have ended up in
widespread use:

***** In project management[edit] *****
In project_management, quality control requires the project manager and/or the
project team to inspect the accomplished work to ensure its alignment with the
project scope.[14] In practice, projects typically have a dedicated quality
control team which focuses on this area.[15]
