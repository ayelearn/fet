Archaeological survey using a Leica TPS1100 total station on an Iron_Age
dwelling in Ytterby, Sweden.
A typical prism with back target. Used with survey and 3D point monitoring
systems to measure changes in elevation and position of a point.
A total station (TS) or total station theodolite (TST) is an electronic/optical
instrument used for surveying and building_construction. It is an electronic
transit theodolite integrated with electronic_distance_measurement (EDM) to
measure both vertical and horizontal angles and the slope distance from the
instrument to a particular point, and an on-board computer to collect data and
perform triangulation calculations.[1]
Robotic or motorized total stations allow the operator to control the
instrument from a distance via remote control. This eliminates the need for an
assistant staff member as the operator holds the retroreflector and controls
the total station from the observed point. These motorized total stations can
also be used in automated setups knows as Automated Motorized Total Station
(AMTS).

***** Function[edit] *****
**** Angle measurement[edit] ****
Most total station instruments measure angles by means of electro-optical
scanning of extremely precise digital bar-codes etched on rotating glass
cylinders or discs within the instrument. The best quality total stations are
capable of measuring angles to 0.5 arc-second. Inexpensive "construction grade"
total stations can generally measure angles to 5 or 10 arc-seconds.
**** Distance measurement[edit] ****
Main article: Distance_measurement
Measurement of distance is accomplished with a modulated infrared carrier
signal, generated by a small solid-state emitter within the instrument's
optical path, and reflected by a prism reflector or the object under survey.
The modulation pattern in the returning signal is read and interpreted by the
computer in the total station. The distance is determined by emitting and
receiving multiple frequencies, and determining the integer number of
wavelengths to the target for each frequency. Most total stations use purpose-
built glass prism_(surveying) reflectors for the EDM signal. A typical total
station can measure distances up to 1,500 meters (4,900 ft) with an accuracy of
about 1.5 millimeters (0.059 in) Â± 2 parts per million.[2]
Reflectorless total stations can measure distances to any object that is
reasonably light in color, up to a few hundred meters.
**** Coordinate measurement[edit] ****
The coordinates of an unknown point relative to a known coordinate can be
determined using the total station as long as a direct line of sight can be
established between the two points. Angles and distances are measured from the
total station to points under survey, and the coordinates (X, Y, and Z; or
easting, northing, and elevation) of surveyed points relative to the total
station position are calculated using trigonometry and triangulation.
To determine an absolute location, a total station requires line of sight
observations and can be set up over a known point or with line of sight to 2 or
more points with known location, called free_stationing.[3][4]
For this reason, some total stations also have a Global_Navigation_Satellite
System receiver and do not require a direct line of sight to determine
coordinates. However, GNSS measurements may require longer occupation periods
and offer relatively poor accuracy in the vertical axis.[3]
**** Data processing[edit] ****
Some models include internal electronic data storage to record distance,
horizontal angle, and vertical angle measured, while other models are equipped
to write these measurements to an external data_collector, such as a hand-held
computer.
When data is downloaded from a total station onto a computer, application
software can be used to compute results and generate a map of the surveyed
area. The newest generation of total stations can also show the map on the
touch-screen of the instrument immediately after measuring the points.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Total stations are mainly used by land_surveyors and civil_engineers, either to
record features as in topographic surveying or to set out features (such as
roads, houses or boundaries). They are also used by archaeologists to record
excavations and by police, crime scene investigators, private accident
reconstructionists and insurance companies to take measurements of scenes.
**** Mining[edit] ****
Total stations are the primary survey instrument used in mining surveying.
A total station is used to record the absolute location of the tunnel walls,
ceilings (backs), and floors as the drifts of an underground mine are driven.
The recorded data are then downloaded into a CAD_program, and compared to the
designed layout of the tunnel.
The survey party installs control stations at regular intervals. These are
small steel plugs installed in pairs in holes drilled into walls or the back.
For wall stations, two plugs are installed in opposite walls, forming a line
perpendicular to the drift. For back stations, two plugs are installed in the
back, forming a line parallel to the drift.
A set of plugs can be used to locate the total station set up in a drift or
tunnel by processing measurements to the plugs by intersection and resection.
**** Mechanical and electrical construction[edit] ****
Total stations have become the highest standard for most forms of construction
layout.[according_to_whom?]
They are most often used in the X and Y axis to lay out the locations of
penetrations out of the underground utilities into the foundation, between
floors of a structure, as well as roofing penetrations.
Because more commercial and industrial construction jobs have become centered
around building_information_modeling (BIM), the coordinates for almost every
pipe, conduit, duct and hanger support are available with digital precision.
[clarification_needed] The application of communicating a virtual model to a
tangible construction potentially eliminates labor costs related to moving
poorly measured systems, as well as time spent laying out these systems in the
midst of a full blown construction job in progress.[citation_needed]
**** Meteorology[edit] ****
Meteorologists also use total stations to track weather_balloons for
determining upper-level winds. With the average ascent rate of the weather
balloon known or assumed, the change in azimuth and elevation readings provided
by the total station as it tracks the weather balloon over time are used to
compute the wind speed and direction at different altitudes. Additionally, the
total station is used to track ceiling balloons to determine the height of
cloud layers. Such upper-level wind data is often used for aviation weather
forecasting and rocket launches.
