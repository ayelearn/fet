Fluid statics or hydrostatics is the branch of fluid_mechanics that studies
"fluids at rest and the pressure in a fluid or exerted by a fluid on an
immersed body".[1]
It encompasses the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in
stable equilibrium as opposed to fluid_dynamics, the study of fluids in motion.
Hydrostatics are categorized as a part of the fluid statics, which is the study
of all fluids, incompressible or not, at rest.
Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics, the engineering of equipment for
storing, transporting and using fluids. It is also relevant to geophysics and
astrophysics (for example, in understanding plate_tectonics and the anomalies
of the Earth's_gravitational_field), to meteorology, to medicine (in the
context of blood_pressure), and many other fields.
Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life,
such as why atmospheric_pressure changes with altitude, why wood and oil float
on water, and why the surface of still water is always level.

***** History[edit] *****
Some principles of hydrostatics have been known in an empirical and intuitive
sense since antiquity, by the builders of boats, cisterns, aqueducts and
fountains. Archimedes is credited with the discovery of Archimedes'_Principle,
which relates the buoyancy force on an object that is submerged in a fluid to
the weight of fluid displaced by the object. The Roman engineer Vitruvius
warned readers about lead pipes bursting under hydrostatic pressure.[2]
The concept of pressure and the way it is transmitted by fluids was formulated
by the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise_Pascal in 1647.
**** Hydrostatics in ancient Greece and Rome[edit] ****
*** Pythagorean Cup[edit] ***
Main article: Pythagorean_cup
The "fair cup" or Pythagorean_cup, which dates from about the 6th century BC,
is a hydraulic technology whose invention is credited to the Greek
mathematician and geometer Pythagoras. It was used as a learning tool.
The cup consists of a line carved into the interior of the cup, and a small
vertical pipe in the center of the cup that leads to the bottom. The height of
this pipe is the same as the line carved into the interior of the cup. The cup
may be filled to the line without any fluid passing into the pipe in the center
of the cup. However, when the amount of fluid exceeds this fill line, fluid
will overflow into the pipe in the center of the cup. Due to the drag that
molecules exert on one another, the cup will be emptied.
*** Heron's fountain[edit] ***
Main article: Heron's_fountain
Heron's_fountain is a device invented by Heron_of_Alexandria that consists of a
jet of fluid being fed by a reservoir of fluid. The fountain is constructed in
such a way that the height of the jet exceeds the height of the fluid in the
reservoir, apparently in violation of principles of hydrostatic pressure. The
device consisted of an opening and two containers arranged one above the other.
The intermediate pot, which was sealed, was filled with fluid, and several
cannula (a small tube for transferring fluid between vessels) connecting the
various vessels. Trapped air inside the vessels induces a jet of water out of a
nozzle, emptying all water from the intermediate reservoir.
**** Pascal's contribution in Hydrostatics[edit] ****
Main article: Pascal's_Law
Pascal made contributions to developments in both hydrostatics and
hydrodynamics. Pascal's_Law is a fundamental principle of fluid mechanics that
states that any pressure applied to the surface of a fluid is transmitted
uniformly throughout the fluid in all directions, in such a way that initial
variations in pressure are not changed.
***** Pressure in fluids at rest[edit] *****
Due to the fundamental nature of fluids, a fluid cannot remain at rest under
the presence of a shear_stress. However, fluids can exert pressure normal to
any contacting surface. If a point in the fluid is thought of as an
infinitesimally small cube, then it follows from the principles of equilibrium
that the pressure on every side of this unit of fluid must be equal. If this
were not the case, the fluid would move in the direction of the resulting
force. Thus, the pressure on a fluid at rest is isotropic; i.e., it acts with
equal magnitude in all directions. This characteristic allows fluids to
transmit force through the length of pipes or tubes; i.e., a force applied to a
fluid in a pipe is transmitted, via the fluid, to the other end of the pipe.
This principle was first formulated, in a slightly extended form, by Blaise
Pascal, and is now called Pascal's_law.
**** Hydrostatic pressure[edit] ****
See also: Vertical_pressure_variation
In a fluid at rest, all frictional and inertial stresses vanish and the state
of stress of the system is called hydrostatic. When this condition of V = 0 is
applied to the Navier-Stokes_equation, the gradient of pressure becomes a
function of body forces only. For a barotropic_fluid in a conservative force
field like a gravitational force field, pressure exerted by a fluid at
equilibrium becomes a function of force exerted by gravity.
The hydrostatic pressure can be determined from a control volume analysis of an
infinitesimally small cube of fluid. Since pressure is defined as the force
exerted on a test area (p = F/A, with p: pressure, F: force normal to area A,
A: area), and the only force acting on any such small cube of fluid is the
weight of the fluid column above it, hydrostatic pressure can be calculated
according to the following formula:
         p ( z ) &#x2212; p (  z  0   ) =   1 A    &#x222B;   z  0     z   d  z
      &#x2032;   &#x222C;  A   d  x &#x2032;  d  y &#x2032;   &#x03C1; (  z
      &#x2032;  ) g (  z &#x2032;  ) =  &#x222B;   z  0     z   d  z &#x2032;
      &#x03C1; (  z &#x2032;  ) g (  z &#x2032;  ) ,   {\displaystyle p(z)-p(z_
      {0})={\frac {1}{A}}\int _{z_{0}}^{z}dz'\iint _{A}dx'dy'\,\rho (z')g
      (z')=\int _{z_{0}}^{z}dz'\,\rho (z')g(z'),}  [{\displaystyle p(z)-p(z_
      {0})={\frac {1}{A}}\int _{z_{0}}^{z}dz'\iint _{A}dx'dy'\,\rho (z')g
      (z')=\int _{z_{0}}^{z}dz'\,\rho (z')g(z'),}]
where:
    * p is the hydrostatic pressure (Pa),
    * Ï is the fluid density (kg/m3),
    * g is gravitational acceleration (m/s2),
    * A is the test area (m2),
    * z is the height (parallel to the direction of gravity) of the test area
      (m),
    * z0 is the height of the zero_reference_point_of_the_pressure (m).
For water and other liquids, this integral can be simplified significantly for
many practical applications, based on the following two assumptions: Since many
liquids can be considered incompressible, a reasonable good estimation can be
made from assuming a constant density throughout the liquid. (The same
assumption cannot be made within a gaseous environment.) Also, since the height
h of the fluid column between z and z0 is often reasonably small compared to
the radius of the Earth, one can neglect the variation of g. Under these
circumstances, the integral is simplified into the formula:
         p &#x2212;  p  0   = &#x03C1; g h ,   {\displaystyle p-p_{0}=\rho gh,}
      [{\displaystyle p-p_{0}=\rho gh,}]
where h is the height z â z0 of the liquid column between the test volume and
the zero reference point of the pressure. This formula is often called Stevin's
law.[3][4] Note that this reference point should lie at or below the surface of
the liquid. Otherwise, one has to split the integral into two (or more) terms
with the constant Ïliquid and Ï(zâ²)above. For example, the absolute
pressure compared to vacuum is:
         p = &#x03C1; g H +  p   a t m    ,   {\displaystyle p=\rho gH+p_
      {\mathrm {atm} },}  [{\displaystyle p=\rho gH+p_{\mathrm {atm} },}]
where H is the total height of the liquid column above the test area to the
surface, and patm is the atmospheric_pressure, i.e., the pressure calculated
from the remaining integral over the air column from the liquid surface to
infinity. This can easily be visualized using a pressure_prism.
Hydrostatic pressure has been used in the preservation of foods in a process
called pascalization.[5]
**** Medicine[edit] ****
In medicine, hydrostatic pressure in blood_vessels is the pressure of the blood
against the wall. It is the opposing force to oncotic_pressure.
**** Atmospheric pressure[edit] ****
Statistical_mechanics shows that, for a gas of constant temperature, T, its
pressure, p will vary with height, h, as:
         p ( h ) = p ( 0 )  e  &#x2212;    M g h   k T        {\displaystyle p
      (h)=p(0)e^{-{\frac {Mgh}{kT}}}}  [{\displaystyle p(h)=p(0)e^{-{\frac
      {Mgh}{kT}}}}]
where:
    * g is the acceleration_due_to_gravity
    * T is the absolute_temperature
    * k is Boltzmann_constant
    * M is the mass of a single molecule of gas
    * p is the pressure
    * h is the height
This is known as the barometric_formula, and may be derived from assuming the
pressure is hydrostatic.
If there are multiple types of molecules in the gas, the partial_pressure of
each type will be given by this equation. Under most conditions, the
distribution of each species of gas is independent of the other species.
**** Buoyancy[edit] ****
Main article: Buoyancy
Any body of arbitrary shape which is immersed, partly or fully, in a fluid will
experience the action of a net force in the opposite direction of the local
pressure gradient. If this pressure gradient arises from gravity, the net force
is in the vertical direction opposite that of the gravitational force. This
vertical force is termed buoyancy or buoyant force and is equal in magnitude,
but opposite in direction, to the weight of the displaced fluid.
Mathematically,
         F = &#x03C1; g V   {\displaystyle F=\rho gV}  [F = \rho g V ]
where Ï is the density of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and
V is the volume of fluid directly above the curved surface.[6] In the case of a
ship, for instance, its weight is balanced by pressure forces from the
surrounding water, allowing it to float. If more cargo is loaded onto the ship,
it would sink more into the water â displacing more water and thus receive a
higher buoyant force to balance the increased weight.
Discovery of the principle of buoyancy is attributed to Archimedes.
**** Hydrostatic force on submerged surfaces[edit] ****
The horizontal and vertical components of the hydrostatic force acting on a
submerged surface are given by the following:[6]
              F   h       =  p   c    A      F   v       = &#x03C1; g V
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F_{\mathrm {h} }&=p_{\mathrm {c} }A\\F_
      {\mathrm {v} }&=\rho gV\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin
      {aligned}F_{\mathrm {h} }&=p_{\mathrm {c} }A\\F_{\mathrm {v} }&=\rho
      gV\end{aligned}}}]
where:
    * pc is the pressure at the centroid of the vertical projection of the
      submerged surface
    * A is the area of the same vertical projection of the surface
    * Ï is the density of the fluid
    * g is the acceleration due to gravity
    * V is the volume of fluid directly above the curved surface
***** Liquids (fluids with free surfaces)[edit] *****
Liquids can have free surfaces at which they interface with gases, or with a
vacuum. In general, the lack of the ability to sustain a shear_stress entails
that free surfaces rapidly adjust towards an equilibrium. However, on small
length scales, there is an important balancing force from surface_tension.
**** Capillary action[edit] ****
When liquids are constrained in vessels whose dimensions are small, compared to
the relevant length scales, surface_tension effects become important leading to
the formation of a meniscus through capillary_action. This capillary action has
profound consequences for biological systems as it is part of one of the two
driving mechanisms of the flow of water in plant xylem, the transpirational
pull.
**** Hanging drops[edit] ****
Without surface tension, drops would not be able to form. The dimensions and
stability of drops are determined by surface tension. The drop's surface
tension is directly proportional to the cohesion property of the fluid.
