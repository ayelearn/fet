Ground vibrations is a technical term that is being used to describe mostly
man-made vibrations of the ground, in contrast to natural vibrations of the
Earth studied by seismology. For example, vibrations caused by explosions,
construction works, railway and road transport, etc. - all belong to ground
vibrations.

***** General information[edit] *****
In seismology, ground vibrations are associated with different types of elastic
waves propagating through the ground. These are surface_waves, mostly Rayleigh
waves, and bulk longitudinal_waves and transverse_waves (or shear waves)
propagating into the ground depth. Typical frequency range for environmental
ground vibrations is 1 â 200 Hz. Waves of lower frequencies (below 1 Hz) are
usually called microseisms, and they are normally associated with natural
phenomenae, e.g. water_waves in the oceans. Environmental ground vibrations
generated by rail and road traffic may cause annoyance to residents of nearby
buildings both directly and via generated structure-borne interior noise. Very
strong ground vibrations, e.g. generated by heavy lorries on bumped roads, may
even cause structural damage to very close buildings. Magnitudes of ground
vibrations are usually described in terms of particle vibration velocity (in
mm/s or m/s). Sometimes they are also described in decibels (relative to the
reference particle velocity of 10â9 m/s). Typical values of ground vibration
particle velocity associated with vehicles passing over traffic calming road
humps are in the range of 0.1 â 2 mm/s. Magnitudes of ground vibrations that
are considered to be able to cause structural damage to buildings are above
10â20 mm/s.
***** Ground vibrations from railways[edit] *****
The main sources of ground vibrations generated by railway trains are dynamic
forces transmitted from tracks to the ground. These forces are associated with
complex processes of interaction of moving train axles with railway tracks
supported by the elastic ground. The magnitudes of these forces generally
increase with the increase of train speeds. Therefore, the levels of generated
ground vibrations may be substantial in the case of high-speed trains. If a
train speed becomes larger than Rayleigh wave velocity in the ground, an
additional very large increase in generated ground vibrations takes place. This
phenomenon is termed ground_vibration_boom, and it is similar to sonic_boom
generated by supersonic aircraft.
***** Ground vibrations from road traffic[edit] *****
The main mechanism responsible for generation of ground vibrations by moving
cars and lorries is the dynamic forces associated with vehicle passage over
road irregularities, such as bumps, peats, etc. These forces, and hence
generated ground vibrations, can be reduced by keeping road surfaces in good
condition.
***** Ground vibrations at construction[edit] *****
The main sources of ground vibrations at construction are pile driving, dynamic
compaction, blasting, and operation of heavy construction equipment. These
vibrations may harmfully affect surrounding buildings, and their effect ranges
from disturbance of residents to visible structural damage.
