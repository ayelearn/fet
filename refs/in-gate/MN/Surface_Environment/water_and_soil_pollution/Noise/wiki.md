This article is about noise as an unwanted acoustic phenomenon. For the general
signal phenomenon, see Noise_(spectral_phenomenon). For other uses, see Noise_
(disambiguation).
NASA researchers at Glenn_Research_Center conducting tests on aircraft_engine
noise in 1967
Noise is unwanted sound judged to be unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing.
From a physics standpoint, noise is indistinguishable from sound, as both are
vibrations through a medium, such as air or water. The difference arises when
the brain receives and perceives a sound.[1][2]
Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g.,
music or speech) or unintended. In contrast, noise_in_electronics may not be
audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection.[3]
In audio_engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise
signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss. This signal noise is
commonly measured using A-weighting[4] or ITU-R_468_weighting.[5]
In experimental_sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data
that hinders perception of a signal.[6][7]

***** Measurement[edit] *****
Sound is measured[8] based on the amplitude and frequency of a sound wave.
Amplitude measures how forceful the wave is. The energy in a sound wave is
measured in decibels_(dB), the measure of loudness, or intensity of a sound;
this measurement describes the amplitude of a sound wave. Decibels_(dB) are
expressed in a logarithmic_scale. On the other hand, pitch describes the
frequency of a sound and is measured in hertz_(Hz).[9]
The main instrument to measure sounds in the air is the Sound_Level_Meter.
There are many different varieties of instruments that are used to measure
noise - Noise_Dosimeters are often used in occupational environments, noise
monitors are used to measure environmental noise and noise_pollution, and
recently smartphone-based sound level meter applications (apps)[10] are being
used to crowdsource and map recreational and community noise.[11][12][13]
A-weighting is applied to a sound spectrum to represent the sound that humans
are capable of hearing at each frequency. Sound pressure is thus expressed in
terms of dBA. 0 dBA is the softest level that a person can hear. Normal
speaking voices are around 65 dBA. A rock concert can be about 120 dBA.
***** Recording and reproduction[edit] *****
In audio, recording, and broadcast systems, audio noise refers to the residual
low-level sound (four major types: hiss, rumble, crackle, and hum) that is
heard in quiet periods of program. This variation from the expected pure sound
or silence can be caused by the audio recording equipment, the instrument, or
ambient noise in the recording room.[14]
In audio_engineering it can refer either to the acoustic noise from
loudspeakers or to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives
rise to acoustic noise heard as 'hiss'. This signal noise is commonly measured
using A-weighting or ITU-R_468_weighting
Noise is often generated deliberately and used as a test_signal for audio
recording and reproduction equipment.
***** White noise[edit] *****
Main article: White_noise
 White_Noise
==============================================================================
Problems playing this file? See media_help.
White noise is energy randomly spread across a wide frequency band containing
all notes from high to low. It is called "white" noise as it is analogous to
"white" light which contains all the colors of the visible spectrum.[15]
***** Environmental noise[edit] *****
Main article: Environmental_noise
Environmental_noise is the accumulation of all noise present in a specified
environment. The principal sources of environmental noise are surface motor
vehicles, aircraft, trains and industrial sources.[16] These noise sources
expose millions of people to noise_pollution that creates not only annoyance,
but also significant health consequences such as elevated incidence of hearing
loss and cardiovascular disease.[17] There are a variety of mitigation
strategies and controls available to reduce sound levels including source
intensity reduction, land-use_planning strategies, noise_barriers and sound
baffles, time of day use regimens, vehicle operational controls and
architectural_acoustics design measures.
***** Regulation[edit] *****
Main article: Noise_regulation
Certain geographic areas or specific occupations may be at a higher risk of
being exposed to constantly high levels of noise; in order to prevent negative
health outcomes, regulations may be set. Noise regulation includes statutes or
guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or
provincial and municipal levels of government. Environmental noise is governed
by laws and standards which set maximum recommended levels of noise for
specific land uses, such as residential areas, areas of outstanding natural
beauty, or schools. These standards usually specify measurement using a
weighting_filter, most often A-weighting.[18][19]
**** United States[edit] ****
In 1972, the Noise_Control_Act was passed to promote a healthy living
environment for all Americans, where noise does not pose a threat to human
health. This policy's main objectives were: (1) establish coordination of
research in the area of noise_control, (2) establish federal standards on noise
emission for commercial products, and (3) promote public awareness about noise
emission and reduction.[20][21]
The Quiet_Communities_Act_of_1978 promotes noise control programs at the state
and local level and developed a research program on noise control.[22] Both
laws authorized the Environmental_Protection_Agency to study the effects of
noise and evaluate regulations regarding noise control.[23]
The National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health (NIOSH) provides
recommendation on noise exposure in the workplace.[24][25] In 1972 (revised in
1998), NIOSH published a document outlining recommended standards relating to
the occupational exposure to noise, with the purpose of reducing the risk of
developing permanent hearing loss related to exposure at work.[26] This
publication set the recommended exposure limit (REL) of noise in an occupation
setting to 85 dBA for 8 hours using a 3-dB exchange rate (every 3-dB increase
in level, duration of exposure should be cut in half, i.e. 88 dBA for 4 hours,
91 dBA for 2 hours, 94 dBA for 1 hour, etc.). However, in 1973 the Occupational
Safety_and_Health_Administration (OSHA) maintained the requirement of an 8-hour
average of 90 dBA. The following year, OSHA required employers to provide a
hearing_conservation_program to workers exposed to 85 dBA average 8-hour
workdays.[27]
**** Europe[edit] ****
The European_Environment_Agency regulates noise control and surveillance within
the European_Union.[28] The Environmental_Noise_Directive was set to determine
levels of noise exposure, increase public access to information regarding
environmental noise, and reduce environmental noise.[29][30] Additionally, in
the European Union, underwater noise is a pollutant according to the Marine
Strategy_Framework_Directive (MSFD).[31] The MSFD requires EU Member_States to
achieve or maintain Good_Environmental_Status, meaning that the "introduction
of energy, including underwater noise, is at levels that do not adversely
affect the marine environment".[31]
***** Health effects[edit] *****
Main articles: Health_effects_from_noise and Noise-induced_hearing_loss
Earplugs can be used to protect the user's ears from loud noises.
Exposure to noise is associated with several negative health outcomes.
Depending on duration and level of exposure, noise may cause or increase the
likelihood of hearing_loss, high_blood_pressure, ischemic_heart_disease, sleep
disturbances, injuries, and even decreased school performance.[32] There are
also causal relationships between noise and psychological effects such as
annoyance, psychiatric disorders, and effects on psychosocial well-being.[32]
Noise exposure has increasingly been identified as a public_health issue,
especially in an occupational setting, as demonstrated with the creation of
NIOSH's Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention program.[33] Noise has also proven to
be an occupational_hazard, as it is the most common work-related pollutant.[34]
Noise-induced hearing loss, when associated with noise exposure at the
workplace is also called occupational_hearing_loss.
**** Hearing loss prevention[edit] ****
While noise-induced_hearing_loss is permanent, it is also preventable.[35]
Particularly in the workplace, regulations may exist limiting permissible
exposure_limit to noise. This can be especially important for professionals
working in settings with consistent exposure to loud sounds, such as musicians,
music teachers and audio_engineers.[36] Examples of measures taken to prevent
noise-induced hearing loss in the workplace include engineering noise control,
the Buy-Quiet initiative,[37][38] creation of the Safe-In-Sound_award, and
noise surveillance.[39]
***** Literary views[edit] *****
Roland_Barthes distinguishes between physiological noise, which is merely
heard, and psychological noise, which is actively listened_to. Physiological
noise is felt subconsciously as the vibrations of the noise (sound) waves
physically interact with the body while psychological noise is perceived as our
conscious awareness shifts its attention to that noise.[40]
Luigi_Russolo, one of the first composers of noise_music,[41] wrote the essay
The_Art_of_Noises. He argues that any kind of noise could be used as music, as
audiences become more familiar with noises caused by technological
advancements; noise has become so prominent that pure sound no longer exists.
[42]
Henry_Cowell claims that technological advancements have reduced unwanted
noises from machines, but have not managed so far to completely eliminate them.
