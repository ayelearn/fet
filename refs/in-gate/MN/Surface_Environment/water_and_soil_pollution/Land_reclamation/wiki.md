Reclaiming in Perth, Australia 1964
Land reclamation, usually known as reclamation, and also known as land fill
(not to be confused with a landfill), is the process of creating new land from
oceans, riverbeds, or lake_beds. The land reclaimed is known as reclamation
ground or land fill.
In a number of other jurisdictions, including parts of the United_States,[1]
the term "reclamation" can refer to returning disturbed lands to an improved
state. In Alberta, Canada, for example, reclamation is defined by the
provincial government as "The process of reconverting disturbed land to its
former or other productive uses."[2] In Oceania it is frequently referred to as
land_rehabilitation.

***** Methods[edit] *****
Land reclamation can be achieved with a number of different methods. The most
simple method involves filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock and/or
cement, then filling with clay and dirt until the desired height is reached.
The process is called "infilling"[3] and the material used to fill the space is
generally called "infill".[4][5] Draining of submerged wetlands is often used
to reclaim land for agricultural use. Deep_cement_mixing is used typically in
situations in which the material displaced by either dredging or draining may
be contaminated and hence needs to be contained. Land dredging is also another
method of land reclamation. It is the removal of sediments and debris from the
bottom of a body of water. It is commonly used for maintaining reclaimed land
masses as sedimentation, a natural process, fills channels and harbors
naturally.[6]
***** Habitation[edit] *****
East_Coast_Park in Singapore was built on reclaimed land with a man-made beach.
The Flevopolder in the Netherlands, reclaimed from the IJsselmeer, is the
largest reclaimed artificial_island in the world.
Land Reclamation in the Beirut_Central_District
The whole district of Fontvieille, Monaco was reclaimed from the sea
Instances where the creation of new land was for the need of human_activities.
Notable examples include:
**** Asia[edit] ****
    * The whole 3 sq. km. business district of Cebu_South_Road_Properties in
      Cebu_City, Philippines
    * Some of the coastlines of Saadiyat_Island, in the UAE. Used for
      commercial purposes.[7]
    * Much of the coastlines of Mumbai, India. It took over 150 years to join
      the original Seven_Islands_of_Bombay. These seven islands were lush,
      green, thickly wooded, and dotted with 22 hills, with the Arabian_Sea
      washing through them at high tide. The original Isle_of_Bombay was only
      24 km long and 4 km wide from Dongri to Malabar_Hill (at its broadest
      point) and the other six were Colaba, Old_Woman's_Island, Mahim, Parel,
      Worli and Mazgaon. (See also Hornby_Vellard).[8]
    * Much of the coastlines of Mainland_China, Hong_Kong, North_Korea and

One of the earliest large scale projects was the Beemster_Polder in the
Netherlands, realized in 1612 adding 70 square kilometres (27 sq mi) of land.
In Hong Kong the Praya_Reclamation_Scheme added 20 to 24 hectares (50 to 60
acres) of land in 1890 during the second phase of construction. It was one of
the most ambitious projects ever taken during the Colonial_Hong_Kong era.[14]
Some 20% of land in the Tokyo_Bay area has been reclaimed,[15] most notably
Odaiba artificial island. Le_Portier, Monaco and Gibraltar are also expanding
due to land reclamation. The city of Rio_de_Janeiro was largely built on
reclaimed land, as was Wellington, New_Zealand.
Artificial_islands are an example of land reclamation. Creating an artificial
island is an expensive and risky undertaking. It is often considered in places
with high population density and a scarcity of flat land. Kansai_International
Airport (in Osaka) and Hong_Kong_International_Airport are examples where this
process was deemed necessary. The Palm_Islands, The_World and hotel Burj_al-
Arab off Dubai in the United_Arab_Emirates are other examples of artificial
islands (although there is yet no real "scarcity of land" in Dubai), as well as
the Flevopolder in the Netherlands which is the largest artificial island in
the world.
***** Agriculture[edit] *****
Land reclamation in progress in Bingzhou (ä¸å·) Peninsula (formerly, island)
of the Dongzui Bay (ä¸åæ¸¯). Tong'an_District, Xiamen, China
Agriculture was a drive for land reclamation before industrialisation.[16] In
South China, farmers reclaimed paddy_fields by enclosing an area with a stone
wall on the sea_shore near a river_mouth or river_delta. The species of rice
that grow on these grounds are more salt tolerant. Another use of such enclosed
land is the creation of fish_ponds. It is commonly seen on the Pearl_River
Delta and Hong_Kong. These reclaimed areas also attract species of migrating
birds.
A related practice is the draining of swampy or seasonally submerged wetlands
to convert them to farmland. While this does not create new land exactly, it
allows commercially productive use of land that would otherwise be restricted
to wildlife habitat. It is also an important method of mosquito_control.
Even in the post-industrial age, there have been land reclamation projects
intended for increasing available agricultural land. For example, the village
of Ogata in Akita,_Japan, was established on land reclaimed from Lake
HachirÅgata (Japan's second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By
1977, the amount of land reclaimed totalled 172.03 square kilometres
(66.42 sq mi).[17]
***** Beach restoration[edit] *****
Main article: Beach_nourishment
Beach rebuilding is the process of repairing beaches using materials such as
sand or mud from inland. This can be used to build up beaches suffering from
beach_starvation or erosion from longshore_drift. It stops the movement of the
original beach material through longshore drift and retains a natural look to
the beach. Although it is not a long-lasting solution, it is cheap compared to
other types of coastal_defences. An example of this is the city of Mumbai.[8]
***** Landfill[edit] *****
As human_overcrowding_of_developed_areas intensified during the 20th century,
it has become important to develop land re-use strategies for completed
landfills. Some of the most common usages are for parks, golf_courses and other
sports fields. Increasingly, however, office buildings and industrial uses are
made on a completed landfill. In these latter uses, methane_capture is
customarily carried out to minimize explosive hazard within the building.
An example of a Class_A_office_building constructed over a landfill is the
Dakin_Building at Sierra_Point, Brisbane,_California. The underlying fill was
deposited from 1965 to 1985, mostly consisting of construction debris from San
Francisco and some municipal wastes. Aerial_photographs prior to 1965 show this
area to be tidelands of the San Francisco Bay. A clay cap was constructed over
the debris prior to building approval.[18]
A notable example is Sydney_Olympic_Park, the primary venue for the 2000 Summer
Olympic Games, which was built atop an industrial wasteland that included
landfills.
Another strategy for landfill is the incineration of landfill trash at high
temperature via the plasma-arc_gasification_process, which is currently used at
two facilities in Japan, and will be used at a planned facility in St._Lucie
County, Florida.[19]
***** Environmental impact[edit] *****
Parts (highlighted in brown) of the San_Francisco_Bay were reclaimed from
wetlands for urban use.
Draining wetlands for ploughing, for example, is a form of habitat_destruction.
In some parts of the world, new reclamation projects are restricted or no
longer allowed, due to environmental_protection laws. Reclamation projects have
strong negative impacts on coastal populations, although some species can take
advantage of the newly created area.[20]
**** Environmental legislation[edit] ****
A map of reclaimed land in Hong Kong: Grey (built), red (proposed or under
development). Many of the urban areas of Hong Kong are on reclaimed land.
The State of California created a state commission, the San_Francisco_Bay
Conservation_and_Development_Commission, in 1965 to protect San Francisco Bay
and regulate development near its shores. The commission was created in
response to growing concern over the shrinking size of the bay.
Hong Kong legislators passed the Protection_of_the_Harbour_Ordinance, proposed
by the Society_for_Protection_of_the_Harbour, in 1997 in an effort to safeguard
the increasingly threatened Victoria_Harbour against encroaching land
development.[21] Several large reclamation schemes at Green Island, West
Kowloon, and Kowloon_Bay were subsequently shelved, and others reduced in size.
***** Dangers[edit] *****
Reclaimed land is highly susceptible to soil_liquefaction during earthquakes,
[22] which can amplify the amount of damage that occurs to buildings and
infrastructure. Subsidence is another issue, both from soil_compaction on
filled land, and also when wetlands are enclosed by levees and drained to
create Polders. Drained marshes will eventually sink below the surrounding
water level, increasing the danger from flooding.
***** Land amounts added[edit] *****
    * Bangladesh â about 110 square kilometres (42 sq mi) in total and has
      12,000 square kilometres (4,600 sq mi) potential (8% of total area) up to
      12 metres (39 ft) depth in the territorial sea area.[23]
    * Netherlands â (Main article: Land_reclamation_in_the_Netherlands)
      about 1/6 (almost 17%) of the entire country, or about 7,000 square
      kilometres (2,700 sq mi) in total, has been reclaimed from the sea,
      lakes, marshes and swamps. The province of Flevoland has almost
      completely been reclaimed from the Zuiderzee.
    * South_Korea â As of 2006, 38 percent or 1,550 square kilometres
      (600 sq mi) of coastal wetlands reclaimed, including 400 square
      kilometres (150 sq mi) at Saemangeum. Songdo_International_Business
      district, the largest private development in history, is a large-scale
      reclamation project built entirely on tidal mudflats.
    * Singapore â 20 percent of the original size or 135 square kilometres
      (52 sq mi). As of 2003[update], plans for 99 square kilometres (38 sq mi)
      more are to go ahead,[24] despite the fact that disputes persist with
      Malaysia over Singapore's extensive land reclamation works.[25] Parts of
      Singapore Airport are also on reclaimed land.
    * Hong_Kong â (Main article: Land_reclamation_in_Hong_Kong)
      Praya_Reclamation_Scheme began in the late 1860s and consisted of two
      stages totaling 20 to 24 hectares (50 to 60 acres).[14] Hong_Kong
      Disneyland, Hong_Kong_International_Airport, and its predecessor, Kai_Tak
      Airport, were all built on reclaimed land. In addition, much reclamation
      has taken place in prime locations on the waterfront on both sides of
      Victoria_Harbour. This has raised environmental issues of the protection
      of the harbour which was once the source of prosperity of Hong Kong,
      traffic congestion in the Central_district,[26] as well as the collusion
      of the Hong Kong Government with the real_estate developers in the
      territory.[27][28]
      In addition, as the city expands, new towns in different decades were
      mostly built on reclaimed land, such as Tuen_Mun, Tai_Po, Shatin-Ma_On
      Shan, West_Kowloon, Kwun_Tong and Tseung_Kwan_O.
    * Macau â 170% of the original size or 17 square kilometres (6.6 sq mi)
      [29]
    * Jakarta, Indonesia â Giant_Sea_Wall_Jakarta is part of a massive
      coastal development project at Jakarta Bay, Indonesia.
    * Manila_Bay, Philippines â additional 626 hectares along the eastern
      coast of Manila Bay created in the 1990s[30] to the 88-hectare Cultural
      Center_of_the_Philippines Complex. The shore road of Manila (Roxas
      Boulevard) is actually reclaimed land, as well as its extension road to
      Cavite (Manila-Cavite_Expressway_/_Aguinaldo_Boulevard).
    * Cebu_South_Road_Properties, Cebu_City, Philippines - Artificial island
      which is 300 hectares was built along the sea between Mainland Cebu and
      Kawit Island. This was done to address the increasing need of urban and
      residential development in Cebu_City due to its very progressive economy.
    * Mumbai, India â An archipelago of originally seven_separate_islands
      were joined together by land reclamation over a span of five centuries.
      This was done to develop Mumbai as a harbour city.
    * Monaco â 0.41 square kilometres (0.16 sq mi) out of 2.05 square
      kilometres (0.79 sq mi), or one fifth of Monaco comes from land taken
      from the sea, mainly in the neighborhoods of Fontvieille, La_Condamine,
      and Larvotto/Bas_Moulins.
    * Tokyo_Bay, Japan â 249 square kilometres (96 sq mi)[31] including the
      entirety of Odaiba artificial_island.
    * Kobe,_Japan â 23 square kilometres (8.9 sq mi) (1995).
    * Bahrain â 76.3% of original size of 410 square kilometres (160 sq mi)
      (1931â2007).[citation_needed][32]
    * New_Zealand â significant areas of land totalling several hundred
      hectares have been reclaimed along the harbourfronts of Auckland,
      Wellington and Dunedin. In Dunedin â which in its early days was
      nicknamed "Mudedin" â around 2.5 square kilometres (0.97 sq mi),
      including much of the inner city and suburbs of Dunedin North, South
      Dunedin and Andersons Bay is reclaimed from the Otago Harbour, and a
      similar area in the suburbs of St Clair and St Kilda is reclaimed
      swampland. The international airports serving Auckland and Wellington
      have had significant reclamation for runway use.[33][34]
    * United_Arab_Emirates â Dubai has a total of four reclaimed islands (the
      Palm_Jumeirah, Jebal Ali, The Burj_al_Arab Island, and The_World
      Islands), with a fifth under construction (the Palm_Deira). There are
      several man made islands in Abu_Dhabi, such as Yas_Island and Al_Lulu
      Island.
