Systems engineering techniques are used in complex projects: spacecraft design,
computer chip design, robotics, software integration, and bridge building.
Systems engineering uses a host of tools that include modeling_and_simulation,
requirements analysis and scheduling to manage complexity.
Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and
engineering_management that focuses on how to design and manage complex_systems
over their life_cycles. At its core, systems engineering utilizes systems
thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge. The individual outcome
of such efforts, an engineered system, can be defined as a combination of
components that work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function.
Issues such as requirements_engineering, reliability, logistics, coordination
of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other
disciplines necessary for successful system development, design,
implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing
with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes,
optimization methods, and risk_management tools in such projects. It overlaps
technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial_engineering,
mechanical_engineering, manufacturing_engineering, control_engineering,
software_engineering, electrical_engineering, cybernetics, organizational
studies, civil_engineering and project_management. Systems engineering ensures
that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated
into a whole.
The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a
manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive
activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The
systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that
need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact
failures that can occur â systems engineering involves finding solutions to
these problems.

***** History[edit] *****
QFD House_of_Quality for Enterprise Product Development Processes
The term systems engineering can be traced back to Bell_Telephone_Laboratories
in the 1940s.[1] The need to identify and manipulate the properties of a system
as a whole, which in complex engineering projects may greatly differ from the
sum of the parts' properties, motivated various industries, especially those
developing systems for the U.S. Military, to apply the discipline.[2]
When it was no longer possible to rely on design evolution to improve upon a
system and the existing tools were not sufficient to meet growing demands, new
methods began to be developed that addressed the complexity directly.[3] The
continuing evolution of systems engineering comprises the development and
identification of new methods and modeling techniques. These methods aid in a
better comprehension of the design and developmental control of engineering
systems as they grow more complex. Popular tools that are often used in the
systems engineering context were developed during these times, including USL,
UML, QFD, and IDEF0.
In 1990, a professional society for systems engineering, the National Council
on Systems Engineering (NCOSE), was founded by representatives from a number of
U.S. corporations and organizations. NCOSE was created to address the need for
improvements in systems engineering practices and education. As a result of
growing involvement from systems engineers outside of the U.S., the name of the
organization was changed to the International_Council_on_Systems_Engineering
(INCOSE) in 1995.[4] Schools in several countries offer graduate programs in
systems engineering, and continuing_education options are also available for
practicing engineers.[5]

***** Concept[edit] *****
Some definitions
Simon_Ramo considered by some to be a founder of modern systems engineering
defined the discipline as:"...a branch of engineering which concentrates on the
design and application of the whole as distinct from the parts, looking at a
problem in its entirety, taking account of all the facets and all the variables
and linking the social to the technological."[6] — Conquering Complexity, 2004.
"An interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful
systems"[7] — INCOSE handbook, 2004.
"System engineering is a robust approach to the design, creation, and operation
of systems. In simple terms, the approach consists of identification and
quantification of system goals, creation of alternative system design concepts,
performance of design trades, selection and implementation of the best design,
verification that the design is properly built and integrated, and post-
implementation assessment of how well the system meets (or met) the goals."[8] —
NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, 1995.
"The Art and Science of creating effective systems, using whole system, whole
life principles" OR "The Art and Science of creating optimal solution systems to
complex issues and problems"[9] — Derek Hitchins, Prof. of Systems Engineering,
former president of INCOSE (UK), 2007.
"The concept from the engineering standpoint is the evolution of the engineering
scientist, i.e., the scientific generalist who maintains a broad outlook. The
method is that of the team approach. On large-scale-system problems, teams of
scientists and engineers, generalists as well as specialists, exert their joint
efforts to find a solution and physically realize it...The technique has been
variously called the systems approach or the team development method."[10] —
Harry H. Goode & Robert E. Machol, 1957.
"The systems engineering method recognizes each system is an integrated whole
even though composed of diverse, specialized structures and sub-functions. It
further recognizes that any system has a number of objectives and that the
balance between them may differ widely from system to system. The methods seek to
optimize the overall system functions according to the weighted objectives and to
achieve maximum compatibility of its parts."[11] — Systems Engineering Tools by
Harold Chestnut, 1965.
Systems engineering signifies only an approach and, more recently, a discipline
in engineering. The aim of education in systems engineering is to formalize
various approaches simply and in doing so, identify new methods and research
opportunities similar to that which occurs in other fields of engineering. As
an approach, systems engineering is holistic and interdisciplinary in flavour.
**** Origins and traditional scope[edit] ****
The traditional scope of engineering embraces the conception, design,
development, production and operation of physical systems. Systems engineering,
as originally conceived, falls within this scope. "Systems engineering", in
this sense of the term, refers to the building of engineering concepts.
**** Evolution to broader scope[edit] ****
The use of the term "systems engineer" has evolved over time to embrace a
wider, more holistic concept of "systems" and of engineering processes. This
evolution of the definition has been a subject of ongoing controversy,[12] and
the term continues to apply to both the narrower and broader scope.
Traditional systems engineering was seen as a branch of engineering in the
classical sense, that is, as applied only to physical systems, such as
spacecraft and aircraft. More recently, systems engineering has evolved to a
take on a broader meaning especially when humans were seen as an essential
component of a system. Checkland, for example, captures the broader meaning of
systems engineering by stating that 'engineering' "can be read in its general
sense; you can engineer a meeting or a political agreement."[13]:10
Consistent with the broader scope of systems engineering, the Systems
Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)[14] has defined three types of systems
engineering: (1) Product Systems Engineering (PSE) is the traditional systems
engineering focused on the design of physical systems consisting of hardware
and software. (2) Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) pertains to the view of
enterprises, that is, organizations or combinations of organizations, as
systems. (3) Service Systems Engineering (SSE) has to do with the engineering
of service systems. Checkland[13] defines a service system as a system which is
conceived as serving another system. Most civil infrastructure systems are
service systems.
**** Holistic view[edit] ****
Systems engineering focuses on analyzing and eliciting customer needs and
required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting
requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while
considering the complete problem, the system_lifecycle. This includes fully
understanding all of the stakeholders involved. Oliver et al. claim that the
systems engineering process can be decomposed into
    * a Systems Engineering Technical Process, and
    * a Systems Engineering Management Process.
Within Oliver's model, the goal of the Management Process is to organize the
technical effort in the lifecycle, while the Technical Process includes
assessing available information, defining effectiveness measures, to create a
behavior model, create a structure model, perform trade-off analysis, and
create sequential build & test plan.[15]
Depending on their application, although there are several models that are used
in the industry, all of them aim to identify the relation between the various
stages mentioned above and incorporate feedback. Examples of such models
include the Waterfall_model and the VEE_model.[16]
**** Interdisciplinary field[edit] ****
System development often requires contribution from diverse technical
disciplines.[17] By providing a systems (holistic) view of the development
effort, systems engineering helps mold all the technical contributors into a
unified team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds
from concept to production to operation and, in some cases, to termination and
disposal. In an acquisition, the holistic integrative discipline combines
contributions and balances tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and performance
while maintaining an acceptable level of risk covering the entire life cycle of
the item.[18]
This perspective is often replicated in educational programs, in that systems
engineering courses are taught by faculty from other engineering departments,
which helps create an interdisciplinary environment.[19][20]
**** Managing complexity[edit] ****
The need for systems engineering arose with the increase in complexity of
systems and projects,[21][22] in turn exponentially increasing the possibility
of component friction, and therefore the unreliability of the design. When
speaking in this context, complexity incorporates not only engineering systems,
but also the logical human organization of data. At the same time, a system can
become more complex due to an increase in size as well as with an increase in
the amount of data, variables, or the number of fields that are involved in the
design. The International_Space_Station is an example of such a system.
The International_Space_Station is an example of a very complex system
requiring Systems Engineering.
The development of smarter control algorithms, microprocessor design, and
analysis of environmental systems also come within the purview of systems
engineering. Systems engineering encourages the use of tools and methods to
better comprehend and manage complexity in systems. Some examples of these
tools can be seen here:[23]
    * System_architecture,
    * System_model, Modeling, and Simulation,
    * Optimization,
    * System_dynamics,
    * Systems_analysis,
    * Statistical_analysis,
    * Reliability_analysis, and
    * Decision_making
Taking an interdisciplinary approach to engineering systems is inherently
complex since the behavior of and interaction among system components is not
always immediately well_defined or understood. Defining and characterizing such
systems and subsystems and the interactions among them is one of the goals of
systems engineering. In doing so, the gap that exists between informal
requirements from users, operators, marketing organizations, and technical
specifications is successfully bridged.
**** Scope[edit] ****
The scope of systems engineering activities[24]
One way to understand the motivation behind systems engineering is to see it as
a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within a
wide variety of systems.[citation_needed] Keeping this in mind, the principles
of systems engineering – holism, emergent behavior, boundary, et al. – can be
applied to any system, complex or otherwise, provided systems_thinking is
employed at all levels.[25] Besides defense and aerospace, many information and
technology based companies, software development firms, and industries in the
field of electronics & communications require systems engineers as part of
their team.[26]
An analysis by the INCOSE Systems Engineering center of excellence (SECOE)
indicates that optimal effort spent on systems engineering is about 15-20% of
the total project effort.[27] At the same time, studies have shown that systems
engineering essentially leads to reduction in costs among other benefits.[27]
However, no quantitative survey at a larger scale encompassing a wide variety
of industries has been conducted until recently. Such studies are underway to
determine the effectiveness and quantify the benefits of systems engineering.
[28][29]
Systems engineering encourages the use of modeling_and_simulation to validate
assumptions or theories on systems and the interactions within them.[30][31]
Use of methods that allow early detection of possible failures, in safety
engineering, are integrated into the design process. At the same time,
decisions made at the beginning of a project whose consequences are not clearly
understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it
is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make
critical decisions. No method guarantees today's decisions will still be valid
when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived.
However, there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering.
Examples include soft systems methodology, Jay_Wright_Forrester's System
dynamics method, and the Unified_Modeling_Language (UML)âall currently being
explored, evaluated, and developed to support the engineering decision process.
***** Education[edit] *****
Main article: List_of_systems_engineering_at_universities
Education in systems engineering is often seen as an extension to the regular
engineering courses,[32] reflecting the industry attitude that engineering
students need a foundational background in one of the traditional engineering
disciplines (e.g., aerospace_engineering, civil_engineering, electrical
engineering, mechanical_engineering, manufacturing_engineering, industrial
engineering)âplus practical, real-world experience to be effective as systems
engineers. Undergraduate university programs explicitly in systems engineering
are growing in number but remain uncommon, the degrees including such material
most often presented as a BS in Industrial Engineering. Typically programs
(either by themselves or in combination with interdisciplinary study) are
offered beginning at the graduate level in both academic and professional
tracks, resulting in the grant of either a MS/MEng or Ph.D./EngD degree.
INCOSE, in collaboration with the Systems Engineering Research Center at
Stevens_Institute_of_Technology maintains a regularly updated directory of
worldwide academic programs at suitably accredited institutions.[5] As of 2017,
it lists over 140 universities in North America offering more than 400
undergraduate and graduate programs in systems engineering. Widespread
institutional acknowledgment of the field as a distinct subdiscipline is quite
recent; the 2009 edition of the same publication reported the number of such
schools and programs at only 80 and 165, respectively.
Education in systems engineering can be taken as Systems-centric or Domain-
centric:
    * Systems-centric programs treat systems engineering as a separate
      discipline and most of the courses are taught focusing on systems
      engineering principles and practice.
    * Domain-centric programs offer systems engineering as an option that can
      be exercised with another major field in engineering.
Both of these patterns strive to educate the systems engineer who is able to
oversee interdisciplinary projects with the depth required of a core-engineer.
[33]
***** Systems engineering topics[edit] *****
Systems engineering tools are strategies, procedures, and techniques that aid
in performing systems engineering on a project or product. The purpose of these
tools vary from database management, graphical browsing, simulation, and
reasoning, to document production, neutral import/export and more.[34]
**** System[edit] ****
There are many definitions of what a system is in the field of systems
engineering. Below are a few authoritative definitions:
    * ANSI/EIA-632-1999: "An aggregation of end products and enabling products
      to achieve a given purpose."[35]
    * DAU Systems Engineering Fundamentals: "an integrated composite of people,
      products, and processes that provide a capability to satisfy a stated
      need or objective."
    * IEEE Std 1220-1998: "A set or arrangement of elements and processes that
      are related and whose behavior satisfies customer/operational needs and
      provides for life cycle sustainment of the products."[36]
    * INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook: "homogeneous entity that exhibits
      predefined behavior in the real world and is composed of heterogeneous
      parts that do not individually exhibit that behavior and an integrated
      configuration of components and/or subsystems."[37]
    * INCOSE: "A system is a construct or collection of different elements that
      together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone. The
      elements, or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities,
      policies, and documents; that is, all things required to produce systems-
      level results. The results include system level qualities, properties,
      characteristics, functions, behavior and performance. The value added by
      the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the
      parts, is primarily created by the relationship among the parts; that is,
      how they are interconnected."[38]
    * ISO/IEC 15288:2008: "A combination of interacting elements organized to
      achieve one or more stated purposes."[39]
    * NASA Systems Engineering Handbook: "(1) The combination of elements that
      function together to produce the capability to meet a need. The elements
      include all hardware, software, equipment, facilities, personnel,
      processes, and procedures needed for this purpose. (2) The end product
      (which performs operational functions) and enabling products (which
      provide life-cycle support services to the operational end products) that
      make up a system."[40]
**** The systems engineering process[edit] ****
The systems engineering process encompasses all creative, manual and technical
activities necessary to define the product and which need to be carried out to
convert a system definition to a sufficiently detailed system design
specification for product manufacture and deployment. Design and development of
a system can be divided into four stages, each with different definitions:[41]
    * task definition (informative definition),
    * conceptual stage (cardinal definition),
    * design stage (formative definition), and
    * implementation stage (manufacturing definition).
Depending on their application, tools are used for various stages of the
systems engineering process:[24]
      [Systems_Engineering_Process.jpg]
**** Using models[edit] ****
Models play important and diverse roles in systems engineering. A model can be
defined in several ways, including:[42]
    * An abstraction of reality designed to answer specific questions about the
      real world
    * An imitation, analogue, or representation of a real world process or
      structure; or
    * A conceptual, mathematical, or physical tool to assist a decision maker.
Together, these definitions are broad enough to encompass physical engineering
models used in the verification of a system design, as well as schematic models
like a functional_flow_block_diagram and mathematical (i.e., quantitative)
models used in the trade study process. This section focuses on the last.[42]
The main reason for using mathematical_models and diagrams in trade studies is
to provide estimates of system effectiveness, performance or technical
attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a
collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome
variables. The heart of any mathematical model is a set of meaningful
quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships
can be as simple as adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as
complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a
spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express
causality, not just correlation.[42] Furthermore, key to successful systems
engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are
efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However,
diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for
systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods
among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of
'Modeling & Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.[43]
**** Modeling formalisms and graphical representations[edit] ****
Initially, when the primary purpose of a systems engineer is to comprehend a
complex problem, graphic representations of a system are used to communicate a
system's functional and data requirements.[44] Common graphical representations
include:
    * Functional_flow_block_diagram (FFBD)
    * Model-based_design
    * Data_flow_diagram (DFD)
    * N2_chart
    * IDEF0_diagram
    * Use_case_diagram
    * Sequence_diagram
    * Block_diagram
    * Signal-flow_graph
    * USL_function_maps_and_type_maps
    * Enterprise_architecture_frameworks
    * Model-based_systems_engineering
A graphical representation relates the various subsystems or parts of a system
through functions, data, or interfaces. Any or each of the above methods are
used in an industry based on its requirements. For instance, the N2 chart may
be used where interfaces between systems is important. Part of the design phase
is to create structural and behavioral models of the system.
Once the requirements are understood, it is now the responsibility of a systems
engineer to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best
technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems
engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best
option. A decision_matrix, or Pugh method, is one way (QFD is another) to make
this choice while considering all criteria that are important. The trade study
in turn informs the design, which again affects graphic representations of the
system (without changing the requirements). In an SE process, this stage
represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is
found. A decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as
statistical analysis, reliability analysis, system dynamics (feedback control),
and optimization methods.
**** Other tools[edit] ****
Systems_Modeling_Language (SysML), a modeling language used for systems
engineering applications, supports the specification, analysis, design,
verification and validation of a broad range of complex systems.[45]
Lifecycle_Modeling_Language (LML), is an open-standard modeling language
designed for systems engineering that supports the full lifecycle: conceptual,
utilization, support and retirement stages.[46]
***** Related fields and sub-fields[edit] *****
Many related fields may be considered tightly coupled to systems engineering.
The following areas have contributed to the development of systems engineering
as a distinct entity:
  Cognitive systems engineering
      Cognitive systems engineering (CSE) is a specific approach to the
      description and analysis of human-machine systems or sociotechnical
      systems.[47] The three main themes of CSE are how humans cope with
      complexity, how work is accomplished by the use of artifacts, and how
      human-machine systems and socio-technical systems can be described as
      joint cognitive systems. CSE has since its beginning become a recognized
      scientific discipline, sometimes also referred to as cognitive
      engineering. The concept of a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) has in
      particular become widely used as a way of understanding how complex
      socio-technical systems can be described with varying degrees of
      resolution. The more than 20 years of experience with CSE has been
      described extensively.[48][49]
  Configuration management
      Like systems engineering, configuration_management as practiced in the
      defense and aerospace_industry is a broad systems-level practice. The
      field parallels the taskings of systems engineering; where systems
      engineering deals with requirements development, allocation to
      development items and verification, configuration management deals with
      requirements capture, traceability to the development item, and audit of
      development item to ensure that it has achieved the desired functionality
      that systems engineering and/or Test and Verification Engineering have
      proven out through objective testing.
  Control engineering
      Control_engineering and its design and implementation of control_systems,
      used extensively in nearly every industry, is a large sub-field of
      systems engineering. The cruise control on an automobile and the guidance
      system for a ballistic missile are two examples. Control systems theory
      is an active field of applied mathematics involving the investigation of
      solution spaces and the development of new methods for the analysis of
      the control process.
  Industrial engineering
      Industrial_engineering is a branch of engineering that concerns the
      development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated
      systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy,
      material and process. Industrial engineering draws upon the principles
      and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as
      mathematical, physical and social sciences together with the principles
      and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify, predict, and
      evaluate results obtained from such systems.
  Interface design
      Interface_design and its specification are concerned with assuring that
      the pieces of a system connect and inter-operate with other parts of the
      system and with external systems as necessary. Interface design also
      includes assuring that system interfaces be able to accept new features,
      including mechanical, electrical and logical interfaces, including
      reserved wires, plug-space, command codes and bits in communication
      protocols. This is known as extensibility. Human-Computer_Interaction
      (HCI) or Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is another aspect of interface
      design, and is a critical aspect of modern systems engineering. Systems
      engineering principles are applied in the design_of_network_protocols for
      local-area_networks and wide-area_networks.
  Mechatronic engineering
      Mechatronic_engineering, like systems engineering, is a multidisciplinary
      field of engineering that uses dynamical systems modeling to express
      tangible constructs. In that regard it is almost indistinguishable from
      Systems Engineering, but what sets it apart is the focus on smaller
      details rather than larger generalizations and relationships. As such,
      both fields are distinguished by the scope of their projects rather than
      the methodology of their practice.
  Operations research
      Operations_research supports systems engineering. The tools of operations
      research are used in systems analysis, decision making, and trade
      studies. Several schools_teach_SE_courses within the operations_research
      or industrial_engineering department,[citation_needed] highlighting the
      role systems engineering plays in complex projects. Operations_research,
      briefly, is concerned with the optimization of a process under multiple
      constraints.[50]
  Performance engineering
      Performance_engineering is the discipline of ensuring a system meets
      customer expectations for performance throughout its life. Performance is
      usually defined as the speed with which a certain operation is executed,
      or the capability of executing a number of such operations in a unit of
      time. Performance may be degraded when operations queued to execute is
      throttled by limited system capacity. For example, the performance of a
      packet-switched_network is characterized by the end-to-end packet transit
      delay, or the number of packets switched in an hour. The design of high-
      performance systems uses analytical or simulation modeling, whereas the
      delivery of high-performance implementation involves thorough performance
      testing. Performance engineering relies heavily on statistics, queueing
      theory and probability_theory for its tools and processes.
  Program management and project management
      Program_management (or programme management) has many similarities with
      systems engineering, but has broader-based origins than the engineering
      ones of systems engineering. Project_management is also closely related
      to both program management and systems engineering.
  Proposal engineering
      Proposal engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical
      principles to design, construct, and operate a cost-effective proposal
      development system. Basically, proposal engineering uses the "systems
      engineering_process" to create a cost effective proposal and increase the
      odds of a successful proposal.
  Reliability engineering
      Reliability_engineering is the discipline of ensuring a system meets
      customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does
      not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure, it
      is just as much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering
      applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with
      maintainability, availability (dependability or RAMS preferred by some),
      and logistics_engineering. Reliability engineering is always a critical
      component of safety engineering, as in failure_modes_and_effects_analysis
      (FMEA) and hazard_fault_tree analysis, and of security_engineering.
  Risk Management
      Risk_Management, the practice of assessing and dealing with risk is one
      of the interdisciplinary parts of Systems Engineering. In development,
      acquisition, or operational activities, the inclusion of risk in tradeoff
      with cost, schedule, and performance features, involves the iterative
      complex configuration management of traceability and evaluation to the
      scheduling and requirements management across domains and for the system
      lifecycle that requires the interdisciplinary technical approach of
      systems engineering. Systems Engineering has Risk Management define,
      tailor, implement, and monitor a structured process for risk management
      which is integrated to the overall effort.[51]
  Safety engineering
      The techniques of safety_engineering may be applied by non-specialist
      engineers in designing complex systems to minimize the probability of
      safety-critical failures. The "System Safety Engineering" function helps
      to identify "safety hazards" in emerging designs, and may assist with
      techniques to "mitigate" the effects of (potentially) hazardous
      conditions that cannot be designed out of systems.
  Scheduling
      Scheduling is one of the systems engineering support tools as a practice
      and item in assessing interdisciplinary concerns under configuration
      management. In particular the direct relationship of resources,
      performance features, and risk to duration of a task or the dependency
      links among tasks and impacts across the system_lifecycle are systems
      engineering concerns.
  Security engineering
      Security_engineering can be viewed as an interdisciplinary field that
      integrates the community_of_practice for control systems design,
      reliability, safety and systems engineering. It may involve such sub-
      specialties as authentication of system users, system targets and others:
      people, objects and processes.
  Software engineering
      From its beginnings, software_engineering has helped shape modern systems
      engineering practice. The techniques used in the handling of the
      complexities of large software-intensive systems have had a major effect
      on the shaping and reshaping of the tools, methods and processes of
      Software Engineering.
