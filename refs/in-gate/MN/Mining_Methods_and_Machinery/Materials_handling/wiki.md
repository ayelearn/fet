Material handling equipment (MHE) is mechanical equipment used for the
movement, storage, control and protection of materials, goods and products
throughout the process of manufacturing, distribution, consumption and
disposal.[1] The different types of handling equipment can be classified into
four major categories:[2] transport equipment, positioning equipment, unit load
formation equipment, and storage equipment.

***** Transport equipment[edit] *****
Transport equipment is used to move material from one location to another
(e.g., between workplaces, between a loading dock and a storage area, etc.),
while positioning equipment is used to manipulate material at a single
location.[3] The major subcategories of transport equipment are conveyors,
cranes, and industrial trucks. Material can also be transported manually using
no equipment.
Difference between use of conveyors, cranes, and industrial trucks for
transport with respect to their path and area of operation.
**** Conveyors[edit] ****
Conveyors are used when material is to be moved frequently between specific
points over a fixed path and when there is a sufficient flow volume to justify
the fixed conveyor investment.[4] Different types of conveyors can be
characterized by the type of product being handled: unit load or bulk load; the
conveyorâs location: in-floor, on-floor, or overhead, and whether or not
loads can accumulateon the conveyor. Accumulation allows intermittent movement
of each unit of material transported along the conveyor, while all units move
simultaneously on conveyors without accumulation capability.[5] For example,
while both the roller and flat-belt are unit-load on-floor conveyors, the
roller provides accumulation capability while the flat-belt does not;
similarly, both the power-and-free and trolley are unit-load overhead
conveyors, with the power-and-free designed to include an extra track in order
to provide the accumulation capability lacking in the trolley conveyor.
Examples of bulk-handling conveyors include the magnetic-belt, troughed-belt,
bucket, and screw conveyors. A sortation conveyor system is used for merging,
identifying, inducting, and separating products to be conveyed to specific
destinations, and typically consists of flat-belt, roller, and chute conveyor
segments together with various moveable arms and/or pop-up wheels and chains
that deflect, push, or pull products to different destinations.[6]
**** Electric Tugs[edit] ****
An electric_tug is a small battery powered and pedestrian operated machine
capable of either pushing or pulling a significantly heavier load than itself.
Traction and load control are achieved through weight transfer. Weight_transfer
is the principle of adding balance to the machine either through hydraulic
action or leverage. There are different types of tugs available alongside the
standard electric tug this includes a pusher tug and a Tow Tug. A pusher Tug is
a battery powered pedestrian machine which is designed through using a powerful
drive motor to push a wheeled load significantly heavier than itself on either
railâs castors, air skates or wheels and contact on the load is made via a
push plate. A tow tug is a weighed machine designed specifically for pulling
heavy loads significant heaver on rails wheels, castors or air skates with
occasional push movement if required. Additional features determine where the
machine can be used and in what circumstances. Electric tugs can be used in any
circumstance when assistance is needed to move a load both indoors and
outdoors, primarily in the manufacturing environment. They can reduce non-value
added time which directly results in the reduction of PAKT time through the
reduced time of moving equipment improving both safety and efficiency.
**** Cranes[edit] ****
Jib crane
Cranes are used to transport loads over variable (horizontal and vertical)
paths within a restricted area and when there is insufficient (or intermittent)
flow volume such that the use of a conveyor cannot be justified. Cranes provide
more flexibility in movement than conveyors because the loads handled can be
more varied with respect to their shape and weight. Cranes provide less
flexibility in movement than industrial trucks because they only can operate
within a restricted area, though some can operate on a portable base. Most
cranes utilize trolley-and-tracks for horizontal movement and hoists for
vertical movement, although manipulators can be used if precise positioning of
the load is required. The most common cranes include the jib, bridge, gantry,
and stacker cranes.
**** Industrial trucks[edit] ****
Pallet jack
Industrial trucks are trucks that are not licensed to travel on public roads
(commercial trucks are licensed to travel on public roads[7]). Industrial
trucks are used to move materials over variable paths and when there is
insufficient (or intermittent) flow volume such that the use of a conveyor
cannot be justified. They provide more flexibility in movement than conveyors
and cranes because there are no restrictions on the area covered, and they
provide vertical movement if the truck has lifting capabilities. Different
types of industrial trucks can be characterized by whether or not they have
forks for handling pallets, provide poweredor require manuallifting and travel
capabilities, allow the operator to rideon the truck or require that the
operator walkwith the truck during travel, provide load stacking capability,
and whether or not they can operate in narrow aisles.
Unit load AGV
Hand trucks (including carts and dollies), the simplest type of industrial
truck, cannot transport or stack pallets, is non-powered, and requires the
operator to walk. A pallet jack, which cannot stack a pallet, uses front wheels
mounted inside the end of forks that extend to the floor as the pallet is only
lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel.[8] A counterbalanced
lift truck (sometimes referred to as a forklift_truck, but other attachments
besides forks can be used) can transport and stack pallets and allows the
operator to ride on the truck. The weight of the vehicle (and operator) behind
the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of
vehicle beyond front wheels); the front wheels act as a fulcrum or pivot point.
Narrow-aisle trucks usually require that the operator stand-up while riding in
order to reduce the truckâs turning radius. Reach mechanisms and outrigger
arms that straddle and support a load can be used in addition to the just the
counterbalance of the truck. On a turret truck, the forks rotate during
stacking, eliminating the need for the truck itself to turn in narrow aisles.
An order picker allows the operator to be lifted with the load to allow for
less-than-pallet-load picking. Automated_guided_vehicles (AGVs) are industrial
trucks that can transport loads without requiring a human operator.
***** Positioning equipment[edit] *****
Positioning equipment is used to handle material at a single location. It can
be used at a workplace to feed, orient, load/unload, or otherwise manipulate
materials so that are in the correct position for subsequent handling,
machining, transport, or storage. As compared to manual handling, the use of
positioning equipment can raise the productivity of each worker when the
frequency of handling is high, improve product quality and limit damage to
materials and equipment when the item handled is heavy or awkward to hold and
damage is likely through human_error or inattention, and can reduce fatigue and
injuries when the environment is hazardous or inaccessible.[9] In many cases,
positioning equipment is required for and can be justified by the ergonomic
requirements of a task. Examples of positioning equipment include lift/tilt/
turn tables, hoists, balancers, manipulators, and industrial_robots.
Manipulators act as âmuscle multipliersâ by counterbalancing the weight of
a load so that an operator lifts only a small portion (1%) of the loadâs
weight, and they fill the gap between hoists and industrial robots: they can be
used for a wider range of positioning tasks than hoists and are more flexible
than industrial robots due to their use of manual control.[10] They can be
powered manually, electrically, or pneumatically, and a manipulatorâs end-
effector can be equipped with mechanical grippers, vacuum grippers,
electromechanical grippers, or other tooling.
***** Unit load formation equipment[edit] *****
Four-way pallet
Unit load formation equipment is used to restrict materials so that they
maintain their integrity when handled a single load during transport and for
storage. If materials are self-restraining (e.g., a single part or interlocking
parts), then they can be formed into a unit load with no equipment. Examples of
unit load formation equipment include pallets, skids, slipsheets, tote pans,
bins/baskets, cartons, bags, and crates. A pallet is a platform made of wood
(the most common), paper, plastic, rubber, or metal with enough clearance
beneath its top surface (or face) to enable the insertion of forks for
subsequent lifting purposes.[11] A slipsheet is a thick piece of paper,
corrugated fiber, or plastic upon which a load is placed and has tabs that can
be grabbed by special push/pull lift truck attachments. They are used in place
of a pallet to reduce weight and volume, but loading/unloading is slower.
***** Storage equipment[edit] *****
Single-deep pallet racks
Vertical carousel
Storage equipment is used for holding or buffering materials over a period of
time. The design of each type of storage equipment, along with its use in
warehouse design, represents a trade-off between minimizing handling costs, by
making material easily accessible, and maximizing the utilization of space (or
cube).[12] If materials are stacked directly on the floor, then no storage
equipment is required, but, on average, each different item in storage will
have a stack only half full; to increase cube utilization, storage racks can be
used to allow multiple stacks of different items to occupy the same floor space
at different levels. The use of racks becomes preferable to floor storage as
the number of units per item requiring storage decreases. Similarly, the depth
at which units of an item are stored affects cube utilization in proportion to
the number of units per item requiring storage.
Pallets can be stored using single- and double-deep racks when the number of
units per item is small, while pallet-flow and push-back racks are used when
the units per item are mid-range, and floor-storage or drive-in racks are used
when the number of units per item is large, with drive-in providing support for
pallet loads that cannot be stacked on top of each other. Individual cartons
can either be picked from pallet loads or can be stored in carton-flow racks,
which are designed to allow first-in, first-out (FIFO) carton access. For
individual piece storage, bin shelving, storage drawers, carousels, and A-
frames can be used. An automatic_storage/retrieval_system (AS/RS) is an
integrated computer-controlled storage system that combines storage medium,
transport mechanism, and controls with various levels of automation for fast
and accurate random storage of products and materials.[13]
