Longwall mining
Longwall mining is a form of underground coal_mining where a long wall of coal
is mined in a single slice (typically 0.6â1.0 m thick). The longwall panel
(the block of coal that is being mined) is typically 3â4 km long and
250â400 m wide.

***** History[edit] *****
Plan of longwall mine before conveyors â the hoist is at the center of the
central pillar.
The basic idea of longwall mining was developed in England in the late 17th
century. Miners undercut the coal along the width of the coal face, removing
coal as it fell, and used wooden props to control the fall of the roof behind
the face. This was known as the Shropshire method of mining.[1] While the
technology has changed considerably, the basic idea remains the same, to remove
essentially all of the coal from a broad coal face and allow the roof and
overlying rock to collapse into the void behind, while maintaining a safe
working space along the face for the miners.

Starting around 1900, mechanization was applied to this method. By 1940, some
referred to longwall mining as "the conveyor method" of mining, after the most
prominent piece of machinery involved.[2] Unlike earlier longwall mining, the
use of a conveyor_belt parallel to the coal face forced the face to be
developed along a straight line. The only other machinery used was an electric
cutter to undercut the coal face and electric drills for blasting to drop the
face. Once dropped, manual labor was used to load coal on to the conveyor
parallel to the face and to place wooden roof props to control the fall of the
roof.
Such low-technology longwall mines continued in operation into the 1970s. The
best known example was the New Gladstone Mine near Centerville,_Iowa, "one of
the last advancing longwall mines in the United States".[3] This longwall mine
did not use a conveyor belt, instead relying on ponies to haul coal tubs from
the face to the slope where a hoist hauled the tubs to the surface.[4][5]
Longwall mining has been extensively used as the final stage in mining old room
and_pillar mines. In this context, longwall mining can be classified as a form
of retreat_mining.
***** Layout[edit] *****
Gate roads are driven to the back of each panel before longwall mining begins.
The gate road along one side of the block is called the maingate or headgate;
the road on the other side is called the tailgate. Where the thickness of the
coal allows, these gate roads have been previously developed by continuous
miner units, as the longwall itself is not capable of the initial development.
The layout of Longwall could be either "advancing" type or of "retreat" type.
In the advancing type, the gate roads are formed as the coal face advances. In
thinner seams the advancing longwall mining method may be used. In the retreat
type, the panel is a face connecting them both. Only the maingate road is
formed in advance of the face. The tailgate road is formed behind the coal face
by removing the stone above coal height to form a roadway that is high enough
to travel in. The end of the block that includes the longwall equipment is
called the face. The other end of the block is usually one of the main travel
roads of the mine. The cavity behind the longwall is called the goaf, goff or
gob.[6]
***** Ventilation[edit] *****
Typically, intake (fresh) air travels up the main gate, across the face, and
then down the tail gate, known as 'U' type ventilation. Once past the face the
air is no longer fresh air, but return air carrying away coal_dust and mine
gases such as methane, carbon_dioxide, depending on the geology of the coal.
Return air is extracted by ventilation fans mounted on the surface. Other
ventilation methods can be used where intake air also passes the main gate and
into a bleeder or back return road reducing gas emissions from the goaf on to
the face, or intake air travels up the tail gate and across the face in the
same direction as the face chain in a homotropal system.[7]
To avoid spontaneous combustion of coal in the goaf area, gases may be allowed
to build up behind seals so as to exclude oxygen from the sealed goaf area.
Where a goaf may contain an explosive mixture of methane and oxygen, nitrogen
injection/inertisation may be used to exclude oxygen or push the explosive
mixture deep into the goaf where there are no probable ignition sources. Seals
are required to be monitored each shift by a certified mine supervisor for
damage and leaks of harmful gases.[citation_needed]
***** Equipment[edit] *****
Hydraulic chocks
A number of hydraulic_jacks, called powered roof supports, chocks or shields,
which are typically 1.75 m wide and placed in a long line, side by side for up
to 400 m in length in order to support the roof of the coalface. An individual
chock can weigh 30â40 tonnes, extend to a maximum cutting height of up to 6 m
and have yield rating of 1000â1250 tonnes each, and hydraulically advance
itself 1 m at a time.
Hydraulic chocks, conveyor and shearer
The coal is cut from the coalface by a machine called the shearer (power
loader). This machine can weigh 75â120 tonnes typically and comprises a main
body, housing the electrical functions, the tractive motive units to move the
shearer along the coalface and pumping units (to power both hydraulic and water
functions). At either end of the main body are fitted the ranging arms which
can be ranged vertically up down by means of hydraulic rams, and on to which
are mounted the shearer cutting drums which are fitted with 40â60 cutting
picks. Within the ranging arms are housed very powerful electric motors
(typically up to 850 kW) which transfer their power through a series of lay
gears within the body and through the arms to the drum mounting locations at
the extreme ends of the ranging arms where the cutting drums are. The cutting
drums are rotated at a speed of 20â50 revs/min to cut the mineral from coal
seam.
Chocks providing support to allow shearer to work
The shearer is carried along the length of the face on the armoured face
conveyor (AFC); using a chain-less haulage system, which resembles a ruggedised
rack_and_pinion system specially developed for mining. Prior to the chainless
haulage systems, haulage systems with Chain were popular, where a heavy duty
chain was run along the length of the coal face for the shearer to pull itself
along. The shearer moves at a speed of 10â30 m/min depending on cutting
conditions.
The AFC is placed in front of the powered roof supports, and the shearing
action of the rotating drums cutting into the coal seam disintegrates the coal,
this being loaded on to the AFC. The coal is removed from the coal face by a
scraper_chain_conveyor to the main gate. Here it is loaded on to a network of
conveyor belts for transport to the surface. At the main gate the coal is
usually reduced in size in a crusher, and loaded on to the first conveyor belt
by the beam stage loader (BSL).
As the shearer removes the coal, the AFC is snaked over behind the shearer and
the powered roof supports move forward into the newly created cavity. As mining
progresses and the entire longwall progresses through the seam, the goaf
increases. This goaf collapses under the weight of the overlying strata. The
strata approximately 2.5 times the thickness of the coal seam removed collapses
and the beds above settle on to the collapsed goaf. This collapsing can lower
surface height, causing problems such as changing the course of rivers and
severely damaging building foundations.[8]
***** Comparison with room and pillar method[edit] *****
Longwall and room and pillar methods of mining can both be used for mining
suitable underground coal seams. Longwall has better resource_recovery (about
80% compared with about 60% for room_and_pillar method,[9] fewer roof support
consumables are needed, higher volume coal clearance systems, minimal manual
handling and safety of the miners is enhanced by the fact that they are always
under the hydraulic roof supports when they are extracting coal.[9]
***** Automation[edit] *****
Longwall mining has traditionally been a manual process in which alignment of
the face equipment was done with string lines. Technologies have been developed
which automates several aspects of the longwall mining operation, including a
system that aligns the face of the retreating longwall panel perpendicularly to
the gate-roads.
Briefly, Inertial_navigation_system outputs are used in a dead_reckoning
calculation to estimate the shearer positions. Optimal Kalman_filters and
smoothers can be applied to improve the dead reckoning estimates prior to
repositioning the longwall equipment at the completion of each shear.[10]
Expectation-maximization_algorithms can be used to estimate the unknown filter
and smoother parameters for tracking the longwall shearer positions.[11]
Compared to manual control of the mine equipment, the automated system yields
improved production rates. In addition to productivity gains, automating
longwall equipment leads to safety benefits. The coalface is a hazardous area
because methane and carbon monoxide are present, while the area is hot and
humid since water is sprayed over the face to minimize the likelihood of sparks
occurring when the shearer picks strike rock. By automating manual processes,
face workers can be removed from these hazardous areas.[citation_needed]
***** Environmental impacts[edit] *****
As with many mining techniques, it is important to consider the local and
regional environmental impacts from longwall mining.
**** Subsidence[edit] ****
Longwall Mine Subsidence (LWMS) is an anthropogenic process that has many
ecological and environmental impacts, particularly on soil health and water
movement in a region where LWMS is heavily done. This is important to consider
as some longwall mine sites can span lengths of several kilometers. That being
said, hydrological flow systems, root systems from trees, and vegetative
species can suffer from the amounts of soil being removed beneath them, and
these stresses lead to surface erosion.[12]
Abandoned mines are also an issue with regards to areas where residential
development has moved in. Houses erected near to abandoned longwall mines face
the threat of future damage from sinkholes and poor soil quality, even up to
thirty years after mine abandonment.[13]
Since longwall mining is namely, very long, it can effect areas of over 200
acres. Over these largest spans, it has been observed that longwall mines
underlying mountain sides demonstrate more visible subsidence in mountain
landscapes than it does for valley landscapes.[13]
There have been cases of surface subsidence altering the landscape above the
mines. At Newstan Colliery in New_South_Wales, Australia "the surface has
dropped by as much as five metres in places" above a multi level mine.[14] In
some cases the subsidence causes damage to natural features such as drainage to
water courses[15] or man-made structures such as roads and buildings. "Douglas
Park Drive was closed for four weeks because longwall panels ... destabilised
the road. In 2000, the State Government stopped mining when it came within 600
metres from the twin bridges. A year later there were reports of 40-centimetre
gaps appearing in the road, and the bridge had to be jacked sideways to realign
it."[15]:2
A 2005 geotechnical report commissioned by the NSW RTA warns that "subsidence
could happen suddenly and occur over many years".[15]
However, there are several mines, which were successfully mined with little to
no measurable surface subsidence including mines under lakes, oceans, important
water catchments and environmentally sensitive areas.[citation_needed]
Subsidence is minimised by increasing the block's adjacent chain pillar widths,
decreasing extracted block widths and heights, and by giving consideration to
the depth of cover as well as competency and thickness of overlying strata.
**** Fracturing and water quality[edit] ****
Longwall mining can result in geological disruptions in the rockbed, and can in
turn effect water movement and result in water moving away from the surface,
through the mined area, and into the aquifer. A resulting loss in surface water
can negatively impact riparian ecosystems.[16]
On top of this, if there are present dams near to the longwall mining site,
this could doubly impact the riparian_ecosystems as it would have a reduced
inflow rate as well as the loss to the underlying rock fracturing.[16]
As of 2014, measures were taken by the Australian government to mitigate water
impacts from longwall mining. Legislative assemblies have called for action to
improve mine infrastructure to minimize disturbances.[17]
As a result of bedrock cracking from mining beneath waters such as lakes or
rivers, there have been groundwater losses of varying extents. Mines within a
few hundred meters of the surface are susceptible to receiving great inputs of
water from these bodies. Moreover, after mining interference disturbing the
natural landscape near the mines, the natural water flow paths can be
redirected which results in additional erosion across a stream or river bank.
Additional mining in concentrated areas continuously move these water flow
paths, which take years to return to their original states.[18]
**** Ecosystem impacts[edit] ****
Many ecosystems rely on the annual consistency of water inputs and outputs, and
disturbing these patterns can result in unsustainable conditions for species
reliant on water for species reproduction. Longwall mining can also result in
localized water temperature change, stimulating algal bloom which can use up
available oxygen required for other species health.[19]
Longwall mining has limited available research on the impacts of nearby
forests, however emerging satellite imagery studies have shown possible
relations to drier surface soil near regions where longwall mining has recently
occurred. In addition to drier soils, forest canopy moisture has been observed
to be reduced.[20]
**** Gas emissions[edit] ****
Longwall mines have been observed to release methane_gas, a common greenhouse
gas into the environment, however the increase of a typical longwall mine face
from 200 meters to 300 meters was not found to release significantly more
methane.[21][22] Methane emissions from closed longwall mines can continue for
up to fifteen years, however it is possible to measure the volume of potential
methane emissions based on water flow in the closed mines.[21]
***** In Canada[edit] *****
Canada is one of the top coal reserves in the world[23] and up until 2013 there
were no longwall mines in Canada for over 25 years. A mine opened by HD_Mining
in 2015 in British Columbia, causing disputes regarding the hiring of foreign
workers instead of Canadians, and its potential impacts to the environment.[24]
[25] This mine expected to have carbon_dioxide emissions of 17 megatons per
year, however a carbon cap was placed on it by the Canadian_federal_government
to keep the emissions at 500,000 tonnes per year.[25]
