A (named /Ã‹ÂˆeÃ‰Âª/, plural As, A's, as, a's or aes[nb_1]) is the first letter and
the first vowel of the modern_English_alphabet and the ISO_basic_Latin
alphabet.[1] It is similar to the Ancient_Greek_letter alpha, from which it
derives.[2] The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a
triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can
be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey Ã‰Â‘. The latter
is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts
intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic_type.
In the English grammar, "a", and its variant "an", is an indefinite_article.

The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also written 'aleph), the first
letter of the Phoenician_alphabet,[3] which consisted entirely of consonants
(for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true
alphabet). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox
head in proto-Sinaitic_script[4] influenced by Egyptian_hieroglyphs, styled as
a triangular head with two horns extended.
By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the
base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to
the Paleo-Hebrew or Arabic aleph.

When the ancient_Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to
represent the glottal_stopÃ¢Â€Â”the consonant sound that the letter denoted in
Phoenician and other Semitic_languages, and that was the first phoneme of the
Phoenician pronunciation of the letterÃ¢Â€Â”so they used their version of the sign
to represent the vowel /a/, and called it by the similar name of alpha. In the
earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek_Dark_Ages, dating to the 8th
century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek_alphabet of later
times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local
varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at
which the cross line is set.
The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian
Peninsula and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the Etruscan
alphabet to write the Latin_language, and the resulting letter was preserved in
the Latin_alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages,
including English.
**** Typographic variants ****
Different glyphs of the lowercase letter A.
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was
the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or
other "permanent" media. There was also a cursive style used for everyday or
utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the
"perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this
style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving
examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule
cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were
intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants
include the early semi-uncial, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.[5]
Typographic_variants include a double-storey a and single-storey Ã‰Â‘.
At the end of the Roman_Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the
cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the
semicursive minuscule of Italy, the Merovingian_script in France, the
Visigothic_script in Spain, and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or
Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the Caroline
script, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form
used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was
derived through a combining of prior forms.[5]
15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known
today. These variants, the Italic and Roman forms, were derived from the
Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called script a, is used in most
current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly
developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the
hands of medieval Irish and English writers.[3] The Roman form is used in most
printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a").[5]
Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was
common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as
demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg
vertical. In some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed
into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped,
resulting in the modern handwritten form.
Italic_type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish
one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other
cases aside from italic type where script a ("Ã‰Â‘"), also called Latin_alpha, is
used in contrast with Latin "a" (such as in the International_Phonetic
Alphabet).
***** Use in writing systems *****
Pronunciation of the name of the letter &#x27e8;a&#x27e9; in European
languages, note that /a/ and /aÃ‹Â/ can differ phonetically between [a], [ÃƒÂ¤],
[ÃƒÂ¦] and [Ã‰Â‘] depending on the language.
**** English ****
Further information: Pronunciation_of_English_Ã¢ÂŸÂ¨aÃ¢ÂŸÂ©
In modern English_orthography, the letter &#x27e8;a&#x27e9; represents at least
seven different vowel sounds:
    * the near-open_front_unrounded_vowel /ÃƒÂ¦/ as in pad;
    * the open_back_unrounded_vowel /Ã‰Â‘Ã‹Â/ as in father, which is closer to its
      original Latin and Greek sound;[4]
    * the diphthong /eÃ‰Âª/ as in ace and major (usually when &#x27e8;a&#x27e9;
      is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another
      vowel letter) Ã¢Â€Â“ this results from Middle_English_lengthening followed
      by the Great_Vowel_Shift;
    * the modified form of the above sound that occurs before
      &#x27e8;r&#x27e9;, as in square and Mary;
    * the rounded vowel of water;
    * the shorter rounded vowel (not present in General_American) in was and
      what;[3]
    * a schwa, in many unstressed syllables, as in about, comma, solar.
The double &#x27e8;aa&#x27e9; sequence does not occur in native English words,
but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as Aaron and
aardvark.[6] However, &#x27e8;a&#x27e9; occurs in many_common_digraphs, all
with their own sound or sounds, particularly &#x27e8;ai&#x27e9;,
&#x27e8;au&#x27e9;, &#x27e8;aw&#x27e9;, &#x27e8;ay&#x27e9;, &#x27e8;ea&#x27e9;
and &#x27e8;oa&#x27e9;.
&#x27e8;a&#x27e9; is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after
&#x27e8;e&#x27e9; and &#x27e8;t&#x27e9;),[7] and the second most common in
Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in
English texts tend to be &#x27e8;a&#x27e9;, while the number is 6.22% in
Spanish and 3.95% in French.[8]
**** Other languages ****
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, &#x27e8;a&#x27e9; denotes an
open unrounded vowel, such as /a/, /ÃƒÂ¤/, or /Ã‰Â‘/. An exception is Saanich, in
which &#x27e8;a&#x27e9; (and the glyph ÃƒÂ) stands for a close-mid_front
unrounded_vowel /e/.
**** Other systems ****
In phonetic and phonemic notation:
    * in the International_Phonetic_Alphabet, &#x27e8;a&#x27e9; is used for the
      open_front_unrounded_vowel, &#x27e8;ÃƒÂ¤&#x27e9; is used for the open
      central_unrounded_vowel, and &#x27e8;Ã‰Â‘&#x27e9; is used for the open_back
      unrounded_vowel.
    * in X-SAMPA, &#x27e8;a&#x27e9; is used for the open_front_unrounded_vowel
      and &#x27e8;A&#x27e9; is used for the open_back_unrounded_vowel.
***** Other uses *****
Main article: A_(disambiguation)
In algebra, the letter a along with other letters at the beginning of the
alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end
of the alphabet (x, y, z) are used to denote unknown quantities.
In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote segments, lines, rays,
etc.[5] A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent
an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.
[4]
"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more
prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned
by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; A-list
celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a motivating effect, as exposure
to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other
letters.[9]
"A" is used as a prefix on some words, such as asymmetry, to mean "not" or
"without" (from Greek).
In English grammar, "a", and its variant "an", is an indefinite_article.
Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe,[4] or a
small cup size in a brassiere.[citation_needed]
