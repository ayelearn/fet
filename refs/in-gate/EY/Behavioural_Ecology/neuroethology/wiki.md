Echolocation in bats is one model system in neuroethology.
Neuroethology is the evolutionary and comparative approach to the study of
animal behavior and its underlying mechanistic control by the nervous system.
[1][2][3] This interdisciplinary branch of behavioral_neuroscience endeavors to
understand how the central nervous system translates biologically relevant
stimuli into natural behavior. For example, many bats are capable of
echolocation which is used for prey capture and navigation. The auditory system
of bats is often cited as an example for how acoustic properties of sounds can
be converted into a sensory map of behaviorally relevant features of sounds.[4]
Neuroethologists hope to uncover general principles of the nervous system from
the study of animals with exaggerated or specialized behaviors.
As its name implies, neuroethology is a multidisciplinary field composed of
neurobiology (the study of the nervous system) and ethology (the study of
animal behavior in natural conditions). A central theme of the field of
neuroethology, delineating it from other branches of neuroscience, is this
focus on natural behavior, which may be thought of as those behaviors generated
through means of natural_selection (i.e. finding mates, navigation, locomotion,
predator avoidance) rather than behaviors in disease states, or behavioral
tasks that are particular to the laboratory.

***** Philosophy[edit] *****
Neuroethology is an integrative approach to the study of animal behavior that
draws upon several disciplines. Its approach stems from the theory that
animals' nervous systems have evolved to address problems of sensing and acting
in certain environmental niches and that their nervous systems are best
understood in the context of the problems they have evolved to solve. In
accordance with Krogh's_principle, neuroethologists often study animals that
are "specialists" in the behavior the researcher wishes to study e.g. honeybees
and social behavior, bat echolocation, owl sound localization, etc.
The scope of neuroethological inquiry might be summarized by JÃ¶rg-Peter_Ewert,
a pioneer of neuroethology, when he considers the types of questions central to
neuroethology in his 1980 introductory text to the field:
   1. How are stimuli detected by an organism?
   2. How are environmental stimuli in the external world represented in the
      nervous system?
   3. How is information about a stimulus acquired, stored and recalled by the
      nervous system?
   4. How is a behavioral pattern encoded by neural networks?
   5. How is behavior coordinated and controlled by the nervous system?
   6. How can the ontogenetic development of behavior be related to neural
      mechanisms?
Often central to addressing questions in neuroethology are comparative
methodologies, drawing upon knowledge about related organisms' nervous systems,
anatomies, life histories, behaviors and environmental niches. While it is not
unusual for many types of neurobiology experiments to give rise to behavioral
questions, many neuroethologists often begin their research programs by
observing a species' behavior in its natural environment. Other approaches to
understanding nervous systems include the systems identification approach,
popular in engineering. The idea is to stimulate the system using a non-natural
stimulus with certain properties. The system's response to the stimulus may be
used to analyze the operation of the system. Such an approach is useful for
linear systems, but the nervous system is notoriously nonlinear, and
neuroethologists argue that such an approach is limited. This argument is
supported by experiments in the auditory system, which show that neural
responses to complex sounds, like social calls, can not be predicted by the
knowledge gained from studying the responses due to pure tones (one of the non-
natural stimuli favored by auditory neurophysiologists). This is because of the
non-linearity of the system.
Modern neuroethology is largely influenced by the research techniques used.
Neural approaches are necessarily very diverse, as is evident through the
variety of questions asked, measuring techniques used, relationships explored,
and model systems employed. Techniques utilized since 1984 include the use of
intracellular dyes, which make maps of identified neurons possible, and the use
of brain slices, which bring vertebrate brains into better observation through
intracellular electrodes (Hoyle 1984). Currently, other fields toward which
neuroethology may be headed include computational_neuroscience, molecular
genetics, neuroendocrinology and epigenetics. The existing field of neural
modeling may also expand into neuroethological terrain, due to its practical
uses in robotics. In all this, neuroethologists must use the right level of
simplicity to effectively guide research towards accomplishing the goals of
neuroethology.
Critics of neuroethology might consider it a branch of neuroscience concerned
with 'animal trivia'. Though neuroethological subjects tend not to be
traditional neurobiological model systems (i.e. Drosophila, C._elegans, or
Danio_rerio), neuroethological approaches emphasizing comparative methods have
uncovered many concepts central to neuroscience as a whole, such as lateral
inhibition, coincidence_detection, and sensory_maps. The discipline of
neuroethology has also discovered and explained the only vertebrate behavior
for which the entire neural circuit has been described: the electric_fish
jamming_avoidance_response. Beyond its conceptual contributions, neuroethology
makes indirect contributions to advancing human health. By understanding
simpler nervous systems, many clinicians have used concepts uncovered by
neuroethology and other branches of neuroscience to develop treatments for
devastating human diseases.
***** History[edit] *****
The field of neuroethology owes part of its existence to the establishment of
ethology as a unique discipline within the discipline of Zoology. Although
animal behavior had been studied since the time of Aristotle (384â342 BC), it
was not until the early twentieth century that ethology finally became
distinguished from natural science (a strictly descriptive field) and ecology.
The main catalysts behind this new distinction were the research and writings
of Konrad_Lorenz and Niko_Tinbergen.
Konrad Lorenz was born in Austria in 1903, and is widely known for his
contribution of the theory of fixed_action_patterns (FAPs): endogenous,
instinctive behaviors involving a complex sequence of movements that are
triggered ("released") by a certain kind of stimulus. This sequence always
proceeds to completion, even if the original stimulus is removed. It is also
species-specific and performed by nearly all members. Lorenz constructed his
famous "hydraulic model" to help illustrate this concept, as well as the
concept of action specific energy, or drives.
Niko Tinbergen was born in the Netherlands in 1907 and worked closely with
Lorenz in the development of the FAP theory; their studies focused on the egg
retrieval response of nesting geese. Tinbergen performed extensive research on
the releasing mechanisms of particular FAPs, and used the bill-pecking behavior
of baby herring gulls as his model system. This led to the concept of the
supernormal_stimulus. Tinbergen is also well known for his four_questions that
he believed ethologists should be asking about any given animal behavior; among
these is that of the mechanism of the behavior, on a physiological, neural and
molecular level, and this question can be thought of in many regards as the
keystone question in neuroethology. Tinbergen also emphasized the need for
ethologists and neurophysiologists to work together in their studies, a unity
that has become a reality in the field of neuroethology.
Unlike behaviorism, which studied animals' reactions to non-natural stimuli in
artificial, laboratory conditions, ethology sought to categorize and analyze
the natural behaviors of animals in a field_setting. Similarly, neuroethology
asks questions about the neural bases of naturally occurring behaviors, and
seeks to mimic the natural context as much as possible in the laboratory.
Although the development of ethology as a distinct discipline was crucial to
the advent of neuroethology, equally important was the development of a more
comprehensive understanding of neuroscience. Contributors to this new
understanding were the Spanish Neuroanatomist, Ramon_y_Cajal (born in 1852),
and physiologists Charles_Sherrington, Edgar_Adrian, Alan_Hodgkin, and Andrew
Huxley. Charles Sherrington, who was born in Great Britain in 1857, is famous
for his work on the nerve synapse as the site of transmission of nerve
impulses, and for his work on reflexes in the spinal cord. His research also
led him to hypothesize that every muscular activation is coupled to an
inhibition of the opposing muscle. He was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in
1932 along with Lord Edgar Adrian who made the first physiological recordings
of neural activity from single nerve fibers.
Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley (born 1914 and 1917, respectively, in Great
Britain), are known for their collaborative effort to understand the production
of action potentials in the giant axons of squid. The pair also proposed the
existence of ion channels to facilitate action potential initiation, and were
awarded the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their efforts.
As a result of this pioneering research, many scientists then sought to connect
the physiological aspects of the nervous and sensory systems to specific
behaviors. These scientists â Karl_von_Frisch, Erich_von_Holst, and Theodore
Bullock â are frequently referred to as the "fathers" of neuroethology.[5]
Neuroethology did not really come into its own, though, until the 1970s and
1980s, when new, sophisticated experimental methods allowed researchers such as
Masakazu_Konishi, Walter_Heiligenberg, JÃ¶rg-Peter_Ewert, and others to study
the neural circuits underlying verifiable behavior.
***** Modern neuroethology[edit] *****
The International Society for Neuroethology represents the present discipline
of neuroethology, which was founded on the occasion of the NATO-Advanced Study
Institute "Advances in Vertebrate Neuroethology" (August 13â24, 1981)
organized by J.-P. Ewert, D.J. Ingle and R.R. Capranica, held at the University
of Kassel in Hofgeismar, Germany (cf. report Trends in Neurosci. 5:141-
143,1982). Its first president was Theodore_H._Bullock. The society has met
every three years since its first meeting in Tokyo in 1986.
Its membership draws from many research programs around the world; many of its
members are students and faculty members from medical schools and neurobiology
departments from various universities. Modern advances in neurophysiology
techniques have enabled more exacting approaches in an ever-increasing number
of animal systems, as size limitations are being dramatically overcome. Survey
of the most recent (2007) congress of the ISN meeting symposia topics gives
some idea of the field's breadth:
    * Comparative aspects of spatial memory (rodents, birds, humans, bats)
    * Influences of higher processing centers in active sensing (primates,
      owls, electric fish, rodents, frogs)
    * Animal signaling plasticity over many time scales (electric fish, frogs,
      birds)
    * Song production and learning in passerine birds
    * Primate sociality
    * Optimal function of sensory systems (flies, moths, frogs, fish)
    * Neuronal complexity in behavior (insects, computational)
    * Contributions of genes to behavior (Drosophila, honeybees, zebrafish)
    * Eye and head movement (crustaceans, humans, robots)
    * Hormonal actions in brain and behavior (rodents, primates, fish, frogs,
      and birds)
    * Cognition in insects (honeybee)
***** Application to technology[edit] *****
Neuroethology can help create advancements in technology through an advanced
understanding of animal behavior. Model systems were generalized from the study
of simple and related animals to humans. For example, the neuronal cortical
space map discovered in bats, a specialized champion of hearing and navigating,
elucidated the concept of a computational space map. In addition, the discovery
of the space map in the barn owl led to the first neuronal example of the
Jeffress model. This understanding is translatable to understanding spatial
localization in humans, a mammalian relative of the bat. Today, knowledge
learned from neuroethology are being applied in new technologies. For example,
Randall Beer and his colleagues used algorithms learned from insect walking
behavior to create robots designed to walk on uneven surfaces (Beer et al.).
Neuroethology and technology contribute to one another bidirectionally.
Neuroethologists seek to understand the neural basis of a behavior as it would
occur in an animal's natural environment but the techniques for
neurophysiological analysis are lab-based, and cannot be performed in the field
setting. This dichotomy between field and lab studies poses a challenge for
neuroethology. From the neurophysiology perspective, experiments must be
designed for controls and objective rigor, which contrasts with the ethology
perspective â that the experiment be applicable to the animal's natural
condition, which is uncontrolled, or subject to the dynamics of the
environment. An early example of this is when Walter Rudolf Hess developed
focal brain stimulation technique to examine a cat's brain controls of
vegetative functions in addition to other behaviors. Even though this was a
breakthrough in technological abilities and technique, it was not used by many
neuroethologists originally because it compromised a cat's natural state, and,
therefore, in their minds, devalued the experiments' relevance to real
situations.
When intellectual obstacles like this were overcome, it led to a golden age of
neuroethology, by focusing on simple and robust forms of behavior, and by
applying modern neurobiological methods to explore the entire chain of sensory
and neural mechanisms underlying these behaviors (Zupanc 2004). New technology
allows neuroethologists to attach electrodes to even very sensitive parts of an
animal such as its brain while it interacts with its environment.[6] The
founders of neuroethology ushered this understanding and incorporated
technology and creative experimental design. Since then even indirect
technological advancements such as battery-powered and waterproofed instruments
have allowed neuroethologists to mimic natural conditions in the lab while they
study behaviors objectively. In addition, the electronics required for
amplifying neural signals and for transmitting them over a certain distance
have enabled neuroscientists to record from behaving animals[7] performing
activities in naturalistic environments. Emerging technologies can complement
neuroethology, augmenting the feasibility of this valuable perspective of
natural neurophysiology.
Another challenge, and perhaps part of the beauty of neuroethology, is
experimental design. The value of neuroethological criteria speak to the
reliability of these experiments, because these discoveries represent behavior
in the environments in which they evolved. Neuroethologists foresee future
advancements through using new technologies and techniques, such as
computational neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, and molecular genetics that
mimic natural environments.[8]
***** Case studies[edit] *****
**** Jamming avoidance response[edit] ****
In 1963, Akira Watanabe and Kimihisa Takeda discovered the behavior of the
jamming_avoidance_response in the knifefish Eigenmannia sp. In collaboration
with T.H. Bullock and colleagues, the behavior was further developed. Finally,
the work of W._Heiligenberg expanded it into a full neuroethology study by
examining the series of neural connections that led to the behavior.
Eigenmannia is a weakly electric fish that can generate electric discharges
through electrocytes in its tail. Furthermore, it has the ability to
electrolocate by analyzing the perturbations in its electric field. However,
when the frequency of a neighboring fish's current is very close (less than
20 Hz difference) to that of its own, the fish will avoid having their signals
interfere through a behavior known as Jamming Avoidance Response. If the
neighbor's frequency is higher than the fish's discharge frequency, the fish
will lower its frequency, and vice versa. The sign of the frequency difference
is determined by analyzing the "beat" pattern of the incoming interference
which consists of the combination of the two fish's discharge patterns.
Neuroethologists performed several experiments under Eigenmannia's natural
conditions to study how it determined the sign of the frequency difference.
They manipulated the fish's discharge by injecting it with curare which
prevented its natural electric organ from discharging. Then, an electrode was
placed in its mouth and another was placed at the tip of its tail. Likewise,
the neighboring fish's electric field was mimicked using another set of
electrodes. This experiment allowed neuroethologists to manipulate different
discharge frequencies and observe the fish's behavior. From the results, they
were able to conclude that the electric field frequency, rather than an
internal frequency measure, was used as a reference. This experiment is
significant in that not only does it reveal a crucial neural mechanism
underlying the behavior but also demonstrates the value neuroethologists place
on studying animals in their natural habitats.
**** Feature analysis in toad vision[edit] ****
The recognition of prey and predators in the toad was first studied in depth by
JÃ¶rg-Peter_Ewert (Ewert 1974; see also 2004). He began by observing the
natural prey-catching behavior of the common toad (Bufo bufo) and concluded
that the animal followed a sequence that consisted of stalking, binocular
fixation, snapping, swallowing and mouth-wiping. However, initially, the toad's
actions were dependent on specific features of the sensory stimulus: whether it
demonstrated worm or anti-worm configurations. It was observed that the worm
configuration, which signaled prey, was initiated by movement along the
object's long axis, whereas anti-worm configuration, which signaled predator,
was due to movement along the short axis. (Zupanc 2004).
Ewert and coworkers adopted a variety of methods to study the predator versus
prey behavior response. They conducted recording experiments where they
inserted electrodes into the brain, while the toad was presented with worm or
anti-worm stimuli. This technique was repeated at different levels of the
visual system and also allowed feature_detectors to be identified. In focus was
the discovery of prey-selective neurons in the optic tectum, whose axons could
be traced towards the snapping pattern generating cells in the hypoglossal
nucleus. The discharge patterns of prey-selective tectal neurons in response to
prey objects â in freely moving toads â "predicted" prey-catching reactions
such as snapping. Another approach, called stimulation experiment, was carried
out in freely moving toads. Focal electrical stimuli were applied to different
regions of the brain, and the toad's response was observed. When the thalamic-
pretectal region was stimulated, the toad exhibited escape responses, but when
the tectum was stimulated in an area close to prey-selective neurons, the toad
engaged in prey catching behavior (Carew 2000). Furthermore, neuroanatomical
experiments were carried out where the toad's thalamic-pretectal/tectal
connection was lesioned and the resulting deficit noted: the prey-selective
properties were abolished both in the responses of prey-selective neurons and
in the prey catching behavior. These and other experiments suggest that prey
selectivity results from pretecto-tectal influences.
Ewert and coworkers showed in toads that there are stimulus-response mediating
pathways that translate perception (of visual sign stimuli) into action
(adequate behavioral responses). In addition there are modulatory loops that
initiate, modify or specify this mediation (Ewert 2004). Regarding the latter,
for example, the telencephalic caudal ventral striatum is involved in a loop
gating the stimulus-response mediation in a manner of directed attention. The
telencephalic ventral medial pallium (âprimordium hippocampi"), however, is
involved in loops that either modify prey-selection due to associative learning
or specify prey-selection due to non-associative learning, respectively.
***** Computational neuroethology[edit] *****
Computational neuroethology (CN[9] or CNE[10]) is concerned with the computer
modelling of the neural mechanisms underlying animal behaviors. Computational
neuroethology was first argued for in depth by Randall_Beer[11] and by Dave
Cliff[12] both of whom acknowledged the strong influence of Michael_Arbib's
Rana Computatrix computational model of neural mechanisms for visual guidance
in frogs and toads.[13]
CNE systems work within a closed-loop environment; that is, they perceive their
(perhaps artificial) environment directly, rather than through human input, as
is typical in AI systems.[9][14] For example, Barlow et al. developed a time-
dependent model for the retina of the horseshoe crab Limulus_polyphemus on a
Connection_Machine (Model CM-2).[15] Instead of feeding the model retina with
idealized input signals, they exposed the simulation to digitized video
sequences made underwater, and compared its response with those of real
animals.
