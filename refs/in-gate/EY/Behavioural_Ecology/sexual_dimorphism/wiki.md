Sexual dimorphism is the condition where the two sexes of the same species
exhibit different characteristics beyond the differences in their sexual
organs. The condition occurs in many animals and some plants. Differences may
include secondary_sex_characteristics, size, weight, color, markings, and may
also include behavioral and cognitive differences. These differences may be
subtle or exaggerated, and may be subjected to sexual_selection. The opposite
of dimorphism is monomorphism.[1]

***** Overview[edit] *****

**** Ornamentation and coloration[edit] ****
Common and easily identified types of dimorphism consist of ornamentation and
coloration, though not always apparent. A difference in coloration of sexes
within a given species is called sexual dichromatism, which is commonly seen in
many species of birds and reptiles.[2] Sexual selection leads to the
exaggerated dimorphic traits that are used predominantly in competition over
mates. The increased fitness resulting from ornamentation offsets its cost to
produce or maintain suggesting complex evolutionary implications, but the costs
and evolutionary implications vary from species to species.[3]
Exaggerated ornamental traits are used predominantly in the competition over
mates, implying sexual_selection.[4] Ornaments may be costly to produce or
maintain, which has complex evolutionary implications[5] but the costs and
implications differ depending on the nature of the ornamentation (such as the
colour mechanism involved).
The peafowl constitute conspicuous illustrations of the principle. The ornate
plumage of peacocks, as used in the courting display, attracts peahens. At
first sight one might mistake peacocks and peahens for completely different
species because of the vibrant colours and the sheer size of the male's
plumage; the peahen being of a subdued brown coloration.[6] The plumage of the
peacock increases its vulnerability to predators because it is a hindrance in
flight, and it renders the bird conspicuous in general.[6] Similar examples are
manifold, such as in birds_of_paradise and argus_pheasants.
Another example of sexual dichromatism is that of the nestling blue_tits. Males
are chromatically more yellow than females. It is believed that this is
obtained by the ingestion of green lepidopteran larvae, which contain large
amounts of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin.[7] This diet also affects the
sexually dimorphic colours in the human-invisible UV spectrum.[8][9] Hence, the
male birds, although appearing yellow to humans actually have a violet-tinted
plumage that is seen by females. This plumage is thought to be an indicator of
male parental abilities.[10] Perhaps this is a good indicator for females
because it shows that they are good at obtaining a food supply from which the
carotenoid is obtained. There is a positive correlation between the chromas of
the tail and breast feathers and body condition.[11] Carotenoids play an
important role in immune_function for many animals, so carotenoid dependent
signals might indicate health.[12]
Frogs constitute another conspicuous illustration of the principle. There are
two types of dichromatism for frog species: ontogenetic and dynamic.
Ontogenetic frogs are more common and have permanent color changes in males or
females. Litoria_lesueuri is an example of a dynamic frog that has temporary
color changes in males during breeding season.[13] Hyperolius_ocellatus is an
ontogenetic frog with dramatic differences in both color and pattern between
the sexes. At sexual maturity, the males display a bright green with white
dorsolateral lines.[14] In contrast, the females are rusty red to silver with
small spots. The bright coloration in the male population serves to attract
females and as an aposematic sign to potential predators.
Females often show a preference for exaggerated male secondary_sexual
characteristics in mate selection.[15] The sexy son hypothesis explains that
females prefer more elaborate males and select against males that are dull in
color, independent of the speciesâ vision.[16]
Similar sexual dimorphism and mating choice are also observed in many fish
species. For example, male guppies have colorful spots and ornamentations while
females are generally grey in color. Female guppies prefer brightly colored
males to duller males.[17]
**** Physiological differentiation[edit] ****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (April
         2016)
In redlip_blennies, only the male fish develops an organ at the anal-urogenital
region that produces antimicrobial substances. During parental care, males rub
their anal-urogenital regions over their nests' internal surfaces, thereby
protecting their eggs from microbial infections, one of the most common causes
for mortality in young fish.[18]
***** Plants[edit] *****
Most flower plants are hermaphroditic but approximately 6% of species have
separate males and females (dioecy).[19] Males and females in insect-pollinated
species generally look similar to one another because plants provide rewards
(e.g. nectar) that encourage pollinators to visit another similar flower,
completing pollination. Catasetum orchids are one interesting exception to this
rule. Male Catasetum orchids violently attach pollinia to euglossine bee
pollinators. The bees will then avoid other male flowers but may visit the
female, which looks different from the males.[20]
Various other dioecious exceptions, such as Loxostylis_alata have visibly
different genders, with the effect of eliciting the most efficient behaviour
from pollinators, who then use the most efficient strategy in visiting each
gender of flower instead of searching say, for pollen in a nectar-bearing
female flower.
Some plants, such as some species of Geranium have what amounts to serial
sexual dimorphism. The flowers of such species might for example present their
anthers on opening, then shed the exhausted anthers after a day or two and
perhaps change their colours as well while the pistil matures; specialist
pollinators are very much inclined to concentrate on the exact appearance of
the flowers they serve, which saves their time and effort and serves the
interests of the plant accordingly. Some such plants go even further and change
their appearance again once they have been fertilised, thereby discouraging
further visits from pollinators. This is advantageous to both parties because
it avoids damage to the developing fruit and avoids wasting the pollinator's
effort on unrewarding visits. In effect the strategy ensures that the
pollinators can expect a reward every time they visit an appropriately
advertising flower.
Females of the aquatic plant Vallisneria_americana have floating flowers
attached by a long flower_stalk that are fertilized if they contact one of the
thousands of free floating flowers released by a male.[21] Sexual dimorphism is
most often associated with wind-pollination in plants due to selection for
efficient pollen dispersal in males vs pollen capture in females, e.g.
Leucadendron rubrum.[22]
Sexual dimorphism in plants can also be dependent on reproductive development.
This can be seen in Cannabis_sativa, a type of hemp, which have higher
photosynthesis rates in males while growing but higher rates in females once
the plants become sexually mature.[23]
It also should be borne in mind that every sexually reproducing extant species
of vascular plant actually has an alternation of generations; the plants we see
about us generally are diploid sporophytes, but their offspring really are not
the seeds that people commonly recognise as the new generation. The seed
actually is the offspring of the haploid generation of microgametophytes
(pollen) and megagametophytes (the embryo_sacs in the ovules). Each pollen
grain accordingly may be seen as a male plant in its own right; it produces a
sperm cell and is dramatically different from the female plant, the
megagametophyte that produces the female gamete.
***** Insects[edit] *****

Sexual dimorphism: Anthocharis cardamines female
Insects display a wide variety of sexual dimorphism between taxa including
size, ornamentation and coloration.[24] The female-biased sexual size
dimorphism observed in many taxa evolved despite intense male-male competition
for mates.[25] In Osmia_rufa, for example, the female is larger/broader than
males, with males being 8â10 mm in size and females being 10â12 mm in size.
[26] In the hackberry_emperor females are similarly larger than males.[27] The
reason for the sexual dimorphism is due to provision size mass, in which
females consume more pollen than males.[28]
In some species, there is evidence of male dimorphism, but it appears to be for
the purpose of distinctions of roles. This is seen in the bee species Macrotera
portalis in which there is a small-headed morph, capable of flight, and large-
headed morph, incapable of flight, for males.[29] Anthidium_manicatum also
displays male-biased sexual dimorphism. The selection for larger size in males
rather than females in this species may have resulted due to their aggressive
territorial behavior and subsequent differential mating success.[30] Another
example is Lasioglossum_hemichalceum, which is a species of sweat bee that
shows drastic physical dimorphisms between male offpsring.[31] Not all
dimorphism has to have a drastic difference between the sexes. Andrena
agilissima is a mining bee where the females only have a slightly larger head
than the males.[32]
Weaponry leads to increased fitness by increasing success in male-male
competition in many insect species.[33] The beetle horns in Onthophagus_taurus
are enlarged growths of the head or thorax expressed only in the males. Copris
ochus also has distinct sexual and male dimorphism in head horns.[34] These
structures are impressive because of the exaggerated sizes.[35] There is a
direct correlation between male horn lengths and body size and higher access to
mates and fitness.[35] In other beetle species, both males and females may have
ornamentation such as horns.[34] Generally, insect sexual size dimorphism (SSD)
within species increases with body size.[36]
Sexual dimorphism within insects is also displayed by dichromatism. In
butterfly genera Bicyclus and Junonia, dimorphic wing patterns evolved due to
sex-limited expression, which mediates the intralocus sexual conflict and leads
to increased fitness in males.[37] The sexual dichromatic nature of Bicyclus
anyana is reflected by female selection on the basis of dorsal UV-reflective
eyespot pupils (Robertson & Monteiro, 2005).[38] The common_brimstone also
displays sexual dichromatism; males have yellow and iridescent wings, while
female wings are white and non-iridescent.[39] Naturally selected deviation in
protective female coloration is displayed in mimetic butterflies.[40]
***** Spiders and sexual cannibalism[edit] *****

differences in spiders, with dramatically smaller males
Size dimorphism shows a correlation with sexual_cannibalism, which is prominent
in spiders (it is also found in insects such as praying_mantises). In the size
dimorphic wolf_spider, food-limited females cannibalize more frequently.[41]
Therefore, there is a high risk of low fitness for males due to pre-copulatory
cannibalism, which led to male selection of larger females for two reasons:
higher fecundity and lower rates of cannibalism.[41] In addition, female
fecundity is positively correlated with female body size and large female body
size is selected for, which is seen in the family Araneidae. All Argiope
species, including Argiope_bruennichi, use this method. Some males evolved
ornamentation[vague] including binding the female with silk, having
proportionally longer legs, modifying the female's web, mating while the female
is feeding, or providing a nuptial gift in response to sexual cannibalism.[41]
Male body size is not under selection due to cannibalism in all spider species
such as Nephila_pilipes, but is more prominently selected for in less dimorphic
species of spiders, which often selects for larger male size.[42]
***** Fish[edit] *****
Ray finned fish are an ancient and diverse class, with the widest degree of
sexual dimorphism of any animal class. Fairbairn notes that "females are
generally larger than males but males are often larger in species with male-
male combat or male paternal care ... [sizes range] from dwarf males to males
more than 12 times heavier than females"[43]
There are cases where males are substantially larger than females. An example
is Lamprologus_callipterus, a type of cichlid fish. In this fish, the males are
characterized as being up to 60 times larger than the females. The male's
increased size is believed to be advantageous because males collect and defend
empty snail shells in each of which a female breeds.[44] Males must be larger
and more powerful in order to collect the largest shells. The female's body
size must remain small because in order for her to breed, she must lay her eggs
inside the empty shells. If she grows too large, she will not fit in the shells
and will be unable to breed. Another example is the dragonet, in which males
are considerably larger than females and possess longer fins.
The female's small body size is also likely beneficial to her chances of
finding an unoccupied shell. Larger shells, although preferred by females, are
often limited in availability.[45] Hence, the female is limited to the growth
of the size of the shell and may actually change her growth rate according to
shell size availability.[46] In other words, the male's ability to collect
large shells depends on his size. The larger the male, the larger the shells he
is able to collect. This then allows for females to be larger in his brooding
nest which makes the difference between the sizes of the sexes less
substantial. Male-male competition in this fish species also selects for large
size in males. There is aggressive competition by males over territory and
access to larger shells. Large males win fights and steal shells from
competitors. Sexual dimorphism also occurs in hermaphroditic fish. These
species are known as sequential_hermaphrodites. In fish, reproductive_histories
often include the sex-change from female to male where there is a strong
connection between growth, the sex of an individual, and the mating system it
operates within.[47] In protogynous mating systems where males dominate mating
with many females, size plays a significant role in male reproductive success.
[48] Males have a propensity to be larger than females of a comparable age but
it is unclear whether the size increase is due to a growth spurt at the time of
the sexual transition or due to the history of faster growth in sex changing
individuals.[49] Larger males are able to stifle the growth of females and
control environmental resources.
Social organization plays a large role in the changing of sex by the fish. It
is often seen that a fish will change its sex when there is a lack of dominant
male within the social hierarchy. The females that change sex are often those
who attain and preserve an initial size advantage early in life. In either
case, females which change sex to males are larger and often prove to be a good
example of dimorphism.
In other cases with fish, males will go through noticeable changes in body
size, and females will go through morphological changes that can only be seen
inside of the body. For example, in sockeye_salmon, males develop larger body
size at maturity, including an increase in body depth, hump height, and snout
length. Females experience minor changes in snout length, but the most
noticeable difference is the huge increase in gonad size, which accounts for
about 25% of body mass.[50]
Sexual selection was observed for female ornamentation in Gobiusculus
flavescens, known as two-spotted gobies.[51] Traditional hypotheses suggest
that male-male competition drives selection. However, selection for
ornamentation within this species suggests that showy female traits can be
selected through either female-female competition or male mate choice.[51]
Since carotenoid-based ornamentation suggests mate quality, female two-spotted
guppies that develop colorful orange bellies during the breeding season are
considered favorable to males.[52] The males invest heavily in offspring during
the incubation, which leads to the sexual preference in colorful females due to
higher egg quality.[52]
***** Amphibians and non-avian reptiles[edit] *****
In amphibians and reptiles, the degree of sexual dimorphism varies widely among
taxonomic_groups. The sexual dimorphism in amphibians and reptiles may be
reflected in any of the following: anatomy; relative length of tail; relative
size of head; overall size as in many species of vipers and lizards; coloration
as in many amphibians, snakes, and lizards, as well as in some turtles; an
ornament as in many newts and lizards; the presence of specific sex-related
behaviour is common to many lizards; and vocal qualities which are frequently
observed in frogs.
Anole lizards show prominent size dimorphism with males typically being
significantly larger than females. For instance, the average male Anolis_sagrei
was 53.4 mm vs. 40 mm in females.[53] Different sizes of the heads in anoles
have been explained by differences in the estrogen pathway.[54] The sexual
dimorphism in lizards is generally attributed to the effects of sexual
selection, but other mechanisms including ecological divergence and fecundity
selection provide alternative explanations.[55] The development of color
dimorphism in lizards is induced by hormonal changes at the onset of sexual
maturity, as seen in Psamodromus algirus, Sceloporus gadoviae, and S. undulates
erythrocheilus.[55]
Male painted dragon lizards, Ctenophorus_pictus. are brightly conspicuous in
their breeding coloration, but male color declines with aging. Male coloration
appears to reflect innate anti-oxidation capacity that protects against
oxidative_DNA_damage.[56] Male breeding coloration is likely an indicator to
females of the underlying level of oxidative DNA damage (a significant
component of aging) in potential mates.[56]
***** Birds[edit] *****

larger and more colorful than the female
Some bird species, such as this Mute_swan, do not display sexual dimorphism
through their plumage, and instead can be distinguished by other physiological
or behavioural characteristics. Generally, male Mute swans, or cobs, are taller
and larger than females, or pens, and have thicker necks and a more pronounced
'knob' above their bill.
Sexual dimorphism in birds can be manifested in size or plumage differences
between the sexes. Sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa with males
typically being larger, though this is not always the case, e.g. birds_of_prey,
hummingbirds, and some species of flightless birds.[57][58] Plumage dimorphism,
in the form of ornamentation or coloration, also varies, though males are
typically the more ornamented or brightly colored sex.[59] Such differences
have been attributed to the unequal reproductive contributions of the sexes.
[60] This difference produces a stronger female choice since they have more
risk in producing offspring. In some species, the male's contribution to
reproduction ends at copulation, while in other species the male becomes the
main caregiver. Plumage polymorphisms have evolved to reflect these differences
and other measures of reproductive fitness, such as body condition[61] or
survival.[62] The male phenotype sends signals to females who then choose the
'fittest' available male.
Sexual dimorphism is a product of both genetics and environmental factors. An
example of sexual_polymorphism determined by environmental conditions exists in
the red-backed_fairywren. Red-backed fairywren males can be classified into
three categories during breeding_season: black breeders, brown breeders, and
brown auxiliaries.[61] These differences arise in response to the bird's body
condition: if they are healthy they will produce more androgens thus becoming
black breeders, while less healthy birds produce less androgens and become
brown auxiliaries.[61] The reproductive success of the male is thus determined
by his success during each year's non-breeding season, causing reproductive
success to vary with each year's environmental conditions.
Migratory patterns and behaviors also influence sexual dimorphisms. This aspect
also stems back to the size dimorphism in species. It has been shown that the
larger males are better at coping with the difficulties of migration and thusly
are more successful in reproducing when reaching the breeding destination.[63]
When viewing this in an evolutionary standpoint many theories and explanations
come to consideration. If these are the result for every migration and breeding
season the expected results should be a shift towards a larger male population
through sexual selection. Sexual selection is strong when the factor of
environmental selection is also introduced. The environmental selection may
support a smaller chick size if those chicks were born in an area that allowed
them to grow to a larger size, even though under normal conditions they would
not be able to reach this optimal size for migration. When the environment
gives advantages and disadvantages of this sort, the strength of selection is
weakened and the environmental forces are given greater morphological weight.
The sexual dimorphism could also produce a change in timing of migration
leading to differences in mating success within the bird population.[64] When
the dimorphism produces that large of a variation between the sexes and between
the members of the sexes multiple evolutionary effects can take place. This
timing could even lead to a speciation phenomenon if the variation becomes
strongly drastic and favorable towards two different outcomes.

(Ceratogymna_atrata). The difference between the sexes is apparent in the
casque on the top of their bill. This pair is on display at the Museum_of
Osteology.
Sexual_dimorphism is maintained by the counteracting pressures of natural
selection and sexual selection. For example, sexual dimorphism in coloration
increases the vulnerability of bird species to predation by European
sparrowhawks in Denmark.[65] Presumably, increased sexual dimorphism means
males are brighter and more conspicuous, leading to increased predation.[65]
Moreover, the production of more exaggerated ornaments in males may come at the
cost of suppressed immune function.[61] So long as the reproductive benefits of
the trait due to sexual selection are greater than the costs imposed by natural
selection, then the trait will propagate throughout the population.
Reproductive benefits arise in the form of a larger number of offspring, while
natural selection imposes costs in the form of reduced survival. This means
that even if the trait causes males to die earlier, the trait is still
beneficial so long as males with the trait produce more offspring than males
lacking the trait. This balance keeps the dimorphism alive in these species and
ensures that the next generation of successful males will also display these
traits that are attractive to the females.
Such differences in form and reproductive roles often cause differences in
behavior. As previously stated, males and females often have different roles in
reproduction. The courtship and mating behavior of males and females are
regulated largely by hormones throughout a bird's lifetime.[66] Activational
hormones occur during puberty and adulthood and serve to 'activate' certain
behaviors when appropriate, such as territoriality during breeding season.[66]
Organizational hormones occur only during a critical period early in
development, either just before or just after hatching in most birds, and
determine patterns of behavior for the rest of the bird's life.[66] Such
behavioral differences can cause disproportionate sensitivities to
anthropogenic pressures.[67] Females of the whinchat in Switzerland breed in
intensely managed grasslands.[67] Earlier harvesting of the grasses during the
breeding season lead to more female deaths.[67] Populations of many birds are
often male-skewed and when sexual differences in behavior increase this ratio,
populations decline at a more rapid rate.[67] Also not all male dimorphic
traits are due to hormones like testosterone, instead they are a naturally
occurring part of development, for example plumage.[68]
Sexual dimorphism may also influence differences in parental investment during
times of food scarcity. For example, in the blue-footed_booby, the female
chicks grow faster than the males, resulting in booby parents producing the
smaller sex, the males, during times of food shortage. This then results in the
maximization of parental lifetime reproductive success.[69] In Black-tailed
Godwits Limosa limosa limosa females are also the larger sex, and the growth
rates of female chicks are more susceptible to limited environmental
conditions.[70]
Sexual dimorphism may also only appear during mating season, some species of
birds only show dimorphic traits in seasonal variation. The males of these
species will molt into a less bright or less exaggerated color during the off
breeding season.[71] This occurs because the species is more focused on
survival than reproduction, causing a shift into a less ornate state.[dubious
– discuss]
Consequently, sexual dimorphism has important ramifications for conservation.
However, sexual dimorphism is not only found in birds and is thus important to
the conservation of many animals. Such differences in form and behavior can
lead to sexual_segregation, defined as sex differences in space and resource
use.[72] Most sexual segregation research has been done on ungulates,[72] but
such research extends to bats,[73] kangaroos,[74] and birds.[75] Sex-specific
conservation plans have even been suggested for species with pronounced sexual
segregation.[73]
The term sesquimorphism (the Latin numeral_prefix sesqui- means one-and-one-
half, so halfway between mono- (one) and di- (two)) has been proposed for bird
species in which "both sexes have basically the same plumage pattern, though
the female is clearly distinguishable by reason of her paler or washed-out
colour".[76]:14  Examples include Cape_sparrow (Passer melanurus),[76]:67
rufous_sparrow (subspecies P. motinensis motinensis),[76]:80 and saxaul_sparrow
(P. ammodendri).[76]:245
***** Mammals[edit] *****
In a large proportion of mammal species, males are larger than females.[77]
Both genes and hormones affect the formation of many animal brains before
"birth" (or hatching), and also behaviour of adult individuals. Hormones
significantly affect human brain formation, and also brain development at
puberty. A 2004 review in Nature_Reviews_Neuroscience observed that "because it
is easier to manipulate hormone levels than the expression of sex chromosome
genes, the effects of hormones have been studied much more extensively, and are
much better understood, than the direct actions in the brain of sex chromosome
genes." It concluded that while "the differentiating effects of gonadal
secretions seem to be dominant," the existing body of research "support the
idea that sex differences in neural expression of X and Y genes significantly
contribute to sex differences in brain functions and disease."[78]
**** Pinnipeds[edit] ****
Marine_mammals show some of the greatest sexual size differences of mammals,
because of sexual selection.[79] The mating system of pinnipeds varies from
polygyny to serial monogamy. Pinnipeds are known for early differential growth
and maternal investment since the only nutrients for newborn pups is the milk
provided by the mother.[80] For example, the males are significantly larger
than the females at birth in sea lion pups. The pattern of differential
investment can be varied principally prenatally and post-natally.[81] Mirounga
leonina, the southern elephant seal, is one of the most dimorphic mammals.[82]
Sexual dimorphism in elephant seals is associated with the ability of a male to
defend territories, which correlates with polygynic behavior. The large sexual
size dimorphism is due to sexual selection, but also because females reach
reproductive age much earlier than males. In addition the males do not provide
parental care for the young and allocate more energy to growth.[83] This is
supported by the secondary growth spurt in males during adolescent years.[83]

In humans, sex is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or
absence of a Y chromosome, the type of gonads, the sex_hormones, the internal
reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females), and the external
genitalia.[84] Generally, the five factors are either all male or all female.
Sexual ambiguity is rare in humans, but wherein such ambiguity does occur, the
individual is biologically classified as intersex.
Sexual dimorphism among humans includes differentiation among gonads, internal
genitals, external genitals, breasts, muscle mass, height, the endocrine
(hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioral effects. Human sexual
differentiation is effected primarily at the gene level, by the presence or
absence of a Y-chromosome, which encodes biochemical modifiers for sexual
development in males.[85] According to Clark Spencer Larsen, modern day Homo
sapiens show a range of sexual dimorphism, with average body mass difference
between the sexes being roughly equal to 15%.[86]
The average basal_metabolic_rate is about 6 percent higher in adolescent males
than females and increases to about 10 percent higher after puberty. Females
tend to convert more food into fat, while males convert more into muscle and
expendable circulating energy reserves. Aggregated data of absolute strength
indicates that females have, on average, 40â60% the upper body strength of
males, and 70â75% the lower body strength.[87] The difference in strength
relative to body mass is less pronounced in trained individuals. In Olympic
weightlifting, male records vary from 5.5Ã body mass in the lowest weight
category to 4.2Ã in the highest weight category, while female records vary
from 4.4Ã to 3.8Ã, a weight adjusted difference of only 10â20%, and an
absolute difference of about 30% (i.e. 472 kg vs 333 kg for unlimited weight
classes)(see Olympic_weightlifting_records). A study, carried about by
analyzing annual world rankings from 1980â1996, found that males' running
times were, on average, 11% faster than females'.[88]
Females are taller, on average, than males in early adolescence, but males, on
average, surpass them in height in later adolescence and adulthood. In the
United States, adult males are, on average, 9% taller[89] and 16.5% heavier[90]
than adult females. There is no comparative evidence of differing levels of
sexual selection having produced sexual size dimorphism between human
populations.[91]
Males typically have larger tracheae and branching bronchi, with about 30
percent greater lung_volume per body_mass. On average, males have larger
hearts, 10 percent higher red_blood_cell count, higher hemoglobin, hence
greater oxygen-carrying capacity. They also have higher circulating clotting
factors (vitamin_K, prothrombin and platelets). These differences lead to
faster healing of wounds and higher peripheral pain tolerance.[92]
Females typically have more white_blood_cells (stored and circulating), more
granulocytes and B and T lymphocytes. Additionally, they produce more
antibodies at a faster rate than males. Hence they develop fewer infectious
diseases and succumb for shorter periods.[92] Ethologists argue that females,
interacting with other females and multiple offspring in social groups, have
experienced such traits as a selective advantage.[93][94][95][96][97]
Considerable discussion in academic literature concerns potential evolutionary
advantages associated with sexual competition (both intrasexual and
intersexual) and short- and long-term sexual strategies.[98] According to Daly
and Wilson, "The sexes differ more in human beings than in monogamous mammals,
but much less than in extremely polygamous mammals."[99] One proposed
explanation is that human sexuality has developed more in common with its close
relative the bonobo, who have similar sexual dimorphism and which are
polygynandrous and use recreational_sex to reinforce social bonds and reduce
aggression.[100]
In the human_brain, a difference between sexes was observed in the
transcription of the PCDH11X/Y gene pair unique to Homo sapiens.[101] Sexual
differentiation in the human brain from the undifferentiated state is triggered
by testosterone from the fetal testis. Testosterone is converted to estrogen in
the brain through the action of the enzyme aromatase. Testosterone acts on many
brain areas, including the SDN-POA, to create the masculinized brain pattern.
[102] Brains of pregnant females carrying male fetuses may be shielded from the
masculinizing effects of androgen through the action of sex-hormone binding
globulin.[103]
The relationship between sex differences in the brain and human behavior is a
subject of controversy in psychology and society at large.[104][105] Many
females tend to have a higher ratio of gray_matter in the left hemisphere of
the brain in comparison to males.[106][107] Males on average have larger brains
than females; however, when adjusted for total brain volume the gray matter
differences between sexes is almost nonexistent. Thus, the percentage of gray
matter appears to be more related to brain size than it is to sex.[108][109]
Differences in brain physiology between sexes do not necessarily relate to
differences in intellect. Haier et al. found in a 2004 study that "men and
women apparently achieve similar IQ results with different brain regions,
suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to
general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest
equivalent intellectual performance".[110] (See the sex_and_intelligence
article for more on this subject.) Strict graph-theoretical analysis of the
human brain connections revealed[111] that in numerous graph-theoretical
parameters (e.g., minimum bipartition width, edge number, the expander_graph
property, minimum vertex_cover), the structural connectome of women are
significantly "better" connected than the connectome of men. It was shown[112]
that the graph-theoretical differences are due to the sex and not to the
differences in the cerebral volume, by analyzing the data of 36 females and 36
males, where the brain volume of each man in the group was smaller than the
brain volume of each woman in the group.
Sexual dimorphism was also described in the gene level and shown to be extend
from the sex chromosomes. Overall, about 6500 genes have been found to have
sex-differential expression in at least one tissue. Many of these genes are not
directly associated with reproduction, but rather linked to more general
biological features. In addition, it has been shown that genes with sex
specific expression undergo reduced selection efficiency, which lead to higher
population frequencies of deleterious mutations and contributing to the
prevalence of several human diseases.[113][114]
***** Cells[edit] *****
Phenotypic differences between sexes are evident even in cultured_cells from
tissues.[115] For example, female muscle-derived stem_cells have a better
muscle regeneration efficiency than male ones.[116] There are reports of
several metabolic differences between male and female cells[117] and they also
respond to stress differently.[118]
***** Reproductively advantageous[edit] *****
In theory, larger females are favored by competition for mates, especially in
polygamous species. Larger females offer an advantage in fertility, since the
physiological demands of reproduction are limiting in females. Hence there is a
theoretical expectation that females tend to be larger in species that are
monogamous. Females are larger in many species of insects, many spiders, many
fish, many reptiles, owls, birds of prey and certain mammals such as the
spotted_hyena, and baleen whales such as blue_whale. As an example, in some
species, females are sedentary, and so males must search for them. Fritz
Vollrath and Geoff_Parker argue that this difference in behaviour leads to
radically different selection pressures on the two sexes, evidently favouring
smaller males.[119] Cases where the male is larger than the female have been
studied as well,[119] and require alternative explanations.
One example of this type of sexual size dimorphism is the bat Myotis_nigricans,
(black myotis bat) where females are substantially larger than males in terms
of body weight, skull measurement, and forearm length.[120] The interaction
between the sexes and the energy needed to produce viable offspring make it
favorable for females to be larger in this species. Females bear the energetic
cost of producing eggs, which is much greater than the cost of making sperm by
the males. The fecundity advantage hypothesis states that a larger female is
able to produce more offspring and give them more favorable conditions to
ensure their survival; this is true for most ectotherms. A larger female can
provide parental care for a longer time while the offspring matures. The
gestation and lactation periods are fairly long in M. nigricans, the females
suckling their offspring until they reach nearly adult size.[121] They would
not be able to fly and catch prey if they did not compensate for the additional
mass of the offspring during this time. Smaller male size may be an adaptation
to increase maneuverability and agility, allowing males to compete better with
females for food and other resources.
Female triplewart_seadevil, an anglerfish, with male attached near vent (arrow)
Some species of anglerfish also display extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are
more typical in appearance to other fish, whereas the males are tiny
rudimentary creatures with stunted digestive systems. A male must find a female
and fuse with her: he then lives parasitically, becoming little more than a
sperm-producing body in what amounts to an effectively hermaphrodite composite
organism. A similar situation is found in the Zeus water bug Phoreticovelia
disparata where the female has a glandular area on her back that can serve to
feed a male, which clings to her (note that although males can survive away
from females, they generally are not free-living).[122] This is taken to the
logical extreme in the Rhizocephala crustaceans, like the Sacculina, where the
male injects itself into the female's body and becomes nothing more than sperm
producing cells, to the point that the superorder used to be mistaken for
hermaphroditic.[123]
Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are
significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss Dicranum[124] and the
liverwort Sphaerocarpos.[125] There is some evidence that, in these genera, the
dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome,[125][126] or to chemical signalling
from females.[127]
Another complicated example of sexual dimorphism is in Vespula_squamosa, the
southern yellowjacket. In this wasp species, the female workers are the
smallest, the male workers are slightly larger, and the female queens are
significantly larger than her female worker and male counterparts.[citation

***** Evolution[edit] *****
See also: Sexual_selection and Mate_choice
Sexual dimorphism in Cambrian trilobites.[128]
Sexual dimorphism by size is evident in some extinct species such as the
velociraptor. In the case of velociraptors the sexual size dimorphism may have
been caused by two factors: male competition for hunting ground to attract
mates, and/or female competition for nesting locations and mates, males being a
scarce breeding resource.[129]
In 1871, Charles_Darwin advanced the theory_of_sexual_selection, which related
sexual dimorphism with sexual_selection.
It has been proposed that the earliest sexual dimorphism is the size
differentiation of sperm and eggs (anisogamy), but the evolutionary
significance of sexual dimorphism is more complex than that would suggest.[130]
Anisogamy and the usually large number of small male gametes relative to the
larger female gametes usually lies in the development of strong sperm
competition,[131][132] because small sperm enable organisms to produce a large
number of sperm, and make males (or male function of hermaphrodites[133]) more
redundant. This intensifies male competition for mates and promotes the
evolution of other sexual dimorphism in many species, especially in vertebrates
including mammals. However, in some species, the females can be larger than
males, irrespective of gametes, and in some species females (usually of species
in which males invest a lot in rearing offspring and thus no longer considered
as so redundant) compete for mates in ways more usually associated with males.
In many non-monogamous species, the benefit to a male's reproductive fitness of
mating with multiple females is large, whereas the benefit to a female's
reproductive fitness of mating with multiple males is small or nonexistent.
[134] In these species, there is a selection_pressure for whatever traits
enable a male to have more matings. The male may therefore come to have
different traits from the female.
Male (left), offspring, and female (right) Sumatran orangutans.
These traits could be ones that allow him to fight off other males for control
of territory or a harem, such as large size or weapons;[135] or they could be
traits that females, for whatever reason, prefer in mates.[136] Male-male
competition poses no deep theoretical questions[137] but mate_choice does.
Females may choose males that appear strong and healthy, thus likely to possess
"good alleles" and give rise to healthy offspring.[138] In some species,
however, females seem to choose males with traits that do not improve offspring
survival rates, and even traits that reduce it (potentially leading to traits
like the peacock's tail).[137] Two hypotheses for explaining this fact are the
sexy_son_hypothesis and the handicap_principle.
The sexy son hypothesis states that females may initially choose a trait
because it improves the survival of their young, but once this preference has
become widespread, females must continue to choose the trait, even if it
becomes harmful. Those that do not will have sons that are unattractive to most
females (since the preference is widespread) and so receive few matings.[139]
The handicap principle states that a male who survives despite possessing some
sort of handicap thus proves that the rest of his genes are "good alleles". If
males with "bad alleles" could not survive the handicap, females may evolve to
choose males with this sort of handicap; the trait is acting as a hard-to-fake
signal of fitness.[140]
