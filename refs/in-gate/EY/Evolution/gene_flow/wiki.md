The transfer of genetic variation from one population to another
Gene flow is the transfer of alleles from one population to another population
through immigration of individuals.
In population_genetics, gene flow (also known as gene migration or allele flow)
is the transfer of genetic_variation from one population to another. If the
rate of gene flow is high enough, then two populations are considered to have
equivalent allele frequencies and therefore effectively be a single population.
It has been shown that it takes only "One migrant per generation" to prevent
populations from diverging due to drift.[1] Gene flow is an important mechanism
for transferring genetic diversity among populations. Migrants change the
distribution of genetic diversity within the populations, by modifying the
allele_frequencies (the proportion of members carrying a particular variant of
a gene). High rates of gene flow can reduce the genetic differentiation between
the two groups, increasing homogeneity. For this reason, gene flow has been
thought to constrain speciation by combining the gene pools of the groups, thus
preventing the development of differences in genetic variation that would have
led to full speciation.[2] In some cases migration may also result in the
addition of novel genetic variants to the gene_pool of a species or population.
There are a number of factors that affect the rate of gene flow between
different populations. Gene flow is expected to be lower in species that have
low dispersal or mobility, that occur in fragmented habitats, where there is
long distances between populations, and when there are small population sizes.
[3][4] Mobility plays an important role in the migration rate, as highly mobile
individuals tend to have greater migratory prospects. Although animals are
thought to be more mobile than plants, pollen and seeds may be carried great
distances by animals or wind. When gene flow is impeded, there can be an
increase in inbreeding, measured by the inbreeding_coefficient (F) within a
population. For example, many island populations have low rates of gene flow
due to geographic isolation and small population sizes. The Black_Footed_Rock
Wallaby has several inbred populations that live on various islands off the
coast of Australia. The population is so strongly isolated that lack of gene
flow has led to high rates of inbreeding.[5]

***** Measuring gene flow[edit] *****
Decrease in population size leads to increased divergence due to drift, while
migration reduces divergence and inbreeding. Gene flow can be measured by using
the effective population_size (     N  e     {\displaystyle N_{e}}  [N_e]) and
the net migration rate per generation (m). Using the approximation based on the
Island model, the effect of migration can be calculated for a population in
terms of the degree of genetic differentiation(    F s t   {\displaystyle Fst}
[{\displaystyle Fst}]).[6] This formula accounts for the proportion of total
molecular_marker variation among populations, averaged over loci.[7] When there
is one migrant per generation, the inbreeding coefficient (    F s t
{\displaystyle Fst}  [{\displaystyle Fst}]) equals 0.2. However, when there is
less than 1 migrant per generation (no migration), the inbreeding coefficient
rises rapidly resulting in fixation and complete divergence (    F s t
{\displaystyle Fst}  [{\displaystyle Fst}] = 1). The most common     F s t
{\displaystyle Fst}  [{\displaystyle Fst}] is < 0.25. This means there is some
migration happening. Measures of population structure range from 0 to 1. When
gene flow occurs via migration the deleterious effects of inbreeding can be
ameliorated[1].
   F s t = 1  /  ( 4  N  e   m + 1 )   {\displaystyle Fst=1/(4N_{e}m+1)}  [
{\displaystyle Fst=1/(4N_{e}m+1)}]
The formula can be modified to solve for the migration rate when     F s t
{\displaystyle Fst}  [{\displaystyle Fst}] is known:     N m = ( 1  /  F s t
&#x2212; 1 )  /  4   {\displaystyle Nm=(1/Fst-1)/4}  [{\displaystyle Nm=(1/Fst-
1)/4}], Nm = number of migrants [1].
***** Barriers to gene flow[edit] *****
**** Allopatric speciation[edit] ****
Examples of speciation affecting gene flow.
When gene flow is blocked by physical barriers, this results in Allopatric
speciation or a geographical isolation that does not allow populations of the
same species to exchange genetic material. Physical barriers to gene flow are
usually, but not always, natural. They may include impassable mountain ranges,
oceans, or vast deserts. In some cases, they can be artificial, man-made
barriers, such as the Great_Wall_of_China, which has hindered the gene flow of
native plant populations.[8] One of these native plants, Ulmus_pumila,
demonstrated a lower prevalence of genetic differentiation than the plants
Vitex negundo, Ziziphus jujuba, Heteropappus hispidus, and Prunus armeniaca
whose habitat is located on the opposite side of the Great_Wall_of_China where
Ulmus pumila grows.[8] This is because Ulmus pumila has wind-pollination as its
primary means of propagation and the latter-plants carry out pollination
through insects.[8] Samples of the same species which grow on either side have
been shown to have developed genetic differences, because there is little to no
gene flow to provide recombination of the gene pools.
**** Sympatric speciation[edit] ****
Barriers to gene flow need not always be physical. Sympatric speciation happens
when new species from the same ancestral species arise along the same range.
This is often a result of a reproductive barrier. For example, two palm species
of Howea found on Lord Howe Island were found to have substantially different
flowering times correlated with soil preference, resulting in a reproductive
barrier inhibiting gene flow.[9] Species can live in the same environment, yet
show very limited gene flow due to reproductive barriers, fragmentation,
specialist pollinators, or limited hybridization or hybridization yielding
unfit hybrids. A cryptic species is a species that humans cannot tell is
different without the use of genetics. Moreover, gene flow between hybrid and
wild populations can result in loss of genetic diversity via genetic_pollution,
assortative_mating and outbreeding. In human populations, genetic
differentiation can also result from endogamy, due to differences in caste,
ethnicity, customs and religion.
***** Human assisted gene-flow[edit] *****
**** Genetic rescue[edit] ****
Gene flow can also be used to assist species which are threatened with
extinction. When a species exist in small populations there is an increased
risk of inbreeding and greater susceptibility to loss of diversity due to
drift. These populations can benefit greatly from the introduction of unrelated
individuals who can increase diversity and reduce the amount of inbreeding, and
thus increase overall fitness. This was demonstrated in the lab with two
bottleneck strains of drosophila melanogaster, in which crosses between the two
populations reversed the effects of inbreeding and led to greater chances of
survival in not only one generation but two.[10]
**** Genetic pollution[edit] ****
Main article: Genetic_pollution
Human activities such as movement of species and modification of landscape can
result in genetic pollution, hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping.
These processes can lead to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as
a result of either a numerical and/or fitness advantage of introduced plant or
animal.[11] Nonnative species can threaten native plants and animals with
extinction by hybridization and introgression either through purposeful
introduction by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously
isolated species into contact. These phenomena can be especially detrimental
for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones which can occur
between island and mainland species. Interbreeding between the species can
cause a 'swamping' of the rarer species' gene pool, creating hybrids that
supplant the native stock. This is a direct result of evolutionary forces such
as natural selection, as well as genetic drift, which lead to the increasing
prevalence of advantageous traits and homogenization. The extent of this
phenomenon is not always apparent from outward_appearance alone. While some
degree of gene flow occurs in the course of normal evolution, hybridization
with or without introgression may threaten a rare species' existence.[12][13]
For example, the Mallard is an abundant species of duck that interbreeds
readily with a wide range of other ducks and poses a threat to the integrity of
some species.[14]
***** Gene flow between species[edit] *****
**** Horizontal gene transfer[edit] ****
Main article: Horizontal_gene_transfer
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) refers to the transfer of genes between
organisms in a manner other than traditional reproduction, either through
transformation (direct uptake of genetic material by a cell from its
surroundings), conjugation (transfer of genetic_material between two bacterial
cells in direct contact), transduction (injection of foreign DNA by a
bacteriophage virus into the host cell) or GTA-mediated_transduction (transfer
by a virus-like element produced by a bacterium) .[15][16]
Viruses can transfer genes between species.[17] Bacteria can incorporate genes
from dead bacteria, exchange genes with living bacteria, and can exchange
plasmids across species boundaries.[18] "Sequence comparisons suggest recent
horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the
boundaries of phylogenetic 'domains'. Thus determining the phylogenetic history
of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for
single genes."[19]
Biologist Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the
data from recent genome research". Biologists [should] instead use the metaphor
of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes
and use the metaphor of an intertwined net to visualize the rich exchange and
cooperative effects of horizontal gene transfer.[20]
"Using single genes as phylogenetic_markers, it is difficult to trace
organismal phylogeny in the presence of HGT. Combining the simple coalescence
model of cladogenesis with rare HGT events suggest there was no single last
common_ancestor that contained all of the genes ancestral to those shared among
the three domains of life. Each contemporary molecule has its own history and
traces back to an individual molecule cenancestor. However, these molecular
ancestors were likely to be present in different organisms at different times."
[21]
**** Hybridization[edit] ****
In some instances, when a species has a sister species and breeding
capabilities are possible due to the removal of previous barriers or through
introduction due to human intervention, species can hybridize and exchange
genes and corresponding traits. This exchange is not always clear-cut, for
sometimes the hybrids may look identical to the original species phenotypically
but upon testing the mtDNA it is apparent that hybridization has occurred.
Differential hybridization also occurs because some traits and DNA are more
readily exchanged than others, and this is a result of selective pressure or
the absence thereof that allows for easier transaction. In instances in which
the introduced species begins to replace the native species, the native species
becomes threatened and the biodiversity is reduced, thus making this phenomenon
negative rather than a positive case of gene flow that augments genetic
diversity. Introgression is the replacement of the native species genes with
that of the invader species. It is important to note that hybrids are generally
deemed less "fit" than their parental generation, and as a result is a closely
monitored genetic issue as the ultimate goal in conservation genetics is to
maintain the genetic integrity of a species and preserve biodiversity.
***** Examples[edit] *****
Marine_iguana of the Galapagos_Islands evolved via allopatric speciation,
through limited gene flow and geographic isolation.
While gene flow can greatly enhance the fitness of a population, it can also
have negative consequences depending on the population and the environment in
which they reside. The effects of gene flow are context-dependent.
    * Fragmented Population: fragmented landscapes such as the Galapagos
      Islands are an ideal place for adaptive_radiation to occur as a result of
      differing geography. Darwin's_finches likely experienced allopatric
      speciation in some part due to differing geography, but that doesn't
      explain why we see so many different kinds of finches on the same island.
      This is due to adaptive radiation, or the evolution of varying traits in
      light of competition for resources. Gene flow moves in the direction of
      what resources are abundant at a given time.[22]
    * Island Population: The marine_iguana is an endemic species of the
      Galapagos Islands, but it evolved from a mainland ancestor of land
      iguana. Due to geographic isolation gene flow between the two species was
      limited and differing environments caused the marine iguana to evolve in
      order to adapt to the island environment. For instance, they are the only
      iguana that has evolved the ability to swim.
    * Human Populations: Two theories exist for the human_evolution throughout
      the world. The first is known as the multiregional model in which modern
      human variation is seen as a product of radiation of homo_erectus out of
      Africa after which local differentiation led to the establishment of
      regional population as we see them now.[23][24] Gene flow plays an
      important role in maintaining a grade of similarities and preventing
      speciation. In contrast the single origin theory assumes that there was a
      common ancestral population originating in Africa of homo_sapiens which
      already displayed the anatomical characteristics we see today. This
      theory minimizes the amount of parallel evolution that is needed.[24]
    * Butterflies: Comparisons between sympatric and allopatric populations
      of heliconius_melpomene, H. cydno, and H. timareta revealed a genome-wide
      trend of increased shared variation in sympatry, indicative of pervasive
      interspecific gene flow.[25] 
    * Human-mediated gene flow: The captive genetic management of threatened
      species is the only way in which humans attempt to induce gene flow in ex
      situ situation. One example is the giant_panda which is part of an
      international breeding program in which genetic materials are shared
      between zoological organizations in order to increase genetic diversity
      in the small populations. As a result of low reproductive success,
      artificial insemination with fresh/frozen-thawed sperm was developed
      which increased cub survival rate. A 2014 study found that high levels of
      genetic diversity and low levels of inbreeding were estimated in the
      breeding centers.[26]
    * Plants: Two populations of monkeyflowers were found to use different
      pollinators (bees and hummingbirds) that limited gene flow, resulting in
      genetic isolation, eventually producing two different species, mimulus
      lewisii and mimulus_cardinalis .[27]
    * Sika deer: Sika deer were introduced into Western Europe, and they
      reproduce easily with the native red deer. This translocation of Sika
      deer has led to introgression and there are no longer "pure" red deer in
      the region, and all can be classified as hybrids.[28]
    * Bobwhite quail: Bobwhite quail were translocated from the southern part
      of the United States to Ontario in order to increase population numbers
      and game for hunting.The hybrids that resulted from this translocation
      was less fit than the native population and were not adapted to survived
      the Northern Winters. [29]
