David_Sloan_Wilson and Elliott_Sober's 1994 Multilevel Selection Model,
illustrated by a nested set of Russian matryoshka_dolls. Wilson himself
compared his model to such a set.
A unit of selection is a biological entity within the hierarchy of biological
organization (for example, an entity such as: a self-replicating_molecule, a
gene, a cell, an organism, a group, or a species) that is subject to natural
selection. There is debate among evolutionary biologists about the extent to
which evolution has been shaped by selective pressures acting at these
different levels.[1][2][3]
There is debate over the relative importance of the units themselves. For
instance, is it group or individual selection that has driven the evolution of
altruism? Where altruism reduces the fitness of individuals, individual-
centered explanations for the evolution of altruism become complex and rely on
the use of game_theory,[4][5] for instance; see kin_selection and group
selection. There also is debate over the definition of the units themselves,
and the roles for selection and replication,[2] and whether these roles may
change in the course of evolution.[6]

***** Fundamental theory[edit] *****
Two useful introductions to the fundamental theory underlying the unit of
selection issue and debate, which also present examples of multi-level
selection from the entire range of the biological hierarchy (typically with
entities at level N-1 competing for increased representation, i.e., higher
frequency, at the immediately higher level N, e.g., organisms in populations or
cell lineages in organisms), are Richard_Lewontin's classic piece The_Units_of
Selection[7] and John_Maynard-Smith and EÃ¶rs_SzathmÃ¡ry's co-authored book,
The_Major_Transitions_in_Evolution. As a theoretical introduction to what is at
stake vis-a-vis units of selection, Lewontin writes:
     The generality of the principles of natural selection means that any
     entities in nature that have variation, reproduction, and
     heritability may evolve. ...the principles can be applied equally to
     genes, organisms, populations, species, and at opposite ends of the
     scale, prebiotic molecules and ecosystems." (1970, pp. 1-2)
Elisabeth_Lloyd's book The Structure and Confirmation of Evolutionary Theory
provides a basic philosophical introduction to the debate.
***** Selection at each level[edit] *****
Below, cases of selection at the genic, cellular, individual and group level
from within the multi-level selection perspective are presented and discussed.
**** Nucleic acid[edit] ****
Main article: Gene-centered_view_of_evolution
George_C._Williams in his influential book Adaptation_and_Natural_Selection was
one of the first to present a gene-centered_view_of_evolution with the gene as
the unit of selection, arguing that a unit of selection should exhibit a high
degree of permanence.
Richard_Dawkins has written several books popularizing and expanding the idea.
According to Dawkins, genes cause phenotypes and a gene is 'judged' by its
phenotypic effects. Dawkins distinguishes entities which survive or fail to
survive ("replicators") from entities with temporary existence that interact
directly with the environment ("vehicles"). Genes are "replicators" whereas
individuals and groups of individuals are "vehicles". Dawkins argues that,
although they are both aspects of the same process, "replicators" rather than
"vehicles" should be preferred as units of selection. This is because
replicators, owing to their permanence, should be regarded as the ultimate
beneficiaries of adaptations. Genes are replicators and therefore the gene is
the unit of selection. Dawkins further expounded this view in an entire chapter
called 'God's_utility_function' in the book River_Out_of_Eden where he
explained that genes alone have utility_functions.[8]
Some clear-cut examples of selection at the level of the gene include meiotic
drive and retrotransposons. In both of these cases, gene sequences increase
their relative frequency in a population without necessarily providing benefits
at other levels of organization. Meiotic-drive mutations (see segregation
distortion) manipulate the machinery of chromosomal segregation so that
chromosomes carrying the mutation are later found in more than half of the
gametes produced by individuals heterozygous for the mutation, and for this
reason the frequency of the mutation increases in the population.
Retrotransposons are DNA sequences that, once replicated by the cellular
machinery, insert themselves in the genome more or less randomly. Such
insertions can be very mutagenic and thus reduce drastically individual
fitness, so that there is strong selection against elements that are very
active. Meiotic-drive alleles have also been shown strongly to reduce
individual fitness, clearly exemplifying the potential conflict between
selection at different levels.
According to the RNA_world hypothesis, RNA sequences performing both enzymatic
and information storage roles in autocatalytic sets were an early unit of
selection and evolution that would later transition into living cells.[9] It is
possible that RNA-based_evolution is still taking place today. Other
subcellular entities such as viruses, both DNA-based and RNA-based, do_evolve.
**** Epigene[edit] ****
Main articles: Transgenerational_epigenetic_inheritance and Contribution_of
epigenetic_modifications_to_evolution
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (March
         2018)
There is also view that evolution is acting on epigenes.[10]
**** Cell[edit] ****
Leo_Buss in his book The_Evolution_of_Individuality proposes that much of the
evolution_of_development in animals reflects the conflict between selective
pressures acting at the level of the cell and those acting at the level of the
multicellular individual. This perspective can shed new light on phenomena as
diverse as gastrulation and germ line sequestration.
This selection for unconstrained proliferation is in conflict with the fitness
interests of the individual, and thus there is tension between selection at the
level of the cell and selection at the level of the individual. Since the
proliferation of specific cells of the vertebrate immune system to fight off
infecting pathogens is a case of programmed and exquisitely contained cellular
proliferation, it represents a case of the individual manipulating selection at
the level of the cell to enhance its own fitness. In the case of the vertebrate
immune system, selection at the level of the cell and individual are not in
conflict.
Some view cancer_stem_cells as units of selection.[11]
**** Behavioural[edit] ****
Further information: Memetics, Geneâculture_coevolution, Sociocultural
evolution, and Cultural_evolutionism
Geneâculture coevolution was developed to explain how human behavior is a
product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic
evolution and cultural evolution.
**** Organism[edit] ****
Further information: Hologenome_theory_of_evolution
Selection at the level of the organism can be described as Darwinism, and is
well understood and considered common. If a relatively faster gazelle manages
to survive and reproduce more, the causation of the higher fitness of this
gazelle can be fully accounted for if one looks at how individual gazelles fare
under predation.
The speed of the faster gazelle could be caused by a single gene, be polygenic,
or be fully environmentally determined, but the unit of selection in this case
is the individual since speed is a property of each individual gazelle.
When speaking about individual organism evolution an extended_phenotype and
superorganism must be also mentioned.
**** Group[edit] ****
Main article: Group_selection
If a group of organisms, owing to their interactions or division of labor,
provides superior fitness compared to other groups, where the fitness of the
group is higher or lower than the mean fitness of the constituent individuals,
group selection can be declared to occur.[12]
Specific syndromes of selective factors can create situations in which groups
are selected because they display group properties which are selected-for. Many
common examples of group traits are reducible to individual traits, however.
Selection of these traits is thus more simply explained as selection of
individual traits.
Some mosquito-transmitted rabbit viruses are only transmitted to uninfected
rabbits from infected rabbits which are still alive. This creates a selective
pressure on every group of viruses already infecting a rabbit not to become too
virulent and kill their host rabbit before enough mosquitoes have bitten it,
since otherwise all the viruses inside the dead rabbit would rot with it. And
indeed in natural systems such viruses display much lower virulence levels than
do mutants of the same viruses that in laboratory culture readily outcompete
non-virulent variants (or than do tick-transmitted viruses since ticks do bite
dead rabbits).
In the previous passage, the group is assumed to have "lower virulence", i.e.,
"virulence" is presented as a group trait. One could argue then that the
selection is in fact against individual viruses that are too virulent. In this
case, however, the fitness of all viruses within a rabbit is affected by what
the group does to the rabbit. Indeed, the proper, directly selected group
property is that of "not killing the rabbit too early" rather than individual
virulence. In situations such as these, we would expect there to be selection
for cooperation amongst the viruses in a group in such a way that the group
will not "kill the rabbit too early". It is of course true that any group
behavior is the result of individual traits, such as individual viruses
suppressing the virulence of their neighbours, but the causes of phenotypes are
rarely the causes of fitness differences.
**** Species and higher levels[edit] ****
It remains controversial among biologists whether selection can operate at and
above the level of species.[13] Proponents of species selection include R._A.
Fisher (1929);[13] Sewall_Wright (1956);[13] Richard_Lewontin (1970);[13] Niles
Eldredge & Stephen_Jay_Gould (1972); Steven_M._Stanley (1975).[14][13] Gould
proposed that there exist macroevolutionary processes which shape evolution,
not driven by the microevolutionary mechanisms of the Modern_Synthesis.[15] If
one views species as entities that replicate (speciate) and die (go extinct),
then species could be subject to selection and thus could change their
occurrence over geological time, much as heritable selected-for traits change
theirs over generations. For evolution to be driven by species selection,
differential success must be the result of selection upon species-intrinsic
properties, rather than for properties of genes, cells, individuals, or
populations within species. Such properties include, for example, population
structure, their propensity to speciate, extinction rates, and geological
persistence. While the fossil record shows differential persistence of species,
examples of species-intrinsic properties subject to natural selection have been
much harder to document.
