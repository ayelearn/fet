****** Species concept ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The species problem is the set of questions that arises when biologists attempt
to define what a species is. Such a definition is called a species concept;
there are at least 26 recognized species concepts.[1] A species concept that
works well for sexually_reproducing organisms such as birds is useless for
species that reproduce_asexually, such as bacteria. The scientific study of the
species problem has been called microtaxonomy.[2]
One common, but sometimes difficult, question is how best to decide which
species an organism belongs to, because reproductively isolated groups may not
be readily recognizable, and cryptic_species may be present. There is a
continuum from reproductive_isolation with no interbreeding, to panmixis,
unlimited interbreeding. Populations can move forward or backwards along this
continuum, at any point meeting the criteria for one or another species
concept, and failing others.
Many of the debates on species touch on philosophical issues, such as
nominalism and realism, and on issues of language and cognition.
The current meaning of the phrase "species problem" is quite different from
what Charles_Darwin and others meant by it during the 19th and early 20th
centuries.[3] For Darwin, the species problem was the question of how_new
species_arose. Darwin was however one of the first people to question how well-
defined species are, given that they constantly change.
â[...] I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the â
    distinction between species and varieties

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: Species
**** Before Darwin[edit] ****
The idea that an organism reproduces by giving birth to a similar organism, or
producing seeds that grow to a similar organism, goes back to the earliest days
of farming. While people tended to think of this as a relatively stable
process, many thought that change was possible. The term species was just used
as a term for a sort or kind of organism, until in 1686 John_Ray introduced the
biological concept that species were distinguished by always producing the same
species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was
possible within a species.[5][6] Carolus_Linnaeus (1707â1778) formalized the
taxonomic rank of species, and devised the two part naming system of binomial
nomenclature that we use today. However, this did not prevent disagreements on
the best way to identify species.
The history of definitions of the term "species"[7][8] reveal that the seeds of
the modern species debate were alive and growing long before Darwin.
     "The traditional view, which was developed by Cain, Mayr and Hull in
     the mid-twentieth century, claims that until the âOrigin of
     speciesâ by Charles Darwin both philosophy and biology considered
     species as invariable natural kinds with essential features. This
     âessentialism storyâ was adopted by many authors, but questioned
     from the beginning by a minority â¦ when Aristotle and the early
     naturalists wrote about the essences of species, they meant essential
     âfunctionsâ, not essential âpropertiesâ. Richards pointed out
     [Richard A. Richards, The Species Problem: A Philosophical Analysis,
     Cambridge University Press, 2010] that Linnaeus saw species as
     eternally fixed in his very first publication from 1735, but only a
     few years later he discovered hybridization as a modus for
     speciation.[9]
**** From Darwin to Mayr[edit] ****
Charles_Darwin's famous book On_the_Origin_of_Species (1859) offered an
explanation as to how species evolve, given enough time. Although Darwin did
not provide details on how species can split into two, he viewed speciation as
a gradual_process. If Darwin was correct, then, when new incipient species are
forming, there must be a period of time when they are not yet distinct enough
to be recognized as species. Darwin's theory suggested that there was often not
going to be an objective fact of the matter, on whether there were one or two
species.
Darwin's book triggered a crisis of uncertainty for some biologists over the
objectivity of species, and some came to wonder whether individual species
could be objectively real â i.e. have an existence that is independent of the
human observer.[10][11]
In the 1920s and 1930s, Mendel's theory of inheritance and Darwin's theory of
evolution by natural_selection were joined in what was called the modern
synthesis. This conjunction of theories also had a large impact on how
biologists think about species. Edward_Poulton anticipated many ideas on
species that today are well accepted, and that were later more fully developed
by Theodosius_Dobzhansky and Ernst_Mayr, two of the architects of the modern
synthesis.[12] Dobzhansky's 1937 book[13] articulated the genetic processes
that occur when incipient species are beginning to diverge. In particular,
Dobzhansky described the critical role, for the formation of new species, of
the evolution of reproductive_isolation.
**** Mayr's Biological Species Concept[edit] ****
Ernst_Mayr's 1942 book was a turning point for the species problem.[14] In it,
he wrote about how different investigators approach species identification, and
he characterized their approaches as species concepts. He argued for what came
to be called the Biological Species Concept (BSC), that a species consists of
populations of organisms that can reproduce with one another and that are
reproductively isolated from other populations, though he was not the first to
define "species" on the basis of reproductive compatibility.[8] For example,
Mayr discusses how Buffon proposed this kind of definition of "species" in
1753. Theodosius_Dobzhansky was a contemporary of Mayr and the author of a
classic book about the evolutionary origins of reproductive barriers between
species, published a few years before Mayr's.[13] Many biologists credit
Dobzhansky and Mayr jointly for emphasizing reproductive isolation.[15][16]
After Mayr's book, some two dozen species concepts were introduced. Some, such
as the Phylogenetic_Species_Concept (PSC), were designed to be more useful than
the BSC for describing species. Many authors have professed to "solve" or
"dissolve" the species problem.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23] Some have argued
that the species problem is too multidimensional to be "solved" by any one
concept.[24][25] Since the 1990s, others have argued that concepts intended to
help describe species have not helped to resolve the species problem.[24][26]
[27][28][29] Although Mayr promoted the BSC for use in systematics, some
systematists have criticized it as not operational.[30][31][32][33] For others,
the BSC is the preferred definition of species. Many geneticists who work on
speciation prefer the BSC because it emphasizes the role of reproductive
isolation.[34] It has been argued that the BSC is a natural consequence of the
effect of sexual reproduction on the dynamics of natural selection.[35][36][37]
[38]
***** Philosophical aspects[edit] *****
**** Realism[edit] ****
Realism, in the context of the species problem, is the philosophical position
that species are real mind-independent entities, natural_kinds. Mayr, a
proponent of realism, attempted to demonstrate species exist as natural, extra-
mental categories. He showed for example that the New Guinean tribesman
classify 136 species of birds, which Western ornithologists came to
independently recognize:
     "I have always thought that there is no more devastating refutation
     of the nominalistic claims than the above mentioned fact that
     primitive natives in New Guinea, with a Stone Age culture, recognize
     as species exactly the same entities of nature as western
     taxonomists. If species were something purely arbitrary, it would be
     totally improbable for representatives of two drastically different
     cultures to arrive at the identical species delimitations."[39]
Mayr's argument however has been criticized:
     "The fact that independently observing humans see much the same
     species in nature does not show that species are real rather than
     nominal categories. The most it shows is that all human brains are
     wired up with a similar perceptual cluster statistic (Ridley, 1993).
     On this view we [humans] might have been âwiredâ differently and
     different species might now be wired differently from us, so that no
     one wiring can be said to be âtrueâ or veridical."[40]
Another position of realism is that natural kinds are demarcated by the world
itself by having a unique property that is shared by all the members of a
species, and none outside the group. In other words, a natural kind possesses
an essential or intrinsic feature (âessenceâ) that is self-individuating
and non-arbitrary. This notion has been heavily criticized as essentialist, but
modern realists have argued that while biological natural kinds have essences,
these need not be fixed and are prone to change through speciation.[41]
According to Mayr (1957) reproductive isolation or interbreeding "supplies an
objective yardstick, a completely non-arbitrary criterionâ and "describing a
presence or absence relationship makes this species concept non-arbitrary". The
BSC defines species as "groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural
populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups". From
this perspective, each species is based on a property (reproductive isolation)
that is shared by all the organisms in the species that objectively
distinguishes them.
**** Nominalism[edit] ****
Some philosophical variants of nominalism propose that species are just names
that people have assigned to groups of creatures but where the lines between
species get drawn does not reflect any fundamental underlying biological cut-
off point. In this view, the kinds of things that people have given names to,
do not reflect any underlying reality. It then follows that species do not
exist outside the mind, because species are just named abstractions. If species
are not real, then it would not be sensible to talk about "the origin of a
species" or the "evolution of a species". As recently at least as the 1950s,
some authors adopted this view and wrote of species as not being real.[42][43]
A counterpoint to the nominalist views in regard to species, was raised by
Michael_Ghiselin who argued that an individual species is not a type, but
rather an actual individual, an actual entity.[18][44] This idea comes from
thinking of a species as an evolving dynamic population. If viewed as an
entity, a species would exist regardless of whether or not people have observed
it and whether or not it has been given a name.
**** Pragmatism[edit] ****
A popular alternative view, pragmatism, espoused by philosophers such as Philip
Kitcher and John_Dupre states while species do not exist in the sense of
natural_kinds, they are conceptually real and exist for convenience and for
practical applications.[45] For example, regardless of which definition of
species one uses, one can still quantitatively compare species_diversity across
regions or decades, as long as the definition is held constant within a study.
This has practical importance in advancing biodiversity science and
environmental_science.
**** Language and the role of human investigators[edit] ****
The nominalist critique of the view that kinds of things exist, raises for
consideration the role that humans play in the species problem. For example,
Haldane suggested that species are just mental abstractions.[46]
Several authors have noted the similarity between "species", as a word of
ambiguous meaning, and points made by Wittgenstein on family_resemblance
concepts and the indeterminacy of language.[17][47][48]
Jody_Hey described the species problem as a result of two conflicting
motivations by biologists:[24][49]
   1. to categorize and identify organisms;
   2. to understand the evolutionary processes that give rise to species.
Under the first view, species appear to us as typical natural kinds, but when
biologists turn to understand species evolutionarily they are revealed as
changeable and without sharp boundaries. Hey argued that it is unrealistic to
expect that one definition of "species" is going to serve the need for
categorization and still reflect the changeable realities of evolving species.
**** Pluralism and monism[edit] ****
Many approaches to the species problem have attempted to develop one single
common conception of what species are and of how they should be identified. It
is thought that, if such a monistic description of species could be developed
and agreed upon, then the species problem would be solved. In contrast, some
authors have argued for pluralism, claiming that biologists cannot have just
one shared concept of species, and that they should accept multiple, seemingly
incompatible ideas about species.[50][51][52][53] David_Hull however argued
that pluralist proposals were unlikely to actually solve the species problem.

"No term is more difficult to define than "species," and on no point are
zoologists more divided than as to what should be understood by this word."
Nicholson (1872).[54]
"Of late, the futility of attempts to find a universally valid criterion for
distinguishing species has come to be fairly generally, if reluctantly,
recognized" Dobzhansky (1937).[13]
"The concept of a species is a concession to our linguistic habits and
neurological mechanisms" Haldane (1956).[46]
"An important aspect of any species definition whether in neontology or
palaeontology is that any statement that particular individuals (or fragmentary
specimens) belong to a certain species is an hypothesis (not a fact)" Bonde
(1977).[55]
"The species problem is the long-standing failure of biologists to agree on how
we should identify species and how we should define the word 'species'." Hey
(2001).[49]
"First, the species problem is not primarily an empirical one, but it is rather
fraught with philosophical questions that require â but cannot be settled by
â empirical evidence." Pigliucci (2003).[17]
"We show that although discrete phenotypic clusters exist in most [plant]
genera (> 80%), the correspondence of taxonomic species to these clusters is
poor (< 60%) and no different between plants and animals. ... Contrary to
conventional wisdom, plant species are more likely than animal species to
represent reproductively independent lineages." Rieseberg et al. (2006).[56]
