****** Nutrient cycle ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Composting within agricultural_systems capitalizes upon the natural services of
nutrient recycling in ecosystems. Bacteria, fungi, insects, earthworms, bugs,
and other creatures dig and digest the compost into fertile soil. The minerals
and nutrients in the soil is recycled back into the production of crops.
A nutrient cycle (or ecological recycling) is the movement and exchange of
organic and inorganic matter back into the production of matter. Energy flow is
a unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of mineral
nutrients is cyclic. Mineral cycles include the carbon_cycle, sulfur_cycle,
nitrogen_cycle, water_cycle, phosphorus_cycle, oxygen_cycle, among others that
continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into productive
ecological nutrition.

***** Outline[edit] *****
Fallen logs are critical components of the nutrient cycle in terrestrial
forests. Nurse_logs form habitats for other creatures that decompose the
materials and recycle the nutrients back into production.[1]
The nutrient cycle is nature's recycling system. All forms of recycling have
feedback loops that use energy in the process of putting material resources
back into use. Recycling in ecology is regulated to a large extent during the
process of decomposition.[2] Ecosystems employ biodiversity in the food webs
that recycle natural materials, such as mineral_nutrients, which includes
water. Recycling in natural systems is one of the many ecosystem_services that
sustain and contribute to the well-being of human societies.[3][4][5]
A nutrient cycle of a typical terrestrial ecosystem.
There is much overlap between the terms for the biogeochemical_cycle and
nutrient cycle. Most textbooks integrate the two and seem to treat them as
synonymous terms.[6] However, the terms often appear independently. Nutrient
cycle is more often used in direct reference to the idea of an intra-system
cycle, where an ecosystem functions as a unit. From a practical point, it does
not make sense to assess a terrestrial ecosystem by considering the full column
of air above it as well as the great depths of Earth below it. While an
ecosystem often has no clear boundary, as a working model it is practical to
consider the functional community where the bulk of matter and energy transfer
occurs.[7] Nutrient cycling occurs in ecosystems that participate in the
"larger biogeochemical cycles of the earth through a system of inputs and
outputs."[7]:425
***** Complete and closed loop[edit] *****
All systems recycle. The biosphere is a network of continually recycling
materials and information in alternating cycles of convergence and divergence.
As materials converge or become more concentrated they gain in quality,
increasing their potentials to drive useful work in proportion to their
concentrations relative to the environment. As their potentials are used,
materials diverge, or become more dispersed in the landscape, only to be
concentrated again at another time and place.[8]:2
Ecosystems are capable of complete recycling. Complete recycling means that
100% of the waste material can be reconstituted indefinitely. This idea was
captured by Howard_T._Odum when he penned that "it is thoroughly demonstrated
by ecological systems and geological systems that all the chemical elements and
many organic substances can be accumulated by living systems from background
crustal or oceanic concentrations without limit as to concentration so long as
there is available solar or another source of potential energy"[9]:29 In 1979
Nicholas_Georgescu-Roegen proposed the fourth_law_of_entropy stating that
complete recycling is impossible. Despite Georgescu-Roegen's extensive
intellectual contributions to the science of ecological_economics, the fourth
law has been rejected in line with observations of ecological recycling.[10]
[11] However, some authors state that complete recycling is impossible for
technological waste.[12]
A simplified food_web illustrating a three-trophic food chain (producers-
herbivores-carnivores) linked to decomposers. The movement of mineral_nutrients
through the food chain, into the mineral nutrient pool, and back into the
trophic_system illustrates ecological recycling. The movement of energy, in
contrast, is unidirectional and noncyclic.[13][14]
Ecosystems execute closed loop recycling where demand for the nutrients that
adds to the growth of biomass exceeds supply within that system. There are
regional and spatial differences in the rates of growth and exchange of
materials, where some ecosystems may be in nutrient debt (sinks) where others
will have extra supply (sources). These differences relate to climate,
topography, and geological history leaving behind different sources of parent
material.[7][15] In terms of a food web, a cycle or loop is defined as "a
directed sequence of one or more links starting from, and ending at, the same
species."[16]:185 An example of this is the microbial food web in the ocean,
where "bacteria are exploited, and controlled, by protozoa, including
heterotrophic microflagellates which are in turn exploited by ciliates. This
grazing activity is accompanied by excretion of substances which are in turn
used by the bacteria so that the system more or less operates in a closed
circuit."[17]:69â70
***** Ecological recycling[edit] *****
A large fraction of the elements composing living matter reside at any instant
of time in the worldâs biota. Because the earthly pool of these elements is
limited and the rates of exchange among the various components of the biota are
extremely fast with respect to geological time, it is quite evident that much
of the same material is being incorporated again and again into different
biological forms. This observation gives rise to the notion that, on the
average, matter (and some amounts of energy) are involved in cycles.[18]:219
An example of ecological recycling occurs in the enzymatic digestion of
cellulose. "Cellulose, one of the most abundant organic compounds on Earth, is
the major polysaccharide in plants where it is part of the cell walls.
Cellulose-degrading enzymes participate in the natural, ecological recycling of
plant material."[19] Different ecosystems can vary in their recycling rates of
litter, which creates a complex feedback on factors such as the competitive
dominance of certain plant species. Different rates and patterns of ecological
recycling leaves a legacy of environmental effects with implications for the
future evolution of ecosystems.[20]
Ecological recycling is common in organic farming, where nutrient management is
fundamentally different compared to agri-business styles of soil management.
Organic farms that employ ecosystem recycling to a greater extent support more
species (increased levels of biodiversity) and have a different food_web
structure.[21][22] Organic agricultural ecosystems rely on the services of
biodiversity for the recycling of nutrients through soils instead of relying on
the supplementation of synthetic_fertilizers.[23][24] The model for ecological
recycling agriculture adheres to the following principals:
    * Protection of biodiversity.
    * Use of renewable energy.
    * Recycling of plant nutrients.[25]
Where produce from an organic farm leaves the farm gate for the market the
system becomes an open cycle and nutrients may need to be replaced through
alternative methods.
**** Ecosystem engineers[edit] ****
Main article: Ecosystem_engineer
An illustration of an earthworm_casting taken from Charles_Darwin's_publication
on the movement of organic matter in soils through the ecological activities of
worms.[26]
From the largest to the smallest of creatures, nutrients are recycled by their
movement, by their wastes, and by their metabolic activities. This illustration
shows an example of the whale_pump that cycles nutrients through the layers of
the oceanic water column. Whales can migrate to great depths to feed on bottom
fish (such as sand_lance_Ammodytes_spp.) and surface to feed on krill and
plankton at shallower levels. The whale pump enhances growth and productivity
in other parts of the ecosystem.[27]
The persistent legacy of environmental feedback that is left behind by or as an
extension of the ecological actions of organisms is known as niche_construction
or ecosystem engineering. Many species leave an effect even after their death,
such as coral skeletons or the extensive habitat modifications to a wetland by
a beaver, whose components are recycled and re-used by descendants and other
species living under a different selective regime through the feedback and
agency of these legacy effects.[28][29] Ecosystem engineers can influence
nutrient cycling efficiency rates through their actions.
Earthworms, for example, passively and mechanically alter the nature of soil
environments. Bodies of dead worms passively contribute mineral nutrients to
the soil. The worms also mechanically modify the physical structure of the soil
as they crawl about (bioturbation), digest on the molds of organic matter they
pull from the soil_litter. These activities transport nutrients into the
mineral_layers_of_soil. Worms discard wastes that create worm_castings
containing undigested materials where bacteria and other decomposers gain
access to the nutrients. The earthworm is employed in this process and the
production of the ecosystem depends on their capability to create feedback
loops in the recycling process.[30][31]
Shellfish are also ecosystem engineers because they: 1) Filter suspended
particles from the water column; 2) Remove excess nutrients from coastal bays
through denitrification; 3) Serve as natural coastal buffers, absorbing wave
energy and reducing erosion from boat wakes, sea level rise and storms; 4)
Provide nursery habitat for fish that are valuable to coastal economies.[32]
Fungi contribute to nutrient_cycling[33] and nutritionally rearrange patches of
ecosystem creating niches for other organisms.[34] In that way fungi in growing
dead_wood allow xylophages to grow and develop and xylophages, in turn, affect
dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient_cycling in the
forest_floor.[35]
***** History[edit] *****
Nutrient cycling has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles_Darwin in
reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms. Darwin wrote about "the
continued Following the Greeks, the idea of a hydrological cycle (water is
considered a nutrient) was validated and quantified by Halley in 1687.
**** Variations in terminology[edit] ****
In 1926 Vernadsky coined the term biogeochemistry as a sub-discipline of
geochemistry.[36] However, the term nutrient cycle pre-dates biogeochemistry in
a pamphlet on silviculture in 1899: "These demands by no means pass over the
fact that at places where sufficient quantities of humus are available and
where, in case of continuous decomposition of litter, a stable, nutrient humus
is present, considerable quantities of nutrients are also available from the
biogenic nutrient cycle for the standing timber.[37]:12 In 1898 there is a
reference to the nitrogen cycle in relation to nitrogen_fixing_microorganisms.
[38] Other uses and variations on the terminology relating to the process of
nutrient cycling appear throughout history:
    * The term mineral cycle appears early in a 1935 in reference to the
      importance of minerals in plant_physiology: "...ash is probably either
      built up into its permanent structure, or deposited in some way as waste
      in the cells, and so may not be free to re-enter the mineral cycle."[39]:
      301
    * The term nutrient recycling appears in a 1964 paper on the food ecology
      of the wood stork: "While the periodic drying up and reflooding of the
      marshes creates special survival problems for organisms in the community,
      the fluctuating water levels favor rapid nutrient recycling and
      subsequent high rates of primary and secondary production"[40]:97
    * The term natural cycling appears in a 1968 paper on the transportation of
      leaf litter and its chemical elements for consideration in fisheries
      management: "Fluvial transport of tree litter from drainage basins is a
      factor in natural cycling of chemical elements and in degradation of the
      land."[41]:131
    * The term ecological recycling appears in a 1968 publication on future
      applications of ecology for the creation of different modules designed
      for living in extreme environments, such as space or under sea: "For our
      basic requirement of recycling vital resources, the oceans provide much
      more frequent ecological recycling than the land area. Fish and other
      organic populations have higher growth rates, vegetation has less
      capricious weather problems for sea harvesting."[42]
    * The term bio-recycling appears in a 1976 paper on the recycling of
      organic carbon in oceans: "Following the actualistic assumption, then,
      that biological activity is responsible for the source of dissolved
      organic material in the oceans, but is not important for its activities
      after death of the organisms and subsequent chemical changes which
      prevent its bio-recycling, we can see no major difference in the behavior
      of dissolved organic matter between the prebiotic and post-biotic
      oceans."[43]:414
Water is also a nutrient.[44] In this context, some authors also refer to
precipitation recycling, which "is the contribution of evaporation within a
region to precipitation in that same region."[45] These variations on the theme
of nutrient cycling continue to be used and all refer to processes that are
part of the global biogeochemical cycles. However, authors tend to refer to
natural, organic, ecological, or bio-recycling in reference to the work of
nature, such as it is used in organic farming or ecological agricultural
systems.[25]
***** Recycling in novel ecosystems[edit] *****
See also: ecotoxicology and novel_ecosystem
An endless stream of technological waste accumulates in different spatial
configurations across the planet and turns into a predator in our soils, our
streams, and our oceans.[46][47] This idea was similarly expressed in 1954 by
ecologist Paul_Sears: "We do not know whether to cherish the forest as a source
of essential raw materials and other benefits or to remove it for the space it
occupies. We expect a river to serve as both vein and artery carrying away
waste but bringing usable material in the same channel. Nature long ago
discarded the nonsense of carrying poisonous wastes and nutrients in the same
vessels."[48]:960 Ecologists use population_ecology to model contaminants as
competitors or predators.[49] Rachel_Carson was an ecological pioneer in this
area as her book Silent_Spring inspired research into biomagification and
brought to the worlds attention the unseen pollutants moving into the food
chains of the planet.[50]
In contrast to the planets natural ecosystems, technology (or technoecosystems)
is not reducing its impact on planetary resources.[51][52] Only 7% of total
plastic_waste (adding up to millions upon millions of tons) is being recycled
by industrial systems; the 93% that never makes it into the industrial
recycling stream is presumably absorbed by natural recycling systems[53] In
contrast and over extensive lengths of time (billions of years) ecosystems have
maintained a consistent balance with production roughly equaling respiratory
consumption rates. The balanced recycling efficiency of nature means that
production of decaying waste material has exceeded rates of recyclable
consumption into food chains equal to the global stocks of fossilized_fuels
that escaped the chain of decomposition.[54]
Pesticides soon spread through everything in the ecosphere-both human
technosphere and nonhuman biosphere-returning from the 'out there' of natural
environments back into plant, animal, and human bodies situated at the 'in
here' of artificial environments with unintended, unanticipated, and unwanted
effects. By using zoological, toxicological, epidemiological, and ecological
insights, Carson generated a new sense of how 'the environment' might be seen.
[55]:62
Microplastics and nanosilver materials flowing and cycling through ecosystems
from pollution and discarded technology are among a growing list of emerging
ecological concerns.[56] For example, unique assemblages of marine microbes
have been found to digest plastic accumulating in the worlds oceans.[57]
Discarded technology is absorbed into soils and creates a new class of soils
called technosols.[58] Human wastes in the Anthropocene are creating new
systems of ecological recycling, novel ecosystems that have to contend with the
mercury_cycle and other synthetic materials that are streaming into the
biodegradation chain.[59] Microorganisms have a significant role in the removal
of synthetic organic compounds from the environment empowered by recycling
mechanisms that have complex biodegradation pathways. The effect of synthetic
materials, such as nanoparticles and microplastics, on ecological recycling
systems is listed as one of the major concerns for ecosystem in this century.
[56][60]
**** Technological recycling[edit] ****
Main article: Recycling
Recycling_in_human_industrial_systems (or technoecosystems) differs from
ecological recycling in scale, complexity, and organization. Industrial
recycling systems do not focus on the employment of ecological food webs to
recycle waste back into different kinds of marketable goods, but primarily
employ people and technodiversity instead. Some researchers have questioned the
premise behind these and other kinds of technological solutions under the
banner of 'eco-efficiency' are limited in their capability, harmful to
ecological processes, and dangerous in their hyped capabilities.[12][61] Many
technoecosystems are competitive and parasitic toward natural ecosystems.[54]
[62] Food web or biologically based "recycling includes metabolic recycling
(nutrient recovery, storage, etc.) and ecosystem recycling (leaching and in
situ organic matter mineralization, either in the water column, in the sediment
surface, or within the sediment."[63]:243
