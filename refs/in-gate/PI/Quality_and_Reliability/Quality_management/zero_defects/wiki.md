Zero Defects (or ZD) was a management-led program to eliminate defects in
industrial production that enjoyed brief popularity in American industry from
1964[1] to the early 1970s. Quality expert Philip_Crosby later incorporated it
into his "Absolutes of Quality Management" and it enjoyed a renaissance in the
American automobile industryâas a performance goal more than as a
programâin the 1990s. Although applicable to any type of enterprise, it has
been primarily adopted within supply_chains wherever large volumes of
components are being purchased (common items such as nuts and bolts are good
examples).

***** Definition[edit] *****
     "[...] Zero Defects is a management tool aimed at the reduction of
     defects through prevention. It is directed at motivating people to
     prevent mistakes by developing a constant, conscious desire to do
     their job right the first time."[2]:vii â Zero Defects: A New
     Dimension in Quality Assurance
Zero Defects seeks to directly reverse the attitude that the number of mistakes
a worker makes doesn't matter since inspectors will catch them before they
reach the customer.[2]:4 This stands in contrast to activities that affect the
worker directly, such as receiving a paycheck in the correct amount. Zero
Defects involves reconditioning the worker "to take a personal interest in
everything he does[,] by convincing him that his job is just as important as
the task of the doctor or the dentist."[2]:4
***** History[edit] *****
The development of Zero Defects is credited to Philip_B._Crosby, a quality
control department manager on the Pershing_missile program at the Martin
Company,[3] though at least one contemporary reference credits a small, unnamed
group of Martin employees.[4]
Zero Defects is not the first application of motivational techniques to
production: During World War II, the War_Department's "E_for_Excellence"
program sought to boost production and minimize waste.[5][6][7]

The Cold_War resulted in increased spending on the development of defense
technology in the 1950s and 1960s. Because of the safety-critical nature of
such technology, particularly weapons systems, the government and defense firms
came to employ hundreds of thousands of people in inspection and monitoring of
highly-complex products assembled from hundreds of thousands of individual
parts.[2]:10 This activity routinely uncovered defects in design, manufacture,
and assembly and resulted in an expensive, drawn out cycle of inspection,
rework, reinspection, and retest.[2]:12 Additionally, reports of spectacular
missile failures appearing in the press[note_1] heightened the pressure to
eliminate defects.
In 1961, the Martin Company's Orlando Florida facility embarked on an effort to
increase quality awareness and specifically launched a program to drive down
the number of defects in the Pershing missile to one half of the acceptable
quality_level in half a year's time.[2]:12 Subsequently, the Army asked that
the missile be delivered a month earlier than the contract date in 1962. Martin
marshaled all of its resources to meet this challenge and delivered the system
with no discrepancies in hardware and documentation and were able to
demonstrate operation within a day of the start of setup.[2]:14Â¡V15 After
reviewing how Martin was able to overachieve, its management came to the
conclusion that while it had not insisted on perfection in the past, it had in
this instance, and that was all that was needed to attain outstanding product
quality.[2]:15
Management commissioned a team to examine the phenomenon and come up with an
action plan, which became the organizing, motivating, and initiating elements
of Zero Defects.[2]:15 The Department of Defense also took notice and in 1964,
began to actively encourage its vendors to adopt Zero Defects programs.[8][9]
Interest in the program from outside firms, including Litton_Industries,
Thiokol, Westinghouse, and Bendix_Corporation,[2]:16 was keen and many made
visits to Martin to learn about it.[2]:16 Their feedback was incorporated and
rounded out the program. In particular, General_Electric suggested that error
cause removal be included in the program.[2]:16
Martin claimed a 54% defect reduction in defects in hardware under government
audit during the first two years of the program. General Electric reported a $2
million reduction in rework and scrap costs, RCA reported 75% of its
departments in one division were achieving Zero Defects, and Sperry_Corporation
reported a 54% defect reduction over a single year.[2]:17
During its heyday, it was adopted by General_Electric, ITT_Corporation,
Montgomery_Ward, Rolls-Royce_Limited, and the United_States_Army among other
organizations.[10]
While Zero Defects began in the aerospace and defense industry, thirty years
later it was regenerated in the automotive world. During the 1990s, large
companies in the automotive_industry tried to cut costs by reducing their
quality inspection processes and demanding that their suppliers dramatically
improve the quality of their supplies. This eventually resulted in demands for
the "Zero Defects" standard. It is implemented all over the world.
***** Later developments[edit] *****
In 1979, Crosby penned Quality Is Free: The Art of Making Quality Certain which
preserved the idea of Zero Defects in a Quality_Management_Maturity_Grid, in a
14-step quality improvement program, and in the concept of the "Absolutes of
Quality Management".[11] The quality improvement program incorporated ideas
developed or popularized by others (for example, cost_of_quality (step 4),
employee education (step 8), and quality_councils (step 13)) with the core
motivation techniques of booklets, films, posters, speeches, and the "ZD Day"
centerpiece.[12]
**** Absolutes of Quality Management[edit] ****
According to Crosby, there are four Absolutes:[13]
*** 1. "The definition of quality is conformance to requirements"[edit] ***
Newcomers to manufacturing bring their own vague impressions of what quality
involves. But in order to tackle quality-related problems, there must be
widespread agreement on the specifics of what quality means for a particular
product. Customer needs and expectations must be reduced to measurable
quantities like length, or smoothness, or roundness and a standard must be
specified for each. These become the requirements for a product and the
organization must inspect, or measure what comes out of the production process
against those standards to determine whether the product conforms to those
requirements or not.[11]:17 An important implication of this is that if
management does not specify these requirements workers invent their own which
may not align with what management would have intended had they provided
explicit requirements to begin with.[14]:78
*** 2. "The system of quality is prevention"[edit] ***
Companies typically focus on inspection to ensure that defective product
doesn't reach the customer. But this is both costly and still lets
nonconformances through.[15] Prevention, in the form of "pledging ourselves to
make a constant conscious effort to do our jobs right the first time", is the
only way to guarantee zero defects. Beyond that, examining the production
process for steps where defects can occur and mistake_proofing them contributes
to defect-free production.[16][17]
*** 3. "The performance standard is Zero Defects"[edit] ***
Workers, at least during the postâWorld_War_II_economic_expansion, had a
lackadaisical attitude on the whole toward work. Crosby saw statistical_quality
control and the MIL-Q-9858 standard as contributing to this through acceptable
quality_levelsâa concept that allows a certain number of acceptable defects
and reinforces the attitude that mistakes are inevitable.[14]:80[18]:79-80
Another contributor is the self-imposed pressure to produce something to sell,
even if that thing is defective.[12]:72-73 Workers must "make the attitude of
Zero Defects [their] personal standard."[18]:172
*** 4. "The measurement of quality is the price of nonconformance"[edit] ***
To convince executives to take action to resolve issues of poor quality, costs
associated with poor quality must be measured in monetary terms.[19][11]:121
Crosby uses the term "the price of nonconformance" in preference to "the_cost
of_quality" to overcome the misimpression that higher quality requires higher
costs.[18] The point of writing Quality Is Free was to demonstrate that quality
improvement efforts pay for themselves.[20] Crosby divides quality-related
costs into the price of conformance and the price of nonconformance. The price
of conformance includes quality-related planning, inspection, and auditing; the
price of nonconformance includes scrap, rework, claims against warranty,
unplanned service[11]:209
***** Criticisms[edit] *****
The main criticism is the amount of effort required to verify every person's
performance in an organization.[2]:121 Confidence in the program, and therefore
compliance to it, fades without this verification.[2]:118[21]
Point 10 of Deming's_14_points ("Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets
for the work force asking forzero defectsand new levels of productivity.") is
clearly aimed at ZD.[22][23] Joseph_M._Juran was also critical of ZD.[24]
Another criticism is that Zero Defects is a motivational program aimed at
encouraging employees to do better.[25][26][27] Crosby stated that "Motivation
has nothing to do with it...It is merely setting performance standards that no
one can misunderstand and then starting a two-way communications exercise to
let everyone know about it."[28] He blamed management actions and attitudes for
creating the opportunity for defects.[29][30]

      never responded, even though it should be fairly obvious to anyone who
      has ever read anyting I have written or has hard me speak that I hold
      management responsible for the whole mess.
