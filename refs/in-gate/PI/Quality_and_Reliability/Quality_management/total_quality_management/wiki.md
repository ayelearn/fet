Total quality management (TQM) consists of organization-wide efforts to
"install and make permanent climate where employees continuously_improve their
ability to provide on demand products and services that customers will find of
particular value."[1] "Total" emphasizes that departments in addition to
production (for example sales and marketing, accounting and finance,
engineering and design) are obligated to improve their operations; "management"
emphasizes that executives are obligated to actively manage quality through
funding, training, staffing, and goal setting. While there is no widely agreed-
upon approach, TQM efforts typically draw heavily on the previously developed
tools and techniques of quality_control. TQM enjoyed widespread attention
during the late 1980s and early 1990s before being overshadowed by ISO_9000,
Lean_manufacturing, and Six_Sigma.

***** History[edit] *****
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the developed countries of North America and
Western Europe suffered_economically in the face of stiff competition from
Japan's ability_to_produce_high-quality_goods_at_competitive_cost. For the
first time since the start of the Industrial_Revolution, the United Kingdom
became a net importer of finished goods. The United States undertook its own
soul-searching, expressed most pointedly in the television broadcast of If
Japan_Can..._Why_Can't_We?. Firms began reexamining the techniques of quality
control invented over the past 50 years and how those techniques had been so
successfully employed by the Japanese. It was in the midst of this economic
turmoil that TQM took root.
The exact origin of the term "total quality management" is uncertain.[2] It is
almost certainly inspired by Armand_V._Feigenbaum's multi-edition book Total
Quality Control (
OCLC 299383303) and Kaoru_Ishikawa's What Is Total Quality Control? The
Japanese Way (
OCLC 11467749). It may have been first coined in the United Kingdom by the
Department_of_Trade_and_Industry during its 1983 "National Quality Campaign".
[2] Or it may have been first coined in the United States by the Naval_Air
Systems_Command to describe its quality-improvement efforts in 1985.[2]
**** Development in the United States[edit] ****
In the spring of 1984, an arm of the United_States_Navy asked some of its
civilian researchers to assess statistical_process_control and the work of
several prominent quality consultants and to make recommendations as to how to
apply their approaches to improve the Navy's operational effectiveness.[3] The
recommendation was to adopt the teachings of W._Edwards_Deming.[3][4] The Navy
branded the effort "Total Quality Management" in 1985.[3][Note_1]
From the Navy, TQM spread throughout the US Federal Government, resulting in
the following:
    * The creation of the Malcolm_Baldrige_National_Quality_Award in August
      1987
    * The creation of the Federal Quality Institute in June 1988
    * The adoption of TQM by many elements of government and the armed forces,
      including the United_States_Department_of_Defense,[5] United_States_Army,
      [6] and United_States_Coast_Guard[7]
The US_Environmental_Protection_Agency's Underground Storage Tanks program,
which was established in 1985, also employed Total Quality Management to
develop its management style.[8] The private sector followed suit, flocking to
TQM principles not only as a means to recapture market share from the Japanese,
but also to remain competitive when bidding for contracts from the Federal
Government[9] since "total quality" requires involving suppliers, not just
employees, in process improvement efforts.
***** Features[edit] *****
There is no widespread agreement as to what TQM is and what actions it requires
of organizations,[10][11][12] however a review of the original United States
Navy effort gives a rough understanding of what is involved in TQM.
The key concepts in the TQM effort undertaken by the Navy in the 1980s include:
[13]
    * "Quality is defined by customers' requirements."
    * "Top management has direct responsibility for quality improvement."
    * "Increased quality comes from systematic analysis and improvement of work
      processes."
    * "Quality improvement is a continuous effort and conducted throughout the
      organization."
The Navy used the following tools and techniques:
    * The PDCA cycle to drive issues to resolution
    * Ad hoc cross-functional teams (similar to quality_circles) responsible
      for addressing immediate process issues
    * Standing cross-functional teams responsible for the improvement of
      processes over the long term
    * Active management participation through steering committees
    * Use of the Seven_Basic_Tools_of_Quality to analyze quality-related issues
**** Notable definitions[edit] ****
While there is no generally accepted definition of TQM, several notable
organizations have attempted to define it. These include:
*** United_States_Department_of_Defense (1988)[edit] ***
     "Total Quality Management (TQM) in the Department of Defense is a
     strategy for continuously improving performance at every level, and
     in all areas of responsibility. It combines fundamental management
     techniques, existing improvement efforts, and specialized technical
     tools under a disciplined structure focused on continuously improving
     all processes. Improved performance is directed at satisfying such
     broad goals as cost, quality, schedule, and mission need and
     suitability. Increasing user satisfaction is the overriding
     objective. The TQM effort builds on the pioneering work of Dr._W._E.
     Deming, Dr._J._M._Juran, and others, and benefits from both private
     and public sector experience with continuous process improvement."
     [14]
*** British_Standards_Institution standard BS 7850-1:1992[edit] ***
     "A management philosophy and company practices that aim to harness
     the human and material resources of an organization in the most
     effective way to achieve the objectives of the organization."[15]
*** International_Organization_for_Standardization standard ISO 8402:1994[edit]
***
     "A management approach of an organisation centred on quality, based
     on the participation of all its members and aiming at long term
     success through customer satisfaction and benefits to all members of
     the organisation and society."[16]
*** The American_Society_for_Quality[edit] ***
     "A term first used to describe a management approach to quality
     improvement. Since then, TQM has taken on many meanings. Simply put,
     it is a management approach to long-term success through customer
     satisfaction. TQM is based on all members of an organization
     participating in improving processes, products, services and the
     culture in which they work. The methods for implementing this
     approach are found in the teachings of such quality leaders as Philip
     B._Crosby, W._Edwards_Deming, Armand_V._Feigenbaum, Kaoru_Ishikawa
     and Joseph_M._Juran."[17]
*** The Chartered_Quality_Institute[edit] ***
     "TQM is a philosophy for managing an organisation in a way which
     enables it to meet stakeholder needs and expectations efficiently and
     effectively, without compromising ethical values."[18]
*** Baldrige_Excellence_Framework[edit] ***
In the United States, the Baldrige Award, created by Public Law 100-107,
annually recognizes American businesses, education institutions, health care
organizations, and government or nonprofit organizations that are role models
for organizational performance excellence. Organizations are judged on criteria
from seven categories:[19]
   1. Leadership
   2. Strategy
   3. Customers
   4. Measurement, analysis, and knowledge management
   5. Workforce
   6. Operations
   7. Results
Example criteria are:[20]
    * How do you obtain information on your customersâ satisfaction relative
      to their satisfaction with your competitors?
    * How do you select, collect, align, and integrate data and information for
      tracking daily operations?
    * How do you manage your workforce, its needs, and your needs to ensure
      continuity, prevent workforce reductions, and minimize the impact of
      workforce reductions, if they do become necessary?
Joseph_M._Juran believed the Baldrige Award judging criteria to be the most
widely accepted description of what TQM entails.[10]:650
**** Standards[edit] ****
During the 1990s, standards bodies in Belgium, France, Germany, Turkey, and the
United Kingdom attempted to standardize TQM. While many of these standards have
since been explicitly withdrawn, they all are effectively superseded by ISO
9000:

***** Legacy[edit] *****
Interest in TQM as an academic subject peaked around 1993.[2]
The Federal Quality Institute was shuttered in September 1995 as part of the
Clinton_administration's efforts to streamline_government.[21] The European
Centre for Total Quality Management closed in August 2009, a casualty of the
Great_Recession.[22]
TQM, as a vaguely defined quality management approach, was largely supplanted
by the ISO_9000 collection of standards and their formal certification
processes in the 1990s. Business interest in quality improvement under the TQM
name also faded as Jack_Welch's success attracted attention to Six_Sigma and
Toyota's success attracted attention to lean_manufacturing, though the three
share many of the same tools, techniques, and significant portions of the same
philosophy.
TQM lives on in various national_quality_awards around the globe.[23]
***** Criticism[edit] *****
The social scientist Bettina Warzecha (2017)[24] describes the central concepts
of Quality Management (QM), such as process orientation, controllability, and
zero defects as modern myths. She demonstrates that zero-error processes and
the associated illusion of controllability involve the epistemological problem
of self-referentiality.[clarification_needed] The emphasis on the processes in
QM also ignores the artificiality and thus arbitrariness of the difference
between structure and process.[example_needed] Above all, the complexity of
management cannot be reduced to standardized (mathematical) procedures.[example
needed] According to her, the risks and negative side effects of QM are usually
greater than the benefits (see also brand eins, 2010).[25]

      widely used that it has become the number one buzzphrase to describe a
      new type of quality-oriented management. Thus, the name TQM now covers a
      very broad tent encompassing all sorts of management practices. In my
      management advisory activities I run into scores of these different
      programs all parading under the same name. Few are alike, and those
      varied programs have a wide variety of featuresâa mixture of the old
      and the newâwith, in more cases than not, very little of the new. ...
      However, I have forewarned you there are almost as many different TQM
      programs as there are companies that have started them because that
      creates confusion about what to do in your own case.
