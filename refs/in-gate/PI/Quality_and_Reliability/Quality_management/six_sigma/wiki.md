Six Sigma (6Ï) is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It
was introduced by engineer Bill_Smith while working at Motorola in 1980.[1][2]
Jack_Welch made it central to his business strategy at General_Electric in
1995. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to
produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of
defects.
Six Sigma strategies seek to improve the quality of the output of a process by
identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in
manufacturing and business_processes. It uses a set of quality_management
methods, mainly empirical, statistical_methods, and creates a special
infrastructure of people within the organization who are experts in these
methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a
defined sequence of steps and has specific value targets, for example: reduce
process cycle time, reduce pollution, reduce costs, increase customer
satisfaction, and increase profits.
The term Six Sigma (capitalized because it was written that way when registered
as a Motorola trademark on December 28, 1993) originated from terminology
associated with statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity
of a manufacturing process can be described by a sigma rating indicating its
yield or the percentage of defect-free products it createsâspecifically,
within how many standard deviations of a normal_distribution the fraction of
defect-free outcomes corresponds to. Motorola set a goal of "six sigma" for all
of its manufacturing.

***** Doctrine[edit] *****
The common Six Sigma symbol
Six Sigma doctrine asserts:
    * Continuous efforts to achieve stable and predictable process results
      (e.g. by reducing process variation) are of vital importance to business
      success.
    * Manufacturing and business processes have characteristics that can be
      defined, measured, analyzed, improved, and controlled.
    * Achieving sustained quality improvement requires commitment from the
      entire organization, particularly from top-level management.
Features that set Six Sigma apart from previous quality-improvement initiatives
include:
    * A clear focus on achieving measurable and quantifiable financial returns
      from any Six Sigma project.
    * An increased emphasis on strong and passionate management leadership and
      support.
    * A clear commitment to making decisions on the basis of verifiable data
      and statistical methods, rather than assumptions and guesswork.
The term "six sigma" comes from statistics and is used in statistical_quality
control, which evaluates process_capability. Originally, it referred to the
ability of manufacturing processes to produce a very high proportion of output
within specification. Processes that operate with "six sigma quality" over the
short term are assumed to produce long-term defect levels below 3.4 defects_per
million_opportunities (DPMO). The 3.4 dpmo is based on a "shift" of Â± 1.5
sigma created by the psychologist Dr Mikel Harry. He created this figure based
on the tolerance in the height of a stack of discs.[3][4] Six Sigma's implicit
goal is to improve all processes, but not to the 3.4 DPMO level necessarily.
Organizations need to determine an appropriate sigma level for each of their
most important processes and strive to achieve these. As a result of this goal,
it is incumbent on management of the organization to prioritize areas of
improvement.
"Six Sigma" was registered June 11, 1991 as U.S._Service_Mark_1,647,704. In
2005 Motorola attributed over US$17 billion in savings to Six Sigma.[5]
Other early adopters of Six Sigma include Honeywell and General_Electric, where
Jack_Welch introduced the method.[6] By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the
Fortune_500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of
reducing costs and improving quality.[7]
In recent years[update], some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with
lean_manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean_Six_Sigma.[8] The Lean
Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow
and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as
complementary disciplines aimed at promoting "business and operational
excellence".[8]
In 2011, the International_Organization_for_Standardization (ISO) has published
the first standard "ISO 13053:2011" defining a Six Sigma process.[9] Other
standards have been created mostly by universities or companies that have
first-party certification programs for Six Sigma.
***** Difference from lean management[edit] *****
Lean_management and Six Sigma are two concepts which share similar
methodologies and tools. Both programs are Japanese-influenced, but they are
two different programs. Lean management is focused on eliminating waste using a
set of proven standardized tools and methodologies that target organizational
efficiencies, while Six Sigma's focus is on eliminating defects and reducing
variation. Both systems are driven by data though Six Sigma is much more
dependent on accurate data.
***** Methodologies[edit] *****
Six Sigma projects follow two project methodologies inspired by Deming's
PlanâDoâStudyâAct_Cycle. These methodologies, composed of five phases
each, bear the acronyms DMAIC and DMADV.[7]
    * DMAIC ("duh-may-ick", /dÉ.ËmeÉª.Éªk/) is used for projects aimed at
      improving an existing business process.[7]
    * DMADV ("duh-mad-vee", /dÉ.ËmÃ¦d.vi/) is used for projects aimed at
      creating new product or process designs.[7]
**** DMAIC[edit] ****
The five steps of DMAIC
Main article: DMAIC
The DMAIC project methodology has five phases:
    * Define the system, the voice of the customer and their requirements, and
      the project goals, specifically.
    * Measure key aspects of the current process and collect relevant data;
      calculate the 'as-is' Process Capability.
    * Analyze the data to investigate and verify cause-and-effect
      relationships. Determine what the relationships are, and attempt to
      ensure that all factors have been considered. Seek out root cause of the
      defect under investigation.
    * Improve or optimize the current process based upon data analysis using
      techniques such as design_of_experiments, poka_yoke or mistake proofing,
      and standard work to create a new, future state process. Set up pilot
      runs to establish process_capability.
    * Control the future state process to ensure that any deviations from the
      target are corrected before they result in defects. Implement control
      systems such as statistical_process_control, production boards, visual
      workplaces, and continuously monitor the process. This process is
      repeated until the desired quality level is obtained.
Some organizations add a Recognize step at the beginning, which is to recognize
the right problem to work on, thus yielding an RDMAIC methodology.[10]
**** DMADV or DFSS[edit] ****
The five steps of DMADV
Main article: DFSS
The DMADV project methodology, known as DFSS ("Design For Six Sigma"),[7]
features five phases:
    * Define design goals that are consistent with customer demands and the
      enterprise strategy.
    * Measure and identify CTQs (characteristics that are Critical To Quality),
      measure product capabilities, production process capability, and measure
      risks.
    * Analyze to develop and design alternatives
    * Design an improved alternative, best suited per analysis in the previous
      step
    * Verify the design, set up pilot runs, implement the production process
      and hand it over to the process owner(s).
**** Quality management tools and methods[edit] ****
Within the individual phases of a DMAIC or DMADV project, Six Sigma utilizes
many established quality-management tools that are also used outside Six Sigma.

***** Implementation roles[edit] *****
One key innovation of Six Sigma involves the absolute "professionalizing" of
quality management functions. Prior to Six Sigma, quality management in
practice was largely relegated to the production floor and to statisticians in
a separate quality department. Formal Six Sigma programs adopt a kind of elite
ranking terminology (similar to some martial arts systems, like judo) to define
a hierarchy (and special career path) that includes all business functions and
levels.
Six Sigma identifies several key roles for its successful implementation.[11]
    * Executive Leadership includes the CEO and other members of top
      management. They are responsible for setting up a vision for Six Sigma
      implementation. They also empower the other role holders with the freedom
      and resources to explore new ideas for breakthrough improvements by
      transcending departmental barriers and overcoming inherent resistance to
      change.[12]
    * Champions take responsibility for Six Sigma implementation across the
      organization in an integrated manner. The Executive Leadership draws them
      from upper management. Champions also act as mentors to Black Belts.
    * Master Black Belts, identified by Champions, act as in-house coaches on
      Six Sigma. They devote 100% of their time to Six Sigma. They assist
      Champions and guide Black Belts and Green Belts. Apart from statistical
      tasks, they spend their time on ensuring consistent application of Six
      Sigma across various functions and departments.
    * Black Belts operate under Master Black Belts to apply Six Sigma
      methodology to specific projects. They devote 100% of their valued time
      to Six Sigma. They primarily focus on Six Sigma project execution and
      special leadership with special tasks, whereas Champions and Master Black
      Belts focus on identifying projects/functions for Six Sigma.
    * Green Belts are the employees who take up Six Sigma implementation along
      with their other job responsibilities, operating under the guidance of
      Black Belts.
According to proponents of the system, special training is needed[13] for all
of these practitioners to ensure that they follow the methodology and use the
data-driven approach correctly.
Some organizations use additional belt colours, such as Yellow Belts, for
employees that have basic training in Six Sigma tools and generally participate
in projects and "White belts" for those locally trained in the concepts but do
not participate in the project team. "Orange belts" are also mentioned to be
used for special cases.[14]
**** Certification[edit] ****
Main article: List_of_Six_Sigma_certification_organizations
General Electric and Motorola developed certification programs as part of their
Six Sigma implementation, verifying individuals' command of the Six Sigma
methods at the relevant skill level (Green Belt, Black Belt etc.). Following
this approach, many organizations in the 1990s started offering Six Sigma
certifications to their employees. In 2008 Motorola University later co-
developed with Vative and the Lean Six Sigma Society of Professionals a set of
comparable certification standards for Lean Certification.[7][15] Criteria for
Green Belt and Black Belt certification vary; some companies simply require
participation in a course and a Six Sigma project.[15] There is no standard
certification body, and different certification services are offered by various
quality associations and other providers against a fee.[16][17][self-published
source] The American_Society_for_Quality for example requires Black Belt
applicants to pass a written exam and to provide a signed affidavit stating
that they have completed two projects or one project combined with three years'
practical experience in the body of knowledge.[15][18]
***** Etymology of "six sigma process"[edit] *****
The term "six sigma process" comes from the notion that if one has six standard
deviations between the process mean and the nearest specification limit, as
shown in the graph, practically no[failed_verification] items will fail to meet
specifications.[3] This is based on the calculation method employed in process
capability_studies.
Capability studies measure the number of standard deviations between the
process mean and the nearest specification limit in sigma units, represented by
the Greek letter Ï (sigma). As process standard deviation goes up, or the mean
of the process moves away from the center of the tolerance, fewer standard
deviations will fit between the mean and the nearest specification limit,
decreasing the sigma number and increasing the likelihood of items outside
specification. One should also note that calculation of Sigma levels for a
process data is independent of the data being normally distributed. In one of
the criticisms to Six Sigma, practitioners using this approach spend a lot of
time transforming data from non-normal to normal using transformation
techniques. It must be said that Sigma levels can be determined for process
data that has evidence of non-normality.[3]
Graph of the normal_distribution, which underlies the statistical assumptions
of the Six Sigma model. In the centre at 0, the Greek letter Î¼ (mu) marks the
mean, with the horizontal axis showing distance from the mean, marked in
standard_deviations and given the letter Ï (sigma). The greater the standard
deviation, the greater is the spread of values encountered. For the green curve
shown above, Î¼ = 0 and Ï = 1. The upper and lower specification limits
(marked USL and LSL) are at a distance of 6Ï from the mean. Because of the
properties of the normal distribution, values lying that far away from the mean
are extremely unlikely: approximately 1 in a billion too low, and the same too
high. Even if the mean were to move right or left by 1.5Ï at some point in the
future (1.5 sigma shift, coloured red and blue), there is still a good safety
cushion. This is why Six Sigma aims to have processes where the mean is at
least 6Ï away from the nearest specification limit.
***** Role of the 1.5 sigma shift[edit] *****
Experience has shown that processes usually do not perform as well in the long
term as they do in the short term.[3] As a result, the number of sigmas that
will fit between the process mean and the nearest specification limit may well
drop over time, compared to an initial short-term study.[3] To account for this
real-life increase in process variation over time, an empirically based 1.5
sigma shift is introduced into the calculation.[3][19] According to this idea,
a process that fits 6 sigma between the process mean and the nearest
specification limit in a short-term study will in the long term fit only 4.5
sigma â either because the process mean will move over time, or because the
long-term standard deviation of the process will be greater than that observed
in the short term, or both.[3]
Hence the widely accepted definition of a six sigma process is a process that
produces 3.4 defective_parts_per_million_opportunities (DPMO). This is based on
the fact that a process that is normally_distributed will have 3.4 parts per
million outside the limits, when the limits are six sigma from the "original"
mean of zero and the process mean is then shifted by 1.5 sigma (and therefore,
the six sigma limits are no longer symmetrical about the mean).[3] The former
six sigma distribution, when under the effect of the 1.5 sigma shift, is
commonly referred to as a 4.5 sigma process. The failure rate of a six sigma
distribution with the mean shifted 1.5 sigma is not equivalent to the failure
rate of a 4.5 sigma process with the mean centered on zero.[3] This allows for
the fact that special causes may result in a deterioration in process
performance over time and is designed to prevent underestimation of the defect
levels likely to be encountered in real-life operation.[3]
The role of the sigma shift is mainly academic. The purpose of six sigma is to
generate organizational performance improvement. It is up to the organization
to determine, based on customer expectations, what the appropriate sigma level
of a process is. The purpose of the sigma value is as a comparative figure to
determine whether a process is improving, deteriorating, stagnant or non-
competitive with others in the same business. Six sigma (3.4 DPMO) is not the
goal of all processes.
**** Sigma levels[edit] ****
A control_chart depicting a process that experienced a 1.5 sigma drift in the
process mean toward the upper specification limit starting at midnight. Control
charts are used to maintain 6 sigma quality by signaling when quality
professionals should investigate a process to find and eliminate special-cause
variation.
See also: Three_sigma_rule
The table below gives long-term DPMO values corresponding to various short-term
sigma levels.[20][21]
These figures assume that the process mean will shift by 1.5 sigma toward the
side with the critical specification limit. In other words, they assume that
after the initial study determining the short-term sigma level, the long-term
Cpk_value will turn out to be 0.5 less than the short-term Cpk value. So, now
for example, the DPMO figure given for 1 sigma assumes that the long-term
process mean will be 0.5 sigma beyond the specification limit (Cpk = â0.17),
rather than 1 sigma within it, as it was in the short-term study (Cpk = 0.33).
Note that the defect percentages indicate only defects exceeding the
specification limit to which the process mean is nearest. Defects beyond the
far specification limit are not included in the percentages.
The formula used here to calculate the DPMO is thus
         D P M O = 1 , 000 , 000 &#x22C5; ( 1 &#x2212; &#x03D5; ( l e v e l
      &#x2212; 1.5 ) )   {\displaystyle DPMO=1,000,000\centerdot (1-\phi

***** Software[edit] *****
Main article: List_of_Six_Sigma_software_packages
***** Application[edit] *****
Main article: List_of_Six_Sigma_companies
Six Sigma mostly finds application in large organizations.[22] An important
factor in the spread of Six Sigma was GE's 1998 announcement of $350 million in
savings thanks to Six Sigma, a figure that later grew to more than $1 billion.
[22] According to industry consultants like Thomas_Pyzdek and John Kullmann,
companies with fewer than 500 employees are less suited to Six Sigma
implementation or need to adapt the standard approach to make it work for them.
[22] Six Sigma however contains a large number of tools and techniques that
work well in small to mid-size organizations. The fact that an organization is
not big enough to be able to afford black belts does not diminish its abilities
to make improvements using this set of tools and techniques. The infrastructure
described as necessary to support Six Sigma is a result of the size of the
organization rather than a requirement of Six Sigma itself.[22]
Although the scope of Six Sigma differs depending on where it is implemented,
it can successfully deliver its benefits to different applications.
**** Manufacturing[edit] ****
After its first application at Motorola in the late 1980s, other
internationally recognized firms currently recorded high number of savings
after applying Six Sigma. Examples of these are Johnson and Johnson, with $600
million of reported savings, Texas Instruments, which saved over $500 million
as well as TelefÃ³nica de Espana, which reported â¬30 million in savings in
the first 10 months. On top of this, other organizations like Sony and Boeing
achieved large percentages in waste reduction.[23]
**** Engineering and construction[edit] ****
Although companies have considered common quality control and process
improvement strategies, thereâs still a need for more reasonable and
effective methods as all the desired standards and client satisfaction have not
always been reached. There is still a need for an essential analysis that can
control the factors affecting concrete cracks and slippage between concrete and
steel. After conducting a case study on Tinjin Xianyi Construction Technology
Co, Ltd., it was found that construction time and construction waste were
reduced by 26.2% and 67% accordingly after adopting Six Sigma. Similarly, Six
Sigma implementation was studied at one of the largest engineering and
construction companies in the world: Bechtel Corporation, where after an
initial investment of $30 million in a Six Sigma program that included
identifying and preventing rework and defects, over $200 million were saved.
[23]
**** Finance[edit] ****
Six Sigma has played an important role by improving accuracy of allocation of
cash to reduce bank charges, automatic payments, improving accuracy of
reporting, reducing documentary credits defects, reducing check collection
defects, and reducing variation in collector performance. Two of the financial
institutions that have reported considerable improvements in their operations
are Bank of America and American Express. By 2004 Bank of America increased
customer satisfaction by 10.4% and decreased customer issues by 24% by applying
Six Sigma tools in their streamline operations. Similarly, American Express
successfully eliminated non-received renewal credit cards and improved their
overall processes by applying Six Sigma principles. This strategy is also
currently being applied by other financial institutions like GE Capital Corp.,
JP Morgan Chase, and SunTrust Bank, with customer satisfaction being their main
objective.[23]
**** Supply chain[edit] ****
In this field, it is important to ensure that products are delivered to clients
at the right time while preserving high-quality standards from the beginning to
the end of the supply chain. By changing the schematic diagram for the supply
chain, Six Sigma can ensure quality control on products (defect free) and
guarantee delivery deadlines, which are the two major issues involved in the
supply chain.[24]
**** Healthcare[edit] ****
This is a sector that has been highly matched with this doctrine for many years
because of the nature of zero tolerance for mistakes and potential for reducing
medical errors involved in healthcare.[25][26] The goal of Six Sigma in
healthcare is broad and includes reducing the inventory of equipment that
brings extra costs, altering the process of healthcare delivery in order to
make more efficient and refining reimbursements. A study at the University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, which recorded an increase in examinations
with no additional machines of 45% and reduction in patients' preparation time
of 40 minutes; from 45 minutes to 5 minutes in multiple cases.[23]
***** Criticism[edit] *****
**** Lack of originality[edit] ****
Quality expert Joseph_M._Juran described Six Sigma as "a basic version of
quality improvement", stating that "there is nothing new there. It includes
what we used to call facilitators. They've adopted more flamboyant terms, like
belts with different colors. I think that concept has merit to set apart, to
create specialists who can be very helpful. Again, that's not a new idea. The
American_Society_for_Quality long ago established certificates, such as for
reliability engineers."[27]
**** Inadequate for complex manufacturing[edit] ****
Quality expert Philip_B._Crosby pointed out that the Six Sigma standard does
not go far enough[28]âcustomers deserve defect-free_products_every_time. For
example, under the Six Sigma standard, semiconductors which require the
flawless etching of millions of tiny circuits onto a single chip are all
defective.[29]
**** Role of consultants[edit] ****
The use of "Black Belts" as itinerant change agents has fostered an industry of
training and certification. Critics have argued there is overselling of Six
Sigma by too great a number of consulting firms, many of which claim expertise
in Six Sigma when they have only a rudimentary understanding of the tools and
techniques involved or the markets or industries in which they are acting.[30]
**** Potential negative effects[edit] ****
A Fortune article stated that "of 58 large companies that have announced Six
Sigma programs, 91 percent have trailed the S&P_500 since". The statement was
attributed to "an analysis by Charles Holland of consulting firm Qualpro (which
espouses a competing quality-improvement process)".[31] The summary of the
article is that Six Sigma is effective at what it is intended to do, but that
it is "narrowly designed to fix an existing process" and does not help in
"coming up with new products or disruptive technologies."[32][33]
*** Over-reliance on statistical tools[edit] ***
A more direct criticism is the "rigid" nature of Six Sigma with its over-
reliance on methods and tools. In most cases, more attention is paid to
reducing variation and searching for any significant factors and less attention
is paid to developing robustness in the first place (which can altogether
eliminate the need for reducing variation).[34] The extensive reliance on
significance testing and use of multiple regression techniques increases the
risk of making commonly unknown types of statistical errors or mistakes. A
possible consequence of Six Sigma's array of P-value misconceptions is the
false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be
calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external
evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.[35] One of the most
serious but all-too-common misuses of inferential statistics is to take a model
that was developed through exploratory model building and subject it to the
same sorts of statistical tests that are used to validate a model that was
specified in advance.[36]
Another comment refers to the often mentioned Transfer Function, which seems to
be a flawed theory if looked at in detail.[37] Since significance tests were
first popularized many objections have been voiced by prominent and respected
statisticians. The volume of criticism and rebuttal has filled books with
language seldom used in the scholarly debate of a dry subject.[38][39][40][41]
Much of the first criticism was already published more than 40 years ago (see
Statistical_hypothesis_testing_Â§ Criticism).
Articles featuring critics have appeared in the NovemberâDecember 2006 issue
of USA Army Logistician regarding Six-Sigma: "The dangers of a single
paradigmatic orientation (in this case, that of technical rationality) can
blind us to values associated with double-loop_learning and the learning
organization, organization_adaptability, workforce creativity and development,
humanizing the workplace, cultural_awareness, and strategy making."[42]
Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb considers risk managers little more than "blind users" of
statistical tools and methods.[43] He states that statistics is fundamentally
incomplete as a field as it cannot predict the risk of rare eventsâsomething
Six Sigma is specially concerned with. Furthermore, errors in prediction are
likely to occur as a result of ignorance for or distinction between epistemic
and other uncertainties. These errors are the biggest in time variant
(reliability) related failures.[44]
*** Stifling creativity in research environments[edit] ***
According to an article by John Dodge, editor in chief of Design News, use of
Six Sigma is inappropriate in a research environment. Dodge states[45]
"excessive metrics, steps, measurements and Six Sigma's intense focus on
reducing variability water down the discovery process. Under Six Sigma, the
free-wheeling nature of brainstorming and the serendipitous side of discovery
is stifled." He concludes "there's general agreement that freedom in basic or
pure research is preferable while Six Sigma works best in incremental
innovation when there's an expressed commercial goal."
A BusinessWeek article says that James_McNerney's introduction of Six Sigma at
3M had the effect of stifling creativity and reports its removal from the
research function. It cites two Wharton_School professors who say that Six
Sigma leads to incremental innovation at the expense of blue_skies_research.
[46] This phenomenon is further explored in the book Going Lean, which
describes a related approach known as lean_dynamics and provides data to show
that Ford's "6 Sigma" program did little to change its fortunes.[47]
**** Lack of systematic documentation[edit] ****
One criticism voiced by Yasar Jarrar and Andy Neely from the Cranfield_School
of_Management's Centre for Business Performance is that while Six Sigma is a
powerful approach, it can also unduly dominate an organization's culture; and
they add that much of the Six Sigma literature â in a remarkable way (six-
sigma claims to be evidence, scientifically based) â lacks academic rigor:
     One final criticism, probably more to the Six Sigma literature than
     concepts, relates to the evidence for Six Sigmaâs success. So far,
     documented case studies using the Six Sigma methods are presented as
     the strongest evidence for its success. However, looking at these
     documented cases, and apart from a few that are detailed from the
     experience of leading organizations like GE and Motorola, most cases
     are not documented in a systemic or academic manner. In fact, the
     majority are case studies illustrated on websites, and are, at best,
     sketchy. They provide no mention of any specific Six Sigma methods
     that were used to resolve the problems. It has been argued that by
     relying on the Six Sigma criteria, management is lulled into the idea
     that something is being done about quality, whereas any resulting
     improvement is accidental (Latzko 1995). Thus, when looking at the
     evidence put forward for Six Sigma success, mostly by consultants and
     people with vested interests, the question that begs to be asked is:
     are we making a true improvement with Six Sigma methods or just
     getting skilled at telling stories? Everyone seems to believe that we
     are making true improvements, but there is some way to go to document
     these empirically and clarify the causal relations.
     â [34]
**** 1.5 sigma shift[edit] ****
The statistician Donald_J._Wheeler has dismissed the 1.5 sigma shift as "goofy"
because of its arbitrary nature.[48] Its universal applicability is seen as
doubtful.
The 1.5 sigma shift has also become contentious because it results in stated
"sigma levels" that reflect short-term rather than long-term performance: a
process that has long-term defect levels corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance
is, by Six Sigma convention, described as a "six sigma process."[3][49] The
accepted Six Sigma scoring system thus cannot be equated to actual normal
distribution probabilities for the stated number of standard deviations, and
this has been a key bone of contention over how Six Sigma measures are defined.
[49] The fact that it is rarely explained that a "6 sigma" process will have
long-term defect rates corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance rather than
actual 6 sigma performance has led several commentators to express the opinion
that Six Sigma is a confidence_trick.[3]
