Quality management ensures that an organization, product or service is
consistent. It has four main components: quality planning, quality_assurance,
quality_control and quality_improvement.[1] Quality management is focused not
only on product and service_quality, but also on the means to achieve it.
Quality management, therefore, uses quality assurance and control of processes
as well as products to achieve more consistent quality. What a customer wants
and is willing to pay for it determines quality. It is written or unwritten
commitment to a known or unknown consumer in the market . Thus, quality can be
defined as fitness for intended use or, in other words, how well the product
performs its intended function

***** Evolution[edit] *****
Quality management is a recent phenomenon but important for an organization.
Civilizations that supported the arts and crafts allowed clients to choose
goods meeting higher quality standards rather than normal goods. In societies
where arts and crafts are the responsibility of master craftsmen or artists,
these masters would lead their studios and train and supervise others. The
importance of craftsmen diminished as mass production and repetitive work
practices were instituted. The aim was to produce large numbers of the same
goods. The first proponent in the US for this approach was Eli_Whitney who
proposed (interchangeable) parts manufacture for muskets, hence producing the
identical components and creating a musket assembly line. The next step forward
was promoted by several people including Frederick_Winslow_Taylor, a mechanical
engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. He is sometimes called
"the father of scientific management." He was one of the intellectual leaders
of the Efficiency Movement and part of his approach laid a further foundation
for quality management, including aspects like standardization and adopting
improved practices. Henry_Ford was also important in bringing process and
quality management practices into operation in his assembly lines. In Germany,
Karl_Benz, often called the inventor of the motor car, was pursuing similar
assembly and production practices, although real mass production was properly
initiated in Volkswagen after World War II. From this period onwards, North
American companies focused predominantly upon production against lower cost
with increased efficiency.
Walter_A._Shewhart made a major step in the evolution towards quality
management by creating a method for quality control for production, using
statistical methods, first proposed in 1924. This became the foundation for his
ongoing work on statistical quality control. W._Edwards_Deming later applied
statistical process control methods in the United States during World War II,
thereby successfully improving quality in the manufacture of munitions and
other strategically important products.
Quality leadership from a national perspective has changed over the past
decades. After the second world war, Japan decided to make quality improvement
a national imperative as part of rebuilding their economy, and sought the help
of Shewhart, Deming and Juran, amongst others. W._Edwards_Deming championed
Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. He is probably best known for his
management philosophy establishing quality, productivity, and competitive
position. He has formulated 14_points of attention for managers, which are a
high level abstraction of many of his deep insights. They should be interpreted
by learning and understanding the deeper insights. These 14_points include key
concepts such as:
    * Break down barriers between departments
    * Management should learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership
    * Supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a
      better job
    * Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service
    * Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement
In the 1950s and 1960s, Japanese goods were synonymous with cheapness and low
quality, but over time their quality initiatives began to be successful, with
Japan achieving high levels of quality in products from the 1970s onward. For
example, Japanese cars regularly top the J.D._Power customer satisfaction
ratings. In the 1980s Deming was asked by Ford Motor Company to start a quality
initiative after they realized that they were falling behind Japanese
manufacturers. A number of highly successful quality initiatives have been
invented by the Japanese (see for example on this pages: Genichi_Taguchi, QFD,
Toyota_Production_System). Many of the methods not only provide techniques but
also have associated quality culture (i.e. people factors). These methods are
now adopted by the same western countries that decades earlier derided Japanese
methods.
Customers recognize that quality is an important attribute in products and
services. Suppliers recognize that quality can be an important differentiator
between their own offerings and those of competitors (quality differentiation
is also called the quality gap). In the past two decades this quality gap has
been greatly reduced between competitive products and services. This is partly
due to the contracting (also called outsourcing) of manufacture to countries
like China and India, as well internationalization of trade and competition.
These countries, among many others, have raised their own standards of quality
in order to meet international standards and customer demands.[2][3] The ISO
9000 series of standards are probably the best known International standards
for quality management.
Customer_satisfaction is the backbone of Quality Management. Setting up a
million dollar company without taking care of needs of customer will ultimately
decrease its revenue.
There is a huge number of books available on quality management. Some themes
have become more significant including quality_culture, the importance of
knowledge_management, and the role of leadership in promoting and achieving
high quality. Disciplines like systems thinking are bringing more holistic
approaches to quality so that people, process and products are considered
together rather than independent factors in quality management.
The influence of quality thinking has spread to non-traditional applications
outside of walls of manufacturing, extending into service sectors and into
areas such as sales, marketing and customer_service.[4]
***** Principles[edit] *****
The International Standard for Quality management (ISO 9001:2015) adopts a
number of management principles, that can be used by top management to guide
their organizations towards improved performance, Now the concept of TQM
( total quality management) is widely known and understood and many
organizations like JCI, CBAHI,Canadian board .... put integrated numbers of
standards to cover all areas in healthcare to achieve the TQM principles.
**** Customer focus[edit] ****
The primary focus of quality management is to meet customer_requirements and to
strive to exceed customer expectations.
Rationale
Sustained success is achieved when an organization attracts and retains the
confidence of customers and other interested parties on whom it depends. Every
aspect of customer interaction provides an opportunity to create more value for
the customer. Understanding current and future needs of customers and other
interested parties contributes to sustained success of an organization [5]
**** Leadership[edit] ****
Leaders at all levels establish unity of purpose and direction and create
conditions in which people are engaged in achieving the organizationâs
quality objectives. Leadership has to take up the necessary changes required
for quality improvement and encourage a sense of quality throughout
organisation. Rationale
Creation of unity of purpose and direction and engagement of people enable an
organization to align its strategies, policies, processes and resources to
achieve its objectives [6]
**** Engagement of people[edit] ****
Competent, empowered and engaged people at all levels throughout the
organization are essential to enhance its capability to create and deliver
value.
Rationale
To manage an organization effectively and efficiently, it is important to
involve all people at all levels and to respect them as individuals.
Recognition, empowerment and enhancement of competence facilitate the
engagement of people in achieving the organizationâs quality objectives.[7]
**** Process approach[edit] ****
Consistent and predictable results are achieved more effectively and
efficiently when activities are understood and managed as interrelated
processes that function as a coherent system.
Rationale
The quality management system consists of interrelated processes. Understanding
how results are produced by this system enables an organization to optimize the
system and its performance.[8]
**** Improvement[edit] ****
Successful organizations have an ongoing focus on improvement.
'Rationale'
Improvement is essential for an organization to maintain current levels of
performance, to react to changes in its internal and external conditions and to
create new opportunities.[9]
**** Evidence based decision making[edit] ****
Further information: decision_making
Decisions based on the analysis and evaluation of data and information are more
likely to produce desired results.
Rationale
Decision making can be a complex process, and it always involves some
uncertainty. It often involves multiple types and sources of inputs, as well as
their interpretation, which can be subjective. It is important to understand
cause-and-effect relationships and potential unintended_consequences. Facts,
evidence and data_analysis lead to greater objectivity and confidence in
decision making.[10]
**** Relationship management[edit] ****
Further information: Relationship_management
For sustained success, an organization manages its relationships with
interested parties, such as suppliers, retailers.
'Rationale'
Interested parties influence the performance of an organizations and industry.
Sustained success is more likely to be achieved when the organization manages
relationships with all of its interested parties to optimize their impact on
its performance. Relationship management with its supplier and partner networks
is of particular importance.[11]
**** Criticism[edit] ****
The social scientist Bettina_Warzecha (2017)[12] describes the central concepts
of Quality Management (QM), such as e.g. process orientation, controllability,
and zero defects as modern myths. She demonstrates that zero-error processes
and the associated illusion of controllability involve the epistemological
problem of self-referentiality. The emphasis on the processes in QM also
ignores the artificiality and thus arbitrariness of the difference between
structure and process. Above all, the complexity of management cannot be
reduced to standardized (mathematical) procedures. According to her, the risks
and negative side effects of QM are usually greater than the benefits (see also
brand eins, 2010).[13]
***** Quality improvement and more[edit] *****
The PDCA cycle[14]
There are many methods for quality improvement. These cover product
improvement, process improvement and people based improvement. In the following
list are methods of quality management and techniques that incorporate and
drive quality improvement:
   1. ISO_9004:2008 â guidelines for performance improvement.
   2. ISO_9001:2015 - a certified quality management system (QMS) for
      organisations who want to prove their ability to consistently provide
      products and services that meet the needs of their customers and other
      relevant stakeholders.[15]
   3. ISO_15504-4: 2005 â information technology â process assessment â
      Part 4: Guidance on use for process improvement and process capability
      determination.
   4. QFD â quality function deployment, also known as the house of quality
      approach.
   5. Kaizen â æ¹å, Japanese for change for the better; the common English
      term is continuous improvement.
   6. Zero Defect Program â created by NEC Corporation of Japan, based upon
      statistical_process_control and one of the inputs for the inventors of
      Six Sigma.
   7. Six_Sigma â 6Ï, Six Sigma combines established methods such as
      statistical process control, design_of_experiments and failure_mode_and
      effects_analysis_(FMEA) in an overall framework.
   8. PDCA â plan, do, check, act cycle for quality control purposes. (Six
      Sigma's DMAIC method (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) may be
      viewed as a particular implementation of this.)
   9. Quality_circle â a group (people oriented) approach to improvement.
  10. Taguchi_methods â statistical oriented methods including quality
      robustness, quality loss function, and target specifications.
  11. The_Toyota_Production_System â reworked in the west into lean
      manufacturing.
  12. Kansei_Engineering â an approach that focuses on capturing customer
      emotional feedback about products to drive improvement.
  13. TQM â total_quality_management is a management strategy aimed at
      embedding awareness of quality in all organizational processes. First
      promoted in Japan with the Deming prize which was adopted and adapted in
      USA as the Malcolm_Baldrige_National_Quality_Award and in Europe as the
      European_Foundation_for_Quality_Management award (each with their own
      variations).
  14. TRIZ â meaning "theory of inventive problem solving"
  15. BPR â business_process_reengineering, a management approach aiming at
      optimizing the workflows and processes within an organisation.
  16. OQRM â Object-oriented Quality and Risk Management, a model for quality
      and risk management.[16]
  17. Top_Down_&_Bottom_Up_ApproachesâLeadership approaches to change[17]
Proponents of each approach have sought to improve them as well as apply them
for small, medium and large gains. Simple one is Process Approach, which forms
the basis of ISO_9001:2008 Quality Management System standard, duly driven from
the 'Eight principles of Quality management', process approach being one of
them. Thareja[18] writes about the mechanism and benefits: "The process
(proficiency) may be limited in words, but not in its applicability. While it
fulfills the criteria of all-round gains: in terms of the competencies
augmented by the participants; the organisation seeks newer directions to the
business success, the individual brand image of both the people and the
organisation, in turn, goes up. The competencies which were hitherto rated as
being smaller, are better recognized and now acclaimed to be more potent and
fruitful".[19] The more complex Quality improvement tools are tailored for
enterprise types not originally targeted. For example, Six Sigma was designed
for manufacturing but has spread to service enterprises. Each of these
approaches and methods has met with success but also with failures.
Some of the common differentiators between success and failure include
commitment, knowledge and expertise to guide improvement, scope of change/
improvement desired (Big Bang type changes tend to fail more often compared to
smaller changes) and adaption to enterprise cultures. For example, quality
circles do not work well in every enterprise (and are even discouraged by some
managers), and relatively few TQM-participating enterprises have won the
national quality awards.
There have been well publicized failures of BPR, as well as Six Sigma.
Enterprises therefore need to consider carefully which quality improvement
methods to adopt, and certainly should not adopt all those listed here.
It is important not to underestimate the people factors, such as culture, in
selecting a quality improvement approach. Any improvement (change) takes time
to implement, gain acceptance and stabilize as accepted practice. Improvement
must allow pauses between implementing new changes so that the change is
stabilized and assessed as a real improvement, before the next improvement is
made (hence continual improvement, not continuous improvement).
Improvements that change the culture take longer as they have to overcome
greater resistance to change. It is easier and often more effective to work
within the existing cultural boundaries and make small improvements (that is
'Kaizen') than to make major transformational changes. Use of Kaizen in Japan
was a major reason for the creation of Japanese industrial and economic
strength.
On the other hand, transformational change works best when an enterprise faces
a crisis and needs to make major changes in order to survive. In Japan, the
land of Kaizen, Carlos_Ghosn led a transformational change at Nissan Motor
Company which was in a financial and operational crisis. Well organized quality
improvement programs take all these factors into account when selecting the
quality improvement methods.
***** Quality standards[edit] *****
**** ISO standards[edit] ****
The International_Organization_for_Standardization (ISO) created the Quality
Management_System (QMS)[20] standards in 1987. They were the ISO 9000:1987
series of standards comprising ISO 9001:1987, ISO 9002:1987 and ISO 9003:1987;
which were applicable in different types of industries, based on the type of
activity or process: designing, production or service delivery.
The standards are reviewed every few years by the International Organization
for Standardization. The version in 1994 was called the ISO 9000:1994 series;
consisting of the ISO 9001:1994, 9002:1994 and 9003:1994 versions.
The last major revision was in the year 2000 and the series was called ISO
9000:2000 series. The ISO 9002 and 9003 standards were integrated into one
single certifiable standard: ISO 9001:2000. After December 2003, organizations
holding ISO 9002 or 9003 standards had to complete a transition to the new
standard.
ISO released a minor revision, ISO 9001:2008 on 14 October 2008. It contains no
new requirements. Many of the changes were to improve consistency in grammar,
facilitating translation of the standard into other languages for use by over
950,000 certified organization in the 175 countries (as at Dec 2007) that use
the standard.
The ISO_9004:2009 document gives guidelines for performance improvement over
and above the basic standard (ISO 9001:2000). This standard provides a
measurement framework for improved quality management, similar to and based
upon the measurement framework for process assessment.
The Quality Management System standards created by ISO are meant to certify the
processes and the system of an organization, not the product or service itself.
ISO 9000 standards do not certify the quality of the product or service.
In 2005 the International Organization for Standardization released a standard,
ISO_22000, meant for the food industry. This standard covers the values and
principles of ISO 9000 and the HACCP standards. It gives one single integrated
standard for the food industry and is expected to become more popular in the
coming years in such industry.
ISO has also released standards for other industries. For example, Technical
Standard TS 16949 defines requirements in addition to those in ISO 9001:2008
specifically for the automotive industry.
ISO has a number of standards that support quality management. One group
describes processes (including ISO/IEC_12207 and ISO/IEC_15288) and another
describes process assessment and improvement ISO 15504.
**** CMMI and IDEAL methods[edit] ****
The Software Engineering Institute has its own process assessment and
improvement methods, called CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) and
IDEAL respectively.
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process improvement training
and appraisal program and service administered and marketed by Carnegie Mellon
University and required by many DOD and U.S. Government contracts, especially
in software development. Carnegie Mellon University claims CMMI can be used to
guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire
organization. Under the CMMI methodology, processes are rated according to
their maturity levels, which are defined as: Initial, Managed, Defined,
Quantitatively Managed, Optimizing. Currently supported is CMMI Version 1.3.
CMMI is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by Carnegie Mellon
University.
Three constellations of CMMI are:
    * Product and service development (CMMI for Development)
    * Service establishment, management, and delivery (CMMI for Services)
    * Product and service acquisition (CMMI for Acquisition).
CMMI Version 1.3 was released on November 1, 2010. This release is noteworthy
because it updates all three CMMI models (CMMI for Development, CMMI for
Services, and CMMI for Acquisition) to make them consistent and to improve
their high maturity practices. The CMMI Product Team has reviewed more than
1,150 change requests for the models and 850 for the appraisal method.
As part of its mission to transition mature technology to the software
community, the SEI has transferred CMMI-related products and activities to the
CMMI Institute, a 100%-controlled subsidiary of Carnegie Innovations, Carnegie
Mellon Universityâs technology commercialization enterprise.[21]

**** Certification[edit] ****
Since 1995, the American_Society_for_Quality has offered a Certified Manager of
Quality/ Organizational Excellence (CMQ/OE). This was known until 2005 as the
Certified Quality Manager (CQM).ASQ
***** Quality management software[edit] *****
Quality Management Software is a category of technologies used by organizations
to manage the delivery of high quality products. Solutions range in
functionality, however, with the use of automation capabilities they typically
have components for managing internal and external risk, compliance, and the
quality of processes and products. Pre-configured and industry-specific
solutions are available and generally require integration with existing IT
architecture applications such as ERP, SCM, CRM, and PLM.
Quality Management Software Functionalities
    * Non-Conformances/Corrective_and_Preventive_Action
    * Compliance/Audit_Management
    * Supplier Quality Management
    * Risk_Management
    * Statistical_Process_Control
    * Failure_Mode_and_Effects_Analysis
    * Complaint Handling
    * Advanced_Product_Quality_Planning
    * Environment,_Health,_and_Safety
    * Hazard_Analysis_&_Critical_Control_Points
    * Production_Part_Approval_Process
Enterprise Quality Management Software
The intersection of technology and quality management software prompted the
emergence of a new software category: Enterprise Quality Management Software
(EQMS). EQMS is a platform for cross-functional communication and collaboration
that centralizes, standardizes, and streamlines quality management data from
across the value chain. The software breaks down functional silos created by
traditionally implemented standalone and targeted solutions. Supporting the
proliferation and accessibility of information across supply chain activities,
design, production, distribution, and service, it provides a holistic viewpoint
for managing the quality of products and processes.[22]
***** Quality terms[edit] *****
    * Quality Improvement can be distinguished from Quality Control in that
      Quality Improvement is the purposeful change of a process to improve the
      reliability of achieving an outcome.
