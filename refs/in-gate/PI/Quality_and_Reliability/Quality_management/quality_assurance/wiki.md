****** Quality assurance ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Quality assurance (QA) is a way of preventing mistakes and defects in
manufactured products and avoiding problems when delivering products or
services to customers; which ISO_9000 defines as "part of quality_management
focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled".
[1] This defect prevention in quality assurance differs subtly from defect
detection and rejection in quality_control and has been referred to as a shift
left since it focuses on quality earlier in the process (i.e., to the left of a
linear process diagram reading left to right).[2]
The terms "quality assurance" and "quality control" are often used
interchangeably to refer to ways of ensuring the quality of a service or
product.[3] For instance, the term "assurance" is often used as follows:
Implementation of inspection and structured testing as a measure of quality
assurance in a television set software project at Philips Semiconductors is
described.[4] The term "control", however, is used to describe the fifth phase
of the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC) model. DMAIC is a
data-driven quality strategy used to improve processes.[5]
Quality assurance comprises administrative and procedural activities
implemented in a quality_system so that requirements and goals for a product,
service or activity will be fulfilled.[3] It is the systematic measurement,
comparison with a standard, monitoring of processes and an associated feedback
loop that confers error prevention.[6] This can be contrasted with quality
control, which is focused on process output.
Quality assurance includes two principles: "Fit for purpose" (the product
should be suitable for the intended purpose); and "right first time" (mistakes
should be eliminated). QA includes management of the quality of raw materials,
assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and
management, production and inspection processes.[7] The two principles also
manifest before the background of developing (engineering) a novel technical
product: The task of engineering is to make it work once, while the task of
quality assurance is to make it work all the time.[8]
Historically, defining what suitable product or service quality means has been
a more difficult process, determined in many ways, from the subjective user-
based approach that contains "the different weights that individuals normally
attach to quality characteristics," to the value-based approach which finds
consumers linking quality to price and making overall conclusions of quality
based on such a relationship.[9]

***** History[edit] *****
**** Initial efforts to control the quality of production[edit] ****
During the Middle_Ages, guilds adopted responsibility for the quality of goods
and services offered by their members, setting and maintaining certain
standards for guild membership.[10]
Royal governments purchasing material were interested in quality_control as
customers. For this reason, King John_of_England appointed William de Wrotham
to report about the construction and repair of ships.[11] Centuries later,
Samuel_Pepys, Secretary to the British Admiralty, appointed multiple such
overseers to standardize sea rations and naval training.[12]
Prior to the extensive division_of_labor and mechanization resulting from the
Industrial_Revolution, it was possible for workers to control the quality of
their own products. The Industrial Revolution led to a system in which large
groups of people performing a specialized type of work were grouped together
under the supervision of a foreman who was appointed to control the quality of
work manufactured.
**** Wartime production[edit] ****
During the time of the First_World_War, manufacturing processes typically
became more complex, with larger numbers of workers being supervised. This
period saw the widespread introduction of mass_production and piece_work, which
created problems as workmen could now earn more money by the production of
extra products, which in turn occasionally led to poor quality workmanship
being passed on to the assembly_lines. Pioneers such as Frederick_Winslow
Taylor and Henry_Ford recognized the limitations of the methods being used in
mass production at the time and the subsequent varying quality of output.
Taylor, utilizing the concept of scientific management, helped separate
production tasks into many simple steps (the assembly line) and limited quality
control to a few specific individuals, limiting complexity.[13] Ford emphasized
standardization of design and component standards to ensure a standard product
was produced, while quality was the responsibility of machine inspectors,
"placed in each department to cover all operations ... at frequent intervals,
so that no faulty operation shall proceed for any great length of time."[14]
Out of this also came statistical_process_control (SPC), which was pioneered by
Walter_A._Shewhart at Bell Laboratories in the early 1920s. Shewhart developed
the control chart in 1924 and the concept of a state of statistical control.
Statistical control is equivalent to the concept of exchangeability[15][16]
developed by logician William_Ernest_Johnson, also in 1924, in his book Logic,
Part III: The Logical Foundations of Science.[17] Along with a team at AT&T
that included Harold Dodge and Harry Romig, he worked to put sampling
inspection on a rational statistical basis as well. Shewhart consulted with
Colonel Leslie E. Simon in the application of control charts to munitions
manufacture at the Army's Picatinny_Arsenal in 1934.[18] That successful
application helped convince Army Ordnance to engage AT&T's George Edwards to
consult on the use of statistical quality control among its divisions and
contractors at the outbreak of World War II.[19]
**** Postwar[edit] ****
After World War II, many countries' manufacturing capabilities that had been
destroyed during the war were rebuilt. General_Douglas_MacArthur oversaw the
rebuilding of Japan. He involved two key people in the development of modern
quality concepts: W._Edwards_Deming and Joseph_Juran. They and others promoted
the collaborative concepts of quality to Japanese business and technical
groups, and these groups used these concepts in the redevelopment of the
Japanese economy.[20]
Although there were many people trying to lead United States industries toward
a more comprehensive approach to quality, the US continued to apply the Quality
Control (QC) concepts of inspection and sampling to remove defective products
from production lines, essentially unaware of or ignoring advances in QA for
decades.[21]
***** Approaches[edit] *****
**** Failure testing[edit] ****
It is valuable to failure test or stress_test a complete consumer product. In
mechanical terms this is the operation of a product until it fails, often under
stresses such as increasing vibration, temperature, and humidity. This may
expose many unanticipated weaknesses in the product, and the data is used to
drive engineering and manufacturing process improvements. Often quite simple
changes can dramatically improve product service, such as changing to mold-
resistant paint or adding lock-washer placement to the training for new
assembly personnel.
**** Statistical control[edit] ****
Statistical control is based on analyses of objective and subjective data.[22]
Many organizations use statistical_process_control as a tool in any quality
improvement effort[23] to track quality data. Any product can be statistically
charted as long as they have a common cause variance or special cause variance
to track.[24]
Walter Shewart of Bell Telephone Laboratories recognized that when a product is
made, data can be taken from scrutinized areas of a sample lot of the part and
statistical variances are then analyzed and charted. Control can then be
implemented on the part in the form of rework or scrap, or control can be
implemented on the process that made the part, ideally eliminating the defect
before more parts can be made like it.[22]
**** Total quality management[edit] ****
Main article: Total_quality_management
The quality of products is dependent upon that of the participating
constituents,[25] some of which are sustainable and effectively controlled
while others are not. The process(es) which are managed with QA pertain to
Total_quality_management.
If the specification does not reflect the true quality requirements, the
product's quality cannot be guaranteed. For instance, the parameters for a
pressure vessel should cover not only the material and dimensions but
operating, environmental, safety, reliability and maintainability requirements.
**** Models and standards[edit] ****
ISO_17025 is an international_standard that specifies the general requirements
for the competence to carry out tests and or calibrations. There are 15
management requirements and 10 technical requirements. These requirements
outline what a laboratory must do to become accredited. Management system
refers to the organization's structure for managing its processes or activities
that transform inputs of resources into a product or service which meets the
organization's objectives, such as satisfying the customer's quality
requirements, complying with regulations, or meeting environmental objectives.
WHO has developed several tools and offers training courses for quality
assurance in public health laboratories.[26]
The Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration (CMMI) model is widely used to
implement Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA) in an organization. The
CMMI maturity levels can be divided into 5 steps, which a company can achieve
by performing specific activities within the organization.
**** Company quality[edit] ****
During the 1980s, the concept of "company quality" with the focus on management
and people came to the fore in the U.S.[21] It was considered that, if all
departments approached quality with an open mind, success was possible if
management led the quality improvement process.
The company-wide quality approach places an emphasis on four aspects (enshrined
in standards such as ISO 9001):[27]
   1. Elements such as controls, job management, adequate processes,
      performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records
   2. Competence such as knowledge, skills, experiences, qualifications
   3. Soft elements, such as personnel integrity, confidence, organizational
      culture, motivation, team_spirit and quality relationships
   4. Infrastructure (as it enhances or limits functionality)
The quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these aspects is deficient.
QA is not limited to manufacturing, and can be applied to any business or non-
business activity, including: design, consulting, banking, insurance, computer
software development, retailing, investment, transportation, education, and
translation.
It comprises a quality improvement process, which is generic in the sense that
it can be applied to any of these activities and it establishes a behavior
pattern, which supports the achievement of quality.
This in turn is supported by quality management practices which can include a
number of business_systems and which are usually specific to the activities of
the business_unit concerned.
In manufacturing and construction activities, these business practices can be
equated to the models for quality assurance defined by the International
Standards contained in the ISO_9000 series and the specified Specifications for
quality systems.
In the system of Company Quality, the work being carried out was shop floor
inspection which did not reveal the major quality problems. This led to quality
assurance or total quality control, which has come into being recently.
***** In practice[edit] *****
**** Medical industry[edit] ****
QA is very important in the medical field because it helps to identify the
standards of medical equipments and services. Hospitals and laboratories make
use of external agencies in order to ensure standards for equipment such as X-
ray machines, Diagnostic Radiology and AERB. QA is particularly applicable
throughout the development and introduction of new medicines and medical
devices. The Research Quality Association (RQA) supports and promotes the
quality of research in life sciences, through its members and regulatory
bodies.
**** Aerospace industry[edit] ****
The term product assurance (PA) is often used instead of quality assurance and
is, alongside project management and engineering, one of the three primary
project functions. Quality assurance is seen as one part of product assurance.
Due to the sometimes catastrophic consequences a single failure can have for
human lives, the environment, a device, or a mission, product assurance plays a
particularly important role here. It has organizational, budgetary and product
developmental independence meaning that it reports to highest management only,
has its own budget, and does not expend labor to help build a product. Product
assurance stands on an equal footing with project management but embraces the
customer's point of view.[8]
**** Software development[edit] ****
Main article: Software_testing
Software_quality_assurance refers to monitoring the software_engineering
processes and methods used to ensure quality. Various methods are employed for
this, such as ensuring conformance to one or more standards, such as ISO_9000
or a model such as CMMI. In addition, enterprise quality management software is
used to correct issues such as supply chain disaggregation and to ensure
regulatory_compliance; these are vital for medical_device manufacturers.[28]
**** Using contractors or consultants[edit] ****
Consultants and contractors are sometimes employed when introducing new quality
practices and methods, particularly where the relevant skills and expertise and
resources are not available within the organization. Consultants and
contractors will often employ Quality Management Systems (QMS), auditing and
procedural documentation writing CMMI, Six_Sigma, Measurement_Systems_Analysis
(MSA), Quality_Function_Deployment (QFD), Failure_Mode_and_Effects_Analysis
(FMEA), and Advance_Product_Quality_Planning (APQP).
