From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Interchangeable parts are parts (components) that are, for practical purposes,
identical. They are made to specifications that ensure that they are so nearly
identical that they will fit into any assembly of the same type. One such part
can freely replace another, without any custom fitting, such as filing. This
interchangeability allows easy assembly of new devices, and easier repair of
existing devices, while minimizing both the time and skill required of the
person doing the assembly or repair.
The concept of interchangeability was crucial to the introduction of the
assembly_line at the beginning of the 20th century, and has become an important
element of some modern manufacturing but is missing from other important
industries.
Interchangeability of parts was achieved by combining a number of innovations
and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several machine
tools, such as the slide_rest_lathe, screw-cutting_lathe, turret_lathe, milling
machine and metal_planer. Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the
machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and
blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.[1]
Electrification allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric
motors, eliminating line_shaft drives from steam engines or water power and
allowing higher speeds, making modern large scale manufacturing possible.[2]
Modern machine tools often have numerical_control (NC) which evolved into CNC
(computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available.
Methods for industrial production of interchangeable parts in the United States
were first developed in the nineteenth century. The term American_system_of
manufacturing was sometimes applied to them at the time, in distinction from
earlier methods. Within a few decades such methods were in use in various
countries, so American system is now a term of historical reference rather than
current industrial nomenclature.

***** First use[edit] *****
Evidence of the use of interchangeable parts can be traced back over two
thousand years to Carthage in the First_Punic_War. Carthaginian ships had
standardized, interchangeable parts that even came with assembly instructions
akin to "tab a into slot b" marked on them.[3]
In East_Asia during the Warring_States period and later the Qin_Dynasty, bronze
crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be
interchangeable.
***** Origins of the modern concept[edit] *****
In the late 18th century, French General Jean-Baptiste_Vaquette_de_Gribeauval
promoted standardized weapons in what became known as the SystÃ¨me_Gribeauval
after it was issued as a royal order in 1765. (Its focus at the time was
artillery more than muskets or handguns.) One of the accomplishments of the
system was that solid cast cannons were bored to precise tolerances, which
allowed the walls to be thinner than cannons poured with hollow cores. However,
because cores were often off center, the wall thickness determined the size of
the bore. Standardized boring allowed cannons to be shorter without sacrificing
accuracy and range because of the tighter fit of the shells. It also allowed
standardization of the shells.[1]
Before the 18th century, devices such as guns were made one at a time by
gunsmiths in a unique manner. If one single component of a firearm needed a
replacement, the entire firearm either had to be sent to an expert gunsmith for
custom repairs, or discarded and replaced by another firearm. During the 18th
and early 19th centuries, the idea of replacing these methods with a system of
interchangeable manufacture was gradually developed.[4][5] The development took
decades and involved many people.[4][5]
Gribeauval provided patronage to HonorÃ©_Blanc, who attempted to implement the
SystÃ¨me_Gribeauval at the musket level. By around 1778, HonorÃ© Blanc began
producing some of the first firearms with interchangeable flint locks, although
they were carefully made by craftsmen. Blanc demonstrated in front of a
committee of scientists that his muskets could be fitted with flint locks
picked at random from a pile of parts.[1]
Muskets with interchangeable locks caught the attention of Thomas_Jefferson
through the efforts of HonorÃ© Blanc when Jefferson was Ambassador to France in
1785. Jefferson tried to persuade Blanc to move to America, but was not
successful, so he wrote to the American Secretary of War with the idea, and
when he returned to the USA he worked to fund its development. President George
Washington approved of the idea, and by 1798 a contract was issued to Eli
Whitney for 12,000 muskets built under the new system.[6]
Louis_de_Tousard, who fled the French Revolution, joined the U.S. Corp of
Artillerists in 1795 and wrote an influential artillerist's manual that
stressed the importance of standardization.[1]
***** Implementation[edit] *****
Numerous inventors began to try to implement the principle Blanc had described.
The development of the machine tools and manufacturing practices required would
be a great expense to the U.S. Ordnance_Department, and for some years while
trying to achieve interchangeability, the firearms produced cost more to
manufacture. By 1853, there was evidence that interchangeable parts, then
perfected by the Federal Armories, led to savings. The Ordnance Department
freely shared the techniques used with outside suppliers.[1]
**** Eli Whitney and an early attempt[edit] ****
In the US, Eli_Whitney saw the potential benefit of developing "interchangeable
parts" for the firearms of the United States military. In July 1801 he built
ten guns, all containing the same exact parts and mechanisms, then disassembled
them before the United_States_Congress. He placed the parts in a mixed pile
and, with help, reassembled all of the firearms right in front of Congress,
much like Blanc had done some years before.[7]
The Congress was captivated and ordered a standard for all United States
equipment. The use of interchangeable parts removed the problems of earlier
eras concerning the difficulty or impossibility of producing new parts for old
equipment. If one firearm part failed, another could be ordered, and the
firearm would not have to be discarded. The catch was that Whitney's guns were
costly and handmade by skilled workmen.
Charles Fitch credited Whitney with successfully executing a firearms contract
with interchangeable parts using the American_System,[4] but historians Merritt
Roe_Smith and Robert_B._Gordon have since determined that Whitney never
actually achieved interchangeable parts manufacturing. His family's arms
company, however, did so after his death.
**** Brunel's sailing blocks[edit] ****
A pulley block for rigging on a sailing ship
Mass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by Marc
Isambard_Brunel in cooperation with Henry_Maudslay and Simon Goodrich, under
the management of (and with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir Samuel
Bentham, the Inspector General of Naval Works at Portsmouth_Block_Mills,
Portsmouth_Dockyard, Hampshire, England. At the time, the Napoleonic_War was at
its height, and the Royal_Navy was in a state of expansion that required
100,000 pulley_blocks to be manufactured a year. Bentham had already achieved
remarkable efficiency at the docks by introducing power-driven machinery and
reorganising the dockyard system.
Marc Brunel, a pioneering engineer, and Maudslay, a founding father of machine
tool technology who had developed the first industrially practical screw-
cutting_lathe in 1800 which standardized screw_thread sizes for the first time,
[8] collaborated on plans to manufacture block-making machinery; the proposal
was submitted to the Admiralty who agreed to commission his services. By 1805,
the dockyard had been fully updated with the revolutionary, purpose-built
machinery at a time when products were still built individually with different
components. A total of 45 machines were required to perform 22 processes on the
blocks, which could be made in three different sizes. The machines were almost
entirely made of metal thus improving their accuracy and durability. The
machines would make markings and indentations on the blocks to ensure alignment
throughout the process. One of the many advantages of this new method was the
increase in labour productivity due to the less labour-intensive requirements
of managing the machinery. Richard Beamish, assistant to Brunel's son and
engineer, Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel, wrote:
     So that ten men, by the aid of this machinery, can accomplish with
     uniformity, celerity and ease, what formerly required the uncertain
     labour of one hundred and ten.
By 1808, annual production had reached 130,000 blocks and some of the equipment
was still in operation as late as the mid-twentieth century.[9][10][11][12][13]
[14][15][16][17][18]
**** Terry's clocks: success in wood[edit] ****
A wooden gear from one of Terry's tall case clocks, showing the use of milled
teeth.
Eli_Terry was using interchangeable parts using a milling machine as early as
1800. Ward Francillon, a horologist concluded in a study that Terry had already
accomplished interchangeable parts as early as 1800. The study examined several
of Terry's clocks produced between 1800-1807. The parts were labeled and
interchanged as needed. The study concluded that all clock pieces were
interchangeable. The very first mass production using interchangeable parts in
America was Eli_Terry's 1806 Porter Contract, which called for the production
of 4000 clocks in three years.[19] During this contract, Terry crafted four-
thousand wooden gear tall case movements, at a time when the annual average was
about a dozen.[20] Unlike Eli_Whitney, Terry manufactured his products without
government funding. Terry saw the potential of clocks becoming a household
object. With the use of a milling machine, Terry was able to mass-produce clock
wheels and plates a few dozen at the same time. Jigs and templates were used to
make uniform pinions, so that all parts could be assembled using an Assembly
Line.[20]
**** North and Hall: success in metal[edit] ****
The crucial step toward interchangeability in metal parts was taken by Simeon
North, working only a few miles from Eli_Terry. North created one of the
world's first true milling_machines to do metal shaping that had been done by
hand with a file. Diana Muir believes that North's milling machine was online
around 1816.[21] Muir, Merritt Roe Smith, and Robert_B._Gordon all agree that
before 1832 both Simeon North and John_Hall were able to mass-produce complex
machines with moving parts (guns) using a system that entailed the use of
rough-forged parts, with a milling machine that milled the parts to near-
correct size, and that were then "filed to gage by hand with the aid of filing
jigs."[22]
Historians differ over the question of whether Hall or North made the crucial
improvement. Merrit Roe Smith believes that it was done by Hall.[23][24] Muir
demonstrates the close personal ties and professional alliances between Simeon
North and neighboring mechanics mass-producing wooden clocks to argue that the
process for manufacturing guns with interchangeable parts was most probably
devised by North in emulation of the successful methods used in mass-producing
clocks.[21] It may not be possible to resolve the question with absolute
certainty unless documents now unknown should surface in the future.
**** Late 19th and early 20th centuries: dissemination throughout manufacturing
[edit] ****
Skilled engineers and machinists, many with armory experience, spread
interchangeable manufacturing techniques to other American industries including
clockmakers and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and
Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860.[1][25] Late to adopt the
interchangeable system were Singer_Corporation sewing machine (1870s), reaper
manufacturer McCormick_Harvesting_Machine_Company (1870sâ1880s)[1] and
several large steam engine manufacturers such as Corliss (mid-1880s)[26] as
well as locomotive makers. Typewriters followed some years later. Then large
scale production of bicycles in the 1880s began to use the interchangeable
system.[1]
During these decades, true interchangeability grew from a scarce and difficult
achievement into an everyday capability throughout the manufacturing
industries.[27] In the 1950s and 1960s, historians_of_technology broadened the
world's understanding of the history of the development. Few people outside
that academic discipline knew much about the topic until as recently as the
1980s and 1990s, when the academic knowledge began finding wider audiences. As
recently as the 1960s, when Alfred_P._Sloan published his famous memoir and
management treatise, My Years with General Motors, even the longtime president
and chair of the largest manufacturing enterprise that had ever existed knew
very little about the history of the development, other than to say that
     [Henry_M._Leland was], I believe, one of those mainly responsible for
     bringing the technique of interchangeable parts into automobile
     manufacturing. [â¦] It has been called to my attention that Eli
     Whitney, long before, had started the development of interchangeable
     parts in connection with the manufacture of guns, a fact which
     suggests a line of descent from Whitney to Leland to the automobile
     industry.[28]
One of the better-known books on the subject, which was first published in 1984
and has enjoyed a readership beyond academia, has been David_A._Hounshell's
From the American System to Mass Production, 1800â1932: The Development of
Manufacturing Technology in the United States.[27]
***** Socioeconomic context[edit] *****
The principle of interchangeable parts flourished and developed throughout the
19th century, and led to mass_production in many industries. It was based on
the use of templates and other jigs and fixtures, applied by semi-skilled labor
using machine_tools to augment (and later largely replace) the traditional hand
tools. Throughout this century there was much development work to be done in
creating gauges, measuring tools (such as calipers and micrometers), standards
(such as those_for_screw_threads), and processes (such as scientific
management), but the principle of interchangeability remained constant. With
the introduction of the assembly_line at the beginning of the 20th century,
interchangeable parts became ubiquitous elements of manufacturing.
***** Selective assembly[edit] *****
Interchangeability relies on parts' dimensions falling within the tolerance
range. The most common mode of assembly is to design and manufacture such that,
as long as each part that reaches assembly is within tolerance, the mating of
parts can be totally random. This has value for all the reasons already
discussed earlier.
There is another mode of assembly, called "selective assembly", which gives up
some of the randomness capability in trade-off for other value. There are two
main areas of application that benefit economically from selective assembly:
when tolerance ranges are so tight that they cannot quite be held reliably
(making the total randomness unavailable); and when tolerance ranges can be
reliably held, but the fit and finish of the final assembly is being maximized
by voluntarily giving up some of the randomness (which makes it available but
not ideally desirable). In either case the principle of selective assembly is
the same: parts are selected for mating, rather than being mated at random. As
the parts are inspected, they are graded out into separate bins based on what
end of the range they fall in (or violate). Falling within the high or low end
of a range is usually called being heavy or light; violating the high or low
end of a range is usually called being oversize or undersize. Examples are
given below.
French and Vierck[29] provide a one-paragraph description of selective assembly
that aptly summarizes the concept.
One might ask, if parts must be selected for mating, then what makes selective
assembly any different from the oldest craft methods? But there is in fact a
significant difference. Selective assembly merely grades the parts into several
ranges; within each range, there is still random interchangeability. This is
quite different from the older method of fitting by a craftsman, where each
mated set of parts is specifically filed to fit each part with a specific,
unique counterpart.
**** Random assembly not available: oversize and undersize parts[edit] ****
In contexts where the application requires extremely tight (narrow) tolerance
ranges, the requirement may push slightly past the limit of the ability of the
machining and other processes (stamping, rolling, bending, etc.) to stay within
the range. In such cases, selective assembly is used to compensate for a lack
of total interchangeability among the parts. Thus, for a pin that must have a
sliding fit in its hole (free but not sloppy), the dimension may be spec'd as
12.00 +0 â0.01 mm for the pin, and 12.00 +.01 â0 for the hole. Pins that
came out oversize (say a pin at 12.003mm diameter) are not necessarily scrap,
but they can only be mated with counterparts that also came out oversize (say a
hole at 12.013mm). The same is then true for matching undersize parts with
undersize counterparts. Inherent in this example is that for this product's
application, the 12 mm dimension does not require extreme accuracy, but the
desired fit between the parts does require good precision (see the article on
accuracy_and_precision). This allows the makers to "cheat a little" on total
interchangeability in order to get more value out of the manufacturing effort
by reducing the rejection rate (scrap rate). This is a sound engineering
decision as long as the application and context support it. For example, for
machines for which there is no intention for any future field service of a
parts-replacing nature (but rather only simple replacement of the whole unit),
this makes good economic sense. It lowers the unit_cost of the products, and it
does not impede future service work.
An example of a product that might benefit from this approach could be a car
transmission where there is no expectation that the field service person will
repair the old transmission; instead, he will simply swap in a new one.
Therefore, total interchangeability was not absolutely required for the
assemblies inside the transmissions. It would have been specified anyway,
simply on general principle, except for a certain shaft that required precision
so high as to cause great annoyance and high scrap rates in the grinding area,
but for which only decent accuracy was required, as long as the fit with its
hole was good in every case. Money could be saved by saving many shafts from
the scrap bin.
*** Economic and commercial realities[edit] ***
Examples like the one above are not as common in real commerce as they
conceivably could be, mostly because of separation_of_concerns, where each part
of a complex system is expected to give performance that does not make any
limiting assumptions about other parts of the system. In the car transmission
example, the separation of concerns is that individual firms and customers
accept no lack of freedom or options from others in the supply chain. For
example, in the car buyer's view, the car manufacturer is "not within its
rights" to assume that no field-service mechanic will ever repair the old
transmission instead of replacing it. The customer expects that that decision
will be preserved for him to make later, at the repair shop, based on which
option is less expensive for him at that time (figuring that replacing one
shaft is cheaper than replacing a whole transmission). This logic is not always
valid in reality; it might have been better for the customer's total ownership
cost to pay a lower initial price for the car (especially if the transmission
service is covered under the standard warranty for 10 years, and the buyer
intends to replace the car before then anyway) than to pay a higher initial
price for the car but preserve the option of total interchangeability of every
last nut, bolt, and shaft throughout the car (when it is not going to be taken
advantage of anyway). But commerce is generally too chaotically multivariate
for this logic to prevail, so total interchangeability ends up being specified
and achieved even when it adds expense that was "needless" from a holistic view
of the commercial system. But this may be avoided to the extent that customers
experience the overall value (which their minds can detect and appreciate)
without having to understand its logical analysis. Thus buyers of an amazingly
affordable car (surprisingly low initial price) will probably never complain
that the transmission was not field-serviceable as long as they themselves
never had to pay for transmission service in the lifespan of their ownership.
This analysis can be important for the manufacturer to understand (even if it
is lost on the customer), because he can carve for himself a competitive
advantage in the marketplace if he can accurately predict where to "cut
corners" in ways that the customer will never have to pay for. Thus he could
give himself lower transmission unit cost. However, he must be sure when he
does so that the transmissions he's using are reliable, because their
replacement, being covered under a long warranty, will be at his expense.
**** Random assembly available but not ideally desirable: "light" and "heavy"
parts[edit] ****
The other main area of application for selective assembly is in contexts where
total interchangeability is in fact achieved, but the "fit and finish" of the
final products can be enhanced by minimizing the dimensional mismatch between
mating parts. Consider another application similar to the one above with the
12 mm pin. But say that in this example, not only is the precision important
(to produce the desired fit), but the accuracy is also important (because the
12 mm pin must interact with something else that will have to be accurately
sized at 12 mm). Some of the implications of this example are that the
rejection rate cannot be lowered; all parts must fall within tolerance range or
be scrapped. So there are no savings to be had from salvaging oversize or
undersize parts from scrap, then. However, there is still one bit of value to
be had from selective assembly: having all the mated pairs have as close to
identical sliding fit as possible (as opposed to some tighter fits and some
looser fitsâall sliding, but with varying resistance).
An example of a product that might benefit from this approach could be a
toolroom-grade machine_tool, where not only is the accuracy highly important
but also the fit and finish.

      Meanwhile Carthage was mass producing warships. And that's not an
      exaggeration either about numbers or about shipbuilding methods;
      Carthaginian warships were built up of standard interchangeable parts. We
      know this not only from contemporary accounts, but also from recovered
      Carthaginian ships like the half of a Carthaginian ship shown in (c),
      above, that was recovered off the coast of Marsala at the western tip of
      Sicily; it was brand new when it was sunk by the Romans, and it still
      retains marks giving assembly instructions ("tab a into slot b", etc.)
      Other recovered ships had identical parts.
