Operations research (British_English: operational research) (OR) is a
discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to
help make better decisions.[1] Further, the term operational analysis is used
in the British (and some British Commonwealth) military as an intrinsic part of
capability development, management and assurance. In particular, operational
analysis forms part of the Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment
Appraisals, which support British defense capability acquisition decision-
making.
It is often considered to be a sub-field of applied_mathematics.[2] The terms
management_science and decision_science are sometimes used as synonyms.[3]
Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences, such as mathematical
modeling, statistical_analysis, and mathematical_optimization, operations
research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-
making problems. Because of its emphasis on human-technology interaction and
because of its focus on practical applications, operations research has overlap
with other disciplines, notably industrial_engineering and operations
management, and draws on psychology and organization_science. Operations
research is often concerned with determining the extreme values of some real-
world objective: the maximum (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of
loss, risk, or cost). Originating in military efforts before World War II, its
techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.[4]

***** Overview[edit] *****
Operational research (OR) encompasses a wide range of problem-solving
techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decision-making and
efficiency, such as simulation, mathematical_optimization, queueing_theory and
other stochastic-process models, Markov_decision_processes, econometric
methods, data_envelopment_analysis, neural_networks, expert_systems, decision
analysis, and the analytic_hierarchy_process.[5] Nearly all of these techniques
involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the
system. Because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these
fields, OR also has strong ties to computer_science and analytics. Operational
researchers faced with a new problem must determine which of these techniques
are most appropriate given the nature of the system, the goals for improvement,
and constraints on time and computing power.
The major sub-disciplines in modern operational research, as identified by the
journal Operations Research,[6] are:
    * Computing and information technologies
    * Financial_engineering
    * Manufacturing, service_sciences, and supply_chain_management
    * Policy modeling and public sector work
    * Revenue management
    * Simulation
    * Stochastic_models
    * Transportation
***** History[edit] *****
In the decades after the two world wars, the tools of operations research were
more widely applied to problems in business, industry and society. Since that
time, operational research has expanded into a field widely used in industries
ranging from petrochemicals to airlines, finance, logistics, and government,
moving to a focus on the development of mathematical models that can be used to
analyse and optimize complex systems, and has become an area of active academic
and industrial research.[4]
**** Historical origins[edit] ****
In the 17th century, mathematicians like Christiaan_Huygens and Blaise_Pascal
(problem_of_points) tried to solve problems involving complex decisions with
probability. Others in the 18th and 19th centuries solved these types of
problems with combinatorics. Charles_Babbage's research into the cost of
transportation and sorting of mail led to England's universal_"Penny_Post" in
1840, and studies into the dynamical behaviour of railway vehicles in defence
of the GWR's broad gauge.[7] Beginning in the 20th century, study of inventory
management could be considered the origin of modern operations research with
economic_order_quantity developed by Ford_W._Harris in 1913. Operational
research may have originated in the efforts of military planners during World
War I (convoy theory and Lanchester's_laws). Percy_Bridgman brought operational
research to bear on problems in physics in the 1920s and would later attempt to
extend these to the social sciences.[8]
Modern operational research originated at the Bawdsey_Research_Station in the
UK in 1937 and was the result of an initiative of the station's superintendent,
A._P._Rowe. Rowe conceived the idea as a means to analyse and improve the
working of the UK's early_warning_radar system, Chain_Home (CH). Initially, he
analysed the operating of the radar equipment and its communication networks,
expanding later to include the operating personnel's behaviour. This revealed
unappreciated limitations of the CH network and allowed remedial action to be
taken.[9]
Scientists in the United Kingdom including Patrick_Blackett (later Lord
Blackett OM PRS), Cecil_Gordon, Solly_Zuckerman, (later Baron Zuckerman OM,
KCB, FRS), C._H._Waddington, Owen_Wansbrough-Jones, Frank_Yates, Jacob
Bronowski and Freeman_Dyson, and in the United States with George_Dantzig
looked for ways to make better decisions in such areas as logistics and
training schedules
**** Second World War[edit] ****
The modern field of operational research arose during World War II.[dubious  –
discuss] In the World War II era, operational research was defined as "a
scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis
for decisions regarding the operations under their control".[10] Other names
for it included operational analysis (UK Ministry of Defence from 1962)[11] and
quantitative management.[12]
During the Second_World_War close to 1,000 men and women in Britain were
engaged in operational research. About 200 operational research scientists
worked for the British_Army.[13]
Patrick_Blackett worked for several different organizations during the war.
Early in the war while working for the Royal_Aircraft_Establishment (RAE) he
set up a team known as the "Circus" which helped to reduce the number of anti-
aircraft_artillery rounds needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft from an
average of over 20,000 at the start of the Battle_of_Britain to 4,000 in 1941.
[14]

In 1941, Blackett moved from the RAE to the Navy, after first working with RAF
Coastal_Command, in 1941 and then early in 1942 to the Admiralty.[15]
Blackett's team at Coastal Command's Operational Research Section (CC-ORS)
included two future Nobel_prize winners and many other people who went on to be
pre-eminent in their fields.[16] They undertook a number of crucial analyses
that aided the war effort. Britain introduced the convoy system to reduce
shipping losses, but while the principle of using warships to accompany
merchant ships was generally accepted, it was unclear whether it was better for
convoys to be small or large. Convoys travel at the speed of the slowest
member, so small convoys can travel faster. It was also argued that small
convoys would be harder for German U-boats to detect. On the other hand, large
convoys could deploy more warships against an attacker. Blackett's staff showed
that the losses suffered by convoys depended largely on the number of escort
vessels present, rather than the size of the convoy. Their conclusion was that
a few large convoys are more defensible than many small ones.[17]
While performing an analysis of the methods used by RAF_Coastal_Command to hunt
and destroy submarines, one of the analysts asked what colour the aircraft
were. As most of them were from Bomber Command they were painted black for
night-time operations. At the suggestion of CC-ORS a test was run to see if
that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in
the grey North Atlantic skies. Tests showed that aircraft painted white were on
average not spotted until they were 20% closer than those painted black. This
change indicated that 30% more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the
same number of sightings.[18] As a result of these findings Coastal Command
changed their aircraft to using white undersurfaces.
Other work by the CC-ORS indicated that on average if the trigger depth of
aerial-delivered depth_charges (DCs) were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet, the
kill ratios would go up. The reason was that if a U-boat saw an aircraft only
shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do
no damage (because the U-boat wouldn't have had time to descend as far as 100
feet), and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to
alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20-foot kill
zone of the charges was small. It was more efficient to attack those submarines
close to the surface when the targets' locations were better known than to
attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be
guessed. Before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet, 1% of
submerged U-boats were sunk and 14% damaged. After the change, 7% were sunk and
11% damaged; if submarines were caught on the surface but had time to submerge
just before being attacked, the numbers rose to 11% sunk and 15% damaged.
Blackett observed "there can be few cases where such a great operational gain
had been obtained by such a small and simple change of tactics".[19]
Map of Kammhuber_Line
Bomber Command's Operational Research Section (BC-ORS), analyzed a report of a
survey carried out by RAF_Bomber_Command.[citation_needed] For the survey,
Bomber Command inspected all bombers returning from bombing raids over Germany
over a particular period. All damage inflicted by German air_defences was noted
and the recommendation was given that armour be added in the most heavily
damaged areas. This recommendation was not adopted because the fact that the
aircraft were able to return with these areas damaged indicated the areas were
not vital, and adding armour to non-vital areas where damage is acceptable
reduces aircraft performance. Their suggestion to remove some of the crew so
that an aircraft loss would result in fewer personnel losses, was also rejected
by RAF command. Blackett's team made the logical recommendation that the armour
be placed in the areas which were completely untouched by damage in the bombers
which returned. They reasoned that the survey was biased, since it only
included aircraft that returned to Britain. The areas untouched in returning
aircraft were probably vital areas, which, if hit, would result in the loss of
the aircraft.[20] This story has been disputed,[21] with a similar damage
assessment study completed in the US by the Statistical Research Group at
Columbia University,[22] the result of work done by Abraham_Wald[23].
When Germany organized its air defences into the Kammhuber_Line, it was
realized by the British that if the RAF bombers were to fly in a bomber_stream
they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew in individual cells directed
to their targets by ground controllers. It was then a matter of calculating the
statistical loss from collisions against the statistical loss from night
fighters to calculate how close the bombers should fly to minimize RAF losses.
[24]
The "exchange rate" ratio of output to input was a characteristic feature of
operational research. By comparing the number of flying hours put in by Allied
aircraft to the number of U-boat sightings in a given area, it was possible to
redistribute aircraft to more productive patrol areas. Comparison of exchange
rates established "effectiveness ratios" useful in planning. The ratio of 60
mines laid per ship sunk was common to several campaigns: German mines in
British ports, British mines on German routes, and United States mines in
Japanese routes.[25]
Operational research doubled the on-target bomb rate of B-29s bombing Japan
from the Marianas_Islands by increasing the training ratio from 4 to 10 percent
of flying hours; revealed that wolf-packs of three United States submarines
were the most effective number to enable all members of the pack to engage
targets discovered on their individual patrol stations; revealed that glossy
enamel paint was more effective camouflage for night fighters than traditional
dull camouflage paint finish, and a smooth paint finish increased airspeed by
reducing skin friction.[25]
On land, the operational research sections of the Army Operational Research
Group (AORG) of the Ministry_of_Supply (MoS) were landed in Normandy_in_1944,
and they followed British forces in the advance across Europe. They analyzed,
among other topics, the effectiveness of artillery, aerial bombing and anti-
tank shooting.
**** After World War II[edit] ****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (March
         2010)
With expanded techniques and growing awareness of the field at the close of the
war, operational research was no longer limited to only operational, but was
extended to encompass equipment procurement, training, logistics and
infrastructure. Operations Research also grew in many areas other than the
military once scientists learned to apply its principles to the civilian
sector. With the development of the simplex_algorithm for linear_programming in
1947[26] and the development of computers over the next three decades,
Operations Research can now "solve problems with hundreds of thousands of
variables and constraints. Moreover, the large volumes of data required for
such problems can be stored and manipulated very efficiently."[26]

Operational research is also used extensively in government where evidence-
based_policy is used.
***** Management science[edit] *****
Main article: Management_science
In 1967 Stafford_Beer characterized the field of management science as "the
business use of operations research".[29] However, in modern times the term
management science may also be used to refer to the separate fields of
organizational_studies or corporate_strategy.[citation_needed] Like operational
research itself, management science (MS) is an interdisciplinary branch of
applied mathematics devoted to optimal decision planning, with strong links
with economics, business, engineering, and other sciences. It uses various
scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical_methods
including mathematical_modeling, statistics and numerical_algorithms to improve
an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions
by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems.
Management scientists help businesses to achieve their goals using the
scientific methods of operational research.
The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-
based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. Of course, the
techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications
but may be applied to military, medical, public administration, charitable
groups, political groups or community groups.
Management science is concerned with developing and applying models and
concepts that may prove useful in helping to illuminate management issues and
solve managerial problems, as well as designing and developing new and better
models of organizational excellence.[30]
The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as
management science.[31]
**** Related fields[edit] ****
Some of the fields that have considerable overlap with Operations Research and
Management Science include[32]:
    * Business_analytics
    * Computer_science
    * Data_mining/Data_science/Big_data
    * Decision_analysis
    * Decision_intelligence
    * Engineering
    * Financial_engineering
    * Forecasting
    * Game_theory
    * Geography/Geographic_information_science
    * Graph_theory
    * Industrial_engineering
    * Logistics
    * Mathematical_modeling
    * Mathematical_optimization
    * Probability_and_statistics
    * Project_management
    * Policy_analysis
    * Simulation
    * Social_network/Transportation_forecasting models
    * Stochastic_processes
    * Supply_chain_management
**** Applications[edit] ****
Applications are abundant such as in airlines, manufacturing companies, service
organizations, military branches, and government. The range of problems and
issues to which it has contributed insights and solutions is vast. It includes:
[30]
    * Scheduling (of airlines, trains, buses etc.)
    * Assignment (assigning crew to flights, trains or buses; employees to
      projects; commitment and dispatch of power generation facilities)
    * Facility location (deciding most appropriate location for new facilities
      such as warehouse; factory or fire station)
    * Hydraulics & Piping Engineering (managing flow of water from reservoirs)
    * Health Services (information and supply chain management)
    * Game Theory (identifying, understanding; developing strategies adopted by
      companies)
    * Urban Design
    * Computer Network Engineering (packet routing; timing; analysis)
    * Telecom & Data Communication Engineering (packet routing; timing;
      analysis)
[33]
Management is also concerned with so-called 'soft-operational analysis' which
concerns methods for strategic_planning, strategic decision_support, problem
structuring_methods. In dealing with these sorts of challenges, mathematical
modeling_and_simulation may not be appropriate or may not suffice. Therefore,
during the past 30 years[vague], a number of non-quantified modeling methods
have been developed. These include:[citation_needed]
    * stakeholder based approaches including metagame_analysis and drama_theory
    * morphological_analysis and various forms of influence_diagrams
    * cognitive mapping
    * strategic choice
    * robustness analysis
***** Societies and journals[edit] *****
**** Societies[edit] ****
The International_Federation_of_Operational_Research_Societies (IFORS)[34] is
an umbrella_organization for operational research societies worldwide,
representing approximately 50 national societies including those in the US,[35]
UK,[36] France,[37] Germany, Italy,[38] Canada,[39] Australia,[40] New Zealand,
[41] Philippines,[42] India,[43] Japan and South Africa.[44] The constituent
members of IFORS form regional groups, such as that in Europe, the Association
of_European_Operational_Research_Societies (EURO).[45] Other important
operational research organizations are Simulation_Interoperability_Standards
Organization (SISO)[46] and Interservice/Industry_Training,_Simulation_and
Education_Conference (I/ITSEC)[47]
In 2004 the US-based organization INFORMS began an initiative to market the OR
profession better, including a website entitled The Science of Better[48] which
provides an introduction to OR and examples of successful applications of OR to
industrial problems. This initiative has been adopted by the Operational
Research_Society in the UK, including a website entitled Learn about OR.[49]
**** Journals of INFORMS[edit] ****
The Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences (INFORMS)
