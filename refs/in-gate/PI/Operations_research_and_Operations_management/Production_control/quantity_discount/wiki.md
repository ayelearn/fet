Discounts and allowances are reductions to a basic price of goods or services.
They can occur anywhere in the distribution_channel, modifying either the
manufacturer's list price (determined by the manufacturer and often printed on
the package), the retail price (set by the retailer and often attached to the
product with a sticker), or the list price (which is quoted to a potential
buyer, usually in written form).
There are many purposes for discounting, including to increase short-term
sales, to move out-of-date stock, to reward valuable customers, to encourage
distribution_channel members to perform a function, or to otherwise reward
behaviors that benefit the discount issuer. Some discounts and allowances are
forms of sales_promotion. Many are price_discrimination methods that allow the
seller to capture some of the consumer_surplus.

***** Types[edit] *****
The most common types of discounts and allowances are listed below.
**** Dealing with payment[edit] ****
*** Prompt payment discount [edit] ***
Trade Discounts are deductions in price given by the wholesaler or manufacturer
to the retailer at the list_price or catalogue price. Cash Discounts are
reductions in price given to the debtor to motivate the debtor to make payment
within specified time. These discounts are intended to speed payment and
thereby provide cash_flow to the firm. They are sometimes used as a promotional
device.
** Examples[edit] **
    * 2/10 net 30 - this means the buyer must pay within 30 days of the invoice
      date, but will receive a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days of the
      invoice date.
    * 3/7 EOM - this means the buyer will receive a cash discount of 3% if the
      bill is paid within 7 days after the end of the month indicated on the
      invoice date. If an invoice is received on or before the 25th day of the
      month, payment is due on the 7th day of the next calendar month. If a
      proper invoice is received after the 25th day of the month, payment is
      due on the 7th day of the second calendar month.
    * 3/7 EOM net 30 - this means the buyer must pay within 30 days of the
      invoice date, but will receive a 3% discount if they pay within 7 days
      after the end of the month indicated on the invoice date. If an invoice
      is received on or before the 25th day of the month, payment is due on the
      7th day of the next calendar month. If a proper invoice is received after
      the 25th day of the month, payment is due on the 7th day of the second
      calendar month.
    * 2/15 net 40 ROG - this means the buyer must pay within 40 days of receipt
      of goods, but will receive a 2% discount if paid in 15 days of the
      invoice date. (ROG is short for "Receipt of goods.")
*** Preferred payment method discount [edit] ***
Some retailers (particularly small retailers with low margins) offer discounts
to customers paying with cash, to avoid paying fees on credit_card
transactions.
*** Partial payment discount [edit] ***
Similar to the Trade discount, this is used when the seller wishes to improve
cash_flow or liquidity, but finds that the buyer typically is unable to meet
the desired discount deadline. A partial discount for whatever payment the
buyer makes helps the seller's cash flow partially.
*** Sliding scale[edit] ***
Main article: Sliding_scale_fees
A discount offered based on one's ability to pay. More common with non-profit
organizations than with for-profit retail.
*** Forward dating [edit] ***
This is where the purchaser doesnât pay for the goods until well after they
arrive. The date on the invoice is moved forward - example: purchase goods in
November for sale during the December holiday season, but the payment date on
the invoice is January 27.
*** Seasonal discount [edit] ***
Seasonal Sales promotion
These are price reductions given when an order is placed in a slack period
(example: purchasing skis in April in the northern hemisphere, or in September
in the southern hemisphere). On a shorter time scale, a happy_hour may fall in
this category. Generally, this discount is referred to as "X-Dating" or "Ex-
Dating". An example of X-Dating would be:
    * 3/7 net 30 extra 10 - this means the buyer must pay within 30 days of the
      invoice date, but will receive a 3% discount if they pay within 7 days
      after the end of the month indicated on the invoice date plus an extra 10
      days.
**** Dealing with trade[edit] ****
*** Bargaining[edit] ***
Main article: Bargaining
Bargaining is where the seller and the buyer negotiate a price below the
original asking price.
*** Trade discount[edit] ***
Trade discounts, also called functional discounts, are payments to distribution
channel members for performing some function. Examples of these functions are
warehousing and shelf stocking. Trade discounts are often combined to include a
series of functions, for example 20/12/5 could indicate a 20% discount for
warehousing the product, an additional 12% discount for shipping the product,
and an additional 5% discount for keeping the shelves stocked. Trade discounts
are most frequent in industries where retailers hold the majority of the power
in the distribution channel (referred to as channel captains).
Trade discounts are given to try to increase the volume of sales being made by
the supplier.
The discount described as trade rate discount is sometimes called "trade
discount". Trade discount is the discount allowed on retail price of a product
or something. for e.g. Retail price of a cream is 25 and trade discount is 2%
on 25.
*** Trade rate discount [edit] ***
A trade rate discount, sometimes also called "trade discount", is offered by a
seller to a buyer for purposes of trade or reselling, rather than to an end
user. For example, a pharmacist might offer a discount for over-the-counter
drugs to physicians who are purchasing them for dispensing to the physicians'
own patients.[1] A seller supplying both trade or resellers, and the general
public will have a general list price for anybody, and will offer a trade
discount to bona-fide trade customers.
**** Trade-in credit[edit] ****
Trade-in credit, also called trade-up credit, is a discount or credit granted
for the return of something. The returned item may have little monetary value,
as an old version of newer item being bought, or may be worth reselling as
second-hand. The idea from a seller's viewpoint is to offer some discount but
have the buyer showing some "counter action" to earn this special discount.
Sellers like this as the discount granted is not just "given for free" and
makes future price/value negotiations easier. Buyers have the advantage of
getting some value for something no longer used. Examples can be found in many
industries.[2]
**** Dealing with quantity[edit] ****
These are price reductions given for bulk_purchasing. The rationale behind them
is to obtain economies_of_scale and pass some (or all) of these savings on to
the customer. In some industries, buyer groups and co-ops have formed to take
advantage of these discounts. Generally there are two types:
*** Cumulative quantity discount[edit] ***
Cumulative quantity discounts, also called accumulation discounts, are price
reductions based on the quantity purchased over a set period of time. The
expectation is that they will impose an implied switching cost and thereby bond
the purchaser to the seller.
*** Non-cumulative quantity discount [edit] ***
These are price reductions based on the quantity of a single order. The
expectation is that they will encourage larger orders, thus reducing billing,
order filling, shipping, and sales personnel expenses.
*** Dependence of price on quantity [edit] ***
An extreme form of quantity discount occurs when, within a quantity range, the
price does not depend on quantity:
    * If you want less than the minimum amount, you must pay the minimum amount
      anyway.
    * If you want an amount between two of the fixed amounts offered, you must
      pay the higher amount.
This also applies in the case of a service where the "quantity" is time. For
example, an entrance_ticket for a zoo is usually for a day. If you leave in the
middle of the day, the price is the same. Other examples are multi-day passes
to amusement parks or season tickets to sporting events.
If one has to buy more than one wants, we can distinguish between the surplus
just not being used, or the surplus being a nuisance, e.g. because of having to
carry a large container.
**** Dealing with customer characteristics[edit] ****
The following discounts have to do with specific characteristics of the
customer.
*** Disability discount [edit] ***
A discount offered to customers with what is considered to be a disability.
*** Educational or student discount[edit] ***
These are price reductions given to members of educational institutions,
usually students but possibly also to educators and to other institution staff.
The provider's purpose is to build brand awareness early in a buyer's life, or
build product familiarity so that after graduation the holder is likely to buy
the same product, for own use or for an employer, at its normal price.
Providers also offer student discounts as means of offering a product within
the budget of a student, which would otherwise be too expensive, thus gaining
extra sales. Educational discounts may be given by merchants directly, or via a
student discount program.
*** Employee discount [edit] ***
A discount offered by a company to employees who buy its products.
In 2005, the American automakers ran an "employee_discount"_for_all_customers
promotional campaign in order to entice buyers, with some success.
*** Military discount [edit] ***
A discount offered to customers who are or were members of a military_service.
Types of military discounts include discounts for active duty military,
veterans, retired military personnel, and military spouses or dependents. In
the United States, military discounts frequently require proof of ID to show
eligibility such as a DD Form 214, DD Form 215, or DD Form 217 from any branch
of the Armed Forces, TRICARE Cards, Veterans Affairs Cards Uniformed Services
Privilege and Identification Cards (USPIC) or other official documentation.
Eligibility for military discounts can also be verified online or via mobile by
verification companies like SheerID.
*** Age-related discounts[edit] ***
** Toddler discount, child discount, kid discount[edit] **
A discount, or free service, offered to children younger than a certain age,
commonly for admission to entertainments and attractions, restaurants, and
hotels. There may be a requirement that the child be accompanied by an adult
paying full price. Small children often travel free on public_transport, and
older ones may pay a substantially discounted price; proof of age may be
required.
** Young person's discount[edit] **
Discounts are sometimes offered to young people below a certain age who are
neither children nor in education.[3]
** Senior discount[edit] **
"Senior discount" redirects here. For the band, see Senior_Discount_(band).
A discount offered to customers who are above a certain relatively advanced
age, typically a round number such as 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75; the exact age
varies in different cases. The rationale for a senior discount offered by
companies is that the customer is assumed to be retired and living on a limited
income, and unlikely to be willing to pay full price; sales at reduced price
are better than no sales. Non-commercial organizations may offer concessionary
prices as a matter of social policy.[4] Free or reduced-rate travel is often
available to older people (see, for example, Freedom_Pass). In United States
most grocery stores offer senior discounts, starting for those age 50 or older,
but most discounts are offered for those over 60.[5]
*** Special prices offered to friends of the seller[edit] ***
A discounted price offered to friends of the salesperson, an attitude which is
parodied in the stereotype of a salesman saying "It costs [such-and such], but
for you..." In Australia, New_Zealand, and the UK, discounts to friends are
known as "mates' rates."[6][7] In French this discount is known as prix d'ami.
[8] In Spain this is known as "precio de amigo" in Spanish, or "preu d'amic" in
Catalan. In German the term "Freundschaftspreis" is commonly used.
*** Special prices offered to local residents[edit] ***
Discounts are common in tourist destinations. In Hawaii, for example, many
tourist attractions, hotels, and restaurants charge a deeply discounted price
to someone who shows proof that they live in Hawaii; this is known as a
"Kama'aina discount," after the Hawaiian word for an old-timer or native.[9] It
is also known outside of Hawaii but in the Hawaiian islands as a resident
discount.
**** Discount card[edit] ****
Main article: Discount_card
Sometimes a document, typically a plastic card similar to a payment_card, is
issued as proof of eligibility for discounts. In other cases, existing
documents proving status (as student, disabled, resident, etc.) are accepted.
Documentation may not be required, for example, for people who are obviously
young or old enough to qualify for age-related discounts. In some cases, the
card may be issued to anyone who asks.
**** Coupons[edit] ****
Main article: Coupon
A discount, either of a certain specified amount or a percentage to the holder
of a voucher, usually with certain terms. Commonly, there are restrictions as
for other discounts, such as being valid only if a certain quantity is bought
or only if the customer is older than a specified age. Coupons are often
printed in newspapers, brochures, and magazines, or can be downloaded from the
Internet.
**** Rebates[edit] ****
Main article: Rebate_(marketing)
A refund of part or sometimes the full price of the product following purchase,
though some rebates are offered at the time of purchase. A particular case is
the promise of a refund in full if applied for in a restricted date range some
years in the future; the hope is that the promise will lure customers and
increase sales, but that the majority will fail to meet the conditions for a
valid claim.
**** Other[edit] ****
    * Promotional allowances - These are price reductions given to the buyer
      for performing some promotional activity. These include an allowance for
      creating and maintaining an in-store display or a co-op advertising
      allowance.
    * Brokerage allowance - From the point of view of the manufacturer, any
      brokerage fee paid is similar to a promotional allowance. It is usually
      based on a percentage of the sales generated by the broker.
