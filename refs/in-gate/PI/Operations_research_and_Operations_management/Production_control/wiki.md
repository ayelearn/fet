From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Production control is the activity of monitoring and controlling any particular
production or operation. Production control is often run from a specific
control room or operations room. With inventory_control and quality_control,
production control is one of the key functions of operations_management.[1]

***** Overview[edit] *****
Production control is the activity of monitoring and controlling a large
physical facility or physically dispersed service. It is a "set of actions and
decision taken during production to regulate output and obtain reasonable
assurance that the specification will be met."[2] The American_Production_and
Inventory_Control_Society, nowadays APICS, defined production control in 1959
as:
      Production control is the task of predicting, planning and scheduling
      work, taking into account manpower, materials availability and other
      capacity restrictions, and cost so as to achieve proper quality and
      quantity at the time it is needed and then following up the schedule to
      see that the plan is carried out, using whatever systems have proven
      satisfactory for the purpose.[3]
Production planning and control in larger factories is often run from a
production planning department run by production controllers and a production
control manager. Production monitoring and control of larger operations is
often run from a central space, called a control_room or operations_room or
operations control center (OCC).
The emerging area of Project Production Management (PPM), based on viewing
project activities as a production system, adopts the same notion of production
control to take steps to regulate the behavior of a production system where in
this case the production system is a capital project, rather than a physical
facility or a physically dispersed service.
Production control is to be contrasted with project controls. As explained,[4]
project controls have developed to become centralized functions to track
project progress and identify deviations from plan and to forecast future
progress, using metrics rooted in accounting principles.
***** Types[edit] *****
Powerplant control room, 1983
One type of production control is the control of manufacturing operations.
    * Production_planning and control of the when and where.
    * Production control and supply_chain_management
Management of real-time operational in specific fields.
    * Production control in the television_studio in a production_control_room
    * Master_control in television studio
    * Production control in spaceflight in a Mission Operations Control Room
Communist countries had a central production control institute, where the
agricultural and industrial production for the whole nation was planned and
controlled.
In Customer Care environments production control is known as Workforce
Management (WFM). Centralized Workforce Management teams are often called
Command Center, Mission Control or WFM Shared Production Centers.
***** Related types of control in organizations[edit] *****
Production control is just one of multiple types of control in organizations.
Most commons other types are:
    * Management_control, one of the managerial functions like planning,
      organizing, staffing and directing. It is an important function because
      it helps to check the errors and to take the corrective action so that
      deviation from standards are minimized and stated goals of the
      organization are achieved in a desired manner.
    * Inventory_control, the supervision of supply, storage and accessibility
      of items in order to ensure an adequate supply without excessive
      oversupply.
    * Quality_control, the process by which entities review the quality of all
      factors involved in production.
