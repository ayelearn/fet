Capillary action of water compared to mercury, in each case with respect to a
polar surface such as glass
Capillary action (sometimes capillarity, capillary motion, capillary effect, or
wicking) is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the
assistance of, or even in opposition to, external forces like gravity. The
effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hairs of a paint-
brush, in a thin tube, in porous materials such as paper and plaster, in some
non-porous materials such as sand and liquefied carbon_fiber, or in a
biological_cell. It occurs because of intermolecular_forces between the liquid
and surrounding solid surfaces. If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently
small, then the combination of surface_tension (which is caused by cohesion
within the liquid) and adhesive_forces between the liquid and container wall
act to propel the liquid.[1]

***** History[edit] *****
The first recorded observation of capillary action was by Leonardo_da_Vinci.[2]
[3] A former student of Galileo, NiccolÃ²_Aggiunti [it], was said to have
investigated capillary action.[4] In 1660, capillary action was still a novelty
to the Irish chemist Robert_Boyle, when he reported that "some inquisitive
French Men" had observed that when a capillary tube was dipped into water, the
water would ascend to "some height in the Pipe". Boyle then reported an
experiment in which he dipped a capillary tube into red wine and then subjected
the tube to a partial vacuum. He found that the vacuum had no observable
influence on the height of the liquid in the capillary, so the behavior of
liquids in capillary tubes was due to some phenomenon different from that which
governed mercury barometers.[5]
Others soon followed Boyle's lead.[6] Some (e.g., HonorÃ©_Fabri,[7] Jacob
Bernoulli[8]) thought that liquids rose in capillaries because air could not
enter capillaries as easily as liquids, so the air pressure was lower inside
capillaries. Others (e.g., Isaac_Vossius,[9] Giovanni_Alfonso_Borelli,[10]
Louis_CarrÃ©,[11] Francis_Hauksbee,[12] Josia_Weitbrecht[13]) thought that the
particles of liquid were attracted to each other and to the walls of the
capillary.
Although experimental studies continued during the 18th century,[14] a
successful quantitative treatment of capillary action[15] was not attained
until 1805 by two investigators: Thomas_Young of the United Kingdom[16] and
Pierre-Simon_Laplace of France.[17] They derived the YoungâLaplace_equation
of capillary action. By 1830, the German mathematician Carl_Friedrich_Gauss had
determined the boundary conditions governing capillary action (i.e., the
conditions at the liquid-solid interface).[18] In 1871, the British physicist
William_Thomson_(Lord_Kelvin) determined the effect of the meniscus on a
liquid's vapor_pressureâa relation known as the Kelvin_equation.[19] German
physicist Franz_Ernst_Neumann (1798â1895) subsequently determined the
interaction between two immiscible liquids.[20]
Albert_Einstein's first paper, which was submitted to Annalen_der_Physik in
1900, was on capillarity.[21][22]
***** Phenomena and physics[edit] *****
Capillary flow experiment to investigate capillary flows and phenomena aboard
the International_Space_Station
Capillary penetration in porous media shares its dynamic mechanism with flow in
hollow tubes, as both processes are resisted by viscous forces.[23]
Consequently, a common apparatus used to demonstrate the phenomenon is the
capillary tube. When the lower end of a glass tube is placed in a liquid, such
as water, a concave meniscus forms. Adhesion occurs between the fluid and the
solid inner wall pulling the liquid column along until there is a sufficient
mass of liquid for gravitational_forces to overcome these intermolecular
forces. The contact length (around the edge) between the top of the liquid
column and the tube is proportional to the radius of the tube, while the weight
of the liquid column is proportional to the square of the tube's radius. So, a
narrow tube will draw a liquid column along further than a wider tube will,
given that the inner water molecules cohere sufficiently to the outer ones.
***** In plants and animals[edit] *****
Capillary action is seen in many plants. Water is brought high up in trees by
branching; evaporation at the leaves creating depressurization; probably by
osmotic_pressure added at the roots; and possibly at other locations inside the
plant, especially when gathering humidity with air_roots.[24][25]
Capillary action for uptake of water has been described in some small animals,
such as Ligia_exotica[26] and Moloch_horridus.[27]
***** Examples[edit] *****
In the built environment, evaporation limited capillary penetration is
responsible for the phenomenon of rising_damp in concrete and masonry, while in
industry and diagnostic medicine this phenomenon is increasingly being
harnessed in the field of paper-based_microfluidics.[23]
In physiology, capillary action is essential for the drainage of continuously
produced tear fluid from the eye. Two canaliculi of tiny diameter are present
in the inner corner of the eyelid, also called the lacrimal_ducts; their
openings can be seen with the naked eye within the lacrymal sacs when the
eyelids are everted.
Wicking is the absorption of a liquid by a material in the manner of a candle
wick. Paper_towels absorb liquid through capillary action, allowing a fluid to
be transferred from a surface to the towel. The small pores of a sponge act as
small capillaries, causing it to absorb a large amount of fluid. Some textile
fabrics are said to use capillary action to "wick" sweat away from the skin.
These are often referred to as wicking_fabrics, after the capillary properties
of candle and lamp wicks.
Capillary action is observed in thin_layer_chromatography, in which a solvent
moves vertically up a plate via capillary action. In this case the pores are
gaps between very small particles.
Capillary action draws ink to the tips of fountain_pen nibs from a reservoir or
cartridge inside the pen.
With some pairs of materials, such as mercury and glass, the intermolecular
forces within the liquid exceed those between the solid and the liquid, so a
convex meniscus forms and capillary action works in reverse.
In hydrology, capillary action describes the attraction of water molecules to
soil particles. Capillary action is responsible for moving groundwater from wet
areas of the soil to dry areas. Differences in soil potential (     &#x03A8;  m
{\displaystyle \Psi _{m}}  [\Psi_m]) drive capillary action in soil.
A practical application of capillary action is the capillary action siphon.
Instead of utilizing a hollow tube (as in most siphons), this device consists
of a length of cord made of a fibrous material (cotton cord or string works
well). After saturating the cord with water, one (weighted) end is placed in a
reservoir full of water, and the other end placed in a receiving vessel. Note
that the reservoir must be higher than the receiving vessel. Due to capillary
action and gravity, water will slowly transfer from the reservoir to the
receiving vessel. This simple device can be used to water houseplants when
nobody is home.
***** Height of a meniscus[edit] *****
Water height in a capillary plotted against capillary diameter
The height h of a liquid column is given by Jurin's_law [28]
         h =    2 &#x03B3; cos &#x2061;  &#x03B8;    &#x03C1; g r    ,
      {\displaystyle h={{2\gamma \cos {\theta }} \over {\rho gr}},}  [h={{2
      \gamma \cos{\theta}}\over{\rho g r}},]
where      &#x03B3;    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \gamma }  [\scriptstyle
\gamma ] is the liquid-air surface_tension (force/unit length), Î¸ is the
contact_angle, Ï is the density of liquid (mass/volume), g is the local
acceleration_due_to_gravity (length/square of time[29]), and r is the radius of
tube. Thus the thinner the space in which the water can travel, the further up
it goes.
For a water-filled glass tube in air at standard laboratory conditions, Î³ =
0.0728 N/m at 20 Â°C, Ï = 1000 kg/m3, and g = 9.81 m/s2. For these values, the
height of the water column is
         h &#x2248;    1.48 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 5   &#xA0;    m    2    r
      .   {\displaystyle h\approx {{1.48\times 10^{-5}\ {\mbox{m}}^{2}} \over
      r}.}  [{\displaystyle h\approx {{1.48\times 10^{-5}\ {\mbox{m}}^{2}}
      \over r}.}]
Thus for a 2 m (6.6 ft) radius glass tube in lab conditions given above, the
water would rise an unnoticeable 0.007 mm (0.00028 in). However, for a 2 cm
(0.79 in) radius tube, the water would rise 0.7 mm (0.028 in), and for a 0.2 mm
(0.0079 in) radius tube, the water would rise 70 mm (2.8 in).
***** Liquid transport in porous media[edit] *****
Capillary flow in a brick, with a sorptivity of 5.0 mmÂ·minâ1/2 and a
porosity of 0.25.
When a dry porous medium is brought into contact with a liquid, it will absorb
the liquid at a rate which decreases over time. When considering evaporation,
liquid penetration will reach a limit dependent on parameters of temperature,
humidity and permeability. This process is known as evaporation limited
capillary penetration [23] and is widely observed in common situations
including fluid absorption into paper and rising damp in concrete or masonry
walls. For a bar shaped section of material with cross-sectional area A that is
wetted on one end, the cumulative volume V of absorbed liquid after a time t is
         V = A S   t   ,   {\displaystyle V=AS{\sqrt {t}},}  [V = AS\sqrt{t},]
where S is the sorptivity of the medium, in units of mÂ·sâ1/2 or mmÂ·minâ1/
2. This time dependence relation is similar to Washburn's_equation for the
wicking in capillaries and porous media.[30] The quantity
         i =   V A     {\displaystyle i={\frac {V}{A}}}  [i = \frac{V}{A}]
is called the cumulative liquid intake, with the dimension of length. The
wetted length of the bar, that is the distance between the wetted end of the
bar and the so-called wet front, is dependent on the fraction f of the volume
occupied by voids. This number f is the porosity of the medium; the wetted
length is then
         x =   i f   =   S f     t   .   {\displaystyle x={\frac {i}{f}}={\frac
      {S}{f}}{\sqrt {t}}.}  [x = \frac{i}{f} = \frac{S}{f}\sqrt{t}.]
Some authors use the quantity S/f as the sorptivity.[31] The above description
is for the case where gravity and evaporation do not play a role.
Sorptivity is a relevant property of building materials, because it affects the
amount of rising_dampness. Some values for the sorptivity of building materials
are in the table below.
Material         Sorptivity           Source

          o In 1740, Christlieb Ehregott Gellert (1713â1795) observed that
            like mercury, molten lead would not adhere to glass and therefore
            the level of molten lead was depressed in a capillary tube. See: C.

          o Gaspard_Monge (1746â1818) investigated the force between panes of
            glass that were separated by a film of liquid. See: Gaspard Monge
            (1787) "MÃ©moire_sur_quelques_effets_d'attraction_ou_de_rÃ©pulsion
            apparente_entre_les_molÃ©cules_de_matiÃ¨re" Archived 2016-03-16 at
            the Wayback_Machine (Memoir on some effects of the apparent
            attraction or repulsion between molecules of matter), Histoire de
            l'AcadÃ©mie royale des sciences, avec les MÃ©moires de l'AcadÃ©mie
            Royale des Sciences de Paris (History of the Royal Academy of
            Sciences, with the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of
            Paris), pp. 506â529. Monge proposed that particles of a liquid
            exert, on each other, a short-range force of attraction, and that
            this force produces the surface tension of the liquid. From p. 529:
            "En supposant ainsi que l'adhÃ©rence des molÃ©cules d'un liquide
            n'ait d'effet sensible qu'Ã  la surface mÃªme, & dans le sens de la
            surface, il seroit facile de dÃ©terminer la courbure des surfaces
            des liquides dans le voisinage des parois qui les conteinnent ; ces
            surfaces seroient des lintÃ©aires dont la tension, constante dans
            tous les sens, seroit par-tout Ã©gale Ã  l'adhÃ©rence de deux
            molÃ©cules ; & les phÃ©nomÃ¨nes des tubes capillaires n'auroient
            plus rein qui ne pÃ»t Ãªtre dÃ©terminÃ© par l'analyse." (Thus by
            assuming that the adhesion of a liquid's molecules has a
            significant effect only at the surface itself, and in the direction
            of the surface, it would be easy to determine the curvature of the
            surfaces of liquids in the vicinity of the walls that contain
            them ; these surfaces would be menisci whose tension, [being]
            constant in every direction, would be everywhere equal to the
            adhesion of two molecules ; and the phenomena of capillary tubes
            would have nothing that could not be determined by analysis [i.e.,
            calculus].)
