A beam of cathode rays in a vacuum tube bent into a circle by a magnetic_field
generated by a Helmholtz_coil. Cathode rays are normally invisible; in this
demonstration tube enough residual gas has been left that the gas atoms glow
from luminescence when struck by the fast moving electrons.
Cathode rays (electron beam or e-beam) are streams of electrons observed in
vacuum_tubes. If an evacuated glass tube is equipped with two electrodes and a
voltage is applied, glass behind the positive electrode is observed to glow,
due to electrons emitted from the cathode (the electrode connected to the
negative terminal of the voltage supply). They were first observed in 1869 by
German physicist Julius_PlÃ¼cker and Johann_Wilhelm_Hittorf,[1] and were named
in 1876 by Eugen_Goldstein Kathodenstrahlen, or cathode rays.[2][3] In 1897,
British physicist J._J._Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of a
previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later named the
electron. Cathode_ray_tubes (CRTs) use a focused beam of electrons deflected by
electric or magnetic fields to render an image on a screen.

***** Description[edit] *****
A diagram showing a Crookes tube connected to a high voltage supply. The
Maltese cross has no external electrical connection.
Cathode rays are so named because they are emitted by the negative electrode,
or cathode, in a vacuum tube. To release electrons into the tube, they first
must be detached from the atoms of the cathode. In the early cold_cathode
vacuum tubes, called Crookes_tubes, this was done by using a high electrical
potential of thousands of volts between the anode and the cathode to ionize the
residual gas atoms in the tube. The positive ions were accelerated by the
electric_field toward the cathode, and when they collided with it they knocked
electrons out of its surface; these were the cathode rays. Modern vacuum tubes
use thermionic_emission, in which the cathode is made of a thin wire filament
which is heated by a separate electric_current passing through it. The
increased random heat motion of the filament knocks electrons out of the
surface of the filament, into the evacuated space of the tube.
Since the electrons have a negative charge, they are repelled by the negative
cathode and attracted to the positive anode. They travel in straight lines
through the empty tube. The voltage applied between the electrodes accelerates
these low mass particles to high velocities. Cathode rays are invisible, but
their presence was first detected in early vacuum tubes when they struck the
glass wall of the tube, exciting the atoms of the glass and causing them to
emit light, a glow called fluorescence. Researchers noticed that objects placed
in the tube in front of the cathode could cast a shadow on the glowing wall,
and realized that something must be travelling in straight lines from the
cathode. After the electrons reach the anode, they travel through the anode
wire to the power supply and back to the cathode, so cathode rays carry
electric current through the tube.
The current in a beam of cathode rays through a vacuum tube can be controlled
by passing it through a metal screen of wires (a grid) between cathode and
anode, to which a small negative voltage is applied. The electric field of the
wires deflects some of the electrons, preventing them from reaching the anode.
The amount of current that gets through to the anode depends on the voltage on
the grid. Thus, a small voltage on the grid can be made to control a much
larger voltage on the anode. This is the principle used in vacuum_tubes to
amplify electrical signals. The triode vacuum tube developed between 1907 and
1914 was the first electronic device that could amplify, and is still used in
some applications such as radio_transmitters. High speed beams of cathode rays
can also be steered and manipulated by electric_fields created by additional
metal plates in the tube to which voltage is applied, or magnetic_fields
created by coils of wire (electromagnets). These are used in cathode_ray_tubes,
found in televisions and computer monitors, and in electron_microscopes.
    * Crookes tube. The cathode (negative terminal) is on the right. The anode
      (positive terminal) is in the base of the tube at bottom.
    * Cathode rays travel from the cathode at the rear of the tube, striking
      the glass front, making it glow green by fluorescence. A metal cross in
      the tube casts a shadow, demonstrating that the rays travel in straight
      lines.
    * A magnet creates a horizontal magnetic field through the neck of the
      tube, bending the rays up, so the shadow of the cross is higher.
    * When the magnet is reversed, it bends the rays down, so the shadow is
      lower. The pink glow is caused by cathode rays striking residual gas
      atoms in the tube.
***** History[edit] *****
After the 1654 invention of the vacuum_pump by Otto_von_Guericke, physicists
began to experiment with passing high voltage electricity through rarefied_air.
In 1705, it was noted that electrostatic_generator sparks travel a longer
distance through low pressure air than through atmospheric pressure air.
**** Gas discharge tubes[edit] ****
Glow_discharge in a low-pressure tube caused by electric current.
In 1838, Michael_Faraday applied a high voltage between two metal electrodes at
either end of a glass tube that had been partially evacuated of air, and
noticed a strange light arc with its beginning at the cathode (positive
electrode) and its end are at the anode (negative electrode).[4] In 1857,
German physicist and glassblower Heinrich_Geissler sucked even more air out
with an improved pump, to a pressure of around 10â3 atm and found that,
instead of an arc, a glow filled the tube. The voltage applied between the two
electrodes of the tubes, generated by an induction_coil, was anywhere between a
few kilovolts and 100 kV. These were called Geissler_tubes, similar to today's
neon_signs.
The explanation of these effects was that the high voltage accelerated free
electrons and electrically charged atoms (ions) naturally present in the air of
the tube.[citation_needed] At low pressure, there was enough space between the
gas atoms that the electrons could accelerate to high enough speeds that when
they struck an atom they knocked electrons off of it, creating more positive
ions and free electrons, which went on to create more ions and electrons in a
chain reaction,[citation_needed] known as a glow_discharge. The positive ions
were attracted to the cathode and when they struck it knocked more electrons
out of it, which were attracted toward the anode. Thus the ionized air was
electrically conductive and an electric current flowed through the tube.
Geissler tubes had enough air in them that the electrons could only travel a
tiny distance before colliding with an atom. The electrons in these tubes moved
in a slow diffusion process, never gaining much speed, so these tubes didn't
produce cathode rays. Instead, they produced a colorful glow_discharge (as in a
modern neon_light), caused when the electrons struck gas atoms, exciting their
orbital electrons to higher energy levels. The electrons released this energy
as light. This process is called fluorescence.
**** Cathode rays[edit] ****
A Crookes tube. The cathode rays travel in straight lines from the cathode
(left) and strike the right wall of the tube, making it glow by fluorescence.
By the 1870s, British physicist William_Crookes and others were able to
evacuate tubes to a lower pressure, below 10â6 atm. These were called Crookes
tubes. Faraday had been the first to notice a dark space just in front of the
cathode, where there was no luminescence. This came to be called the "cathode
dark space", "Faraday dark space" or "Crookes dark space". Crookes found that
as he pumped more air out of the tubes, the Faraday dark space spread down the
tube from the cathode toward the anode, until the tube was totally dark. But at
the anode (positive) end of the tube, the glass of the tube itself began to
glow.
What was happening was that as more air was pumped from the tube, the electrons
knocked out of the cathode when positive ions struck it could travel farther,
on average, before they struck a gas atom. By the time the tube was dark, most
of the electrons could travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode
end of the tube without a collision. With no obstructions, these low mass
particles were accelerated to high velocities by the voltage between the
electrodes. These were the cathode rays.
When they reached the anode end of the tube, they were traveling so fast that,
although they were attracted to it, they often flew past the anode and struck
the back wall of the tube. When they struck atoms in the glass wall, they
excited their orbital electrons to higher energy_levels. When the electrons
returned to their original energy level, they released the energy as light,
causing the glass to fluoresce, usually a greenish or bluish color. Later
researchers painted the inside back wall with fluorescent chemicals such as
zinc_sulfide, to make the glow more visible.
Cathode rays themselves are invisible, but this accidental fluorescence allowed
researchers to notice that objects in the tube in front of the cathode, such as
the anode, cast sharp-edged shadows on the glowing back wall. In 1869, German
physicist Johann_Hittorf was first to realize that something must be traveling
in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadows. Eugen_Goldstein named
them cathode rays (German kathodenstrahlen).
**** Discovery of the electron[edit] ****
At this time, atoms were the smallest particles known, and were believed to be
indivisible. What carried electric currents was a mystery. During the last
quarter of the 19th century, many historic experiments were done with Crookes
tubes to determine what cathode rays were. There were two theories. Crookes and
Arthur_Schuster believed they were particles of "radiant matter," that is,
electrically charged atoms. German scientists Eilhard Wiedemann, Heinrich_Hertz
and Goldstein believed they were "aether waves", some new form of
electromagnetic_radiation, and were separate from what carried the electric
current through the tube.
The debate was resolved in 1897 when J._J._Thomson measured the mass of cathode
rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter
than the lightest atom, hydrogen. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new
particle, the first subatomic particle to be discovered, which he originally
called "corpuscle" but was later named electron, after particles postulated by
George_Johnstone_Stoney in 1874. He also showed they were identical with
particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials.[5] It was
quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry electric currents in
metal wires, and carry the negative electric charge of the atom.
Thomson was given the 1906 Nobel_prize for physics for this work. Philipp
Lenard also contributed a great deal to cathode ray theory, winning the Nobel
prize for physics in 1905 for his research on cathode rays and their
properties.
**** Vacuum tubes[edit] ****
The gas ionization (or cold_cathode) method of producing cathode rays used in
Crookes tubes was unreliable, because it depended on the pressure of the
residual air in the tube. Over time, the air was absorbed by the walls of the
tube, and it stopped working.
A more reliable and controllable method of producing cathode rays was
investigated by Hittorf and Goldstein,[citation_needed] and rediscovered by
Thomas_Edison in 1880. A cathode made of a wire filament heated red hot by a
separate current passing through it would release electrons into the tube by a
process called thermionic_emission. The first true electronic vacuum_tubes,
invented in 1904 by John_Ambrose_Fleming, used this hot_cathode technique, and
they superseded Crookes tubes. These tubes didn't need gas in them to work, so
they were evacuated to a lower pressure, around 10â9 atm (10â4 Pa). The
ionization method of creating cathode rays used in Crookes tubes is today only
used in a few specialized gas_discharge_tubes such as krytrons.
In 1906, Lee_De_Forest found that a small voltage on a grid of metal wires
could control a much larger current in a beam of cathode rays passing through a
vacuum tube. His invention, called the triode, was the first device that could
amplify electric signals, and revolutionized electrical technology, creating
the new field of electronics. Vacuum tubes made radio and television
broadcasting possible, as well as radar, talking movies, audio recording, and
long distance telephone service, and were the foundation of consumer electronic
devices until the 1960s, when the transistor brought the era of vacuum tubes to
a close.
Cathode rays are now usually called electron beams. The technology of
manipulating electron beams pioneered in these early tubes was applied
practically in the design of vacuum tubes, particularly in the invention of the
cathode_ray_tube (CRT) by Ferdinand_Braun in 1897, which was used in television
sets and oscilloscopes. Today, electron beams are employed in sophisticated
devices such as electron_microscopes, electron_beam_lithography and particle
accelerators.
***** Properties[edit] *****
Like a wave, cathode rays travel in straight lines, and produce a shadow when
obstructed by objects. Ernest_Rutherford demonstrated that rays could pass
through thin metal foils, behavior expected of a particle. These conflicting
properties caused disruptions when trying to classify it as a wave or particle.
Crookes insisted it was a particle, while Hertz maintained it was a wave. The
debate was resolved when an electric field was used to deflect the rays by J.
J. Thomson. This was evidence that the beams were composed of particles because
scientists knew it was impossible to deflect electromagnetic waves with an
electric field. These can also create mechanical effects, fluorescence, etc.
Louis_de_Broglie later (1924) showed in his doctoral dissertation that
electrons are in fact much like photons in the respect that they act both as
waves and as particles in a dual_manner as Einstein had shown earlier for
light. The wave-like behaviour of cathode rays was later directly demonstrated
using a crystal lattice by Davisson_and_Germer in 1927.
