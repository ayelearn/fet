Device which emits light via optical amplification
A laser beam used for welding
Red (660 & 635 nm), green (532 & 520 nm) and blue-violet (445 & 405 nm) lasers
A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical_amplification
based on the stimulated_emission of electromagnetic_radiation. The term "laser"
originated as an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated emission of
radiation".[1][2] The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore_H._Maiman at
Hughes_Research_Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles_Hard_Townes
and Arthur_Leonard_Schawlow.
A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light coherently.
Spatial_coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling
applications such as laser_cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also
allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling
applications such as laser_pointers and lidar. Lasers can also have high
temporal_coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow
spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Alternatively, temporal
coherence can be used to produce pulses of light with a broad spectrum but
durations as short as a femtosecond ("ultrashort_pulses").
Lasers are used in optical_disk_drives, laser_printers, barcode_scanners, DNA
sequencing_instruments, fiber-optic and free-space_optical_communication, laser
surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, military and law
enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring_range and speed, and in
laser_lighting_displays for entertainment. They have been used for car
headlamps on luxury cars, by using a blue laser and a phosphor to produce
highly directional white light.[3][4][5][6]

***** Fundamentals *****
Modern telescopes use laser technologies to compensate for the blurring effect
of the Earth's_atmosphere.[7]
Lasers are distinguished from other light sources by their coherence. Spatial
coherence is typically expressed through the output being a narrow beam, which
is diffraction-limited. Laser beams can be focused to very tiny spots,
achieving a very high irradiance, or they can have very low divergence in order
to concentrate their power at a great distance. Temporal (or longitudinal)
coherence implies a polarized wave at a single frequency, whose phase is
correlated over a relatively great distance (the coherence_length) along the
beam.[8] A beam produced by a thermal or other incoherent light source has an
instantaneous amplitude and phase that vary randomly with respect to time and
position, thus having a short coherence length.
Lasers are characterized according to their wavelength in a vacuum. Most
"single wavelength" lasers actually produce radiation in several modes with
slightly different wavelengths. Although temporal coherence implies
monochromaticity, there are lasers that emit a broad spectrum of light or emit
different wavelengths of light simultaneously. Some lasers are not single
spatial mode and have light beams that diverge more than is required by the
diffraction_limit. All such devices are classified as "lasers" based on their
method of producing light, i.e., stimulated emission. Lasers are employed where
light of the required spatial or temporal coherence can not be produced using
simpler technologies.
**** Terminology ****
Laser beams in fog, reflected on a car windshield
The word laser started as an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation". In this usage, the term "light" includes
electromagnetic radiation of any frequency, not only visible_light, hence the
terms infrared laser, ultraviolet laser, X-ray_laser and gamma-ray_laser.
Because the microwave predecessor of the laser, the maser, was developed first,
devices of this sort operating at microwave and radio_frequencies are referred
to as "masers" rather than "microwave lasers" or "radio lasers". In the early
technical literature, especially at Bell_Telephone_Laboratories, the laser was
called an optical maser; this term is now obsolete.[9]
A laser that produces light by itself is technically an optical oscillator
rather than an optical_amplifier as suggested by the acronym. It has been
humorously noted that the acronym LOSER, for "light oscillation by stimulated
emission of radiation", would have been more correct.[10] With the widespread
use of the original acronym as a common noun, optical amplifiers have come to
be referred to as "laser amplifiers", notwithstanding the apparent redundancy
in that designation.
The back-formed verb to lase is frequently used in the field, meaning "to
produce laser light,"[11] especially in reference to the gain medium of a
laser; when a laser is operating it is said to be "lasing." Further use of the
words laser and maser in an extended sense, not referring to laser technology
or devices, can be seen in usages such as astrophysical_maser and atom_laser.
***** Design *****
Main article: Laser_construction
Components of a typical laser:
   1. Gain medium
   2. Laser pumping energy
   3. High reflector
   4. Output_coupler
   5. Laser beam
A laser consists of a gain_medium, a mechanism to energize it, and something to
provide optical feedback.[12] The gain medium is a material with properties
that allow it to amplify light by way of stimulated emission. Light of a
specific wavelength that passes through the gain medium is amplified (increases
in power).
For the gain medium to amplify light, it needs to be supplied with energy in a
process called pumping. The energy is typically supplied as an electric current
or as light at a different wavelength. Pump light may be provided by a flash
lamp or by another laser.
The most common type of laser uses feedback from an optical_cavityâa pair of
mirrors on either end of the gain medium. Light bounces back and forth between
the mirrors, passing through the gain medium and being amplified each time.
Typically one of the two mirrors, the output_coupler, is partially transparent.
Some of the light escapes through this mirror. Depending on the design of the
cavity (whether the mirrors are flat or curved), the light coming out of the
laser may spread out or form a narrow beam. In analogy to electronic
oscillators, this device is sometimes called a laser oscillator.
Most practical lasers contain additional elements that affect properties of the
emitted light, such as the polarization, wavelength, and shape of the beam.

**** Stimulated emission ****
Main article: Stimulated_emission
[File:Laser, quantum principle.ogv]Play_media
Animation explaining stimulated emission and the laser principle
In the classical_view, the energy of an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is
larger for orbits further from the nucleus of an atom. However, quantum
mechanical effects force electrons to take on discrete positions in orbitals.
Thus, electrons are found in specific energy levels of an atom, two of which
are shown below:
[Stimulated_Emission.svg]
When an electron absorbs energy either from light (photons) or heat (phonons),
it receives that incident quantum of energy. But transitions are only allowed
in between discrete energy levels such as the two shown above. This leads to
emission_lines and absorption_lines.
When an electron is excited from a lower to a higher energy level, it will not
stay that way forever. An electron in an excited state may decay to a lower
energy state which is not occupied, according to a particular time constant
characterizing that transition. When such an electron decays without external
influence, emitting a photon, that is called "spontaneous_emission". The phase
associated with the photon that is emitted is random. A material with many
atoms in such an excited state may thus result in radiation which is very
spectrally limited (centered around one wavelength of light), but the
individual photons would have no common phase relationship and would emanate in
random directions. This is the mechanism of fluorescence and thermal_emission.
An external electromagnetic field at a frequency associated with a transition
can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom. As the electron in the
atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a
dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and
which acts like a small electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a
characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this
frequency, the probability of the atom entering this transition state is
greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states
is enhanced beyond that due to spontaneous emission. Such a transition to the
higher state is called absorption, and it destroys an incident photon (the
photon's energy goes into powering the increased energy of the higher state). A
transition from the higher to a lower energy state, however, produces an
additional photon; this is the process of stimulated emission.
**** Gain medium and cavity ****
A heliumâneon_laser demonstration. The glow running through the center of the
tube is an electric discharge. This glowing plasma is the gain_medium for the
laser. The laser produces a tiny, intense spot on the screen to the right. The
center of the spot appears white because the image is overexposed there.
Spectrum of a heliumâneon laser. The actual bandwidth is much narrower than
shown; the spectrum is limited by the measuring apparatus.
The gain medium is put into an excited_state by an external source of energy.
In most lasers this medium consists of a population of atoms which have been
excited into such a state by means of an outside light source, or an electrical
field which supplies energy for atoms to absorb and be transformed into their
excited states.
The gain medium of a laser is normally a material of controlled purity, size,
concentration, and shape, which amplifies the beam by the process of stimulated
emission described above. This material can be of any state: gas, liquid,
solid, or plasma. The gain medium absorbs pump energy, which raises some
electrons into higher-energy ("excited") quantum_states. Particles can interact
with light by either absorbing or emitting photons. Emission can be spontaneous
or stimulated. In the latter case, the photon is emitted in the same direction
as the light that is passing by. When the number of particles in one excited
state exceeds the number of particles in some lower-energy state, population
inversion is achieved and the amount of stimulated emission due to light that
passes through is larger than the amount of absorption. Hence, the light is
amplified. By itself, this makes an optical_amplifier. When an optical
amplifier is placed inside a resonant optical cavity, one obtains a laser
oscillator.[13]
In a few situations it is possible to obtain lasing with only a single pass of
EM radiation through the gain medium, and this produces a laser beam without
any need for a resonant or reflective cavity (see for example nitrogen_laser).
[14] Thus, reflection in a resonant cavity is usually required for a laser, but
is not absolutely necessary.
The optical resonator is sometimes referred to as an "optical cavity", but this
is a misnomer: lasers use open resonators as opposed to the literal cavity that
would be employed at microwave frequencies in a maser. The resonator typically
consists of two mirrors between which a coherent beam of light travels in both
directions, reflecting back on itself so that an average photon will pass
through the gain medium repeatedly before it is emitted from the output
aperture or lost to diffraction or absorption. If the gain (amplification) in
the medium is larger than the resonator losses, then the power of the
recirculating light can rise exponentially. But each stimulated emission event
returns an atom from its excited state to the ground state, reducing the gain
of the medium. With increasing beam power the net gain (gain minus loss)
reduces to unity and the gain medium is said to be saturated. In a continuous
wave (CW) laser, the balance of pump power against gain saturation and cavity
losses produces an equilibrium value of the laser power inside the cavity; this
equilibrium determines the operating point of the laser. If the applied pump
power is too small, the gain will never be sufficient to overcome the cavity
losses, and laser light will not be produced. The minimum pump power needed to
begin laser action is called the lasing_threshold. The gain medium will amplify
any photons passing through it, regardless of direction; but only the photons
in a spatial_mode supported by the resonator will pass more than once through
the medium and receive substantial amplification.
**** The light emitted ****
In most lasers, lasing begins with stimulated emission amplifying random
spontaneously emitted photons present in the gain medium. Stimulated emission
produces light that matches the input signal in wavelength, phase, and
polarization. This, combined with the filtering effect of the optical resonator
gives laser light its characteristic coherence, and may give it uniform
polarization and monochromaticity, depending on the resonator's design. Some
lasers use a separate injection_seeder to start the process off with a beam
that is already highly coherent. This can produce beams with a narrower
spectrum than would otherwise be possible.
Many lasers produce a beam that can be approximated as a Gaussian_beam; such
beams have the minimum divergence possible for a given beam diameter. Some
lasers, particularly high-power ones, produce multimode beams, with the
transverse_modes often approximated using HermiteâGaussian or Laguerre-
Gaussian functions. Some high power lasers use a flat-topped profile known as a
"tophat_beam". Unstable laser resonators (not used in most lasers) produce
fractal-shaped beams.[15] Specialized optical systems can produce more complex
beam geometries, such as Bessel_beams and optical_vortexes.
Near the "waist" (or focal_region) of a laser beam, it is highly collimated:
the wavefronts are planar, normal to the direction of propagation, with no beam
divergence at that point. However, due to diffraction, that can only remain
true well within the Rayleigh_range. The beam of a single transverse mode
(gaussian beam) laser eventually diverges at an angle which varies inversely
with the beam diameter, as required by diffraction theory. Thus, the "pencil
beam" directly generated by a common heliumâneon_laser would spread out to a
size of perhaps 500 kilometers when shone on the Moon (from the distance of the
earth). On the other hand, the light from a semiconductor_laser typically exits
the tiny crystal with a large divergence: up to 50Â°. However even such a
divergent beam can be transformed into a similarly collimated beam by means of
a lens system, as is always included, for instance, in a laser_pointer whose
light originates from a laser_diode. That is possible due to the light being of
a single spatial mode. This unique property of laser light, spatial_coherence,
cannot be replicated using standard light sources (except by discarding most of
the light) as can be appreciated by comparing the beam from a flashlight
(torch) or spotlight to that of almost any laser.
A laser_beam_profiler is used to measure the intensity profile, width, and
divergence of laser beams.
Diffuse_reflection of a laser beam from a matte surface produces a speckle
pattern with interesting properties.
**** Quantum vs. classical emission processes ****
The mechanism of producing radiation in a laser relies on stimulated_emission,
where energy is extracted from a transition in an atom or molecule. This is a
quantum phenomenon discovered by Einstein who derived the relationship between
the A_coefficient describing spontaneous emission and the B_coefficient which
applies to absorption and stimulated emission. However, in the case of the free
electron_laser, atomic energy levels are not involved; it appears that the
operation of this rather exotic device can be explained without reference to
quantum_mechanics.
***** Continuous and pulsed modes of operation *****

A laser can be classified as operating in either continuous or pulsed mode,
depending on whether the power output is essentially continuous over time or
whether its output takes the form of pulses of light on one or another time
scale. Of course even a laser whose output is normally continuous can be
intentionally turned on and off at some rate in order to create pulses of
light. When the modulation rate is on time scales much slower than the cavity
lifetime and the time period over which energy can be stored in the lasing
medium or pumping mechanism, then it is still classified as a "modulated" or
"pulsed" continuous wave laser. Most laser diodes used in communication systems
fall in that category.
**** Continuous wave operation ****
Some applications of lasers depend on a beam whose output power is constant
over time. Such a laser is known as continuous_wave (CW). Many types of lasers
can be made to operate in continuous wave mode to satisfy such an application.
Many of these lasers actually lase in several longitudinal modes at the same
time, and beats between the slightly different optical frequencies of those
oscillations will, in fact, produce amplitude variations on time scales shorter
than the round-trip time (the reciprocal of the frequency_spacing between
modes), typically a few nanoseconds or less. In most cases, these lasers are
still termed "continuous wave" as their output power is steady when averaged
over any longer time periods, with the very high-frequency power variations
having little or no impact in the intended application. (However, the term is
not applied to mode-locked lasers, where the intention is to create very short
pulses at the rate of the round-trip time.)
For continuous wave operation, it is required for the population inversion of
the gain medium to be continually replenished by a steady pump source. In some
lasing media, this is impossible. In some other lasers, it would require
pumping the laser at a very high continuous power level which would be
impractical or destroy the laser by producing excessive heat. Such lasers
cannot be run in CW mode.
**** Pulsed operation ****
Pulsed operation of lasers refers to any laser not classified as continuous
wave, so that the optical power appears in pulses of some duration at some
repetition rate. This encompasses a wide range of technologies addressing a
number of different motivations. Some lasers are pulsed simply because they
cannot be run in continuous mode.
In other cases, the application requires the production of pulses having as
large an energy as possible. Since the pulse energy is equal to the average
power divided by the repetition rate, this goal can sometimes be satisfied by
lowering the rate of pulses so that more energy can be built up in between
pulses. In laser_ablation, for example, a small volume of material at the
surface of a work piece can be evaporated if it is heated in a very short time,
while supplying the energy gradually would allow for the heat to be absorbed
into the bulk of the piece, never attaining a sufficiently high temperature at
a particular point.
Other applications rely on the peak pulse power (rather than the energy in the
pulse), especially in order to obtain nonlinear_optical effects. For a given
pulse energy, this requires creating pulses of the shortest possible duration
utilizing techniques such as Q-switching.
The optical bandwidth of a pulse cannot be narrower than the reciprocal of the
pulse width. In the case of extremely short pulses, that implies lasing over a
considerable bandwidth, quite contrary to the very narrow bandwidths typical of
CW lasers. The lasing medium in some dye lasers and vibronic solid-state lasers
produces optical gain over a wide bandwidth, making a laser possible which can
thus generate pulses of light as short as a few femtoseconds (10â15 s).
*** Q-switching ***
Main article: Q-switching
In a Q-switched laser, the population inversion is allowed to build up by
introducing loss inside the resonator which exceeds the gain of the medium;
this can also be described as a reduction of the quality factor or 'Q' of the
cavity. Then, after the pump energy stored in the laser medium has approached
the maximum possible level, the introduced loss mechanism (often an electro- or
acousto-optical element) is rapidly removed (or that occurs by itself in a
passive device), allowing lasing to begin which rapidly obtains the stored
energy in the gain medium. This results in a short pulse incorporating that
energy, and thus a high peak power.
*** Mode-locking ***
Main article: Mode-locking
A mode-locked laser is capable of emitting extremely short pulses on the order
of tens of picoseconds down to less than 10 femtoseconds. These pulses will
repeat at the round trip time, that is, the time that it takes light to
complete one round trip between the mirrors comprising the resonator. Due to
the Fourier_limit (also known as energy-time uncertainty), a pulse of such
short temporal length has a spectrum spread over a considerable bandwidth. Thus
such a gain medium must have a gain bandwidth sufficiently broad to amplify
those frequencies. An example of a suitable material is titanium-doped,
artificially grown sapphire (Ti:sapphire) which has a very wide gain bandwidth
and can thus produce pulses of only a few femtoseconds duration.
Such mode-locked lasers are a most versatile tool for researching processes
occurring on extremely short time scales (known as femtosecond physics,
femtosecond_chemistry and ultrafast_science), for maximizing the effect of
nonlinearity in optical materials (e.g. in second-harmonic_generation,
parametric_down-conversion, optical_parametric_oscillators and the like). Due
to the large peak power and the ability to generate phase-stabilized trains of
ultrafast laser pulses, mode-locking ultrafast lasers underpin precision
metrology and spectroscopy applications.[16]
*** Pulsed pumping ***
Another method of achieving pulsed laser operation is to pump the laser
material with a source that is itself pulsed, either through electronic
charging in the case of flash lamps, or another laser which is already pulsed.
Pulsed pumping was historically used with dye lasers where the inverted
population lifetime of a dye molecule was so short that a high energy, fast
pump was needed. The way to overcome this problem was to charge up large
capacitors which are then switched to discharge through flashlamps, producing
an intense flash. Pulsed pumping is also required for three-level lasers in
which the lower energy level rapidly becomes highly populated preventing
further lasing until those atoms relax to the ground state. These lasers, such
as the excimer laser and the copper vapor laser, can never be operated in CW
mode.
***** History *****
**** Foundations ****
In 1917, Albert_Einstein established the theoretical foundations for the laser
and the maser in the paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung (On the Quantum
Theory of Radiation) via a re-derivation of Max_Planck's law of radiation,
conceptually based upon probability coefficients (Einstein_coefficients) for
the absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission of
electromagnetic radiation.[17] In 1928, Rudolf_W._Ladenburg confirmed the
existence of the phenomena of stimulated emission and negative absorption.[18]
In 1939, Valentin A. Fabrikant predicted the use of stimulated emission to
amplify "short" waves.[19] In 1947, Willis_E._Lamb and R.C. Retherford found
apparent stimulated emission in hydrogen spectra and effected the first
demonstration of stimulated emission.[18] In 1950, Alfred_Kastler (Nobel Prize
for Physics 1966) proposed the method of optical_pumping, experimentally
confirmed, two years later, by Brossel, Kastler, and Winter.[20]
**** Maser ****
Main article: Maser
Aleksandr_Prokhorov
In 1951, Joseph_Weber submitted a paper on using stimulated emissions to make a
microwave amplifier to the June 1952 Institute of Radio Engineers Vacuum Tube
Research Conference at Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.[21] After this presentation,
RCA asked Weber to give a seminar on this idea, and Charles_Hard_Townes asked
him for a copy of the paper.[22]
In 1953, Charles Hard Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and Herbert
J. Zeiger produced the first microwave amplifier, a device operating on similar
principles to the laser, but amplifying microwave radiation rather than
infrared or visible radiation. Townes's maser was incapable of continuous
output.[23] Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Nikolay_Basov and Aleksandr
Prokhorov were independently working on the quantum_oscillator and solved the
problem of continuous-output systems by using more than two energy levels.
These gain media could release stimulated_emissions between an excited state
and a lower excited state, not the ground state, facilitating the maintenance
of a population_inversion. In 1955, Prokhorov and Basov suggested optical
pumping of a multi-level system as a method for obtaining the population
inversion, later a main method of laser pumping.
Townes reports that several eminent physicistsâamong them Niels_Bohr, John
von_Neumann, and Llewellyn_Thomasâargued the maser violated Heisenberg's
uncertainty_principle and hence could not work. Others such as Isidor_Rabi and
Polykarp_Kusch expected that it would be impractical and not worth the effort.
[24] In 1964 Charles H. Townes, Nikolay Basov, and Aleksandr Prokhorov shared
the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics, "for fundamental work in the field of quantum
electronics, which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers
based on the maserâlaser principle".

In 1957, Charles_Hard_Townes and Arthur_Leonard_Schawlow, then at Bell_Labs,
began a serious study of the infrared laser. As ideas developed, they abandoned
infrared radiation to instead concentrate upon visible_light. The concept
originally was called an "optical maser". In 1958, Bell Labs filed a patent
application for their proposed optical maser; and Schawlow and Townes submitted
a manuscript of their theoretical calculations to the Physical_Review,
published that year in Volume 112, Issue No. 6.
LASER notebook: First page of the notebook wherein Gordon_Gould coined the
LASER acronym, and described the elements for constructing the device.
Simultaneously, at Columbia_University, graduate student Gordon_Gould was
working on a doctoral_thesis about the energy levels of excited thallium. When
Gould and Townes met, they spoke of radiation emission, as a general subject;
afterwards, in November 1957, Gould noted his ideas for a "laser", including
using an open resonator (later an essential laser-device component). Moreover,
in 1958, Prokhorov independently proposed using an open resonator, the first
published appearance (in the USSR) of this idea. Elsewhere, in the U.S.,
Schawlow and Townes had agreed to an open-resonator laser design â apparently
unaware of Prokhorov's publications and Gould's unpublished laser work.
At a conference in 1959, Gordon Gould published the term LASER in the paper The
LASER, Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.[1][10] Gould's
linguistic intention was using the "-aser" word particle as a suffix â to
accurately denote the spectrum of the light emitted by the LASER device; thus
x-rays: xaser, ultraviolet: uvaser, et cetera; none established itself as a
discrete term, although "raser" was briefly popular for denoting radio-
frequency-emitting devices.
Gould's notes included possible applications for a laser, such as spectrometry,
interferometry, radar, and nuclear_fusion. He continued developing the idea,
and filed a patent_application in April 1959. The U.S._Patent_Office denied his
application, and awarded a patent to Bell_Labs, in 1960. That provoked a
twenty-eight-year lawsuit, featuring scientific prestige and money as the
stakes. Gould won his first minor patent in 1977, yet it was not until 1987
that he won the first significant patent lawsuit victory, when a Federal judge
ordered the U.S. Patent Office to issue patents to Gould for the optically
pumped and the gas_discharge laser devices. The question of just how to assign
credit for inventing the laser remains unresolved by historians.[25]
On May 16, 1960, Theodore_H._Maiman operated the first functioning laser[26]
[27] at Hughes_Research_Laboratories, Malibu, California, ahead of several
research teams, including those of Townes, at Columbia_University, Arthur
Schawlow, at Bell_Labs,[28] and Gould, at the TRG (Technical Research Group)
company. Maiman's functional laser used a flashlamp-pumped synthetic ruby
crystal to produce red laser light at 694 nanometers wavelength. The device was
only capable of pulsed operation, due to its three-level pumping design scheme.
Later that year, the Iranian physicist Ali_Javan, and William_R._Bennett, and
Donald_Herriott, constructed the first gas_laser, using helium and neon that
was capable of continuous operation in the infrared (U.S. Patent 3,149,290);
later, Javan received the Albert_Einstein_Award in 1993. Basov and Javan
proposed the semiconductor laser_diode concept. In 1962, Robert_N._Hall
demonstrated the first laser diode device, which was made of gallium_arsenide
and emitted in the near-infrared band of the spectrum at 850 nm. Later that
year, Nick_Holonyak, Jr. demonstrated the first semiconductor laser with a
visible emission. This first semiconductor laser could only be used in pulsed-
beam operation, and when cooled to liquid_nitrogen temperatures (77 K). In
1970, Zhores_Alferov, in the USSR, and Izuo Hayashi and Morton Panish of Bell
Telephone_Laboratories also independently developed room-temperature,
continual-operation diode lasers, using the heterojunction structure.
**** Recent innovations ****
Graph showing the history of maximum laser pulse intensity throughout the past
40 years.
Since the early period of laser history, laser research has produced a variety
of improved and specialized laser types, optimized for different performance
goals, including:
    * new wavelength bands
    * maximum average output power
    * maximum peak pulse energy
    * maximum peak pulse power
    * minimum output pulse duration
    * minimum linewidth
    * maximum power efficiency
    * minimum cost
and this research continues to this day.
In 2017, researchers at TU_Delft demonstrated an AC_Josephson_junction
microwave laser.[29] Since the laser operates in the superconducting regime, it
is more stable than other semiconductor-based lasers. The device has potential
for applications in quantum_computing.[30] In 2017, researchers at TU_Munich
demonstrated the smallest mode_locking laser capable of emitting pairs of
phase-locked picosecond laser pulses with a repetition frequency up to
200âGHz.[16]
In 2017, researchers from the Physikalisch-Technische_Bundesanstalt_(PTB),
together with US researchers from JILA, a joint institute of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University_of_Colorado
Boulder, established a new world record by developing an erbium-doped fiber
laser with a linewidth of only 10 millihertz.[31][32]

Wavelengths of commercially available lasers. Laser types with distinct laser
lines are shown above the wavelength bar, while below are shown lasers that can
emit in a wavelength range. The color codifies the type of laser material (see
the figure description for more details).
**** Gas lasers ****
Main article: Gas_laser
Following the invention of the HeNe gas laser, many other gas discharges have
been found to amplify light coherently. Gas lasers using many different gases
have been built and used for many purposes. The heliumâneon_laser (HeNe) is
able to operate at a number of different wavelengths, however the vast majority
are engineered to lase at 633 nm; these relatively low cost but highly coherent
lasers are extremely common in optical research and educational laboratories.
Commercial carbon_dioxide_(CO2)_lasers can emit many hundreds of watts in a
single spatial mode which can be concentrated into a tiny spot. This emission
is in the thermal infrared at 10.6 Âµm; such lasers are regularly used in
industry for cutting and welding. The efficiency of a CO2 laser is unusually
high: over 30%.[33] Argon-ion lasers can operate at a number of lasing
transitions between 351 and 528.7 nm. Depending on the optical design one or
more of these transitions can be lasing simultaneously; the most commonly used
lines are 458 nm, 488 nm and 514.5 nm. A nitrogen transverse_electrical
discharge_in_gas_at_atmospheric_pressure (TEA) laser is an inexpensive gas
laser, often home-built by hobbyists, which produces rather incoherent UV light
at 337.1 nm.[34] Metal ion lasers are gas lasers that generate deep_ultraviolet
wavelengths. Helium-silver (HeAg) 224 nm and neon-copper (NeCu) 248 nm are two
examples. Like all low-pressure gas lasers, the gain media of these lasers have
quite narrow oscillation linewidths, less than 3 GHz (0.5 picometers),[35]
making them candidates for use in fluorescence suppressed Raman_spectroscopy.
*** Chemical lasers ***
Chemical_lasers are powered by a chemical reaction permitting a large amount of
energy to be released quickly. Such very high power lasers are especially of
interest to the military, however continuous wave chemical lasers at very high
power levels, fed by streams of gasses, have been developed and have some
industrial applications. As examples, in the hydrogen_fluoride_laser
(2700â2900 nm) and the deuterium_fluoride_laser (3800 nm) the reaction is the
combination of hydrogen or deuterium gas with combustion products of ethylene
in nitrogen_trifluoride.
*** Excimer lasers ***
Excimer_lasers are a special sort of gas laser powered by an electric discharge
in which the lasing medium is an excimer, or more precisely an exciplex in
existing designs. These are molecules which can only exist with one atom in an
excited_electronic_state. Once the molecule transfers its excitation energy to
a photon, its atoms are no longer bound to each other and the molecule
disintegrates. This drastically reduces the population of the lower energy
state thus greatly facilitating a population inversion. Excimers currently used
are all noble_gas_compounds; noble gasses are chemically inert and can only
form compounds while in an excited state. Excimer lasers typically operate at
ultraviolet wavelengths with major applications including semiconductor
photolithography and LASIK eye surgery. Commonly used excimer molecules include
ArF (emission at 193 nm), KrCl (222 nm), KrF (248 nm), XeCl (308 nm), and XeF
(351 nm).[36] The molecular fluorine laser, emitting at 157 nm in the vacuum
ultraviolet is sometimes referred to as an excimer laser, however this appears
to be a misnomer inasmuch as F2 is a stable compound.
**** Solid-state lasers ****
A 50 W FASOR, based on a Nd:YAG laser, used at the Starfire_Optical_Range.
Solid-state_lasers use a crystalline or glass rod which is "doped" with ions
that provide the required energy states. For example, the first working laser
was a ruby_laser, made from ruby (chromium-doped corundum). The population
inversion is actually maintained in the dopant. These materials are pumped
optically using a shorter wavelength than the lasing wavelength, often from a
flashtube or from another laser. The usage of the term "solid-state" in laser
physics is narrower than in typical use. Semiconductor lasers (laser diodes)
are typically not referred to as solid-state lasers.
Neodymium is a common dopant in various solid-state laser crystals, including
yttrium_orthovanadate (Nd:YVO4), yttrium_lithium_fluoride (Nd:YLF) and yttrium
aluminium_garnet (Nd:YAG). All these lasers can produce high powers in the
infrared spectrum at 1064 nm. They are used for cutting, welding and marking of
metals and other materials, and also in spectroscopy and for pumping dye
lasers. These lasers are also commonly frequency_doubled, tripled or quadrupled
to produce 532 nm (green, visible), 355 nm and 266 nm (UV) beams, respectively.
Frequency-doubled diode-pumped_solid-state (DPSS) lasers are used to make
bright green laser pointers.
Ytterbium, holmium, thulium, and erbium are other common "dopants" in solid-
state lasers.[37] Ytterbium is used in crystals such as Yb:YAG, Yb:KGW, Yb:KYW,
Yb:SYS, Yb:BOYS, Yb:CaF2, typically operating around 1020â1050 nm. They are
potentially very efficient and high powered due to a small quantum defect.
Extremely high powers in ultrashort pulses can be achieved with Yb:YAG.
Holmium-doped YAG crystals emit at 2097 nm and form an efficient laser
operating at infrared wavelengths strongly absorbed by water-bearing tissues.
The Ho-YAG is usually operated in a pulsed mode, and passed through optical
fiber surgical devices to resurface joints, remove rot from teeth, vaporize
cancers, and pulverize kidney and gall stones.
Titanium-doped sapphire (Ti:sapphire) produces a highly tunable infrared laser,
commonly used for spectroscopy. It is also notable for use as a mode-locked
laser producing ultrashort_pulses of extremely high peak power.
Thermal limitations in solid-state lasers arise from unconverted pump power
that heats the medium. This heat, when coupled with a high thermo-optic
coefficient (dn/dT) can cause thermal lensing and reduce the quantum
efficiency. Diode-pumped thin disk_lasers overcome these issues by having a
gain medium that is much thinner than the diameter of the pump beam. This
allows for a more uniform temperature in the material. Thin disk lasers have
been shown to produce beams of up to one kilowatt.[38]
**** Fiber lasers ****
Main article: Fiber_laser
Solid-state lasers or laser amplifiers where the light is guided due to the
total_internal_reflection in a single mode optical_fiber are instead called
fiber_lasers. Guiding of light allows extremely long gain regions providing
good cooling conditions; fibers have high surface area to volume ratio which
allows efficient cooling. In addition, the fiber's waveguiding properties tend
to reduce thermal distortion of the beam. Erbium and ytterbium ions are common
active species in such lasers.
Quite often, the fiber laser is designed as a double-clad_fiber. This type of
fiber consists of a fiber core, an inner cladding and an outer cladding. The
index of the three concentric layers is chosen so that the fiber core acts as a
single-mode fiber for the laser emission while the outer cladding acts as a
highly multimode core for the pump laser. This lets the pump propagate a large
amount of power into and through the active inner core region, while still
having a high numerical aperture (NA) to have easy launching conditions.
Pump light can be used more efficiently by creating a fiber_disk_laser, or a
stack of such lasers.
Fiber lasers have a fundamental limit in that the intensity of the light in the
fiber cannot be so high that optical nonlinearities induced by the local
electric field strength can become dominant and prevent laser operation and/or
lead to the material destruction of the fiber. This effect is called
photodarkening. In bulk laser materials, the cooling is not so efficient, and
it is difficult to separate the effects of photodarkening from the thermal
effects, but the experiments in fibers show that the photodarkening can be
attributed to the formation of long-living color_centers.[citation_needed]
**** Photonic crystal lasers ****
Photonic crystal lasers are lasers based on nano-structures that provide the
mode confinement and the density_of_optical_states (DOS) structure required for
the feedback to take place.[clarification_needed] They are typical micrometer-
sized[dubious  – discuss] and tunable on the bands of the photonic crystals.
[39][clarification_needed]
**** Semiconductor lasers ****
Main article: Semiconductor_lasers
A 5.6 mm 'closed can' commercial laser diode, probably from a CD or DVD_player
Semiconductor lasers are diodes which are electrically pumped. Recombination of
electrons and holes created by the applied current introduces optical gain.
Reflection from the ends of the crystal form an optical resonator, although the
resonator can be external to the semiconductor in some designs.
Commercial laser_diodes emit at wavelengths from 375 nm to 3500 nm.[40] Low to
medium power laser diodes are used in laser_pointers, laser_printers and CD/DVD
players. Laser diodes are also frequently used to optically pump other lasers
with high efficiency. The highest power industrial laser diodes, with power up
to 20 kW, are used in industry for cutting and welding.[41] External-cavity
semiconductor lasers have a semiconductor active medium in a larger cavity.
These devices can generate high power outputs with good beam quality,
wavelength-tunable narrow-linewidth radiation, or ultrashort laser pulses.
In 2012, Nichia and OSRAM developed and manufactured commercial high-power
green laser diodes (515/520 nm), which compete with traditional diode-pumped
solid-state lasers.[42][43]
Vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are semiconductor lasers whose
emission direction is perpendicular to the surface of the wafer. VCSEL devices
typically have a more circular output beam than conventional laser diodes. As
of 2005, only 850 nm VCSELs are widely available, with 1300 nm VCSELs beginning
to be commercialized,[44] and 1550 nm devices an area of research. VECSELs are
external-cavity VCSELs. Quantum_cascade_lasers are semiconductor lasers that
have an active transition between energy sub-bands of an electron in a
structure containing several quantum_wells.
The development of a silicon laser is important in the field of optical
computing. Silicon is the material of choice for integrated_circuits, and so
electronic and silicon_photonic components (such as optical_interconnects)
could be fabricated on the same chip. Unfortunately, silicon is a difficult
lasing material to deal with, since it has certain properties which block
lasing. However, recently teams have produced silicon lasers through methods
such as fabricating the lasing material from silicon and other semiconductor
materials, such as indium(III)_phosphide or gallium(III)_arsenide, materials
which allow coherent light to be produced from silicon. These are called hybrid
silicon_laser. Recent developments have also shown the use of monolithically
integrated nanowire_lasers directly on silicon for optical interconnects,
paving the way for chip level applications.[45] These heterostructure nanowire
lasers capable of optical interconnects in silicon are also capable of emitting
pairs of phase-locked picosecond pulses with a repetition frequency up to
200âGHz, allowing for on-chip optical signal processing.[16] Another type is
a Raman_laser, which takes advantage of Raman_scattering to produce a laser
from materials such as silicon.
Lasing_without_maintaining_the_medium_excited_into_a_population_inversion was
demonstrated in 1992 in sodium gas and again in 1995 in rubidium gas by various
international teams.[46][47] This was accomplished by using an external maser
to induce "optical transparency" in the medium by introducing and destructively
interfering the ground electron transitions between two paths, so that the
likelihood for the ground electrons to absorb any energy has been cancelled.
**** Dye lasers ****
Close-up of a table-top dye laser based on Rhodamine_6G
Dye_lasers use an organic dye as the gain medium. The wide gain spectrum of
available dyes, or mixtures of dyes, allows these lasers to be highly tunable,
or to produce very short-duration pulses (on_the_order_of a few femtoseconds).
Although these tunable_lasers are mainly known in their liquid form,
researchers have also demonstrated narrow-linewidth tunable emission in
dispersive oscillator configurations incorporating solid-state dye gain media.
In their most prevalent form these solid_state_dye_lasers use dye-doped
polymers as laser media.
**** Free-electron lasers ****
The free-electron laser FELIX at the FOM Institute for Plasma Physics
Rijnhuizen, Nieuwegein
Free-electron_lasers, or FELs, generate coherent, high power radiation that is
widely tunable, currently ranging in wavelength from microwaves through
terahertz_radiation and infrared to the visible spectrum, to soft X-rays. They
have the widest frequency range of any laser type. While FEL beams share the
same optical traits as other lasers, such as coherent radiation, FEL operation
is quite different. Unlike gas, liquid, or solid-state lasers, which rely on
bound atomic or molecular states, FELs use a relativistic electron beam as the
lasing medium, hence the term free-electron.
**** Exotic media ****
The pursuit of a high-quantum-energy laser using transitions between isomeric
states of an atomic_nucleus has been the subject of wide-ranging academic
research since the early 1970s. Much of this is summarized in three review
articles.[48][49][50] This research has been international in scope, but mainly
based in the former Soviet Union and the United States. While many scientists
remain optimistic that a breakthrough is near, an operational gamma-ray_laser
is yet to be realized.[51]
Some of the early studies were directed toward short pulses of neutrons
exciting the upper isomer state in a solid so the gamma-ray transition could
benefit from the line-narrowing of MÃ¶ssbauer_effect.[52][53] In conjunction,
several advantages were expected from two-stage pumping of a three-level
system.[54] It was conjectured that the nucleus of an atom, embedded in the
near field of a laser-driven coherently-oscillating electron cloud would
experience a larger dipole field than that of the driving laser.[55][56]
Furthermore, nonlinearity of the oscillating cloud would produce both spatial
and temporal harmonics, so nuclear transitions of higher multipolarity could
also be driven at multiples of the laser frequency.[57][58][59][60][61][62][63]
In September 2007, the BBC_News reported that there was speculation about the
possibility of using positronium annihilation to drive a very powerful gamma
ray laser.[64] Dr. David Cassidy of the University_of_California,_Riverside
proposed that a single such laser could be used to ignite a nuclear_fusion
reaction, replacing the banks of hundreds of lasers currently employed in
inertial_confinement_fusion experiments.[64]
Space-based X-ray_lasers pumped by a nuclear explosion have also been proposed
as antimissile weapons.[65][66] Such devices would be one-shot weapons.
Living cells have been used to produce laser light.[67][68] The cells were
genetically engineered to produce green_fluorescent_protein (GFP). The GFP is
used as the laser's "gain medium", where light amplification takes place. The
cells were then placed between two tiny mirrors, just 20 millionths of a meter
across, which acted as the "laser cavity" in which light could bounce many
times through the cell. Upon bathing the cell with blue light, it could be seen
to emit directed and intense green laser light.
***** Uses *****
Lasers range in size from microscopic diode_lasers (top) with numerous
applications, to football field sized neodymium glass lasers (bottom) used for
inertial_confinement_fusion, nuclear_weapons research and other high energy
density physics experiments.
Main article: List_of_applications_for_lasers
When lasers were invented in 1960, they were called "a solution looking for a
problem".[69] Since then, they have become ubiquitous, finding utility in
thousands of highly varied applications in every section of modern society,
including consumer_electronics, information technology, science, medicine,
industry, law_enforcement, entertainment, and the military. Fiber-optic
communication using lasers is a key technology in modern communications,
allowing services such as the Internet.
The first widely noticeable use of lasers was the supermarket barcode_scanner,
introduced in 1974. The laserdisc player, introduced in 1978, was the first
successful consumer product to include a laser but the compact disc player was
the first laser-equipped device to become common, beginning in 1982 followed
shortly by laser_printers.
Some other uses are:
    * Communications: besides fiber-optic_communication, lasers are used for
      free-space_optical_communication, including laser_communication_in_space.
    * Medicine: see below.
    * Industry: cutting including converting thin materials, welding, material
      heat_treatment, marking_parts (engraving and bonding), additive
      manufacturing or 3D_printing processes such as selective_laser_sintering
      and selective_laser_melting, non-contact measurement of parts and 3D
      scanning, and Laser cleaning.
    * Military: marking targets, guiding munitions, missile_defense, electro-
      optical_countermeasures_(EOCM), lidar, blinding troops. See below
    * Law_enforcement: LIDAR_traffic_enforcement. Lasers are used for latent
      fingerprint detection in the forensic_identification field[70][71]
    * Research: spectroscopy, laser_ablation, laser annealing, laser
      scattering, laser interferometry, lidar, laser_capture_microdissection,
      fluorescence_microscopy, metrology, laser_cooling.
    * Commercial products: laser_printers, barcode_scanners, thermometers,
      laser_pointers, holograms, bubblegrams.
    * Entertainment: optical_discs, laser_lighting_displays, laser_turntables
In 2004, excluding diode lasers, approximately 131,000 lasers were sold with a
value of US$2.19 billion.[72] In the same year, approximately 733 million diode
lasers, valued at $3.20 billion, were sold.[73]
**** In medicine ****
Main articles: Laser_medicine and Lasers_in_cancer_treatment
Lasers have many uses in medicine, including laser_surgery (particularly eye
surgery), laser healing, kidney_stone treatment, ophthalmoscopy, and cosmetic
skin treatments such as acne treatment, cellulite and striae reduction, and
hair_removal.
Lasers are used to treat cancer by shrinking or destroying tumors or
precancerous growths. They are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers
that are on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs. They are
used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like
cervical, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and non-small_cell_lung_cancer. Laser
therapy is often combined with other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy,
or radiation_therapy. Laser-induced_interstitial_thermotherapy (LITT), or
interstitial laser photocoagulation, uses lasers to treat some cancers using
hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer
cells. Lasers are more precise than traditional surgery methods and cause less
damage, pain, bleeding, swelling, and scarring. A disadvantage is that surgeons
must have specialized training. It may be more expensive than other treatments.
[74][75]
**** As weapons ****
Further information: Directed-energy_weapon
The US-Israeli Tactical_High_Energy_weapon has been used to shoot down rockets
and artillery shells.
Many types of laser can potentially be used as incapacitating weapons, through
their ability to produce temporary or permanent vision loss when aimed at the
eyes. The degree, character, and duration of vision impairment caused by eye
exposure to laser light varies with the power of the laser, the wavelength(s),
the collimation of the beam, the exact orientation of the beam, and the
duration of exposure. Lasers of even a fraction of a watt in power can produce
immediate, permanent vision loss under certain conditions, making such lasers
potential non-lethal but incapacitating weapons. The extreme handicap that
laser-induced blindness represents makes the use of lasers even as non-lethal
weapons morally controversial, and weapons designed to cause permanent
blindness have been banned by the Protocol_on_Blinding_Laser_Weapons. Weapons
designed to cause temporary blindness, known as dazzlers, are used by military
and sometimes law enforcement organizations. Incidents of pilots being exposed
to lasers while flying have prompted aviation authorities to implement special
procedures to deal with such hazards.[76] See Lasers_and_aviation_safety for
more on this topic.
Laser weapons capable of directly damaging or destroying a target in combat are
still in the experimental stage. The general idea of laser-beam weaponry is to
hit a target with a train of brief pulses of light. The rapid evaporation and
expansion of the surface causes shockwaves that damage the target.[citation
needed] The power needed to project a high-powered laser beam of this kind is
beyond the limit of current mobile power technology, thus favoring chemically
powered gas_dynamic_lasers. Example experimental systems include MIRACL and the
Tactical_High_Energy_Laser.
Boeing YAL-1. The laser system is mounted in a turret attached to the aircraft
nose
Throughout the 2000s, the United_States_Air_Force worked on the Boeing_YAL-1,
an airborne laser mounted in a Boeing 747. It was intended to be used to shoot
down incoming ballistic missiles over enemy territory. In March 2009, Northrop
Grumman claimed that its engineers in Redondo_Beach had successfully built and
tested an electrically powered solid state laser capable of producing a 100-
kilowatt beam, powerful enough to destroy an airplane. According to Brian
Strickland, manager for the United_States_Army's Joint High Power Solid State
Laser program, an electrically powered laser is capable of being mounted in an
aircraft, ship, or other vehicle because it requires much less space for its
supporting equipment than a chemical laser.[77] However, the source of such a
large electrical power in a mobile application remained unclear. Ultimately,
the project was deemed to be infeasible,[78][79][80] and was cancelled in
December 2011,[81] with the Boeing YAL-1 prototype being stored and eventually
dismantled.
The United_States_Navy is developing a laser weapon referred to as the Laser
Weapon_System or LaWS.[82]
**** Hobbies ****
In recent years, some hobbyists have taken interests in lasers. Lasers used by
hobbyists are generally of class IIIa or IIIb (see Safety), although some have
made their own class IV types.[83] However, compared to other hobbyists, laser
hobbyists are far less common, due to the cost and potential dangers involved.
Due to the cost of lasers, some hobbyists use inexpensive means to obtain
lasers, such as salvaging laser diodes from broken DVD players (red), Blu-ray
players (violet), or even higher power laser diodes from CD or DVD_burners.[84]
Hobbyists also have been taking surplus pulsed lasers from retired military
applications and modifying them for pulsed holography. Pulsed Ruby and pulsed
YAG lasers have been used.
**** Examples by power ****
Laser application in astronomical adaptive_optics imaging
Different applications need lasers with different output powers. Lasers that
produce a continuous beam or a series of short pulses can be compared on the
basis of their average power. Lasers that produce pulses can also be
characterized based on the peak power of each pulse. The peak power of a pulsed
laser is many orders_of_magnitude greater than its average power. The average
output power is always less than the power consumed.
           The continuous or average power required for some uses:
Power        Use
    1â5 Laser_pointers
        5 mW CD-ROM drive
   5â10 DVD_player or DVD-ROM_drive
      100 mW High-speed CD-RW burner
      250 mW Consumer 16Ã DVD-R burner

      megajoule laser system adjoining a 10-meter-diameter target chamber[88]
    * 1.3 PW (1.3Ã1015 W) â world's most powerful laser as of 1998, located
      at the Lawrence_Livermore_Laboratory[89]
***** Safety *****
Main article: Laser_safety
[European_laser_warning_symbol]
[US_laser_warning_label]
Left: European laser warning symbol required for Class 2 lasers and higher.
Right: US laser warning label, in this case for a Class 3B laser
Even the first laser was recognized as being potentially dangerous. Theodore
Maiman characterized the first laser as having a power of one "Gillette" as it
could burn through one Gillette razor blade. Today, it is accepted that even
low-power lasers with only a few milliwatts of output power can be hazardous to
human eyesight when the beam hits the eye directly or after reflection from a
shiny surface. At wavelengths which the cornea and the lens can focus well, the
coherence and low divergence of laser light means that it can be focused by the
eye into an extremely small spot on the retina, resulting in localized burning
and permanent damage in seconds or even less time.
Lasers are usually labeled with a safety class number, which identifies how
dangerous the laser is:
    * Class 1 is inherently safe, usually because the light is contained in an
      enclosure, for example in CD players.
    * Class 2 is safe during normal use; the blink_reflex of the eye will
      prevent damage. Usually up to 1 mW power, for example laser pointers.
    * Class 3R (formerly IIIa) lasers are usually up to 5 mW and involve a
      small risk of eye damage within the time of the blink reflex. Staring
      into such a beam for several seconds is likely to cause damage to a spot
      on the retina.
    * Class 3B can cause immediate eye damage upon exposure.
    * Class 4 lasers can burn skin, and in some cases, even scattered light can
      cause eye and/or skin damage. Many industrial and scientific lasers are
      in this class.
The indicated powers are for visible-light, continuous-wave lasers. For pulsed
lasers and invisible wavelengths, other power limits apply. People working with
class 3B and class 4 lasers can protect their eyes with safety goggles which
are designed to absorb light of a particular wavelength.
Infrared lasers with wavelengths longer than about 1.4 micrometers are often
referred to as "eye-safe", because the cornea tends to absorb light at these
wavelengths, protecting the retina from damage. The label "eye-safe" can be
misleading, however, as it applies only to relatively low power continuous wave
beams; a high power or Q-switched laser at these wavelengths can burn the
cornea, causing severe eye damage, and even moderate power lasers can injure
the eye.
Lasers can be a hazard to both civil and military aviation, due to the
potential to temporarily distract or blind pilots. See Lasers_and_aviation
safety for more on this topic.
Cameras based on charge-coupled_devices may actually be more sensitive to laser
damage than biological eyes.[90]
