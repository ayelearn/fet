Manufacturing Systems Integration Program, NIST 2008
Computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) is the manufacturing approach of using
computers to control entire production process.[1][2] This integration allows
individual processes to exchange information with each other and initiate
actions. Although manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone by the
integration of computers, the main advantage is the ability to create automated
manufacturing processes. Typically CIM relies of closed-loop_control_processes,
based on real-time input from sensors. It is also known as flexible design and
manufacturing.[3]

***** Overview[edit] *****
Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and
ship building industries.[4] The term "computer-integrated manufacturing" is
both a method of manufacturing and the name of a computer-automated system in
which individual engineering, production, marketing, and support functions of a
manufacturing enterprise are organized. In a CIM system functional areas such
as design, analysis, planning, purchasing, cost_accounting, inventory_control,
and distribution are linked through the computer with factory floor functions
such as materials_handling and management, providing direct control and
monitoring of all the operations.
As a method of manufacturing, three components distinguish CIM from other
manufacturing methodologies:
    * Means for data_storage, retrieval, manipulation and presentation;
    * Mechanisms for sensing state and modifying processes;
    * Algorithms for uniting the data_processing component with the sensor/
      modification component.
CIM is an example of the implementation of information_and_communication
technologies (ICTs) in manufacturing.
CIM implies that there are at least two computers exchanging information, e.g.
the controller of an arm robot and a micro-controller of a [[]].
Some factors involved when considering a CIM implementation are the production
volume, the experience of the company or personnel to make the integration, the
level of the integration into the product itself and the integration of the
production processes. CIM is most useful where a high level of ICT is used in
the company or facility, such as CAD/CAM systems, the availability of process
planning and its data.
***** History[edit] *****
The idea of "digital manufacturing" became prominent in the early 1970s, with
the release of Dr. Joseph Harrington's book, Computer Integrated Manufacturing.
[5] However,it was not until 1984 when computer-integrated manufacturing began
to be developed and promoted by machine tool manufacturers and the Computer and
Automated Systems Association and Society_of_Manufacturing_Engineers (CASA/
SME).
      "CIM is the integration of total manufacturing enterprise by using
      integrated systems and data communication coupled with new managerial
      philosophies that improve organizational and personnel efficiency." ERHUM
      In a literature research was shown that 37 different concepts of CIM were
      published, most of them from Germany and USA. In a timeline of the 37
      publications it is possible to see how the CIM concept developed over
      time. Also it is quite markable how different the concepts of all
      publications are.[6]
***** Topics[edit] *****
CIM & production control system: Computer Integrated Manufacturing is used to
describe the complete automation of a manufacturing plant, with all processes
running under computer control and digital information tying them together.[7]
**** Key challenges[edit] ****
There are three major challenges to development of a smoothly operating
computer-integrated manufacturing system:
    * Integration of components from different suppliers: When different
      machines, such as CNC, conveyors and robots, are using different
      communications_protocols (In the case of AGVs, even differing lengths of
      time for charging the batteries) may cause problems.
    * Data_integrity: The higher the degree of automation, the more critical is
      the integrity of the data used to control the machines. While the CIM
      system saves on labor of operating the machines, it requires extra human
      labor in ensuring that there are proper safeguards for the data signals
      that are used to control the machines.
    * Process_control: Computers may be used to assist the human operators of
      the manufacturing facility, but there must always be a competent engineer
      on hand to handle circumstances which could not be foreseen by the
      designers of the control software.
**** Subsystems[edit] ****
A computer-integrated manufacturing system is not the same as a "lights-out
factory", which would run completely independent of human intervention,
although it is a big step in that direction. Part of the system involves
flexible_manufacturing, where the factory can be quickly modified to produce
different products, or where the volume of products can be changed quickly with
the aid of computers. Some or all of the following subsystems may be found in a
CIM operation:
Computer-aided techniques:
    * CAD (computer-aided_design)
    * CAE (computer-aided_engineering)
    * CAM (computer-aided_manufacturing)
    * CAPP (computer-aided_process_planning)
    * CAQ (computer-aided_quality_assurance)
    * PPC (production_planning_and_control)
    * ERP (enterprise_resource_planning)
    * A business system integrated by a common database.
Devices and equipment required:
    * CNC, Computer numerical controlled machine tools
    * DNC, Direct numerical control machine tools
    * PLCs, Programmable logic controllers
    * Robotics
    * Computers
    * Software
    * Controllers
    * Networks
    * Interfacing
    * Monitoring equipment
Technologies:
    * FMS, (flexible_manufacturing_system)
    * ASRS, automated_storage_and_retrieval_system
    * AGV, automated_guided_vehicle
    * Robotics
    * Automated conveyance systems
Others:
    * Lean_manufacturing
**** CIMOSA[edit] ****
CIMOSA (Computer Integrated Manufacturing Open System Architecture), is a 1990s
European proposal for an open_systems_architecture for CIM developed by the
AMICE_Consortium as a series of ESPRIT projects.[8][9] The goal of CIMOSA was
"to help companies to manage change and integrate their facilities and
operations to face world wide competition. It provides a consistent
architectural framework for both enterprise_modeling and enterprise_integration
as required in CIM environments".[10]
CIMOSA provides a solution for business integration with four types of
products:[11]
    * The CIMOSA Enterprise Modeling Framework, which provides a reference
      architecture for enterprise_architecture
    * CIMOSA IIS, a standard for physical and application integration.
    * CIMOSA Systems Life Cycle, is a life cycle model for CIM development and
      deployment.
    * Inputs to standardization, basics for international standard development.
CIMOSA according to Vernadat (1996), coined the term business_process and
introduced the process-based approach for integrated enterprise_modeling based
on a cross-boundaries approach, which opposed to traditional function or
activity-based approaches. With CIMOSA also the concept of an "Open_System
Architecture" (OSA) for CIM was introduced, which was designed to be vendor-
independent, and constructed with standardised CIM modules. Here to the OSA is
"described in terms of their function, information, resource, and
organizational aspects. This should be designed with structured_engineering
methods and made operational in a modular and evolutionary_architecture for
operational use".[10]
***** Application[edit] *****
There are multiple areas of usage:
    * In Industrial_and_Production_engineering
    * In mechanical_engineering
    * In electronic_design_automation (printed_circuit_board (PCB) and
      integrated_circuit design data for manufacturing)
