Titanium drilling
Drilling is a cutting process that uses a drill_bit to cut a hole of circular
cross-section in solid materials. The drill bit is usually a rotary cutting
tool, often multi-point. The bit is pressed against the work-piece and rotated
at rates from hundreds to thousands of revolutions_per_minute. This forces the
cutting edge against the work-piece, cutting off chips_(swarf) from the hole as
it is drilled.
In rock drilling, the hole is usually not made through a circular cutting
motion, though the bit is usually rotated. Instead, the hole is usually made by
hammering a drill bit into the hole with quickly repeated short movements. The
hammering action can be performed from outside the hole (top-hammer_drill) or
within the hole (down-the-hole_drill, DTH). Drills used for horizontal drilling
are called drifter_drills.
In rare cases, specially-shaped bits are used to cut holes of non-circular
cross-section; a square cross-section is possible.[1]

***** Process[edit] *****
Drilled holes are characterized by their sharp edge on the entrance side and
the presence of burrs on the exit side (unless they have been removed). Also,
the inside of the hole usually has helical feed marks.[2]
Drilling may affect the mechanical properties of the workpiece by creating low
residual_stresses around the hole opening and a very thin layer of highly
stressed and disturbed material on the newly formed surface. This causes the
workpiece to become more susceptible to corrosion and crack_propagation at the
stressed surface. A finish operation may be done to avoid these detrimental
conditions.
For fluted drill bits, any chips are removed via the flutes. Chips may form
long spirals or small flakes, depending on the material, and process
parameters.[2] The type of chips formed can be an indicator of the
machinability of the material, with long chips suggesting good material
machinability.
When possible drilled holes should be located perpendicular to the workpiece
surface. This minimizes the drill bit's tendency to "walk", that is, to be
deflected from the intended center-line of the bore, causing the hole to be
misplaced. The higher the length-to-diameter ratio of the drill bit, the
greater the tendency to walk. The tendency to walk is also preempted in various
other ways, which include:
    * Establishing a centering mark or feature before drilling, such as by:
          o Casting, molding, or forging a mark into the workpiece
          o Center_punching
          o Spot_drilling (i.e., center drilling)
          o Spot_facing, which is machining a certain area on a casting or
            forging to establish an accurately located face on an otherwise
            rough surface.
    * Constraining the position of the drill bit using a drill_jig with drill
      bushings
Surface_finish produced by drilling may range from 32 to 500 microinches.
Finish cuts will generate surfaces near 32 microinches, and roughing will be
near 500 microinches.
Cutting_fluid is commonly used to cool the drill bit, increase tool life,
increase speeds_and_feeds, increase the surface finish, and aid in ejecting
chips. Application of these fluids is usually done by flooding the workpiece
with coolant and lubricant or by applying a spray mist.[2]
In deciding which drill(s) to use it is important to consider the task at hand
and evaluate which drill would best accomplish the task. There are a variety of
drill styles that each serve a different purpose. The subland drill is capable
of drilling more than one diameter. The spade drill is used to drill larger
hole sizes. The indexable drill is useful in managing chips.[2]
**** Spot drilling[edit] ****
See also: Drill_bit_Â§ Center_and_spotting_drill_bits
The purpose of spot drilling is to drill a hole that will act as a guide for
drilling the final hole. The hole is only drilled part way into the workpiece
because it is only used to guide the beginning of the next drilling process.
**** Center drilling[edit] ****
See also: Drill_bit_Â§ Center_and_spotting_drill_bits
Centre drill is A two-fluted tool consisting of a twist drill with a 60Â°
countersink; used to drill countersink center holes in a workpiece to be
mounted between centers for turning or grinding.
**** Deep hole drilling[edit] ****
Blast hole several meters long, drilled in granite
Deep hole drilling is defined as drilling a hole of depth greater than ten
times the diameter of the hole.[3] These types of holes require special
equipment to maintain the straightness and tolerances. Other considerations are
roundness and surface finish.
Deep hole drilling is generally achievable with a few tooling methods, usually
gun_drilling or BTA drilling. These are differentiated due to the coolant entry
method (internal or external) and chip removal method (internal or external).
Using methods such as a rotating tool and counter-rotating workpiece are common
techniques to achieve required straightness tolerances.[4] Secondary tooling
methods include trepanning, skiving and burnishing, pull boring, or bottle
boring. Finally, a new kind of drilling technology is available to face this
issue: vibration drilling. This technology breaks up the chips by a small
controlled axial vibration of the drill. The small chips are easily removed by
the flutes of the drill.
A high tech monitoring system is used to control force, torque, vibrations, and
acoustic emission. Vibration is considered a major defect in deep hole drilling
which can often cause the drill to break. A special coolant is usually used to
aid in this type of drilling.
*** Gun drilling[edit] ***
Main article: Gun_drill
Gun drilling was originally developed to drill out gun barrels and is used
commonly for drilling smaller diameter deep holes. The depth-to-diameter ratio
can be even greater than 300:1. The key feature of gun drilling is that the
bits are self-centering; this is what allows for such deep accurate holes. The
bits use a rotary motion similar to a twist drill; however, the bits are
designed with bearing pads that slide along the surface of the hole keeping the
drill bit on center. Gun drilling is usually done at high speeds and low feed
rates.
*** Trepanning[edit] ***
Trepanning is commonly used for creating larger diameter holes (up to 915 mm
(36.0 in)) where a standard drill bit is not feasible or economical. Trepanning
removes the desired diameter by cutting out a solid disk similar to the
workings of a drafting_compass. Trepanning is performed on flat products such
as sheet metal, granite (curling_stone), plates, or structural members like I-
beams. Trepanning can also be useful to make grooves for inserting seals, such
as O-rings.
**** Microdrilling[edit] ****
Microdrilling refers to the drilling of holes less than 0.5 mm (0.020 in).
Drilling of holes at this small diameter presents greater problems since
coolant fed drills cannot be used and high spindle speeds are required. High
spindle speeds that exceed 10,000 RPM also require the use of balanced tool
holders.
**** Vibration drilling[edit] ****
Titanium chips â conventional drilling vs vibration drilling
Vibration drilling of an aluminum-CFRP multi-material stack with MITIS
technology
The first studies into vibration drilling began in the 1950s (Pr. V.N.
Poduraev, Moscow Bauman University). The main principle consists in generating
axial vibrations or oscillations in addition to the feed movement of the drill
so that the chips break up and are then easily removed from the cutting zone.
There are two main technologies of vibration drilling: self-maintained
vibration systems and forced vibration systems. Most vibration drilling
technologies are still at a research stage. In the case of self-maintained
vibration drilling, the eigenfrequency of the tool is used in order to make it
naturally vibrate while cutting; vibrations are self-maintained by a mass-
spring system included in the tool holder.[5] Other works use a piezoelectric
system to generate and control the vibrations. These systems allow high
vibration frequencies (up to 2 kHz) for small magnitude (about a few
micrometers); they are particularly suitable for drilling small holes. Finally,
vibrations can be generated by mechanical systems:[6] the frequency is given by
the combination of the rotation speed and the number of oscillation per
rotation (a few oscillations per rotation), with magnitude about 0.1 mm.
This last technology is a fully industrial one (example: SineHolingÂ®
technology of MITIS). Vibration drilling is a preferred solution in situations
like deep hole drilling, multi-material stack drilling (aeronautics) and dry
drilling (without lubrication). Generally, it provides improved reliability and
greater control of the drilling operation.
**** Circle interpolating[edit] ****
The orbital drilling principle
Circle interpolating, also known as orbital drilling, is a process for creating
holes using machine cutters.
Orbital drilling is based on rotating a cutting_tool around its own axis and
simultaneously about a centre axis which is off-set from the axis of the
cutting tool. The cutting tool can then be moved simultaneously in an axial
direction to drill or machine a hole â and/or combined with an arbitrary
sidewards motion to machine an opening or cavity.
By adjusting the offset, a cutting tool of a specific diameter can be used to
drill holes of different diameters as illustrated. This implies that the
cutting tool inventory can be substantially reduced.
The term orbital drilling comes from that the cutting tool âorbitsâ around
the hole center. The mechanically forced, dynamic offset in orbital drilling
has several advantages compared to conventional drilling that drastically
increases the hole precision. The lower thrust force results in a burr-less
hole when drilling in metals. When drilling in composite_materials the problem
with delamination is eliminated.[7]
***** Material[edit] *****
**** Drilling in metal[edit] ****
High-speed steel twist bit drilling into aluminium with methylated spirits
lubricant
Under normal usage, swarf is carried up and away from the tip of the drill bit
by the fluting of the drill bit. The cutting edges produce more chips which
continue the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful
until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or
insufficient backing off (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole
while drilling). Cutting_fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to
prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow.
Coolant may be introduced via holes through the drill shank, which is common
when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid
helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from
grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass,
and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes "chatter", a face
of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an
obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents "chatter" during which the
drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting
edge, the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This
creates high friction and very hot swarf.
[Magnetic_Drilling_Machine]
Magnetic Drilling Machine (manufactured by BDS Maschinen GmbH, Germany)
For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the
drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in
the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill_press
arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in
automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather
than the drill bit.
In computer_numerical_control (CNC) machine_tools a process called peck
drilling, or interrupted cut drilling, is used to keep swarf from detrimentally
building up when drilling deep holes (approximately when the depth of the hole
is three times greater than the drill diameter). Peck drilling involves
plunging the drill part way through the workpiece, no more than five times the
diameter of the drill, and then retracting it to the surface. This is repeated
until the hole is finished. A modified form of this process, called high speed
peck drilling or chip breaking, only retracts the drill slightly. This process
is faster, but is only used in moderately long holes, otherwise it will
overheat the drill bit. It is also used when drilling stringy material to break
the chips.[8][9][10]
When it is not possible to bring the material to the Ð¡NÐ¡ machine, a Magnetic
Base Drilling Machine may be used. The base allows drilling in a horizontal
position and even on a ceiling. Usually, for these machines, it is better to
use cutters because they can drill much faster with less speed. Cutter sizes
vary from 12mm to 200mm DIA and from 30mm to 200mm DOC(depth of cut). These
machines are widely used in construction, fabrication, marine, and oil & gas
industries. In the oil_and_gas_industry, pneumatic magnetic drilling machines
are used to avoid sparks, as well as special tube magnetic drilling machines
that can be fixed on pipes of different sizes, even inside.
**** Drilling in wood[edit] ****
Wood being softer than most metals, drilling in wood is considerably easier and
faster than drilling in metal. Cutting fluids are not used or needed. The main
issue in drilling wood is ensuring clean entry and exit holes and preventing
burning. Avoiding burning is a question of using sharp bits and the appropriate
cutting_speed. Drill bits can tear out chips of wood around the top and bottom
of the hole and this is undesirable in fine woodworking applications.
The ubiquitous twist drill bits used in metalworking also work well in wood,
but they tend to chip wood out at the entry and exit of the hole. In some
cases, as in rough holes for carpentry, the quality of the hole does not
matter, and a number of bits for fast cutting in wood exist, including spade
bits and self-feeding auger bits. Many types of specialised drill bits for
boring clean holes in wood have been developed, including brad-point bits,
Forstner_bits and hole_saws. Chipping on exit can be minimized by using a piece
of wood as backing behind the work piece, and the same technique is sometimes
used to keep the hole entry neat.
Holes are easier to start in wood as the drill bit can be accurately positioned
by pushing it into the wood and creating a dimple. The bit will thus have
little tendency to wander.
**** Others[edit] ****
Some materials like plastics as well as other non-metals and some metals have a
tendency to heat up enough to expand making the hole smaller than desired.
***** Related processes[edit] *****
The following are some related processes that often accompany drilling:
  Counterboring 
      This process creates a stepped hole in which a larger diameter follows a
      smaller diameter partially into a hole.
  Countersinking 
      This process is similar to counterboring but the step in the hole is
      cone-shaped.
  Boring 
      Boring precisely enlarges an already existing hole using a single point
      cutter.
  Friction_drilling 
      drilling holes using plastic deformation of the subject (under heat and
      pressure) instead of cutting it.
  Reaming 
      Reaming is designed to enlarge the size of a hole to leave smooth sides.
