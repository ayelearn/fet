Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material[1]
by advancing a cutter into a workpiece. This may be done varying direction[2]
on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure.[3] Milling covers a
wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small
individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations. It is one of the
most commonly used processes for machining custom parts to precise tolerances.
Milling can be done with a wide range of machine_tools. The original class of
machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill). After
the advent of computer_numerical_control_(CNC) in the 1960s, milling machines
evolved into machining centers: milling machines augmented by automatic tool
changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC capability, coolant systems, and
enclosures. Milling centers are generally classified as vertical machining
centers (VMCs) or horizontal machining centers (HMCs).
The integration of milling into turning environments, and vice versa, began
with live_tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning
operations. This led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines
(MTMs), which are purpose-built to facilitate milling and turning within the
same work envelope.

***** Process[edit] *****
Face milling process (cutter rotation axis is vertical - 0Â° inclination
relative to tool axis)
Milling is a cutting process that uses a milling_cutter to remove material from
the surface of a workpiece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting_tool, often
with multiple cutting points. As opposed to drilling, where the tool is
advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved
perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the
cutter. As the milling cutter enters the workpiece, the cutting edges (flutes
or teeth) of the tool repeatedly cut into and exit from the material, shaving
off chips_(swarf) from the workpiece with each pass. The cutting action is
shear deformation; material is pushed off the workpiece in tiny clumps that
hang together to a greater or lesser extent (depending on the material) to form
chips. This makes metal cutting somewhat different (in its mechanics) from
slicing softer materials with a blade.
The milling process removes material by performing many separate, small cuts.
This is accomplished by using a cutter with many teeth, spinning the cutter at
high speed, or advancing the material through the cutter slowly; most often it
is some combination of these three approaches.[2] The speeds_and_feeds used are
varied to suit a combination of variables. The speed at which the piece
advances through the cutter is called feed rate, or just feed; it is most often
measured in length of material per full revolution of the cutter.
There are two major classes of milling process:
    * In face milling, the cutting action occurs primarily at the end corners
      of the milling cutter. Face milling is used to cut flat surfaces (faces)
      into the workpiece, or to cut flat-bottomed cavities.
    * In peripheral milling, the cutting action occurs primarily along the
      circumference of the cutter, so that the cross section of the milled
      surface ends up receiving the shape of the cutter. In this case the
      blades of the cutter can be seen as scooping out material from the work
      piece. Peripheral milling is well suited to the cutting of deep slots,
      threads, and gear teeth.
**** Milling cutters[edit] ****
Main article: Milling_cutter
Many different types of cutting tools are used in the milling process. Milling
cutters such as endmills may have cutting surfaces across their entire end
surface, so that they can be drilled into the workpiece (plunging). Milling
cutters may also have extended cutting surfaces on their sides to allow for
peripheral milling. Tools optimized for face milling tend to have only small
cutters at their end corners.
The cutting surfaces of a milling cutter are generally made of a hard and
temperature-resistant material, so that they wear slowly. A low cost cutter may
have surfaces made of high_speed_steel. More expensive but slower-wearing
materials include cemented_carbide. Thin film coatings may be applied to
decrease friction or further increase hardness.
There are cutting tools typically used in milling machines or machining centres
to perform milling operations (and occasionally in other machine tools). They
remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g., a ball nose mill)
or directly from the cutter's shape (e.g., a form tool such as a hobbing
cutter).

showing the position of the cutter for each cutting pass and how it corresponds
with the ridges (cutter rotation axis is perpendicular to image plane)
As material passes through the cutting area of a milling machine, the blades of
the cutter take swarfs of material at regular intervals. Surfaces cut by the
side of the cutter (as in peripheral milling) therefore always contain regular
ridges. The distance between ridges and the height of the ridges depend on the
feed rate, number of cutting surfaces, the cutter diameter.[4] With a narrow
cutter and rapid feed rate, these revolution ridges can be significant
variations in the surface_finish.
Trochoidal marks, characteristic of face milling.
The face milling process can in principle produce very flat surfaces. However,
in practice the result always shows visible trochoidal marks following the
motion of points on the cutter's end face. These revolution marks give the
characteristic finish of a face milled surface. Revolution marks can have
significant roughness depending on factors such as flatness of the cutter's end
face and the degree of perpendicularity between the cutter's rotation axis and
feed direction. Often a final pass with a slow feed rate is used to improve the
surface finish after the bulk of the material has been removed. In a precise
face milling operation, the revolution marks will only be microscopic scratches
due to imperfections in the cutting edge.

Heavy gang milling of milling machine tables
Gang milling refers to the use of two or more milling_cutters mounted on the
same arbor (that is, ganged) in a horizontal-milling setup. All of the cutters
may perform the same type of operation, or each cutter may perform a different
type of operation. For example, if several workpieces need a slot, a flat
surface, and an angular groove, a good method to cut these (within a non-CNC
context) would be gang milling. All the completed workpieces would be the same,
and milling time per piece would be minimized.[5]
Gang milling was especially important before the CNC era, because for duplicate
part production, it was a substantial efficiency improvement over manual-
milling one feature at an operation, then changing machines (or changing setup
of the same machine) to cut the next op. Today, CNC mills with automatic tool
change and 4- or 5-axis control obviate gang-milling practice to a large
extent.
***** Equipment[edit] *****
Milling is performed with a milling_cutter in various forms, held in a collett
or similar which, in turn, is held in the spindle of a milling machine.
**** Types and nomenclature[edit] ****
Mill orientation is the primary classification for milling machines. The two
basic configurations are vertical and horizontal. However, there are
alternative classifications according to method of control, size, purpose and
power source.
*** Mill orientation[edit] ***
** Vertical mill[edit] **
Vertical milling machine. 1: milling cutter 2: spindle 3: top slide or overarm
4: column 5: table 6: Y-axis slide 7: knee 8: base
In the vertical mill the spindle axis is vertically oriented. Milling_cutters
are held in the spindle and rotate on its axis. The spindle can generally be
extended (or the table can be raised/lowered, giving the same effect), allowing
plunge cuts and drilling. There are two subcategories of vertical mills: the
bed mill and the turret mill.
    * A turret mill has a stationary spindle and the table is moved both
      perpendicular and parallel to the spindle axis to accomplish cutting. The
      most common example of this type is the Bridgeport, described below.
      Turret mills often have a quill which allows the milling cutter to be
      raised and lowered in a manner similar to a drill press. This type of
      machine provides two methods of cutting in the vertical (Z) direction: by
      raising or lowering the quill, and by moving the knee.
    * In the bed mill, however, the table moves only perpendicular to the
      spindle's axis, while the spindle itself moves parallel to its own axis.
Turret mills are generally considered by some to be more versatile of the two
designs. However, turret mills are only practical as long as the machine
remains relatively small. As machine size increases, moving the knee up and
down requires considerable effort and it also becomes difficult to reach the
quill feed handle (if equipped). Therefore, larger milling machines are usually
of the bed type.
A third type also exists, a lighter machine, called a mill-drill, which is a
close relative of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists. A mill-
drill is similar in basic configuration to a small drill press, but equipped
with an X-Y table. They also typically use more powerful motors than a
comparably sized drill press, with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally
have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a drill press to deal with the
lateral loading on the spindle that is created by a milling operation. A mill
drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often
on a dovetailed vertical, where a drill press motor remains stationary, while
the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar. Other differences that
separate a mill-drill from a drill press may be a fine tuning adjustment for
the Z-axis, a more precise depth stop, the capability to lock the X, Y or Z
axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and
powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting. Aside from size and precision, the
principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical
mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled
in basically the same fashion as drill press, where a larger vertical or knee
mill has a vertically fixed milling head, and changes the X-Y table elevation.
As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck,
rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts collets. These are
frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the
hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints
and modest price tags.
** Horizontal milling machine[edit] **
Horizontal milling machine. 1: base 2: column 3: knee 4 & 5: table (x-axis
slide is integral) 6: overarm 7: arbor (attached to spindle)
A horizontal mill has the same sort but the cutters are mounted on a horizontal
spindle (see Arbor_milling) across the table. Many horizontal mills also
feature a built-in rotary table that allows milling at various angles; this
feature is called a universal table. While endmills and the other types of
tools available to a vertical mill may be used in a horizontal mill, their real
advantage lies in arbor-mounted cutters, called side and face mills, which have
a cross section rather like a circular saw, but are generally wider and smaller
in diameter. Because the cutters have good support from the arbor and have a
larger cross-sectional area than an end mill, quite heavy cuts can be taken
enabling rapid material removal rates. These are used to mill grooves and
slots. Plain mills are used to shape flat surfaces. Several cutters may be
ganged together on the arbor to mill a complex shape of slots and planes.
Special cutters can also cut grooves, bevels, radii, or indeed any section
desired. These specialty cutters tend to be expensive. Simplex mills have one
spindle, and duplex mills have two. It is also easier to cut_gears on a
horizontal mill. Some horizontal milling machines are equipped with a power-
take-off provision on the table. This allows the table feed to be synchronized
to a rotary fixture, enabling the milling of spiral features such as hypoid
gears.
** Comparative merits[edit] **
The choice between vertical and horizontal spindle orientation in milling
machine design usually hinges on the shape and size of a workpiece and the
number of sides of the workpiece that require machining. Work in which the
spindle's axial movement is normal to one plane, with an endmill as the cutter,
lends itself to a vertical mill, where the operator can stand before the
machine and have easy access to the cutting action by looking down upon it.
Thus vertical mills are most favored for diesinking work (machining a mould
into a block of metal).[6] Heavier and longer workpieces lend themselves to
placement on the table of a horizontal mill.
Prior to numerical_control, horizontal milling machines evolved first, because
they evolved by putting milling tables under lathe-like headstocks. Vertical
mills appeared in subsequent decades, and accessories in the form of add-on
heads to change horizontal mills to vertical mills (and later vice versa) have
been commonly used. Even in the CNC era, a heavy workpiece needing machining on
multiple sides lends itself to a horizontal machining center, while diesinking
lends itself to a vertical one.
*** Alternative classifications[edit] ***
In addition to horizontal versus vertical, other distinctions are also
important:

                             universal service, that is, a wider range of possible toolpaths. Machine

*** Variants[edit] ***

    * Bed mill This refers to any milling machine where the spindle is on a
      pendant that moves up and down to move the cutter into the work, while
      the table sits on a stout bed that rests on the floor. These are
      generally more rigid than a knee mill. Gantry mills can be included in
      this bed mill category.
    * Box mill or column mill Very basic hobbyist bench-mounted milling
      machines that feature a head riding up and down on a column or box way.
    * C-frame mill These are larger, industrial production mills. They feature
      a knee and fixed spindle head that is only mobile vertically. They are
      typically much more powerful than a turret mill, featuring a separate
      hydraulic motor for integral hydraulic power feeds in all directions, and
      a twenty to fifty horsepower motor. Backlash eliminators are almost
      always standard equipment. They use large NMTB 40 or 50 tooling. The
      tables on C-frame mills are usually 18" by 68" or larger, to allow
      multiple parts to be machined at the same time.
    * Floor mill These have a row of rotary tables, and a horizontal pendant
      spindle mounted on a set of tracks that runs parallel to the table row.
      These mills have predominantly been converted to CNC, but some can still
      be found (if one can even find a used machine available) under manual
      control. The spindle carriage moves to each individual table, performs
      the machining operations, and moves to the next table while the previous
      table is being set up for the next operation. Unlike other mills, floor
      mills have movable floor units. A crane drops massive rotary tables, X-
      Y tables, etc., into position for machining, allowing large and complex
      custom milling operations.
    * Gantry mill The milling head rides over two rails (often steel shafts)
      which lie at each side of the work surface.
    * Horizontal boring mill Large, accurate bed horizontal mills that
      incorporate many features from various machine tools. They are
      predominantly used to create large manufacturing jigs, or to modify
      large, high precision parts. They have a spindle stroke of several
      (usually between four and six) feet, and many are equipped with a
      tailstock to perform very long boring operations without losing accuracy
      as the bore increases in depth. A typical bed has X and Y travel, and is
      between three and four feet square with a rotary table or a larger
      rectangle without a table. The pendant usually provides between four and
      eight feet of vertical movement. Some mills have a large (30" or more)
      integral facing head. Right angle rotary tables and vertical milling
      attachments are available for further flexibility.
    * Jig_borer Vertical mills that are built to bore holes, and very light
      slot or face milling. They are typically bed mills with a long spindle
      throw. The beds are more accurate, and the handwheels are graduated down
      to .0001" for precise hole placement.
    * Knee mill or knee-and-column mill refers to any milling machine whose x-
      y table rides up and down the column on a vertically adjustable knee.
      This includes Bridgeports.
    * Planer-style mill (Plano Milling)Large mills built in the same
      configuration as planers except with a milling spindle instead of a
      planing head. This term is growing dated as planers themselves are
      largely a thing of the past.
    * Ram-type mill This can refer to any mill that has a cutting head mounted
      on a sliding ram. The spindle can be oriented either vertically or
      horizontally. In practice most mills with rams also involve swiveling
      ability, whether or not it is called "turret" mounting. The Bridgeport
      configuration can be classified as a vertical-head ram-type mill. Van
      Norman specialized in ram-type mills through most of the 20th century.
      Since the wide dissemination of CNC machines, ram-type mills are still
      made in the Bridgeport configuration (with either manual or CNC control),
      but the less common variations (such as were built by Van Norman, Index,
      and others) have died out, their work being done now by either
      Bridgeport-form mills or machining centers.
    * Turret mill More commonly referred to as Bridgeport-type milling
      machines. The spindle can be aligned in many different positions for a
      very versatile, if somewhat less rigid machine.
*** Alternative terminology[edit] ***
A milling machine is often called a mill by machinists. The archaic term miller
was commonly used in the 19th and early 20th centuries.[7]
Since the 1960s there has developed an overlap of usage between the terms
milling machine and machining center. NC/CNC machining centers evolved from
milling machines, which is why the terminology evolved gradually with
considerable overlap that still persists. The distinction, when one is made, is
that a machining center is a mill with features that pre-CNC mills never had,
especially an automatic tool changer (ATC) that includes a tool magazine
(carousel), and sometimes an automatic pallet changer (APC). In typical usage,
all machining centers are mills, but not all mills are machining centers; only
mills with ATCs are machining centers.
**** Computer numerical control[edit] ****

cutter
Most CNC milling machines (also called machining centers) are computer
controlled vertical mills with the ability to move the spindle vertically along
the Z-axis. This extra degree of freedom permits their use in diesinking,
engraving applications, and 2.5D surfaces such as relief sculptures. When
combined with the use of conical tools or a ball_nose_cutter, it also
significantly improves milling precision without impacting speed, providing a
cost-efficient alternative to most flat-surface hand-engraving work.
Five-axis machining center with rotating table and computer_interface
CNC machines can exist in virtually any of the forms of manual machinery, like
horizontal mills. The most advanced CNC milling-machines, the multiaxis
machine, add two more axes in addition to the three normal axes (XYZ).
Horizontal milling machines also have a C or Q axis, allowing the horizontally
mounted workpiece to be rotated, essentially allowing asymmetric and eccentric
turning. The fifth axis (B axis) controls the tilt of the tool itself. When all
of these axes are used in conjunction with each other, extremely complicated
geometries, even organic geometries such as a human head can be made with
relative ease with these machines. But the skill to program such geometries is
beyond that of most operators. Therefore, 5-axis milling machines are
practically always programmed with CAM.
The operating system of such machines is a closed loop system and functions on
feedback. These machines have developed from the basic NC (NUMERIC CONTROL)
machines. A computerized form of NC machines is known as CNC machines. A set of
instructions (called a program) is used to guide the machine for desired
operations. Some very commonly used codes, which are used in the program are:
G00 â rapid traverse
G01 â linear interpolation of tool.
G21 â dimensions in metric units.
M03/M04 â spindle start (clockwise/counter clockwise).
T01 M06 â automatic tool change to tool 1
M30 â program end.
Various other codes are also used. A CNC machine is operated by a single
operator called a programmer. This machine is capable of performing various
operations automatically and economically.
With the declining price of computers and open_source_CNC_software, the entry
price of CNC machines has plummeted.

**** Tooling[edit] ****
The accessories and cutting tools used on machine tools (including milling
machines) are referred to in aggregate by the mass_noun "tooling". There is a
high degree of standardization of the tooling used with CNC milling machines,
and a lesser degree with manual milling machines. To ease up the organization
of the tooling in CNC production many companies use a tool_management solution.
Milling_cutters for specific applications are held in various tooling
configurations.
CNC milling machines nearly always use SK (or ISO), CAT, BT or HSK tooling. SK
tooling is the most common in Europe, while CAT tooling, sometimes called V-
Flange Tooling, is the oldest and probably most common type in the USA. CAT
tooling was invented by Caterpillar_Inc. of Peoria,_Illinois, in order to
standardize the tooling used on their machinery. CAT tooling comes in a range
of sizes designated as CAT-30, CAT-40, CAT-50, etc. The number refers to the
Association_for_Manufacturing_Technology (formerly the National Machine Tool
Builders Association (NMTB)) Taper_size of the tool.

An improvement on CAT Tooling is BT Tooling, which looks similar and can easily
be confused with CAT tooling. Like CAT Tooling, BT Tooling comes in a range of
sizes and uses the same NMTB body taper. However, BT tooling is symmetrical
about the spindle axis, which CAT tooling is not. This gives BT tooling greater
stability and balance at high speeds. One other subtle difference between these
two toolholders is the thread used to hold the pull stud. CAT Tooling is all
Imperial thread and BT Tooling is all Metric thread. Note that this affects the
pull stud only; it does not affect the tool that they can hold. Both types of
tooling are sold to accept both Imperial and metric sized tools.
SK and HSK tooling, sometimes called "Hollow Shank Tooling", is much more
common in Europe where it was invented than it is in the United States. It is
claimed that HSK tooling is even better than BT Tooling at high speeds. The
holding mechanism for HSK tooling is placed within the (hollow) body of the
tool and, as spindle speed increases, it expands, gripping the tool more
tightly with increasing spindle speed. There is no pull stud with this type of
tooling.
For manual milling machines, there is less standardization, because a greater
plurality of formerly competing standards exist. Newer and larger manual
machines usually use NMTB tooling. This tooling is somewhat similar to CAT
tooling but requires a drawbar within the milling machine. Furthermore, there
are a number of variations with NMTB tooling that make interchangeability
troublesome. The older a machine, the greater the plurality of standards that
may apply (e.g., Morse, Jarno, Brown_&_Sharpe, Van_Norman, and other less
common builder-specific tapers). However, two standards that have seen
especially wide usage are the Morse #2 and the R8, whose prevalence was driven
by the popularity of the mills built by Bridgeport_Machines of Bridgeport,
Connecticut. These mills so dominated the market for such a long time that
"Bridgeport" is virtually synonymous with "manual milling machine". Most of the
machines that Bridgeport made between 1938 and 1965 used a Morse taper #2, and
from about 1965 onward most used an R8 taper.

***** CNC pocket milling[edit] *****
Pocket milling has been regarded as one of the most widely used operations in
machining. It is extensively used in aerospace and shipyard industries. In
pocket milling the material inside an arbitrarily closed boundary on a flat
surface of a work piece is removed to a fixed depth. Generally flat bottom end
mills are used for pocket milling. Firstly roughing operation is done to remove
the bulk of material and then the pocket is finished by a finish end mill.[8]
Most of the industrial milling operations can be taken care of by 2.5_axis CNC
milling. This type of path control can machine up to 80% of all mechanical
parts. Since the importance of pocket milling is very relevant, therefore
effective pocketing approaches can result in reduction in machining_time and
cost.[9] NC pocket milling can be carried out mainly by two tool paths, viz.
linear and non-linear.[10]
**** Linear tool path[edit] ****
In this approach, the tool movement is unidirectional. Zig-zag and zig tool
paths are the examples of linear tool path.
*** Zig-zag tool path[edit] ***
In zig-zag milling, material is removed both in forward and backward paths. In
this case, cutting is done both with and against the rotation of the spindle.
This reduces the machining time but increases machine_chatter and tool_wear.
*** Zig tool path[edit] ***
In zig milling, the tool moves only in one direction. The tool has to be lifted
and retracted after each cut, due to which machining time increases. However,
in case of zig milling surface quality is better.
**** Non-linear tool path[edit] ****
In this approach, tool movement is multi-directional. One example of non-linear
tool path is contour-parallel tool path.
*** Contour-parallel tool path[edit] ***
In this approach, the required pocket boundary is used to derive the tool path.
In this case the cutter is always in contact with the work material. Hence the
idle time spent in positioning and retracting the tool is avoided. For large-
scale material removal, contour-parallel tool path is widely used because it
can be consistently used with up-cut or down-cut method during the entire
process. There are three different approaches that fall into the category of
contour-parallel tool path generation. They are:
    * Pair-wise intersection approach:In pair-wise intersection approach, the
      boundary of the pocket is brought inwards in steps, The offset segments
      will intersect at concave corners. To obtain the required contour, these
      intersections are to be trimmed off. On the other hand, in case of convex
      corner, the offset segments are extended and thereby connected to make
      the contour. These operations viz. offsetting, trimming and extending are
      repeatedly done to cover the entire machining volume with sufficient
      layer of profiles.[11]
    * Voronoi_diagram approach: In voronoi diagram approach, the pocket
      boundary is segmented and voronoi diagram is constructed for the entire
      pocket boundary. These voronoi diagrams are used for generating the tool
      path for machining. This method is considered to be more efficient and
      robust. Moreover, it avoids topological problems associated with
      traditional offsetting algorithms.[12][13]
*** Curvilinear tool path[edit] ***
In this approach, the tool travels along a gradually evolving spiral path. The
spiral starts at the center of the pocket to be machined and the tool gradually
moves towards the pocket boundary. The direction of the tool path changes
progressively and local acceleration and deceleration of the tool are
minimized. This reduces tool wear.[14]

***** History[edit] *****
**** 1795-1810[edit] ****
Milled gear teeth on a Terry style wooden movement clock.
Milling machines evolved from the practice of rotary filingâthat is, running
a circular cutter with file-like teeth in the headstock of a lathe. Rotary
filing and, later, true milling were developed to reduce time and effort spent
hand-filing. The full story of milling machine development may never be known,
because much early development took place in individual shops where few records
were kept for posterity. However, the broad outlines are known, as summarized
below. From a history-of-technology viewpoint, it is clear that the naming of
this new type of machining with the term "milling" was an extension from that
word's earlier senses of processing materials by abrading them in some way
(cutting, grinding, crushing, etc.). Rotary filing long predated milling. A
rotary file by Jacques_de_Vaucanson, circa 1760, is well known.[15][16]
In 1795, Eli_Terry began using a milling machine at Plymouth Connecticut in the
production of tall case clocks. With the use of his milling machine, Terry was
the first to accomplish Interchangeable_parts in the clock industry. Milling
wooden parts was efficient in interchangeable parts, but inefficient in high
yields. Milling wooden blanks results in a low yield of parts because the
machines single blade would cause loss of gear teeth when the cutter hit
parallel grains in the wood. Terry later invented a spindle cutting machine to
mass produce parts in 1807. Other Connecticut clockmakers like James Harrison
of Waterbury, Thomas Barnes of Litchfield, and Gideon Roberts of Bristol, also
used milling machines to produce their clocks. [17]
**** 1810sâ1830s[edit] ****
This milling machine was long credited to Eli Whitney and dated to circa 1818.
From the 1910s through the 1940s, this version of its provenance was widely
published. In the 1950s and 1960s, various historians of technology mostly
discredited the view of this machine as the first miller and possibly even of
Whitney as its builder. Nonetheless, it is still an important early milling
machine, regardless of its exact provenance.
The Middletown milling machine of circa 1818, associated with Robert Johnson
and Simeon North.
The milling machine built by James Nasmyth between 1829 and 1831 for milling
the six sides of a hex nut using an indexing fixture.
It is clear that milling machines as a distinct class of machine tool (separate
from lathes running rotary files) first appeared between 1814 and 1818. The
centers of earliest development of true milling machines were two federal
armories of the U.S. (Springfield and Harpers_Ferry) together with the various
private armories and inside_contractors that shared turnover of skilled workmen
with them. Between 1912 and 1916, Joseph_W._Roe, a respected founding father of
machine tool historians, credited Eli_Whitney (one of the private arms makers
mentioned above) with producing the first true milling machine.[18][19] By
1918, he considered it "Probably the first milling machine ever
builtâcertainly the oldest now in existence [â¦]."[20] However, subsequent
scholars, including Robert S. Woodbury[21] and others,[22] have improved upon
Roe's early version of the history and suggest that just as much creditâin
fact, probably moreâbelongs to various other inventors, including Robert
Johnson of Middletown,_Connecticut; Captain_John_H._Hall of the Harpers Ferry
armory; Simeon_North of the Staddle Hill factory in Middletown; Roswell Lee of
the Springfield armory; and Thomas_Blanchard. (Several of the men mentioned
above are sometimes described on the internet as "the inventor of the first
milling machine" or "the inventor of interchangeable parts". Such claims are
oversimplified, as these technologies evolved over time among many people.)
Peter Baida,[22] citing Edward A. Battison's article "Eli Whitney and the
Milling Machine," which was published in the Smithsonian Journal of History in
1966, exemplifies the dispelling of the "Great_Man" image of Whitney by
historians of technology working in the 1950s and 1960s. He quotes Battison as
concluding that "There is no evidence that Whitney developed or used a true
milling machine." Baida says, "The so-called Whitney machine of 1818 seems
actually to have been made after Whitney's death in 1825." Baida cites
Battison's suggestion that the first true milling machine was made not by
Whitney, but by Robert Johnson of Middletown.[22]
The late teens of the 19th century were a pivotal time in the history of
machine tools, as the period of 1814 to 1818 is also the period during which
several contemporary pioneers (Fox, Murray, and Roberts) were developing the
planer,[23] and as with the milling machine, the work being done in various
shops was undocumented for various reasons (partially because of proprietary
secrecy, and also simply because no one was taking down records for posterity).
James_Nasmyth built a milling machine very advanced for its time between 1829
and 1831.[24] It was tooled to mill the six sides of a hex nut that was mounted
in a six-way indexing fixture.
A milling machine built and used in the shop of Gay & Silver (aka Gay, Silver,
& Co) in the 1830s was influential because it employed a better method of
vertical positioning than earlier machines. For example, Whitney's machine (the
one that Roe considered the very first) and others did not make provision for
vertical travel of the knee. Evidently, the workflow assumption behind this was
that the machine would be set up with shims, vise, etc. for a certain part
design, and successive parts did not require vertical adjustment (or at most
would need only shimming). This indicates that early thinking about milling
machines was as production machines, not toolroom machines.
In these early years, milling was often viewed as only a roughing operation to
be followed by finishing with a hand file. The idea of reducing hand filing was
more important than replacing it.
**** 1840sâ1860[edit] ****
A typical Lincoln miller. The configuration was established in the 1850s. (This
example was built by Pratt_&_Whitney, probably 1870s or 1880s.)
Some of the key men in milling machine development during this era included
Frederick_W._Howe, Francis_A._Pratt, Elisha_K._Root, and others. (These same
men during the same era were also busy developing the state of the art in
turret_lathes. Howe's experience at Gay & Silver in the 1840s acquainted him
with early versions of both machine tools. His machine tool designs were later
built at Robbins_&_Lawrence, the Providence_Tool_Company, and Brown_&_Sharpe.)
The most successful milling machine design to emerge during this era was the
Lincoln miller, which rather than being a specific make and model of machine
tool is truly a family of tools built by various companies on a common
configuration over several decades. It took its name from the first company to
put one on the market, George S. Lincoln & Company (formerly the Phoenix Iron
Works), whose first one was built in 1855 for the Colt armory.[25]
During this era there was a continued blind spot in milling machine design, as
various designers failed to develop a truly simple and effective means of
providing slide travel in all three of the archetypal milling axes (X, Y, and
Zâor as they were known in the past, longitudinal, traverse, and vertical).
Vertical positioning ideas were either absent or underdeveloped. The Lincoln
miller's spindle could be raised and lowered, but the original idea behind its
positioning was to be set up in position and then run, as opposed to being
moved frequently while running. Like a turret lathe, it was a repetitive-
production machine, with each skilled setup followed by extensive fairly low
skill operation.
**** 1860s[edit] ****
Brown & Sharpe's groundbreaking universal milling machine, 1861
In 1861, Frederick W. Howe, while working for the Providence Tool Company,
asked Joseph R. Brown of Brown_&_Sharpe for a solution to the problem of
milling spirals, such as the flutes of twist drills. These were usually filed
by hand at the time.[26] (Helical_planing existed but was by no means common.)
Brown designed a "universal milling machine" that, starting from its first sale
in March 1862, was wildly successful. It solved the problem of 3-axis travel
(i.e., the axes that we now call XYZ) much more elegantly than had been done in
the past, and it allowed for the milling of spirals using an indexing_head fed
in coordination with the table feed. The term "universal" was applied to it
because it was ready for any kind of work, including toolroom work, and was not
as limited in application as previous designs. (Howe had designed a "universal
miller" in 1852, but Brown's of 1861 is the one considered a groundbreaking
success.)[26]
Brown also developed and patented (1864) the design of formed milling cutters
in which successive sharpenings of the teeth do not disturb the geometry of the
form.[16]
The advances of the 1860s opened the floodgates and ushered in modern milling
practice.
**** 1870s to World War I[edit] ****
A typical universal milling machine of the early 20th century. Suitable for
toolroom, jobbing, or production use.
In these decades, Brown_&_Sharpe and the Cincinnati_Milling_Machine_Company
dominated the milling machine field. However, hundreds of other firms also
built milling machines at the time, and many were significant in various ways.
Besides a wide variety of specialized production machines, the archetypal
multipurpose milling machine of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was a
heavy knee-and-column horizontal-spindle design with power table feeds,
indexing head, and a stout overarm to support the arbor. The evolution of
machine design was driven not only by inventive spirit but also by the constant
evolution_of_milling_cutters that saw milestone after milestone from 1860
through World_War_I.[27][28]
**** World War I and interwar period[edit] ****
Around the end of World War I, machine tool control advanced in various ways
that laid the groundwork for later CNC technology. The jig_borer popularized
the ideas of coordinate dimensioning (dimensioning of all locations on the part
from a single reference point); working routinely in "tenths" (ten-thousandths
of an inch, 0.0001") as an everyday machine capability; and using the control
to go straight from drawing to part, circumventing jig-making. In 1920 the new
tracer design of J.C. Shaw was applied to Keller tracer milling machines for
die-sinking via the three-dimensional copying of a template. This made
diesinking faster and easier just as dies were in higher demand than ever
before, and was very helpful for large steel dies such as those used to stamp
sheets in automobile manufacturing. Such machines translated the tracer
movements to input for servos that worked the machine leadscrews or hydraulics.
They also spurred the development of antibacklash_leadscrew_nuts. All of the
above concepts were new in the 1920s but became routine in the NC/CNC era. By
the 1930s, incredibly large and advanced milling machines existed, such as the
Cincinnati Hydro-Tel, that presaged today's CNC mills in every respect except
for CNC control itself.
*** Bridgeport milling machine[edit] ***
In 1936, Rudolph Bannow (1897â1962) conceived of a major improvement to the
milling machine.[29] His company commenced manufacturing a new knee-and-column
vertical mill in 1938. This was the Bridgeport milling machine, often called a
ram-type or turret-type mill because its head has sliding-ram and rotating-
turret mounting. The machine became so popular that many other manufacturers
created copies and variants. Furthermore, its name came to connote any such
variant. The Bridgeport offered enduring advantages over previous models. It
was small enough, light enough, and affordable enough to be a practical
acquisition for even the smallest machine shop businesses, yet it was also
smartly designed, versatile, well-built, and rigid. Its various directions of
sliding and pivoting movement allowed the head to approach the work from any
angle. The Bridgeport's design became the dominant form for manual milling
machines used by several generations of small-_and_medium-enterprise
machinists. By the 1980s an estimated quarter-million Bridgeport milling
machines had been built,[29] and they (and their clones) are still being
produced today.
**** 1940sâ1970s[edit] ****
By 1940, automation via cams, such as in screw_machines_and_automatic_chuckers,
had already been very well developed for decades. Beginning in the 1930s, ideas
involving servomechanisms had been in the air, but it was especially during and
immediately after World_War_II that they began to germinate (see also Numerical
control_>_History). These were soon combined with the emerging technology of
digital computers. This technological development milieu, spanning from the
immediate preâWorld War II period into the 1950s, was powered by the military
capital expenditures that pursued contemporary advancements in the directing of
gun and rocket artillery and in missile_guidanceâother applications in which
humans wished to control the kinematics/dynamics of large machines quickly,
precisely, and automatically. Sufficient R&D spending probably would not have
happened within the machine tool industry alone; but it was for the latter
applications that the will and ability to spend was available. Once the
development was underway, it was eagerly applied to machine tool control in one
of the many post-WWII instances of technology_transfer.
In 1952, numerical control reached the developmental stage of laboratory
reality. The first NC machine tool was a Cincinnati Hydrotel milling machine
retrofitted with a scratch-built NC control unit. It was reported in Scientific
American,[30] just as another groundbreaking milling machine, the Brown &
Sharpe universal, had been in 1862.
During the 1950s, numerical control moved slowly from_the_laboratory_into
commercial_service. For its first decade, it had rather limited impact outside
of aerospace work. But during the 1960s and 1970s, NC evolved into CNC, data
storage and input media evolved, computer processing power and memory capacity
steadily increased, and NC and CNC machine tools gradually disseminated from an
environment of huge corporations and mainly aerospace work to the level of
medium-sized corporations and a wide variety of products. NC and CNC's drastic
advancement of machine tool control deeply transformed the culture of
manufacturing.[31] The details (which are beyond the scope of this article)
have evolved immensely with every passing decade.
**** 1980sâpresent[edit] ****
Computers and CNC machine tools continue to develop rapidly. The personal
computer revolution has a great impact on this development. By the late 1980s
small machine shops had desktop computers and CNC machine tools. Soon after,
hobbyists, artists, and designers began obtaining CNC mills and lathes.
Manufacturers have started producing economically priced CNCs machines small
enough to sit on a desktop which can cut at high resolution materials softer
than stainless steel. They can be used to make anything from jewelry to printed
circuit boards to gun parts, even fine art.
***** Milling standards[edit] *****
National and international standards are used to standardize the definitions,
environmental requirements, and test methods used for milling. Selection of the
standard to be used is an agreement between the supplier and the user and has
some significance in the design of the mill. In the United States, ASME has
developed the standards B5.45-1972 Milling Machines and B94.19-1997 Milling
Cutters and End Mills.
General tolerances include: +/-.005" for local tolerances across most
geometries, +/-.010" for plastics with variation depending on the size of the
part, 0.030" minimum wall thickness for metals, and 0.060" minimum wall
thickness for plastics.[32]
