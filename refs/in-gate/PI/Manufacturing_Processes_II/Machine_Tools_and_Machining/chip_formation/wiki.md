****** Chip formation ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Chip formation is part of the process of cutting materials by mechanical means,
using tools such as saws, lathes and milling cutters. An understanding of the
theory and engineering of this formation is an important part of the
development of such machines and their cutting tools.
The formal study of chip formation was encouraged around World_War_II and
shortly afterwards, with increases in the use of faster and more powerful
cutting machines, particularly for metal cutting with the new high_speed_steel
cutters. Pioneering work in this field was carried out by Kivima (1952) and
Franz (1958).[1][2]
Chip formation is usually described according to a three-way model developed by
Franz. This model is best known within the field of machine tool design,
although it is also used when an application area, such as woodworking,
requires a vocabulary to describe chip formation in more detail than is usually
attempted.[3][4]

***** Chip classification[edit] *****
The first three chip types are the original characterisation, by Dr. Norman
Franz. The type of chip that forms depends on many factors, of both tool and
material. In general, main factors are the angle formed by the edge faces of
the tool and also the angle at which this is presented to the surface.
Sharpness of the cutting tool does not usually define the type of chip, but
rather the quality of the chip, and the clear distinctions between types. A
blunt tool produces a degenerate chip that is large, torn and varies from one
means of formation to another, often leaving behind a poor quality surface
where this means changes.
**** Type I chip[edit] ****
Type I chip
Type I chips form when a material splits ahead of the cutting edge, owing to
some upwards wedge action of the tool exceeding the tensile_strength of the
material, perpendicular to the surface. They are thus particularly important in
fibrous materials, such as wood, where individual fibres are strong but they
may be levered apart relatively easily. Type I chips generally form in cutting
by tools with shallow cutting angles.
Type I chips may form long, continuous swarf, limited in size only by the
length of cut.
This is the idealised chip formation for wood_shavings,[4] particularly those
produced by a well-tuned plane with a finely adjusted mouth.
**** Type II chip[edit] ****
Type II chip
Type II chips form when a shearing force is produced by the wedge of the tool
angle. The material fails along a short angled plane, from the apex of the tool
edge, diagonally upwards and forwards to the surface. The material deforms
along this line, forming an upward curling chip. These chips generally form
from intermediate cutting angles.
Type II chips may form in ductile materials, such as metals.
Type II chips may also form long, continuous swarf.
**** Type III chip[edit] ****
Type III chip formation during climb_milling
Type III chips form a compression failure of the material, ahead of a
relatively obtuse cutting angle, approaching 90Â°. In some weak or non-ductile
materials this may form an acceptable chip, usually as a fine dust, but often
it gives rise instead to a random "snowplough" effect where the waste material
is bunched up ahead of the tool but not cleared decisively away as a well-
formed chip.
This type of chip is formed by routers. It is also formed by woodworking
scrapers, although when properly sharpened and used, these form such a thin
Type III chip that it instead appears as a well-formed Type II chip. Their
waste chip is thin enough that the compression failure volume is small enough
to act as for the well-defined shear plane of the Type II.
**** Type 0 chip[edit] ****
This type was characterised later, by William McKenzie (1960).[i]
