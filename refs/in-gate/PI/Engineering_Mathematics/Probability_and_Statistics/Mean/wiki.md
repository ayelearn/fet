This article is about the mathematical concept. For other uses, see Mean_
(disambiguation).
For the state of being mean or cruel, see meanness.
For broader coverage of this topic, see average.
There are several kinds of means in various branches of mathematics (especially
statistics).
For a data_set, the arithmetic_mean, also called the mathematical_expectation
or average, is the central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically,
the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a
set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted by        x &#x00AF;
{\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}  [{\bar {x}}], pronounced "x bar". If the data set
were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical
population, the arithmetic mean is the sample mean (denoted        x &#x00AF;
{\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}  [{\bar {x}}]) to distinguish it from the mean of
the underlying distribution, the population mean (denoted    &#x03BC;
{\displaystyle \mu }  [\mu ] or     &#x03BC;  x     {\displaystyle \mu _{x}}
[\mu _{x}]).[1] Pronounced "mew" /'mjuË/.
In probability and statistics, the population mean, or expected_value, are a
measure of the central_tendency either of a probability_distribution or of the
random_variable characterized by that distribution.[2] In the case of a
discrete_probability_distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to
the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value;
that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and
its probability p(x), and then adding all these products together, giving
&#x03BC; = &#x2211; x p ( x )   {\displaystyle \mu =\sum xp(x)}  [
{\displaystyle \mu =\sum xp(x)}].[3] An analogous formula applies to the case
of a continuous_probability_distribution. Not every probability distribution
has a defined mean; see the Cauchy_distribution for an example. Moreover, for
some distributions the mean is infinite.
For a finite population, the population mean of a property is equal to the
arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the
population. For example, the population mean height is equal to the sum of the
heights of every individual divided by the total number of individuals. The
sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples.
The law_of_large_numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample, the
more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.[4]
Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of "mean" are
often used in geometry and analysis; examples are given below.

***** Types of mean[edit] *****
**** Pythagorean means[edit] ****
Main article: Pythagorean_means
*** Arithmetic mean (AM)[edit] ***
Main article: Arithmetic_mean
The arithmetic mean (or simply mean) of a sample      x  1   ,  x  2   ,
&#x2026; ,  x  n     {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}}  [x_{1},x_
{2},\ldots ,x_{n}], usually denoted by        x &#x00AF;      {\displaystyle
{\bar {x}}}  [{\bar {x}}], is the sum of the sampled values divided by the
number of items in the sample
            x &#x00AF;    =   1 n    (   &#x2211;  i = 1   n     x  i     )  =
      x  1   +  x  2   + &#x22EF; +  x  n    n     {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=
      {\frac {1}{n}}\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}\right)={\frac {x_{1}+x_
      {2}+\cdots +x_{n}}{n}}}  [{\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac {1}{n}}\left
      (\sum _{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}\right)={\frac {x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots +x_{n}}{n}}}]
For example, the arithmetic mean of five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is:
            4 + 36 + 45 + 50 + 75  5   =   210 5   = 42.   {\displaystyle
      {\frac {4+36+45+50+75}{5}}={\frac {210}{5}}=42.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {4+36+45+50+75}{5}}={\frac {210}{5}}=42.}]
*** Geometric mean (GM)[edit] ***
The geometric_mean is an average that is useful for sets of positive numbers
that are interpreted according to their product and not their sum (as is the
case with the arithmetic mean); e.g., rates of growth.
            x &#x00AF;    =   (   &#x220F;  i = 1   n     x  i     )    1 n
      =   (   x  1    x  2   &#x22EF;  x  n    )    1 n      {\displaystyle
      {\bar {x}}=\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}\right)^{\frac {1}{n}}=\left(x_
      {1}x_{2}\cdots x_{n}\right)^{\frac {1}{n}}}  [{\displaystyle {\bar
      {x}}=\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}\right)^{\frac {1}{n}}=\left(x_{1}x_
      {2}\cdots x_{n}\right)^{\frac {1}{n}}}]
For example, the geometric mean of five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is:
         ( 4 &#x00D7; 36 &#x00D7; 45 &#x00D7; 50 &#x00D7; 75  )   1 5    =
      24  300  000   5    = 30.   {\displaystyle (4\times 36\times 45\times
      50\times 75)^{\frac {1}{5}}={\sqrt[{5}]{24\;300\;000}}=30.}  [
      {\displaystyle (4\times 36\times 45\times 50\times 75)^{\frac {1}{5}}=
      {\sqrt[{5}]{24\;300\;000}}=30.}]
*** Harmonic mean (HM)[edit] ***
The harmonic_mean is an average which is useful for sets of numbers which are
defined in relation to some unit, for example speed (distance per unit of
time).
            x &#x00AF;    = n   (   &#x2211;  i = 1   n     1  x  i      )
      &#x2212; 1     {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=n\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\frac {1}
      {x_{i}}}\right)^{-1}}  [{\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=n\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}
      {\frac {1}{x_{i}}}\right)^{-1}}]
For example, the harmonic mean of the five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is
           5     1 4    +    1 36    +    1 45    +    1 50    +    1 75
      =   5      1 3        = 15.   {\displaystyle {\frac {5}{{\tfrac {1}{4}}+
      {\tfrac {1}{36}}+{\tfrac {1}{45}}+{\tfrac {1}{50}}+{\tfrac {1}{75}}}}=
      {\frac {5}{\;{\tfrac {1}{3}}\;}}=15.}  [{\frac {5}{{\tfrac {1}{4}}+
      {\tfrac {1}{36}}+{\tfrac {1}{45}}+{\tfrac {1}{50}}+{\tfrac {1}{75}}}}=
      {\frac {5}{\;{\tfrac {1}{3}}\;}}=15.]
*** Relationship between AM, GM, and HM[edit] ***
Main article: Inequality_of_arithmetic_and_geometric_means
AM, GM, and HM satisfy these inequalities:
          A M  &#x2265;  G M  &#x2265;  H M     {\displaystyle \mathrm {AM}
      \geq \mathrm {GM} \geq \mathrm {HM} \,}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {AM}
      \geq \mathrm {GM} \geq \mathrm {HM} \,}]
Equality holds if and only if all the elements of the given sample are equal.
**** Statistical location[edit] ****
See also: Average_Â§ Statistical_location
Comparison of the arithmetic mean, median and mode of two skewed (log-normal)
distributions.
Geometric visualization of the mode, median and mean of an arbitrary
probability density function.[5]
In descriptive_statistics, the mean may be confused with the median, mode or
mid-range, as any of these may be called an "average" (more formally, a measure
of central_tendency). The mean of a set of observations is the arithmetic
average of the values; however, for skewed_distributions, the mean is not
necessarily the same as the middle value (median), or the most likely value
(mode). For example, mean income is typically skewed upwards by a small number
of people with very large incomes, so that the majority have an income lower
than the mean. By contrast, the median income is the level at which half the
population is below and half is above. The mode income is the most likely
income and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes. While the
median and mode are often more intuitive measures for such skewed data, many
skewed distributions are in fact best described by their mean, including the
exponential and Poisson distributions.
**** Mean of a probability distribution[edit] ****
Main article: Expected_value
The mean of a probability_distribution is the long-run arithmetic average value
of a random_variable having that distribution. In this context, it is also
known as the expected_value. For a discrete_probability_distribution, the mean
is given by      &#x2211; x P ( x )    {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum xP(x)}
[\textstyle \sum xP(x)], where the sum is taken over all possible values of the
random variable and     P ( x )   {\displaystyle P(x)}  [P(x)] is the
probability_mass_function. For a continuous_distribution,the mean is
&#x222B;  &#x2212; &#x221E;   &#x221E;   x f ( x )  d x    {\displaystyle
\textstyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }xf(x)\,dx}  [\textstyle \int _{-\infty }^
{\infty }xf(x)\,dx], where     f ( x )   {\displaystyle f(x)}  [f(x)] is the
probability_density_function. In all cases, including those in which the
distribution is neither discrete nor continuous, the mean is the Lebesgue
integral of the random variable with respect to its probability_measure. The
mean need not exist or be finite; for some probability distributions the mean
is infinite (+∞ or â∞), while others have no mean.
**** Generalized means[edit] ****
*** Power mean[edit] ***
The generalized_mean, also known as the power mean or HÃ¶lder mean, is an
abstraction of the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means. It is
defined for a set of n positive numbers xi by
            x &#x00AF;    ( m ) =   (    1 n    &#x2211;  i = 1   n    x  i   m
      )    1 m      {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}(m)=\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _
      {i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{m}\right)^{\frac {1}{m}}}  [{\displaystyle {\bar {x}}
      (m)=\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{m}\right)^{\frac {1}{m}}}]
By choosing different values for the parameter m, the following types of means
are obtained:
         m &#x2192; &#x221E;                 maximum of      x  i
      {\displaystyle m\rightarrow \infty }   {\displaystyle x_{i}}  [x_{i}]
      [m\rightarrow \infty ]
         m = 2   {\displaystyle m=2}  [m=2]  quadratic_mean
         m = 1   {\displaystyle m=1}  [m=1]  arithmetic_mean
         m &#x2192; 0   {\displaystyle       geometric_mean
      m\rightarrow 0}  [m\rightarrow 0]
         m = &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle m=- harmonic_mean
      1}  [m=-1]
         m &#x2192; &#x2212; &#x221E;        minimum of      x  i
      {\displaystyle m\rightarrow -\infty }  {\displaystyle x_{i}}  [x_{i}]
      [m\rightarrow -\infty ]
*** Æ-mean[edit] ***
This can be generalized further as the generalized_Æ-mean
            x &#x00AF;    =  f  &#x2212; 1    (    1 n    &#x2211;  i = 1   n
      f  (  x  i   )    )    {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}=f^{-1}\left({{\frac {1}
      {n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}{f\left(x_{i}\right)}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle {\bar
      {x}}=f^{-1}\left({{\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}{f\left(x_
      {i}\right)}}\right)}]
and again a suitable choice of an invertible Æ will give
         f ( x ) = x   {\displaystyle f(x)=x}  [f(x)=x]        arithmetic_mean,
         f ( x ) =   1 x     {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}    harmonic_mean,
      {x}}}  [f(x)={\frac {1}{x}}]
         f ( x ) =  x  m     {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{m}}  [f    power_mean,
      (x)=x^{m}]
         f ( x ) = ln &#x2061; ( x )   {\displaystyle f(x)=\ln geometric_mean.
      (x)}  [{\displaystyle f(x)=\ln(x)}]
**** Weighted arithmetic mean[edit] ****
The weighted_arithmetic_mean (or weighted average) is used if one wants to
combine average values from samples of the same population with different
sample sizes:
            x &#x00AF;    =     &#x2211;  i = 1   n     w  i    x  i
      &#x2211;  i = 1   n    w  i      .   {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac
      {\sum _{i=1}^{n}{w_{i}x_{i}}}{\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}}}.}  [{\displaystyle
      {\bar {x}}={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}{w_{i}x_{i}}}{\sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{i}}}.}]
The weights      w  i     {\displaystyle w_{i}}  [w_{i}] represent the sizes of
the different samples. In other applications, they represent a measure for the
reliability of the influence upon the mean by the respective values.
**** Truncated mean[edit] ****
Sometimes a set of numbers might contain outliers, i.e., data values which are
much lower or much higher than the others. Often, outliers are erroneous data
caused by artifacts. In this case, one can use a truncated_mean. It involves
discarding given parts of the data at the top or the bottom end, typically an
equal amount at each end and then taking the arithmetic mean of the remaining
data. The number of values removed is indicated as a percentage of the total
number of values.
**** Interquartile mean[edit] ****
The interquartile_mean is a specific example of a truncated mean. It is simply
the arithmetic mean after removing the lowest and the highest quarter of
values.
            x &#x00AF;    =   2 n     &#x2211;  i =   n 4   + 1     3 4   n
      x  i     {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac {2}{n}}\;\sum _{i={\frac {n}
      {4}}+1}^{{\frac {3}{4}}n}\!\!x_{i}}  [{\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac
      {2}{n}}\;\sum _{i={\frac {n}{4}}+1}^{{\frac {3}{4}}n}\!\!x_{i}}]
assuming the values have been ordered, so is simply a specific example of a
weighted mean for a specific set of weights.
**** Mean of a function[edit] ****
Main article: Mean_of_a_function
In some circumstances mathematicians may calculate a mean of an infinite (even
an uncountable) set of values. This can happen when calculating the mean value
y  ave     {\displaystyle y_{\text{ave}}}  [{\displaystyle y_{\text{ave}}}] of
a function     f ( x )   {\displaystyle f(x)}  [f(x)]. Intuitively this can be
thought of as calculating the area under a section of a curve and then dividing
by the length of that section. This can be done crudely by counting squares on
graph paper or more precisely by integration. The integration formula is
written as:
          y  ave   ( a , b ) =   1  b &#x2212; a     &#x222B;  a   b    f ( x )
      d x   {\displaystyle y_{\text{ave}}(a,b)={\frac {1}{b-a}}\int \limits _
      {a}^{b}\!f(x)\,dx}  [{\displaystyle y_{\text{ave}}(a,b)={\frac {1}{b-
      a}}\int \limits _{a}^{b}\!f(x)\,dx}]
Care must be taken to make sure that the integral converges. But the mean may
be finite even if the function itself tends to infinity at some points.
**** Mean of angles and cyclical quantities[edit] ****
Angles, times of day, and other cyclical quantities require modular_arithmetic
to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, there will not
be a unique mean. For example, the times an hour before and after midnight are
equidistant to both midnight and noon. It is also possible that no mean exists.
Consider a color_wheel -- there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these
situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by
adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized_approach_for
the_mean_of_circular_quantities.
**** FrÃ©chet mean[edit] ****
The FrÃ©chet_mean gives a manner for determining the "center" of a mass
distribution on a surface or, more generally, Riemannian_manifold. Unlike many
other means, the FrÃ©chet mean is defined on a space whose elements cannot
necessarily be added together or multiplied by scalars. It is sometimes also
known as the Karcher mean (named after Hermann Karcher).

***** Distribution of the sample mean[edit] *****
Main article: Standard_error_of_the_mean
The arithmetic mean of a population, or population mean, is often denoted Î¼.
The sample mean        x &#x00AF;      {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}  [{\bar {x}}]
(the arithmetic mean of a sample of values drawn from the population) makes a
good estimator of the population mean, as its expected value is equal to the
population mean (that is, it is an unbiased_estimator). The sample mean is a
random_variable, not a constant, since its calculated value will randomly
differ depending on which members of the population are sampled, and
consequently it will have its own distribution. For a random sample of n
independent observations, the expected value of the sample mean is
         E &#x2061;    x &#x00AF;    = &#x03BC;   {\displaystyle \operatorname
      {E} {\bar {x}}=\mu }  [{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} {\bar {x}}=\mu }]
and the variance of the sample mean is
         var &#x2061; (    x &#x00AF;    ) =    &#x03C3;  2   n   .
      {\displaystyle \operatorname {var} ({\bar {x}})={\frac {\sigma ^{2}}
      {n}}.}  [{\displaystyle \operatorname {var} ({\bar {x}})={\frac {\sigma ^
      {2}}{n}}.}]
If the population is normally_distributed, then the sample mean is normally
distributed:
            x &#x00AF;    &#x223C; N  {  &#x03BC; ,    &#x03C3;  2   n    }  .
      {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}\thicksim N\left\{\mu ,{\frac {\sigma ^{2}}
      {n}}\right\}.}  [{\bar  {x}}\thicksim N\left\{\mu ,{\frac  {\sigma ^{2}}
      {n}}\right\}.]
If the population is not normally distributed, the sample mean is nonetheless
approximately normally distributed if n is large and Ï2/n < +â. This follows
from the central_limit_theorem.
The mean of a list is all of the numbers added together and divided by the
amount of numbers
