Practical demonstrations of ergonomic principles
Human factors and ergonomics (commonly referred to as human factors) is the
application of psychological and physiological principles to the (engineering
and) design of products, processes, and systems. The goal of human factors is
to reduce human error, increase productivity, and enhance safety and comfort
with a specific focus on the interaction between the human and the thing of
interest.[1]
The field is a combination of numerous disciplines, such as psychology,
sociology, engineering, biomechanics, industrial_design, physiology,
anthropometry, interaction_design, visual_design, user_experience, and user
interface_design. In research, human factors employs the scientific method to
study human behavior so that the resultant data may be applied to the four
primary goals. In essence, it is the study of designing equipment, devices and
processes that fit the human body and its cognitive abilities. The two terms
"human factors" and "ergonomics" are essentially synonymous.[2][3][4]
The International_Ergonomics_Association defines ergonomics or human factors as
follows:[5]
     Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned
     with the understanding of interactions among humans and other
     elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory,
     principles, data and methods to design to optimize human well-being
     and overall system performance.

Human factors is employed to fulfill the goals of occupational_health_and
safety and productivity. It is relevant in the design of such things as safe
furniture and easy-to-use interfaces to machines and equipment.
Proper ergonomic design is necessary to prevent repetitive_strain_injuries and
other musculoskeletal_disorders, which can develop over time and can lead to
long-term disability.
Human factors and ergonomics is concerned with the "fit" between the user,
equipment, and environment or "fitting a job to a person".[6] It accounts for
the user's capabilities and limitations in seeking to ensure that tasks,
functions, information, and the environment suit that user.
To assess the fit between a person and the used technology, human factors
specialists or ergonomists consider the job (activity) being done and the
demands on the user; the equipment used (its size, shape, and how appropriate
it is for the task), and the information used (how it is presented, accessed,
and changed). Ergonomics draws on many disciplines in its study of humans and
their environments, including anthropometry, biomechanics, mechanical
engineering, industrial_engineering, industrial design, information_design,
kinesiology, physiology, cognitive_psychology, industrial_and_organizational
psychology, and space_psychology.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The term ergonomics (from the Greek á¼ÏÎ³Î¿Î½, meaning "work", and
Î½ÏÎ¼Î¿Ï, meaning "natural law") first entered the modern lexicon when Polish
scientist Wojciech_JastrzÄbowski used the word in his 1857 article Rys
ergonomji czyli nauki o pracy, opartej na prawdach poczerpniÄtych z Nauki
Przyrody (The Outline of Ergonomics; i.e. Science of Work, Based on the Truths
Taken from the Natural Science).[7] The French scholar Jean-Gustave_Courcelle-
Seneuil, apparently without knowledge of JastrzÄbowski's article, used the
word with a slightly different meaning in 1858. The introduction of the term to
the English lexicon is widely attributed to British psychologist Hywel_Murrell,
at the 1949 meeting at the UK's Admiralty, which led to the foundation of The
Ergonomics_Society. He used it to encompass the studies in which he had been
engaged during and after World War II.[8]
The expression human factors is a predominantly North American[9] term which
has been adopted to emphasize the application of the same methods to non-work-
related situations. A "human factor" is a physical or cognitive property of an
individual or social behavior specific to humans that may influence the
functioning of technological systems. The terms "human factors" and
"ergonomics" are essentially synonymous.[2]
***** Domains of specialization[edit] *****
Ergonomics comprise three main fields of research: physical, cognitive and
organizational ergonomics.
There are many specializations within these broad categories. Specializations
in the field of physical ergonomics may include visual ergonomics.
Specializations within the field of cognitive ergonomics may include usability,
humanâcomputer_interaction, and user experience engineering.
Some specializations may cut across these domains: Environmental ergonomics is
concerned with human interaction with the environment as characterized by
climate, temperature, pressure, vibration, light.[10] The emerging field of
human_factors_in_highway_safety uses human factor principles to understand the
actions and capabilities of road users â car and truck drivers, pedestrians,
cyclists, etc. â and use this knowledge to design roads and streets to reduce
traffic_collisions. Driver error is listed as a contributing factor in 44% of
fatal collisions in the United States, so a topic of particular interest is how
road users gather and process information about the road and its environment,
and how to assist them to make the appropriate decision.[11]
New terms are being generated all the time. For instance, "user trial engineer"
may refer to a human factors professional who specializes in user trials.
[citation_needed] Although the names change, human factors professionals apply
an understanding of human factors to the design of equipment, systems and
working methods to improve comfort, health, safety, and productivity.
According to the International_Ergonomics_Association, within the discipline of
ergonomics there exist domains of specialization.
**** Physical ergonomics[edit] ****
Physical ergonomics: the science of designing user interaction with equipment
and workplaces to fit the user.
Physical ergonomics is concerned with human anatomy, and some of the
anthropometric, physiological and bio mechanical characteristics as they relate
to physical activity.[5] Physical ergonomic principles have been widely used in
the design of both consumer and industrial products. Risk factors such as
localized mechanical pressures, force and  posture in a sedentary office
environment lead to injuries attributed to an occupational environment.[12]
Physical ergonomics is important in the medical field, particularly to those
diagnosed with physiological ailments or disorders such as arthritis (both
chronic and temporary) or carpal_tunnel_syndrome. Pressure that is
insignificant or imperceptible to those unaffected by these disorders may be
very painful, or render a device unusable, for those who are. Many
ergonomically designed products are also used or recommended to treat or
prevent such disorders, and to treat pressure-related chronic_pain.[citation
needed]
One of the most prevalent types of work-related injuries is musculoskeletal
disorder. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) result in persistent
pain, loss of functional capacity and work disability, but their initial
diagnosis is difficult because they are mainly based on complaints of pain and
other symptoms.[13] Every year, 1.8 million U.S. workers experience WRMDs and
nearly 600,000 of the injuries are serious enough to cause workers to miss
work.[14] Certain jobs or work conditions cause a higher rate of worker
complaints of undue strain, localized fatigue, discomfort, or pain that does
not go away after overnight rest. These types of jobs are often those involving
activities such as repetitive and forceful exertions; frequent, heavy, or
overhead lifts; awkward work positions; or use of vibrating equipment.[15] The
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has found substantial
evidence that ergonomics programs can cut workers' compensation costs, increase
productivity and decrease employee turnover.[16] Mitigation solutions can
include both short term and long term solutions.  Short and long term solutions
involve awareness training, positioning of the body, furniture and equipment
and ergonomic exercises. Sit-stand stations and computer accessories that
provide soft surfaces for resting the palm as well as split keyboards are
recommended.  Additionally, resources within the HR department can be allocated
to provide assessments to employees to ensure the above listed criteria is met.
[17] Therefore, it is important to gather data to identify jobs or work
conditions that are most problematic, using sources such as injury and illness
logs, medical records, and job analyses.[15]
Ergonomically correct Keyboard
Innovative workstations that are being tested include: sit-stand desks,
treadmill desks, pedal devices and cycle ergometers. In multiple studies these
new workstations resulted in decreased waist circumference and psychological
well being, however a significant number of additional studies have seen no
marked improvement in health outcomes.[18]
**** Cognitive ergonomics[edit] ****
Main article: Cognitive_ergonomics
Cognitive ergonomics is concerned with mental processes, such as perception,
memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans
and other elements of a system.[5] (Relevant topics include mental workload,
decision-making, skilled performance, human reliability, work stress and
training as these may relate to human-system and Human-Computer_Interaction
design.) Epidemiological studies show a correlation between the time one spends
sedentary and their cognitive function such as lowered mood and depression.[18]
**** Organizational ergonomics[edit] ****
Organizational ergonomics is concerned with the optimization of socio-technical
systems, including their organizational structures, policies, and processes.[5]
(Relevant topics include communication, crew resource management, work design,
work_systems, design of working times, teamwork, participatory_design,
community ergonomics, cooperative work, new work programs, virtual
organizations, telework, and quality management.)
***** History of the field[edit] *****
**** In ancient societies[edit] ****
Some have stated that human ergonomics began with Australopithecus Prometheus
(also known as âlittle footâ), a primate who created handheld tools out of
different types of stone, clearly distinguishing  between tools based on their
ability to perform designated tasks. [19] The foundations of the science of
ergonomics appear to have been laid within the context of the culture of
Ancient_Greece. A good deal of evidence indicates that Greek civilization in
the 5th century BC used ergonomic principles in the design of their tools,
jobs, and workplaces. One outstanding example of this can be found in the
description Hippocrates gave of how a surgeon's workplace should be designed
and how the tools he uses should be arranged.[20] The archaeological_record
also shows that the early Egyptian dynasties made tools and household equipment
that illustrated ergonomic principles.
**** In industrial societies[edit] ****
Bernardino Ramazzini was one of the first people to systematically study the
illness that resulted from work earning himself the nickname âfather of
occupational medicineâ. In the late 1600s and early 1700s Ramazzini visited
many worksites where he documented the movements of laborers and spoke to them
about their ailments. He then published âDe Morbis Artificum Diatribaâ
(italian for Diseases of Workers) which detailed occupations, common illnesses,
remedies. [21]In the 19th century, Frederick_Winslow_Taylor pioneered the
"scientific_management" method, which proposed a way to find the optimum method
of carrying out a given task. Taylor found that he could, for example, triple
the amount of coal that workers were shoveling by incrementally reducing the
size and weight of coal shovels until the fastest shoveling rate was reached.
[22] Frank and Lillian_Gilbreth expanded Taylor's methods in the early 1900s to
develop the "time_and_motion_study". They aimed to improve efficiency by
eliminating unnecessary steps and actions. By applying this approach, the
Gilbreths reduced the number of motions in bricklaying from 18 to 4.5,
[clarification_needed] allowing bricklayers to increase their productivity from
120 to 350 bricks per hour.[22]
However, this approach was rejected by Russian researchers who focused on the
well being of the worker. At the First_Conference_on_Scientific_Organization_of
Labour (1921) Vladimir_Bekhterev and Vladimir_Nikolayevich_Myasishchev
criticised Taylorism. Bekhterev argued that "The ultimate ideal of the labour
problem is not in it [Taylorism], but is in such organisation of the labour
process that would yield a maximum of efficiency coupled with a minimum of
health hazards, absence of fatigue and a guarantee of the sound health and all
round personal development of the working people."[23] Myasishchev rejected
Frederick Taylor's proposal to turn man into a machine. Dull monotonous work
was a temporary necessity until a corresponding machine can be developed. He
also went on to suggest a new discipline of "ergology" to study work as an
integral part of the re-organisation of work. The concept was taken up by
Myasishchev's mentor, Bekhterev, in his final report on the conference, merely
changing the name to "ergonology"[23]
**** In aviation[edit] ****
Prior to World_War I, the focus of aviation psychology was on the aviator
himself, but the war shifted the focus onto the aircraft, in particular, the
design of controls and displays, and the effects of altitude and environmental
factors on the pilot. The war saw the emergence of aeromedical research and the
need for testing and measurement methods. Studies on driver behavior started
gaining momentum during this period, as Henry_Ford started providing millions
of Americans with automobiles. Another major development during this period was
the performance of aeromedical research. By the end of World War I, two
aeronautical labs were established, one at Brooks_Air_Force_Base, Texas and the
other at Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base outside of Dayton,_Ohio. Many tests
were conducted to determine which characteristic differentiated the successful
pilots from the unsuccessful ones. During the early 1930s, Edwin_Link developed
the first flight simulator. The trend continued and more sophisticated
simulators and test equipment were developed. Another significant development
was in the civilian sector, where the effects of illumination on worker
productivity were examined. This led to the identification of the Hawthorne
Effect, which suggested that motivational factors could significantly influence
human performance.[22]
World_War II marked the development of new and complex machines and weaponry,
and these made new demands on operators' cognition. It was no longer possible
to adopt the Tayloristic principle of matching individuals to preexisting jobs.
Now the design of equipment had to take into account human limitations and take
advantage of human capabilities. The decision-making, attention, situational
awareness and hand-eye coordination of the machine's operator became key in the
success or failure of a task. There was substantial research conducted to
determine the human capabilities and limitations that had to be accomplished. A
lot of this research took off where the aeromedical research between the wars
had left off. An example of this is the study done by Fitts and Jones (1947),
who studied the most effective configuration of control knobs to be used in
aircraft cockpits.
Much of this research transcended into other equipment with the aim of making
the controls and displays easier for the operators to use. The entry of the
terms "human factors" and "ergonomics" into the modern lexicon date from this
period. It was observed that fully functional aircraft flown by the best-
trained pilots, still crashed. In 1943 Alphonse_Chapanis, a lieutenant in the
U.S. Army, showed that this so-called "pilot_error" could be greatly reduced
when more logical and differentiable controls replaced confusing designs in
airplane cockpits. After the war, the Army Air Force published 19 volumes
summarizing what had been established from research during the war.[22]
In the decades since World War II, human factors has continued to flourish and
diversify. Work by Elias_Porter and others within the RAND_Corporation after
WWII extended the conception of human factors. "As the thinking progressed, a
new concept developedâthat it was possible to view an organization such as an
air-defense, man-machine system as a single organism and that it was possible
to study the behavior of such an organism. It was the climate for a
breakthrough."[24] In the initial 20 years after the World War II, most
activities were done by the "founding fathers": Alphonse_Chapanis, Paul_Fitts,
and Small.[citation_needed]
**** During the Cold War[edit] ****
The beginning of the Cold_War led to a major expansion of Defense supported
research laboratories. Also, many labs established during WWII started
expanding. Most of the research following the war was military-sponsored. Large
sums of money were granted to universities to conduct research. The scope of
the research also broadened from small equipments to entire workstations and
systems. Concurrently, a lot of opportunities started opening up in the
civilian industry. The focus shifted from research to participation through
advice to engineers in the design of equipment. After 1965, the period saw a
maturation of the discipline. The field has expanded with the development of
the computer and computer applications.[22]
The Space_Age created new human factors issues such as weightlessness and
extreme g-forces. Tolerance of the harsh environment of space and its effects
on the mind and body were widely studied.[25]
**** Information age[edit] ****
The dawn of the Information_Age has resulted in the related field of
humanâcomputer_interaction (HCI). Likewise, the growing demand for and
competition among consumer_goods and electronics has resulted in more companies
and industries including human factors in their product design. Using advanced
technologies in human_kinetics, body-mapping, movement patterns and heat zones,
companies are able to manufacture purpose-specific garments, including full
body suits, jerseys, shorts, shoes, and even underwear.
**** Present-day[edit] ****
Ergonomic evaluation in virtual environment
In physical ergonomics, digital tools and advanced software allow analysis of a
workplace. An employee's movements are recorded using a motion capture tool and
imported into an analyzing system. To detect hazardous postures and movements,
traditional risk assessment methods are implemented in the software â for
example, as in the ViveLab ergonomic assessment software RULA and NASA-OBI.[26]
In virtual space, a biomechanically accurate model represents the worker. The
body structure, sex, age and demographic group of the mannequin is adjustable
to correspond to the properties of the employee. The software provides several
different evaluations such as reachability test, spaghetti_diagram, or
visibility analysis.[27] With these tools, ergonomists are able to redesign a
workstation in a virtual environment and test it in iterations until the result
is satisfactory.
***** Human factors organizations[edit] *****
Formed in 1946 in the UK, the oldest professional body for human factors
specialists and ergonomists is The_Chartered_Institute_of_Ergonomics_and_Human
Factors, formally known as the Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors and
before that, The Ergonomics Society.
The Human_Factors_and_Ergonomics_Society (HFES) was founded in 1957. The
Society's mission is to promote the discovery and exchange of knowledge
concerning the characteristics of human beings that are applicable to the
design of systems and devices of all kinds.
The Association_of_Canadian_Ergonomists_-_l'Association_canadienne_d'ergonomie
(ACE) was founded in 1968.[28] It was originally named the Human Factors
Association of Canada (HFAC), with ACE (in French) added in 1984, and the
consistent, bilingual title adopted in 1999. According to it 2017 mission
statement, ACE unites and advances the knowledge and skills of ergonomics and
human factors practitioners to optimise human and organisational well-being.
[29]
The International_Ergonomics_Association (IEA) is a federation of ergonomics
and human factors societies from around the world. The mission of the IEA is to
elaborate and advance ergonomics science and practice, and to improve the
quality of life by expanding its scope of application and contribution to
society. As of September 2008, the International Ergonomics Association has 46
federated societies and 2 affiliated societies.
**** Related organizations[edit] ****
The Institute_of_Occupational_Medicine (IOM) was founded by the coal industry
in 1969. From the outset the IOM employed an ergonomics staff to apply
ergonomics principles to the design of mining machinery and environments. To
this day, the IOM continues ergonomics activities, especially in the fields of
musculoskeletal_disorders; heat stress and the ergonomics of personal
protective_equipment (PPE). Like many in occupational ergonomics, the demands
and requirements of an ageing UK workforce are a growing concern and interest
to IOM ergonomists.
The International Society_of_Automotive_Engineers (SAE) is a professional
organization for mobility engineering professionals in the aerospace,
automotive, and commercial vehicle industries. The Society is a standards
development organization for the engineering of powered vehicles of all kinds,
including cars, trucks, boats, aircraft, and others. The Society of Automotive
Engineers has established a number of standards used in the automotive industry
and elsewhere. It encourages the design of vehicles in accordance with
established human factors principles. It is one of the most influential
organizations with respect to ergonomics work in automotive_design. This
society regularly holds conferences which address topics spanning all aspects
of human factors and ergonomics.[citation_needed]
***** Practitioners[edit] *****
Human factors practitioners come from a variety of backgrounds, though
predominantly they are psychologists (from the various subfields of industrial
and_organizational_psychology, engineering_psychology, cognitive_psychology,
perceptual_psychology, applied_psychology, and experimental_psychology) and
physiologists. Designers (industrial, interaction, and graphic),
anthropologists, technical communication scholars and computer scientists also
contribute. Typically, an ergonomist will have an undergraduate_degree in
psychology, engineering, design or health_sciences, and usually a master's
degree or doctoral_degree in a related discipline. Though some practitioners
enter the field of human factors from other disciplines, both M.S. and PhD
degrees in Human Factors Engineering are available from several universities
worldwide.
****** Ergonomics and the Sedentary Workplace[edit] ******
Contemporary offices did not exist until the 1830s [30] with, Wojciech
JastrzÄbowskâs seminal book on MSDergonomics following in 1857 [31] and the
first published study of posture appearing in 1955s [32]
As the American workforce began to shift towards sedentary employment, the
prevalence of [WMSD/cognitive issues/ etc..] began to rise. In 1900, 41% of the
US workforce was employed in agriculture but by 2000 that had dropped to 1.9%
[33] This coincides with an increase in growth in desk-based employment (25% of
all employment in 2000) [34] and the surveillance of non-fatal workplace
injuries by OSHA and Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1971[35] .0-1.5 and occurs
in a sitting or reclining position. Adults older than 50 years report spending
more time sedentary and for adults older than 65 years this is often 80% of
their awake time. Multiple studies show a dose-response relationship between
sedentary time and all-cause mortality with an increase of 3% mortality per
additional sedentary hour each day.[36] High quantities of sedentary time
without breaks is correlated to higher risk of chronic disease, obesity,
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer.[18]
Currently, there is a large proportion of the overall workforce who is employed
in low physical activity occupations.[37] Sedentary behavior, such as spending
long periods of time in seated positions poses a serious threat for injuries
and additional health risks.[38] Unfortunately, even though some workplaces
make an effort to provide a well designed environment for sedentary employees,
any employee who is performing large amounts of sitting will likely suffer
discomfort.[38] There are existing conditions that would predispose both
individuals and populations to an increase in prevalence of living sedentary
lifestyles, including: socioeconomic determinants, education levels,
occupation, living environment, age (as mentioned above) and more.[39] A study
published by the Iranian Journal of Public Health examined socioeconomic
factors and sedentary lifestyle effects for individuals in a working community.
The study concluded that individuals who reported living in low income
environments were more inclined to living sedentary behavior compared to those
who reported being of high socioeconomic status.[39] Individuals who achieve
less education are also considered to be a high risk group to partake in
sedentary lifestyles, however, each community is different and has different
resources available that may vary this risk.[39] Often times, larger worksites
are associated with increased occupational sitting.Those who work in
environments that are classified as business and office jobs are typically more
exposed to sitting and sedentary behavior while in the workplace. Additionally,
occupations that are full-time, have schedule flexibility, are also included in
that demographic, and are more likely to sit often throughout their workday.
[40]
Ergonomics Policy Implementation:
Obstacles surrounding better ergonomic features to sedentary employees include
cost, time, effort and for both companies and employees. The evidence above
helps establish the importance of ergonomics in a sedentary workplace; however
missing information from this problem is enforcement and policy implementation.
 As a modernized workplace becomes more and more technology based more jobs are
becoming primarily seated, therefore leading to a need to prevent chronic
injuries and pain. This is becoming easier with the amount of research around
ergonomic tools saving money companies by limiting the number of days missed
from work and workers comp cases [41]. The way to ensure that corporations
prioritize these health outcomes for their employees is through policy and
implementation[41] .
Nationwide there are no policies that are currently in place, however a handful
of big companies and states have taken on cultural policies to insure the
safety of all workers.  For example, the state of Nevada risk management
department has established a set of ground rules for both agencies
responsibilities and employees responsibilities [42]. The agency
responsibilities include evaluating workstations, using risk management
resources when necessary and keeping OSHA records [42]. To see specific
workstation ergonomic policies and responsibilities click here [43].
***** Methods[edit] *****
Until recently, methods used to evaluate human factors and ergonomics ranged
from simple questionnaires to more complex and expensive usability labs.[44]
Some of the more common human factors methods are listed below:
    * Ethnographic analysis: Using methods derived from ethnography, this
      process focuses on observing the uses of technology in a practical
      environment. It is a qualitative and observational method that focuses on
      "real-world" experience and pressures, and the usage of technology or
      environments in the workplace. The process is best used early in the
      design process.[45]
    * Focus_Groups are another form of qualitative research in which one
      individual will facilitate discussion and elicit opinions about the
      technology or process under investigation. This can be on a one-to-one
      interview basis, or in a group session. Can be used to gain a large
      quantity of deep qualitative data,[46] though due to the small sample
      size, can be subject to a higher degree of individual bias.[47] Can be
      used at any point in the design process, as it is largely dependent on
      the exact questions to be pursued, and the structure of the group. Can be
      extremely costly.
    * Iterative_design: Also known as prototyping, the iterative design process
      seeks to involve users at several stages of design, to correct problems
      as they emerge. As prototypes emerge from the design process, these are
      subjected to other forms of analysis as outlined in this article, and the
      results are then taken and incorporated into the new design. Trends among
      users are analyzed, and products redesigned. This can become a costly
      process, and needs to be done as soon as possible in the design process
      before designs become too concrete.[45]
    * Meta-analysis: A supplementary technique used to examine a wide body of
      already existing data or literature to derive trends or form hypotheses
      to aid design decisions. As part of a literature survey, a meta-analysis
      can be performed to discern a collective trend from individual variables.
      [47]
    * Subjects-in-tandem: Two subjects are asked to work concurrently on a
      series of tasks while vocalizing their analytical observations. The
      technique is also known as "Co-Discovery" as participants tend to feed
      off of each other's comments to generate a richer set of observations
      than is often possible with the participants separately. This is observed
      by the researcher, and can be used to discover usability difficulties.
      This process is usually recorded.[citation_needed]
    * Surveys and questionnaires: A commonly used technique outside of human
      factors as well, surveys and questionnaires have an advantage in that
      they can be administered to a large group of people for relatively low
      cost, enabling the researcher to gain a large amount of data. The
      validity of the data obtained is, however, always in question, as the
      questions must be written and interpreted correctly, and are, by
      definition, subjective. Those who actually respond are in effect self-
      selecting as well, widening the gap between the sample and the population
      further.[47]
    * Task_analysis: A process with roots in activity_theory, task analysis is
      a way of systematically describing human interaction with a system or
      process to understand how to match the demands of the system or process
      to human capabilities. The complexity of this process is generally
      proportional to the complexity of the task being analyzed, and so can
      vary in cost and time involvement. It is a qualitative and observational
      process. Best used early in the design process.[47]
    * Think_aloud_protocol: Also known as "concurrent verbal protocol", this is
      the process of asking a user to execute a series of tasks or use
      technology, while continuously verbalizing their thoughts so that a
      researcher can gain insights as to the users' analytical process. Can be
      useful for finding design flaws that do not affect task performance, but
      may have a negative cognitive effect on the user. Also useful for
      utilizing experts to better understand procedural knowledge of the task
      in question. Less expensive than focus groups, but tends to be more
      specific and subjective.[48]
    * User_analysis: This process is based around designing for the attributes
      of the intended user or operator, establishing the characteristics that
      define them, creating a persona for the user. Best done at the outset of
      the design process, a user analysis will attempt to predict the most
      common users, and the characteristics that they would be assumed to have
      in common. This can be problematic if the design concept does not match
      the actual user, or if the identified are too vague to make clear design
      decisions from. This process is, however, usually quite inexpensive, and
      commonly used.[47]
    * "Wizard of Oz": This is a comparatively uncommon technique but has seen
      some use in mobile devices. Based upon the Wizard_of_Oz_experiment, this
      technique involves an operator who remotely controls the operation of a
      device to imitate the response of an actual computer program. It has the
      advantage of producing a highly changeable set of reactions, but can be
      quite costly and difficult to undertake.
    * Methods analysis is the process of studying the tasks a worker completes
      using a step-by-step investigation. Each task in broken down into smaller
      steps until each motion the worker performs is described. Doing so
      enables you to see exactly where repetitive or straining tasks occur.
    * Time studies determine the time required for a worker to complete each
      task. Time studies are often used to analyze cyclical jobs. They are
      considered "event based" studies because time measurements are triggered
      by the occurrence of predetermined events.[49]
    * Work_sampling is a method in which the job is sampled at random intervals
      to determine the proportion of total time spent on a particular task.[49]
      It provides insight into how often workers are performing tasks which
      might cause strain on their bodies.
    * Predetermined_time_systems are methods for analyzing the time spent by
      workers on a particular task. One of the most widely used predetermined
      time system is called Methods-Time-Measurement (MTM). Other common work
      measurement systems include MODAPTS and MOST. Industry specific
      applications based on PTS are Seweasy,MODAPTS and GSD as seen in paper:
      Miller, Doug, Towards Sustainable Labour Costing in UK Fashion Retail (5
      February 2013). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2212100 or
      doi:10.2139/ssrn.2212100 .[citation_needed]
    * Cognitive_walkthrough: This method is a usability_inspection method in
      which the evaluators can apply user perspective to task scenarios to
      identify design problems. As applied to macroergonomics, evaluators are
      able to analyze the usability of work system designs to identify how well
      a work system is organized and how well the workflow is integrated.[50]
    * Kansei_method: This is a method that transforms consumer's responses to
      new products into design specifications. As applied to macroergonomics,
      this method can translate employee's responses to changes to a work
      system into design specifications.[50]
    * High Integration of Technology, Organization, and People (HITOP): This is
      a manual procedure done step-by-step to apply technological change to the
      workplace. It allows managers to be more aware of the human and
      organizational aspects of their technology plans, allowing them to
      efficiently integrate technology in these contexts.[50]
    * Top modeler: This model helps manufacturing companies identify the
      organizational changes needed when new technologies are being considered
      for their process.[50]
    * Computer-integrated Manufacturing, Organization, and People System Design
      (CIMOP): This model allows for evaluating computer-integrated
      manufacturing, organization, and people system design based on knowledge
      of the system.[50]
    * Anthropotechnology: This method considers analysis and design
      modification of systems for the efficient transfer of technology from one
      culture to another.[50]
    * Systems_analysis tool (SAT): This is a method to conduct systematic
      trade-off evaluations of work-system intervention alternatives.[50]
    * Macroergonomic analysis of structure (MAS): This method analyzes the
      structure of work systems according to their compatibility with unique
      sociotechnical aspects.[50]
    * Macroergonomic analysis and design (MEAD): This method assesses work-
      system processes by using a ten-step process.[50]
    * Virtual manufacturing and response surface methodology (VMRSM): This
      method uses computerized tools and statistical analysis for workstation
      design.[51]
**** Weaknesses[edit] ****
Problems related to measures of usability include the fact that measures of
learning and retention of how to use an interface are rarely employed and some
studies treat measures of how users interact with interfaces as synonymous with
quality-in-use, despite an unclear relation.[52]
Although field methods can be extremely useful because they are conducted in
the users' natural environment, they have some major limitations to consider.
The limitations include:
   1. Usually take more time and resources than other methods
   2. Very high effort in planning, recruiting, and executing compared with
      other methods
   3. Much longer study periods and therefore requires much goodwill among the
      participants
   4. Studies are longitudinal in nature, therefore, attrition can become a
      problem.[53]
