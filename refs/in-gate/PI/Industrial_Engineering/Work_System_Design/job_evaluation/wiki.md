A job evaluation is a systematic way of determining the value/worth of a job in
relation to other jobs in an organization. It tries to make a systematic
comparison between jobs to assess their relative worth for the purpose of
establishing a rational pay structure. Job evaluation needs to be
differentiated from job_analysis. Job analysis is a systematic way of gathering
information about a job. Every job evaluation method requires at least some
basic job analysis in order to provide factual information about the jobs
concerned. Thus, job evaluation begins with job analysis and ends at that point
where the worth of a job is ascertained for achieving pay_equity between jobs
and different roles.

***** Process[edit] *****
The process of job evaluation involves the following steps:
    * Gaining acceptance: Before undertaking job evaluation, top management
      must explain the aims and uses of the programme to managers, emphasizing
      the benefits. Employees and unions may be consulted, depending on the
      legal and employee relations environment and company culture. To
      elaborate the program further, presentations could be made to explain the
      inputs, process and outputs/benefits of job evaluation.
    * Creating job evaluation committee: It is not possible for a single person
      to evaluate all the key jobs in an organization. Often a job evaluation
      committee consisting of experienced employees, union representatives and
      HR experts is created to set the ball rolling.
    * Finding the jobs to be evaluated: Every job need not be evaluated. This
      may be too taxing and costly. Certain key jobs in each department may be
      identified. While picking up the jobs, care must be taken to ensure that
      they represent the type of work performed in that department, at various
      levels.
    * Analysing and preparing job_description: This requires the preparation of
      a job_description and also an analysis of job specifications for
      successful performance. See job_analysis.
    * Selecting the method of evaluation: The method of evaluating jobs must be
      identified, keeping the job factors as well as organisational demands in
      mind. Selecting a method also involves consideration of company culture,
      and the capacity of the compensation and benefits function or job
      evaluation committee.
    * Evaluating jobs: The relative worth of various jobs in an organisation
      may be determined by applying the job evaluation method. The method may
      consider the "whole job" by ranking a set of jobs, or by comparing each
      job to a general level description. Factor-based methods require
      consideration of the level of various compensable factors (criteria) such
      as level and breadth of responsibility, knowledge and skill required,
      complexity, impact, accountability, working conditions, etc. These factor
      comparisons can be one with or without numerical scoring. If there is
      numerical scoring, weights can be assigned to each such factor and scores
      are associated with different levels of each factor, so that a total
      score is determined for the job. All methods result in an assigned grade
      level.
**** Installing the programme[edit] ****
Once the evaluation process is over and a plan of action is ready, management
must explain it to employees and put it into operation.
**** Reviewing periodically[edit] ****
In the light of changes in environmental conditions (technology, products,
services, etc.) jobs need to be examined closely. For example, the traditional
clerical functions have undergone a rapid change in sectors like banking,
insurance and railways, after computerisation. New job descriptions need to be
written and the skill needs of new jobs need to be duly incorporated in the
evaluation process. Otherwise, employees may feel that all the relevant job
factors - based on which their pay has been determined - have not been
evaluated properly.
For job evaluation to be practicable it is necessary:
    * that jobs can be easily identified
    * that there are sufficient differences between different jobs; and
    * that agreements know the relative importance or worth of different jobs
      can be negotiated between the enterprise and its employees and/or their
      representatives.
***** Methods[edit] *****
There are primarily three methods of job evaluation: (1) ranking, (2)
classification, (3) Factor comparison method or Point method. While many
variations of these methods exist in practice, the three basic approaches are
described here.
**** Ranking method[edit] ****
Perhaps the simplest method of job evaluation is the ranking method. According
to this method, jobs are arranged from highest to lowest, in order of their
value or merit to the organization. Jobs can also be arranged according to the
relative difficulty in performing them. The jobs are examined as a whole rather
than on the basis of important factors in the job; the job at the top of the
list has the highest value and obviously the job at the bottom of the list will
have the lowest value. Jobs are usually ranked in each department and then the
department rankings are combined to develop an organizational ranking. The
variation in payment of salaries depends on the variation of the nature of the
job performed by the employees. The ranking method is simple to understand and
practice and it is best suited for a small organization. Its simplicity however
works to its disadvantage in big organizations because rankings are difficult
to develop in a large, complex organization. Moreover, this kind of ranking is
highly subjective in nature and may offend many employees. Therefore, a more
scientific and fruitful way of job evaluation is called for.
**** Classification method (Grading method)[edit] ****
According to this method, a predetermined number of job groups or job classes
are established and jobs are assigned to these classifications. This method
places groups of jobs into job classes or job grades. Separate classes may
include office, clerical, managerial, personnel, etc. Following is a brief
description of such a classification in an office.
    * Class I - Executives: Further classification under this category may be
      Office Manager, Deputy office manager, Office superintendent,
      Departmental supervisor, etc.
    * Class II - Skilled workers: Under this category may come the Purchasing
      assistant, Cashier, Receipts clerk, etc.
    * Class III - Semiskilled workers: Under this category may come
      Stenotypists, Machine-operators, Switchboard operator etc.
    * Class IV - Unskilled workers: This category may comprise peons,
      messengers, housekeeping staff, Daftaris[clarification_needed], File
      clerks, Office boys, etc.
The job grading method is less subjective when compared to the earlier ranking
method. The system is very easy to understand and acceptable to almost all
employees without hesitation. One strong point in favour of the method is that
it takes into account all the factors that a job comprises. This system can be
effectively used for a variety of jobs. The weaknesses of the Grading method
are:
    * Even when the requirements of different jobs differ, they may be combined
      into a single category, depending on the status a job carries.
    * It is difficult to write all-inclusive descriptions of a grade.
    * The method oversimplifies sharp differences between different jobs and
      different grades.
    * When individual job descriptions and grade descriptions do not match
      well, the evaluators have the tendency to classify the job using their
      subjective judgements.
**** Factor comparison method or Point method[edit] ****
This method is widely used and is considered to be one of the reliable and
systematic approach for job evaluation in mid and large size organisations.
Most consulting firms adopt this method, which was pioneered by Edward_Hay in
1943. Here, jobs are expressed in terms of key factors. Points are assigned to
each factor after prioritizing each factor in order of importance. The points
are summed up to determine the wage rate for the job. Jobs with similar point
totals are placed in similar pay grades. The procedure involved may be
explained thus:
1. Select key jobs. Identify the factors common to all the identified jobs such
as skill, effort, responsibility, etc.
2. Divide each major factor into a number of sub factors. Each sub factor is
defined and expressed clearly in the order of importance, preferably along a
scale.
The most frequent factors employed in point systems are:
(i) Skill (key factor); Education and training required, Breadth/depth of
experience required, Social skills required, Problem-solving skills, Degree of
discretion/use of judgment, Creative thinking
(ii) Responsibility/Accountability: Breadth of responsibility, Specialized
responsibility, Complexity of the work, Degree of freedom to act, Number and
nature of subordinate staff, Extent of accountability for equipment/plant,
Extent of accountability for product/materials;
(iii) Effort: Mental demands of a job, Physical demands of a job, Degree of
potential stress
The educational requirements (sub factor) under the skill (key factor) may be
expressed thus in the order of importance.
3. Find the maximum number of points assigned to each job (after adding up the
point values of all sub-factors of such a job).
This would help in finding the relative worth of a job. For instance, the
maximum points assigned to an officer's job in a bank come to 540. The
manager's job, after adding up key factors + sub factors points, may be getting
a point value of say 650 from the job evaluation committee. This job is now
priced at a higher level.
4. Once the worth of a job in terms of total points is expressed, the points
are converted into money values keeping in view the hourly/daily wage rates. A
wage survey is usually undertaken to collect wage rates of certain key jobs in
the organization.
**** Market Pricing[edit] ****
Market pricing is the process for determining the external value of jobs,
allowing you to establish wage and salary structures and pay rates that are
market sensitive. Job matching session is conducted.
***** Merits and demerits[edit] *****
The point method is a superior and widely used method of evaluating jobs. It
forces raters to look into all key factors and sub-factors of a job. Point
values are assigned to all factors in a systematic way, eliminating bias at
every stage. It is reliable because raters using similar criteria would get
more or less similar answers. The methodology underlying the approach
contributes to a minimum of rating error (Robbins p. 361). It accounts for
differences in wage rates for various jobs on the strength of job factors. Jobs
may change over time, but the rating scales established under the point method
remain unaffected. On the negative side, the point method is complex. Preparing
a manual for various jobs, fixing values for key and sub-factors, establishing
wage rates for different grades, etc., is a time consuming process, According
to Decenzo and Robbins, "the key criteria must be carefully and clearly
identified, degrees of factors have to be agreed upon in terms that mean the
same to all rates, the weight of each criterion has to be established and point
values must be assigned to degrees". This may be too taxing, especially while
evaluating managerial jobs where the nature of work (varied, complex, novel) is
such that it cannot be expressed in quantifiable numbers.

***** Concept of job evaluation[edit] *****
What is job design? As we just explained, job analysis provides job-related
data as well as the skills and knowledge required for the incumbent to perform
the job. A better job performance also requires deciding on sequence of job
contents. This is called 'job_design'. Job design is a logical sequence to job
analysis. In other words, job design involves specifying the contents of a job,
the work methods used in its performance and how the job relates to other jobs
in the organisation.
A few definitions on job design are produced here with a view to help you
understand the meaning of job design in a better manner. Michael Armstrong11
has defined job design as "the process of deciding on the contents of a job in
terms of its duties and responsibilities, on the methods to be used in carrying
out the job, in terms of techniques, systems and procedures, and on the
relationships that should exist between the job holder and his superiors,
subordinates and colleagues".
Mathis and Jackson I2 have defined job design as "a process that integrates
work content (tasks, functions, relationships), the rewards(extrinsic and
intrinsic), and the qualifications required (skills, knowledge, abilities) for
each job in a way that meets the needs of employees and organisations."
Popplewell and Wildsmith13 define job design in these words: "......involves
conscious efforts to organise tasks, duties, and responsibilities into a unit
of work to achieve certain objectives".
Having gone through the above definitions of job design, it can now be
described as a deliberate attempt made to structure both technical and social
aspects of the job to attain a fit between the individual (job holder) and the
job. The very idea is that job should be designed in such a way as to enable
employees to control over the aspects of their work. The underlying
justification being that by doing this, it enhances the quality of the work
life, harnesses the potential of the workers in a more effective manner and
thereby improves employee performance.
***** Techniques for designing jobs[edit] *****
Basically, there are four techniques used in the design of jobs. These include
Job simplification, Job_enlargement, Job_enrichment and Job_rotation.
**** Job simplification[edit] ****
Job simplification is a design method whereby jobs are divided into smaller
components and subsequently assigned to workers as whole jobs. Simplification
of work requires that jobs be broken down into their smallest units and then
analysed. Each resulting sub-unit typically consists of relatively few
operations. These subunits are then assigned to the workers as their total job.
Many fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, Burger_King and KFC use
simplification because employees can learn tasks rapidly; short work cycles
allow task performance with little or no mental effort and low-skilled and low-
paid employees can be hired and trained easily.
On the negative side, job simplification results in workers experiencing
boredom, frustration, alienation, lack of motivation and low job_satisfaction.
This, in turn, leads to lower productivity and increased cost.
**** Job enlargement[edit] ****
Job enlargement expands a job horizontally. It increases job scope; that is, it
increases the number of different operations required in a job and the
frequency with which the job cycle is repeated. By increasing the number of
tasks an individual performs, job enlargement increases the job scope, or job
diversity. Instead of only sorting the incoming mail by department, for
instance, a mail sorter's job could be enlarged to include physically
delivering the mail to the various departments or running outgoing letters
through the postage meter.
Efforts at job enlargement have met with less than enthusiastic results. As one
employee who experienced such a redesign on his job remarked, "Before I had one
lousy job. Now, through enlargement, I have three!" So while job enlargement
attacks the lack of diversity in overspecialised jobs, it has done little to
provide challenge or meaningfulness to a worker's activities.
**** Job rotation[edit] ****
Job rotation refers to the movement of an employee from one job to another.
Jobs themselves are not actually changed, only the employees are rotated among
various jobs. An employee who works on a routine job moves to work on another
job for some hours/days/months and returns to the first job. This measure
relieves the employee from the boredom and monotony, improves the employee's
skills regarding various jobs and prepares worker's self-image and provides
personal_growth. However, frequent job rotations are not advisable in view of
their negative impact on the organisation and the employee.
**** Job enrichment[edit] ****
Job enrichment, as currently practiced in industry, is a direct outgrowth of
Herzberg's Two Factor Theory of motivation. It is, therefore, based on the
assumption that in order to motivate personnel, the job itself must provide
opportunities for achievement recognition, responsibility, advancement and
growth. The basic idea is to restore to jobs the elements of interest that were
taken away under intensive specialisation. Job enrichment tries to embellish
the job with factors that Herzberg characterised as motivators: achievement,
recognition, increased responsibilities, opportunities for growth, advancement
and increased competence. There is an attempt to build into jobs a higher sense
of challenge and achievement, through vertical job loading. 6 Job enrichment
has four unique aspects:
    * It changes the basic relationship between employees and their work.
      Interesting and challenging work, as studies have proved, can be a source
      of employee satisfaction.
    * It changes employee behaviours in ways that gradually lead to more
      positive attitudes about the organisation and a better self-image.
      Feeling of autonomy and personal freedom help employees view their jobs
      in a favourable way.
    * It helps the employer to bring about organisational changes easily,
      securing employee cooperation and commitment.
    * Job enrichment can humanise an organisation. 'Individuals can experience
      the psychological that comes from developing new competencies and doing a
      job well. Individuals are encouraged to grow and push themselves.'
