Industrial engineering is an engineering profession that is concerned with the
optimization of complex processes, systems, or organizations by developing,
improving and implementing integrated systems of people, money, knowledge,
information, equipment, energy and materials[1].
Industrial engineers use specialized knowledge and skills in the mathematical,
physical, and social sciences, together with the principles and methods of
engineering analysis and design, to specify, predict, and evaluate the results
obtained from systems and processes[1]. From these results, they are able to
create new systems, processes or situations for the useful coordination of
labour, materials and machines and also improve the quality and productivity of
systems, physical or social[2][3]. Depending on the sub-specialties involved,
industrial engineering may also overlap with, operations_research, systems
engineering, manufacturing_engineering, production_engineering, management
science, management_engineering, financial_engineering, ergonomics or human
factors_engineering, safety_engineering, or others, depending on the viewpoint
or motives of the user.
Even though its underlying concepts overlap considerably with certain business-
oriented disciplines, such as operations_management, industrial engineering is
a longstanding engineering discipline subject to (and eligible for)
professional_engineering licensure in most jurisdictions.

**** Origins[edit] ****
*** Industrial Revolution[edit] ***
There is a general consensus among historians that the roots of the industrial
engineering profession date back to the Industrial_Revolution. The technologies
that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry
including the flying_shuttle, the spinning_jenny, and perhaps most importantly
the steam_engine generated economies_of_scale that made Mass_production in
centralized locations attractive for the first time. The concept of the
production system had its genesis in the factories created by these
innovations.[4]
*** Specialization of labor[edit] ***
Watt's steam engine (Technical_University_of_Madrid)
Adam Smith's concepts of Division_of_Labour and the "Invisible Hand" of
capitalism introduced in his treatise "The_Wealth_of_Nations" motivated many of
the technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and
implement factory systems. The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to
the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the
implementation of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and
increase productivity and the institution of skills training for craftsmen.[4]
Charles_Babbage became associated with Industrial engineering because of the
concepts he introduced in his book "On the Economy of Machinery and
Manufacturers" which he wrote as a result of his visits to factories in England
and the United States in the early 1800s. The book includes subjects such as
the time required to perform a specific task, the effects of subdividing tasks
into smaller and less detailed elements, and the advantages to be gained from
repetitive tasks.[4]
*** Interchangeable parts[edit] ***
Eli_Whitney and Simeon_North proved the feasibility of the notion of
Interchangeable_parts in the manufacture of muskets and pistols for the US
Government. Under this system, individual parts were mass-produced to
tolerances to enable their use in any finished product. The result was a
significant reduction in the need for skill from specialized workers, which
eventually led to the industrial environment to be studied later.[4]
**** Pioneers[edit] ****
Frederick_Taylor (1856 â 1915) is generally credited as being the father of
the Industrial Engineering discipline. He earned a degree in mechanical
engineering from Steven's University and earned several patents from his
inventions. His books, Shop Management and The_Principles_of_Scientific
Management which were published in the early 1900s, were the beginning of
Industrial Engineering.[5] Improvements in work efficiency under his methods
was based on improving work methods, developing of work standards, and
reduction in time required to carry out the work. With an abiding faith in the
scientific method, Taylor's contribution to "Time Study" sought a high level of
precision and predictability for manual tasks.[4]
The husband-and-wife team of Frank_Gilbreth (1868 â 1924) and Lillian
Gilbreth (1878 â 1972) was the other cornerstone of the Industrial
Engineering movement whose work is housed at Purdue University School of
Industrial Engineering. They categorized the elements of human motion into 18
basic elements called therbligs. This development permitted analysts to design
jobs without knowledge of the time required to do a job. These developments
were the beginning of a much broader field known as human factors or
ergonomics.[4]
In 1908, the first course on Industrial Engineering was offered as an elective
at Pennsylvania_State_University, which became a separate program in 1909
through the efforts of Hugo_Diemer.[6] The first doctoral degree in industrial
engineering was awarded in 1933 by Cornell_University.
In 1912 Henry_Laurence_Gantt developed the Gantt_chart which outlines actions
the organization along with their relationships. This chart opens later form
familiar to us today by Wallace_Clark.
With the development of assembly_lines, the factory of Henry_Ford (1913)
accounted for a significant leap forward in the field. Ford reduced the
assembly time of a car more than 700 hours to 1.5 hours. In addition, he was a
pioneer of the economy of the capitalist welfare ("welfare capitalism") and the
flag of providing financial incentives for employees to increase productivity.
Comprehensive quality management system (Total_quality_management or TQM)
developed in the forties was gaining momentum after World War II and was part
of the recovery of Japan after the war.
The American_Institute_of_Industrial_Engineering was formed in 1948. The early
work by F. W. Taylor and the Gilbreths was documented in papers presented to
the American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers as interest grew from merely
improving machine performance to the performance of the overall manufacturing
process; most notably starting with the presentation by Henry_R._Towne (1844 -
1924) of his paper The Engineer as An Economist (1186).[7]
**** Modern practice[edit] ****
In 1960 to 1975, with the development of decision support systems in supply
such as the Material_requirements_planning (MRP), you can emphasize the timing
issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial
organization. Israeli scientist Dr. Jacob_Rubinovitz installed the CMMS program
developed in IAI and Control-Data (Israel) in 1976 in South Africa and
worldwide.
In the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as
Kaizen and Kanban, Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity.
These theories improved issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility.
Companies in the west realized the great impact of Kaizen and started
implementing their own Continuous_improvement programs.
In the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the
emphasis was on supply chain management and customer-oriented business process
design. Theory_of_constraints developed by an Israeli scientist Eliyahu_M.
Goldratt (1985) is also a significant milestone in the field.
**** Compared to other engineering disciplines[edit] ****
Engineering is traditionally decompositional. To understand the whole, it is
first broken into its parts. One then masters the parts and puts them back
together, becoming the master of the whole. Industrial and systems
engineering's (ISE) approach is the opposite; any one part cannot be understood
without the context of the whole. Changes in one part affect the whole, and the
role of a part is a projection into the whole. In traditional engineering,
people understand the parts first, then they can understand the whole. In ISE,
they understand the whole first, and then they can understand the role of each
part.
Also, Industrial engineering considers the human factor and its relation to the
technical aspect of the situation and the all of the other factors that
influence the entire situation[3], while other engineering disciplines focus on
the design of inanimate objects.
"Industrial Engineers integrate combinations of people, information, materials,
and equipment that produce innovative and efficient organizations. In addition
to manufacturing, Industrial Engineers work and consult in every industry,
including hospitals, communications, e-commerce, entertainment, government,
finance, food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, sports, insurance, sales,
accounting, banking, travel, and transportation."[8]
"Industrial Engineering is the branch of Engineering most closely related to
human resources in that we apply social skills to work with all types of
employees, from engineers to salespeople to top management. One of the main
focuses of an Industrial Engineer is to improve the working environments of
people â not to change the worker, but to change the workplace."[8]
"All engineers, including Industrial Engineers, take mathematics through
calculus and differential equations. Industrial Engineering is different in
that it is based on discrete variable math, whereas all other engineering is
based on continuous variable math. We emphasize the use of linear algebra and
difference equations, as opposed to the use of differential equations which are
so prevalent in other engineering disciplines. This emphasis becomes evident in
optimization of production systems in which we are sequencing orders,
scheduling batches, determining the number of materials handling units,
arranging factory layouts, finding sequences of motions, etc. As, Industrial
Engineers, we deal almost exclusively with systems of discrete components."[8]

**** Etymology[edit] ****
While originally applied to manufacturing, the use of "industrial" in
"industrial engineering" can be somewhat misleading, since it has grown to
encompass any methodical or quantitative approach to optimizing how a process,
system, or organization operates. In fact, the "Industrial" in Industrial
engineering means the "industry" in its broadest sense.[9] People have changed
the term "industrial" to broader terms such as Industrial and Manufacturing
Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Industrial Engineering &
Operations Research, Industrial Engineering & Management.
***** Sub-disciplines[edit] *****
Industrial engineering has many sub-disciplines, the most common of which are
listed below. Although there are industrial engineers who focus exclusively on
one of these sub-disciplines, many deal with a combination of them such as
Supply Chain and Logistics, and Facilities and Energy Management.[10][11]

***** Education[edit] *****
Industrial engineers study the interaction of human beings with machines,
materials, information, procedures and environments in such developments and in
designing a technological system.[12]
Universities offer degrees at the bachelor, masters, and doctoral level.

In the United States, the undergraduate degree earned is the bachelor of
science (B.S.) or bachelor of science and engineering (B.S.E.) in industrial
engineering (IE). Variations of the title include Industrial & Operations
Engineering (IOE), and Industrial & Systems Engineering (ISE). The typical
curriculum includes a broad math and science foundation spanning chemistry,
physics, mechanics (i.e., statics, kinematics, and dynamics), materials
science, computer_science, electronics/circuits, engineering_design, and the
standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e., calculus, linear_algebra,
differential_equations, statistics). For any engineering undergraduate program
to be accredited, regardless of concentration, it must cover a largely similar
span of such foundational work - which also overlaps heavily with the content
tested on one or more engineering licensure exams in most jurisdictions.
The coursework specific to IE entails specialized courses in areas such as
optimization, applied_probability, stochastic modeling, design_of_experiments,
statistical_process_control, simulation, manufacturing_engineering, ergonomics/
safety_engineering, and engineering_economics. Industrial engineering elective
courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as manufacturing,
supply_chains and logistics, analytics and machine_learning, production
systems, human_factors and industrial_design, and service_systems.[14][15][16]
[17][18]
Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to
IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely
quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math
and science courses required of all engineering programs.

**** Differences in teaching[edit] ****
While industrial engineering as a formal degree has been around for years,
consensus on what topics should be taught and studied differs across countries.
For example, Turkey focuses on a very technical degree while Denmark, Finland
and the United Kingdom have a management focus degree, thus making it less
technical. The United States focuses on case-studies and group problem solving.
[20]
***** Practicing engineers[edit] *****
Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was planning_the
layouts_of_factories and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing
paradigms. And now, in lean_manufacturing systems, industrial engineers work to
eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources.
Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process
charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for
various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a
new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and
emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution
schemes for materials or products (referred to as supply-chain_management), and
shortening lines (or queues) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.
Modern industrial engineers typically use predetermined_motion_time_system,
computer_simulation (especially discrete_event_simulation), along with
extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as mathematical_optimization
and queueing_theory, and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation,
and optimization. Industrial engineers also use the tools of data_science and
machine_learning in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these
disciplines with the field and the similar technical background required of
industrial engineers (including a strong foundation in probability_theory,
linear_algebra, and statistics, as well as having coding skills).
