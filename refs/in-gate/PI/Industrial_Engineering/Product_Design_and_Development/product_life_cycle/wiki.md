A generic lifecycle of products
In industry, product lifecycle management (PLM) is the process of managing the
entire lifecycle of a product from inception, through engineering design and
manufacture, to service and disposal of manufactured products.[1][2] PLM
integrates people, data, processes and business systems and provides a product
information backbone for companies and their extended enterprise.[3]

***** History[edit] *****
The inspiration for the burgeoning business process now known as PLM came from
American_Motors_Corporation (AMC).[4][5] The automaker was looking for a way to
speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger
competitors in 1985, according to FranÃ§ois_Castaing, Vice President for
Product Engineering and Development.[6] Lacking the "massive budgets of General
Motors, Ford, and foreign competitors â¦ AMC placed R&D emphasis on bolstering
the product life cycle of its prime products (particularly Jeeps)."[7] After
introducing its compact Jeep_Cherokee_(XJ), the vehicle that launched the
modern sport_utility_vehicle (SUV) market, AMC began development of a new
model, that later came out as the Jeep_Grand_Cherokee. The first part in its
quest for faster product development was computer-aided_design (CAD) software
system that made engineers more productive.[6] The second part in this effort
was the new communication system that allowed conflicts to be resolved faster,
as well as reducing costly engineering_changes because all drawings and
documents were in a central database.[6] The product data management was so
effective that after AMC was purchased by Chrysler, the system was expanded
throughout the enterprise connecting everyone involved in designing and
building products.[6] While an early_adopter of PLM technology, Chrysler was
able to become the auto industry's lowest-cost producer, recording development
costs that were half of the industry average by the mid-1990s.[6]
During 1982-83, Rockwell International developed initial concepts of PDM and
PLM for the B-1B bomber program.[8] The system called Engineering Data System
(EDS) was augmented to interface with Computervision and CADAM systems to track
part configurations and lifecycle of components and assemblies. Computervison
later released implementing only the PDM aspects as the lifecycle model was
specific to Rockwell and aerospace needs.
***** Forms[edit] *****
PLM systems help organizations in coping with the increasing complexity and
engineering challenges of developing new products for the global competitive
markets.[9]
Product lifecycle management (PLM) should be distinguished from 'product_life-
cycle_management_(marketing)' (PLCM). PLM describes the engineering aspect of a
product, from managing descriptions and properties of a product through its
development and useful life; whereas, PLCM refers to the commercial management
of life of a product in the business market with respect to costs and sales
measures.
Product lifecycle management can be considered one of the four cornerstones of
a manufacturing corporation's information_technology structure.[10] All
companies need to manage communications and information with their customers
(CRM-customer_relationship_management), their suppliers and fulfillment (SCM-
supply_chain_management), their resources within the enterprise (ERP-enterprise
resource_planning) and their product planning and development (PLM).
One form of PLM is called people-centric PLM. While traditional PLM tools have
been deployed only on release or during the release phase, people-centric PLM
targets the design phase.
As of 2009, ICT development (EU-funded PROMISE project 2004â2008) has allowed
PLM to extend beyond traditional PLM and integrate sensor data and real time
'lifecycle event data' into PLM, as well as allowing this information to be
made available to different players in the total lifecycle of an individual
product (closing the information loop). This has resulted in the extension of
PLM into closed-loop_lifecycle_management (CL2M).
***** Benefits[edit] *****
Documented benefits of product lifecycle management include:[11][12]
    * Reduced time_to_market
    * Increase full price sales
    * Improved product quality and reliability
    * Reduced prototyping costs
    * More accurate and timely request for quote generation
    * Ability to quickly identify potential sales opportunities and revenue
      contributions
    * Savings through the re-use of original data
    * A framework for product optimization
    * Reduced waste
    * Savings through the complete integration of engineering workflows
    * Documentation that can assist in proving compliance for RoHS or Title_21
      CFR_Part_11
    * Ability to provide contract manufacturers with access to a centralized
      product record
    * Seasonal fluctuation management
    * Improved forecasting to reduce material costs
    * Maximize supply_chain_collaboration
***** Areas of PLM[edit] *****
Within PLM there are five primary areas;
   1. Systems_engineering (SE) is focused on meeting all requirements,
      primarily meeting customer needs, and coordinating the systems design
      process by involving all relevant disciplines. An important aspect for
      life cycle management is a subset within Systems Engineering called
      Reliability_Engineering.
   2. Product and portfolio_mÂ² (PPM) is focused on managing resource
      allocation, tracking progress, plan for new_product_development projects
      that are in process (or in a holding status). Portfolio management is a
      tool that assists management in tracking progress on new products and
      making trade-off decisions when allocating scarce resources.
   3. Product_design (CAx) is the process of creating a new product to be sold
      by a business to its customers.
   4. Manufacturing_process_management (MPM) is a collection of technologies
      and methods used to define how products are to be manufactured.
   5. Product_data_management (PDM) is focused on capturing and maintaining
      information on products and/or services through their development and
      useful life. Change management is an important part of PDM/PLM.
Note: While application software is not required for PLM processes, the
business complexity and rate of change requires organizations execute as
rapidly as possible.
***** Introduction to development process[edit] *****
The core of PLM (product lifecycle management) is the creation and central
management of all product data and the technology used to access this
information and knowledge. PLM as a discipline emerged from tools such as CAD,
CAM and PDM, but can be viewed as the integration of these tools with methods,
people and the processes through all stages of a productâs life.[13] It is
not just about software technology but is also a business strategy.[14]
Product lifecycle management
For simplicity the stages described are shown in a traditional sequential
engineering workflow. The exact order of event and tasks will vary according to
the product and industry in question but the main processes are:[15]
    * Conceive
          o Specification
          o Concept design
    * Design
          o Detailed design
          o Validation and analysis (simulation)
          o Tool design
    * Realise
          o Plan manufacturing
          o Manufacture
          o Build/Assemble
          o Test (quality_control)
    * Service
          o Sell and deliver
          o Use
          o Maintain and support
          o Dispose
The major key point events are:
    * Order
    * Idea
    * Kickoff
    * Design_freeze
    * Launch
The reality is however more complex, people and departments cannot perform
their tasks in isolation and one activity cannot simply finish and the next
activity start. Design is an iterative process, often designs need to be
modified due to manufacturing constraints or conflicting requirements. Whether
a customer order fits into the time line depends on the industry type and
whether the products are for example, built to order, engineered to order, or
assembled to order.

Many software solutions have been developed to organize and integrate the
different phases of a productâs lifecycle. PLM should not be seen as a single
software product but a collection of software tools and working methods
integrated together to address either single stages of the lifecycle or connect
different tasks or manage the whole process. Some software providers cover the
whole PLM range while others single niche application. Some applications can
span many fields of PLM with different modules within the same data model. An
overview of the fields within PLM is covered here. The simple classifications
do not always fit exactly; many areas overlap and many software products cover
more than one area or do not fit easily into one category. It should also not
be forgotten that one of the main goals of PLM is to collect knowledge that can
be reused for other projects and to coordinate simultaneous concurrent
development of many products. It is about business processes, people and
methods as much as software application solutions. Although PLM is mainly
associated with engineering tasks it also involves marketing activities such as
product_portfolio_management (PPM), particularly with regards to new_product
development (NPD). There are several life-cycle models in industry to consider,
but most are rather similar. What follows below is one possible life-cycle
model; while it emphasizes hardware-oriented products, similar phases would
describe any form of product or service, including non-technical or software-
based products:[16]
**** Phase 1: Conceive[edit] ****
*** Imagine, specify, plan, innovate[edit] ***
The first stage is the definition of the product requirements based on
customer, company, market and regulatory bodiesâ viewpoints. From this
specification, the product's major technical parameters can be defined. In
parallel, the initial concept design work is performed defining the aesthetics
of the product together with its main functional aspects. Many different media
are used for these processes, from pencil and paper to clay models to 3D CAID
computer-aided_industrial_design software.
In some concepts, the investment of resources into research or analysis-of-
options may be included in the conception phase â e.g. bringing the
technology to a level of maturity sufficient to move to the next phase.
However, life-cycle engineering is iterative. It is always possible that
something doesn't work well in any phase enough to back up into a prior phase
â perhaps all the way back to conception or research. There are many examples
to draw from.
**** Phase 2: Design[edit] ****
*** Describe, define, develop, test, analyze and validate[edit] ***
This is where the detailed design and development of the productâs form
starts, progressing to prototype testing, through pilot release to full product
launch. It can also involve redesign and ramp for improvement to existing
products as well as planned_obsolescence.[17] The main tool used for design and
development is CAD. This can be simple 2D drawing / drafting or 3D parametric
feature based solid/surface modeling. Such software includes technology such as
Hybrid Modeling, Reverse_Engineering, KBE (knowledge-based_engineering), NDT
(Nondestructive_testing), and Assembly construction.
This step covers many engineering disciplines including: mechanical,
electrical, electronic, software (embedded), and domain-specific, such as
architectural, aerospace, automotive, ... Along with the actual creation of
geometry there is the analysis of the components and product assemblies.
Simulation, validation and optimization tasks are carried out using CAE
(computer-aided_engineering) software either integrated in the CAD package or
stand-alone. These are used to perform tasks such as:- Stress analysis, FEA
(finite_element_analysis); kinematics; computational_fluid_dynamics (CFD); and
mechanical event simulation (MES). CAQ (computer-aided_quality) is used for
tasks such as Dimensional tolerance_(engineering) analysis. Another task
performed at this stage is the sourcing of bought out components, possibly with
the aid of procurement systems.
**** Phase 3: Realize[edit] ****
*** Manufacture, make, build, procure, produce, sell and deliver[edit] ***
Once the design of the productâs components is complete, the method of
manufacturing is defined. This includes CAD tasks such as tool design;
including creation of CNC Machining instructions for the productâs parts as
well as creation of specific tools to manufacture those parts, using integrated
or separate CAM (computer-aided_manufacturing) software. This will also involve
analysis tools for process simulation of operations such as casting, molding,
and die-press forming. Once the manufacturing method has been identified CPM
comes into play. This involves CAPE (Computer Aided Production Engineering) or
CAP/CAPP (Computer Aided production_planning) tools for carrying out factory,
plant and facility layout and production simulation e.g. press-line simulation,
industrial ergonomics, as well as tool selection management. Once components
are manufactured, their geometrical form and size can be checked against the
original CAD data with the use of computer-aided inspection equipment and
software. Parallel to the engineering tasks, sales product configuration and
marketing documentation work take place. This could include transferring
engineering data (geometry and part list data) to a web based sales
configurator and other desktop_publishing systems.
**** Phase 4: Service[edit] ****
*** Use, operate, maintain, support, sustain, phase-out, retire, recycle and
disposal[edit] ***
The final phase of the lifecycle involves managing "in-service" information.
This can include providing customers and service engineers with the support and
information required for repair_and_maintenance, as well as waste_management or
recycling. This can involve the use of tools such as Maintenance, Repair and
Operations Management (MRO) software.
There is an end-of-life to every product. Whether it be disposal or destruction
of material objects or information, this needs to be carefully considered since
it may be legislated and hence not free from ramifications.
*** Operational Upgrades[edit] ***
During the operational phase, a product owner may discover components and
consumables which have reached individual end of life and for which there are
Diminishing Manufacturing Sources or Material Shortages (DMSMS), or that the
existing product can be enhanced for a wider or emerging user market easier or
at less cost than a full redesign. This modernization approach often extends
the product life cycle and delays end of life disposal.
**** All phases: product lifecycle[edit] ****
*** Communicate, manage and collaborate[edit] ***
None of the above phases should be considered as isolated. In reality, a
project does not run sequentially or separated from other product development
projects, with information flowing between different people and systems. A
major part of PLM is the co-ordination and management of product definition
data. This includes managing engineering changes and release status of
components; configuration product variations; document management; planning
project resources as well as timescale and risk assessment.
For these tasks data of graphical, textual and meta nature â such as product
Bills_Of_Materials (BOMs) â needs to be managed. At the engineering
departments level this is the domain of Product_Data_Management (PDM) software,
or at the corporate level Enterprise Data Management (EDM) software; such rigid
level distinctions may not be consistently used, however it is typical to see
two or more data management systems within an organization. These systems may
also be linked to other corporate systems such as SCM, CRM, and ERP. Associated
with these system are project_management systems for project/program planning.
This central role is covered by numerous collaborative_product_development
tools which run throughout the whole lifecycle and across organizations. This
requires many technology tools in the areas of conferencing, data sharing and
data translation. This specialised field is referred to as product
visualization which includes technologies such as DMU (digital_mock-up),
immersive virtual digital prototyping (virtual_reality), and photo-realistic
imaging.
*** User skills[edit] ***
The broad array of solutions that make up the tools used within a PLM solution-
set (e.g., CAD, CAM, CAx...) were initially used by dedicated practitioners who
invested time and effort to gain the required skills. Designers and engineers
worked wonders with CAD systems, manufacturing engineers became highly skilled
CAM users while analysts, administrators and managers fully mastered their
support technologies. However, achieving the full advantages of PLM requires
the participation of many people of various skills from throughout an extended
enterprise, each requiring the ability to access and operate on the inputs and
output of other participants.
Despite the increased ease of use of PLM tools, cross-training all personnel on
the entire PLM tool-set has not proven to be practical. Now, however, advances
are being made to address ease of use for all participants within the PLM
arena. One such advance is the availability of "role" specific user interfaces.
Through tailorable user interfaces (UIs), the commands that are presented to
users are appropriate to their function and expertise.
These techniques include:-
    * Concurrent_engineering workflow
    * Industrial_design
    * Bottomâup design
    * Topâdown design
    * Both-ends-against-the-middle design
    * Front-loading design workflow
    * Design in context
    * Modular design
    * NPD new_product_development
    * DFSS design_for_Six_Sigma
    * DFMA design for manufacture / assembly
    * Digital simulation engineering
    * Requirement-driven design
    * Specification-managed validation
    * Configuration_management
**** Concurrent engineering workflow[edit] ****
Concurrent_engineering (British English: simultaneous engineering) is a
workflow that, instead of working sequentially through stages, carries out a
number of tasks in parallel. For example: starting tool design as soon as the
detailed design has started, and before the detailed designs of the product are
finished; or starting on detail design solid models before the concept design
surfaces models are complete. Although this does not necessarily reduce the
amount of manpower required for a project, as more changes are required due to
the incomplete and changing information, it does drastically reduce lead times
and thus time to market.
Feature-based CAD systems have for many years allowed the simultaneous work on
3D solid model and the 2D drawing by means of two separate files, with the
drawing looking at the data in the model; when the model changes the drawing
will associatively update. Some CAD packages also allow associative copying of
geometry between files. This allows, for example, the copying of a part design
into the files used by the tooling designer. The manufacturing engineer can
then start work on tools before the final design freeze; when a design changes
size or shape the tool geometry will then update. Concurrent engineering also
has the added benefit of providing better and more immediate communication
between departments, reducing the chance of costly, late design changes. It
adopts a problem prevention method as compared to the problem solving and re-
designing method of traditional sequential engineering.
**** Bottomâup design[edit] ****
Bottomâup design (CAD-centric) occurs where the definition of 3D models of a
product starts with the construction of individual components. These are then
virtually brought together in sub-assemblies of more than one level until the
full product is digitally defined. This is sometimes known as the "review
structure" which shows what the product will look like. The BOM contains all of
the physical (solid) components of a product from a CAD system; it may also
(but not always) contain other 'bulk items' required for the final product but
which (in spite of having definite physical mass and volume) are not usually
associated with CAD geometry such as paint, glue, oil, adhesive tape and other
materials.
Bottomâup design tends to focus on the capabilities of available real-world
physical technology, implementing those solutions which this technology is most
suited to. When these bottomâup solutions have real-world value, bottomâup
design can be much more efficient than topâdown design. The risk of
bottomâup design is that it very efficiently provides solutions to low-value
problems. The focus of bottomâup design is "what can we most efficiently do
with this technology?" rather than the focus of topâdown which is "What is
the most valuable thing to do?"
**** Topâdown design[edit] ****
Topâdown design is focused on high-level functional requirements, with
relatively less focus on existing implementation technology. A top level spec
is repeatedly decomposed into lower level structures and specifications, until
the physical implementation layer is reached. The risk of a topâdown design
is that it may not take advantage of more efficient applications of current
physical technology, due to excessive layers of lower-level abstraction due to
following an abstraction path which does not efficiently fit available
components e.g. separately specifying sensing, processing, and wireless
communications elements even though a suitable component that combines these
may be available. The positive value of topâdown design is that it preserves
a focus on the optimum solution requirements.
A part-centric topâdown design may eliminate some of the risks of topâdown
design. This starts with a layout model, often a simple 2D sketch defining
basic sizes and some major defining parameters, which may include some
Industrial_design elements. Geometry from this is associatively copied down to
the next level, which represents different subsystems of the product. The
geometry in the sub-systems is then used to define more detail in levels below.
Depending on the complexity of the product, a number of levels of this assembly
are created until the basic definition of components can be identified, such as
position and principal dimensions. This information is then associatively
copied to component files. In these files the components are detailed; this is
where the classic bottomâup assembly starts.
The topâdown assembly is sometime known as a "control structure". If a single
file is used to define the layout and parameters for the review structure it is
often known as a skeleton file.
Defense engineering traditionally develops the product structure from the top
down. The system engineering process[18] prescribes a functional decomposition
of requirements and then physical allocation of product structure to the
functions. This top down approach would normally have lower levels of the
product structure developed from CAD data as a bottomâup structure or design.
**** Both-ends-against-the-middle design[edit] ****
Both-ends-against-the-middle (BEATM) design is a design process that endeavors
to combine the best features of topâdown design, and bottomâup design into
one process. A BEATM design process flow may begin with an emergent technology
which suggests solutions which may have value, or it may begin with a
topâdown view of an important problem which needs a solution. In either case
the key attribute of BEATM design methodology is to immediately focus at both
ends of the design process flow: a topâdown view of the solution
requirements, and a bottomâup view of the available technology which may
offer promise of an efficient solution. The BEATM design process proceeds from
both ends in search of an optimum merging somewhere between the topâdown
requirements, and bottomâup efficient implementation. In this fashion, BEATM
has been shown to genuinely offer the best of both methodologies. Indeed, some
of the best success stories from either topâdown or bottomâup have been
successful because of an intuitive, yet unconscious use of the BEATM
methodology. When employed consciously, BEATM offers even more powerful
advantages.
**** Front loading design and workflow[edit] ****
Front loading is taking topâdown design to the next stage. The complete
control structure and review structure, as well as downstream data such as
drawings, tooling development and CAM models, are constructed before the
product has been defined or a project kick-off has been authorized. These
assemblies of files constitute a template from which a family of products can
be constructed. When the decision has been made to go with a new product, the
parameters of the product are entered into the template model and all the
associated data is updated. Obviously predefined associative models will not be
able to predict all possibilities and will require additional work. The main
principle is that a lot of the experimental/investigative work has already been
completed. A lot of knowledge is built into these templates to be reused on new
products. This does require additional resources "up front" but can drastically
reduce the time between project kick-off and launch. Such methods do however
require organizational changes, as considerable engineering efforts are moved
into "offline" development departments. It can be seen as an analogy to
creating a concept_car to test new technology for future products, but in this
case the work is directly used for the next product generation.
**** Design in context[edit] ****
Individual components cannot be constructed in isolation. CAD and CAID models
of components are created within the context of some or all of the other
components within the product being developed. This is achieved using assembly
modelling techniques. Geometry of other components can be seen and referenced
within the CAD tool being used. The other referenced components may or may not
have been created using the same CAD tool, with their geometry being translated
from other collaborative product development (CPD) formats. Some assembly
checking such as DMU is also carried out using product_visualization software.
***** Product and process lifecycle management (PPLM)[edit] *****
Product and process lifecycle management (PPLM) is an alternate genre of PLM in
which the process by which the product is made is just as important as the
product itself. Typically, this is the life sciences and advanced specialty
chemicals markets. The process behind the manufacture of a given compound is a
key element of the regulatory filing for a new drug application. As such, PPLM
seeks to manage information around the development of the process in a similar
fashion that baseline PLM talks about managing information around development
of the product.
One variant of PPLM implementations are Process_Development_Execution_Systems
(PDES). They typically implement the whole development cycle of high-tech
manufacturing technology developments, from initial conception, through
development and into manufacture. PDES integrate people with different
backgrounds from potentially different legal entities, data, information and
knowledge and business processes.
***** Market size[edit] *****
Total spending on PLM software and services was estimated in 2006 to be above
$30 billion a year.[19][20]
After the Great_Recession, PLM investments from 2010 onwards showed a higher
growth rate than most general IT spending.[21]
***** Pyramid of Production Systems[edit] *****
Pyramid of Production Systems
According to Malakooti (2013),[22] there are five long-term objectives that
should be considered in production systems:
    * Cost: Which can be measured in terms of monetary units and usually
      consists of fixed and variable cost.
    * Productivity: Which can be measured in terms of the number of products
      produced during a period of time.
    * Quality: Which can be measured in terms of customer satisfaction levels
      for example.
    * Flexibility: Which can be considered the ability of the system to produce
      a variety of products for example.
    * Sustainability: Which can be measured in terms ecological soundness i.e.
      biological and environmental impacts of a production system.
The relation between these five objects can be presented as pyramid with its
tip associated with the lowest Cost, highest Productivity, highest Quality,
most Flexibility, and greatest Sustainability. The points inside of this
pyramid are associated with different combinations of five criteria. The tip of
the pyramid represents an ideal (but likely highly unfeasible) system whereas
the base of the pyramid represents the worst system possible.
