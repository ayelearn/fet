In late 2012, it was announced by Pedro_DamiÃ¡n, told the Televisa channel,
that the group would return to the stage in 2013. According to Damian, the
project was to do something amazing and interesting: "Let's talk to them. Let's
convince them to do something amazing, something interesting." He stated he was
determined to revive the picture band and he would be chatting with members;
trying to convince them to do a reunion. Following Damian's statements, Dulce
MarÃ­a said in an interview with Televisa that it was too early for a comeback;
however, she did not rule out the possibility of ever doing a reunion with her
former teammates. "I do not know about the future," she stated in the
interview. "[B]ut right now there's no way. Each of us is focused on his or her
career. It's still very early. But don't say never." Around the same time, in
an interview for MTV Brasil, Christian_ChÃ¡vez said it was possible for a
return in 2014, and this was confirmed by DamÃ­an. On July 27, 2013, However,
there was no official statement from Dulce, Herrera, Uckermann, Anahi or
Perroni of this occurring or a set date.

documentary about the group in celebration of the sextet's ten-year
anniversary. In an interview with Televisa channel, the producer said he'll
have something more concrete on the project later in the year. "I have
something like 800 hours of recordings... We are already working."
