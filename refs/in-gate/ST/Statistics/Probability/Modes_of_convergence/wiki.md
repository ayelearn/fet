****** Modes of convergence ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In mathematics, there are many senses in which a sequence or a series is said
to be convergent. This article describes various modes (senses or species) of
convergence in the settings where they are defined. For a list of modes of
convergence, see Modes_of_convergence_(annotated_index)
Note that each of the following objects is a special case of the types
preceding it: sets, topological_spaces, uniform_spaces, TAGs (topological
abelian groups), normed_spaces, Euclidean_spaces, and the real/complex numbers.
Also, note that any metric_space is a uniform space.

***** Elements of a topological space[edit] *****
Convergence can be defined in terms of sequences in first-countable_spaces.
Nets are a generalization of sequences that are useful in spaces which are not
first countable. Filters further generalize the concept of convergence.
In metric spaces, one can define Cauchy_sequences. Cauchy nets and filters are
generalizations to uniform_spaces. Even more generally, Cauchy_spaces are
spaces in which Cauchy filters may be defined. Convergence implies "Cauchy-
convergence", and Cauchy-convergence, together with the existence of a
convergent subsequence implies convergence. The concept of completeness of
metric spaces, and its generalizations is defined in terms of Cauchy sequences.
***** Series of elements in a topological abelian group[edit] *****
In a topological_abelian_group, convergence of a series is defined as
convergence of the sequence of partial sums. An important concept when
considering series is unconditional_convergence, which guarantees that the
limit of the series is invariant under permutations of the summands.
In a normed vector space, one can define absolute_convergence as convergence of
the series of norms (    &#x03A3;  |   b  k    |    {\displaystyle \Sigma |b_
{k}|}  [\Sigma |b_{k}|]). Absolute convergence implies Cauchy convergence of
the sequence of partial sums (by the triangle inequality), which in turn
implies absolute-convergence of some grouping (not reordering). The sequence of
partial sums obtained by grouping is a subsequence of the partial sums of the
original series. The norm convergence of absolutely convergent series is an
equivalent condition for a normed linear space to be Banach (i.e.: complete).
Absolute convergence and convergence together imply unconditional convergence,
but unconditional convergence does not imply absolute convergence in general,
even if the space is Banach, although the implication holds in       R   d
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}  [\mathbb {R} ^{d}].
***** Convergence of sequence of functions on a topological space[edit] *****
The most basic type of convergence for a sequence of functions (in particular,
it does not assume any topological structure on the domain of the functions) is
pointwise_convergence. It is defined as convergence of the sequence of values
of the functions at every point. If the functions take their values in a
uniform space, then one can define pointwise Cauchy convergence, uniform
convergence, and uniform_Cauchy_convergence of the sequence.
Pointwise convergence implies pointwise Cauchy-convergence, and the converse
holds if the space in which the functions take their values is complete.
Uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence and uniform Cauchy
convergence. Uniform Cauchy convergence and pointwise convergence of a
subsequence imply uniform convergence of the sequence, and if the codomain is
complete, then uniform Cauchy convergence implies uniform convergence.
If the domain of the functions is a topological space, local_uniform
convergence (i.e. uniform convergence on a neighborhood of each point) and
compact_(uniform)_convergence (i.e. uniform convergence on all compact_subsets)
may be defined. Note that "compact convergence" is always short for "compact
uniform convergence," since "compact pointwise convergence" would mean the same
thing as "pointwise convergence" (points are always compact).
Uniform convergence implies both local uniform convergence and compact
convergence, since both are local notions while uniform convergence is global.
If X is locally_compact (even in the weakest sense: every point has compact
neighborhood), then local uniform convergence is equivalent to compact
(uniform) convergence. Roughly speaking, this is because "local" and "compact"
connote the same thing.
***** Series of functions on a topological abelian group[edit] *****
Pointwise and uniform convergence of series of functions are defined in terms
of convergence of the sequence of partial sums.
For functions taking values in a normed_linear_space, absolute convergence
refers to convergence of the series of positive, real-valued functions
&#x03A3;  |   g  k    |    {\displaystyle \Sigma |g_{k}|}  [\Sigma |g_{k}|] .
"Pointwise absolute convergence" is then simply pointwise convergence of
&#x03A3;  |   g  k    |    {\displaystyle \Sigma |g_{k}|}  [\Sigma |g_{k}|].
Normal_convergence[1] is convergence of the series of non-negative real numbers
obtained by taking the uniform_(i.e._"sup")_norm of each function in the series
(uniform convergence of     &#x03A3;  |   g  k    |    {\displaystyle \Sigma
|g_{k}|}  [\Sigma |g_{k}|]). In Banach_spaces, pointwise absolute convergence
implies pointwise convergence, and normal convergence implies uniform
convergence.
For functions defined on a topological space, one can define (as above) local
uniform_convergence and compact_(uniform)_convergence in terms of the partial
sums of the series. If, in addition, the functions take values in a normed
linear space, then local_normal_convergence (local, uniform, absolute
convergence) and compact_normal_convergence (absolute convergence on compact
sets) can be defined.
Normal convergence implies both local normal convergence and compact normal
convergence. And if the domain is locally_compact (even in the weakest sense),
then local normal convergence implies compact normal convergence.
***** Functions defined on a measure space[edit] *****
Main article: Convergence_of_random_variables
If one considers sequences of measurable_functions, then several modes of
convergence that depend on measure-theoretic, rather than solely topological
properties, arise. This includes pointwise convergence almost-everywhere,
convergence in p-mean and convergence in measure. These are of particular
interest in probability_theory.
