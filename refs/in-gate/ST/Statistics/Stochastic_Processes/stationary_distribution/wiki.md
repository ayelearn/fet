From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Stationary distribution may refer to:
    * A special distribution for a Markov_chain such that if the chain starts
      with its stationary distribution, the marginal distribution of all states
      at any time will always be the stationary distribution. Assuming
      irreducibility, the stationary distribution is always unique if it
      exists, and its existence can be implied by positive recurrence of all
      states. The stationary distribution has the interpretation of the
      limiting_distribution when the chain is ergodic.
    * The marginal_distribution of a stationary_process or stationary time
      series
    * The set of joint_probability_distributions of a stationary_process or
      stationary time_series
In some fields of application, the term stable distribution is used for the
equivalent of a stationary (marginal) distribution, although in probability and
statistics the term has a rather different meaning: see stable_distribution.
Crudely stated, all of the above are specific cases of a common general
concept. A stationary distribution is a specific entity which is unchanged by
the effect of some matrix or operator: it need not be unique. Thus stationary
distributions are related to eigenvectors for which the eigenvalue is unity.
