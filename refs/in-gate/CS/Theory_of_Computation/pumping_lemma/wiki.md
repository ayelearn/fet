Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In the theory of formal_languages, the pumping lemma may refer to:
    * Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages, the fact that all sufficiently long
      strings in such a language have a substring that can be repeated
      arbitrarily many times, usually used to prove that certain languages are
      not regular
    * Pumping_lemma_for_context-free_languages, the fact that all sufficiently
      long strings in such a language have a pair of substrings that can be
      repeated arbitrarily many times, usually used to prove that certain
      languages are not context-free
    * Pumping lemma for indexed_languages
    * Pumping_lemma_for_regular_tree_languages
***** See also[edit] *****
    * Ogden's_lemma, a stronger version of the pumping lemma for context-free
      languages
