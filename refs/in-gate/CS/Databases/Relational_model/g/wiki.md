***** History *****
For earlier history, see C_Ã‚Â§Â History.
The letter 'G' was introduced in the Old_Latin_period as a variant of 'C' to
distinguish voiced /Ã‰Â¡/ from voiceless /k/. The recorded originator of 'G' is
freedman Spurius_Carvilius_Ruga, the first Roman to open a fee-paying school,
who taught around 230 BCE. At this time, 'K' had fallen out of favor, and 'C',
which had formerly represented both /Ã‰Â¡/ and /k/ before open vowels, had come
to express /k/ in all environments.
Ruga's positioning of 'G' shows that alphabetic_order related to the letters'
values as Greek_numerals was a concern even in the 3rd century BC. According to
some records, the original seventh letter, 'Z', had been purged from the Latin
alphabet somewhat earlier in the 3rd century BC by the Roman_censor Appius
Claudius, who found it distasteful and foreign.[2] Sampson (1985) suggests
that: "Evidently the order of the alphabet was felt to be such a concrete thing
that a new letter could be added in the middle only if a 'space' was created by
the dropping of an old letter."[3] The 3rd-century-BC addition of the letter G
to the Roman alphabet is credited to Spurius_Carvilius_Ruga.[4]
George Hempl proposed in 1899 that there never was such a "space" in the
alphabet and that in fact 'G' was a direct descendant of zeta. Zeta took shapes
like Ã¢ÂŠÂ in some of the Old_Italic_scripts; the development of the monumental
form 'G' from this shape would be exactly parallel to the development of 'C'
from gamma. He suggests that the pronunciation /k/ > /Ã‰Â¡/ was due to
contamination from the also similar-looking 'K'.[5]
Eventually, both velar_consonants /k/ and /Ã‰Â¡/ developed palatalized allophones
before front vowels; consequently in today's Romance_languages,
&#x27e8;c&#x27e9; and &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; have different sound values depending
on context (known as hard_and_soft_C and hard_and_soft_G). Because of French
influence, English_orthography shares this feature.
**** Typographic variants ****
Typographic_variants include a double-storey and single-storey g.
The modern lowercase 'g' has two typographic variants: the single-storey
(sometimes opentail) 'g' and the double-storey (sometimes looptail) 'g'. The
single-storey form derives from the majuscule (uppercase) form by raising the
serif that distinguishes it from 'c' to the top of the loop, thus closing the
loop, and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left. The double-
storey form (g) had developed similarly, except that some ornate forms then
extended the tail back to the right, and to the left again, forming a closed
bowl or loop. The initial extension to the left was absorbed into the upper
closed bowl. The double-storey version became popular when printing switched to
"Roman_type" because the tail was effectively shorter, making it possible to
put more lines on a page. In the double-storey version, a small top stroke in
the upper-right, often terminating in an orb shape, is called an "ear".
Generally, the two forms are complementary, but occasionally the difference has
been exploited to provide contrast. In the International_Phonetic_Alphabet,
opentail &#x27e8;Ã‰Â¡&#x27e9; has always represented a voiced_velar_plosive,
while &#x27e8;[Looptail_g.svg]&#x27e9; was distinguished from
&#x27e8;Ã‰Â¡&#x27e9; and represented a voiced_velar_fricative from 1895 to 1900.
[6][7] In 1948, the Council of the International_Phonetic_Association
recognized &#x27e8;Ã‰Â¡&#x27e9; and &#x27e8;[Looptail_g.svg]&#x27e9; as
typographic equivalents,[8] and this decision was reaffirmed in 1993.[9] While
the 1949 Principles of the International Phonetic Association recommended the
use of &#x27e8;[Looptail_g.svg]&#x27e9; for a velar plosive and
&#x27e8;Ã‰Â¡&#x27e9; for an advanced one for languages where it is preferable to
distinguish the two, such as Russian,[10] this practice never caught on.[11]
The 1999 Handbook of the International Phonetic Association, the successor to
the Principles, abandoned the recommendation and acknowledged both shapes as
acceptable variants.[12]
Wong et al. (2018) found that native English speakers have little conscious
awareness of the looptail 'g' ([Looptail_g.svg]).[13][14] They write: "Despite
being questioned repeatedly, and despite being informed directly that G has two
lowercase print forms, nearly half of the participants failed to reveal any
knowledge of the looptail 'g', and only 1 of the 38 participants was able to
write looptail 'g' correctly."

**** English ****
In English, the letter appears either alone or in some digraphs. Alone, it
represents
    * a voiced_velar_plosive (/Ã‰Â¡/ or "hard" &#x27e8;g&#x27e9;), as in goose,
      gargoyle and game;
    * a voiced_palato-alveolar_affricate (/dÃÂ¡ÃŠÂ’/ or "soft" &#x27e8;g&#x27e9;),
      generally before &#x27e8;i&#x27e9; or &#x27e8;e&#x27e9;, as in giant,
      ginger and geology; or
    * a voiced_palato-alveolar_sibilant (/ÃŠÂ’/) in some words of French origin,
      such as rouge, beige and genre.
In words of Romance origin, &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; is mainly soft before
&#x27e8;e&#x27e9; (including the digraphs &#x27e8;ae&#x27e9; and
&#x27e8;oe&#x27e9;), &#x27e8;i&#x27e9;, or &#x27e8;y&#x27e9;, and hard
otherwise. Soft &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; is also used in many words that came into
English through medieval or modern Romance languages from languages without
soft &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; (like Ancient Latin and Greek) (e.g. fragile or logic).
There are many English words of non-Romance origin where &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; is
hard though followed by &#x27e8;e&#x27e9; or &#x27e8;i&#x27e9; (e.g. get,
gift), and a few in which &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; is soft though followed by
&#x27e8;a&#x27e9; such as gaol or margarine.
The double consonant &#x27e8;gg&#x27e9; has the value /Ã‰Â¡/ (hard
&#x27e8;g&#x27e9;) as in nugget, with very few exceptions: /Ã‰Â¡dÃÂ¡ÃŠÂ’/ in suggest
and /dÃÂ¡ÃŠÂ’/ in exaggerate and veggies.
The digraph &#x27e8;dg&#x27e9; has the value /dÃÂ¡ÃŠÂ’/ (soft &#x27e8;g&#x27e9;),
as in badger. Non-digraph &#x27e8;dg&#x27e9; can also occur, in compounds like
floodgate and headgear.
The digraph &#x27e8;ng&#x27e9; may represent
    * a velar_nasal (/Ã…Â‹/) as in length, singer
    * the latter followed by hard &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; (/Ã…Â‹Ã‰Â¡/) as in jungle,
      finger, longest
Non-digraph &#x27e8;ng&#x27e9; also occurs, with possible values
    * /nÃ‰Â¡/ as in engulf, ungainly
    * /ndÃÂ¡ÃŠÂ’/ as in sponge, angel
    * /nÃŠÂ’/ as in melange
The digraph &#x27e8;gh&#x27e9; (in many cases a replacement for the obsolete
letter yogh, which took various values including /Ã‰Â¡/, /Ã‰Â£/, /x/ and /j/) may
represent
    * /Ã‰Â¡/ as in ghost, aghast, burgher, spaghetti
    * /f/ as in cough, laugh, roughage
    * ÃƒÂ˜ (no sound) as in through, neighbor, night
    * /p/ in hiccough
    * /x/ in ugh
Non-digraph &#x27e8;gh&#x27e9; also occurs, in compounds like foghorn,
pigheaded
The digraph &#x27e8;gn&#x27e9; may represent
    * /n/ as in gnostic, deign, foreigner, signage
    * /nj/ in loanwords like champignon, lasagna
Non-digraph &#x27e8;gn&#x27e9; also occurs, as in signature, agnostic
The trigraph &#x27e8;ngh&#x27e9; has the value /Ã…Â‹/ as in gingham or dinghy.
Non-trigraph &#x27e8;ngh&#x27e9; also occurs, in compounds like stronghold and
dunghill.
**** Other languages ****
Most Romance_languages and some Nordic_languages also have two main
pronunciations for &#x27e8;g&#x27e9;, hard and soft. While the soft value of
&#x27e8;g&#x27e9; varies in different Romance languages (/ÃŠÂ’/ in French and
Portuguese, [(d)ÃŠÂ’] in Catalan, /dÃÂ¡ÃŠÂ’/ in Italian and Romanian, and /x/ in
most dialects of Spanish), in all except Romanian and Italian, soft
&#x27e8;g&#x27e9; has the same pronunciation as the &#x27e8;j&#x27e9;.
In Italian and Romanian, &#x27e8;gh&#x27e9; is used to represent /Ã‰Â¡/ before
front vowels where &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; would otherwise represent a soft value. In
Italian and French, &#x27e8;gn&#x27e9; is used to represent the palatal_nasal /
Ã‰Â²/, a sound somewhat similar to the &#x27e8;ny&#x27e9; in English canyon. In
Italian, the trigraph &#x27e8;gli&#x27e9;, when appearing before a vowel or as
the article and pronoun gli, represents the palatal_lateral_approximant /ÃŠÂ/.
Other languages typically use &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; to represent /Ã‰Â¡/ regardless of
position.
Amongst European languages, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, and Slovak are an exception
as they do not have /Ã‰Â¡/ in their native words. In Dutch, &#x27e8;g&#x27e9;
represents a voiced_velar_fricative /Ã‰Â£/ instead, a sound that does not occur
in modern English, but there is a dialectal variation: many Netherlandic
dialects use a voiceless fricative ([x] or [ÃÂ‡]) instead, and in southern
dialects it may be palatal [ÃŠÂ]. Nevertheless, word-finally it is always
voiceless in all dialects, including the standard Dutch of Belgium and the
Netherlands. On the other hand, some dialects (like Amelands) may have a
phonemic /Ã‰Â¡/.
Faroese uses &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; to represent /dÃŠÂ’/, in addition to /Ã‰Â¡/, and
also uses it to indicate a glide.
In Maori (Te_Reo_MÃ„Âori), &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; is used in the digraph
&#x27e8;ng&#x27e9; which represents the velar_nasal /Ã…Â‹/ and is pronounced like
the &#x27e8;ng&#x27e9; in singer.
In older Czech and Slovak orthographies, &#x27e8;g&#x27e9; was used to
represent /j/, while /Ã‰Â¡/ was written as &#x27e8;Ã‡Â§&#x27e9; (&#x27e8;g&#x27e9;
with caron).
