Threads is a 1984 British apocalyptic war drama television film jointly
produced by the BBC, Nine_Network and Western-World Television Inc. Written by
Barry_Hines, and directed and produced by Mick_Jackson, it is a dramatic
account of nuclear_war and its effects on the city of Sheffield in Northern
England. The plot centres on two families as a confrontation between the United
States and the Soviet_Union erupts. As the nuclear exchange between NATO and
the Warsaw_Pact begins, the film depicts the medical, economic, social and
environmental consequences of nuclear war.
Shot on a budget of Â£400,000, the film was the first of its kind to depict a
nuclear_winter. Certain reviewers nominated Threads as the "film which comes
closest to representing the full horror of nuclear war and its aftermath, as
well as the catastrophic impact that the event would have on human culture."[2]
It has been compared to the earlier programme The_War_Game produced in Britain
in the 1960s and its contemporary counterpart The_Day_After, a 1983 ABC
television_film depicting a similar scenario in the United States. It was
nominated for seven BAFTA awards in 1985 and won for Best Single Drama, Best
Design, Best Film Cameraman and Best Film Editor.

***** Plot[edit] *****
The Sheffield_Royal_Infirmary, site of the hospital scene.
Young Sheffield residents Ruth Beckett and Jimmy Kemp plan to marry due to her
unplanned pregnancy. As tensions between the US and the Soviet Union in Iran
escalate, the Home_Office directs Sheffield_City_Council to assemble an
emergency operations team, which establishes itself in a makeshift bomb_shelter
in the basement of the town_hall. After an ignored US ultimatum to the Soviets
results in a brief tactical nuclear skirmish, Britain experiences fear, looting
and rioting. "Subversives" including peace_activists and some trade unionists
are arrested and interned under the Emergency_Powers_Act.
Curbar Edge, Peak_District, where the scenes set six weeks after the attack
take place.
Attack_Warning_Red is transmitted and Sheffield town hall staff react with
"action, confusion and slight panic."[3] Amidst panic, a nuclear warhead air
bursts high over the North_Sea, producing an electromagnetic_pulse; most
electrical systems throughout the UK and northwestern_Europe are destroyed. The
first missile salvos hit NATO targets, including nearby RAF_Finningley.
Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, chaos reigns in the streets.
Jimmy is last seen running from his stalled car to reach Ruth. Sheffield is
targeted by a one-megaton warhead which air bursts directly above the Tinsley
Viaduct. Strategic targets, including steel and chemical factories in the
Midlands, are the primary targets. Two thirds of all UK homes are destroyed,
and immediate deaths range between 12 and 30 million. Of 3,000 megatons total,
about 210 fall on the UK.
Sheffield Town Hall is destroyed and traps the city's emergency operations
team. They attempt to coordinate the city's emergency and relief efforts
through their few remaining short wave radios. Nuclear_fallout from a ground
burst at Crewe descends upon Sheffield. Jimmy's mother succumbs to radiation
sickness and severe burns after being caught by the Tinsley Viaduct explosion.
Jimmy's father dies searching for food and water. Fallout prevents the
remaining functioning civil authorities from fighting fires or rescuing those
trapped under debris. Ruth leaves her parents and grandmother in their
basement, making her way to the Sheffield_Royal_Infirmary, where there is no
electricity, running water, sanitation, or supplies. While she is absent,
looters kill her parents and are executed.
By June, soldiers dig to the town hall basement but find the emergency staff
have suffocated. Without the manpower or fuel to bury or burn the dead, an
epidemic of communicable diseases spreads. The government authorizes capital
punishment, and special courts execute criminals. The only viable currency
becomes food, given as a reward for work or withheld as punishment. The
millions of tons of soot, smoke and dust in the upper atmosphere trigger a
nuclear_winter. By July, without running water, electricity, or basic
sanitation, Sheffield becomes uninhabitable. Ruth and thousands of other
survivors defy official orders and leave the city. Many survivors die of
radiation poisoning. Low-flying government light aircraft order them to return
home. In Buxton, the police assign Ruth to a house. Once the policeman leaves,
the home owner evicts her at gunpoint. At an outdoor soup kitchen, Ruth meets
Bob, a pre-war acquaintance of Jimmy's. Ruth and Bob travel together, surviving
on scavenged food, including the raw carcasses of radiation poisoned livestock.
In September, Ruth partakes in the yearly harvest, accomplished using the last
remaining petrol and raw human labour, but the nuclear winter keeps yields low.
Ruth gives birth to her child in an abandoned barn. The army relies on rifles
and tear gas for control.
Millions of people around the Northern Hemisphere have died due to radiation,
fallout or the nuclear strikes. Sunlight returns, but food remains scarce due
to the lack of equipment, fertilizers, and fuel. Damage to the ozone_layer
intensifies ultraviolet_radiation, increasing cataracts and cancer.
Ten years later, Britain's population has fallen to medieval levels of about 4
to 11 million people. Survivors work the fields using primitive hand-held
farming tools. Few children have been born or raised since the attack. They
speak broken English due to poor education and the breakdown of family life.
Prematurely aged and blind with cataracts, Ruth collapses in a field and dies,
survived by her 10-year-old daughter Jane. The country begins to recover,
resuming coal_mining, producing limited electricity, and using steam power. The
population continues to live in near-barbaric squalor.
Three years after Ruth's death, Jane and two boys are caught stealing food. One
boy is shot in the ensuing confusion. Jane wrestles for the food with the other
boy and they have sex.[4] Pregnant, Jane finds a makeshift hospital, gives
birth to a stillborn child, and screams as she sees it.
***** Cast[edit] *****
Although Jackson initially considered casting actors from Coronation_Street, he
later decided to take a neorealist approach, and opted to cast relatively
unknown actors in order to heighten the film's impact through the use of
characters the audience could relate to.[5]

***** Production and themes[edit] *****
Our intention in making Threads was to step aside from the politics and â I
hope convincingly â show the actual effects on either side should our best
endeavours to prevent nuclear war fail.
Screenwriter Barry Hines[6]
Threads was first commissioned (under the working title Beyond Armageddon) by
the Director-General_of_the_BBC Alasdair_Milne, after he watched the 1965
drama-documentary The_War_Game, which had not been shown on the BBC when it was
made, due to pressure from the Wilson_government, although it had had a limited
release in cinemas.[7] Mick Jackson was hired to direct the film, as he had
previously worked in the area of nuclear apocalypse in 1982, producing the BBC
Q.E.D. documentary A Guide to Armageddon.[8][9] This was considered a
breakthrough at the time, considering the previous banning of The War Game,
which BBC staff believed would have resulted in mass suicides if aired. Jackson
subsequently travelled around the UK and the US, consulting leading scientists,
psychologists, doctors, defence specialists and strategic experts in order to
create the most realistic depiction of nuclear war possible for his next film.
[5] Jackson consulted various sources in his research, including the 1983
Science article Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear
Explosions, penned by Carl_Sagan and James_B._Pollack. Details of a possible
attack scenario and the extent of the damage were derived from Doomsday,
Britain after Nuclear Attack (1983), while the ineffective post-war plans of
the UK government came from Duncan_Campbell's 1982 exposÃ© War Plan UK.[10] In
portraying the psychological damage suffered by survivors, Jackson took
inspiration from the behaviour of the Hibakusha[7] and Magnus Clarke's 1982
book Nuclear Destruction of Britain.[10] Sheffield was chosen as the main
location partly because of its "nuclear-free_zone" policy that made the council
sympathetic to the local filming[6] and partly because it seemed likely that
the USSR would strike an industrial city in the centre of the country.[11]
Jackson hired Barry Hines to write the script because of his political
awareness. The relationship between the two was strained on several occasions,
as Hines spent much of his time on set, and apparently disliked Jackson on
account of his middle class upbringing.[5] As part of their research, the two
spent a week at the Home Office training centre for "official survivors" in
Easingwold which, according to Hines, showed just "how disorganised [post-war
reconstruction] would be."[12]
Auditions were advertised in The_Star,[13] and took place in the ballroom of
Sheffield_City_Hall, where 1,100 candidates turned up.[12] All extras were
chosen on the basis of height and age, and were all told to look "miserable"
and to wear ragged clothes. The makeup for extras playing third_degree_burn
victims consisted of Rice_Krispies and tomato_ketchup.[13] The scenes taking
place six weeks after the attack were shot at Curbar Edge in the Peak_District
National Park, though because weather conditions were considered too fine to
pass off as a nuclear winter, stage snow had to be spread around the rocks and
heather, and cameramen installed light filters on their equipment to block out
the sunlight.[12]
Jackson later recalled that while BBC productions would usually be followed by
phone calls of congratulations from friends or colleagues immediately after
airing, no such calls came after the first screening of Threads. Jackson later
"realised...that people had just sat there thinking about it, in many cases not
sleeping or being able to talk." He later said that he had it on good authority
that Ronald_Reagan watched the film when it aired in the US.[5] Hines himself
received a letter of praise from Labour_leader Neil_Kinnock.[14]
***** Broadcast and release history[edit] *****
Threads works on the viewer with a peculiar power: one finds oneself horrified,
fascinated, numbed, provoked, unsettled, made restless. Its power may be the
effect of its oscillation between form and content being so heavily weighted
toward the pole of contentâin this case, that threat of nuclear destruction
which cannot help but feel 'real'--so that we are unable to relax into Threads
as 'just' a movie.
Professor Andrew Bartlett of UCLA[15]
Threads was a co-production of the BBC, Nine_Network_Australia and Western-
World Television, Inc. It was first broadcast on BBC_Two on 23 September 1984
at 9:30 pm, and achieved the highest ratings on the channel (6.9 million) of
the week.[6] It was repeated on BBC_One on 1 August 1985 as part of a week of
programmes marking the fortieth anniversary of the atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima
and_Nagasaki, which also saw the first television screening of The_War_Game
(which had been deemed too disturbing for television in the 20 years since it
had been made). Threads was not shown again on British screens until the
digital channel BBC_Four broadcast it in October 2003.[16] It was also shown on
UKTV Documentary in September 2004 and was repeated in April 2005.[17]
Threads was broadcast in the United States on cable network Superstation_TBS on
13 January 1985,[18] with Ted_Turner presenting the introduction.[19] This was
followed by a panel discussion on nuclear war. It was also shown in syndication
to local commercial stations and, later, on many PBS stations. In Canada,
Threads was broadcast on CKVU in Vancouver[20] and CKND in Winnipeg,[21] while
in Australia it was shown on the Nine_Network on 19 June 1985.[22] Unusually
for a commercial network, it broadcast the film without commercial breaks.[23]
Threads was originally released by BBC_Video (on VHS and, for a very short
period, Betamax) in 1987 in the United Kingdom. The play was re-released on
both VHS and DVD in 2000 on the Revelation label, followed by a new DVD edition
in 2005. Due to licensing difficulties the 1987 release replaced Chuck_Berry's
recording of his song "Johnny_B._Goode" with an alternative recording of the
song. In all these cases, the original music over the opening narration was
removed, again due to licensing problems; this was an extract from the Alpine
Symphony by Richard_Strauss, performed by the Dresden_State_Opera_Orchestra,
conducted by Rudolf_Kempe (HMV ASD 3173).
In January 2018, journalist and nuclear threat expert Julie_McDowall led a
distributed viewing of the film, encouraging the audience to share their
reactions on Twitter under the hashtag #threaddread, as part of a campaign to
ask the BBC to show the movie for the first time since 2003.[24]
On 13 February 2018, Threads was released by Severin_Films on Blu-Ray in the
United States. The programme was scanned in 2K from a broadcast print for this
release, including extras such as an audio commentary with Director Mick
Jackson and interviews with actress Karen Meagher, Director Of Photography
Andrew Dunn, Production Designer Christopher Robilliard and film writer Stephen
Thrower.[25][26] This is also the first home video release in which the extract
from the Alpine Symphony remains intact.
On 9 April 2018, Simply Media released a Special Edition DVD in the UK,
featuring a different 2K scan, restored and remastered from the original BBC
16mm CRI prints, which Severin did not have access to. This also featured the
original music, for the first time on home video in the UK. Whereas the
previous releases had no extra features, the Special Edition included
commentaries and associated documentaries.
***** Reception[edit] *****
Threads was not widely reviewed, but the critics who reviewed it gave generally
positive reviews.[27] John J. O'Connor of The_New_York_Times wrote that the
film "is not a balanced discussion about the pros and cons of nuclear
armaments. It is a candidly biased warning. And it is, as calculated,
unsettlingly powerful."[28] Rick Groen of The_Globe_and_Mail wrote that "[t]he
British crew here, headed by writer Barry Hines and producer/director Mick
Jackson, accomplish what would seem to be an impossible task: depicting the
carnage without distancing the viewer, without once letting him retreat behind
the safe wall of fictitious play. Formidable and foreboding, Threads leaves
nothing to our imagination, and Nothingness to our conscience."[29] In his
movie_guide, Leonard_Maltin gave the film a rating of three stars (out of a
possible four). He called Threads "Britain's answer to The_Day_After" and wrote
that the film was "unrelentingly graphic and grim, sobering, and shattering, as
it should be."[30]
Retrospective reviews have been very positive. On Metacritic, the film has a
score of 92 based on 5 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[31] Peter
Bradshaw of The_Guardian called it a "masterpiece", writing: "It wasnât until
I saw Threads that I found that something on screen could make me break out in
a cold, shivering sweat and keep me in that condition for 20 minutes, followed
by weeks of depression and anxiety."[32] Sam Toy of Empire gave the film a
perfect score, writing that "this British work of (technically) science_fiction
teaches an unforgettable lesson in true horror" and went on to praise its
ability "to create an almost impossible illusion on clearly paltry funds."[33]
Jonathan Hatfull of SciFiNow gave a perfect score to the remastered DVD of the
film. "No one ever forgets the experience of watching Threads. [...It] is
arguably the most devastating piece of television ever produced. Itâs
perfectly crafted, totally human and so completely harrowing youâll think
that youâll probably never want to watch it again." He praised the pacing and
Hines' "impeccable" screenplay and described its portrayal of the "immediate
effects" of the bombing as "jaw-dropping [...] watching the survivors in the
days and weeks to come is heart-breaking."[34]
***** Awards & Nominations[edit] *****
The film was nominated for seven BAFTA awards in 1985. It won for Best Single
Drama, Best Design, Best Film Cameraman and Best Film Editor. Its other
nominations were for Best Costume Design, Best Make-Up, and Best Film Sound.
