From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The glassâliquid transition, or glass transition, is the gradual and
reversible transition in amorphous materials (or in amorphous regions within
semicrystalline materials), from a hard and relatively brittle "glassy" state
into a viscous or rubbery state as the temperature is increased.[1] An
amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition is called a glass. The reverse
transition, achieved by supercooling a viscous_liquid into the glass state, is
called vitrification.
The glass-transition temperature Tg of a material characterizes the range of
temperatures over which this glass transition occurs. It is always lower than
the melting_temperature, Tm, of the crystalline state of the material, if one
exists.
Hard plastics like polystyrene and poly(methyl_methacrylate) are used well
below their glass transition temperatures, i.e., when they are in their glassy
state. Their Tg values are well above room temperature, both at around 100 Â°C
(212 Â°F). Rubber elastomers like polyisoprene and polyisobutylene are used
above their Tg, that is, in the rubbery state, where they are soft and
flexible.[2]
Despite the change in the physical properties of a material through its glass
transition, the transition is not considered a phase_transition; rather it is a
phenomenon extending over a range of temperature and defined by one of several
conventions.[3][4] Such conventions include a constant cooling rate (20 kelvins
per minute (36 Â°F/min))[1] and a viscosity threshold of 1012 PaÂ·s, among
others. Upon cooling or heating through this glass-transition range, the
material also exhibits a smooth step in the thermal-expansion_coefficient and
in the specific_heat, with the location of these effects again being dependent
on the history of the material.[5] The question of whether some phase
transition underlies the glass transition is a matter of continuing research.
[3][4][6] In a more recent model of glass transition, the glass transition
temperature corresponds to the temperature at which the largest openings
between the vibrating elements in the liquid matrix become smaller than the
smallest cross-sections of the elements or parts of them when the temperature
is decreasing. As a result of the fluctuating input of thermal energy into the
liquid matrix, the harmonics of the oscillations are constantly disturbed and
temporary cavities ("free volume") are created between the elements, the number
and size of which depend on the temperature. The glass transition temperature
Tg0 defined in this way is a fixed material constant of the disordered (non-
crystalline) state that is dependent only on the pressure. As a result of the
increasing inertia of the molecular matrix when approaching Tg0, the setting of
the thermal equilibrium is successively delayed, so that the usual measuring
methods for determining the glass transition temperature in principle deliver
Tg values that are too high. In principle, the slower the temperature change
rate is set during the measurement, the closer the measured Tg value Tg0
approaches.(Karl GÃ¼nter Sturm Microscopic-Phenomenological Model of Glass

IUPAC definition
glass transition (in polymer science): Process in which a polymer melt changes
on cooling to a polymer glass or a polymer glass changes on heating to a
polymer melt.[7]
Note 1: Phenomena occurring at the glass transition of polymers are still
subject to ongoing scientific investigation and debate. The glass transition
presents features of a second-order transition since thermal studies often
indicate that the molar Gibbs energies, molar enthalpies, and the molar volumes
of the two phases, i.e., the melt and the glass, are equal, while the heat
capacity and the expansivity are discontinuous. However, the glass transition
is generally not regarded as a thermodynamic transition in view of the inherent
difficulty in reaching equilibrium in a polymer glass or in a polymer melt at
temperatures close to the glass-transition temperature.
Note 2: In the case of polymers, conformational changes of segments, typically
consisting of 10â20 main-chain atoms, become infinitely slow below the glass
transition temperature.
Note 3: In a partially crystalline polymer the glass transition occurs only in
the amorphous parts of the material.
Note 4: The definition is different from that in ref.[8]
Note 5: The commonly used term âglass-rubber transitionâ for glass
transition is not recommended.[9]

***** Introduction[edit] *****
The glass transition of a liquid to a solid-like state may occur with either
cooling or compression.[10] The transition comprises a smooth increase in the
viscosity of a material by as much as 17 orders_of_magnitude within a
temperature range of 500 K without any pronounced change in material structure.
[11] The consequence of this dramatic increase is a glass exhibiting solid-like
mechanical properties on the timescale of practical observation[clarification
needed]. This transition is in contrast to the freezing or crystallization
transition, which is a first-order phase_transition in the Ehrenfest
classification and involves discontinuities in thermodynamic and dynamic
properties such as volume, energy, and viscosity. In many materials that
normally undergo a freezing transition, rapid cooling will avoid this phase
transition and instead result in a glass transition at some lower temperature.
Other materials, such as many polymers, lack a well defined crystalline state
and easily form glasses, even upon very slow cooling or compression. The
tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass forming
ability. This ability depends on the composition of the material and can be
predicted by the rigidity_theory.[12]
Below the transition temperature range, the glassy structure does not relax in
accordance with the cooling rate used. The expansion coefficient for the glassy
state is roughly equivalent to that of the crystalline solid. If slower cooling
rates are used, the increased time for structural relaxation (or intermolecular
rearrangement) to occur may result in a higher density glass product.
Similarly, by annealing (and thus allowing for slow structural relaxation) the
glass structure in time approaches an equilibrium density corresponding to the
supercooled liquid at this same temperature. Tg is located at the intersection
between the cooling curve (volume versus temperature) for the glassy state and
the supercooled liquid.[13][14][15][16][17]
The configuration of the glass in this temperature range changes slowly with
time towards the equilibrium structure. The principle of the minimization of
the Gibbs free energy provides the thermodynamic driving force necessary for
the eventual change. It should be noted here that at somewhat higher
temperatures than Tg, the structure corresponding to equilibrium at any
temperature is achieved quite rapidly. In contrast, at considerably lower
temperatures, the configuration of the glass remains sensibly stable over
increasingly extended periods of time.
Thus, the liquid-glass transition is not a transition between states of
thermodynamic_equilibrium. It is widely believed that the true equilibrium
state is always crystalline. Glass is believed to exist in a kinetically locked
state, and its entropy, density, and so on, depend on the thermal history.
Therefore, the glass transition is primarily a dynamic phenomenon. Time and
temperature are interchangeable quantities (to some extent) when dealing with
glasses, a fact often expressed in the timeâtemperature_superposition
principle. On cooling a liquid, internal degrees of freedom successively fall
out of equilibrium. However, there is a longstanding debate whether there is an
underlying second-order phase transition in the hypothetical limit of
infinitely long relaxation times.[clarification_needed][5][18][19][20]

Determination of Tg by dilatometry.
Measurement of Tg (the temperature at the point A) by differential scanning
calorimetry
Refer to the figure on the upper right plotting the heat capacity as a function
of temperature. In this context, Tg is the temperature corresponding to point A
on the curve. The linear sections below and above Tg are colored green. Tg is
the temperature at the intersection of the red regression lines.[21]
Different operational definitions of the glass transition temperature Tg are in
use, and several of them are endorsed as accepted scientific standards.
Nevertheless, all definitions are arbitrary, and all yield different numeric
results: at best, values of Tg for a given substance agree within a few
kelvins. One definition refers to the viscosity, fixing Tg at a value of 1013
poise (or 1012 PaÂ·s). As evidenced experimentally, this value is close to the
annealing_point of many glasses.[22]
In contrast to viscosity, the thermal_expansion, heat_capacity, shear modulus,
and many other properties of inorganic glasses show a relatively sudden change
at the glass transition temperature. Any such step or kink can be used to
define Tg. To make this definition reproducible, the cooling or heating rate
must be specified.
The most frequently used definition of Tg uses the energy release on heating in
differential_scanning_calorimetry (DSC, see figure). Typically, the sample is
first cooled with 10 K/min and then heated with that same speed.
Yet another definition of Tg uses the kink in dilatometry (a.k.a. thermal
expansion). Here, heating rates of 3â5 K/min (5.4â9.0 Â°F/min) are common.
Summarized below are Tg values characteristic of certain classes of materials.

***** Kauzmann's paradox[edit] *****
Entropy difference between crystal and undercooled melt
As a liquid is supercooled, the difference in entropy between the liquid and
solid phase decreases. By extrapolating the heat_capacity of the supercooled
liquid below its glass_transition_temperature, it is possible to calculate the
temperature at which the difference in entropies becomes zero. This temperature
has been named the Kauzmann temperature.
If a liquid could be supercooled below its Kauzmann temperature, and it did
indeed display a lower entropy than the crystal phase, the consequences would
be paradoxical. This Kauzmann paradox has been the subject of much debate and
many publications since it was first put forward by Walter_Kauzmann in 1948.
[34]
One resolution of the Kauzmann paradox is to say that there must be a phase
transition before the entropy of the liquid decreases. In this scenario, the
transition temperature is known as the calorimetric ideal glass transition
temperature T0c. In this view, the glass transition is not merely a kinetic
effect, i.e. merely the result of fast cooling of a melt, but there is an
underlying thermodynamic basis for glass formation. The glass transition
temperature:
          T  g   &#x2192;  T  0 c    &#xA0;as&#xA0;     d T   d t    &#x2192;
      0.   {\displaystyle T_{g}\to T_{0c}{\text{ as }}{\frac {dT}{dt}}\to 0.}
      [T_{g}\to T_{{0c}}{\text{ as }}{\frac  {dT}{dt}}\to 0.]
The Gibbs-DiMarzio model specifically predicts that a supercooled liquid's
configurational entropy disappears in the limit     T &#x2192;  T  K   +
{\displaystyle T\to T_{K}^{+}}  [{\displaystyle T\to T_{K}^{+}}], where the
liquid's existence regime ends, its microstructure becomes identical to the
crystal's, and their property curves intersect in a true second-order phase
transition. This has never been experimentally verified due to the difficulty
of realizing a slow enough cooling rate while avoiding accidental
crystallization.
**** Alternative resolutions[edit] ****
There are at least three other possible resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox. It
could be that the heat capacity of the supercooled liquid near the Kauzmann
temperature smoothly decreases to a smaller value. It could also be that a
first order phase transition to another liquid state occurs before the Kauzmann
temperature with the heat capacity of this new state being less than that
obtained by extrapolation from higher temperature. Finally, Kauzmann himself
resolved the entropy paradox by postulating that all supercooled liquids must
crystallize before the Kauzmann temperature is reached.
***** In specific materials[edit] *****
**** Silica, SiO2[edit] ****
Silica (the chemical compound SiO2) has a number of distinct crystalline forms
in addition to the quartz structure. Nearly all of the crystalline forms
involve tetrahedral SiO4 units linked together by shared vertices in different
arrangements. Si-O bond lengths vary between the different crystal forms. For
example, in Î±-quartz the bond length is 161 picometres (6.3Ã10â9 in),
whereas in Î±-tridymite it ranges from 154â171 pm
(6.1Ã10â9â6.7Ã10â9 in). The Si-O-Si bond angle also varies from 140Â°
in Î±-tridymite to 144Â° in Î±-quartz to 180Â° in Î²-tridymite. Any deviations
from these standard parameters constitute microstructural differences or
variations that represent an approach to an amorphous, vitreous or glassy
solid. The transition temperature Tg in silicates is related to the energy
required to break and re-form covalent bonds in an amorphous (or random
network) lattice of covalent_bonds. The Tg is clearly influenced by the
chemistry of the glass. For example, addition of elements such as B, Na, K or
Ca to a silica_glass, which have a valency less than 4, helps in breaking up
the network structure, thus reducing the Tg. Alternatively, P, which has a
valency of 5, helps to reinforce an ordered lattice, and thus increases the Tg.
[35]
Tg is directly proportional to bond strength, e.g. it depends on quasi-
equilibrium thermodynamic parameters of the bonds e.g. on the enthalpy Hd and
entropy Sd of configurons â broken bonds: Tg = Hd / [Sd + Rln[(1-fc)/ fc]
where R is the gas constant and fc is the percolation threshold. For strong
melts such as SiO2 the percolation threshold in the above equation is the
universal Scher-Zallen critical density in the 3-D space e.g. fc = 0.15,
however for fragile materials the percolation thresholds are material-dependent
and fc << 1.[36] The enthalpy Hd and the entropy Sd of configurons â broken
bonds can be found from available experimental data on viscosity.[37]
In ironing, a fabric is heated through the glass-rubber transition.
**** Polymers[edit] ****
In polymers the glass transition temperature, Tg, is often expressed as the
temperature at which the Gibbs_free_energy is such that the activation_energy
for the cooperative movement of 50 or so elements of the polymer is exceeded
[citation_needed]. This allows molecular chains to slide past each other when a
force is applied. From this definition, we can see that the introduction of
relatively stiff chemical groups (such as benzene rings) will interfere with
the flowing process and hence increase Tg.[38] The stiffness of thermoplastics
decreases due to this effect (see figure.) When the glass temperature has been
reached, the stiffness stays the same for a while, i.e., at or near E2, until
the temperature exceeds Tm, and the material melts. This region is called the
rubber plateau.
In ironing, a fabric is heated through this transition so that the polymer
chains become mobile. The weight of the iron then imposes a preferred
orientation. Tg can be significantly decreased by addition of plasticizers into
the polymer matrix. Smaller molecules of plasticizer embed themselves between
the polymer chains, increasing the spacing and free volume, and allowing them
to move past one another even at lower temperatures. The addition of
nonreactive side_groups to a polymer can also make the chains stand off from
one another, reducing Tg. If a plastic with some desirable properties has a Tg
that is too high, it can sometimes be combined with another in a copolymer or
composite_material with a Tg below the temperature of intended use. Note that
some plastics are used at high temperatures, e.g., in automobile engines, and
others at low temperatures.[25]
Stiffness versus temperature
In viscoelastic materials, the presence of liquid-like behavior depends on the
properties of and so varies with rate of applied load, i.e., how quickly a
force is applied. The silicone toy Silly_Putty behaves quite differently
depending on the time rate of applying a force: pull slowly and it flows,
acting as a heavily viscous liquid; hit it with a hammer and it shatters,
acting as a glass.
On cooling, rubber undergoes a liquid-glass transition, which has also been
called a rubber-glass transition.
***** Mechanics of vitrification[edit] *****
Main article: Vitrification
Molecular motion in condensed matter can be represented by a Fourier_series
whose physical interpretation consists of a superposition of longitudinal and
transverse waves of atomic displacement with varying directions and
wavelengths. In monatomic systems, these waves are called density fluctuations.
(In polyatomic systems, they may also include compositional fluctuations.)[39]
Thus, thermal_motion in liquids can be decomposed into elementary longitudinal
vibrations (or acoustic phonons) while transverse_vibrations (or shear waves)
were originally described only in elastic solids exhibiting the highly ordered
crystalline state of matter. In other words, simple liquids cannot support an
applied force in the form of a shearing_stress, and will yield mechanically via
macroscopic plastic_deformation (or viscous flow). Furthermore, the fact that a
solid deforms locally while retaining its rigidity â while a liquid yields to
macroscopic viscous_flow in response to the application of an applied shearing
force â is accepted by many as the mechanical distinction between the two.
[40][41]
The inadequacies of this conclusion, however, were pointed out by Frenkel in
his revision of the kinetic_theory_of_solids and the theory_of_elasticity in
liquids. This revision follows directly from the continuous characteristic of
the structural transition from the liquid state into the solid one when this
transition is not accompanied by crystallizationâergo the supercooled viscous
liquid. Thus we see the intimate correlation between transverse acoustic
phonons (or shear waves) and the onset of rigidity upon vitrification, as
described by Bartenev in his mechanical description of the vitrification
process.[42][43]
The velocities of longitudinal acoustic phonons in condensed matter are
directly responsible for the thermal_conductivity that levels out temperature
differentials between compressed and expanded volume elements. Kittel proposed
that the behavior of glasses is interpreted in terms of an approximately
constant "mean_free_path" for lattice phonons, and that the value of the mean
free path is of the order_of_magnitude of the scale of disorder in the
molecular structure of a liquid or solid. The thermal phonon mean free paths or
relaxation lengths of a number of glass formers have been plotted versus the
glass transition temperature, indicating a linear relationship between the two.
This has suggested a new criterion for glass formation based on the value of
the phonon mean free path.[44]
It has often been suggested that heat_transport in dielectric solids occurs
through elastic vibrations of the lattice, and that this transport is limited
by elastic scattering of acoustic phonons by lattice defects (e.g. randomly
spaced vacancies).[45] These predictions were confirmed by experiments on
commercial glasses and glass ceramics, where mean free paths were apparently
limited by "internal boundary scattering" to length scales of 10â100
micrometres (0.00039â0.00394 in).[46][47] The relationship between these
transverse waves and the mechanism of vitrification has been described by
several authors who proposed that the onset of correlations between such
phonons results in an orientational ordering or "freezing" of local shear
stresses in glass-forming liquids, thus yielding the glass transition.[48]
**** Electronic structure[edit] ****
The influence of thermal phonons and their interaction with electronic
structure is a topic that was appropriately introduced in a discussion of the
resistance of liquid metals. Lindemann's_theory_of_melting is referenced, and
it is suggested that the drop in conductivity in going from the crystalline to
the liquid state is due to the increased scattering of conduction electrons as
a result of the increased amplitude of atomic vibration. Such theories of
localization have been applied to transport in metallic_glasses, where the mean
free_path of the electrons is very small (on the order of the interatomic
spacing).[49][50]
The formation of a non-crystalline form of a gold-silicon alloy by the method
of splat_quenching from the melt led to further considerations of the influence
of electronic structure on glass forming ability, based on the properties of
the metallic_bond.[51][52][53][54][55]
Other work indicates that the mobility of localized electrons is enhanced by
the presence of dynamic phonon modes. One claim against such a model is that if
chemical_bonds are important, the nearly_free_electron_models should not be
applicable. However, if the model includes the buildup of a charge_distribution
between all pairs of atoms just like a chemical bond (e.g., silicon, when a
band is just filled with electrons) then it should apply to solids.[56]
Thus, if the electrical_conductivity is low, the mean_free_path of the
electrons is very short. The electrons will only be sensitive to the short-
range_order in the glass since they do not get a chance to scatter from atoms
spaced at large distances. Since the short-range order is similar in glasses
and crystals, the electronic energies should be similar in these two states.
For alloys with lower resistivity and longer electronic mean free paths, the
electrons could begin to sense[dubious  – discuss] that there is disorder in
the glass, and this would raise their energies and destabilize the glass with
respect to crystallization. Thus, the glass formation tendencies of certain
alloys may therefore be due in part to the fact that the electron mean free
paths are very short, so that only the short-range order is ever important for
the energy of the electrons.
It has also been argued that glass formation in metallic systems is related to
the "softness" of the interaction potential between unlike atoms. Some authors,
emphasizing the strong similarities between the local structure of the glass
and the corresponding crystal, suggest that chemical bonding helps to stabilize
the amorphous structure.[57][58]
Other authors have suggested that the electronic structure yields its influence
on glass formation through the directional properties of bonds. Non-
crystallinity is thus favored in elements with a large number of polymorphic
forms and a high degree of bonding anisotropy. Crystallization becomes more
unlikely as bonding anisotropy is increased from isotropic metallic to
anisotropic metallic to covalent bonding, thus suggesting a relationship
between the group_number in the periodic_table and the glass forming ability in
elemental solids.[59]
