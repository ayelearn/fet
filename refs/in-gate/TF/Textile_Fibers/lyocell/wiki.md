The label of a coat containing Tencel
Mattress with lyocell as cover material
Lyocell is a form of rayon which consists of cellulose fibre made from
dissolving_pulp (bleached wood pulp) using dry_jet-wet_spinning. It was
developed beginning in 1972 by a team at the now defunct American Enka fibers
facility at Enka,_North_Carolina. This development was recognised by the
American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) in 2003 by the
awarding of their Henry E. Millson Award for Invention. The operating name for
the fibre inside the Enka Organization was "Newcell", and the development was
carried through pilot plant scale before the work was stopped. The fibre was
developed further as Tencel in the 1980s by Courtaulds Fibres in Coventry, UK
and at the Grimsby,_UK_pilot_plant.[1] The process was first commercialised at
Courtaulds rayon factories at Mobile, Alabama (1990) and at the Grimsby plant
(1998). In 1998, Courtaulds was acquired by Akzo_Nobel, who combined the Tencel
division with other fibre divisions under the Accordis banner, prior to selling
them off to private equity (CVC Partners). In 2000, CVC sold the Tencel
division to Lenzing_AG, who combined it with their "Lenzing Lyocell" business
but maintained the brand name Tencel. As of 2017[update], Lenzing's Tencel
brand is perhaps the most widely known lyocell fiber producer throughout the
world.[2][citation_needed]
The US Federal_Trade_Commission defines Lyocell as a fibre "composed of
cellulose precipitated from an organic solution in which no substitution of the
hydroxyl groups takes place and no chemical intermediates are formed". It
classifies the fibre as a sub-category of rayon.[3] The fibre is used to make
textiles for clothing and other purposes.[4]

***** Uses[edit] *****
Shirt made from lyocell
As of 2010[update], Lyocell is more expensive_to_produce than cotton or viscose
rayon. It is used in many everyday fabrics. Staple_fibres are used in clothes
such as denim, chino, underwear, casual wear, and towels. Filament fibres,
which are generally longer and smoother than staple fibres,[5] are used in
items that have a silkier appearance such as women's clothing and men's dress
shirts. Lyocell can be blended with a variety of other fibres such as silk,
cotton, rayon, polyester, linen, nylon, and wool. Lyocell is also used in
conveyor_belts, specialty papers, and medical_dressings.[6]
***** Properties[edit] *****
Lyocell shares many properties with other cellulosic fibres such as cotton,
linen, ramie and viscose rayon. Some main characteristics of lyocell fibres are
that they are soft, absorbent, very strong when wet or dry, and resistant to
wrinkles. Lyocell fabric can be machine washed or drycleaned and can be dyed
many colors. It drapes well and can simulate a variety of textures such as
suede, leather, and silk.[7]
***** Manufacturing process[edit] *****
The Lyocell process uses a direct solvent rather than indirect dissolution like
the xanthation/regeneration route in the viscose process. Lyocell fiber is
produced from dissolving_pulp, which contains cellulose in high purity with
little hemicellulose and no lignin. Hardwood logs (such as oak and birch[8])
are chipped into squares about the size of postage stamps. The chips are
digested chemically either with the prehydrolysis-kraft_process or with sulfite
process to remove the lignin and hemicellulose. The pulp is bleached to remove
the remaining traces of lignin, dried into a continuous sheet and rolled onto
spools. The pulp has the consistency of thick posterboard paper and is
delivered in rolls weighing some 500 lb (230 kg).
      N-Methylmorpholine_N-oxide is a key solvent in the Lyocell Process.
At the Lyocell mill, rolls of pulp are broken into one-inch squares and
dissolved in N-methylmorpholine_N-oxide, giving a solution called "dope". The
filtered cellulose solution is then pumped through spinnerets, devices used
with a variety of man-made fibres. The spinneret is pierced with small holes
rather like a showerhead; when the solution is forced through it, continuous
strands of filament come out. The fibres are drawn in air to align the
cellulose molecules, giving the Lyocell fibres its characteristic high
strength. The fibres are then immersed into a water bath, where desolvation of
the cellulose sets the fibre strands; the bath contains some dilute amine oxide
in a steady state concentration. Then the fibres are washed with de-mineralised
water. The Lyocell fibre next passes to a drying area, where the water is
evaporated from it.
Manufacture then follows the same route as with other kinds of fibers such as
viscose. The strands pass to a finishing area, where a lubricant, which may be
a soap or silicone or other agent depending on the future use of the fibre, is
applied. This step is basically a detangler, prior to carding and spinning into
yarn. The dried, finished fibres are at this stage in a form called tow, a
large untwisted bundle of continuous lengths of filament. The bundles of tow
are taken to a crimper, a machine that compresses the fibre, giving it texture
and bulk. The crimped fibre is carded by mechanical carders, which perform an
action like combing, to separate and order the strands. The carded strands are
cut and baled for shipment to a fabric mill. The entire manufacturing process,
from unrolling the raw cellulose to baling the fibre, takes about two hours.
After this, the Lyocell may be processed in many ways. It may be spun with
another fibre, such as cotton or wool. The resulting yarn can be woven or
knitted like any other fabric, and may be given a variety of finishes, from
soft and suede-like to silky.[6]
The amine oxide used to dissolve the cellulose and set the fibre after spinning
is recycled. Ninety-eight percent of the amine oxide is typically recovered.
Since there is little waste product, this process is relatively eco-friendly.
