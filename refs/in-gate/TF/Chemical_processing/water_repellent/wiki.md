Waterproofing conducted on the exterior of a freeway tunnel
Waterproofing is the process of making an object or structure waterproof or
water-resistant so that it remains relatively unaffected by water or resisting
the ingress of water under specified conditions. Such items may be used in wet
environments or underwater to specified depths.
Water resistant and waterproof often refer to penetration of water in its
liquid state and possibly under pressure, whereas damp_proof refers to
resistance to humidity or dampness. Permeation of water_vapor through a
material or structure is reported as a moisture_vapor_transmission_rate (MVTR).
The hulls of boats and ships were once waterproofed by applying tar or pitch.
Modern items may be waterproofed by applying water-repellent coatings or by
sealing seams with gaskets or o-rings.
Waterproofing is used in reference to building structures (such as basements,
decks, or wet areas), watercraft, canvas, clothing (raincoats or waders),
electronic devices and paper packaging (such as cartons for liquids).

***** In construction[edit] *****
Further information: Weatherization and Basement_waterproofing
In construction, a building or structure is waterproofed with the use of
membranes and coatings to protect contents, and structural integrity. The
waterproofing of the building_envelope in construction specifications is listed
under 07 - Thermal and Moisture Protection within MasterFormat 2004, by the
Construction_Specifications_Institute, and includes roofing and waterproofing
materials.[citation_needed]
In building construction, waterproofing is a fundamental aspect of creating a
building_envelope, which is a controlled environment. The roof covering
materials, siding, foundations, and all of the various penetrations through
these surfaces must be water-resistant and sometimes waterproof. Roofing
materials are generally designed to be water-resistant and shed water from a
sloping roof, but in some conditions, such as ice_damming and on flat_roofs,
the roofing must be waterproof. Many types of waterproof membrane systems are
available, including felt_paper or tar_paper with asphalt or tar to make a
built-up roof, other bituminous_waterproofing, ethylene propylene diene monomer
EPDM_rubber, hypalon, polyvinyl_chloride, liquid_roofing, and more.
Walls are not subjected to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes
used as housewraps are designed to be porous enough to let moisture escape.
Walls also have vapor_barriers or air_barriers. Damp_proofing is another aspect
of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a damp-proof course to prevent
rising_damp, and the concrete in foundations needs to be damp-proofed or
waterproofed with a liquid coating, basement_waterproofing membrane (even under
the concrete slab floor where polyethylene sheeting is commonly used), or an
additive to the concrete.
Within the waterproofing industry, below-ground waterproofing is generally
divided into two areas:
Tanking: This is waterproofing used where the below-ground structure will be
sitting in the water table continuously or periodically. This causes
hydrostatic pressure on both the membrane and structure, and requires full
encapsulation of the basement structure in a tanking membrane, under slab and
walls.
Damp proofing: This is waterproofing used where the water table is lower than
the structure and there is good free-draining fill. The membrane deals with
shedding of water and the ingress of water vapor only, with no hydrostatic
pressure. Generally, this incorporates a damp proof membrane (DPM) to the walls
with a polythene DPM under slab. With higher grade DPM, some protection from
short-term Hydrostatic pressure can be gained by transitioning the higher
quality wall DPM to the slab polythene under footing, rather than at the
footing face.
In buildings using earth_sheltering, a potential problem is too much humidity,
so waterproofing is critical. Water seepage can lead to mold growth, causing
significant damage and air quality issues. Properly waterproofing foundation
walls is required to prevent deterioration and seepage.
Another specialized area of waterproofing is roof top decks and balconies.
Waterproofing systems have become quite sophisticated and are a very
specialized area. Failed waterproof decks, polymer or tile, are one of the
leading causes of water damage to building structures, and of personal injury
when they fail. Where major problems occur in the construction industry is when
improper products are used for the wrong application. While the term waterproof
is used for many products, each of them has a very specific area of
application, and when manufacturer specifications and installation procedures
are not followed, the consequences can be severe. Another factor, is the impact
of expansion and contraction on waterproofing systems for decks. Decks
constantly move with changes in temperatures, putting stress on the
waterproofing systems. One of the leading causes of waterproof deck system
failures is the movement of underlying substrates (plywood) that cause too much
stress on the membranes resulting in a failure of the system. While beyond the
scope of this reference document, waterproofing of decks and balconies is a
complex of many complimentary elements. These include the waterproofing
membrane used, adequate slope-drainage, proper flashing details, and proper
construction materials.
The penetrations through a building envelope must be built in a way such that
water does not enter the building, such as using flashing and special fittings
for pipes, vents, wires, etc. Some caulkings are durable, but many are
unreliable for waterproofing.
Also, many types of geomembranes are available to control water, gases, or
pollution.
From the late 1990s to the 2010s, the construction industry has had
technological advances in waterproofing materials, including integral
waterproofing systems and more advanced membrane materials. Integral systems
such as hycrete work within the matrix of a concrete structure, giving the
concrete itself a waterproof quality. There are two main types of integral
waterproofing systems: the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic systems. A
hydrophilic system typically uses a crystallisation technology that replaces
the water in the concrete with insoluble crystals. Various brands available in
the market claim similar properties, but not all can react with a wide range of
cement hydration by-products and thus require caution. Hydrophobic systems use
concrete_sealers or even fatty_acids to block pores within the concrete,
preventing water passage.
Sometimes the same materials used to keep water out of buildings are used to
keep water in, such as pool or pond_liners.
New membrane materials seek to overcome shortcomings in older methods like
polyvinyl_chloride (PVC) and high-density_polyethylene (HDPE). Generally, new
technology in waterproof membranes relies on polymer-based materials that are
very adhesive to create a seamless barrier around the outside of a structure.
Waterproofing should not be confused with roofing, since roofing cannot
necessarily withstand hydrostatic_head while waterproofing can.
The standards for waterproofing bathrooms in domestic construction have
improved over the years, due in large part to the general tightening of
building codes.
***** In clothing[edit] *****
Main article: Waterproof_fabric
Some garments, and tents, are designed to give greater or lesser protection
against rain. For urban use raincoats and jackets are used; for outdoor
activities in rough weather there is a range of hiking_apparel. Typical
descriptions are "showerproof", "water resistant", and "waterproof".[1] These
terms are not precisely defined. A showerproof garment will usually be treated
with a water-resisting coating, but is not rated to resist a specific
hydrostatic_head. This is suitable for protection against light rain, but after
a short time water will penetrate. A water-resistant garment is similar,
perhaps slightly more resistant to water but also not rated to resist a
specific hydrostatic head. A garment described as waterproof will have a water-
repellent coating, with the seams also taped to prevent water ingress there.
Better waterproof garments have a membrane lining designed to keep water out
but allow trapped moisture to escape ("breathability")âa totally waterproof
garment would retain body sweat and become clammy. Waterproof garments specify
their hydrostatic rating, ranging from 1,500 for light rain, to 20,000 for
heavy rain.
Waterproof garments are intended for use in weather conditions which are often
windy as well as wet, and are usually also wind resistant.
***** In other objects[edit] *****
Waterproofing methods have been implemented in many types of objects, including
paper packaging, cosmetics, and more recently, consumer electronics. Electronic
devices used in military and severe commercial environments are routinely
conformally coated in accordance with IPC-CC-830 to resist moisture and
corrosion but encapsulation is needed to become truly waterproof. Even though
it is possible to find waterproof wrapping or other types of protective cases
for electronic devices, a new technology enabled the release of diverse
waterproof smartphones and tablets in 2013.[2] This method is based on a
special nanotechnology coating a thousand times thinner than a human hair which
protects electronic equipment from damage due to the penetration of water.
Several manufacturers use the nano coating method on their smartphones,
tablets, and digital cameras.
A water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface
A 2013 study found that nanotextured_surfaces using cone forms produce highly
water-repellent surfaces. These nanocone textures are superhydrophobic
(extremely water-hating).[3][4]
