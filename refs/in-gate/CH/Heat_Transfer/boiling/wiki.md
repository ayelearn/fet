Type of vaporization; bulk phenomenon.

Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is
heated to its boiling_point, the temperature at which the vapour_pressure of
the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding
atmosphere. There are two main types of boiling: nucleate boiling where small
bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where
the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film
of vapor forms on the surface. Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable
form of boiling with elements of both types. The boiling point of water is
100 Â°C or 212 Â°F but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found
at higher altitudes.
Boiling water is used as a method of making it potable by killing microbes that
may be present. The sensitivity of different micro-organisms to heat varies,
but if water is held at 70 Â°C (158 Â°F) for ten minutes, many organisms are
killed, but some are more resistant to heat and require one minute at the
boiling point of water.
Boiling is also used in cooking. Foods suitable for boiling include vegetables,
starchy foods such as rice, noodles and potatoes, eggs, meats, sauces, stocks,
and soups. As a cooking method, it is simple and suitable for large-scale
cookery. Tough meats or poultry can be given a long, slow cooking and a
nutritious stock is produced. Disadvantages include loss of water-soluble
vitamins and minerals. Commercially prepared foodstuffs are sometimes packed in
polythene sachets and sold as "boil-in-the-bag" products.

***** Types[edit] *****
**** Nucleate[edit] ****
Nucleate boiling of water over a kitchen stove burner
Nucleate_boiling is characterized by the growth of bubbles or pops on a heated
surface, which rises from discrete points on a surface, whose temperature is
only slightly above the liquids. In general, the number of nucleation sites is
increased by an increasing surface temperature.
An irregular surface of the boiling vessel (i.e., increased surface roughness)
or additives to the fluid (i.e., surfactants and/or nanoparticles) facilitate
nucleate boiling over a broader temperature range[1][2][3], while an
exceptionally smooth surface, such as plastic, lends itself to superheating.
Under these conditions, a heated liquid may show boiling_delay and the
temperature may go somewhat above the boiling point without boiling.
**** Critical heat flux[edit] ****
Critical_heat_flux_(CHF) describes the thermal limit of a phenomenon where a
phase change occurs during heating (such as bubbles forming on a metal surface
used to heat water), which suddenly decreases the efficiency of heat_transfer,
thus causing localised overheating of the heating surface. As the boiling
surface is heated above a critical temperature, a film of vapor forms on the
surface. Since this vapor film is much less capable of carrying heat away from
the surface, the temperature rises very rapidly beyond this point into the
transition_boiling regime. The point at which this occurs is dependent on the
characteristics of boiling fluid and the heating surface in question.[2]
**** Transition[edit] ****
Transition_boiling may be defined as the unstable boiling, which occurs at
surface temperatures between the maximum attainable in nucleate and the minimum
attainable in film boiling.
The formation of bubbles in a heated liquid is a complex physical process which
often involves cavitation and acoustic effects, such as the broad-spectrum hiss
one hears in a kettle not yet heated to the point where bubbles boil to the
surface.
**** Film[edit] ****
Main article: Leidenfrost_effect
If a surface heating the liquid is significantly hotter than the liquid then
film boiling will occur, where a thin layer of vapor, which has low thermal
conductivity, insulates the surface. This condition of a vapor film insulating
the surface from the liquid characterizes film boiling.
***** Uses[edit] *****
**** For making water potable[edit] ****
As a method of disinfecting water, bringing it to its boiling point at 100 Â°C
(212 Â°F), is the oldest and most effective way since it does not affect the
taste, it is effective despite contaminants or particles present in it, and is
a single step process which eliminates most microbes responsible for causing
intestine related diseases.[4] Water's boiling point rests at around 100.0
degrees Celsius, when at an elevation of 0.[5] In places having a proper water
purification system, it is recommended only as an emergency treatment method or
for obtaining potable water in the wilderness or in rural areas, as it cannot
remove chemical_toxins or impurities.[6][7]
The elimination of micro-organisms by boiling follows first-order_kineticsâat
high temperatures, it is achieved in less time and at lower temperatures, in
more time. The heat sensitivity of micro-organisms varies, at 70 Â°C (158 Â°F),
Giardia species (causes Giardiasis) can take ten minutes for complete
inactivation, most intestine affecting microbes and E._coli (gastroenteritis)
take less than a minute; at boiling point, Vibrio_cholerae (cholera) takes ten
seconds and hepatitis_A_virus (causes the symptom of jaundice), one minute.
Boiling does not ensure the elimination of all micro-organisms; the bacterial
spores Clostridium can survive at 100 Â°C (212 Â°F) but are not water-borne or
intestine affecting. Thus for human health, complete sterilization of water is
not required.[4]
The traditional advice of boiling water for ten minutes is mainly for
additional safety, since microbes start getting eliminated at temperatures
greater than 60 Â°C (140 Â°F) and bringing it to its boiling point is also a
useful indication that can be seen without the help of a thermometer, and by
this time, the water is disinfected. Though the boiling_point_decreases with
increasing altitude, it is not enough to affect the disinfecting process.[4][8]

Boiling pasta
Boiling is the method of cooking food in boiling water or other water-based
liquids such as stock or milk.[9] Simmering is gentle boiling,[10] while in
poaching the cooking liquid moves but scarcely bubbles.
The boiling point of water is typically considered to be 100 Â°C or 212 Â°F.
Pressure and a change in the composition of the liquid may alter the boiling
point of the liquid. For this reason, high elevation cooking generally takes
longer since boiling point is a function of atmospheric_pressure. In Denver,
Colorado, USA, which is at an elevation of about one mile (1,600 m), water
boils at approximately 95 Â°C or 203 Â°F.[11] Depending on the type of food and
the elevation, the boiling water may not be hot enough to cook the food
properly. Similarly, increasing the pressure as in a pressure_cooker raises the
temperature of the contents above the open air boiling point.
Some science suggests adding a water-soluble substance, such as salt or sugar
also increases the boiling point. This is called boiling-point_elevation. At
palatable concentrations of salt, the effect is very small, and the boiling
point elevation is difficult to notice and this is why experiments to prove
this are considered inconclusive.[12] However, while making thick sugar syrup,
such as for Gulab_Jamun, one will notice boiling point elevation. Due to
variations in composition and pressure, the boiling point of water is almost
never exactly 100 Â°C, but rather close enough for cooking.
Boiling milk
Foods suitable for boiling include vegetables, starchy foods such as rice,
noodles and potatoes, eggs, meats, sauces, stocks, and soups.
Boiling has several advantages. It is safe and simple, and it is appropriate
for large-scale cookery. Older, tougher, cheaper cuts of meat and poultry can
be made digestible. Nutritious, well-flavored stock is produced. Also, maximum
color and nutritive_value is retained when cooking green vegetables, provided
boiling time is kept to the minimum.
Boiling food over a fireplace
On the other hand, there are several disadvantages. There is a loss of soluble
vitamins from foods to the water (if the water is discarded). Boiling can also
be a slow method of cooking food.
Boiling can be done in several ways: The food can be placed into already
rapidly boiling water and left to cook, the heat can be turned down and the
food can be simmered or the food can also be placed into the pot, and cold
water may be added to the pot. This may then be boiled until the food is
satisfactory.
Water on the outside of a pot, i.e., a wet pot, increases the time it takes the
pot of water to boil. The pot will heat at a normal rate once all excess water
on the outside of the pot evaporates.
Boiling is also often used to remove salt from certain foodstuffs, such as
bacon if a less saline product is required.
**** Boil-in-the-bag[edit] ****
Main article: Boil-in-bag
See also: Sous-vide
Also known as "boil-in-bag", this involves heating or cooking ready-made foods
sealed in a thick plastic bag. The bag containing the food, often frozen, is
submerged in boiling water for a prescribed time.[13] The resulting dishes can
be prepared with greater convenience as no pots or pans are dirtied in the
process. Such meals are available for camping as well as home dining.
***** Contrast with evaporation[edit] *****
At any given temperature, all the molecules in a liquid do not have the same
kinetic energy. Some high energy particles on the liquid surface may have
enough energy to escape the intermolecular forces of attraction of the liquid
and become a gas. This is called evaporation.
Evaporation only happens on the surface while boiling happens throughout the
liquid. When a liquid reaches its boiling point bubbles of gas form in it which
rise into the surface and burst into the air. This process is called boiling.
If the boiling liquid is heated more strongly the temperature does not rise but
the liquid boils more quickly.
This distinction is exclusive to the liquid-to-gas transition; any transition
directly from solid to gas is always referred to as sublimation regardless of
whether it is at its boiling point or not.
