****** Control valve ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
A control valve is a valve used to control fluid flow by varying the size of
the flow passage as directed by a signal from a controller.[1] This enables the
direct control of flow rate and the consequential control of process quantities
such as pressure, temperature, and liquid level.
In automatic_control terminology, a control valve is termed a "final control
element".

***** Operation[edit] *****
Air-actuated control valves each with a 4-20 mA "I to P" converter integral to
a valve positioner. In this example each positioner is comparing the valve stem
travel against control signal, and applying any correction.
The opening or closing of automatic control valves is usually done by
electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic_actuators. Normally with a modulating valve,
which can be set to any position between fully open and fully closed, valve
positioners are used to ensure the valve attains the desired degree of opening.
Air-actuated valves are commonly used because of their simplicity, as they only
require a compressed air supply, whereas electrically-operated valves require
additional cabling and switch gear, and hydraulically-actuated valves required
high pressure supply and return lines for the hydraulic fluid.
The pneumatic control signals are traditionally based on a pressure range of 3-
15psi (0.2-1.0 bar), or more commonly now, an electrical signal of 4-20mA for
industry, or 0-10V for HVAC systems. Electrical control now often includes a
"Smart" communication signal superimposed on the 4-20mA control current, such
that the health and verification of the valve position can be signalled back to
the controller. The HART, Fieldbus Foundation, and Profibus are the most common
protocols.
An automatic control valve consists of three main parts in which each part
exist in several types and designs:
    * Valve actuator - which moves the valve's modulating element, such as ball
      or butterfly.
    * Valve positioner - Which ensures the valve has reached the desired degree
      of opening. This overcomes the problems of friction and wear.
    * Valve body - in which the modulating element, a plug, globe, ball or
      butterfly, is contained.

era to the electronic era.

which will also feed back to the controller the actual valve position
Taking the example of an air-operated valve, there are two control actions
possible:
    * "Air or current to open" - The flow restriction decreases with increased
      control signal value.
    * "Air or current to close" - The flow restriction increases with increased
      control signal value.
There can also be failure_to_safety modes:
    * Air or control signal failure to close" - On failure of compressed air to
      the actuator, the valve closes under spring pressure or by backup power.
    * Air or control signal failure to open" - On failure of compressed air to
      actuator, the valve opens under spring pressure or by backup power.
The modes of failure operation are requirements of the failure_to_safety
process control specification of the plant. In the case of cooling water it may
be to fail open, and the case of delivering a chemical it may be to fail
closed.
***** Valve positioners[edit] *****
The fundamental function of a positioner is to deliver pressurized air to the
valve actuator, such that the position of the valve stem or shaft corresponds
to the set point from the control system. Positioners are typically used when a
valve requires throttling action. A positioner requires position feedback from
the valve stem or shaft and delivers pneumatic pressure to the actuator to open
and close the valve. The positioner must be mounted on or near the control
valve assembly. There are three main categories of positioners, depending on
the type of control signal, the diagnostic capability, and the communication
protocol: pneumatic analog and digital.[2]
Processing units may use pneumatic pressure signaling as the control set point
to the control valves. Pressure is typically modulated between 20.7 to 103 kPa
(3 to 15 psig) to move the valve from 0 to 100% position. In a common pneumatic
positioner the position of the valve stem or shaft is compared with the
position of a bellows that receives the pneumatic control signal. When the
input signal increases, the bellows expands and moves a beam. The beam pivots
about an input axis, which moves a flapper closer to the nozzle. The nozzle
pressure increases, which increases the output pressure to the actuator through
a pneumatic amplifier relay. The increased output pressure to the actuator
causes the valve stem to move. Stem movement is fed back to the beam by means
of a cam. As the cam rotates, the beam pivots about the feedback axis to move
the flapper slightly away from the nozzle. The nozzle pressure decreases and
reduces the output pressure to the actuator. Stem movement continues, backing
the flapper away from the nozzle until equilibrium is reached. When the input
signal decreases, the bellows contracts (aided by an internal range spring) and
the beam pivots about the input axis to move the flapper away from the nozzle.
Nozzle pressure decreases and the relay permits the release of diaphragm casing
pressure to the atmosphere, which allows the actuator stem to move upward.
Through the cam, stem movement is fed back to the beam to reposition the
flapper closer to the nozzle. When equilibrium conditions are obtained, stem
movement stops and the flapper is positioned to prevent any further decrease in
actuator pressure.[2]
The second type of positioner is an analog I/P positioner. Most modern
processing units use a 4 to 20 mA DC signal to modulate the control valves.
This introduces electronics into the positioner design and requires that the
positioner convert the electronic current signal into a pneumatic pressure
signal (current-to-pneumatic or I/P). In a typical analog I/P positioner, the
converter receives a DC input signal and provides a proportional pneumatic
output signal through a nozzle/flapper arrangement. The pneumatic output signal
provides the input signal to the pneumatic positioner. Otherwise, the design is
the same as the pneumatic positioner[2]
While pneumatic positioners and analog I/P positioners provide basic valve
position control, digital valve controllers add another dimension to positioner
capabilities. This type of positioner is a microprocessor-based instrument. The
microprocessor enables diagnostics and two-way communication to simplify setup
and troubleshooting.
In a typical digital valve controller, the control signal is read by the
microprocessor, processed by a digital algorithm, and converted into a drive
current signal to the I/P converter. The microprocessor performs the position
control algorithm rather than a mechanical beam, cam, and flapper assembly. As
the control signal increases, the drive signal to the I/P converter increases,
increasing the output pressure from the I/P converter. This pressure is routed
to a pneumatic amplifier relay and provides two output pressures to the
actuator. With increasing control signal, one output pressure always increases
and the other output pressure decreases
Double-acting actuators use both outputs, whereas single-acting actuators use
only one output. The changing output pressure causes the actuator stem or shaft
to move. Valve position is fed back to the microprocessor. The stem continues
to move until the correct position is attained. At this point, the
microprocessor stabilizes the drive signal to the I/P converter until
equilibrium is obtained.
In addition to the function of controlling the position of the valve, a digital
valve controller has two additional capabilities: diagnostics and two-way
digital communication.[2]
Widely used communication protocols include HART, FOUNDATION_fieldbus, and
PROFIBUS.
Advantages of placing a smart positioner on a control valve:
1. Automatic calibration and configuration of positioner. 2. Real time
diagnostics. 3. Reduced cost of loop commissioning, including installation and
calibration. 4. Use of diagnostics to maintain loop_performance levels. 5.
Improved process control accuracy that reduces process variability.
***** Types of control valve bodies[edit] *****
A huge variety of valve types and control operation exist. However, there are
two main forms of action; the sliding stem and the rotary action.
The most common and versatile types of control valves are sliding-stem globe,
V-notch ball, butterfly and angle types. Their popularity derives from rugged
construction and the many options available that make them suitable for a
variety of process applications.[3] Control valve bodies may be categorized as
below:[2]
