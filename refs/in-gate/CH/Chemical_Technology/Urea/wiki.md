Urea, also known as carbamide, is an organic_compound with chemical_formula CO
(NH2)2. This amide has two âNH2 groups joined by a carbonyl (C=O) functional
group.
Urea serves an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing
compounds by animals and is the main nitrogen-containing substance in the urine
of mammals. It is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and
practically non-toxic (LD50 is 15 g/kg for rats).[5] Dissolved in water, it is
neither acidic nor alkaline. The body uses it in many processes, most notably
nitrogen_excretion. The liver forms it by combining two ammonia molecules (NH3)
with a carbon_dioxide (CO2) molecule in the urea_cycle. Urea is widely used in
fertilizers as a source of nitrogen (N) and is an important raw_material for
the chemical_industry.
Friedrich_WÃ¶hler's discovery in 1828 that urea can be produced from inorganic
starting materials was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry. It
showed for the first time that a substance previously known only as a byproduct
of life could be synthesized in the laboratory without biological starting
materials thereby contradicting the widely held doctrine of vitalism.

***** Uses[edit] *****
**** Agriculture[edit] ****
A process plant in Bangladesh that commercially produces urea as fertilizer by
using methane as the main raw material.
More than 90% of world industrial production of urea is destined for use as a
nitrogen-release fertilizer.[6] Urea has the highest nitrogen content of all
solid nitrogenous fertilizers in common use. Therefore, it has the lowest
transportation costs per unit of nitrogen nutrient.
Many soil bacteria possess the enzyme urease, which catalyzes conversion of
urea to ammonia (NH3) or ammonium ion (NH4+) and bicarbonate ion (HCO3â).
Thus urea fertilizers rapidly transform to the ammonium form in soils. Among
the soil bacteria known to carry urease, some ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB),
such as species of Nitrosomonas, can also assimilate the carbon dioxide the
reaction releases to make biomass via the Calvin_cycle, and harvest energy by
oxidizing ammonia (the other product of urease) to nitrite, a process termed
nitrification.[7] Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, especially Nitrobacter, oxidize
nitrite to nitrate, which is extremely mobile in soils because of its negative
charge and is a major cause of water pollution from agriculture. Ammonium and
nitrate are readily absorbed by plants, and are the dominant sources of
nitrogen for plant growth. Urea is also used in many multi-component solid
fertilizer formulations. Urea is highly soluble in water and is therefore also
very suitable for use in fertilizer solutions (in combination with ammonium
nitrate: UAN), e.g., in 'foliar feed' fertilizers. For fertilizer use, granules
are preferred over prills because of their narrower particle size distribution,
which is an advantage for mechanical application.
The most common impurity of synthetic urea is biuret, which impairs plant
growth.
Urea is usually spread at rates of between 40 and 300 kg/ha but rates vary.
Smaller applications incur lower losses due to leaching. During summer, urea is
often spread just before or during rain to minimize losses from volatilization
(a process wherein nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere as ammonia gas).
Because of the high nitrogen concentration in urea, it is very important to
achieve an even spread. The application equipment must be correctly calibrated
and properly used. Drilling must not occur on contact with or close to seed,
due to the risk of germination damage. Urea dissolves in water for application
as a spray or through irrigation systems.
In grain and cotton crops, urea is often applied at the time of the last
cultivation before planting. In high rainfall areas and on sandy soils (where
nitrogen can be lost through leaching) and where good in-season rainfall is
expected, urea can be side- or top-dressed during the growing season. Top-
dressing is also popular on pasture and forage crops. In cultivating sugarcane,
urea is side-dressed after planting, and applied to each ratoon crop.
In irrigated crops, urea can be applied dry to the soil, or dissolved and
applied through the irrigation water. Urea dissolves in its own weight in
water, but becomes increasingly difficult to dissolve as the concentration
increases. Dissolving urea in water is endothermicâthe solution temperature
falls when urea dissolves.
As a practical guide, when preparing urea solutions for fertigation (injection
into irrigation lines), dissolve no more than 3 g urea per 1 L water.
In foliar sprays, urea concentrations of between 0.5% and 2.0% are often used
in horticultural crops. Low-biuret grades of urea are often indicated.
Urea absorbs moisture from the atmosphere and therefore is typically stored
either in closed or sealed bags on pallets or, if stored in bulk, under cover
with a tarpaulin. As with most solid fertilizers, storage in a cool, dry, well-
ventilated area is recommended.
Overdose or placing urea near seed is harmful.[8]
**** Chemical industry[edit] ****
Urea is a raw material for the manufacture of two main classes of materials:
urea-formaldehyde_resins and urea-melamine-formaldehyde used in marine plywood.
**** Explosives[edit] ****
Urea can be used to make urea_nitrate, a high_explosive that is used
industrially and as part of some improvised_explosive_devices. It is a
stabilizer in nitrocellulose explosives.
**** Automobile systems[edit] ****
Urea is used in SNCR and SCR reactions to reduce the NOx pollutants in exhaust
gases from combustion from Diesel, dual fuel, and lean-burn natural_gas
engines. The BlueTec system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution
into the exhaust system. The ammonia produced by the hydrolysis of the urea
reacts with the nitrogen oxide emissions and is converted into nitrogen and
water within the catalytic converter. Trucks and cars using these catalytic
converters need to carry a supply of diesel_exhaust_fluid, a solution of urea
in water.
**** Laboratory uses[edit] ****
Urea in concentrations up to 10 M is a powerful protein denaturant as it
disrupts the noncovalent bonds in the proteins. This property can be exploited
to increase the solubility of some proteins. A mixture of urea and choline
chloride is used as a deep_eutectic_solvent, a type of ionic_liquid.
Urea can in principle serve as a hydrogen source for subsequent power
generation in fuel_cells. Urea present in urine/wastewater can be used directly
(though bacteria normally quickly degrade urea.) Producing hydrogen by
electrolysis of urea solution occurs at a lower voltage (0.37 V) and thus
consumes less energy than the electrolysis of water (1.2 V).[9]
Urea in concentrations up to 8 M can be used to make fixed brain tissue
transparent to visible light while still preserving fluorescent signals from
labeled cells. This allows for much deeper imaging of neuronal processes than
previously obtainable using conventional one photon or two photon confocal
microscopes.[10]
**** Medical use[edit] ****
Urea-containing_creams are used as topical dermatological products to promote
rehydration of the skin. Urea 40% is indicated for psoriasis, xerosis,
onychomycosis, ichthyosis, eczema, keratosis, keratoderma, corns, and calluses.
If covered by an occlusive_dressing, 40% urea preparations may also be used for
nonsurgical debridement of nails. Urea 40% "dissolves the intercellular matrix"
[11] of the nail plate. Only diseased or dystrophic nails are removed, as there
is no effect on healthy portions of the nail.[citation_needed] This drug is
also used as an earwax removal aid.[citation_needed]
Urea has also been studied as a diuretic. It was first used Dr. W. Friedrich in
1892.[12] In a 2010 study of ICU patients, urea was used to treat euvolemic
hyponatremia and was found safe, inexpensive, and simple.[13]
Like saline, urea injection has previously been used to perform abortion.[14]
The blood_urea_nitrogen (BUN) test is a measure of the amount of nitrogen in
the blood that comes from urea. It is used as a marker of renal_function,
though it is inferior to other markers such as creatinine because blood urea
levels are influenced by other factors such as diet and dehydration.[15]
Urea has also been studied as an excipient in Drug-coated Balloon (DCB) coating
formulation to enhance local drug delivery to stenotic blood vessels. [16][17]
Urea, when used as an excipient in small doses (~3Î¼g/mm2) to coat DCB surface
was found to form crystals that increase drug transfer without adverse toxic
effects on vascular endothelial_cells.[18]
Urea labeled with carbon-14 or carbon-13 is used in the urea_breath_test, which
is used to detect the presence of the bacterium Helicobacter_pylori (H. pylori)
in the stomach and duodenum of humans, associated with peptic_ulcers. The test
detects the characteristic enzyme urease, produced by H. pylori, by a reaction
that produces ammonia from urea. This increases the pH (reduces the acidity) of
the stomach environment around the bacteria. Similar bacteria species to H.
pylori can be identified by the same test in animals such as apes, dogs, and
cats (including big_cats).

***** Adverse effects[edit] *****
Urea can be irritating to skin, eyes, and the respiratory tract. Repeated or
prolonged contact with urea in fertilizer form on the skin may cause
dermatitis.[citation_needed]
High concentrations in the blood can be damaging. Ingestion of low
concentrations of urea, such as are found in typical human urine, are not
dangerous with additional water ingestion within a reasonable time-frame. Many
animals (e.g., dogs) have a much more concentrated urine and it contains a
higher urea amount than normal human urine; this can prove dangerous as a
source of liquids for consumption in a life-threatening situation (such as in a
desert).
Urea can cause algal_blooms to produce toxins, and its presence in the runoff
from fertilized land may play a role in the increase of toxic blooms.[24]
The substance decomposes on heating above melting point, producing toxic gases,
and reacts violently with strong oxidants, nitrites, inorganic chlorides,
chlorites and perchlorates, causing fire and explosion.[25]
***** Physiology[edit] *****
Amino acids from ingested food that are not used for the synthesis of proteins
and other biological substances â or produced from catabolism of muscle
protein â are oxidized by the body as an alternative source of energy,
yielding urea and carbon_dioxide.[26] The oxidation pathway starts with the
removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into
the urea_cycle. The first step in the conversion of amino acids from protein
into metabolic_waste in the liver is removal of the alpha-amino nitrogen, which
results in ammonia. Because ammonia is toxic, it is excreted immediately by
fish, converted into uric_acid by birds, and converted into urea by mammals.
[27]
Ammonia (NH3) is a common byproduct of the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds.
Ammonia is smaller, more volatile and more mobile than urea. If allowed to
accumulate, ammonia would raise the pH in cells to toxic levels. Therefore,
many organisms convert ammonia to urea, even though this synthesis has a net
energy cost. Being practically neutral and highly soluble in water, urea is a
safe vehicle for the body to transport and excrete excess nitrogen.
Urea is synthesized in the body of many organisms as part of the urea_cycle,
either from the oxidation of amino_acids or from ammonia. In this cycle, amino
groups donated by ammonia and L-aspartate are converted to urea, while L-
ornithine, citrulline, L-argininosuccinate, and L-arginine act as
intermediates. Urea production occurs in the liver and is regulated by N-
acetylglutamate. Urea is then dissolved into the blood (in the reference_range
of 2.5 to 6.7 mmol/liter) and further transported and excreted by the kidney as
a component of urine. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along
with sodium_chloride and water) in sweat.
In water, the amine groups undergo slow displacement by water molecules,
producing ammonia, ammonium_ion, and bicarbonate_ion. For this reason, old,
stale urine has a stronger odor than fresh urine.
**** Humans[edit] ****
The cycling_of_and_excretion_of_urea_by_the_kidneys is a vital part of
mammalian metabolism. Besides its role as carrier of waste nitrogen, urea also
plays a role in the countercurrent_exchange_system of the nephrons, that allows
for re-absorption of water and critical ions from the excreted urine. Urea is
reabsorbed in the inner_medullary_collecting_ducts of the nephrons,[28] thus
raising the osmolarity in the medullary interstitium surrounding the thin
descending_limb_of_the_loop_of_Henle, which makes the water reabsorb.
By action of the urea_transporter_2, some of this reabsorbed urea eventually
flows back into the thin descending limb of the tubule,[29] through the
collecting ducts, and into the excreted urine. The body uses this mechanism,
which is controlled by the antidiuretic_hormone, to create hyperosmotic
urineâi.e., urine with a higher concentration of dissolved substances than
the blood_plasma. This mechanism is important to prevent the loss of water,
maintain blood_pressure, and maintain a suitable concentration of sodium ions
in the blood plasma.
The equivalent nitrogen content (in gram) of urea (in mmol) can be estimated by
the conversion factor 0.028 g/mmol.[30] Furthermore, 1 gram of nitrogen is
roughly equivalent to 6.25 grams of protein, and 1 gram of protein is roughly
equivalent to 5 grams of muscle tissue. In situations such as muscle_wasting,
1 mmol of excessive urea in the urine (as measured by urine volume in litres
multiplied by urea concentration in mmol/l) roughly corresponds to a muscle
loss of 0.67 gram.
**** Other species[edit] ****
In aquatic organisms the most common form of nitrogen waste is ammonia, whereas
land-dwelling organisms convert the toxic ammonia to either urea or uric_acid.
Urea is found in the urine of mammals and amphibians, as well as some fish.
Birds and saurian reptiles have a different form of nitrogen metabolism that
requires less water, and leads to nitrogen excretion in the form of uric acid.
It is noteworthy that tadpoles excrete ammonia but shift to urea production
during metamorphosis. Despite the generalization above, the urea pathway has
been documented not only in mammals and amphibians but in many other organisms
as well, including birds, invertebrates, insects, plants, yeast, fungi, and
even microorganisms.[citation_needed]
***** Analysis[edit] *****
Urea is readily quantified by a number of different methods, such as the
diacetyl monoxime colorimetric method, and the Berthelot reaction (after
initial conversion of urea to ammonia via urease). These methods are amenable
to high throughput instrumentation, such as automated flow injection analyzers
[31] and 96-well micro-plate spectrophotometers.[32]
***** Related compounds[edit] *****
Main article: ureas
Ureas describes a class of chemical_compounds that share the same functional
group, a carbonyl group attached to two organic amine residues:
RR'NâCOâNRR'. Examples include carbamide_peroxide, allantoin, and
hydantoin. Ureas are closely related to biurets and related in structure to
amides, carbamates, carbodiimides, and thiocarbamides.
***** History[edit] *****
Urea was first discovered in urine in 1727 by the Dutch scientist Herman
Boerhaave,[33] although this discovery is often attributed to the French
chemist Hilaire_Rouelle.[34]
Boerhaave used the following steps to isolate urea:[35][36]
   1. Boiled off water, resulting in a substance similar to fresh cream
   2. Used filter paper to squeeze out remaining liquid
   3. Waited a year for solid to form under an oily liquid
   4. Removed the oily liquid
   5. Dissolved the solid in water
   6. Used recrystallization to tease out the urea
In 1828, the German chemist Friedrich_WÃ¶hler obtained urea artificially by
treating silver_cyanate with ammonium_chloride.[37][38][39]
      AgNCO + NH4Cl â (NH2)2CO + AgCl
This was the first time an organic compound was artificially synthesized from
inorganic starting materials, without the involvement of living organisms. The
results of this experiment implicitly discredited vitalism â the theory that
the chemicals of living organisms are fundamentally different from those of
inanimate matter. This insight was important for the development of organic
chemistry. His discovery prompted WÃ¶hler to write triumphantly to Berzelius:
"I must tell you that I can make urea without the use of kidneys, either man or
dog. Ammonium_cyanate is urea." In fact, this was incorrect. These are two
different chemicals, which are in chemical equilibrium heavily favoring urea
under standard_conditions.[40] Regardless, with his discovery, WÃ¶hler secured
a place among the pioneers of organic chemistry.
***** Production[edit] *****
Urea is produced on an industrial scale: In 2012, worldwide production capacity
was approximately 184 million tonnes.[41]
**** Industrial methods[edit] ****
For use in industry, urea is produced from synthetic ammonia and carbon
dioxide. As large quantities of carbon dioxide are produced during the ammonia
manufacturing process as a byproduct from hydrocarbons (predominantly natural
gas, less often petroleum derivatives), or occasionally from coal, urea
production plants are almost always located adjacent to the site where the
ammonia is manufactured. Although natural gas is both the most economical and
the most widely available ammonia plant feedstock, plants using it do not
produce quite as much carbon dioxide from the process as is needed to convert
their entire ammonia output into urea. In recent years new technologies such as
the KM-CDR process[42][43] have been developed to recover supplementary carbon
dioxide from the combustion exhaust gases produced in the fired reforming
furnace of the ammonia synthesis gas plant, allowing operators of stand-alone
nitrogen fertilizer complexes to avoid the need to handle and market ammonia as
a separate product and also to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to the
atmosphere.
*** Synthesis[edit] ***
Urea plant using ammonium carbamate briquettes, Fixed Nitrogen Research
Laboratory, ca. 1930
The basic process, developed in 1922, is also called the BoschâMeiser urea
process after its discoverers. Various commercial urea processes are
characterized by the conditions under which urea forms and the way that
unconverted reactants are further processed. The process consists of two main
equilibrium_reactions, with incomplete conversion of the reactants. The first
is carbamate formation: the fast exothermic reaction of liquid ammonia with
gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) at high temperature and pressure to form ammonium
carbamate (H2N-COONH4):[44]
      2 NH3 + CO2 â H2N-COONH4 (ÎH= -117kJ/mol at 110 atm and 160Â°C) [45]
The second is urea conversion: the slower endothermic decomposition of ammonium
carbamate into urea and water:
      H2N-COONH4 â (NH2)2CO + H2O (ÎH= +15.5 kJ/mol at 160-180Â°C) [45]
The overall conversion of NH3 and CO2 to urea is exothermic,[6] the reaction
heat from the first reaction driving the second. Like all chemical equilibria,
these reactions behave according to Le_Chatelier's_principle, and the
conditions that most favour carbamate formation have an unfavourable effect on
the urea conversion equilibrium. The process conditions are, therefore, a
compromise: the ill-effect on the first reaction of the high temperature
(around 190 Â°C) needed for the second is compensated for by conducting the
process under high pressure (140â175 bar), which favours the first reaction.
Although it is necessary to compress gaseous carbon dioxide to this pressure,
the ammonia is available from the ammonia plant in liquid form, which can be
pumped into the system much more economically. To allow the slow urea formation
reaction time to reach equilibrium a large reaction space is needed, so the
synthesis reactor in a large urea plant tends to be a massive pressure vessel.
Because the urea conversion is incomplete, the product must be separated from
unchanged ammonium carbamate. In early "straight-through" urea plants this was
done by letting down the system pressure to atmospheric to let the carbamate
decompose back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Originally, because it was not
economic to recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for recycle, the ammonia
at least would be used for the manufacture of other products, for example
ammonium_nitrate or sulfate. (The carbon dioxide was usually wasted.) Later
process schemes made recycling unused ammonia and carbon dioxide practical.
This was accomplished by depressurizing the reaction solution in stages (first
to 18â25 bar and then to 2â5 bar) and passing it at each stage through a
steam-heated carbamate decomposer, then recombining the resultant carbon
dioxide and ammonia in a falling-film carbamate condenser and pumping the
carbamate solution into the previous stage.
** The stripping concept[edit] **
The "total recycle" concept has two main disadvantages. The first is the
complexity of the flow scheme and, consequently, the amount of process
equipment needed. The second is the amount of water recycled in the carbamate
solution, which has an adverse effect on the equilibrium in the urea conversion
reaction and thus on overall plant efficiency. The stripping concept, developed
in the early 1960s by Stamicarbon in The Netherlands, addressed both problems.
It also improved heat recovery and reuse in the process.
The position of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition
depends on the product of the partial_pressures of the reactants. In the total
recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall
pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon
dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering
the overall pressureâby suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the
reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with
the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first
routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate decomposer that
operates under full system pressure and is configured to provide maximum gas-
liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure
over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also
under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate
liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure
stage of the total recycle process altogether.
The stripping concept was such a major advance that competitors such as
Snamprogettiânow Saipemâ(Italy), the former Montedison (Italy), Toyo
Engineering_Corporation (Japan), and Urea_Casale (Switzerland) all developed
versions of it. Today, effectively all new urea plants use the principle, and
many total recycle urea plants have converted to a stripping process. No one
has proposed a radical alternative to the approach. The main thrust of
technological development today, in response to industry demands for ever
larger individual plants, is directed at re-configuring and re-orientating
major items in the plant to reduce size and overall height of the plant, and at
meeting challenging environmental performance targets.[46][47]
** Side reactions[edit] **
It is fortunate that the urea conversion reaction is slow. If it were not it
would go into reverse in the stripper. As it is, succeeding stages of the
process must be designed to minimize residence times, at least until the
temperature reduces to the point where the reversion reaction is very slow.
Two reactions produce impurities. Biuret is formed when two molecules of urea
combine with the loss of a molecule of ammonia.
      2 NH2CONH2 â H2NCONHCONH2 + NH3
Normally this reaction is suppressed in the synthesis reactor by maintaining an
excess of ammonia, but after the stripper, it occurs until the temperature is
reduced. Biuret is undesirable in fertilizer urea because it is toxic to crop
plants, although to what extent depends on the nature of the crop and the
method of application of the urea.[48] (Biuret is actually welcome in urea when
is used as a cattle feed supplement).
Isocyanic_acid results from the thermal decomposition of ammonium_cyanate,
which is in chemical_equilibrium with urea:
      NH2CONH2 â NH4NCO â HNCO + NH3
This reaction is at its worst when the urea solution is heated at low pressure,
which happens when the solution is concentrated for prilling or granulation
(see below). The reaction products mostly volatilize into the overhead vapours,
and recombine when these condense to form urea again, which contaminates the
process condensate.
** Corrosion[edit] **
Ammonium_carbamate solutions are notoriously corrosive to metallic construction
materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steelâespecially in the
hottest parts of the plant such as the stripper. Historically corrosion has
been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuous injection of a small
amount of oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive
oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide
feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen
that can mingle with passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to
accumulate.
In the mid 1990s two duplex (ferritic-austenitic) stainless steels were
introduced (DP28W, jointly developed by Toyo_Engineering and Sumitomo_Metals
Industries[49] and Safurex, jointly developed by Stamicarbon and Sandvik
Materials_Technology (Sweden).[50][51]) These let manufactures drastically
reduce the amount of passivation oxygen. In theory, they could operate with no
oxygen.
Saipem now uses either zirconium stripper tubes, or bimetallic tubes with a
titanium body (cheaper but less erosion-resistant) and a metallurgically bonded
internal zirconium lining. These tubes are fabricated by ATI_Wah_Chang (USA)
using its Omegabond technique.[52]
*** Finishing[edit] ***
Urea can be produced as prills, granules, pellets, crystals, and solutions.
** Solid forms[edit] **
For its main use as a fertilizer urea is mostly marketed in solid form, either
as prills or granules. The advantage of prills is that, in general, they can be
produced more cheaply than granules and that the technique was firmly
established in industrial practice long before a satisfactory urea granulation
process was commercialized. However, on account of the limited size of
particles that can be produced with the desired degree of sphericity and their
low crushing and impact strength, the performance of prills during bulk
storage, handling and use is generally (with some exceptions[53]) considered
inferior to that of granules.
High-quality compound fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated with other
components such as phosphates have been produced routinely since the beginnings
of the modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and
hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology
to granulate urea on its own.[54] But at the end of the 1970s three companies
began to develop fluidized-bed granulation. The first in the field was
Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now
Yara_International).[55] Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde_GmbH,
whose Uhde_Fertilizer_Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the
same time Toyo_Engineering_Corporation developed its spouted-bed process,
comprising a fluidized bed deliberately agitated to produce turbulent
ebullation.[56] Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own
fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than atomizing
sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there
was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro
(UFT) process.[57] As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now
commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a
different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally
from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This
organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel
longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough not to require screens.
[58]
Surprisingly, perhaps, considering the product particles are not spherical,
pastillation using a Rotoform steel-belt pastillator is gaining ground as a
urea particle-forming process as a result of development work by Stamicarbon in
collaboration with Sandvik_Process_Systems (Germany). Single-machine capacity
is limited to 175 t/d, but the machines are simple and need little maintenance,
specific power consumption is much lower than for granulation, and the product
is very uniform. The robustness of the product appears to make up for its non-
spherical shape.[59][60]
** UAN solutions[edit] **
In admixture, the combined solubility of ammonium nitrate and urea is so much
higher than that of either component alone that it is possible to obtain a
stable solution (known as UAN) with a total nitrogen content (32%) approaching
that of solid ammonium nitrate (33.5%), though not, of course, that of urea
itself (46%). Given the ongoing safety and security concerns surrounding
fertilizer-grade solid ammonium nitrate, UAN provides a considerably safer
alternative without entirely sacrificing the agronomic properties that make
ammonium nitrate more attractive than urea as a fertilizer in areas with short
growing seasons. It is also more convenient to store and handle than a solid
product and easier to apply accurately to the land by mechanical means.[61][62]
**** Laboratory preparation[edit] ****
Ureas in the more general sense can be accessed in the laboratory by reaction
of phosgene with primary or secondary amines, proceeding through an isocyanate
intermediate. Non-symmetric ureas can be accessed by reaction of primary or
secondary amines with an isocyanate.
Also, urea is produced when phosgene reacts with ammonia:
      COCl2 + 4 NH3 â (NH2)2CO + 2 NH4Cl
Urea is byproduct of converting alkyl halides to thiols via a S-alkylation of
thiourea. Such reactions proceed via the intermediacy of isothiouronium_salts:
      RX + CS(NH2)2 â RSCX(NH2)2X
      RSCX(NH2)2X + MOH â RSH + (NH2)2CO + MX
In this reaction R is alkyl group, X is halogen and M is alkali metal.
**** Historical process[edit] ****
Urea was first noticed by Herman_Boerhaave in the early 18th century from
evaporates of urine. In 1773, Hilaire_Rouelle obtained crystals containing urea
from human urine by evaporating it and treating it with alcohol in successive
filtrations.[63] This method was aided by Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele's discovery that
urine treated by concentrated nitric_acid precipitated crystals. Antoine
FranÃ§ois,_comte_de_Fourcroy and Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin discovered in 1799
that the nitrated crystals were identical to Rouelle's substance and invented
the term "urea."[64][65] Berzelius made further improvements to its
purification[66] and finally William_Prout, in 1817, succeeded in obtaining and
determining the chemical composition of the pure substance.[67] In the evolved
procedure, urea was precipitated as urea nitrate by adding strong nitric acid
to urine. To purify the resulting crystals, they were dissolved in boiling
water with charcoal and filtered. After cooling, pure crystals of urea nitrate
form. To reconstitute the urea from the nitrate, the crystals are dissolved in
warm water, and barium_carbonate added. The water is then evaporated and
anhydrous alcohol added to extract the urea. This solution is drained off and
evaporated, leaving pure urea.
***** Chemical properties[edit] *****
**** Molecular and crystal structure[edit] ****
The urea molecule is planar in the crystal structure, but the geometry around
the nitrogen atoms is pyramidal in the gas-phase minimum-energy structure.[68]
In solid urea, the oxygen center is engaged in two N-H-O hydrogen_bonds. The
resulting dense and energetically favourable hydrogen-bond network is probably
established at the cost of efficient molecular packing: The structure is quite
open, the ribbons forming tunnels with square cross-section. The carbon in urea
is described as sp2 hybridized, the C-N bonds have significant double bond
character, and the carbonyl oxygen is basic compared to, say, formaldehyde.
Urea's high aqueous solubility reflects its ability to engage in extensive
hydrogen bonding with water.
By virtue of its tendency to form porous frameworks, urea has the ability to
trap many organic compounds. In these so-called clathrates, the organic "guest"
molecules are held in channels formed by interpenetrating helices composed of
hydrogen-bonded urea molecules. This behaviour can be used to separate
mixtures, e.g., in the production of aviation_fuel and lubricating_oils, and in
the separation of hydrocarbons.
As the helices are interconnected, all helices in a crystal must have the same
molecular_handedness. This is determined when the crystal is nucleated and can
thus be forced by seeding. The resulting crystals have been used to separate
racemic_mixtures.
**** Reactions[edit] ****
Urea dissolved in water is in equilibrium with the isomeric ammonium_cyanate.
[69] The resulting activity of the isocyanic_acid ions do result in
carbamylation (formation of long-chain carbamides, liberating ammonia molecule
as byproduct) of proteins if proteins are present in the solution too. The
carbamylation reaction may occur at elevated temperatures even without
catalysts. At room temperature, water solutions of urea are prone to same
decomposition reaction in the presence of urease. The isomerization of urea in
solution at room temperature without catalysts is a slow process (taking days
to reach equilibrium), and freshly prepared, unheated solutions had negligible
carbamylation rates.[70]
Urea reacts with alcohols to form urethanes.
Urea reacts with malonic esters to make barbituric_acids.
