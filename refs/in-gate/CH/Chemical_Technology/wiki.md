Chemical engineers design, construct and operate process plants (fractionating
columns pictured)
Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering that uses principles of
chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, and economics to efficiently use,
produce, design, transport and transform energy and materials. The work of
chemical engineers can range from the utilisation of nano-technology and nano-
materials in the laboratory to large-scale industrial processes that convert
chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful
forms and products.
Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation,
including safety and hazard assessments, process_design and analysis, modeling,
control_engineering, chemical_reaction_engineering, nuclear_engineering,
biological_engineering, construction specification, and operating instructions.
Chemical engineers typically hold a degree in Chemical Engineering or Process
Engineering. Practising engineers may have professional certification and be
accredited members of a professional body. Such bodies include the Institution
of_Chemical_Engineers (IChemE) or the American_Institute_of_Chemical_Engineers
(AIChE). A degree in chemical engineering is directly linked with all of the
other engineering disciplines, to various extents.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
George_E._Davis
A 1996 British_Journal_for_the_History_of_Science article cites James F.
Donnelly for mentioning an 1839 reference to chemical engineering in relation
to the production of sulfuric_acid.[1] In the same paper however, George_E.
Davis, an English consultant, was credited for having coined the term.[2] Davis
also tried to found a Society of Chemical Engineering, but instead it was named
the Society_of_Chemical_Industry (1881), with Davis as its first Secretary.[3]
[4] The History of Science in United States: An Encyclopedia puts the use of
the term around 1890.[5] "Chemical engineering", describing the use of
mechanical equipment in the chemical industry, became common vocabulary in
England after 1850.[6] By 1910, the profession, "chemical engineer," was
already in common use in Britain and the United States.[7]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_chemical_engineering
Chemical engineering emerged upon the development of unit_operations, a
fundamental concept of the discipline of chemical engineering. Most authors
agree that Davis invented the concept of unit operations if not substantially
developed it.[8] He gave a series of lectures on unit operations at the
Manchester_Technical_School (later part of the University_of_Manchester) in
1887, considered to be one of the earliest such about chemical engineering.[9]
Three years before Davis' lectures, Henry_Edward_Armstrong taught a degree
course in chemical engineering at the City_and_Guilds_of_London_Institute.
Armstrong's course failed simply because its graduates were not especially
attractive to employers. Employers of the time would have rather hired chemists
and mechanical_engineers.[5] Courses in chemical engineering offered by
Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology (MIT) in the United States, Owens_College
in Manchester, England, and University_College_London suffered under similar
circumstances.[10]
Students inside an industrial chemistry laboratory at MIT
Starting from 1888,[11] Lewis_M._Norton taught at MIT the first chemical
engineering course in the United States. Norton's course was contemporaneous
and essentially similar to Armstrong's course. Both courses, however, simply
merged chemistry and engineering subjects along with product design. "Its
practitioners had difficulty convincing engineers that they were engineers and
chemists that they were not simply chemists."[5] Unit operations was introduced
into the course by William_Hultz_Walker in 1905.[12] By the early 1920s, unit
operations became an important aspect of chemical engineering at MIT and other
US universities, as well as at Imperial_College_London.[13] The American
Institute_of_Chemical_Engineers (AIChE), established in 1908, played a key role
in making chemical engineering considered an independent science, and unit
operations central to chemical engineering. For instance, it defined chemical
engineering to be a "science of itself, the basis of which is ... unit
operations" in a 1922 report; and with which principle, it had published a list
of academic institutions which offered "satisfactory" chemical engineering
courses.[14] Meanwhile, promoting chemical engineering as a distinct science in
Britain led to the establishment of the Institution_of_Chemical_Engineers
(IChemE) in 1922.[15] IChemE likewise helped make unit operations considered
essential to the discipline.[16]
**** New concepts and innovations[edit] ****

is the layered cube shape in the center of the image
In 1940s, it became clear that unit operations alone were insufficient in
developing chemical_reactors. While the predominance of unit operations in
chemical engineering courses in Britain and the United States continued until
the 1960s, transport_phenomena started to experience greater focus.[17] Along
with other novel concepts, such as process_systems_engineering (PSE), a "second
paradigm" was defined.[18][19] Transport phenomena gave an analytical approach
to chemical engineering[20] while PSE focused on its synthetic elements, such
as control_system and process_design.[21] Developments in chemical engineering
before and after World_War_II were mainly incited by the petrochemical
industry,[22] however, advances in other fields were made as well. Advancements
in biochemical_engineering in the 1940s, for example, found application in the
pharmaceutical_industry, and allowed for the mass_production of various
antibiotics, including penicillin and streptomycin.[23] Meanwhile, progress in
polymer_science in the 1950s paved way for the "age of plastics".[24]
**** Safety and hazard developments[edit] ****
Concerns regarding the safety and environmental impact of large-scale chemical
manufacturing facilities were also raised during this period. Silent_Spring,
published in 1962, alerted its readers to the harmful effects of DDT, a potent
insecticide.[citation_needed] The 1974 Flixborough_disaster in the United
Kingdom resulted in 28 deaths, as well as damage to a chemical_plant and three
nearby villages.[citation_needed] The 1984 Bhopal_disaster in India resulted in
almost 4,000 deaths.[citation_needed] These incidents, along with other
incidents, affected the reputation of the trade as industrial_safety and
environmental_protection were given more focus.[25] In response, the IChemE
required safety to be part of every degree course that it accredited after
1982. By the 1970s, legislation and monitoring agencies were instituted in
various countries, such as France, Germany, and the United States.[26]
**** Recent progress[edit] ****
Advancements in computer_science found applications designing and managing
plants, simplifying calculations and drawings that previously had to be done
manually. The completion of the Human_Genome_Project is also seen as a major
development, not only advancing chemical engineering but genetic_engineering
and genomics as well.[27] Chemical engineering principles were used to produce
DNA_sequences in large quantities.[28]

Chemical engineering involves the application of several principles. Key
concepts are presented below.
**** Plant design and construction[edit] ****
Chemical engineering design concerns the creation of plans, specification, and
economic analyses for pilot_plants, new plants or plant modifications. Design
engineers often work in a consulting role, designing plants to meet clients'
needs. Design is limited by a number of factors, including funding, government
regulations and safety standards. These constraints dictate a plant's choice of
process, materials and equipment.[29]
Plant construction is coordinated by project_engineers and project managers
[30] depending on the size of the investment. A chemical engineer may do the
job of project engineer full-time or part of the time, which requires
additional training and job skills or act as a consultant to the project group.
In the USA the education of chemical engineering graduates from the
Baccalaureate programs accredited by ABET do not usually stress project
engineering education, which can be obtained by specialized training, as
electives, or from graduate_programs. Project engineering jobs are some of the
largest employers for chemical engineers.[31]
**** Process design and analysis[edit] ****
Main article: Process_design
A unit operation is a physical step in an individual chemical engineering
process. Unit operations (such as crystallization, filtration, drying and
evaporation) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its
products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in
reactors.[32] On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a
unit operation. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process
operation. Unit processes (such as nitration and oxidation) involve the
conversion of material by biochemical, thermochemical and other means. Chemical
engineers responsible for these are called process_engineers.[33]
Process design requires the definition of equipment types and sizes as well as
how they are connected together and the materials of construction. Details are
often printed on a Process_Flow_Diagram which is used to control the capacity
and reliability of a new or modified chemical factory.
Education_for_chemical_engineers in the first college degree 3 or 4 years of
study stresses the principles and practices of process design. The same skills
are used in existing chemical plants to evaluate the efficiency and make
recommendations for improvements.
**** Transport phenomena[edit] ****
Main article: Transport_phenomena
Modeling and analysis of transport phenomena is essential for many industrial
applications. Transport phenomena involve fluid_dynamics, heat_transfer and
mass_transfer, which are governed mainly by momentum_transfer, energy_transfer
and transport of chemical_species respectively. Models often involve separate
considerations for macroscopic, microscopic and molecular level phenomena.
Modeling of transport phenomena therefore requires an understanding of applied
mathematics.[34]
***** Applications and practice[edit] *****
[Two_computer_flat_screens_showing_a_plant_process_management_application]
Chemical engineers use computers to control automated systems in plants.[35]
Operators in a chemical plant using an older analog control board, seen in
East-Germany, 1986.
Chemical_engineers "develop economic ways of using materials and energy".[36]
Chemical engineers use chemistry and engineering to turn raw materials into
usable products, such as medicine, petrochemicals and plastics on a large-
scale, industrial setting. They are also involved in waste_management and
research. Both applied and research facets could make extensive use of
computers.[35]
Chemical engineers may be involved in industry or university research where
they are tasked with designing and performing experiments to create better and
safer methods for production, pollution control, and resource conservation.
They may be involved in designing and constructing plants as a project
engineer. Chemical engineers serving as project engineers use their knowledge
in selecting optimal production methods and plant equipment to minimize costs
and maximize safety and profitability. After plant construction, chemical
engineering project managers may be involved in equipment upgrades, process
changes, troubleshooting, and daily operations in either full-time or
consulting roles. [37]
