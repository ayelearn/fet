Polypropylene (PP), also known as polypropene, is a thermoplastic polymer used
in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via chain-growth
polymerization from the monomer propylene.
Polypropylene belongs to the group of polyolefins and is partially_crystalline
and non-polar. Its properties are similar to polyethylene, but it is slightly
harder and more heat resistant. It is a white, mechanically rugged material and
has a high chemical resistance.[1] Polypropylene is the second-most widely
produced commodity_plastic (after polyethylene) and it is often used in
packaging_and_labeling. In 2013, the global market for polypropylene was about
55 million tonnes.[2]

***** History[edit] *****
Phillips_Petroleum chemists J._Paul_Hogan and Robert_Banks first polymerized
propylene in 1951.[3] Propylene was first polymerized to a crystalline
isotactic polymer by Giulio_Natta as well as by the German chemist Karl Rehn in
March 1954.[4] This pioneering discovery led to large-scale commercial
production of isotactic polypropylene by the Italian firm Montecatini from 1957
onwards.[5] Syndiotactic polypropylene was also first synthesized by Natta and
his coworkers.
After polyethylene, polypropylene is the most profitable plastic with revenues
expected to exceed US$145 billion by 2019. The sales of this material are
forecast to grow at a rate of 5.8% per year until 2021.[2]
***** Chemical and physical properties[edit] *****
Micrograph of polypropylene
Polypropylene is in many aspects similar to polyethylene, especially in
solution_behaviour and electrical properties. The methyl_group improves
mechanical properties and thermal resistance, although the chemical resistance
decreases.[6]:19 The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight
and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of
comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity.[6] In isotactic polypropylene, for
example, the methyl groups are oriented on one side of the carbon backbone.
This arrangement creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a
stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic
polypropylene and polyethylene.[7]
**** Mechanical properties[edit] ****
The density of (PP) is between 0.895 and 0.92 g/cmÂ³. Therefore, PP is the
commodity_plastic with the lowest density. With lower density, moldings_parts
with lower weight and more parts of a certain mass of plastic can be produced.
Unlike polyethylene, crystalline and amorphous regions differ only slightly in
their density. However, the density of polyethylene can significantly change
with fillers.[6]:24
The Young's_modulus of PP is between 1300 and 1800 N/mmÂ².
Polypropylene is normally tough and flexible, especially when copolymerized
with ethylene. This allows polypropylene to be used as an engineering_plastic,
competing with materials such as acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene (ABS).
Polypropylene is reasonably economical.[citation_needed]
Polypropylene has good resistance to fatigue.[8]:3070
**** Thermal properties[edit] ****
The melting point of polypropylene occurs in a range, so the melting point is
determined by finding the highest temperature of a differential_scanning
calorimetry chart. Perfectly isotactic PP has a melting point of 171 Â°C
(340 Â°F). Commercial isotactic PP has a melting point that ranges from 160 to
166 Â°C (320 to 331 Â°F), depending on atactic material and crystallinity.
Syndiotactic PP with a crystallinity of 30% has a melting point of 130 Â°C
(266 Â°F).[8] Below 0 Â°C, PP becomes brittle.[9]
The thermal expansion of polypropylene is very large, but somewhat less than
that of polyethylene.[9]
**** Chemical properties[edit] ****
Polypropylene at room temperature is resistant to fats and almost all organic
solvents, apart from strong oxidants. Non-oxidizing_acids and bases can be
stored in containers made of PP. At elevated temperature, PP can be dissolved
in nonpolar solvents such as xylene, tetralin and decalin. Due to the tertiary
carbon atom PP is chemically less resistant than PE (see Markovnikov_rule).[10]
Most commercial polypropylene is isotactic and has an intermediate level of
crystallinity between that of low-density_polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density
polyethylene (HDPE). Isotactic & atactic polypropylene is soluble in P-xylene
at 140 Â°C. Isotactic precipitates when the solution is cooled to 25 Â°C and
atactic portion remains soluble in P-xylene.
The melt flow rate (MFR) or melt_flow_index (MFI) is a measure of molecular
weight of polypropylene. The measure helps to determine how easily the molten
raw material will flow during processing. Polypropylene with higher MFR will
fill the plastic mold more easily during the injection or blow-molding
production process. As the melt flow increases, however, some physical
properties, like impact strength, will decrease.
There are three general types of polypropylene: homopolymer, random copolymer,
and block_copolymer. The comonomer is typically used with ethylene. Ethylene-
propylene rubber or EPDM added to polypropylene homopolymer increases its low
temperature impact strength. Randomly polymerized ethylene monomer added to
polypropylene homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the
melting point and makes the polymer more transparent.
*** Molecular structure â tacticity[edit] ***
[Polypropylene_tacticity_de.svg]
Polypropylene can be categorized as atactic polypropylene (PP-at), syndiotactic
polypropylene (PP-st) and isotactic polypropylene (PP-it). In case of atactic
polypropylene, the methyl group (-CH3) is randomly aligned, alternating
(alternating) for syndiotactic polypropylene and evenly for isotactic
polypropylene. This has an impact on the crystallinity (amorphous or semi-
crystalline) and the thermal properties (expressed as glass_transition_point Tg
and melting_point Tm).
The term tacticity describes for polypropylene how the methyl group is oriented
in the polymer chain. Commercial polypropylene is usually isotactic. This
article therefore always refers to isotactic polypropylene, unless stated
otherwise. The tacticity is usually indicated in percent, using the isotactic
index (according to DIN 16774). The index is measured by determining the
fraction of the polymer insoluble in boiling heptane. Commercially available
polypropylenes usually have an isotactic index between 85 and 95%. The
tacticity effects the polymers physical_properties. As the methyl_group is in
isotactic propylene consistently located at the same side, it forces the
macromolecule in a helical_shape, as also found in starch. An isotactic
structure leads to a semi-crystalline_polymer. The higher the isotacticity (the
isotactic fraction), the greater the crystallinity, and thus also the softening
point, rigidity, e-modulus and hardness.[11]:22
Atactic polypropylene, on the other hand, lacks any regularity which makes it
unable to crystallize and amorphous.
*** Crystal structure of polypropylene[edit] ***
Isotactic polypropylene has a high degree_of_crystallinity, in industrial
products 30â60%. Syndiothactic polypropylene is slightly less crystalline,
atactic PP is amorphous (not crystalline).[12]:251
** Isotactic polypropylene (iPP)[edit] **
Isotactic polypropylene can exist in various crystalline modifications which
differ by the molecular arrangement of the polymer chains. The crystalline
modifications are categorized into the Î±-, Î²- and Î³-modification as well as
mesomorphic (smectic) forms.[13] The Î±-modification is predominant in iPP.
Such crystals are built from lamellae in the form of folded chains. A
characteristic anomaly is that the lamellae are arranged in the so-called
"cross-hatched" structure.[14] The melting point of Î±-crystalline regions is
given as 185[15][16] to 220 Â°C,[15][17] the density as 0.936 to 0.946
gÂ·cmâ3.[18][19] The Î²-modification is in comparison somewhat less ordered,
as a result of which it forms faster[20][21] and has a lower melting point of
170 to 200 Â°C.[15][22][23][17] The formation of the Î²-modification can be
promoted by nucleating agents, suitable temperatures and shear stress.[20][24]
The Î³-modification is hardly formed under the conditions used in industry and
is poorly understood. The mesomorphic modification, however, occurs often in
industrial processing, since the plastic is usually cooled quickly. The degree
of order of the mesomorphic phase ranges between the crystalline and the
amorphous phase, its density is with 0.916 gÂ·cmâ3 comparatively. The
mesomorphic phase is considered as cause for the transparency in rapidly cooled
films (due to low order and small crystallites).[12]
** Syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP)[edit] **
Syndiotactic polypropylene was discovered much later than isotactic PP and
could only be prepared by using metallocene_catalysts. Syndiotactic PP has a
lower melting point, with 161 to 186 Â°C, depending on the degree of tacticity.
[25][26][27]
** Atactic polypropylene (aPP)[edit] **
Atactic polypropylene is amorphous and has therefore no crystal structure. Due
to its lack of crystallinity, it is readily soluble even at moderate
temperatures, which allows to separate it as by-product from isotactic
polypropylene by extraction. However, the aPP obtained this way is not
completely amorphous but can still contain 15% crystalline parts. Atactic
polypropylene can also be produced selectively using metallocene catalysts,
atactic polypropylene produced this way has a considerably higher molecular
weight.[12]
Atactic polypropylene has lower density, melting point and softening
temperature than the crystalline types and is tacky and rubber-like at room
temperature. It is a colorless, cloudy material and can be used between â15
and +120 Â°C. Atactic polypropylene is used as a sealant, as an insulating
material for automobiles and as an additive to bitumen.[28]
*** Degradation[edit] ***
Effect of UV exposure on polypropylene rope
Polypropylene is liable to chain degradation from exposure to temperatures
above 100 Â°C. Oxidation usually occurs at the tertiary_carbon centers leading
to chain breaking via reaction with oxygen. In external applications,
degradation is evidenced by cracks and crazing. It may be protected by the use
of various polymer_stabilizers, including UV-absorbing additives and anti-
oxidants such as phosphites (e.g. tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite) and
hindered phenols, which prevent polymer_degradation.[1]
Microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch have been
shown to be capable of degrading polypropylene.[29] Polypropylene has been
reported to degrade while in human body as implantable mesh devices. The
degraded material forms a tree bark-like layer at the surface of mesh fibers.
[30]
**** Optical properties[edit] ****
PP can be made translucent when uncolored but is not as readily made
transparent as polystyrene, acrylic, or certain other plastics. It is often
opaque or colored using pigments.
***** Production[edit] *****
Polypropylene is produced by the chain-growth_polymerization of propene:
[PolypropylÃ¨ne.png]
The industrial production processes can be grouped into gas phase
polymerization, bulk_polymerization and slurry polymerization. All state-of-
the-art processes use either gas-phase or bulk reactor systems.[31]
    * In gas-phase and slurry-reactors, the polymer is formed around
      heterogeneous catalyst particles. The gas-phase polymerization is carried
      out in a fluidized_bed_reactor, propene is passed over a bed containing
      the heterogeneous_(solid)_catalyst and the formed polymer is separated as
      a fine powder and then converted into pellets. Unreacted gas is recycled
      and fed back into the reactor.
    * In bulk polymerization, liquid propene acts as a solvent to prevent the
      precipitation of the polymer. The polymerization proceeds at 60 to 80 Â°C
      and 30â40 atm are applied to keep the propene in the liquid state. For
      the bulk polymerization, typically loop_reactors are applied. The bulk
      polymerization is limited to a maximum of 5% ethen as comonomer due to a
      limited solubility of the polymer in the liquid propene.
    * In the slurry polymerization, typically C4âC6 alkanes (butane, pentane
      or hexane) are utilized as inert diluent to suspend the growing polymer
      particles. Propene is introduced into the mixture as a gas.
The properties of PP are strongly affected by its tacticity, the orientation of
the methyl_groups (CH
3) relative to the methyl groups in neighboring monomer units (see above). The
tacticity of polypropylene can be chosen by the choice of an appropriate
catalyst.
**** Catalysts[edit] ****
The properties of PP are strongly affected by its tacticity, the orientation of
the methyl_groups (CH
3 in the figure) relative to the methyl groups in neighboring monomer units. A
ZieglerâNatta_catalyst is able to restrict linking of monomer molecules to a
specific orientation, either isotactic, when all methyl groups are positioned
at the same side with respect to the backbone of the polymer chain, or
syndiotactic, when the positions of the methyl groups alternate. Commercially
available isotactic polypropylene is made with two types of Ziegler-Natta
catalysts. The first group of the catalysts encompasses solid (mostly
supported) catalysts and certain types of soluble metallocene catalysts. Such
isotactic macromolecules coil into a helical shape; these helices then line up
next to one another to form the crystals that give commercial isotactic
polypropylene many of its desirable properties.
A ball-and-stick model of syndiotactic polypropylene.
Another type of metallocene catalysts produce syndiotactic polypropylene.[25]
These macromolecules also coil into helices (of a different type) and
crystallize. Atactic polypropylene is an amorphous rubbery material. It can be
produced commercially either with a special type of supported Ziegler-Natta
catalyst or with some metallocene catalysts.
Modern supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts developed for the polymerization of
propylene and other 1-alkenes to isotactic polymers usually use TiCl
4 as an active ingredient and MgCl
2 as a support.[32][33][34] The catalysts also contain organic modifiers,
either aromatic acid esters and diesters or ethers. These catalysts are
activated with special cocatalysts containing an organoaluminum compound such
as Al(C2H5)3 and the second type of a modifier. The catalysts are
differentiated depending on the procedure used for fashioning catalyst
particles from MgCl2 and depending on the type of organic modifiers employed
during catalyst preparation and use in polymerization reactions. Two most
important technological characteristics of all the supported catalysts are high
productivity and a high fraction of the crystalline isotactic polymer they
produce at 70â80 Â°C under standard polymerization conditions. Commercial
synthesis of isotactic polypropylene is usually carried out either in the
medium of liquid propylene or in gas-phase reactors.
Commercial synthesis of syndiotactic polypropylene is carried out with the use
of a special class of metallocene catalysts. They employ bridged bis-
metallocene complexes of the type bridge-(Cp1)(Cp2)ZrCl2 where the first Cp
ligand is the cyclopentadienyl group, the second Cp ligand is the fluorenyl
group, and the bridge between the two Cp ligands is -CH2-CH2-, >SiMe2, or
>SiPh2.[35] These complexes are converted to polymerization catalysts by
activating them with a special organoaluminum cocatalyst, methylaluminoxane
(MAO).[36]
***** Industrial processes[edit] *****
Traditionally, three manufacturing processes are the most representative ways
to produce polypropylene.[37]
Hydrocarbon slurry or suspension: Uses a liquid inert hydrocarbon diluent in
the reactor to facilitate transfer of propylene to the catalyst, the removal of
heat from the system, the deactivation/removal of the catalyst as well as
dissolving the atactic polymer. The range of grades that could be produced was
very limited. (The technology has fallen into disuse).
Bulk slurry (or bulk): Uses liquid propylene instead of liquid inert
hydrocarbon diluent. The polymer does not dissolve into a diluent, but rather
rides on the liquid propylene. The formed polymer is withdrawn and any
unreacted monomer is flashed off.
Gas phase: Uses gaseous propylene in contact with the solid catalyst, resulting
in a fluidized-bed medium.
***** Manufacturing from polypropylene[edit] *****
Melting process of polypropylene can be achieved via extrusion and molding.
Common extrusion methods include production of melt-blown and spun-bond fibers
to form long rolls for future conversion into a wide range of useful products,
such as face masks, filters, diapers and wipes.
The most common shaping technique is injection_molding, which is used for parts
such as cups, cutlery, vials, caps, containers, housewares, and automotive
parts such as batteries. The related techniques of blow_molding and injection-
stretch_blow_molding are also used, which involve both extrusion and molding.
The large number of end-use applications for polypropylene are often possible
because of the ability to tailor grades with specific molecular properties and
additives during its manufacture. For example, antistatic additives can be
added to help polypropylene surfaces resist dust and dirt. Many physical
finishing techniques can also be used on polypropylene, such as machining.
Surface_treatments can be applied to polypropylene parts in order to promote
adhesion of printing ink and paints.
Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) has been produced through both solid and melt
state processing. EPP is manufactured using melt processing with either
chemical or physical blowing agents. Expansion of PP in solid state, due to its
highly crystalline structure, has not been successful. In this regard, two
novel strategies were developed for expansion of PP. It was observed that PP
can be expanded to make EPP through controlling its crystalline structure or
through blending with other polymers.[38][39]
**** Biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP)[edit] ****
When polypropylene film is extruded and stretched in both the machine direction
and across machine direction it is called biaxially oriented polypropylene.
Biaxial orientation increases strength and clarity.[40] BOPP is widely used as
a packaging material for packaging products such as snack foods, fresh produce
and confectionery. It is easy to coat, print and laminate to give the required
appearance and properties for use as a packaging material. This process is
normally called converting. It is normally produced in large rolls which are
slit on slitting_machines into smaller rolls for use on packaging machines.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Polypropylene lid of a Tic_Tac box, with a living_hinge and the resin
identification_code under its flap
As polypropylene is resistant to fatigue, most plastic living_hinges, such as
those on flip-top bottles, are made from this material. However, it is
important to ensure that chain molecules are oriented across the hinge to
maximise strength.
Polypropylene is used in the manufacturing of piping systems, both ones
concerned with high purity and ones designed for strength and rigidity (e.g.,
those intended for use in potable plumbing, hydronic_heating and cooling, and
reclaimed_water).[41] This material is often chosen for its resistance to
corrosion and chemical leaching, its resilience against most forms of physical
damage, including impact and freezing, its environmental benefits, and its
ability to be joined by heat_fusion rather than gluing.[42][43][44]
A polypropylene chair
Many plastic items for medical or laboratory use can be made from polypropylene
because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also
enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles
[citation_needed]. Food containers made from it will not melt in the
dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this
reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with
aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled,
the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as
LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the
difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of
LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent.
Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic_containers made in a wide variety of
shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and
Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made
of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap onto the container to close it.
Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid,
powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene
terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car
batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers,
dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which
commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient
temperature. A diversity of medical devices are made from PP.[45]
Polypropylene items for laboratory use, blue and orange closures are not made
of polypropylene.
A common application for polypropylene is as biaxially oriented polypropylene
(BOPP). These BOPP sheets are used to make a wide variety of materials
including clear bags. When polypropylene is biaxially oriented, it becomes
crystal clear and serves as an excellent packaging material for artistic and
retail products.
Polypropylene, highly colorfast, is widely used in manufacturing carpets, rugs
and mats to be used at home.[46]
Polypropylene is widely used in ropes, distinctive because they are light
enough to float in water.[47] For equal mass and construction, polypropylene
rope is similar in strength to polyester rope. Polypropylene costs less than
most other synthetic fibers.
Polypropylene is also used as an alternative to polyvinyl_chloride (PVC) as
insulation for electrical cables for LSZH cable in low-ventilation
environments, primarily tunnels. This is because it emits less smoke and no
toxic halogens, which may lead to production of acid in high-temperature
conditions.
Polypropylene is also used in particular roofing membranes as the waterproofing
top layer of single-ply systems as opposed to modified-bit systems.
Polypropylene is most commonly used for plastic moldings, wherein it is
injected into a mold while molten, forming complex shapes at relatively low
cost and high volume; examples include bottle tops, bottles, and fittings.
It can also be produced in sheet form, widely used for the production of
stationery folders, packaging, and storage boxes. The wide color range,
durability, low cost, and resistance to dirt make it ideal as a protective
cover for papers and other materials. It is used in Rubik's_Cube stickers
because of these characteristics.
The availability of sheet polypropylene has provided an opportunity for the use
of the material by designers. The light-weight, durable, and colorful plastic
makes an ideal medium for the creation of light shades, and a number of designs
have been developed using interlocking sections to create elaborate designs.
Polypropylene sheets are a popular choice for trading_card collectors; these
come with pockets (nine for standard-size cards) for the cards to be inserted
and are used to protect their condition and are meant to be stored in a binder.
Expanded polypropylene (EPP) is a foam form of polypropylene. EPP has very good
impact characteristics due to its low stiffness; this allows EPP to resume its
shape after impacts. EPP is extensively used in model aircraft and other radio
controlled vehicles by hobbyists. This is mainly due to its ability to absorb
impacts, making this an ideal material for RC aircraft for beginners and
amateurs.
Polypropylene is used in the manufacture of loudspeaker drive units. Its use
was pioneered by engineers at the BBC and the patent rights subsequently
purchased by Mission_Electronics for use in their Mission_Freedom_Loudspeaker
and Mission_737_Renaissance loudspeaker.
Polypropylene fibres are used as a concrete additive to increase strength and
reduce cracking and spalling.[48] In some areas susceptible to earthquakes
(e.g., California), PP fibers are added with soils to improve the soil's
strength and damping when constructing the foundation of structures such as
buildings, bridges, etc.[49]
Polypropylene fibres are also used in drywall joint compound for reinforcement.
It can increases the flexibility and dimensional stability of the joint
compound and reduce shrinkage and cracking when it drys.
Polypropylene is used in polypropylene_drums.
In June 2016, a study showed that a mixture of polypropylene and durable
superoleophobic surfaces created by two engineers from Ohio_State_University
can repel liquids such as shampoo and oil. This technology could make it easier
to remove all of the liquid contents from polypropylene bottles, particularly
those that have high surface tension such as shampoo or oil.[50]
**** Clothing[edit] ****
Various polypropylene yarns and textiles
Polypropylene is a major polymer used in nonwovens, with over 50% used[citation
needed] for diapers or sanitary products where it is treated to absorb water
(hydrophilic) rather than naturally repelling water (hydrophobic). Other
interesting non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which
the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form
cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30
micrometre range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-
conditioning-type filters. The high surface-area and naturally oleophilic
polypropylene nonwovens are ideal absorbers of oil spills with the familiar
[citation_needed] floating barriers near oil spills on rivers.
Polypropylene, or 'polypro', has been used for the fabrication of cold-weather
base layers, such as long-sleeve shirts or long underwear. Polypropylene is
also used in warm-weather clothing, in which it transports sweat away from the
skin. Polyester has replaced polypropylene in these applications in the U.S.
military, such as in the ECWCS.[51] Although polypropylene clothes are not
easily flammable, they can melt, which may result in severe burns if the wearer
is involved in an explosion or fire of any kind.[52] Polypropylene
undergarments are known for retaining body odors which are then difficult to
remove. The current generation of polyester does not have this disadvantage.
[53]
Some fashion_designers have adapted polypropylene to construct jewelry and
other wearable_items.[citation_needed]
**** Medical[edit] ****
Its most common medical use is in the synthetic, nonabsorbable suture Prolene,
manufactured by Ethicon_Inc.
Polypropylene has been used in hernia and pelvic organ prolapse repair
operations to protect the body from new hernias in the same location. A small
patch of the material is placed over the spot of the hernia, below the skin,
and is painless and rarely, if ever, rejected by the body. However, a
polypropylene mesh will erode the tissue surrounding it over the uncertain
period from days to years.
A notable application was as a transvaginal mesh, used to treat vaginal
prolapse and concurrent urinary incontinence.[54] Due to the above-mentioned
propensity for polypropylene mesh to erode the tissue surrounding it, the FDA
has issued several warnings on the use of polypropylene mesh medical kits for
certain applications in pelvic organ prolapse, specifically when introduced in
close proximity to the vaginal wall due to a continued increase in number of
mesh-driven tissue erosions reported by patients over the past few years.[55]
On 3 January 2012, the FDA ordered 35 manufacturers of these mesh products to
study the side effects of these devices.

**** Niche[edit] ****
Very thin sheets (â2â20 Âµm) of polypropylene are used as a dielectric
within certain high-performance pulse and low-loss RF capacitors.
Expanded polypropylene (EPP) foams is a structural material in hobbyist radio
control model_aircraft. Unlike expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) which is friable
and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam is able to absorb kinetic impacts very
well without breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form
characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in a short
amount of time.[57]
When the cathedral on Tenerife, La_Laguna_Cathedral, was repaired in
2002â2014, it turned out that the vaults and dome were in a rather bad
condition. Therefore, these parts of the building were demolished, and replaced
by constructions in polypropylene. This was reported as the first time this
material was used in this scale in buildings.[citation_needed]
Under the trade name Ulstron polypropylene rope is used to manufacture scoop
nets for whitebait. It has also been used for sheets of yacht sails.[58][59]
Polymer_banknotes are made from BOPP, where it provides a durable base and
allows for the use of transparent security features by omitting opaque inks in
the desired areas.
***** Recycling[edit] *****
Polypropylene is recyclable and has the number "5" as its resin_identification
code:[60] [Symbol_Resin_Code_5_PP.svg]
***** Repairing[edit] *****
Many objects are made with polypropylene precisely because it is resilient and
resistant to most solvents and glues. Also, there are very few glues available
specifically for gluing PP. However, solid PP objects not subject to undue
flexing can be satisfactorily joined with a two-part_epoxy glue or using hot-
glue guns. Preparation is important and it is often helpful to roughen the
surface with a file, emery paper or other abrasive material to provide better
anchorage for the glue. Also it is recommended to clean with mineral spirits or
similar alcohol prior to gluing to remove any oils or other contamination. Some
experimentation may be required. There are also some industrial glues available
for PP, but these can be difficult to find, especially in a retail store.[61]
PP can be melted using a speed welding technique. With speed welding, the
plastic welder, similar to a soldering iron in appearance and wattage, is
fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod
and the substrate, while at the same time it presses the molten weld rod into
position. A bead of softened plastic is laid into the joint, and the parts and
weld rod fuse. With polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be "mixed" with
the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired. A speed tip "gun"
is essentially a soldering iron with a broad, flat tip that can be used to melt
the weld joint and filler material to create a bond.
***** Health concerns[edit] *****
The advocacy organization Environmental_Working_Group classifies PP as of low
to moderate hazard.[62][why?] PP is dope-dyed; no water is used in its dyeing,
in contrast with cotton.[63]
***** Combustiblity[edit] *****
Like all organic compounds, polypropylene is combustible.[64] The flash_point
of a typical composition is 260 Â°C; autoignition_temperature is 388 Â°C.[65]
