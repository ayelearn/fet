An oil is any nonpolar chemical_substance that is a viscous liquid at ambient
temperatures and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally "water
fearing") and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally "fat loving"). Oils
have a high carbon and hydrogen content and are usually flammable and surface
active.
The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may
be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses. Oils may be animal,
vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile.[1]
They are used for food (e.g., olive_oil), fuel (e.g., heating_oil), medical
purposes (e.g., mineral_oil), lubrication (e.g. motor_oil), and the manufacture
of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials. Specially prepared oils
are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.

***** Etymology *****
First attested in English 1176, the word oil comes from Old_French oile, from
Latin oleum,[2] which in turn comes from the Greek á¼Î»Î±Î¹Î¿Î½ (elaion),
"olive oil, oil"[3] and that from á¼Î»Î±Î¯Î± (elaia), "olive tree", "olive
fruit".[4][5] The earliest attested forms of the word are the Mycenaean_Greek
ðð¨ðº, e-ra-wo and ðððº, e-rai-wo, written in the Linear_B
syllabic script.[6]
***** Types *****
**** Organic oils ****
Organic oils are produced in remarkable diversity by plants, animals, and other
organisms through natural metabolic processes. Lipid is the scientific term for
the fatty_acids, steroids and similar chemicals often found in the oils
produced by living things, while oil refers to an overall mixture of chemicals.
Organic oils may also contain chemicals other than lipids, including proteins,
waxes (class of compounds with oil-like properties that are solid at common
temperatures) and alkaloids.
Lipids can be classified by the way that they are made by an organism, their
chemical structure and their limited solubility in water compared to oils. They
have a high carbon and hydrogen content and are considerably lacking in oxygen
compared to other organic compounds and minerals; they tend to be relatively
nonpolar molecules, but may include both polar and nonpolar regions as in the
case of phospholipids and steroids.[7]
**** Mineral oils ****
Crude oil, or petroleum, and its refined components, collectively termed
petrochemicals, are crucial resources in the modern economy. Crude oil
originates from ancient fossilized organic_materials, such as zooplankton and
algae, which geochemical processes convert into oil.[8] The name "mineral oil"
is a misnomer, in that minerals are not the source of the oilâancient plants
and animals are. Mineral oil is organic. However, it is classified as "mineral
oil" instead of as "organic oil" because its organic origin is remote (and was
unknown at the time of its discovery), and because it is obtained in the
vicinity of rocks, underground traps, and sands. Mineral_oil also refers to
several specific distillates of crude oil.
***** Applications *****
**** Cooking ****
Main article: Cooking_oil
Several edible vegetable and animal oils, and also fats, are used for various
purposes in cooking and food preparation. In particular, many foods are fried
in oil much hotter than boiling water. Oils are also used for flavoring and for
modifying the texture of foods (e.g. Stir_Fry). Cooking oils are derived either
from animal fat, as butter, lard and other types, or plant oils from the olive,
maize, sunflower and many other species.
**** Cosmetics ****
Oils are applied to hair to give it a lustrous look, to prevent tangles and
roughness and to stabilize the hair to promote growth. See hair_conditioner.
**** Religion ****
Oil has been used throughout history as a religious medium. It is often
considered a spiritually purifying agent and is used for anointing purposes. As
a particular example, holy_anointing_oil has been an important ritual liquid
for Judaism and Christianity.
**** Painting ****
Main article: Oil_painting
Color pigments are easily suspended in oil, making it suitable as a supporting
medium for paints. The oldest known extant oil paintings date from 650 AD.[9]
**** Heat transfer ****
See also: Transformer_oil
Oils are used as coolants in oil_cooling, for instance in electric
transformers. Heat transfer oils are used both as coolants (see oil_cooling),
for heating (e.g. in oil_heaters) and in other applications of heat transfer.
**** Lubrication ****
Synthetic motor oil
Given that they are non-polar, oils do not easily adhere to other substances.
This makes them useful as lubricants for various engineering purposes. Mineral
oils are more commonly used as machine lubricants than biological oils are.
Whale_oil is preferred for lubricating clocks, because it does not evaporate,
leaving dust, although its use was banned in the USA in 1980.[10]
It is a long-running myth that spermaceti from whales has still been used in
NASA projects such as the Hubble_Telescope and the Voyager probe because of its
extremely low freezing temperature. Spermaceti is not actually an oil, but a
mixture mostly of wax esters, and there is no evidence that NASA has used whale
oil.[11]
**** Fuel ****
Main article: Fuel_oil
Some oils burn in liquid or aerosol form, generating light, and heat which can
be used directly or converted into other forms of energy such as electricity or
mechanical work. In order to obtain many fuel oils, crude_oil is pumped from
the ground and is shipped via oil_tanker or a pipeline to an oil_refinery.
There, it is converted from crude oil to diesel_fuel (petrodiesel), ethane (and
other short-chain alkanes), fuel_oils (heaviest of commercial fuels, used in
ships/furnaces), gasoline (petrol), jet_fuel, kerosene, benzene (historically),
and liquefied_petroleum_gas. A 42-US-gallon (35 imp gal; 160 L) barrel of crude
oil produces approximately 10 US gallons (8.3 imp gal; 38 L) of diesel, 4 US
gallons (3.3 imp gal; 15 L) of jet fuel, 19 US gallons (16 imp gal; 72 L) of
gasoline, 7 US gallons (5.8 imp gal; 26 L) of other products, 3 US gallons
(2.5 imp gal; 11 L) split between heavy fuel oil and liquified petroleum gases,
[12] and 2 US gallons (1.7 imp gal; 7.6 L) of heating oil. The total production
of a barrel of crude into various products results in an increase to 45 US
gallons (37 imp gal; 170 L).[12] Not all oils used as fuels are mineral oils,
see biodiesel, vegetable_oil_fuel, and olive_oil.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, whale_oil was commonly used for lamps, which
was replaced with natural gas and then electricity.[13]

Crude oil can be refined into a wide variety of component hydrocarbons.
Petrochemicals are the refined components_of_crude_oil[14] and the chemical
products made from them. They are used as detergents, fertilizers, medicines,
paints, plastics, synthetic_fibers, and synthetic_rubber.
Organic oils are another important chemical feedstock, especially in green
chemistry.
