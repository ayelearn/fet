Solvent extraction.
[1]Liquidâliquid extraction (LLE), also known as solvent extraction and
partitioning, is a method to separate compounds or metal complexes, based on
their relative solubilities in two different immiscible liquids, usually water
(polar) and an organic solvent (non-polar). There is a net transfer of one or
more species from one liquid into another liquid phase, generally from aqueous
to organic. The transfer is driven by chemical potential, i.e. once the
transfer is complete, the overall system of protons and electrons that make up
the solutes and the solvents are in a more stable configuration (lower free
energy). The solvent that is enriched in solute(s) is called extract. The feed
solution that is depleted in solute(s) is called the raffinate. LLE is a basic
technique in chemical laboratories, where it is performed using a variety of
apparatus, from separatory_funnels to countercurrent_distribution equipment
called as mixer settlers.[not_verified_in_body] This type of process is
commonly performed after a chemical reaction as part of the work-up, often
including an acidic work-up.
The term partitioning is commonly used to refer to the underlying chemical and
physical processes involved in liquidâliquid extraction, but on another
reading may be fully synonymous with it. The term solvent extraction can also
refer to the separation of a substance from a mixture by preferentially
dissolving that substance in a suitable solvent. In that case, a soluble
compound is separated from an insoluble compound or a complex matrix.[not
verified_in_body]
From a hydrometallurgical perspective, solvent extraction is exclusively used
in separation and purification of uranium and plutonium, zirconium and hafnium,
separation of cobalt and nickel, separation and purification of rare earth
elements etc., its greatest advantage being its ability to selectively separate
out even very similar metals. One obtains high-purity single metal streams on
'stripping' out the metal value from the 'loaded' organic wherein one can
precipitate or deposit the metal value. Stripping is the opposite of
extraction: Transfer of mass from organic to aqueous phase.
LLE is also widely used in the production of fine organic_compounds, the
processing of perfumes, the production of vegetable_oils and biodiesel, and
other industries.[not_verified_in_body] It is among the most common initial
separation techniques, though some difficulties result in extracting out
closely related functional groups.
Liquidâliquid extraction is possible in non-aqueous systems: In a system
consisting of a molten metal in contact with molten_salts, metals can be
extracted from one phase to the other. This is related to a mercury electrode
where a metal can be reduced, the metal will often then dissolve in the mercury
to form an amalgam that modifies its electrochemistry greatly. For example, it
is possible for sodium cations to be reduced at a mercury cathode to form
sodium_amalgam, while at an inert electrode (such as platinum) the sodium
cations are not reduced. Instead, water is reduced to hydrogen. A detergent or
fine solid can be used to stabilize an emulsion, or third_phase.[not_verified

**** Distribution ratio[edit] ****

In solvent extraction, a distribution ratio is often quoted as a measure of how
well-extracted a species is. The distribution ratio (Kd) is equal to the
concentration of a solute in the organic phase divided by its concentration in
the aqueous_phase. Depending on the system, the distribution ratio can be a
function of temperature, the concentration of chemical species in the system,
and a large number of other parameters. Note that D is related to the ÎG of
the extraction process.
Sometimes, the distribution ratio is referred to as the partition_coefficient,
which is often expressed as the logarithm. Note that a distribution ratio for
uranium and neptunium between two inorganic solids (zirconolite and perovskite)
has been reported.[2] In solvent extraction, two immiscible liquids are shaken
together. The more polar solutes dissolve preferentially in the more polar
solvent, and the less polar solutes in the less polar solvent. In this
experiment, the nonpolar halogens preferentially dissolve in the non-polar
mineral oil.[3]
Although the distribution ratio and partition coefficient are often used
synonymously, they are not necessarily so. Solutes may exist in more than one
form in any particular phase, which would mean that the partition coefficient
(Kd) and distribution ratio (D) will have different values. This is an
important distinction to make as whilst the partition coefficient has a fixed
value for the partitioning of a solute between two phases, the distribution
ratio changes with differing conditions in the solvent.[4]
After performing liquidâliquid extraction, a quantitative measure must be
taken to determine the ratio of the solutionâs total concentration in each
phase of the extraction. This quantitative measure is known as the distribution
ratio or distribution coefficient.[5]
**** Separation factors[edit] ****
The separation factor is one distribution ratio divided by another; it is a
measure of the ability of the system to separate two solutes. For instance, if
the distribution ratio for nickel (DNi) is 10 and the distribution ratio for
silver (DAg) is 100, then the silver/nickel separation factor (SFAg/Ni) is
equal to DAg/DNi = SFAg/Ni = 10.[6]
**** Decontamination factor[edit] ****
This is used to express the ability of a process to remove a contaminant from a
product. For instance, if a process is fed with a mixture of 1:9 cadmium to
indium, and the product is a 1:99 mixture of cadmium and indium, then the
decontamination factor (for the removal of cadmium) of the process is 0.11 /
0.01 = 11.
**** Slopes of graphs[edit] ****
The easy way to work out the extraction mechanism is to draw graphs and measure
the slopes. If for an extraction system the D value is proportional to the
square of the concentration of a reagent (Z) then the slope of the graph of
log10(D) against log10([[Z]]) will be two.
**** Measures of success[edit] ****
Success of liquidâliquid extraction is measured through separation factors
and decontamination factors. The best way to understand the success of an
extraction column is through the liquidâliquid equilibrium (LLE) data set.
The data set can then be converted into a curve to determine the steady state
partitioning behavior of the solute between the two phases. The y-axis is the
concentration of solute in the extract (solvent) phase, and the x-axis is the
concentration of the solute in the raffinate phase. From here, one can
determine steps for optimization of the process.[7]

**** Batchwise single stage extractions[edit] ****
This is commonly used on the small scale in chemical labs. It is normal to use
a separating_funnel. Processes include DLLME and direct organic extraction.
After equilibration, the extract phase containing the desired solute is
separated out for further processing.
*** Dispersive liquidâliquid microextraction (DLLME)[edit] ***
A process used to extract small amounts of organic compounds from water
samples.[8] This process is done by injecting small amounts of an appropriate
extraction solvent (C2Cl4) and a disperser solvent (acetone) into the aqueous
solution. The resulting solution is then centrifuged to separate the organic
and aqueous layers. This process is useful in extraction organic compounds such
as organochloride and organophsophorus pesticides, as well as substituted
benzene compounds from water samples.[8]
*** Direct organic extraction[edit] ***
By mixing partially organic soluble samples in organic solvent (toluene,
benzene, xylene), the organic soluble compounds will dissolve into the solvent
and can be separated using a separatory_funnel. This process is valuable in the
extraction of proteins and specifically phosphoprotein and phosphopeptide
phosphatases.[9]
Another example of this application is extracting anisole from a mixture of
water and 5% acetic_acid using ether, then the anisole will enter the organic
phase. The two phases would then be separated. The acetic acid can then be
scrubbed (removed) from the organic phase by shaking the organic extract with
sodium_bicarbonate. The acetic acid reacts with the sodium bicarbonate to form
sodium_acetate, carbon_dioxide, and water.
Caffeine can also be extracted from coffee beans and tea leaves using a direct
organic extraction. The beans or leaves can be soaked in ethyl acetate which
favorably dissolves the caffeine, leaving a majority of the coffee or tea
flavor remaining in the initial sample.[10]
**** Multistage countercurrent continuous processes[edit] ****
Coflore continuous countercurrent extractor.
These are commonly used in industry for the processing of metals such as the
lanthanides; because the separation factors between the lanthanides are so
small many extraction stages are needed.[11] In the multistage processes, the
aqueous raffinate from one extraction unit is fed to the next unit as the
aqueous feed, while the organic phase is moved in the opposite direction.
Hence, in this way, even if the separation between two metals in each stage is
small, the overall system can have a higher decontamination factor.
Multistage countercurrent arrays have been used for the separation of
lanthanides. For the design of a good process, the distribution ratio should be
not too high (>100) or too low (<0.1) in the extraction portion of the process.
It is often the case that the process will have a section for scrubbing
unwanted metals from the organic phase, and finally a stripping section to
obtain the metal back from the organic phase.
*** Mixerâsettlers[edit] ***
Battery of mixer-settlers counter currently interconnected. Each mixer-settler
unit provides a single stage of extraction. A mixer settler consists of a first
stage that mixes the phases together followed by a quiescent settling stage
that allows the phases to separate by gravity.
In the multistage countercurrent process, multiple mixer settlers are installed
with mixing and settling chambers located at alternating ends for each stage
(since the outlet of the settling sections feed the inlets of the adjacent
stageâs mixing sections). Mixer-settlers are used when a process requires
longer residence times and when the solutions are easily separated by gravity.
They require a large facility footprint, but do not require much headspace, and
need limited remote maintenance capability for occasional replacement of mixing
motors. (Colven, 1956; Davidson, 1957)[12]

*** Centrifugal extractors[edit] ***
Centrifugal_extractors mix and separate in one unit. Two liquids will be
intensively mixed between the spinning rotor and the stationary housing at
speeds up to 6000 RPM. This develops great surfaces for an ideal mass transfer
from the aqueous phase into the organic phase. At 200â2000 g, both phases
will be separated again. Centrifugal extractors minimize the solvent in the
process, optimize the product load in the solvent and extract the aqueous phase
completely. Counter current and cross current extractions are easily
established.[13]
**** Extraction without chemical change[edit] ****
Some solutes such as noble_gases can be extracted from one phase to another
without the need for a chemical reaction (see absorption). This is the simplest
type of solvent extraction. When a solvent is extracted, two immiscible liquids
are shaken together. The more polar solutes dissolve preferentially in the more
polar solvent, and the less polar solutes in the less polar solvent. Some
solutes that do not at first sight appear to undergo a reaction during the
extraction process do not have distribution ratio that is independent of
concentration. A classic example is the extraction of carboxylic_acids (HA)
into nonpolar media such as benzene. Here, it is often the case that the
carboxylic acid will form a dimer in the organic layer so the distribution
ratio will change as a function of the acid concentration (measured in either
phase).
For this case, the extraction constant k is described by k = [[HAorganic]]2/[
[HAaqueous]]
**** Solvation mechanism[edit] ****

Using solvent extraction it is possible to extract uranium, plutonium, thorium
and many rare earth elements from acid solutions in a selective way by using
the right choice of organic extracting solvent and diluent. One solvent used
for this purpose is the organophosphate tributyl_phosphate (TBP). The PUREX
process that is commonly used in nuclear_reprocessing uses a mixture of tri-n-
butyl phosphate and an inert hydrocarbon (kerosene), the uranium(VI) are
extracted from strong nitric_acid and are back-extracted (stripped) using weak
nitric acid. An organic soluble uranium complex [UO2(TBP)2(NO3)2] is formed,
then the organic layer bearing the uranium is brought into contact with a
dilute nitric acid solution; the equilibrium is shifted away from the organic
soluble uranium complex and towards the free TBP and uranyl_nitrate in dilute
nitric acid. The plutonium(IV) forms a similar complex to the uranium(VI), but
it is possible to strip the plutonium in more than one way; a reducing_agent
that converts the plutonium to the trivalent oxidation_state can be added. This
oxidation state does not form a stable complex with TBP and nitrate unless the
nitrate concentration is very high (circa 10 mol/L nitrate is required in the
aqueous phase). Another method is to simply use dilute nitric acid as a
stripping agent for the plutonium. This PUREX chemistry is a classic example of
a solvation extraction.
Here in this case DU = k TBP2[[NO3]]2
**** Ion exchange mechanism[edit] ****
Another extraction mechanism is known as the ion_exchange mechanism. Here, when
an ion is transferred from the aqueous phase to the organic phase, another ion
is transferred in the other direction to maintain the charge balance. This
additional ion is often a hydrogen_ion; for ion exchange mechanisms, the
distribution ratio is often a function of pH. An example of an ion exchange
extraction would be the extraction of americium by a combination of terpyridine
and a carboxylic_acid in tert-butyl benzene. In this case
DAm = k terpyridine1carboxylic_acid3H+â3
Another example is the extraction of zinc, cadmium, or lead by a dialkyl
phosphinic acid (R2PO2H) into a nonpolar diluent such as an alkane. A non-polar
diluent favours the formation of uncharged non-polar metal complexes.
Some extraction systems are able to extract metals by both the solvation and
ion exchange mechanisms; an example of such a system is the americium (and
lanthanide) extraction from nitric_acid by a combination of 6,6'-bis-(5,6-
dipentyl-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)-2,2'-bipyridine and 2-bromohexanoic_acid in tert-
butyl benzene. At both high- and low-nitric acid concentrations, the metal
distribution ratio is higher than it is for an intermediate nitric acid
concentration.
**** Ion pair extraction[edit] ****
It is possible by careful choice of counterion to extract a metal. For
instance, if the nitrate concentration is high, it is possible to extract
americium as an anionic nitrate complex if the mixture contains a lipophilic
quaternary_ammonium_salt.
An example that is more likely to be encountered by the 'average' chemist is
the use of a phase_transfer_catalyst. This is a charged species that transfers
another ion to the organic phase. The ion reacts and then forms another ion,
which is then transferred back to the aqueous phase.
For instance, the 31.1 kJ molâ1 is required to transfer an acetate anion into
nitrobenzene,[14] while the energy required to transfer a chloride anion from
an aqueous phase to nitrobenzene is 43.8 kJ molâ1.[15] Hence, if the aqueous
phase in a reaction is a solution of sodium_acetate while the organic phase is
a nitrobenzene solution of benzyl_chloride, then, when a phase transfer
catalyst, the acetate anions can be transferred from the aqueous layer where
they react with the benzyl chloride to form benzyl acetate and a chloride
anion. The chloride anion is then transferred to the aqueous phase. The
transfer energies of the anions contribute to that given out by the reaction.
A 43.8 to 31.1 kJ molâ1 = 12.7 kJ molâ1 of additional energy is given out
by the reaction when compared with energy if the reaction had been done in
nitrobenzene using one equivalent_weight of a tetraalkylammonium acetate.[16]
*** Types of aqueous two-phase extractions[edit] ***
Polymerâpolymer systems. In a Polymerâpolymer system, both phases are
generated by a dissolved polymer. The heavy phase will generally be a
polysaccharide, and the light phase is generally Polyethylene_glycol (PEG).
Traditionally, the polysaccharide used is dextran. However, dextran is
relatively expensive, and research has been exploring using less expensive
polysaccharides to generate the heavy phase. If the target compound being
separated is a protein or enzyme, it is possible to incorporate a ligand to the
target into one of the polymer phases. This improves the target's affinity to
that phase, and improves its ability to partition from one phase into the
other. This, as well as the absence of solvents or other denaturing agents,
makes polymerâpolymer extractions an attractive option for purifying
proteins. The two phases of a polymerâpolymer system often have very similar
densities, and very low surface tension between them. Because of this, demixing
a polymerâpolymer system is often much more difficult than demixing a solvent
extraction. Methods to improve the demixing include centrifugation, and
application of an electric_field.
Polymerâsalt systems. Aqueous two-phase systems can also be generated by
generating the heavy phase with a concentrated salt solution. The polymer phase
used is generally still PEG. Generally, a kosmotropic salt, such as Na3PO4 is
used, however PEGâNaCl systems have been documented when the salt
concentration is high enough. Since polymerâsalt systems demix readily they
are easier to use. However, at high salt concentrations, proteins generally
either denature, or precipitate from solution. Thus, polymerâsalt systems are
not as useful for purifying proteins.
Ionic liquids systems. Ionic_liquids are ionic compounds with low melting
points. While they are not technically aqueous, recent research has
experimented with using them in an extraction that does not use organic
solvents.

*** DNA purification[edit] ***
The ability to purify DNA from a sample is important for many modern
biotechnology processes. However, samples often contain nucleases that degrade
the target DNA before it can be purified. It has been shown that DNA fragments
will partition into the light phase of a polymerâsalt separation system. If
ligands known to bind and deactivate nucleases are incorporated into the
polymer phase, the nucleases will then partition into the heavy phase and be
deactivated. Thus, this polymerâsalt system is a useful tool for purifying
DNA from a sample while simultaneously protecting it from nucleases.
*** Food industry[edit] ***
The PEGâNaCl system has been shown to be effective at partitioning small
molecules, such as peptides and nucleic acids. These compounds are often
flavorants or odorants. The system could then be used by the food industry to
isolate or eliminate particular flavors. Caffeine extraction used to be done
using liquidâliquid extraction, specifically direct and indirect
liquidâliquid extraction (Swiss Water Method), but has since moved towards
super-critical CO2 as it is cheaper and can be done on a commercial scale.[17]
[18]
*** Analytical chemistry[edit] ***
Often there are chemical species present or necessary at one stage of sample
processing that will interfere with the analysis. For example, some air
monitoring is performed by drawing air through a small glass tube filled with
sorbent particles that have been coated with a chemical to stabilize or
derivatize the analyte of interest. The coating may be of such a concentration
or characteristics that it would damage the instrumentation or interfere with
the analysis. If the sample can be extracted from the sorbent using a nonpolar
solvent (such as toluene or carbon disulfide), and the coating is polar (such
as HBr or phosphoric acid) the dissolved coating will partition into the
aqueous phase. Clearly the reverse is true as well, using polar extraction
solvent and a nonpolar solvent to partition a nonpolar interferent. A small
aliquot of the organic phase (or in the latter case, polar phase) can then be
injected into the instrument for analysis.
*** Purification of amines[edit] ***
Amines (analogously to ammonia) have a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen
atom that can form a relatively weak bond to a hydrogen atom. It is therefore
the case that under acidic conditions amines are typically protonated, carrying
a positive charge and under basic conditions they are typically deprotonated
and neutral. Amines of sufficiently low molecular weight are rather polar and
can form hydrogen bonds with water and therefore will readily dissolve in
aqueous solutions. Deprotonated amines on the other hand, are neutral and have
greasy, nonpolar organic substituents, and therefore have a higher affinity for
nonpolar inorganic solvents. As such purification steps can be carried out
where an aqueous solution of an amine is neutralized with a base such as sodium
hydroxide, then shaken in a separatory_funnel with a nonpolar solvent that is
immiscible with water. The organic phase is then drained off. Subsequent
processing can recover the amine by techniques such as recrystallization,
evaporation or distillation; subsequent extraction back to a polar phase can be
performed by adding HCl and shaking again in a separatory funnel (at which
point the ammonium ion could be recovered by adding an insoluble counterion),
or in either phase, reactions could be performed as part of a chemical
synthesis.
***** Kinetics of extraction[edit] *****

It is important to investigate the rate at which the solute is transferred
between the two phases, in some cases by an alteration of the contact time it
is possible to alter the selectivity of the extraction. For instance, the
extraction of palladium or nickel can be very slow because the rate of ligand
exchange at these metal centers is much lower than the rates for iron or silver
complexes.
***** Aqueous complexing agents[edit] *****

If a complexing agent is present in the aqueous phase then it can lower the
distribution ratio. For instance, in the case of iodine being distributed
between water and an inert organic solvent such as carbon_tetrachloride then
the presence of iodide in the aqueous phase can alter the extraction chemistry.
Instead of      D    I   + 2       {\displaystyle D_{\mathrm {I} ^{+2}}}  [D_{{
{\mathrm  {I}}^{{+2}}}}] being a constant it becomes      D    I   + 2
{\displaystyle D_{\mathrm {I} ^{+2}}}  [D_{{{\mathrm  {I}}^{{+2}}}}] = k[
[I2.Organic]]/[I2.Aqueous] [[Iâ.Aqueous]]
This is because the iodine reacts with the iodide to form I3â. The I3â
anion is an example of a polyhalide anion that is quite common.
***** Industrial process design[edit] *****
In a typical scenario, an industrial process will use an extraction step in
which solutes are transferred from the aqueous phase to the organic phase; this
is often followed by a scrubbing stage in which unwanted solutes are removed
from the organic phase, then a stripping stage in which the wanted solutes are
removed from the organic phase. The organic phase may then be treated to make
it ready for use again.[19][20]
After use, the organic phase may be subjected to a cleaning step to remove any
degradation products; for instance, in PUREX plants, the used organic phase is
washed with sodium_carbonate solution to remove any dibutyl hydrogen phosphate
or butyl dihydrogen phosphate that might be present.
**** Liquid-liquid equilibrium calculations[edit] ****
In order to calculate the phase equilibrium, it is necessary to use a
thermodynamic model such as NRTL, UNIQUAC, etc. The corresponding parameters of
these models can be obtained from literature (e.g. Dechema Chemistry Data
Series, Dortmund_Data_Bank, etc.) or by a correlation process of experimental
data.[21][22][23][24]
***** Equipment[edit] *****
[File:Separation02.ogv]Play_media
Phase separation during a laboratory scale LLE. The upper organic ether
solution of MTBE is being extracted with the lower alkaline aqueous sodium
bicarbonate solution to remove benzoic_acid as the benzoate anion, leaving a
non-acidic organic, benzil, (yellow in color) in the organic phase.
While solvent extraction is often done on a small scale by synthetic lab
chemists using a separatory_funnel, Craig_apparatus or membrane-based
techniques,[25] it is normally done on the industrial scale using machines that
bring the two liquid phases into contact with each other. Such machines include
centrifugal_contactors, Thin_Layer_Extraction, spray_columns, pulsed_columns,
and mixer-settlers.
***** Extraction of metals[edit] *****
The extraction methods for a range of metals include:[26]
**** Cobalt[edit] ****
The extraction of cobalt from hydrochloric_acid using alamine_336 (tri-octyl/
decyl amine) in meta-xylene.[27] Cobalt can be extracted also using Cyanex_272_
{bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)_phosphinic_acid}.
**** Copper[edit] ****
Copper can be extracted using hydroxyoximes as extractants, a recent paper
describes an extractant that has a good selectivity for copper over cobalt and
nickel.[28]
**** Neodymium[edit] ****
The rare earth element Neodymium is extracted by di(2-ethyl-hexyl)phosphoric
acid into hexane by an ion exchange mechanism.[29]
**** Nickel[edit] ****
Nickel can be extracted using di(2-ethyl-hexyl)phosphoric acid and tributyl
phosphate in a hydrocarbon diluent (Shellsol).[30]
**** Palladium and platinum[edit] ****
Dialkyl sulfides, tributyl phosphate and alkyl amines have been used for
extracting palladium and platinum.[31][32]
**** Polonium[edit] ****
Polonium is produced in reactors from natural 209Bi, bombarded with neutrons,
creating 210Bi, which then decays to 210Po via beta-minus decay. The final
purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid-liquid extraction vs
sodium hydroxide at 500 deg C.[33]
**** Zinc and cadmium[edit] ****
Zinc and cadmium are both extracted by an ion exchange process, the
N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) acts as a masking
agent for the zinc and an extractant for the cadmium.[34] In the modified
Zincex process, zinc is separated from most divalent ions by solvent
extraction. D2EHPA (Di (2) ethyl hexyl phosphoric acid) is used for this. A
zinc ion replaces the proton from two D2EHPA molecules. To strip the zinc from
the D2EHPA, sulfuric acid is used, at a concentration of above 170g/l
(typically 240-265g/l).
