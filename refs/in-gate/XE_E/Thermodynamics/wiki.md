Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat and temperature,
and their relation to energy, work, radiation, and properties of matter. The
behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws_of_thermodynamics
which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical
quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by
statistical_mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in
science and engineering, especially physical_chemistry, chemical_engineering
and mechanical_engineering, but also in fields as complex as meteorology.
Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the
efficiency of early steam_engines, particularly through the work of French
physicist Nicolas_LÃ©onard_Sadi_Carnot (1824) who believed that engine
efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic_Wars.[1]
Scots-Irish physicist Lord_Kelvin was the first to formulate a concise
definition of thermodynamics in 1854[2] which stated, "Thermo-dynamics is the
subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of
bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency."
The initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical_heat_engines was
extended early on to the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions.
Chemical_thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the
process of chemical_reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and
knowledge of the field.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Other formulations of
thermodynamics emerged. Statistical_thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics,
concerns itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of
particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin_CarathÃ©odory
presented a purely mathematical approach in an axiomatic formulation, a
description often referred to as geometrical thermodynamics.

***** Introduction[edit] *****
A description of any thermodynamic system employs the four laws_of
thermodynamics that form an axiomatic basis. The first law specifies that
energy can be exchanged between physical systems as heat and work.[12] The
second law defines the existence of a quantity called entropy, that describes
the direction, thermodynamically, that a system can evolve and quantifies the
state of order of a system and that can be used to quantify the useful work
that can be extracted from the system.[13]
In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied
and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of the thermodynamic system
and its surroundings. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions
define its properties, and those properties are in turn related to one another
through equations_of_state. Properties can be combined to express internal
energy and thermodynamic_potentials, which are useful for determining
conditions for equilibrium and spontaneous_processes.
With these tools, thermodynamics can be used to describe how systems respond to
changes in their environment. This can be applied to a wide variety of topics
in science and engineering, such as engines, phase_transitions, chemical
reactions, transport_phenomena, and even black_holes. The results of
thermodynamics are essential for other fields of physics and for chemistry,
chemical_engineering, corrosion_engineering, aerospace_engineering, mechanical
engineering, cell_biology, biomedical_engineering, materials_science, and
economics, to name a few.[14][15]
This article is focused mainly on classical thermodynamics which primarily
studies systems in thermodynamic_equilibrium. Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics is
often treated as an extension of the classical treatment, but statistical
mechanics has brought many advances to that field.
The thermodynamicists representative of the original eight founding schools of
thermodynamics. The schools with the most-lasting effect in founding the modern
versions of thermodynamics are the Berlin school, particularly as established
in Rudolf_Clausiusâs 1865 textbook The Mechanical Theory of Heat, the Vienna
school, with the statistical_mechanics of Ludwig_Boltzmann, and the Gibbsian
school at Yale University, American engineer Willard_Gibbs' 1876 On_the
Equilibrium_of_Heterogeneous_Substances launching chemical_thermodynamics.[16]
***** History[edit] *****
The history_of_thermodynamics as a scientific discipline generally begins with
Otto_von_Guericke who, in 1650, built and designed the world's first vacuum
pump and demonstrated a vacuum using his Magdeburg_hemispheres. Guericke was
driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove Aristotle's long-held supposition
that 'nature abhors a vacuum'. Shortly after Guericke, the English physicist
and chemist Robert_Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and, in 1656, in
coordination with English scientist Robert_Hooke, built an air pump.[17] Using
this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed a correlation between pressure, temperature,
and volume. In time, Boyle's_Law was formulated, which states that pressure and
volume are inversely_proportional. Then, in 1679, based on these concepts, an
associate of Boyle's named Denis_Papin built a steam_digester, which was a
closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confined steam until a high
pressure was generated.
Later designs implemented a steam release valve that kept the machine from
exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived
of the idea of a piston and a cylinder engine. He did not, however, follow
through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs,
engineer Thomas_Savery built the first engine, followed by Thomas_Newcomen in
1712. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted
the attention of the leading scientists of the time.
The fundamental concepts of heat_capacity and latent_heat, which were necessary
for the development of thermodynamics, were developed by Professor Joseph_Black
at the University of Glasgow, where James_Watt was employed as an instrument
maker. Black and Watt performed experiments together, but it was Watt who
conceived the idea of the external_condenser which resulted in a large increase
in steam_engine efficiency.[18] Drawing on all the previous work led Sadi
Carnot, the "father of thermodynamics", to publish Reflections_on_the_Motive
Power_of_Fire (1824), a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency.
The book outlined the basic energetic relations between the Carnot_engine, the
Carnot_cycle, and motive_power. It marked the start of thermodynamics as a
modern science.[10]
The first thermodynamic textbook was written in 1859 by William_Rankine,
originally trained as a physicist and a civil and mechanical engineering
professor at the University_of_Glasgow.[19] The first and second laws of
thermodynamics emerged simultaneously in the 1850s, primarily out of the works
of William_Rankine, Rudolf_Clausius, and William_Thomson (Lord Kelvin).
The foundations of statistical thermodynamics were set out by physicists such
as James_Clerk_Maxwell, Ludwig_Boltzmann, Max_Planck, Rudolf_Clausius and J.
Willard_Gibbs.
During the years 1873â76 the American mathematical physicist Josiah_Willard
Gibbs published a series of three papers, the most famous being On_the
Equilibrium_of_Heterogeneous_Substances,[3] in which he showed how
thermodynamic_processes, including chemical_reactions, could be graphically
analyzed, by studying the energy, entropy, volume, temperature and pressure of
the thermodynamic_system in such a manner, one can determine if a process would
occur spontaneously.[20] Also Pierre_Duhem in the 19th century wrote about
chemical thermodynamics.[4] During the early 20th century, chemists such as
Gilbert_N._Lewis, Merle_Randall,[5] and E._A._Guggenheim[6][7] applied the
mathematical methods of Gibbs to the analysis of chemical processes.
***** Etymology[edit] *****
The etymology of thermodynamics has an intricate history.[21] It was first
spelled in a hyphenated form as an adjective (thermo-dynamic) and from 1854 to
1868 as the noun thermo-dynamics to represent the science of generalized heat
engines.[21]
American biophysicist Donald Haynie claims that thermodynamics was coined in
1840 from the Greek root Î¸Î­ÏÎ¼Î· therme, meaning heat and Î´ÏÎ½Î±Î¼Î¹Ï
dynamis, meaning power.[22] However, this etymology has been cited as unlikely.
[21]
Pierre Perrot claims that the term thermodynamics was coined by James_Joule in
1858 to designate the science of relations between heat and power,[10] however,
Joule never used that term, but used instead the term perfect thermo-dynamic
engine in reference to Thomson's 1849[23] phraseology.[21]
By 1858, thermo-dynamics, as a functional term, was used in William_Thomson's
paper "An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat."[23]
***** Branches of thermodynamics[edit] *****
The study of thermodynamical systems has developed into several related
branches, each using a different fundamental model as a theoretical or
experimental basis, or applying the principles to varying types of systems.
**** Classical thermodynamics[edit] ****
Classical thermodynamics is the description of the states of thermodynamic
systems at near-equilibrium, that uses macroscopic, measurable properties. It
is used to model exchanges of energy, work and heat based on the laws_of
thermodynamics. The qualifier classical reflects the fact that it represents
the first level of understanding of the subject as it developed in the 19th
century and describes the changes of a system in terms of macroscopic empirical
(large scale, and measurable) parameters. A microscopic interpretation of these
concepts was later provided by the development of statistical mechanics.
**** Statistical mechanics[edit] ****
Statistical_mechanics, also called statistical thermodynamics, emerged with the
development of atomic and molecular theories in the late 19th century and early
20th century, and supplemented classical thermodynamics with an interpretation
of the microscopic interactions between individual particles or quantum-
mechanical states. This field relates the microscopic properties of individual
atoms and molecules to the macroscopic, bulk properties of materials that can
be observed on the human scale, thereby explaining classical thermodynamics as
a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and quantum_theory at the
microscopic level.
[Thermodynamics_navigation_image.svg]
**** Chemical thermodynamics[edit] ****
Chemical_thermodynamics is the study of the interrelation of energy with
chemical_reactions or with a physical change of state within the confines of
the laws_of_thermodynamics.
**** Equilibrium thermodynamics[edit] ****
Equilibrium_thermodynamics is the systematic study of transfers of matter and
energy in systems as they pass from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to
another. The term 'thermodynamic equilibrium' indicates a state of balance. In
an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, or driving forces,
between macroscopically distinct parts of the system. A central aim in
equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial
equilibrium state, and given its surroundings, and given its constitutive
walls, to calculate what will be the final equilibrium state of the system
after a specified thermodynamic operation has changed its walls or
surroundings.
Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with
systems that are not in thermodynamic_equilibrium. Most systems found in nature
are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states,
and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy
to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems
requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium
thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of
currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.
***** Laws of thermodynamics[edit] *****
Main article: Laws_of_thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is principally based on a set of four laws which are universally
valid when applied to systems that fall within the constraints implied by each.
In the various theoretical descriptions of thermodynamics these laws may be
expressed in seemingly differing forms, but the most prominent formulations are
the following:
    * Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics: If two systems are each in thermal
      equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each
      other.
This statement implies that thermal equilibrium is an equivalence_relation on
the set of thermodynamic_systems under consideration. Systems are said to be in
equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. Brownian_motion)
do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every
measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide if two bodies are at
the same temperature, it is not necessary to bring them into contact and
measure any changes of their observable properties in time.[24] The law
provides an empirical definition of temperature and justification for the
construction of practical thermometers.
The zeroth law was not initially named as a law of thermodynamics, as its basis
in thermodynamical equilibrium was implied in the other laws. The first,
second, and third laws had been explicitly stated prior and found common
acceptance in the physics community. Once the importance of the zeroth law for
the definition of temperature was realized, it was impracticable to renumber
the other laws, hence it was numbered the zeroth law.
    * First_law_of_thermodynamics: The internal energy of an isolated system is
      constant.
The first law of thermodynamics is an expression of the principle of
conservation_of_energy. It states that energy can be transformed (changed from
one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed.[25]
The first law is usually formulated by saying that the change in the internal
energy of a closed thermodynamic_system is equal to the difference between the
heat supplied to the system and the amount of work done by the system on its
surroundings. It is important to note that internal energy is a state of the
system (see Thermodynamic_state) whereas heat and work modify the state of the
system. In other words, a change of internal energy of a system may be achieved
by any combination of heat and work energy added or removed from the system
where the change of internal energy is equal to the sum of these two. The
equilibrium internal energy does not depend on the manner by which the system
arrives at this state, i.e., it is path independent.
    * Second_law_of_thermodynamics: Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a
      colder location to a hotter location.
The second law of thermodynamics is an expression of the universal principle of
decay observable in nature. The second law is an observation of the fact that
over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential tend to
even out in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. Entropy
is a measure of how much this process has progressed. The entropy of an
isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time,
approaching a maximum value at equilibrium. However, principles guiding systems
that are far from equilibrium are still debatable. One of such principles is
the maximum_entropy_production principle.[26][27] It states that non-
equilibrium systems behave such a way as to maximize its entropy production.
[28]
In classical thermodynamics, the second law is a basic postulate applicable to
any system involving heat energy transfer; in statistical thermodynamics, the
second law is a consequence of the assumed randomness of molecular chaos. There
are many versions of the second law, but they all have the same effect, which
is to explain the phenomenon of irreversibility in nature.
    * Third_law_of_thermodynamics: As a system approaches absolute zero, all
      processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.
The third law of thermodynamics is a statistical law of nature regarding
entropy and the impossibility of reaching absolute_zero of temperature. This
law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy. The
entropy determined relative to this point is the absolute entropy. Alternate
definitions include "the entropy of all systems and of all states of a system
is smallest at absolute zero," or equivalently "it is impossible to reach the
absolute zero of temperature by any finite number of processes".
Absolute zero, at which all activity would stop if it were possible to achieve,
is â273.15 Â°C (degrees Celsius), or â459.67 Â°F (degrees Fahrenheit), or 0
K (kelvin), or 0Â° R (degrees Rankine).
***** System models[edit] *****
A diagram of a generic thermodynamic system
An important concept in thermodynamics is the thermodynamic_system, which is a
precisely defined region of the universe under study. Everything in the
universe except the system is called the surroundings. A system is separated
from the remainder of the universe by a boundary which may be a physical
boundary or notional, but which by convention defines a finite volume.
Exchanges of work, heat, or matter between the system and the surroundings take
place across this boundary.
In practice, the boundary of a system is simply an imaginary dotted line drawn
around a volume within which is going to be a change in the internal_energy of
that volume. Anything that passes across the boundary that effects a change in
the internal energy of the system needs to be accounted for in the energy
balance equation. The volume can be the region surrounding a single atom
resonating energy, such as Max_Planck defined in 1900; it can be a body of
steam or air in a steam_engine, such as Sadi_Carnot defined in 1824; it can be
the body of a tropical_cyclone, such as Kerry_Emanuel theorized in 1986 in the
field of atmospheric_thermodynamics; it could also be just one nuclide (i.e. a
system of quarks) as hypothesized in quantum_thermodynamics, or the event
horizon of a black_hole.
Boundaries are of four types: fixed, movable, real, and imaginary. For example,
in an engine, a fixed boundary means the piston is locked at its position,
within which a constant volume process might occur. If the piston is allowed to
move that boundary is movable while the cylinder and cylinder head boundaries
are fixed. For closed systems, boundaries are real while for open systems
boundaries are often imaginary. In the case of a jet engine, a fixed imaginary
boundary might be assumed at the intake of the engine, fixed boundaries along
the surface of the case and a second fixed imaginary boundary across the
exhaust nozzle.
Generally, thermodynamics distinguishes three classes of systems, defined in
terms of what is allowed to cross their boundaries:
             Interactions of thermodynamic systems
Type of system        Mass_flow     Work          Heat
Open                  [Green tick]Y [Green tick]Y [Green tick]Y
Closed                [Red X]N      [Green tick]Y [Green tick]Y
Thermally_isolated    [Red X]N      [Green tick]Y [Red X]N
Mechanically_isolated [Red X]N      [Red X]N      [Green tick]Y
Isolated              [Red X]N      [Red X]N      [Red X]N
As time passes in an isolated system, internal differences of pressures,
densities, and temperatures tend to even out. A system in which all equalizing
processes have gone to completion is said to be in a state of thermodynamic
equilibrium.
Once in thermodynamic equilibrium, a system's properties are, by definition,
unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium are much simpler and easier to
understand than are systems which are not in equilibrium. Often, when analysing
a dynamic thermodynamic process, the simplifying assumption is made that each
intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium, producing thermodynamic
processes which develop so slowly as to allow each intermediate step to be an
equilibrium state and are said to be reversible_processes.
***** States and processes[edit] *****
When a system is at equilibrium under a given set of conditions, it is said to
be in a definite thermodynamic_state. The state of the system can be described
by a number of state_quantities that do not depend on the process by which the
system arrived at its state. They are called intensive_variables or extensive
variables according to how they change when the size of the system changes. The
properties of the system can be described by an equation_of_state which
specifies the relationship between these variables. State may be thought of as
the instantaneous quantitative description of a system with a set number of
variables held constant.
A thermodynamic_process may be defined as the energetic evolution of a
thermodynamic system proceeding from an initial state to a final state. It can
be described by process_quantities. Typically, each thermodynamic process is
distinguished from other processes in energetic character according to what
parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or volume, etc., are held fixed;
Furthermore, it is useful to group these processes into pairs, in which each
variable held constant is one member of a conjugate pair.
Several commonly studied thermodynamic processes are:
    * Adiabatic_process: occurs without loss or gain of energy by heat
    * Isenthalpic_process: occurs at a constant enthalpy
    * Isentropic_process: a reversible adiabatic process, occurs at a constant
      entropy
    * Isobaric_process: occurs at constant pressure
    * Isochoric_process: occurs at constant volume (also called isometric/
      isovolumetric)
    * Isothermal_process: occurs at a constant temperature
    * Steady_state_process: occurs without a change in the internal_energy
***** Instrumentation[edit] *****
There are two types of thermodynamic_instruments, the meter and the reservoir.
A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a
thermodynamic_system. In some cases, the thermodynamic parameter is actually
defined in terms of an idealized measuring instrument. For example, the zeroth
law states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body,
they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle, as noted
by James_Maxwell in 1872, asserts that it is possible to measure temperature.
An idealized thermometer is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure. From
the ideal_gas_law pV=nRT, the volume of such a sample can be used as an
indicator of temperature; in this manner it defines temperature. Although
pressure is defined mechanically, a pressure-measuring device, called a
barometer may also be constructed from a sample of an ideal gas held at a
constant temperature. A calorimeter is a device which is used to measure and
define the internal energy of a system.
A thermodynamic reservoir is a system which is so large that its state
parameters are not appreciably altered when it is brought into contact with the
system of interest. When the reservoir is brought into contact with the system,
the system is brought into equilibrium with the reservoir. For example, a
pressure reservoir is a system at a particular pressure, which imposes that
pressure upon the system to which it is mechanically connected. The Earth's
atmosphere is often used as a pressure reservoir. If ocean water is used to
cool a power plant, the ocean is often a temperature reservoir in the analysis
of the power plant cycle.
***** Conjugate variables[edit] *****
Main article: Conjugate_variables
The central concept of thermodynamics is that of energy, the ability to do
work. By the First_Law, the total energy of a system and its surroundings is
conserved. Energy may be transferred into a system by heating, compression, or
addition of matter, and extracted from a system by cooling, expansion, or
extraction of matter. In mechanics, for example, energy transfer equals the
product of the force applied to a body and the resulting displacement.
Conjugate_variables are pairs of thermodynamic concepts, with the first being
akin to a "force" applied to some thermodynamic_system, the second being akin
to the resulting "displacement," and the product of the two equalling the
amount of energy transferred. The common conjugate variables are:
    * Pressure-volume (the mechanical parameters);
    * Temperature-entropy (thermal parameters);
    * Chemical_potential-particle_number (material parameters).
***** Potentials[edit] *****
Thermodynamic_potentials are different quantitative measures of the stored
energy in a system. Potentials are used to measure the energy changes in
systems as they evolve from an initial state to a final state. The potential
used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or
pressure. For example, the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are the energies
available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the
pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively.
The five most well known potentials are:

applied to a thermodynamic system. Other thermodynamic potentials can also be
