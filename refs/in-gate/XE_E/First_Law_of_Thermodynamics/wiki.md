The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation_of
energy, adapted for thermodynamic_systems. The law of conservation of energy
states that the total energy of an isolated_system is constant; energy can be
transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.
The first law is often formulated[1][nb_1]
         &#x0394; U = Q &#x2212; W .   {\displaystyle \Delta U=Q-W.}  [
      {\displaystyle \Delta U=Q-W.}]
It states that the change in the internal_energy ÎU of a closed_system is
equal to the amount of heat Q supplied to the system, minus the amount of work
W done by the system on its surroundings. An equivalent statement is that
perpetual_motion_machines of the first kind are impossible.

***** History *****
Investigations into the nature of heat and work and their relationship began
with the invention of the first engines used to extract water from mines.
Improvements to such engines so as to increase their efficiency and power
output came first from mechanics that worked with such machines but only slowly
advanced the art. Deeper investigations that placed those on a mathematical and
physics basis came later.[citation_needed]
The first law of thermodynamics was developed empirically over about half a
century. The first full statements of the law came in 1850 from Rudolf_Clausius
and from William_Rankine; Rankine's statement is considered less distinct
relative to Clausius'.[2] A main aspect of the struggle was to deal with the
previously proposed caloric_theory of heat.
In 1840, Germain_Hess stated a conservation_law for the so-called 'heat of
reaction' for chemical reactions.[3] His law was later recognized as a
consequence of the first law of thermodynamics, but Hess's statement was not
explicitly concerned with the relation between energy exchanges by heat and
work.
According to Truesdell (1980), Julius_Robert_von_Mayer in 1841 made a statement
that meant that "in a process at constant pressure, the heat used to produce
expansion is universally interconvertible with work", but this is not a general
statement of the first law.[4][5]
**** Original statements: the "thermodynamic approach" ****
The original nineteenth century statements of the first law of thermodynamics
appeared in a conceptual framework in which transfer of energy as heat was
taken as a primitive_notion, not defined or constructed by the theoretical
development of the framework, but rather presupposed as prior to it and already
accepted. The primitive notion of heat was taken as empirically established,
especially through calorimetry regarded as a subject in its own right, prior to
thermodynamics. Jointly primitive with this notion of heat were the notions of
empirical temperature and thermal equilibrium. This framework also took as
primitive the notion of transfer of energy as work. This framework did not
presume a concept of energy in general, but regarded it as derived or
synthesized from the prior notions of heat and work. By one author, this
framework has been called the "thermodynamic" approach.[6]
The first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics, by Rudolf
Clausius in 1850, referred to cyclic thermodynamic processes.
            In all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat, a
            quantity of heat is consumed which is proportional to the work
            done; and conversely, by the expenditure of an equal quantity of
            work an equal quantity of heat is produced.[7]
Clausius also stated the law in another form, referring to the existence of a
function of state of the system, the internal_energy, and expressed it in terms
of a differential equation for the increments of a thermodynamic process.[8]
This equation may be described as follows:
            In a thermodynamic process involving a closed system, the increment
            in the internal energy is equal to the difference between the heat
            accumulated by the system and the work done by it.
Because of its definition in terms of increments, the value of the internal
energy of a system is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an
arbitrary additive constant of integration, which can be adjusted to give
arbitrary reference zero levels. This non-uniqueness is in keeping with the
abstract mathematical nature of the internal energy. The internal energy is
customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state
of the system.
The concept of internal energy is considered by Bailyn to be of "enormous
interest". Its quantity cannot be immediately measured, but can only be
inferred, by differencing actual immediate measurements. Bailyn likens it to
the energy states of an atom, that were revealed by Bohr's energy relation hÎ½
= En'' â En'. In each case, an unmeasurable quantity (the internal energy,
the atomic energy level) is revealed by considering the difference of measured
quantities (increments of internal energy, quantities of emitted or absorbed
radiative energy).[9]
**** Conceptual revision: the "mechanical approach" ****
In 1907, George_H._Bryan wrote about systems between which there is no transfer
of matter (closed systems): "Definition. When energy flows from one system or
part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical
work, the energy so transferred is called heat."[10] This definition may be
regarded as expressing a conceptual revision, as follows. This was
systematically expounded in 1909 by Constantin_CarathÃ©odory, whose attention
had been drawn to it by Max_Born. Largely through Born's[11] influence, this
revised conceptual approach to the definition of heat came to be preferred by
many twentieth-century writers. It might be called the "mechanical approach".
[12]
Energy can also be transferred from one thermodynamic system to another in
association with transfer of matter. Born points out that in general such
energy transfer is not resolvable uniquely into work and heat moieties. In
general, when there is transfer of energy associated with matter transfer, work
and heat transfers can be distinguished only when they pass through walls
physically separate from those for matter transfer.
The "mechanical" approach postulates the law of conservation of energy. It also
postulates that energy can be transferred from one thermodynamic system to
another adiabatically as work, and that energy can be held as the internal
energy of a thermodynamic system. It also postulates that energy can be
transferred from one thermodynamic system to another by a path that is non-
adiabatic, and is unaccompanied by matter transfer. Initially, it "cleverly"
(according to Bailyn) refrains from labelling as 'heat' such non-adiabatic,
unaccompanied transfer of energy. It rests on the primitive notion of walls,
especially adiabatic walls and non-adiabatic walls, defined as follows.
Temporarily, only for purpose of this definition, one can prohibit transfer of
energy as work across a wall of interest. Then walls of interest fall into two
classes, (a) those such that arbitrary systems separated by them remain
independently in their own previously established respective states of internal
thermodynamic equilibrium; they are defined as adiabatic; and (b) those without
such independence; they are defined as non-adiabatic.[13]
This approach derives the notions of transfer of energy as heat, and of
temperature, as theoretical developments, not taking them as primitives. It
regards calorimetry as a derived theory. It has an early origin in the
nineteenth century, for example in the work of Helmholtz,[14] but also in the
work of many others.[6]
***** Conceptually revised statement, according to the mechanical approach
*****
The revised statement of the first law postulates that a change in the internal
energy of a system due to any arbitrary process, that takes the system from a
given initial thermodynamic state to a given final equilibrium thermodynamic
state, can be determined through the physical existence, for those given
states, of a reference process that occurs purely through stages of adiabatic
work.
The revised statement is then
            For a closed system, in any arbitrary process of interest that
            takes it from an initial to a final state of internal thermodynamic
            equilibrium, the change of internal energy is the same as that for
            a reference adiabatic work process that links those two states.
            This is so regardless of the path of the process of interest, and
            regardless of whether it is an adiabatic or a non-adiabatic
            process. The reference adiabatic work process may be chosen
            arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes.
This statement is much less close to the empirical basis than are the original
statements,[15] but is often regarded as conceptually parsimonious in that it
rests only on the concepts of adiabatic work and of non-adiabatic processes,
not on the concepts of transfer of energy as heat and of empirical temperature
that are presupposed by the original statements. Largely through the influence
of Max_Born, it is often regarded as theoretically preferable because of this
conceptual parsimony. Born particularly observes that the revised approach
avoids thinking in terms of what he calls the "imported engineering" concept of
heat engines.[11]
Basing his thinking on the mechanical approach, Born in 1921, and again in
1949, proposed to revise the definition of heat.[11][16] In particular, he
referred to the work of Constantin_CarathÃ©odory, who had in 1909 stated the
first law without defining quantity of heat.[17] Born's definition was
specifically for transfers of energy without transfer of matter, and it has
been widely followed in textbooks (examples:[18][19][20]). Born observes that a
transfer of matter between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal
energy that cannot be resolved into heat and work components. There can be
pathways to other systems, spatially separate from that of the matter transfer,
that allow heat and work transfer independent of and simultaneous with the
matter transfer. Energy is conserved in such transfers.
***** Description *****
**** Cyclic processes ****
The first law of thermodynamics for a closed system was expressed in two ways
by Clausius. One way referred to cyclic processes and the inputs and outputs of
the system, but did not refer to increments in the internal state of the
system. The other way referred to an incremental change in the internal state
of the system, and did not expect the process to be cyclic.
A cyclic process is one that can be repeated indefinitely often, returning the
system to its initial state. Of particular interest for single cycle of a
cyclic process are the net work done, and the net heat taken in (or 'consumed',
in Clausius' statement), by the system.
In a cyclic process in which the system does net work on its surroundings, it
is observed to be physically necessary not only that heat be taken into the
system, but also, importantly, that some heat leave the system. The difference
is the heat converted by the cycle into work. In each repetition of a cyclic
process, the net work done by the system, measured in mechanical units, is
proportional to the heat consumed, measured in calorimetric units.
The constant of proportionality is universal and independent of the system and
in 1845 and 1847 was measured by James_Joule, who described it as the
mechanical_equivalent_of_heat.
**** Sign conventions ****
In a non-cyclic process, the change in the internal energy of a system is equal
to net energy added as heat to the system minus the net work done by the
system, both being measured in mechanical units. Taking ÎU as a change in
internal energy, one writes
         &#x0394; U = Q  &#x2212;  W      ( s i g n  c o n v e n t i o n  o f
      C l a u s i u s  a n d  g e n e r a l l y  i n  t h i s  a r t i c l e )
      ,   {\displaystyle \Delta U=Q\,-\,W\,\,\,\,\mathrm {
      (sign\,convention\,of\,Clausius\,and\,generally\,in\,this\,article)} ,}
      [{\displaystyle \Delta U=Q\,-\,W\,\,\,\,\mathrm {
      (sign\,convention\,of\,Clausius\,and\,generally\,in\,this\,article)} ,}]
where Q denotes the net quantity of heat supplied to the system by its
surroundings and W denotes the net work done by the system. This sign
convention is implicit in Clausius' statement of the law given above. It
originated with the study of heat_engines that produce useful work by
consumption of heat.
Often nowadays, however, writers use the IUPAC convention by which the first
law is formulated with work done on the system by its surroundings having a
positive sign. With this now often used sign convention for work, the first law
for a closed system may be written:
         &#x0394; U = Q + W      ( s i g n  c o n v e n t i o n  o f  I U P A C
      )  .   {\displaystyle \Delta U=Q+W\,\,\,\,\mathrm {
      (sign\,convention\,of\,IUPAC)} .}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
      U=Q+W\,\,\,\,\mathrm {(sign\,convention\,of\,IUPAC)} .}][21]
This convention follows physicists such as Max_Planck,[22] and considers all
net energy transfers to the system as positive and all net energy transfers
from the system as negative, irrespective of any use for the system as an
engine or other device.
When a system expands in a fictive quasistatic_process, the work done by the
system on the environment is the product, P dV,  of pressure, P, and volume
change, dV, whereas the work done on the system is  -P dV.  Using either sign
convention for work, the change in internal energy of the system is:
          d  U = &#x03B4; Q &#x2212; P   d  V      (quasi-static process)  ,
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U=\delta Q-P\,\mathrm {d} V\,\,\,\,{\text{
      (quasi-static process)}},}  [{\mathrm  d}U=\delta Q-P\,{\mathrm
      d}V\,\,\,\,{\text{(quasi-static process)}},]
where Î´Q denotes the infinitesimal amount of heat supplied to the system from
its surroundings and Î´ denotes an inexact_differential.
Work and heat are expressions of actual physical processes of supply or removal
of energy, while the internal energy U is a mathematical abstraction that keeps
account of the exchanges of energy that befall the system. Thus the term heat
for Q means "that amount of energy added or removed by conduction of heat or by
thermal radiation", rather than referring to a form of energy within the
system. Likewise, the term work energy for W means "that amount of energy
gained or lost as the result of work". Internal energy is a property of the
system whereas work done and heat supplied are not. A significant result of
this distinction is that a given internal energy change ÎU can be achieved by,
in principle, many combinations of heat and work.
***** Various statements of the law for closed systems *****
The law is of great importance and generality and is consequently thought of
from several points of view. Most careful textbook statements of the law
express it for closed systems. It is stated in several ways, sometimes even by
the same author.[6][23]
For the thermodynamics of closed systems, the distinction between transfers of
energy as work and as heat is central and is within the scope of the present
article. For the thermodynamics of open_systems, such a distinction is beyond
the scope of the present article, but some limited comments are made on it in
the section below headed 'First_law_of_thermodynamics_for_open_systems'.
There are two main ways of stating a law of thermodynamics, physically or
mathematically. They should be logically coherent and consistent with one
another.[24]
An example of a physical statement is that of Planck (1897/1903):
      It is in no way possible, either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or
      other devices, to obtain perpetual motion, i.e. it is impossible to
      construct an engine which will work in a cycle and produce continuous
      work, or kinetic energy, from nothing.[25]
This physical statement is restricted neither to closed systems nor to systems
with states that are strictly defined only for thermodynamic equilibrium; it
has meaning also for open systems and for systems with states that are not in
thermodynamic equilibrium.
An example of a mathematical statement is that of Crawford (1963):
                                    For a given system we let ÎE kin = large-
                                    scale mechanical energy, ÎE pot = large-
                                    scale potential energy, and ÎE tot = total
                                    energy. The first two quantities are
                                    specifiable in terms of appropriate

This statement by Crawford, for W, uses the sign convention of IUPAC, not that
of Clausius. Though it does not explicitly say so, this statement refers to
closed systems, and to internal energy U defined for bodies in states of
thermodynamic equilibrium, which possess well-defined temperatures.
The history of statements of the law for closed systems has two main periods,
before and after the work of Bryan (1907),[27] of CarathÃ©odory (1909),[17] and
the approval of CarathÃ©odory's work given by Born (1921).[16] The earlier
traditional versions of the law for closed systems are nowadays often
considered to be out of date.
CarathÃ©odory's celebrated presentation of equilibrium thermodynamics[17]
refers to closed systems, which are allowed to contain several phases connected
by internal walls of various kinds of impermeability and permeability
(explicitly including walls that are permeable only to heat). CarathÃ©odory's
1909 version of the first law of thermodynamics was stated in an axiom which
refrained from defining or mentioning temperature or quantity of heat
transferred. That axiom stated that the internal energy of a phase in
equilibrium is a function of state, that the sum of the internal energies of
the phases is the total internal energy of the system, and that the value of
the total internal energy of the system is changed by the amount of work done
adiabatically on it, considering work as a form of energy. That article
considered this statement to be an expression of the law of conservation of
energy for such systems. This version is nowadays widely accepted as
authoritative, but is stated in slightly varied ways by different authors.
Such statements of the first law for closed systems assert the existence of
internal energy as a function of state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus
heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference. It is
defined as a residual difference between change of internal energy and work
done on the system, when that work does not account for the whole of the change
of internal energy and the system is not adiabatically isolated.[18][19][20]
The 1909 CarathÃ©odory statement of the law in axiomatic form does not mention
heat or temperature, but the equilibrium states to which it refers are
explicitly defined by variable sets that necessarily include "non-deformation
variables", such as pressures, which, within reasonable restrictions, can be
rightly interpreted as empirical temperatures,[28] and the walls connecting the
phases of the system are explicitly defined as possibly impermeable to heat or
permeable only to heat.
According to MÃ¼nster (1970), "A somewhat unsatisfactory aspect of
CarathÃ©odory's theory is that a consequence of the Second Law must be
considered at this point [in the statement of the first law], i.e. that it is
not always possible to reach any state 2 from any other state 1 by means of an
adiabatic process." MÃ¼nster instances that no adiabatic process can reduce the
internal energy of a system at constant volume.[18] CarathÃ©odory's paper
asserts that its statement of the first law corresponds exactly to Joule's
experimental arrangement, regarded as an instance of adiabatic work. It does
not point out that Joule's experimental arrangement performed essentially
irreversible work, through friction of paddles in a liquid, or passage of
electric current through a resistance inside the system, driven by motion of a
coil and inductive heating, or by an external current source, which can access
the system only by the passage of electrons, and so is not strictly adiabatic,
because electrons are a form of matter, which cannot penetrate adiabatic walls.
The paper goes on to base its main argument on the possibility of quasi-static
adiabatic work, which is essentially reversible. The paper asserts that it will
avoid reference to Carnot cycles, and then proceeds to base its argument on
cycles of forward and backward quasi-static adiabatic stages, with isothermal
stages of zero magnitude.
Sometimes the concept of internal energy is not made explicit in the statement.
[29][30][31]
Sometimes the existence of the internal energy is made explicit but work is not
explicitly mentioned in the statement of the first postulate of thermodynamics.
Heat supplied is then defined as the residual change in internal energy after
work has been taken into account, in a non-adiabatic process.[32]
A respected modern author states the first law of thermodynamics as "Heat is a
form of energy", which explicitly mentions neither internal energy nor
adiabatic work. Heat is defined as energy transferred by thermal contact with a
reservoir, which has a temperature, and is generally so large that addition and
removal of heat do not alter its temperature.[33] A current student text on
chemistry defines heat thus: "heat is the exchange of thermal energy between a
system and its surroundings caused by a temperature difference." The author
then explains how heat is defined or measured by calorimetry, in terms of heat
capacity, specific heat capacity, molar heat capacity, and temperature.[34]
A respected text disregards the CarathÃ©odory's exclusion of mention of heat
from the statement of the first law for closed systems, and admits heat
calorimetrically defined along with work and internal energy.[35] Another
respected text defines heat exchange as determined by temperature difference,
but also mentions that the Born (1921) version is "completely rigorous".[36]
These versions follow the traditional approach that is now considered out of
date, exemplified by that of Planck (1897/1903).[37]
***** Evidence for the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems *****
The first law of thermodynamics for closed systems was originally induced from
empirically observed evidence, including calorimetric evidence. It is nowadays,
however, taken to provide the definition of heat via the law of conservation of
energy and the definition of work in terms of changes in the external
parameters of a system. The original discovery of the law was gradual over a
period of perhaps half a century or more, and some early studies were in terms
of cyclic processes.[2]
The following is an account in terms of changes of state of a closed system
through compound processes that are not necessarily cyclic. This account first
considers processes for which the first law is easily verified because of their
simplicity, namely adiabatic_processes (in which there is no transfer as heat)
and adynamic_processes (in which there is no transfer as work).
**** Adiabatic processes ****
In an adiabatic process, there is transfer of energy as work but not as heat.
For all adiabatic process that takes a system from a given initial state to a
given final state, irrespective of how the work is done, the respective
eventual total quantities of energy transferred as work are one and the same,
determined just by the given initial and final states. The work done on the
system is defined and measured by changes in mechanical or quasi-mechanical
variables external to the system. Physically, adiabatic transfer of energy as
work requires the existence of adiabatic enclosures.
For instance, in Joule's experiment, the initial system is a tank of water with
a paddle wheel inside. If we isolate the tank thermally, and move the paddle
wheel with a pulley and a weight, we can relate the increase in temperature
with the distance descended by the mass. Next, the system is returned to its
initial state, isolated again, and the same amount of work is done on the tank
using different devices (an electric motor, a chemical battery, a spring,...).
In every case, the amount of work can be measured independently. The return to
the initial state is not conducted by doing adiabatic work on the system. The
evidence shows that the final state of the water (in particular, its
temperature and volume) is the same in every case. It is irrelevant if the work
is electrical, mechanical, chemical,... or if done suddenly or slowly, as long
as it is performed in an adiabatic way, that is to say, without heat transfer
into or out of the system.
Evidence of this kind shows that to increase the temperature of the water in
the tank, the qualitative kind of adiabatically performed work does not matter.
No qualitative kind of adiabatic work has ever been observed to decrease the
temperature of the water in the tank.
A change from one state to another, for example an increase of both temperature
and volume, may be conducted in several stages, for example by externally
supplied electrical work on a resistor in the body, and adiabatic expansion
allowing the body to do work on the surroundings. It needs to be shown that the
time order of the stages, and their relative magnitudes, does not affect the
amount of adiabatic work that needs to be done for the change of state.
According to one respected scholar: "Unfortunately, it does not seem that
experiments of this kind have ever been carried out carefully. ... We must
therefore admit that the statement which we have enunciated here, and which is
equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics, is not well founded on direct
experimental evidence."[15] Another expression of this view is "... no
systematic precise experiments to verify this generalization directly have ever
been attempted."[38]
This kind of evidence, of independence of sequence of stages, combined with the
above-mentioned evidence, of independence of qualitative kind of work, would
show the existence of an important state variable that corresponds with
adiabatic work, but not that such a state variable represented a conserved
quantity. For the latter, another step of evidence is needed, which may be
related to the concept of reversibility, as mentioned below.
That important state variable was first recognized and denoted     U
{\displaystyle U}  [U] by Clausius in 1850, but he did not then name it, and he
defined it in terms not only of work but also of heat transfer in the same
process. It was also independently recognized in 1850 by Rankine, who also
denoted it     U   {\displaystyle U}  [U] ; and in 1851 by Kelvin who then
called it "mechanical energy", and later "intrinsic energy". In 1865, after
some hestitation, Clausius began calling his state function     U
{\displaystyle U}  [U] "energy". In 1882 it was named as the internal_energy by
Helmholtz.[39] If only adiabatic processes were of interest, and heat could be
ignored, the concept of internal energy would hardly arise or be needed. The
relevant physics would be largely covered by the concept of potential energy,
as was intended in the 1847 paper of Helmholtz on the principle of conservation
of energy, though that did not deal with forces that cannot be described by a
potential, and thus did not fully justify the principle. Moreover, that paper
was critical of the early work of Joule that had by then been performed.[40] A
great merit of the internal energy concept is that it frees thermodynamics from
a restriction to cyclic processes, and allows a treatment in terms of
thermodynamic states.
In an adiabatic process, adiabatic work takes the system either from a
reference state     O   {\displaystyle O}  [O] with internal energy     U ( O )
{\displaystyle U(O)}  [U(O)] to an arbitrary one     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A]
with internal energy     U ( A )   {\displaystyle U(A)}  [U(A)], or from the
state     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A] to the state     O   {\displaystyle O}
[O]:
         U ( A ) = U ( O ) &#x2212;  W  O &#x2192; A    a d i a b a t i c
      o r    U ( O ) = U ( A ) &#x2212;  W  A &#x2192; O    a d i a b a t i c
      .   {\displaystyle U(A)=U(O)-W_{O\to A}^{\mathrm {adiabatic} }\,\,\mathrm
      {or} \,\,U(O)=U(A)-W_{A\to O}^{\mathrm {adiabatic} }\,.}  [U(A)=U(O)-W_{
      {O\to A}}^{{\mathrm  {adiabatic}}}\,\,{\mathrm  {or}}\,\,U(O)=U(A)-W_{
      {A\to O}}^{{\mathrm  {adiabatic}}}\,.]
Except under the special, and strictly speaking, fictional, condition of
reversibility, only one of the processes       a d i a b a t i c  ,  O &#x2192;
A   {\displaystyle \mathrm {adiabatic} ,\,O\to A}  [{\mathrm
{adiabatic}},\,O\to A]   or       a d i a b a t i c  ,   A &#x2192; O
{\displaystyle \mathrm {adiabatic} ,\,{A\to O}\,}  [{\mathrm  {adiabatic}},\,
{A\to O}\,]  is empirically feasible by a simple application of externally
supplied work. The reason for this is given as the second law of thermodynamics
and is not considered in the present article.
The fact of such irreversibility may be dealt with in two main ways, according
to different points of view:
    * Since the work of Bryan (1907), the most accepted way to deal with it
      nowadays, followed by CarathÃ©odory,[17][20][41] is to rely on the
      previously established concept of quasi-static processes,[42][43][44] as
      follows. Actual physical processes of transfer of energy as work are
      always at least to some degree irreversible. The irreversibility is often
      due to mechanisms known as dissipative, that transform bulk kinetic
      energy into internal energy. Examples are friction and viscosity. If the
      process is performed more slowly, the frictional or viscous dissipation
      is less. In the limit of infinitely slow performance, the dissipation
      tends to zero and then the limiting process, though fictional rather than
      actual, is notionally reversible, and is called quasi-static. Throughout
      the course of the fictional limiting quasi-static process, the internal
      intensive variables of the system are equal to the external intensive
      variables, those that describe the reactive forces exerted by the
      surroundings.[45] This can be taken to justify the formula
         ( 1 )         W  A &#x2192; O   adiabatic, quasi-static   = &#x2212;
      W  O &#x2192; A   adiabatic, quasi-static    .   {\displaystyle
      (1)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,W_{A\to O}^{\text{adiabatic, quasi-static}}=-W_{O\to A}^
      {\text{adiabatic, quasi-static}}\,.}  [(1)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,W_{{A\to O}}^{
      {\text{adiabatic, quasi-static}}}=-W_{{O\to A}}^{{\text{adiabatic, quasi-
      static}}}\,.]
    * Another way to deal with it is to allow that experiments with processes
      of heat transfer to or from the system may be used to justify the formula
      (1) above. Moreover, it deals to some extent with the problem of lack of
      direct experimental evidence that the time order of stages of a process
      does not matter in the determination of internal energy. This way does
      not provide theoretical purity in terms of adiabatic work processes, but
      is empirically feasible, and is in accord with experiments actually done,
      such as the Joule experiments mentioned just above, and with older
      traditions.
The formula (1) above allows that to go by processes of quasi-static adiabatic
work from the state     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A] to the state     B
{\displaystyle B}  [B] we can take a path that goes through the reference state
O   {\displaystyle O}  [O], since the quasi-static adiabatic work is
independent of the path
         &#x2212;  W  A &#x2192; B    a d i a b a t i c ,  q u a s i &#x2212; s
      t a t i c    = &#x2212;  W  A &#x2192; O    a d i a b a t i c ,  q u a s
      i &#x2212; s t a t i c    &#x2212;  W  O &#x2192; B    a d i a b a t i c
      ,  q u a s i &#x2212; s t a t i c    =  W  O &#x2192; A    a d i a b a t
      i c ,  q u a s i &#x2212; s t a t i c    &#x2212;  W  O &#x2192; B    a d
      i a b a t i c ,  q u a s i &#x2212; s t a t i c    = &#x2212; U ( A ) + U
      ( B ) = &#x0394; U   {\displaystyle -W_{A\to B}^{\mathrm
      {adiabatic,\,quasi-static} }=-W_{A\to O}^{\mathrm {adiabatic,\,quasi-
      static} }-W_{O\to B}^{\mathrm {adiabatic,\,quasi-static} }=W_{O\to A}^
      {\mathrm {adiabatic,\,quasi-static} }-W_{O\to B}^{\mathrm
      {adiabatic,\,quasi-static} }=-U(A)+U(B)=\Delta U}  [-W_{{A\to B}}^{
      {\mathrm  {adiabatic,\,quasi-static}}}=-W_{{A\to O}}^{{\mathrm
      {adiabatic,\,quasi-static}}}-W_{{O\to B}}^{{\mathrm  {adiabatic,\,quasi-
      static}}}=W_{{O\to A}}^{{\mathrm  {adiabatic,\,quasi-static}}}-W_{{O\to
      B}}^{{\mathrm  {adiabatic,\,quasi-static}}}=-U(A)+U(B)=\Delta U]
This kind of empirical evidence, coupled with theory of this kind, largely
justifies the following statement:
      For all adiabatic processes between two specified states of a closed
      system of any nature, the net work done is the same regardless the
      details of the process, and determines a state function called internal
      energy,     U   {\displaystyle U}  [U]."
**** Adynamic processes ****
See also: Thermodynamic_processes
A complementary observable aspect of the first law is about heat_transfer.
Adynamic transfer of energy as heat can be measured empirically by changes in
the surroundings of the system of interest by calorimetry. This again requires
the existence of adiabatic enclosure of the entire process, system and
surroundings, though the separating wall between the surroundings and the
system is thermally conductive or radiatively permeable, not adiabatic. A
calorimeter can rely on measurement of sensible_heat, which requires the
existence of thermometers and measurement of temperature change in bodies of
known sensible heat capacity under specified conditions; or it can rely on the
measurement of latent_heat, through measurement_of_masses_of_material_that
change_phase, at temperatures fixed by the occurrence of phase changes under
specified conditions in bodies of known latent heat of phase change. The
calorimeter can be calibrated by adiabatically doing externally determined work
on it. The most accurate method is by passing an electric current from outside
through a resistance inside the calorimeter. The calibration allows comparison
of calorimetric measurement of quantity of heat transferred with quantity of
energy transferred as work. According to one textbook, "The most common device
for measuring     &#x0394; U   {\displaystyle \Delta U}  [\Delta U] is an
adiabatic bomb calorimeter."[46] According to another textbook, "Calorimetry is
widely used in present day laboratories."[47] According to one opinion, "Most
thermodynamic data come from calorimetry..."[48] According to another opinion,
"The most common method of measuring "heat" is with a calorimeter."[49]
When the system evolves with transfer of energy as heat, without energy being
transferred as work, in an adynamic process,[50] the heat transferred to the
system is equal to the increase in its internal energy:
          Q  A &#x2192; B    a d y n a m i c    = &#x0394; U  .
      {\displaystyle Q_{A\to B}^{\mathrm {adynamic} }=\Delta U\,.}  [Q_{{A\to
      B}}^{{\mathrm  {adynamic}}}=\Delta U\,.]
**** General case for reversible processes ****
Heat transfer is practically reversible when it is driven by practically
negligibly small temperature gradients. Work transfer is practically reversible
when it occurs so slowly that there are no frictional effects within the
system; frictional effects outside the system should also be zero if the
process is to be globally reversible. For a particular reversible process in
general, the work done reversibly on the system,      W  A &#x2192; B    p a t
h    P  0   ,   r e v e r s i b l e      {\displaystyle W_{A\to B}^{\mathrm
{path} \,P_{0},\,\mathrm {reversible} }}  [W_{{A\to B}}^{{{\mathrm  {path}}\,P_
{0},\,{\mathrm  {reversible}}}}], and the heat transferred reversibly to the
system,      Q  A &#x2192; B    p a t h    P  0   ,   r e v e r s i b l e
{\displaystyle Q_{A\to B}^{\mathrm {path} \,P_{0},\,\mathrm {reversible} }}
[Q_{{A\to B}}^{{{\mathrm  {path}}\,P_{0},\,{\mathrm  {reversible}}}}] are not
required to occur respectively adiabatically or adynamically, but they must
belong to the same particular process defined by its particular reversible
path,      P  0     {\displaystyle P_{0}}  [P_{0}], through the space of
thermodynamic states. Then the work and heat transfers can occur and be
calculated simultaneously.
Putting the two complementary aspects together, the first law for a particular
reversible process can be written
         &#x2212;  W  A &#x2192; B    p a t h    P  0   ,   r e v e r s i b l e
      +  Q  A &#x2192; B    p a t h    P  0   ,   r e v e r s i b l e    =
      &#x0394; U  .   {\displaystyle -W_{A\to B}^{\mathrm {path} \,P_
      {0},\,\mathrm {reversible} }+Q_{A\to B}^{\mathrm {path} \,P_{0},\,\mathrm
      {reversible} }=\Delta U\,.}  [-W_{{A\to B}}^{{{\mathrm  {path}}\,P_{0},\,
      {\mathrm  {reversible}}}}+Q_{{A\to B}}^{{{\mathrm  {path}}\,P_{0},\,
      {\mathrm  {reversible}}}}=\Delta U\,.]
This combined statement is the expression the first law of thermodynamics for
reversible processes for closed systems.
In particular, if no work is done on a thermally isolated closed system we have
         &#x0394; U = 0    {\displaystyle \Delta U=0\,}  [\Delta U=0\,].
This is one aspect of the law of conservation of energy and can be stated:
      The internal energy of an isolated system remains constant.
**** General case for irreversible processes ****
If, in a process of change of state of a closed system, the energy transfer is
not under a practically zero temperature gradient and practically frictionless,
then the process is irreversible. Then the heat and work transfers may be
difficult to calculate, and irreversible thermodynamics is called for.
Nevertheless, the first law still holds and provides a check on the
measurements and calculations of the work done irreversibly on the system,
W  A &#x2192; B    p a t h    P  1   ,   i r r e v e r s i b l e
{\displaystyle W_{A\to B}^{\mathrm {path} \,P_{1},\,\mathrm {irreversible} }}
[W_{{A\to B}}^{{{\mathrm  {path}}\,P_{1},\,{\mathrm  {irreversible}}}}], and
the heat transferred irreversibly to the system,      Q  A &#x2192; B    p a t
h    P  1   ,   i r r e v e r s i b l e      {\displaystyle Q_{A\to B}^{\mathrm
{path} \,P_{1},\,\mathrm {irreversible} }}  [Q_{{A\to B}}^{{{\mathrm
{path}}\,P_{1},\,{\mathrm  {irreversible}}}}], which belong to the same
particular process defined by its particular irreversible path,      P  1
{\displaystyle P_{1}}  [P_{1}], through the space of thermodynamic states.
         &#x2212;  W  A &#x2192; B    p a t h    P  1   ,   i r r e v e r s i b
      l e    +  Q  A &#x2192; B    p a t h    P  1   ,   i r r e v e r s i b l
      e    = &#x0394; U  .   {\displaystyle -W_{A\to B}^{\mathrm {path} \,P_
      {1},\,\mathrm {irreversible} }+Q_{A\to B}^{\mathrm {path} \,P_
      {1},\,\mathrm {irreversible} }=\Delta U\,.}  [-W_{{A\to B}}^{{{\mathrm
      {path}}\,P_{1},\,{\mathrm  {irreversible}}}}+Q_{{A\to B}}^{{{\mathrm
      {path}}\,P_{1},\,{\mathrm  {irreversible}}}}=\Delta U\,.]
This means that the internal energy     U   {\displaystyle U}  [U] is a
function of state and that the internal energy change     &#x0394; U
{\displaystyle \Delta U}  [\Delta U] between two states is a function only of
the two states.
**** Overview of the weight of evidence for the law ****
The first law of thermodynamics is so general that its predictions cannot all
be directly tested. In many properly conducted experiments it has been
precisely supported, and never violated. Indeed, within its scope of
applicability, the law is so reliably established, that, nowadays, rather than
experiment being considered as testing the accuracy of the law, it is more
practical and realistic to think of the law as testing the accuracy of
experiment. An experimental result that seems to violate the law may be assumed
to be inaccurate or wrongly conceived, for example due to failure to account
for an important physical factor. Thus, some may regard it as a principle more
abstract than a law.
***** State functional formulation for infinitesimal processes *****
When the heat and work transfers in the equations above are infinitesimal in
magnitude, they are often denoted by Î´, rather than exact_differentials
denoted by d, as a reminder that heat and work do not describe the state of any
system. The integral of an inexact_differential depends upon the particular
path taken through the space of thermodynamic parameters while the integral of
an exact differential depends only upon the initial and final states. If the
initial and final states are the same, then the integral of an inexact
differential may or may not be zero, but the integral of an exact differential
is always zero. The path taken by a thermodynamic system through a chemical or
physical change is known as a thermodynamic_process.
The first law for a closed homogeneous system may be stated in terms that
include concepts that are established in the second law. The internal energy U
may then be expressed as a function of the system's defining state variables S,
entropy, and V, volume: U = U (S, V). In these terms, T, the system's
temperature, and P, its pressure, are partial derivatives of U with respect to
S and V. These variables are important throughout thermodynamics, though not
necessary for the statement of the first law. Rigorously, they are defined only
when the system is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. For
some purposes, the concepts provide good approximations for scenarios
sufficiently near to the system's internal thermodynamic equilibrium.
The first law requires that:
         d U = &#x03B4; Q &#x2212; &#x03B4; W                        (closed
      system, general process, quasi-static or irreversible).    {\displaystyle
      dU=\delta Q-\delta W\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{
      (closed system, general process, quasi-static or irreversible).}}}  [
      {\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-\delta
      W\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed system,
      general process, quasi-static or irreversible).}}}]
Then, for the fictive case of a reversible process, dU can be written in terms
of exact differentials. One may imagine reversible changes, such that there is
at each instant negligible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium within the
system. This excludes isochoric work. Then, mechanical work is given by Î´W = -
P dV and the quantity of heat added can be expressed as Î´Q = T dS. For these
conditions
         d U = T d S &#x2212; P d V                   (closed system,
      reversible process).    {\displaystyle dU=TdS-
      PdV\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed system, reversible
      process).}}}  [{\displaystyle dU=TdS-
      PdV\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed system, reversible
      process).}}}]
While this has been shown here for reversible changes, it is valid in general,
as U can be considered as a thermodynamic state function of the defining state
variables S and V:
         ( 2 )        d U = T d S &#x2212; P d V       (closed system, general
      process, quasi-static or irreversible).    {\displaystyle
      (2)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,dU=TdS-PdV\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed system, general
      process, quasi-static or irreversible).}}}  [{\displaystyle
      (2)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,dU=TdS-PdV\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(closed system, general
      process, quasi-static or irreversible).}}}]
Equation (2) is known as the fundamental_thermodynamic_relation for a closed
system in the energy representation, for which the defining state variables are
S and V, with respect to which T and P are partial derivatives of U.[51][52]
[53] It is only in the fictive reversible case, when isochoric work is
excluded, that the work done and heat transferred are given by âP dV and T
dS.
In the case of a closed system in which the particles of the system are of
different types and, because chemical reactions may occur, their respective
numbers are not necessarily constant, the fundamental thermodynamic relation
for dU becomes:
         d U = T d S &#x2212; P d V +  &#x2211;  i    &#x03BC;  i   d  N  i   .
      {\displaystyle dU=TdS-PdV+\sum _{i}\mu _{i}dN_{i}.\,}  [dU=TdS-PdV+\sum _
      {i}\mu _{i}dN_{i}.\,]
where dNi is the (small) increase in number of type-i particles in the
reaction, and Î¼i is known as the chemical_potential of the type-i particles in
the system. If dNi is expressed in mol then Î¼i is expressed in J/mol. If the
system has more external mechanical variables than just the volume that can
change, the fundamental thermodynamic relation further generalizes to:
         d U = T d S &#x2212;  &#x2211;  i    X  i   d  x  i   +  &#x2211;  j
      &#x03BC;  j   d  N  j   .    {\displaystyle dU=TdS-\sum _{i}X_{i}dx_
      {i}+\sum _{j}\mu _{j}dN_{j}.\,}  [dU=TdS-\sum _{{i}}X_{{i}}dx_{{i}}+\sum
      _{{j}}\mu _{{j}}dN_{{j}}.\,]
Here the Xi are the generalized_forces corresponding to the external variables
xi. The parameters Xi are independent of the size of the system and are called
intensive parameters and the xi are proportional to the size and called
extensive parameters.
For an open system, there can be transfers of particles as well as energy into
or out of the system during a process. For this case, the first law of
thermodynamics still holds, in the form that the internal energy is a function
of state and the change of internal energy in a process is a function only of
its initial and final states, as noted in the section below headed First_law_of
thermodynamics_for_open_systems.
A useful idea from mechanics is that the energy gained by a particle is equal
to the force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the
particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the
heating term: dU = -PdV. The pressure P can be viewed as a force (and in fact
has units of force per unit area) while dVis the displacement (with units of
distance times area). We may say, with respect to this work term, that a
pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the
two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of
the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work
done on the system.
It is useful to view the TdS term in the same light: here the temperature is
known as a "generalized" force (rather than an actual mechanical force) and the
entropy is a generalized displacement.
Similarly, a difference in chemical potential between groups of particles in
the system drives a chemical reaction that changes the numbers of particles,
and the corresponding product is the amount of chemical potential energy
transformed in process. For example, consider a system consisting of two
phases: liquid water and water vapor. There is a generalized "force" of
evaporation that drives water molecules out of the liquid. There is a
generalized "force" of condensation that drives vapor molecules out of the
vapor. Only when these two "forces" (or chemical potentials) are equal is there
equilibrium, and the net rate of transfer zero.
The two thermodynamic parameters that form a generalized force-displacement
pair are called "conjugate variables". The two most familiar pairs are, of
course, pressure-volume, and temperature-entropy.
***** Spatially inhomogeneous systems *****
Classical thermodynamics is initially focused on closed homogeneous systems
(e.g. Planck 1897/1903[37]), which might be regarded as 'zero-dimensional' in
the sense that they have no spatial variation. But it is desired to study also
systems with distinct internal motion and spatial inhomogeneity. For such
systems, the principle of conservation of energy is expressed in terms not only
of internal energy as defined for homogeneous systems, but also in terms of
kinetic energy and potential energies of parts of the inhomogeneous system with
respect to each other and with respect to long-range external forces.[54] How
the total energy of a system is allocated between these three more specific
kinds of energy varies according to the purposes of different writers; this is
because these components of energy are to some extent mathematical artefacts
rather than actually measured physical quantities. For any closed homogeneous
component of an inhomogeneous closed system, if     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E]
denotes the total energy of that component system, one may write
         E =  E   k i n    +  E   p o t    + U   {\displaystyle E=E^{\mathrm
      {kin} }+E^{\mathrm {pot} }+U}  [E=E^{{{\mathrm  {kin}}}}+E^{{{\mathrm
      {pot}}}}+U]
where      E   k i n      {\displaystyle E^{\mathrm {kin} }}  [E^{{{\mathrm
{kin}}}}] and      E   p o t      {\displaystyle E^{\mathrm {pot} }}  [E^{{
{\mathrm  {pot}}}}] denote respectively the total kinetic energy and the total
potential energy of the component closed homogeneous system, and     U
{\displaystyle U}  [U] denotes its internal energy.[26][55]
Potential energy can be exchanged with the surroundings of the system when the
surroundings impose a force field, such as gravitational or electromagnetic, on
the system.
A compound system consisting of two interacting closed homogeneous component
subsystems has a potential energy of interaction      E  12    p o t
{\displaystyle E_{12}^{\mathrm {pot} }}  [E_{{12}}^{{{\mathrm  {pot}}}}]
between the subsystems. Thus, in an obvious notation, one may write
         E =  E  1    k i n    +  E  1    p o t    +  U  1   +  E  2    k i n
      +  E  2    p o t    +  U  2   +  E  12    p o t      {\displaystyle E=E_
      {1}^{\mathrm {kin} }+E_{1}^{\mathrm {pot} }+U_{1}+E_{2}^{\mathrm {kin}
      }+E_{2}^{\mathrm {pot} }+U_{2}+E_{12}^{\mathrm {pot} }}  [E=E_{1}^{{
      {\mathrm  {kin}}}}+E_{1}^{{{\mathrm  {pot}}}}+U_{1}+E_{2}^{{{\mathrm
      {kin}}}}+E_{2}^{{{\mathrm  {pot}}}}+U_{2}+E_{{12}}^{{{\mathrm  {pot}}}}]
The quantity      E  12    p o t      {\displaystyle E_{12}^{\mathrm {pot} }}
[E_{{12}}^{{{\mathrm  {pot}}}}] in general lacks an assignment to either
subsystem in a way that is not arbitrary, and this stands in the way of a
general non-arbitrary definition of transfer of energy as work. On occasions,
authors make their various respective arbitrary assignments.[56]
The distinction between internal and kinetic energy is hard to make in the
presence of turbulent motion within the system, as friction gradually
dissipates macroscopic kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into molecular
random motion of molecules that is classified as internal energy.[57] The rate
of dissipation by friction of kinetic energy of localised bulk flow into
internal energy,[58][59][60] whether in turbulent or in streamlined flow, is an
important quantity in non-equilibrium_thermodynamics. This is a serious
difficulty for attempts to define entropy for time-varying spatially
inhomogeneous systems.
***** First law of thermodynamics for open systems *****
For the first law of thermodynamics, there is no trivial passage of physical
conception from the closed system view to an open system view.[61][62] For
closed systems, the concepts of an adiabatic enclosure and of an adiabatic wall
are fundamental. Matter and internal energy cannot permeate or penetrate such a
wall. For an open system, there is a wall that allows penetration by matter. In
general, matter in diffusive motion carries with it some internal energy, and
some microscopic potential energy changes accompany the motion. An open system
is not adiabatically enclosed.
There are some cases in which a process for an open system can, for particular
purposes, be considered as if it were for a closed system. In an open system,
by definition hypothetically or potentially, matter can pass between the system
and its surroundings. But when, in a particular case, the process of interest
involves only hypothetical or potential but no actual passage of matter, the
process can be considered as if it were for a closed system.
**** Internal energy for an open system ****
Since the revised and more rigorous definition of the internal energy of a
closed system rests upon the possibility of processes by which adiabatic work
takes the system from one state to another, this leaves a problem for the
definition of internal energy for an open system, for which adiabatic work is
not in general possible. According to Max_Born, the transfer of matter and
energy across an open connection "cannot be reduced to mechanics".[63] In
contrast to the case of closed systems, for open systems, in the presence of
diffusion, there is no unconstrained and unconditional physical distinction
between convective transfer of internal energy by bulk flow of matter, the
transfer of internal energy without transfer of matter (usually called heat
conduction and work transfer), and change of various potential energies.[64]
[65][66] The older traditional way and the conceptually revised (CarathÃ©odory)
way agree that there is no physically unique definition of heat and work
transfer processes between open systems.[67][68][69][70][71][72]
In particular, between two otherwise isolated open systems an adiabatic wall is
by definition impossible.[73] This problem is solved by recourse to the
principle of conservation_of_energy. This principle allows a composite isolated
system to be derived from two other component non-interacting isolated systems,
in such a way that the total energy of the composite isolated system is equal
to the sum of the total energies of the two component isolated systems. Two
previously isolated systems can be subjected to the thermodynamic_operation of
placement between them of a wall permeable to matter and energy, followed by a
time for establishment of a new thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium in
the new single unpartitioned system.[74] The internal energies of the initial
two systems and of the final new system, considered respectively as closed
systems as above, can be measured.[61] Then the law of conservation of energy
requires that
         &#x0394;  U  s   + &#x0394;  U  o   = 0  ,   {\displaystyle \Delta U_
      {s}+\Delta U_{o}=0\,,}  [\Delta U_{s}+\Delta U_{o}=0\,,][75][76]
where ÎUs and ÎUo denote the changes in internal energy of the system and of
its surroundings respectively. This is a statement of the first law of
thermodynamics for a transfer between two otherwise isolated open systems,[77]
that fits well with the conceptually revised and rigorous statement of the law
stated above.
For the thermodynamic operation of adding two systems with internal energies U1
and U2, to produce a new system with internal energy U, one may write U = U1 +
U2; the reference states for U, U1 and U2 should be specified accordingly,
maintaining also that the internal energy of a system be proportional to its
mass, so that the internal energies are extensive_variables.[61][78]
There is a sense in which this kind of additivity expresses a fundamental
postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system
thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs
explicit expression; indeed one author goes so far as to say that it could be
recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by
other authors.[79][80]
Also of course
         &#x0394;  N  s   + &#x0394;  N  o   = 0  ,   {\displaystyle \Delta N_
      {s}+\Delta N_{o}=0\,,}  [\Delta N_{s}+\Delta N_{o}=0\,,][75][76]
where ÎNs and ÎNo denote the changes in mole number of a component substance
of the system and of its surroundings respectively. This is a statement of the
law of conservation_of_mass.
**** Process of transfer of matter between an open system and its surroundings
****
A system connected to its surroundings only through contact by a single
permeable wall, but otherwise isolated, is an open system. If it is initially
in a state of contact equilibrium with a surrounding subsystem, a thermodynamic
process of transfer of matter can be made to occur between them if the
surrounding subsystem is subjected to some thermodynamic operation, for
example, removal of a partition between it and some further surrounding
subsystem. The removal of the partition in the surroundings initiates a process
of exchange between the system and its contiguous surrounding subsystem.
An example is evaporation. One may consider an open system consisting of a
collection of liquid, enclosed except where it is allowed to evaporate into or
to receive condensate from its vapor above it, which may be considered as its
contiguous surrounding subsystem, and subject to control of its volume and
temperature.
A thermodynamic process might be initiated by a thermodynamic operation in the
surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the
vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor,
but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor
collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy
will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, but it will not make sense to
try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as
work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter
between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into
heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total
energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding
subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of
the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict
compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In
this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to
long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The
first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open
system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.
**** Open system with multiple contacts ****
An open system can be in contact equilibrium with several other systems at
once.[17][81][82][83][84][85][86][87]
This includes cases in which there is contact equilibrium between the system,
and several subsystems in its surroundings, including separate connections with
subsystems through walls that are permeable to the transfer of matter and
internal energy as heat and allowing friction of passage of the transferred
matter, but immovable, and separate connections through adiabatic walls with
others, and separate connections through diathermic walls impermeable to matter
with yet others. Because there are physically separate connections that are
permeable to energy but impermeable to matter, between the system and its
surroundings, energy transfers between them can occur with definite heat and
work characters. Conceptually essential here is that the internal energy
transferred with the transfer of matter is measured by a variable that is
mathematically independent of the variables that measure heat and work.[88]
With such independence of variables, the total increase of internal energy in
the process is then determined as the sum of the internal energy transferred
from the surroundings with the transfer of matter through the walls that are
permeable to it, and of the internal energy transferred to the system as heat
through the diathermic walls, and of the energy transferred to the system as
work through the adiabatic walls, including the energy transferred to the
system by long-range forces. These simultaneously transferred quantities of
energy are defined by events in the surroundings of the system. Because the
internal energy transferred with matter is not in general uniquely resolvable
into heat and work components, the total energy transfer cannot in general be
uniquely resolved into heat and work components.[89] Under these conditions,
the following formula can describe the process in terms of externally defined
thermodynamic variables, as a statement of the first law of thermodynamics:
         ( 3 )        &#x0394;  U  0    =  Q  &#x2212;  W  &#x2212;   &#x2211;
      i = 1   m   &#x0394;  U  i         (suitably defined surrounding
      subsystems, general process, quasi-static or irreversible),
      {\displaystyle (3)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\Delta U_{0}\,=\,Q\,-\,W\,-\,\sum _{i=1}^
      {m}\Delta U_{i}\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(suitably defined surrounding subsystems,
      general process, quasi-static or irreversible),}}}  [{\displaystyle
      (3)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\Delta U_{0}\,=\,Q\,-\,W\,-\,\sum _{i=1}^{m}\Delta U_
      {i}\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(suitably defined surrounding subsystems, general
      process, quasi-static or irreversible),}}}]
where ÎU0 denotes the change of internal energy of the system, and ÎUi
denotes the change of internal energy of the ith of the m surrounding
subsystems that are in open contact with the system, due to transfer between
the system and that ith surrounding subsystem, and Q denotes the internal
energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoir of the surroundings to the
system, and W denotes the energy transferred from the system to the surrounding
subsystems that are in adiabatic connection with it. The case of a wall that is
permeable to matter and can move so as to allow transfer of energy as work is
not considered here.
*** Combination of first and second laws ***
If the system is described by the energetic fundamental equation, U0 = U0(S, V,
Nj), and if the process can be described in the quasi-static formalism, in
terms of the internal state variables of the system, then the process can also
be described by a combination of the first and second laws of thermodynamics,
by the formula
         ( 4 )         d   U  0    =  T   d  S  &#x2212;  P   d  V  +
      &#x2211;  j = 1   n    &#x03BC;  j     d   N  j     {\displaystyle
      (4)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm {d} U_{0}\,=\,T\,\mathrm {d} S\,-\,P\,\mathrm
      {d} V\,+\,\sum _{j=1}^{n}\mu _{j}\,\mathrm {d} N_{j}}  [{\displaystyle
      (4)\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm {d} U_{0}\,=\,T\,\mathrm {d} S\,-\,P\,\mathrm
      {d} V\,+\,\sum _{j=1}^{n}\mu _{j}\,\mathrm {d} N_{j}}]
where there are n chemical constituents of the system and permeably connected
surrounding subsystems, and where T, S, P, V, Nj, and Î¼j, are defined as
above.[90]
For a general natural process, there is no immediate term-wise correspondence
between equations (3) and (4), because they describe the process in different
conceptual frames.
Nevertheless, a conditional correspondence exists. There are three relevant
kinds of wall here: purely diathermal, adiabatic, and permeable to matter. If
two of those kinds of wall are sealed off, leaving only one that permits
transfers of energy, as work, as heat, or with matter, then the remaining
permitted terms correspond precisely. If two of the kinds of wall are left
unsealed, then energy transfer can be shared between them, so that the two
remaining permitted terms do not correspond precisely.
For the special fictive case of quasi-static transfers, there is a simple
correspondence.[91] For this, it is supposed that the system has multiple areas
of contact with its surroundings. There are pistons that allow adiabatic work,
purely diathermal walls, and open connections with surrounding subsystems of
completely controllable chemical potential (or equivalent controls for charged
species). Then, for a suitable fictive quasi-static transfer, one can write
         &#x03B4; Q  =  T   d  S   &#xA0;and&#xA0;  &#x03B4; W  =  P   d  V
      (suitably defined surrounding subsystems, quasi-static transfers of
      energy)  .   {\displaystyle \delta Q\,=\,T\,\mathrm {d} S\,{\text{ and
      }}\delta W\,=\,P\,\mathrm {d} V\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(suitably defined
      surrounding subsystems, quasi-static transfers of energy)}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle \delta Q\,=\,T\,\mathrm {d} S\,{\text{   and    }}\delta
      W\,=\,P\,\mathrm {d} V\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{(suitably defined surrounding
      subsystems, quasi-static transfers of energy)}}.}]
For fictive quasi-static transfers for which the chemical potentials in the
connected surrounding subsystems are suitably controlled, these can be put into
equation (4) to yield
         ( 5 )         d   U  0    =  &#x03B4; Q  &#x2212;  &#x03B4; W  +
      &#x2211;  j = 1   n    &#x03BC;  j     d   N  j           (suitably
      defined surrounding subsystems, quasi-static transfers)  .

The reference [91] does not actually write equation (5), but what it does write
is fully compatible with it. Another helpful account is given by Tschoegl.[92]
There are several other accounts of this, in apparent mutual conflict.[70][93]
[94]
**** Non-equilibrium transfers ****
The transfer of energy between an open system and a single contiguous subsystem
of its surroundings is considered also in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The
problem of definition arises also in this case. It may be allowed that the wall
between the system and the subsystem is not only permeable to matter and to
internal energy, but also may be movable so as to allow work to be done when
the two systems have different pressures. In this case, the transfer of energy
as heat is not defined.
Methods for study of non-equilibrium processes mostly deal with spatially
continuous flow systems. In this case, the open connection between system and
surroundings is usually taken to fully surround the system, so that there are
no separate connections impermeable to matter but permeable to heat. Except for
the special case mentioned above when there is no actual transfer of matter,
which can be treated as if for a closed system, in strictly defined
thermodynamic terms, it follows that transfer of energy as heat is not defined.
In this sense, there is no such thing as 'heat flow' for a continuous-flow open
system. Properly, for closed systems, one speaks of transfer of internal energy
as heat, but in general, for open systems, one can speak safely only of
transfer of internal energy. A factor here is that there are often cross-
effects between distinct transfers, for example that transfer of one substance
may cause transfer of another even when the latter has zero chemical potential
gradient.
Usually transfer between a system and its surroundings applies to transfer of a
state variable, and obeys a balance law, that the amount lost by the donor
system is equal to the amount gained by the receptor system. Heat is not a
state variable. For his 1947 definition of "heat transfer" for discrete open
systems, the author Prigogine carefully explains at some length that his
definition of it does not obey a balance law. He describes this as paradoxical.
[95]
The situation is clarified by Gyarmati, who shows that his definition of "heat
transfer", for continuous-flow systems, really refers not specifically to heat,
but rather to transfer of internal energy, as follows. He considers a
conceptual small cell in a situation of continuous-flow as a system defined in
the so-called Lagrangian way, moving with the local center of mass. The flow of
matter across the boundary is zero when considered as a flow of total mass.
Nevertheless, if the material constitution is of several chemically distinct
components that can diffuse with respect to one another, the system is
considered to be open, the diffusive flows of the components being defined with
respect to the center of mass of the system, and balancing one another as to
mass transfer. Still there can be a distinction between bulk flow of internal
energy and diffusive flow of internal energy in this case, because the internal
energy density does not have to be constant per unit mass of material, and
allowing for non-conservation of internal energy because of local conversion of
kinetic energy of bulk flow to internal energy by viscosity.
Gyarmati shows that his definition of "the heat flow vector" is strictly
speaking a definition of flow of internal energy, not specifically of heat, and
so it turns out that his use here of the word heat is contrary to the strict
thermodynamic definition of heat, though it is more or less compatible with
historical custom, that often enough did not clearly distinguish between heat
and internal energy; he writes "that this relation must be considered to be the
exact definition of the concept of heat flow, fairly loosely used in
experimental physics and heat technics."[96] Apparently in a different frame of
thinking from that of the above-mentioned paradoxical usage in the earlier
sections of the historic 1947 work by Prigogine, about discrete systems, this
usage of Gyarmati is consistent with the later sections of the same 1947 work
by Prigogine, about continuous-flow systems, which use the term "heat flux" in
just this way. This usage is also followed by Glansdorff and Prigogine in their
1971 text about continuous-flow systems. They write: "Again the flow of
internal energy may be split into a convection flow Ïuv and a conduction flow.
This conduction flow is by definition the heat flow W. Therefore: j[U] = Ïuv +
W where u denotes the [internal] energy per unit mass. [These authors actually
use the symbols E and e to denote internal energy but their notation has been
changed here to accord with the notation of the present article. These authors
actually use the symbol U to refer to total energy, including kinetic energy of
bulk flow.]"[97] This usage is followed also by other writers on non-
equilibrium thermodynamics such as Lebon, Jou, and Casas-VÃ¡squez,[98] and de
Groot and Mazur.[99] This usage is described by Bailyn as stating the non-
convective flow of internal energy, and is listed as his definition number 1,
according to the first law of thermodynamics.[71] This usage is also followed
by workers in the kinetic theory of gases.[100][101][102] This is not the ad
hoc definition of "reduced heat flux" of Haase.[103]
In the case of a flowing system of only one chemical constituent, in the
Lagrangian representation, there is no distinction between bulk flow and
diffusion of matter. Moreover, the flow of matter is zero into or out of the
cell that moves with the local center of mass. In effect, in this description,
one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the transfer of matter. But
still one can validly talk of a distinction between bulk flow and diffusive
flow of internal energy, the latter driven by a temperature gradient within the
flowing material, and being defined with respect to the local center of mass of
the bulk flow. In this case of a virtually closed system, because of the zero
matter transfer, as noted above, one can safely distinguish between transfer of
energy as work, and transfer of internal energy as heat.[104]
