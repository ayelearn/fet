Enthalpy /ËÉnÎ¸Élpi/ ([About_this_sound]listen), a property of a
thermodynamic_system, is equal to the system's internal_energy plus the product
of its pressure and volume.[1][2] In a system enclosed so as to prevent matter
transfer, for processes at constant pressure, the heat absorbed or released
equals the change in enthalpy.
The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the International_System_of_Units (SI)
is the joule. Other historical conventional units still in use include the
British_thermal_unit_(BTU) and the calorie.
Enthalpy comprises a system's internal_energy, which is the energy required to
create the system, plus the amount of work required to make room for it by
displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure.[3]
Enthalpy is defined as a state_function that depends only on the prevailing
equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy, pressure, and
volume. It is an extensive quantity.
Enthalpy(ÎH) is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many
chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because
it simplifies the description of energy_transfer. In a system enclosed so as to
prevent matter transfer, at constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the
energy transferred from the environment through heat transfer or work other
than expansion work.
The total enthalpy, H, of a system cannot be measured directly. The same
situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy
carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in
order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference
point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, ÎH. The ÎH is a
positive change in endothermic reactions, and negative in heat-releasing
exothermic processes.
For processes under constant pressure, ÎH is equal to the change in the
internal energy of the system, plus the pressure-volume_work p ÎV done by the
system on its surroundings (which is > 0 for an expansion and < 0 for a
contraction).[4] This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions
is the heat absorbed or released by the system through a chemical reaction or
by external heat transfer. Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant
pressure usually refer to standard_state: most commonly 1 bar pressure.
Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see standard
state), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of
formation at 25 Â°C.
Enthalpy of ideal_gases and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend
on pressure, unlike entropy and Gibbs_energy. Real materials at common
temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which
greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and
analyses.

***** History[edit] *****
The word enthalpy was coined relatively late, in the early 20th century, in
analogy with the 19th-century terms energy (introduced in its modern sense by
Thomas_Young in 1802) and entropy (coined in analogy to energy by Rudolf
Clausius in 1865). Where energy uses the root of the Greek word á¼ÏÎ³Î¿Î½
(ergon) "work" to express the idea of "work-content" and where entropy uses the
Greek word ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ® (tropi) "transformation" to express the idea of
"transformation-content", so by analogy, enthalpy uses the root of the Greek
word Î¸Î¬Î»ÏÎ¿Ï (thalpos) "warmth, heat"[5] to express the idea of "heat-
content". The term does in fact stand in for the older term "heat content",[6]
a term which is now mostly deprecated as misleading, as dH refers to the amount
of heat absorbed in a process at constant pressure only,[7] but not in the
general case (when pressure is variable).[8] Josiah_Willard_Gibbs used the term
"a heat function for constant pressure" for clarity.[note_1]
Introduction of the concept of "heat content" H is associated with BenoÃ®t_Paul
Ãmile_Clapeyron and Rudolf_Clausius (ClausiusâClapeyron_relation, 1850).
The term enthalpy first appeared in print in 1909.[9] It is attributed to Heike
Kamerlingh_Onnes, who most likely introduced it orally the year before, at the
first meeting of the Institute of Refrigeration in Paris.[10] It gained
currency only in the 1920s, notably with the Mollier_Steam_Tables_and_Diagrams,
published in 1927.
Until the 1920s, the symbol H was used, somewhat inconsistently, for "heat" in
general. The definition of H as strictly limited to enthalpy or "heat content
at constant pressure" was formally proposed by Alfred W. Porter in 1922.[11]
[12]
***** Formal definition[edit] *****
The enthalpy of a thermodynamic system is defined as[13][14]
               H = U + p V ,   {\displaystyle H=U+pV,}  [{\displaystyle
            H=U+pV,}]
      where
                *    H   {\displaystyle H}  [H] is enthalpy
                *    U   {\displaystyle U}  [U] is the internal_energy of the
                  system
                *    p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] is pressure
                *    V   {\displaystyle V}  [V] is the volume of the system
Enthalpy is an extensive_property. This means that, for homogeneous systems,
the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to
introduce the specific_enthalpy     h =   H m     {\displaystyle h={\frac {H}
{m}}}  [{\displaystyle h={\frac {H}{m}}}], where     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m]
is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy      H   m    =   H n
{\displaystyle H_{\mathrm {m} }={\frac {H}{n}}}  [{\displaystyle H_{\mathrm {m}
}={\frac {H}{n}}}], where     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] is the number of moles
(    h   {\displaystyle h}  [h] and      H   m      {\displaystyle H_{\mathrm
{m} }}  [{\displaystyle H_{\mathrm {m} }}] are intensive_properties). For
inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the
composing subsystems:
               H =  &#x2211;  k    H  k   ,   {\displaystyle H=\sum _{k}H_{k},}
            [{\displaystyle H=\sum _{k}H_{k},}]
      where
                *    H   {\displaystyle H}  [H] is the total enthalpy of all
                  the subsystems
                *    k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] refers to the various
                  subsystems
                *     H  k     {\displaystyle H_{k}}  [H_{k}] refers to the
                  enthalpy of each subsystem
                *     &#x2211;  k    H  k     {\displaystyle \sum _{k}H_{k}}  [
                  {\displaystyle \sum _{k}H_{k}}] refers to the sum of the
                  enthalpies of all subsystems
A closed system may lie in thermodynamic equilibrium in a static gravitational
field, so that its pressure,     p   {\displaystyle p}  [p], varies
continuously with altitude, while, because of the equilibrium requirement, its
temperature     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] is invariant with altitude.
(Correspondingly, the system's gravitational potential energy density also
varies with altitude.) Then the enthalpy summation becomes an integral:
               H = &#x222B; ( &#x03C1; h )  d V ,   {\displaystyle H=\int (\rho
            h)\,dV,}  [{\displaystyle H=\int (\rho h)\,dV,}]
      where
                *    &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] ("rho") is
                  density (mass per unit volume)
                *    h   {\displaystyle h}  [h] is the specific enthalpy
                  (enthalpy per unit mass)
                *    ( &#x03C1; h )   {\displaystyle (\rho h)}  [{\displaystyle
                  (\rho h)}] represents the enthalpy_density (enthalpy per unit
                  volume)
                *    d V   {\displaystyle dV}  [dV] denotes an infinitesimally
                  small element of volume within the system, for example the
                  volume of an infinitesimally thin horizontal layer
                *    &#x222B; ( &#x03C1; h )  d V ,   {\displaystyle \int (\rho
                  h)\,dV,}  [{\displaystyle \int (\rho h)\,dV,}] represents the
                  sum of the enthalpies of all the elements of the volume.
The enthalpy of a closed homogeneous system is its cardinal_energy_function,
H ( S , p )   {\displaystyle H(S,p)}  [{\displaystyle H(S,p)}], with natural
state variables its entropy     S [ p ]   {\displaystyle S[p]}  [{\displaystyle
S[p]}] and its pressure     p   {\displaystyle p}  [p]. A differential relation
for it can be derived as follows. We start from the first_law_of_thermodynamics
for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:
               d U = &#x03B4; Q &#x2212; &#x03B4; W .   {\displaystyle
            dU=\delta Q-\delta W.}  [{\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-\delta W.}]
      where
                *    &#x03B4; Q   {\displaystyle \delta Q}  [\delta Q] is a
                  small amount of heat added to the system
                *    &#x03B4; W   {\displaystyle \delta W}  [\delta W] a small
                  amount of work performed by the system.
In a homogeneous system in which only reversible, or quasi-static, processes
are considered, the second_law_of_thermodynamics gives     &#x03B4; Q = T
&#xA0; d S   {\displaystyle \delta Q=T\ dS}  [{\displaystyle \delta Q=T\ dS}]
with     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] the absolute_temperature of the system.
Furthermore, if only     p V   {\displaystyle pV}  [pV] work is done,
&#x03B4; W = p &#xA0; d V   {\displaystyle \delta W=p\ dV}  [{\displaystyle
\delta W=p\ dV}]. As a result,
               d U = T  d S &#x2212; p  d V .   {\displaystyle dU=T\,dS-p\,dV.}
            [{\displaystyle dU=T\,dS-p\,dV.}]
Adding     d ( p V )   {\displaystyle d(pV)}  [{\displaystyle d(pV)}] to both
sides of this expression gives
               d U + d ( p V ) = T  d S &#x2212; p  d V + d ( p V ) ,
            {\displaystyle dU+d(pV)=T\,dS-p\,dV+d(pV),}  [{\displaystyle dU+d
            (pV)=T\,dS-p\,dV+d(pV),}]
      or
               d ( U + p V ) = T  d S + V  d p .   {\displaystyle d
            (U+pV)=T\,dS+V\,dp.}  [{\displaystyle d(U+pV)=T\,dS+V\,dp.}]
So
               d H ( S , p ) = T  d S + V  d p .   {\displaystyle dH
            (S,p)=T\,dS+V\,dp.}  [{\displaystyle dH(S,p)=T\,dS+V\,dp.}]
***** Other expressions[edit] *****
The above expression of dH in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar
to some readers. However, there are expressions in terms of more familiar
variables such as temperature and pressure:[13]:88[15]
         d H =  C  p    d T + V ( 1 &#x2212; &#x03B1; T )  d p .
      {\displaystyle dH=C_{p}\,dT+V(1-\alpha T)\,dp.}  [{\displaystyle dH=C_
      {p}\,dT+V(1-\alpha T)\,dp.}]
Here Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure and Î± is the coefficient of
(cubic) thermal expansion:
         &#x03B1; =   1 V     (    &#x2202; V   &#x2202; T    )   p   .
      {\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial
      T}}\right)_{p}.}  [{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac
      {\partial V}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}.}]
With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if Cp and V
are known as functions of p and T.
Note that for an ideal_gas, Î±T = 1,[note_2] so that
         d H =  C  p    d T .   {\displaystyle dH=C_{p}\,dT.}  [{\displaystyle
      dH=C_{p}\,dT.}]
In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with
additional terms involving the chemical_potential and the number of particles
of various types. The differential statement for dH then becomes
         d H = T  d S + V  d p +  &#x2211;  i    &#x03BC;  i    d  N  i   ,
      {\displaystyle dH=T\,dS+V\,dp+\sum _{i}\mu _{i}\,dN_{i},}  [
      {\displaystyle dH=T\,dS+V\,dp+\sum _{i}\mu _{i}\,dN_{i},}]
where Î¼i is the chemical potential per particle for an i-type particle, and Ni
is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as Î¼i dni
(with dni the number of moles of component i added to the system and, in this
case, Î¼i the molar chemical potential) or as Î¼i dmi (with dmi the mass of
component i added to the system and, in this case, Î¼i the specific chemical
potential).
**** Cardinal functions[edit] ****
The enthalpy, H(S[p],p,{Ni}), expresses the thermodynamics of a system in the
energy-language, or in the energy representation. As a function_of_state, its
arguments include both one intensive and several extensive state_variables. The
state variables S[p], p, and {Ni} are said to be the natural state variables in
this representation. They are suitable for describing processes in which they
are experimentally controlled. For example, in an idealized process, S[p] and p
can be controlled by preventing heat and matter transfer by enclosing the
system with a wall that is adiathermal and impermeable to matter, and by making
the process infinitely slow, and by varying only the external pressure on the
piston that controls the volume of the system. This is the basis of the so-
called adiabatic approximation that is used in meteorology.[16]
Alongside the enthalpy, with these arguments, the other cardinal function of
state of a thermodynamic system is its entropy, as a function, S[p](H,p,{Ni}),
of the same list of variables of state, except that the entropy, S[p], is
replaced in the list by the enthalpy, H. It expresses the entropy
representation. The state variables H, p, and {Ni} are said to be the natural
state variables in this representation. They are suitable for describing
processes in which they are experimentally controlled. For example, H and p can
be controlled by allowing heat transfer, and by varying only the external
pressure on the piston that sets the volume of the system.[17][18][19]
***** Physical interpretation[edit] *****
The U term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and
the pV term as the work that would be required to "make room" for the system if
the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example,
n moles of a gas of volume V at pressure p and temperature T, is created or
brought to its present state from absolute_zero, energy must be supplied equal
to its internal energy U plus pV, where pV is the work done in pushing against
the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.
In basic physics and statistical_mechanics it may be more interesting to study
the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is
used.[20][21] In basic chemistry, experiments are often conducted at constant
atmospheric_pressure, and the pressure-volume work represents an energy
exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that ÎH
is the expression chosen for the heat_of_reaction.
For a heat_engine a change in its internal energy is the difference between the
heat input and the pressure-volume_work done by the working substance while a
change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work
done by the engine:[22]
         d H = &#x03B4; Q &#x2212; &#x03B4; W   {\displaystyle dH=\delta Q-
      \delta W}  [{\displaystyle dH=\delta Q-\delta W}]
where the work W done by the engine is:
         W = &#x2212;    &#x222E;      &#x2061; p d V   {\displaystyle W=-\oint
      pdV}  [{\displaystyle W=-\oint pdV}]
***** Relationship to heat[edit] *****
In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply,
we return to the first law for closed systems, with the physics sign
convention: dU = Î´Q â Î´W, where the heat Î´Q is supplied by conduction,
radiation, and Joule_heating. We apply it to the special case with a constant
pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two
contributions, the so-called pV work, given by p dV (where here p is the
pressure at the surface, dV is the increase of the volume of the system), and
the so-called isochoric mechanical work Î´Wâ², such as stirring by a shaft
with paddles or by an externally driven magnetic field acting on an internal
rotor. Cases of long range electromagnetic interaction require further state
variables in their formulation, and are not considered here. So we write Î´W =
p dV + Î´Wâ². In this case the first law reads:
         d U = &#x03B4; Q &#x2212; p  d V &#x2212; &#x03B4;  W &#x2032;  .
      {\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-p\,dV-\delta W'.}  [{\displaystyle dU=\delta
      Q-p\,dV-\delta W'.}]
Now,
         d H = d U + d ( p V ) .   {\displaystyle dH=dU+d(pV).}  [
      {\displaystyle dH=dU+d(pV).}]
So
         d H = &#x03B4; Q + V  d p + p  d V &#x2212; p  d V &#x2212; &#x03B4;
      W &#x2032;    {\displaystyle dH=\delta Q+V\,dp+p\,dV-p\,dV-\delta W'}  [
      {\displaystyle dH=\delta Q+V\,dp+p\,dV-p\,dV-\delta W'}]
                 = &#x03B4; Q + V  d p &#x2212; &#x03B4;  W &#x2032;  .
            {\displaystyle \,\,=\delta Q+V\,dp-\delta W'.}  [{\displaystyle
            \,\,=\delta Q+V\,dp-\delta W'.}]
With sign convention of physics, Î´W' < 0, because isochoric shaft work done by
an external device on the system adds energy to the system, and may be viewed
as virtually adding heat. The only thermodynamic mechanical work done by the
system is expansion work, p dV.[23]
The system is under constant_pressure (dp = 0). Consequently, the increase in
enthalpy of the system is equal to the added heat and virtual heat:
         d H = &#x03B4; Q &#x2212; &#x03B4;  W &#x2032;  .   {\displaystyle
      dH=\delta Q-\delta W'.}  [{\displaystyle dH=\delta Q-\delta W'.}]
This is why the now obsolete term heat content was used in the nineteenth
century.
***** Applications[edit] *****
In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements
for creating a system from "nothingness"; the mechanical work required, pV,
differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the
thermodynamic_system.
Energy must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space
for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure p remains constant;
this is the pV term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in
internal energy, U, which includes activation_energies, ionization energies,
mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth.
Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy U + pV. For systems at
constant pressure, with no external work done other than the pV work, the
change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.
For a simple system, with a constant number of particles, the difference in
enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic
process in which the pressure is held constant.[24]
**** Heat of reaction[edit] ****
Main article: Standard_enthalpy_of_reaction
The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly, the enthalpy change
of a system is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following
equation:
         &#x0394; H =  H   f    &#x2212;  H   i    ,   {\displaystyle \Delta
      H=H_{\mathrm {f} }-H_{\mathrm {i} },}  [{\displaystyle \Delta H=H_
      {\mathrm {f} }-H_{\mathrm {i} },}]
where
      ÎH is the "enthalpy change",
      Hf is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the
      enthalpy of the products),
      Hi is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the
      enthalpy of the reactants).
For an exothermic_reaction at constant pressure, the system's change in
enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction, including the energy
retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings. In
a similar manner, for an endothermic reaction, the system's change in enthalpy
is equal to the energy absorbed in the reaction, including the energy lost by
the system and gained from compression from its surroundings. If ÎH is
positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system
due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the
reactants. On the other hand, if ÎH is negative, the reaction is exothermic,
that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.
[25]
From the definition of enthalpy as     H = U + p V ,   {\displaystyle H=U+pV,}
[{\displaystyle H=U+pV,}] the enthalpy change at constant pressure     &#x0394;
H = &#x0394; U + p &#x0394; V .   {\displaystyle \Delta H=\Delta U+p\Delta V.}
[{\displaystyle \Delta H=\Delta U+p\Delta V.}] However for most chemical
reactions, the work term     p &#x0394; V   {\displaystyle p\Delta V}  [
{\displaystyle p\Delta V}] is much smaller than the internal energy change
&#x0394; U   {\displaystyle \Delta U}  [\Delta U] which is approximately equal
to     &#x0394; H .   {\displaystyle \Delta H.}  [{\displaystyle \Delta H.}] As
an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O2(g) â 2 CO2(g),
&#x0394; H   {\displaystyle \Delta H}  [\Delta H] = â566.0 kJ and
&#x0394; U   {\displaystyle \Delta U}  [\Delta U] = â563.5 kJ.[26] Since the
differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often loosely described as
reaction energies and analyzed in terms of bond_energies.
**** Specific enthalpy[edit] ****
The specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as h = H/m where m is the
mass of the system. The SI_unit for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram. It
can be expressed in other specific quantities by h = u + pv, where u is the
specific internal_energy, p is the pressure, and v is specific_volume, which is
equal to 1/Ï, where Ï is the density.
**** Enthalpy changes[edit] ****
An enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the
constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or
chemical reaction. It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process
has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the products, and the initial enthalpy of
the system, i.e. the reactants. These processes are reversible[why?] and the
enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change.
A common standard enthalpy change is the enthalpy_of_formation, which has been
determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely
measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the CRC
Handbook_of_Chemistry_and_Physics. The following is a selection of enthalpy
changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.
When used in these recognized terms the qualifier change is usually dropped and
the property is simply termed enthalpy of 'process'. Since these properties are
often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a
standardized set of environmental parameters, or standard_conditions,
including:
    * A temperature of 25 Â°C or 298.15 K,
    * A pressure of one atmosphere (1 atm or 101.325 kPa),
    * A concentration of 1.0 M when the element or compound is present in
      solution,
    * Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. standard
      state.
For such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with
the term standard, e.g. standard enthalpy of formation.

      (non-reacting) chemical substances.
**** Open systems[edit] ****
In thermodynamic open_systems, matter may flow in and out of the system
boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The
increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy
added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost
by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:
         d U = &#x03B4; Q + d  U  in   &#x2212; d  U  out   &#x2212; &#x03B4; W
      ,   {\displaystyle dU=\delta Q+dU_{\text{in}}-dU_{\text{out}}-\delta W,}
      [{\displaystyle dU=\delta Q+dU_{\text{in}}-dU_{\text{out}}-\delta W,}]
where Uin is the average internal energy entering the system, and Uout is the
average internal energy leaving the system.
During steady,_continuous operation, an energy balance applied to an open
system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net
enthalpy added
The region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually
called a control_volume, and it may or may not correspond to physical walls. If
we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs
perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of matter into the system performs
work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the
system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston
of fluid. There are then two types of work performed: flow work described
above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called pV work), and
shaft work, which may be performed on some mechanical device.
These two types of work are expressed in the equation
         &#x03B4; W = d (  p  out    V  out   ) &#x2212; d (  p  in    V  in
      ) + &#x03B4;  W  shaft   .   {\displaystyle \delta W=d(p_{\text{out}}V_
      {\text{out}})-d(p_{\text{in}}V_{\text{in}})+\delta W_{\text{shaft}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle \delta W=d(p_{\text{out}}V_{\text{out}})-d(p_{\text{in}}V_
      {\text{in}})+\delta W_{\text{shaft}}.}]
Substitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields:
         d  U  cv   = &#x03B4; Q + d  U  in   + d (  p  in    V  in   )
      &#x2212; d  U  out   &#x2212; d (  p  out    V  out   ) &#x2212; &#x03B4;
      W  shaft   .   {\displaystyle dU_{\text{cv}}=\delta Q+dU_{\text{in}}+d(p_
      {\text{in}}V_{\text{in}})-dU_{\text{out}}-d(p_{\text{out}}V_{\text
      {out}})-\delta W_{\text{shaft}}.}  [{\displaystyle dU_{\text{cv}}=\delta
      Q+dU_{\text{in}}+d(p_{\text{in}}V_{\text{in}})-dU_{\text{out}}-d(p_{\text
      {out}}V_{\text{out}})-\delta W_{\text{shaft}}.}]
The definition of enthalpy, H, permits us to use this thermodynamic_potential
to account for both internal energy and pV work in fluids for open systems:
         d  U  cv   = &#x03B4; Q + d  H  in   &#x2212; d  H  out   &#x2212;
      &#x03B4;  W  shaft   .   {\displaystyle dU_{\text{cv}}=\delta Q+dH_{\text
      {in}}-dH_{\text{out}}-\delta W_{\text{shaft}}.}  [{\displaystyle dU_
      {\text{cv}}=\delta Q+dH_{\text{in}}-dH_{\text{out}}-\delta W_{\text
      {shaft}}.}]
If we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons), we
get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.[27] In terms of
time derivatives it reads:
            d U   d t    =  &#x2211;  k       Q &#x02D9;     k   +  &#x2211;  k
      H &#x02D9;     k   &#x2212;  &#x2211;  k    p  k      d  V  k     d t
      &#x2212; P ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {dU}{dt}}=\sum _{k}{\dot {Q}}_
      {k}+\sum _{k}{\dot {H}}_{k}-\sum _{k}p_{k}{\frac {dV_{k}}{dt}}-P,}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {dU}{dt}}=\sum _{k}{\dot {Q}}_{k}+\sum _{k}{\dot
      {H}}_{k}-\sum _{k}p_{k}{\frac {dV_{k}}{dt}}-P,}]
with sums over the various places k where heat is supplied, matter flows into
the system, and boundaries are moving. The á¸¢k terms represent enthalpy flows,
which can be written as
             H &#x02D9;     k   =  h  k       m &#x02D9;     k   =  H   m
      n &#x02D9;     k   ,   {\displaystyle {\dot {H}}_{k}=h_{k}{\dot {m}}_
      {k}=H_{\mathrm {m} }{\dot {n}}_{k},}  [{\displaystyle {\dot {H}}_{k}=h_
      {k}{\dot {m}}_{k}=H_{\mathrm {m} }{\dot {n}}_{k},}]
with á¹k the mass flow and á¹k the molar flow at position k respectively. The
term dVk/dt represents the rate of change of the system volume at position k
that results in pV power done by the system. The parameter P represents all
other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be
e.g. electric power produced by an electrical power plant.
Note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow
rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet.[clarification_needed]
Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During steady-state
operation of a device (see turbine, pump, and engine), the average dU/dt may be
set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average power
generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:
         P =  &#x2211;  k    &#x27E8;     Q &#x02D9;     k   &#x27E9;  +
      &#x2211;  k    &#x27E8;     H &#x02D9;     k   &#x27E9;  &#x2212;
      &#x2211;  k    &#x27E8;   p  k      d  V  k     d t     &#x27E9;  ,
      {\displaystyle P=\sum _{k}\left\langle {\dot {Q}}_{k}\right\rangle +\sum
      _{k}\left\langle {\dot {H}}_{k}\right\rangle -\sum _{k}\left\langle p_{k}
      {\frac {dV_{k}}{dt}}\right\rangle ,}  [{\displaystyle P=\sum _
      {k}\left\langle {\dot {Q}}_{k}\right\rangle +\sum _{k}\left\langle {\dot
      {H}}_{k}\right\rangle -\sum _{k}\left\langle p_{k}{\frac {dV_{k}}
      {dt}}\right\rangle ,}]
where the angle_brackets denote time averages. The technical importance of the
enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems,
as formulated above.
***** Diagrams[edit] *****
Tâs diagram of nitrogen.[28] The red curve at the left is the melting curve.
The red dome represents the two-phase region with the low-entropy side the
saturated liquid and the high-entropy side the saturated gas. The black curves
give the Tâs relation along isobars. The pressures are indicated in bar. The
blue curves are isenthalps (curves of constant enthalpy). The values are
indicated in blue in kJ/kg. The specific points a, b, etc., are treated in the
main text.
The enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial
software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either
in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as
hâT diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for
various pressures, and hâp diagrams, which give h as function of p for
various T. One of the most common diagrams is the temperatureâspecific
entropy diagram (Tâs-diagram). It gives the melting curve and saturated
liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams
are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.
**** Some basic applications[edit] ****
The points a through h in the figure play a role in the discussion in this
section.

      h: T = 77.2 K, p = 1 bar, s = 5.41 kJ/(kg K), h = 230 kJ/kg (saturated
      gas at 1 bar);
**** Throttling[edit] ****
Main article: JouleâThomson_effect
Schematic diagram of a throttling in the steady state. Fluid enters the system
(dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is á¹.
One of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called
throttling process, also known as Joule-Thomson_expansion. It concerns a steady
adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any
other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure. This process is very
important, since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators, where it is
responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the
interior of the refrigerator. It is also the final stage in many types of
liquefiers.
For a steady state flow regime, the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle)
has to be constant. Hence
         0 =    m &#x02D9;     h  1   &#x2212;    m &#x02D9;     h  2   .
      {\displaystyle 0={\dot {m}}h_{1}-{\dot {m}}h_{2}.}  [{\displaystyle 0=
      {\dot {m}}h_{1}-{\dot {m}}h_{2}.}]
Since the mass flow is constant, the specific enthalpies at the two sides of
the flow resistance are the same:
          h  1   =  h  2   ,   {\displaystyle h_{1}=h_{2},}  [{\displaystyle h_
      {1}=h_{2},}]
that is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The
consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the Tâs diagram
above. Point c is at 200 bar and room temperature (300 K). A JouleâThomson
expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly
425 kJ/kg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450 kJ/kg
isenthalps and ends in point d, which is at a temperature of about 270 K. Hence
the expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar cools nitrogen from 300 K to 270 K. In the
valve, there is a lot of friction, and a lot of entropy is produced, but still
the final temperature is below the starting value!
Point e is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with h = 100 kJ/
kg. It corresponds roughly with p = 13 bar and T = 108 K. Throttling from this
point to a pressure of 1 bar ends in the two-phase region (point f). This means
that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the
enthalpy is an extensive parameter, the enthalpy in f (hf) is equal to the
enthalpy in g (hg) multiplied by the liquid fraction in f (xf) plus the
enthalpy in h (hh) multiplied by the gas fraction in f (1 â xf). So
          h   f    =  x   f     h   g    + ( 1 &#x2212;  x   f    )  h   h    .
      {\displaystyle h_{\mathbf {f} }=x_{\mathbf {f} }h_{\mathbf {g} }+(1-x_
      {\mathbf {f} })h_{\mathbf {h} }.}  [{\displaystyle h_{\mathbf {f} }=x_
      {\mathbf {f} }h_{\mathbf {g} }+(1-x_{\mathbf {f} })h_{\mathbf {h} }.}]
With numbers: 100 = xf Ã 28 + (1 â xf) Ã 230, so xf = 0.64. This means that
the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquidâgas mixture that leaves the
throttling valve is 64%.
**** Compressors[edit] ****
Main article: Gas_compressor
Schematic diagram of a compressor in the steady state. Fluid enters the system
(dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is á¹. A
power P is applied and a heat flow QÌ is released to the surroundings at
ambient temperature Ta.
A power P is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is adiabatic,
the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant
entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in the Tâs diagram. For
example, compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point a) to 2 bar (point b) would
result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the
compressed gas exit at ambient temperature Ta, heat exchange, e.g. by cooling
water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The
average heat flow to the surroundings is QÌ. Since the system is in the steady
state the first law gives
         0 = &#x2212;    Q &#x02D9;    +    m &#x02D9;     h  1   &#x2212;    m
      &#x02D9;     h  2   + P .   {\displaystyle 0=-{\dot {Q}}+{\dot {m}}h_{1}-
      {\dot {m}}h_{2}+P.}  [{\displaystyle 0=-{\dot {Q}}+{\dot {m}}h_{1}-{\dot
      {m}}h_{2}+P.}]
The minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is
reversible. In that case the second_law_of_thermodynamics for open systems
gives
         0 = &#x2212;     Q &#x02D9;    T   a      +    m &#x02D9;     s  1
      &#x2212;    m &#x02D9;     s  2   .   {\displaystyle 0=-{\frac {\dot {Q}}
      {T_{\mathrm {a} }}}+{\dot {m}}s_{1}-{\dot {m}}s_{2}.}  [{\displaystyle
      0=-{\frac {\dot {Q}}{T_{\mathrm {a} }}}+{\dot {m}}s_{1}-{\dot {m}}s_
      {2}.}]
Eliminating QÌ gives for the minimal power
            P  min     m &#x02D9;     =  h  2   &#x2212;  h  1   &#x2212;  T
      a    (  s  2   &#x2212;  s  1   ) .   {\displaystyle {\frac {P_{\text
      {min}}}{\dot {m}}}=h_{2}-h_{1}-T_{\mathrm {a} }(s_{2}-s_{1}).}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {P_{\text{min}}}{\dot {m}}}=h_{2}-h_{1}-T_{\mathrm
      {a} }(s_{2}-s_{1}).}]
For example, compressing 1 kg of nitrogen from 1 bar to 200 bar costs at least
(hc â ha) â Ta(sc â sa). With the data, obtained with the Tâs diagram,
we find a value of (430 â 461) â 300 Ã (5.16 â 6.85) = 476 kJ/kg.
The relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as
            P  min     m &#x02D9;     =  &#x222B;  1   2   ( d h &#x2212;  T
      a     d s ) .   {\displaystyle {\frac {P_{\text{min}}}{\dot {m}}}=\int _
      {1}^{2}(dh-T_{\mathrm {a} }\,ds).}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {P_{\text
      {min}}}{\dot {m}}}=\int _{1}^{2}(dh-T_{\mathrm {a} }\,ds).}]
With dh = T ds + v dp, this results in the final relation
            P  min     m &#x02D9;     =  &#x222B;  1   2   v  d p .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {P_{\text{min}}}{\dot {m}}}=\int _{1}^{2}v\,dp.}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {P_{\text{min}}}{\dot {m}}}=\int _{1}^{2}v\,dp.}]
