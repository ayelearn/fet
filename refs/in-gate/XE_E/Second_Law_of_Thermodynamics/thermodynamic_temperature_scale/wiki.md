Thermodynamic temperature is the absolute measure of temperature and is one of
the principal parameters of thermodynamics.
Thermodynamic temperature is defined by the third_law_of_thermodynamics in
which the theoretically lowest temperature is the null or zero point. At this
point, absolute_zero, the particle constituents of matter have minimal motion
and can become no colder.[1][2] In the quantum-mechanical description, matter
at absolute zero is in its ground_state, which is its state of lowest energy.
Thermodynamic temperature is often also called absolute temperature, for two
reasons: one, proposed by Kelvin, that it does not depend on the properties of
a particular material; two that it refers to an absolute zero according to the
properties of the ideal gas.
The International_System_of_Units specifies a particular scale for
thermodynamic temperature. It uses the kelvin scale for measurement and selects
the triple_point of water at 273.16Â K as the fundamental fixing point. Other
scales have been in use historically. The Rankine_scale, using the degree
Fahrenheit as its unit interval, is still in use as part of the English
Engineering_Units in the United States in some engineering fields. ITS-90 gives
a practical means of estimating the thermodynamic temperature to a very high
degree of accuracy.
Roughly, the temperature of a body at rest is a measure of the mean of the
energy of the translational, vibrational and rotational motions of matter's
particle constituents, such as molecules, atoms, and subatomic_particles. The
full variety of these kinetic motions, along with potential energies of
particles, and also occasionally certain other types of particle energy in
equilibrium with these, make up the total internal_energy of a substance.
Internal energy is loosely called the heat energy or thermal_energy in
conditions when no work is done upon the substance by its surroundings, or by
the substance upon the surroundings. Internal energy may be stored in a number
of ways within a substance, each way constituting a "degree of freedom". At
equilibrium, each degree of freedom will have on average the same energy:
k  B   T  /  2   {\displaystyle k_{B}T/2}  [k_{B}T/2] where      k  B
{\displaystyle k_{B}}  [k_{B}] is the Boltzmann_constant, unless that degree of
freedom is in the quantum regime. The internal degrees of freedom (rotation,
vibration, etc.) may be in the quantum regime at room temperature, but the
translational degrees of freedom will be in the classical regime except at
extremely low temperatures (fractions of kelvins) and it may be said that, for
most situations, the thermodynamic temperature is specified by the average
translational kinetic energy of the particles.

***** Overview[edit] *****
Temperature is a measure of the random submicroscopic motions and vibrations of
the particle constituents of matter. These motions comprise the internal_energy
of a substance. More specifically, the thermodynamic temperature of any bulk
quantity of matter is the measure of the average kinetic energy per classical
(i.e., non-quantum) degree of freedom of its constituent particles.
"Translational motions" are almost always in the classical regime.
Translational motions are ordinary, whole-body movements in three-dimensional
space in which particles move about and exchange energy in collisions. FigureÂ 1
below shows translational motion in gases; FigureÂ 4 below shows translational
motion in solids. Thermodynamic temperature's null point, absolute zero, is the
temperature at which the particle constituents of matter are as close as
possible to complete rest; that is, they have minimal motion, retaining only
quantum_mechanical motion.[3] Zero kinetic energy remains in a substance at
absolute zero (see Thermal_energy_at_absolute_zero, below).
Throughout the scientific world where measurements are made in SI units,
thermodynamic temperature is measured in kelvins (symbol:Â K). Many engineering
fields in the U.S. however, measure thermodynamic temperature using the Rankine
scale.
By international_agreement, the unit kelvin and its scale are defined by two
points: absolute zero, and the triple_point of Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water
(water with a specified blend of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes). Absolute zero,
the lowest possible temperature, is defined as being precisely 0Â K and
Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C. The triple_point of water is defined as being precisely 273.16Â K
and 0.01Â Ã‚Â°C. This definition does three things:
   1. It fixes the magnitude of the kelvin unit as being precisely 1 part in
      273.16 parts the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of
      water;
   2. It establishes that one kelvin has precisely the same magnitude as a one-
      degree increment on the Celsius scale; and
   3. It establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as
      being precisely 273.15 kelvins (0Â K = Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C and 273.16Â K =
      0.01Â Ã‚Â°C).
Temperatures expressed in kelvins (TK) are converted to degrees Rankine (TÃ‚Â°R)
simply by multiplying by 1.8 (TÃ‚Â°RÂ =Â 1.8Â ÃƒÂ—Â TK). Temperatures expressed in
degrees Rankine are converted to kelvins by dividing by 1.8 (TKÂ =Â TÃ‚Â°RÂ ÃƒÂ·Â 1.8).
**** Practical realization[edit] ****
Main article: ITS-90
Although the kelvin and Celsius scales are defined using absolute zero (0 K)
and the triple point of water (273.16 K and 0.01Â Ã‚Â°C), it is impractical to use
this definition at temperatures that are very different from the triple point
of water. ITS-90 is then designed to represent the thermodynamic temperature as
closely as possible throughout its range. Many different thermometer designs
are required to cover the entire range. These include helium vapor pressure
thermometers, helium gas thermometers, standard_platinum_resistance
thermometers (known as SPRTs, PRTs or Platinum RTDs) and monochromatic
radiation_thermometers.
For some types of thermometer the relationship between the property observed
(e.g., length of a mercury column) and temperature, is close to linear, so for
most purposes a linear scale is sufficient, without point-by-point calibration.
For others a calibration curve or equation is required. The mercury
thermometer, invented before the thermodynamic temperature was understood,
originally defined the temperature scale; its linearity made readings correlate
well with true temperature, i.e. the "mercury" temperature scale was a close
fit to the true scale.
***** The relationship of temperature, motions, conduction, and thermal energy
[edit] *****
Fig. 1 The translational motion of fundamental particles of nature such as
atoms and molecules are directly related to temperature. Here, the size of
helium atoms relative to their spacing is shown to scale under 1950 atmospheres
of pressure. These room-temperature atoms have a certain average speed (slowed
down here two trillion-fold). At any given instant however, a particular helium
atom may be moving much faster than average while another may be nearly
motionless. Five atoms are colored red to facilitate following their motions.
**** The nature of kinetic energy, translational motion, and temperature[edit]
****
The thermodynamic temperature is a measure of the average energy of the
translational, vibrational and rotational motions of matter's particle
constituents (molecules, atoms, and subatomic_particles). The full variety of
these kinetic motions, along with potential energies of particles, and also
occasionally certain other types of particle energy in equilibrium with these,
contribute the total internal_energy (loosely, the thermal_energy) of a
substance. Thus, internal energy may be stored in a number of ways (degrees of
freedom) within a substance. When the degrees of freedom are in the classical
regime ("unfrozen") the temperature is very simply related to the average
energy of those degrees of freedom at equilibrium. The three translational
degrees of freedom are unfrozen except at the very lowest temperatures, and
their kinetic energy is simply related to the thermodynamic temperature over
the widest range. The heat_capacity, which relates heat input and temperature
change, is discussed below.
The relationship of kinetic energy, mass, and velocity is given by the formula
EkÂ =Â &#x200b;1â„2mv2.[4] Accordingly, particles with one unit of mass moving at
one unit of velocity have precisely the same kinetic energy, and precisely the
same temperature, as those with four times the mass but half the velocity.
Except in the quantum regime at extremely low temperatures, the thermodynamic
temperature of any bulk quantity of a substance (a statistically significant
quantity of particles) is directly proportional to the mean average kinetic
energy of a specific kind of particle motion known as translational motion.
These simple movements in the three x, y, and zÃ¢Â€Â“axis dimensions of space
means the particles move in the three spatial degrees_of_freedom. The
temperature derived from this translational kinetic energy is sometimes
referred to as kinetic temperature and is equal to the thermodynamic
temperature over a very wide range of temperatures. Since there are three
translational degrees of freedom (e.g., motion along the x, y, and z axes), the
translational kinetic energy is related to the kinetic temperature by:
            E &#x00AF;     =    3 2    k  B    T  k     {\displaystyle {\bar
      {E}}\,=\,{\frac {3}{2}}k_{B}T_{k}}  [{\bar {E}}\,=\,{\frac {3}{2}}k_{B}T_
      {k}]
where:
    *        E &#x00AF;       {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\bar {E}}}
      [\scriptstyle {\bar {E}}] is the mean kinetic energy in joules (J)
    * kB = 1.3806504(24)ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’23Â J/K is the Boltzmann_constant
    *     T  k     {\displaystyle T_{k}}  [T_{k}] is the kinetic temperature in
      kelvins (K)
Fig. 2 The translational motions of helium atoms occur across a range of
speeds. Compare the shape of this curve to that of a Planck curve in
Fig.Â 5Â below.
While the Boltzmann constant is useful for finding the mean kinetic energy of a
particle, it's important to note that even when a substance is isolated and in
thermodynamic_equilibrium (all parts are at a uniform temperature and no heat
is going into or out of it), the translational motions of individual atoms and
molecules occur across a wide range of speeds (see animation in FigureÂ 1
above). At any one instant, the proportion of particles moving at a given speed
within this range is determined by probability as described by the
MaxwellÃ¢Â€Â“Boltzmann_distribution. The graph shown here in Fig.Â 2Â  shows the
speed distribution of 5500Â K helium atoms. They have a most probable speed of
4.780Â km/s. However, a certain proportion of atoms at any given instant are
moving faster while others are moving relatively slowly; some are momentarily
at a virtual standstill (off the xÃ¢Â€Â“axis to the right). This graph uses
inverse speed for its xÃ¢Â€Â“axis so the shape of the curve can easily be compared
to the curves in FigureÂ 5 below. In both graphs, zero on the xÃ¢Â€Â“axis
represents infinite temperature. Additionally, the x and yÃ¢Â€Â“axis on both
graphs are scaled proportionally.
**** The high speeds of translational motion[edit] ****
Although very specialized laboratory equipment is required to directly detect
translational motions, the resultant collisions by atoms or molecules with
small particles suspended in a fluid produces Brownian_motion that can be seen
with an ordinary microscope. The translational motions of elementary particles
are very fast[5] and temperatures close to absolute zero are required to
directly observe them. For instance, when scientists at the NIST achieved a
record-setting cold temperature of 700Â nK (billionths of a kelvin) in 1994,
they used optical_lattice laser equipment to adiabatically cool caesium atoms.
They then turned off the entrapment lasers and directly measured atom
velocities of 7Â mm per second in order to calculate their temperature.[6]Â 
Formulas for calculating the velocity and speed of translational motion are
given in the following footnote.[7]
Because of their internal structure and flexibility, molecules can store
kinetic energy in internal degrees of freedom which contribute to the heat
capacity.
There are other forms of internal energy besides the kinetic energy of
translational motion. As can be seen in the animation at right, molecules are
complex objects; they are a population of atoms and thermal agitation can
strain their internal chemical_bonds in three different ways: via rotation,
bond length, and bond angle movements. These are all types of internal degrees
of freedom. This makes molecules distinct from monatomic substances (consisting
of individual atoms) like the noble_gases helium and argon, which have only the
three translational degrees of freedom. Kinetic energy is stored in molecules'
internal degrees of freedom, which gives them an internal temperature. Even
though these motions are called internal, the external portions of molecules
still moveÃ¢Â€Â”rather like the jiggling of a stationary water_balloon. This
permits the two-way exchange of kinetic energy between internal motions and
translational motions with each molecular collision. Accordingly, as energy is
removed from molecules, both their kinetic temperature (the temperature derived
from the kinetic energy of translational motion) and their internal temperature
simultaneously diminish in equal proportions. This phenomenon is described by
the equipartition_theorem, which states that for any bulk quantity of a
substance in equilibrium, the kinetic energy of particle motion is evenly
distributed among all the active (i.e. unfrozen) degrees of freedom available
to the particles. Since the internal temperature of molecules is usually equal
to their kinetic temperature, the distinction is usually of interest only in
the detailed study of non-local_thermodynamic_equilibrium (LTE) phenomena such
as combustion, the sublimation of solids, and the diffusion of hot gases in a
partial vacuum.
The kinetic energy stored internally in molecules causes substances to contain
more internal energy at any given temperature and to absorb additional internal
energy for a given temperature increase. This is because any kinetic energy
that is, at a given instant, bound in internal motions is not at that same
instant contributing to the molecules' translational motions.[8] This extra
thermal energy simply increases the amount of energy a substance absorbs for a
given temperature rise. This property is known as a substance's specific_heat
capacity.
Different molecules absorb different amounts of thermal energy for each
incremental increase in temperature; that is, they have different specific heat
capacities. High specific heat capacity arises, in part, because certain
substances' molecules possess more internal degrees of freedom than others do.
For instance, nitrogen, which is a diatomic molecule, has five active degrees
of freedom at room temperature: the three comprising translational motion plus
two rotational degrees of freedom internally. Since the two internal degrees of
freedom are essentially unfrozen, in accordance with the equipartition theorem,
nitrogen has five-thirds the specific heat capacity per mole (a specific number
of molecules) as do the monatomic gases.[9] Another example is gasoline (see
table showing its specific heat capacity). Gasoline can absorb a large amount
of thermal energy per mole with only a modest temperature change because each
molecule comprises an average of 21 atoms and therefore has many internal
degrees of freedom. Even larger, more complex molecules can have dozens of
internal degrees of freedom.
**** The diffusion of thermal energy: Entropy, phonons, and mobile conduction
electrons[edit] ****
Fig. 4 The temperature-induced translational motion of particles in solids
takes the form of phonons.Shown here are phonons with identical amplitudes but
with wavelengths ranging from 2 to 12 molecules.
Heat_conductionis the diffusion of thermal energy from hot parts of a system to
cold. A system can be either a single bulk entity or a plurality of discrete
bulk entities. The term bulk in this context means a statistically significant
quantity of particles (which can be a microscopic amount). Whenever thermal
energy diffuses within an isolated system, temperature differences within the
system decrease (and entropy increases).
One particular heat conduction mechanism occurs when translational motion, the
particle motion underlying temperature, transfers momentum from particle to
particle in collisions. In gases, these translational motions are of the nature
shown above in Fig.Â 1.As can be seen in that animation, not only does momentum
(heat) diffuse throughout the volume of the gas through serial collisions, but
entire molecules or atoms can move forward into new territory, bringing their
kinetic energy with them. Consequently, temperature differences equalize
throughout gases very quicklyÃ¢Â€Â”especially for light atoms or molecules;
convection speeds this process even more.[10]
Translational motion in solids, however, takes the form of phonons(see Fig.Â 4
at right). Phonons are constrained, quantized wave packets that travel at a
given substance's speed of sound. The manner in which phonons interact within a
solid determines a variety of its properties, including its thermal
conductivity. In electrically insulating solids, phonon-based heat conduction
is usually inefficient[11] and such solids are considered thermal insulators
(such as glass, plastic, rubber, ceramic, and rock). This is because in solids,
atoms and molecules are locked into place relative to their neighbors and are
not free to roam.
Metals however, are not restricted to only phonon-based heat conduction.
Thermal energy conducts through metals extraordinarily quickly because instead
of direct molecule-to-molecule collisions, the vast majority of thermal energy
is mediated via very light, mobile conduction electrons. This is why there is a
near-perfect correlation between metals' thermal_conductivity and their
electrical_conductivity.[12] Conduction electrons imbue metals with their
extraordinary conductivity because they are delocalized (i.e., not tied to a
specific atom) and behave rather like a sort of quantum gas due to the effects
of zero-point_energy (for more on ZPE, see Note_1 below). Furthermore,
electrons are relatively light with a rest mass only &#x200b;1â„1836th that of a
proton. This is about the same ratio as a .22_Short bullet (29 grains or
1.88Â g) compared to the rifle that shoots it. As Isaac_Newton wrote with his
third_law_of_motion,
     Law #3: All forces occur in pairs, and these two forces are equal in
     magnitude and opposite in direction.
However, a bullet accelerates faster than a rifle given an equal force. Since
kinetic energy increases as the square of velocity, nearly all the kinetic
energy goes into the bullet, not the rifle, even though both experience the
same force from the expanding propellant gases. In the same manner, because
they are much less massive, thermal energy is readily borne by mobile
conduction electrons. Additionally, because they're delocalized and very fast,
kinetic thermal energy conducts extremely quickly through metals with abundant
conduction electrons.
**** The diffusion of thermal energy: Black-body radiation[edit] ****
Fig. 5 The spectrum of black-body radiation has the form of a Planck curve. A
5500Â K black-body has a peak emittance wavelength of 527Â nm. Compare the shape
of this curve to that of a Maxwell distribution in Fig.Â 2Â above.
Thermal_radiation is a byproduct of the collisions arising from various
vibrational motions of atoms. These collisions cause the electrons of the atoms
to emit thermal photons (known as black-body radiation). Photons are emitted
anytime an electric charge is accelerated (as happens when electron clouds of
two atoms collide). Even individual molecules with internal temperatures
greater than absolute zero also emit black-body radiation from their atoms. In
any bulk quantity of a substance at equilibrium, black-body photons are emitted
across a range of wavelengths in a spectrum that has a bell curve-like shape
called a Planck_curve (see graph in Fig.Â 5 at right). The top of a Planck curve
(the_peak_emittance_wavelength) is located in a particular part of the
electromagnetic_spectrum depending on the temperature of the black-body.
Substances at extreme cryogenic temperatures emit at long radio wavelengths
whereas extremely hot temperatures produce short gamma_rays (see Table_of
common_temperatures).
Black-body radiation diffuses thermal energy throughout a substance as the
photons are absorbed by neighboring atoms, transferring momentum in the
process. Black-body photons also easily escape from a substance and can be
absorbed by the ambient environment; kinetic energy is lost in the process.
As established by the StefanÃ¢Â€Â“Boltzmann_law, the intensity of black-body
radiation increases as the fourth power of absolute temperature. Thus, a black-
body at 824Â K (just short of glowing dull red) emits 60 times the radiant power
as it does at 296Â K (room temperature). This is why one can so easily feel the
radiant heat from hot objects at a distance. At higher temperatures, such as
those found in an incandescent_lamp, black-body radiation can be the principal
mechanism by which thermal energy escapes a system.

*** The heat of phase changes[edit] ***
Fig. 6Â  Ice and water: two phases of the same substance
The kinetic energy of particle motion is just one contributor to the total
thermal energy in a substance; another is phase_transitions, which are the
potential_energy of molecular bonds that can form in a substance as it cools
(such as during condensing and freezing). The thermal energy required for a
phase transition is called latent_heat. This phenomenon may more easily be
grasped by considering it in the reverse direction: latent heat is the energy
required to break chemical_bonds (such as during evaporation and melting).
Almost everyone is familiar with the effects of phase transitions; for
instance, steam at 100Â Ã‚Â°C can cause severe burns much faster than the 100Â Ã‚Â°C
air from a hair_dryer. This occurs because a large amount of latent heat is
liberated as steam condenses into liquid water on the skin.
Even though thermal energy is liberated or absorbed during phase transitions,
pure chemical_elements, compounds, and eutectic alloys exhibit no temperature
change whatsoever while they undergo them (see Fig.Â 7, below right). Consider
one particular type of phase transition: melting. When a solid is melting,
crystal_lattice chemical_bonds are being broken apart; the substance is
transitioning from what is known as a more ordered state to a less ordered
state. In Fig.Â 7,the melting of ice is shown within the lower left box heading
from blue to green.
Fig. 7 Water's temperature does not change during phase transitions as heat
flows into or out of it. The total heat capacity of a mole of water in its
liquid phase (the green line) is 7.5507Â kJ.
At one specific thermodynamic point, the melting_point (which is 0Â Ã‚Â°C across a
wide pressure range in the case of water), all the atoms or molecules are, on
average, at the maximum energy threshold their chemical bonds can withstand
without breaking away from the lattice. Chemical bonds are all-or-nothing
forces: they either hold fast, or break; there is no in-between state.
Consequently, when a substance is at its melting point, every joule of added
thermal energy only breaks the bonds of a specific quantity of its atoms or
molecules,[25] converting them into a liquid of precisely the same temperature;
no kinetic energy is added to translational motion (which is what gives
substances their temperature). The effect is rather like popcorn: at a certain
temperature, additional thermal energy can't make the kernels any hotter until
the transition (popping) is complete. If the process is reversed (as in the
freezing of a liquid), thermal energy must be removed from a substance.
As stated above, the thermal energy required for a phase transition is called
latent heat. In the specific cases of melting and freezing, it's called
enthalpy_of_fusion or heat of fusion. If the molecular bonds in a crystal
lattice are strong, the heat of fusion can be relatively great, typically in
the range of 6 to 30Â kJ per mole for water and most of the metallic elements.
[26] If the substance is one of the monatomic gases, (which have little
tendency to form molecular bonds) the heat of fusion is more modest, ranging
from 0.021 to 2.3Â kJ per mole.[27] Relatively speaking, phase transitions can
be truly energetic events. To completely melt ice at 0Â Ã‚Â°C into water at 0Â Ã‚Â°C,
one must add roughly 80 times the thermal energy as is required to increase the
temperature of the same mass of liquid water by one degree Celsius. The metals'
ratios are even greater, typically in the range of 400 to 1200 times.[28] And
the phase transition of boiling is much more energetic than freezing. For
instance, the energy required to completely boil or vaporize water (what is
known as enthalpy_of_vaporization) is roughly 540 times that required for a
one-degree increase.[29]
Water's sizable enthalpy of vaporization is why one's skin can be burned so
quickly as steam condenses on it (heading from red to green in Fig.Â 7Â above).
In the opposite direction, this is why one's skin feels cool as liquid water on
it evaporates (a process that occurs at a sub-ambient wet-bulb_temperature that
is dependent on relative_humidity). Water's highly energetic enthalpy of
vaporization is also an important factor underlying why solar pool covers
(floating, insulated blankets that cover swimming_pools when not in use) are so
effective at reducing heating costs: they prevent evaporation. For instance,
the evaporation of just 20Â mm of water from a 1.29-meter-deep pool chills its
water 8.4 degrees Celsius (15.1Â Ã‚Â°F).
*** Internal energy[edit] ***
The total energy of all particle motion translational and internal, including
that of conduction electrons, plus the potential energy of phase changes, plus
zero-point_energy[3] comprise the internal_energy of a substance.
Fig. 8 When many of the chemical elements, such as the noble_gases and
platinum-group_metals, freeze to a solid Ã¢Â€Â” the most ordered state of matter
Ã¢Â€Â” their crystal_structures have a close-packed_arrangement. This yields the
greatest possible packing density and the lowest energy state.
*** Internal energy at absolute zero[edit] ***
As a substance cools, different forms of internal energy and their related
effects simultaneously decrease in magnitude: the latent heat of available
phase transitions is liberated as a substance changes from a less ordered state
to a more ordered state; the translational motions of atoms and molecules
diminish (their kinetic temperature decreases); the internal motions of
molecules diminish (their internal temperature decreases); conduction electrons
(if the substance is an electrical conductor) travel somewhat slower;[30] and
black-body radiation's peak emittance wavelength increases (the photons' energy
decreases). When the particles of a substance are as close as possible to
complete rest and retain only ZPE-induced quantum mechanical motion, the
substance is at the temperature of absolute zero (T=0).
Note that whereas absolute zero is the point of zero thermodynamic temperature
and is also the point at which the particle constituents of matter have minimal
motion, absolute zero is not necessarily the point at which a substance
contains zero thermal energy; one must be very precise with what one means by
internal energy. Often, all the phase changes that can occur in a substance,
will have occurred by the time it reaches absolute zero. However, this is not
always the case. Notably, T=0 helium remains liquid at room pressure and must
be under a pressure of at least 25Â bar (2.5Â MPa) to crystallize. This is
because helium's heat of fusion (the energy required to melt helium ice) is so
low (only 21Â joules per mole) that the motion-inducing effect of zero-point
energy is sufficient to prevent it from freezing at lower pressures. Only if
under at least 25Â bar (2.5Â MPa) of pressure will this latent thermal energy be
liberated as helium freezes while approaching absolute zero. A further
complication is that many solids change their crystal structure to more compact
arrangements at extremely high pressures (up to millions of bars, or hundreds
of gigapascals). These are known as solid-solid phase transitions wherein
latent heat is liberated as a crystal lattice changes to a more
thermodynamically favorable, compact one.
The above complexities make for rather cumbersome blanket statements regarding
the internal energy in T=0 substances. Regardless of pressure though, what can
be said is that at absolute zero, all solids with a lowest-energy crystal
lattice such those with a closest-packed_arrangement (see Fig.Â 8, above left)
contain minimal internal energy, retaining only that due to the ever-present
background of zero-point energy.[3]Â [31] One can also say that for a given
substance at constant pressure, absolute zero is the point of lowest enthalpy
(a measure of work potential that takes internal energy, pressure, and volume
into consideration).[32] Lastly, it is always true to say that all T=0
substances contain zero kinetic thermal energy.[3]Â [7]
***** Practical applications for thermodynamic temperature[edit] *****
Helium-4, is a superfluid at or below 2.17 kelvins, (2.17 Celsius degrees above
absolute_zero)
Thermodynamic temperature is useful not only for scientists, it can also be
useful for lay-people in many disciplines involving gases. By expressing
variables in absolute terms and applying GayÃ¢Â€Â“Lussac's_law of temperature/
pressure proportionality, solutions to everyday problems are straightforward;
for instance, calculating how a temperature change affects the pressure inside
an automobile tire. If the tire has a cold pressure of 200Â kPa-gage , then in
absolute terms (relative to a vacuum), its pressure is 300Â kPa-absolute.[33]
[34][35] Room temperature ("cold" in tire terms) is 296Â K. If the tire
temperature is 20Â Ã‚Â°C hotter (20Â kelvins), the solution is calculated as
&#x200b;316 Kâ„296 KÂ = 6.8% greater thermodynamic temperature and absolute
pressure; that is, a pressure of 320Â kPa-absolute, which is 220Â kPa-gage.
***** Definition of thermodynamic temperature[edit] *****
The thermodynamic temperature is defined by the ideal_gas_law and its
consequences. It can be linked also to the second law of thermodynamics. The
thermodynamic temperature can be shown to have special properties, and in
particular can be seen to be uniquely defined (up to some constant
multiplicative factor) by considering the efficiency of idealized heat_engines.
Thus the ratio T2/T1 of two temperaturesT1 andT2 is the same in all absolute
scales.
Strictly speaking, the temperature of a system is well-defined only if it is at
thermal_equilibrium. From a microscopic viewpoint, a material is at thermal
equilibrium if the quantity of heat between its individual particles cancel
out. There are many possible scales of temperature, derived from a variety of
observations of physical phenomena.
Loosely stated, temperature differences dictate the direction of heat between
two systems such that their combined energy is maximally distributed among
their lowest possible states. We call this distribution "entropy". To better
understand the relationship between temperature and entropy, consider the
relationship between heat, work and temperature illustrated in the Carnot_heat
engine. The engine converts heat into work by directing a temperature gradient
between a higher temperature heat source, TH, and a lower temperature heat
sink, TC, through a gas filled piston. The work done per cycle is equal to the
difference between the heat supplied to the engine by TH, qH, and the heat
supplied to TC by the engine, qC. The efficiency of the engine is the work
divided by the heat put into the system or
           Efficiency   =    w  c y    q  H     =     q  H   &#x2212;  q  C
      q  H     = 1 &#x2212;    q  C    q  H      ( 1 )   {\displaystyle
      {\textrm {Efficiency}}={\frac {w_{cy}}{q_{H}}}={\frac {q_{H}-q_{C}}{q_
      {H}}}=1-{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}\qquad (1)}  [{\textrm {Efficiency}}={\frac
      {w_{cy}}{q_{H}}}={\frac {q_{H}-q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=1-{\frac {q_{C}}{q_
      {H}}}\qquad (1)]
where wcy is the work done per cycle. Thus the efficiency depends only on qC/
qH.
Carnot's_theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same
heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Thus, any reversible heat engine
operating between temperatures T1 and T2 must have the same efficiency, that is
to say, the efficiency is the function of only temperatures
            q  C    q  H     = f (  T  H   ,  T  C   )  ( 2 ) .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=f(T_{H},T_{C})\qquad (2).}  [{\frac
      {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=f(T_{H},T_{C})\qquad (2).]
In addition, a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures T1 and T3
must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles, one between T1
and another (intermediate) temperature T2, and the second between T2 andT3. If
this were not the case, then energy (in the form of Q) will be wasted or
gained, resulting in different overall efficiencies every time a cycle is split
into component cycles; clearly a cycle can be composed of any number of smaller
cycles.
With this understanding of Q1, Q2 and Q3, we note also that mathematically,
         f (  T  1   ,  T  3   ) =    q  3    q  1     =     q  2    q  3
      q  1    q  2      = f (  T  1   ,  T  2   ) f (  T  2   ,  T  3   ) .
      {\displaystyle f(T_{1},T_{3})={\frac {q_{3}}{q_{1}}}={\frac {q_{2}q_{3}}
      {q_{1}q_{2}}}=f(T_{1},T_{2})f(T_{2},T_{3}).}  [f(T_{1},T_{3})={\frac {q_
      {3}}{q_{1}}}={\frac {q_{2}q_{3}}{q_{1}q_{2}}}=f(T_{1},T_{2})f(T_{2},T_
      {3}).]
But the first function is NOT a function of T2, therefore the product of the
final two functions MUST result in the removal of T2 as a variable. The only
way is therefore to define the function f as follows:
         f (  T  1   ,  T  2   ) =    g (  T  2   )   g (  T  1   )    .
      {\displaystyle f(T_{1},T_{2})={\frac {g(T_{2})}{g(T_{1})}}.}  [f(T_{1},T_
      {2})={\frac {g(T_{2})}{g(T_{1})}}.]
and
         f (  T  2   ,  T  3   ) =    g (  T  3   )   g (  T  2   )    .
      {\displaystyle f(T_{2},T_{3})={\frac {g(T_{3})}{g(T_{2})}}.}  [f(T_{2},T_
      {3})={\frac {g(T_{3})}{g(T_{2})}}.]
so that
         f (  T  1   ,  T  3   ) =    g (  T  3   )   g (  T  1   )    =    q
      3    q  1     .   {\displaystyle f(T_{1},T_{3})={\frac {g(T_{3})}{g(T_
      {1})}}={\frac {q_{3}}{q_{1}}}.}  [f(T_{1},T_{3})={\frac {g(T_{3})}{g(T_
      {1})}}={\frac {q_{3}}{q_{1}}}.]
i.e. The ratio of heat exchanged is a function of the respective temperatures
at which they occur. We can choose any monotonic function for our     g ( T )
{\displaystyle g(T)}  [g(T)]; it is a matter of convenience and convention that
we choose     g ( T ) = T   {\displaystyle g(T)=T}  [g(T)=T]. Choosing then one
fixed reference temperature (i.e. triple point of water), we establish the
thermodynamic temperature scale.
It is to be noted that such a definition coincides with that of the ideal gas
derivation; also it is this definition of the thermodynamic temperature that
enables us to represent the Carnot efficiency in terms of TH and TC, and hence
derive that the (complete) Carnot cycle is isentropic:
            q  C    q  H     = f (  T  H   ,  T  C   ) =    T  C    T  H     .
      ( 3 ) .   {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=f(T_{H},T_{C})={\frac {T_
      {C}}{T_{H}}}.\qquad (3).}  [{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=f(T_{H},T_{C})={\frac
      {T_{C}}{T_{H}}}.\qquad (3).]
Substituting this back into our first formula for efficiency yields a
relationship in terms of temperature:
           Efficiency   = 1 &#x2212;    q  C    q  H     = 1 &#x2212;    T  C
      T  H      ( 4 ) .   {\displaystyle {\textrm {Efficiency}}=1-{\frac {q_
      {C}}{q_{H}}}=1-{\frac {T_{C}}{T_{H}}}\qquad (4).}  [{\textrm
      {Efficiency}}=1-{\frac {q_{C}}{q_{H}}}=1-{\frac {T_{C}}{T_{H}}}\qquad
      (4).]
Notice that for TC=0 the efficiency is 100% and that efficiency becomes greater
than 100% for TC<0, which cases are unrealistic. Subtracting the right hand
side of Equation 4 from the middle portion and rearranging gives
            q  H    T  H     &#x2212;    q  C    T  C     = 0 ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {q_{H}}{T_{H}}}-{\frac {q_{C}}{T_{C}}}=0,}  [{\frac
      {q_{H}}{T_{H}}}-{\frac {q_{C}}{T_{C}}}=0,]
where the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the system. The
generalization of this equation is Clausius_theorem, which suggests the
existence of a state_function S (i.e., a function which depends only on the
state of the system, not on how it reached that state) defined (up to an
additive constant) by
         d S =    d  q   r e v     T    ( 5 ) ,   {\displaystyle dS={\frac {dq_
      {\mathrm {rev} }}{T}}\qquad (5),}  [dS={\frac {dq_{\mathrm {rev} }}
      {T}}\qquad (5),]
where the subscript indicates heat transfer in a reversible process. The
function S corresponds to the entropy of the system, mentioned previously, and
the change of S around any cycle is zero (as is necessary for any state
function). Equation 5 can be rearranged to get an alternative definition for
temperature in terms of entropy and heat (to avoid logic loop, we should first
define entropy through statistical mechanics):
         T =    d  q   r e v      d S    .   {\displaystyle T={\frac {dq_
      {\mathrm {rev} }}{dS}}.}  [T={\frac {dq_{\mathrm {rev} }}{dS}}.]
For a system in which the entropy S is a function S(E) of its energy E, the
thermodynamic temperature T is therefore given by
           1 T   =    d S   d E    ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{T}}={\frac
      {dS}{dE}},}  [{\frac {1}{T}}={\frac {dS}{dE}},]
so that the reciprocal of the thermodynamic temperature is the rate of increase
of entropy with energy.
***** History[edit] *****
    * Ca. 485 BC:
      Parmenides
      Parmenides in his treatise "On Nature" postulated the existence of primum
      frigidum, a hypothetical elementary substance source of all cooling or
      cold in the world.[36]
    * 1702Ã¢Â€Â“1703:
      Guillaume_Amontons
      Guillaume_Amontons (1663Ã¢Â€Â“1705) published two papers that may be used to
      credit him as being the first researcher to deduce the existence of a
      fundamental (thermodynamic) temperature scale featuring an absolute zero.
      He made the discovery while endeavoring to improve upon the air
      thermometers in use at the time. His J-tube thermometers comprised a
      mercury column that was supported by a fixed mass of air entrapped within
      the sensing portion of the thermometer. In thermodynamic terms, his
      thermometers relied upon the volume / temperature relationship of gas
      under constant pressure. His measurements of the boiling point of water
      and the melting point of ice showed that regardless of the mass of air
      trapped inside his thermometers or the weight of mercury the air was
      supporting, the reduction in air volume at the ice point was always the
      same ratio. This observation led him to posit that a sufficient reduction
      in temperature would reduce the air volume to zero. In fact, his
      calculations projected that absolute zero was equivalent to
      Ã¢ÂˆÂ’240Â Ã‚Â°CÃ¢Â€Â”only 33.15 degrees short of the true value of Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C.
    * 1742:
      Anders_Celsius
      Anders_Celsius (1701Ã¢Â€Â“1744) created a "backwards" version of the modern
      Celsius temperature scale. In Celsius's original scale, zero represented
      the boiling point of water and 100 represented the melting point of ice.
      In his paper Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer, he
      recounted his experiments showing that ice's melting point was
      effectively unaffected by pressure. He also determined with remarkable
      precision how water's boiling point varied as a function of atmospheric
      pressure. He proposed that zero on his temperature scale (water's boiling
      point) would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea
      level.
    * 1744:
      Carl_Linnaeus
      Coincident with the death of Anders Celsius, the famous botanist Carl
      Linnaeus (1707Ã¢Â€Â“1778) effectively reversed[37] Celsius's scale upon
      receipt of his first thermometer featuring a scale where zero represented
      the melting point of ice and 100 represented water's boiling point. The
      custom-made linnaeus-thermometer, for use in his greenhouses, was made by
      Daniel EkstrÃƒÂ¶m, Sweden's leading maker of scientific instruments at the
      time. For the next 204 years, the scientific and thermometry communities
      worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade_scale. Temperatures on
      the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or, when
      greater specificity was desired, degrees_centigrade. The symbol for
      temperature values on this scale was Ã‚Â°C (in several formats over the
      years). Because the term centigrade was also the French-language name for
      a unit of angular measurement (one-hundredth of a right angle) and had a
      similar connotation in other languages, the term "centesimal_degree" was
      used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by
      international standards bodies such as the International_Bureau_of
      Weights_and_Measures (Bureau international des poids et mesures) (BIPM).
      The 9th CGPM (General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures (ConfÃƒÂ©rence
      gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale des poids et mesures) and the CIPM (International_Committee
      for_Weights_and_Measures (ComitÃƒÂ© international des poids et mesures)
      formally adopted[38] degree_Celsius (symbol: Ã‚Â°C) in 1948.[39]
    * 1777:
      Johann_Heinrich_Lambert
      In his book Pyrometrie (Berlin: Haude_&_Spener, 1779) completed four
      months before his death, Johann_Heinrich_Lambert (1728Ã¢Â€Â“1777), sometimes
      incorrectly referred to as Joseph Lambert, proposed an absolute
      temperature scale based on the pressure/temperature relationship of a
      fixed volume of gas. This is distinct from the volume/temperature
      relationship of gas under constant pressure that Guillaume Amontons
      discovered 75 years earlier. Lambert stated that absolute zero was the
      point where a simple straight-line extrapolation reached zero gas
      pressure and was equal to Ã¢ÂˆÂ’270Â Ã‚Â°C.
    * Circa 1787:
      Jacques_Alexandre_CÃƒÂ©sar_Charles
      Notwithstanding the work of Guillaume Amontons 85 years earlier, Jacques
      Alexandre_CÃƒÂ©sar_Charles (1746Ã¢Â€Â“1823) is often credited with
      discovering, but not publishing, that the volume of a gas under constant
      pressure is proportional to its absolute temperature. The formula he
      created was V1/T1Â =Â V2/T2.
    * 1802:
      Joseph_Louis_Gay-Lussac
      Joseph_Louis_Gay-Lussac (1778Ã¢Â€Â“1850) published work (acknowledging the
      unpublished lab notes of Jacques Charles fifteen years earlier)
      describing how the volume of gas under constant pressure changes linearly
      with its absolute (thermodynamic) temperature. This behavior is called
      Charles's_Law and is one of the gas_laws. His are the first known
      formulas to use the number 273 for the expansion coefficient of gas
      relative to the melting point of ice (indicating that absolute zero was
      equivalent to Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273Â Ã‚Â°C).
    * 1848:
      Lord_Kelvin
      William_Thomson, (1824Ã¢Â€Â“1907) also known as Lord Kelvin, wrote in his
      paper, On_an_Absolute_Thermometric_Scale, of the need for a scale whereby
      infinite cold (absolute zero) was the scale's null point, and which used
      the degree Celsius for its unit increment. Like Gay-Lussac, Thomson
      calculated that absolute zero was equivalent to Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273Â Ã‚Â°C on the air
      thermometers of the time. This absolute scale is known today as the
      kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale. It's noteworthy that Thomson's
      value of Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273 was actually derived from 0.00366, which was the accepted
      expansion coefficient of gas per degree Celsius relative to the ice
      point. The inverse of Ã¢ÂˆÂ’0.00366 expressed to five significant digits is
      Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.22Â Ã‚Â°C which is remarkably close to the true value of
      Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C.
    * 1859:
      William_John_Macquorn_Rankine
      William_John_Macquorn_Rankine (1820Ã¢Â€Â“1872) proposed a thermodynamic
      temperature scale similar to William Thomson's but which used the degree
      Fahrenheit for its unit increment. This absolute scale is known today as
      the Rankine thermodynamic temperature scale.
    * 1877Ã¢Â€Â“1884:
      Ludwig_Boltzmann
      Ludwig_Boltzmann (1844Ã¢Â€Â“1906) made major contributions to thermodynamics
      through an understanding of the role that particle kinetics and black
      body radiation played. His name is now attached to several of the
      formulas used today in thermodynamics.
    * Circa 1930s: Gas thermometry experiments carefully calibrated to the
      melting point of ice and boiling point of water showed that absolute zero
      was equivalent to Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C.
    * 1948: Resolution_3 of the 9th CGPM (ConfÃƒÂ©rence GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale des Poids et
      Mesures, also known as the General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures)
      fixed the triple point of water at precisely 0.01Â Ã‚Â°C. At this time, the
      triple point still had no formal definition for its equivalent kelvin
      value, which the resolution declared "will be fixed at a later date". The
      implication is that if the value of absolute zero measured in the 1930s
      was truly Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C, then the triple point of water (0.01Â Ã‚Â°C) was
      equivalent to 273.16Â K. Additionally, both the CIPM (ComitÃƒÂ©
      international des poids et mesures, also known as the International
      Committee for Weights and Measures) and the CGPM formally_adopted the
      name Celsius for the degree Celsius and the Celsius temperature scale.Â 
      [39]
    * 1954: Resolution_3 of the 10th CGPM gave the kelvin scale its modern
      definition by choosing the triple point of water as its second defining
      point and assigned it a temperature of precisely 273.16Â kelvins (what was
      actually written 273.16 degrees Kelvin at the time). This, in combination
      with Resolution 3 of the 9th CGPM, had the effect of defining absolute
      zero as being precisely zero kelvins and Ã¢ÂˆÂ’273.15Â Ã‚Â°C.
    * 1967/1968: Resolution_3 of the 13th CGPM renamed the unit increment of
      thermodynamic temperature kelvin, symbol K, replacing degree absolute,
      symbol Ã‚Â°K. Further, feeling it useful to more explicitly define the
      magnitude of the unit increment, the 13th CGPM also decided in Resolution
      4 that "The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction 1/
      273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water".
    * 2005: The CIPM (ComitÃƒÂ© International des Poids et Mesures, also known as
      the International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures) affirmed that for
      the purposes of delineating the temperature of the triple point of water,
      the definition of the kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale would refer
      to water having an isotopic composition defined as being precisely equal
      to the nominal specification of Vienna_Standard_Mean_Ocean_Water.

      Absolute zero's relationship to zero-point energy
      While scientists are achieving temperatures ever closer to absolute_zero,
      they can not fully achieve a state of zero temperature. However, even if
      scientists could remove all kinetic thermal energy from matter, quantum
      mechanical zero-point_energy (ZPE) causes particle motion that can never
      be eliminated. EncyclopÃƒÂ¦dia Britannica Online defines_zero-point energy
      as the "vibrational energy that molecules retain even at the absolute
      zero of temperature". ZPE is the result of all-pervasive energy fields in
      the vacuum between the fundamental particles of nature; it is responsible
      for the Casimir_effect and other phenomena. See Zero_Point_Energy_and
      Zero_Point_Field. See also Solid_Helium Archived 2008-02-12 at the
      Wayback_Machine by the University of Alberta's Department of Physics to
      learn more about ZPE's effect on BoseÃ¢Â€Â“Einstein_condensates of helium.
      Although absolute zero (T=0) is not a state of zero molecular motion, it
      isÂ the point of zero temperature and, in accordance with the Boltzmann
      constant, is also the point of zero particle kinetic energy and zero
      kinetic velocity. To understand how atoms can have zero kinetic velocity
      and simultaneously be vibrating due to ZPE, consider the following
      thought experiment: two T=0 helium atoms in zero gravity are carefully
      positioned and observed to have an average separation of 620Â pm between
      them (a gap of ten atomic diameters). It's an "average" separation
      because ZPE causes them to jostle about their fixed positions. Then one
      atom is given a kinetic kick of precisely 83Â yoctokelvins (1Â yK =
      1ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’24Â K). This is done in a way that directs this atom's velocity
      vector at the other atom. With 83Â yK of kinetic energy between them, the
      620 pm gap through their common barycenter would close at a rate of
      719Â pm/s and they would collide after 0.862 second. This is the same
      speed as shown in the Fig.Â 1animation above. Before being given the
      kinetic kick, both T=0 atoms had zero kinetic energy and zero kinetic
      velocity because they could persist indefinitely in that state and
      relative orientation even though both were being jostled by ZPE. At T=0,
      no kinetic energy is available for transfer to other systems. The
      Boltzmann constant and its related formulas describe the realm of
      particle kinetics and velocity vectors whereas ZPE is an energy field
      that jostles particles in ways described by the mathematics of quantum
      mechanics. In atomic and molecular collisions in gases, ZPE introduces a
      degree of chaos, i.e., unpredictability, to rebound kinetics; it is as
      likely that there will be less ZPE-induced particle motion after a given
      collision as more. This random nature of ZPE is why it has no net effect
      upon either the pressure or volume of any bulk quantity (a statistically
      significant quantity of particles) of T>0Â K gases. However, in T=0
      condensed_matter; e.g., solids and liquids, ZPE causes inter-atomic
      jostling where atoms would otherwise be perfectly stationary. Inasmuch as
      the real-world effects that ZPE has on substances can vary as one alters
      a thermodynamic system (for example, due to ZPE, helium won't freeze
      unless under a pressure of at least 25Â bar or 2.5 MPa), ZPE is very much
      a form of thermal energy and may properly be included when tallying a
      substance's internal energy.
      Note too that absolute zero serves as the baseline atop which
      thermodynamics and its equations are founded because they deal with the
      exchange of thermal energy between "systems" (a plurality of particles
      and fields modeled as an average). Accordingly, one may examine ZPE-
      induced particle motion within a system that is at absolute zero but
      there can never be a net outflow of thermal energy from such a system.
      Also, the peak emittance wavelength of black-body radiation shifts to
      infinity at absolute zero; indeed, a peak no longer exists and black-body
      photons can no longer escape. Because of ZPE, however, virtual photons
      are still emitted at T=0. Such photons are called "virtual" because they
      can't be intercepted and observed. Furthermore, this zero-point radiation
      has a unique zero-point spectrum. However, even though a T=0 system emits
      zero-point radiation, no net heat flow Q out of such a system can occur
      because if the surrounding environment is at a temperature greater than
      T=0, heat will flow inward, and if the surrounding environment is at T=0,
      there will be an equal flux of ZP radiation both inward and outward. A
      similar Qequilibrium exists at T=0 with the ZPE-induced spontaneous
      emission of photons (which is more properly called a stimulated emission
      in this context). The graph at upper right illustrates the relationship
      of absolute zero to zero-point energy. The graph also helps in the
      understanding of how zero-point energy got its name: it is the
      vibrational energy matter retains at the zero-kelvin point. Derivation_of

   4. ^ At non-relativistic temperatures of less than about 30Â GK, classical
      mechanics are sufficient to calculate the velocity of particles. At
      30Â GK, individual neutrons (the constituent of neutron stars and one of
      the few materials in the universe with temperatures in this range) have a
      1.0042 ÃÂ³ (gamma or Lorentz_factor). Thus, the classic Newtonian formula
      for kinetic energy is in error less than half a percent for temperatures
      less than 30Â GK.
   5. ^ Even roomÃ¢Â€Â“temperature air has an average molecular translational
      speed (not vector-isolated velocity) of 1822Â km/hour. This is relatively
      fast for something the size of a molecule considering there are roughly
      2.42ÃƒÂ—1016 of them crowded into a single cubic millimeter. Assumptions:
      Average molecular weight of wet air = 28.838 g/mol and T = 296.15Â K.
      Assumption's primary variables: An altitude of 194 meters above mean sea
      level (the worldÃ¢Â€Â“wide median altitude of human habitation), an indoor
      temperature of 23Â Ã‚Â°C, a dewpoint of 9Â Ã‚Â°C (40.85% relative humidity),
      and 760Â mmHg (101.325 kPa) sea levelÃ¢Â€Â“corrected barometric pressure.

      PhysRevLett.74.1542. It's noteworthy that a record cold temperature of
      450Â pK in a BoseÃ¢Â€Â“Einstein condensate of sodium atoms (achieved by A. E.
      Leanhardt et al.. of MIT) equates to an average vector-isolated atom
      velocity of 0.4Â mm/s and an average atom speed of 0.7Â mm/s.
   7. ^ a b The rate of translational motion of atoms and molecules is
      calculated based on thermodynamic temperature as follows:
                  v &#x00AF;    =      k  B   T  m      {\displaystyle {\bar
            {v}}={\sqrt {\frac {k_{B}T}{m}}}}  [{\bar {v}}={\sqrt {\frac {k_
            {B}T}{m}}}]
      where:
          o       v &#x00AF;      {\displaystyle {\bar {v}}}  [{\bar {v}}] is
            the vector-isolated mean velocity of translational particle motion
            in m/s
          o kB is the Boltzmann_constant = 1.3806504(24)ÃƒÂ—10Ã¢ÂˆÂ’23Â J/K
          o T is the thermodynamic temperature in kelvins
          o m is the molecular mass of substance in kilograms
      In the above formula, molecular mass, m, in kilograms per particle is the
      quotient of a substance's molar_mass (also known as atomic weight, atomic
      mass, relative atomic mass, and unified_atomic_mass_units) in g/mol or
      daltons divided by 6.02214179(30)ÃƒÂ—1026 (which is the Avogadro_constant
      times one thousand). For diatomic molecules such as H2, N2, and O2,
      multiply atomic weight by two before plugging it into the above formula.
      The mean speed (not vector-isolated velocity) of an atom or molecule
      along any arbitrary path is calculated as follows:
                  s &#x00AF;    =    v &#x00AF;      3     {\displaystyle {\bar
            {s}}={\bar {v}}{\sqrt {3}}}  [{\bar {s}}={\bar {v}}{\sqrt {3}}]
      where:
          o       s &#x00AF;      {\displaystyle {\bar {s}}}  [{\bar {s}}] is
            the mean speed of translational particle motion in m/s
      Note that the mean energy of the translational motions of a substance's
      constituent particles correlates to their mean speed, not velocity. Thus,
      substituting        s &#x00AF;      {\displaystyle {\bar {s}}}  [{\bar
      {s}}] for v in the classic formula for kinetic energy,
      EkÂ =Â &#x200b;1â„2mÂ Ã¢Â€Â¢Â vÂ 2 produces precisely the same value as does
      EmeanÂ =Â 3/2kBT (as shown in the section titled The_nature_of_kinetic
      energy,_translational_motion,_and_temperature).Â  Note too that the
      Boltzmann constant and its related formulas establish that absolute zero
      is the point of both zero kinetic energy of particle motion and zero
      kinetic velocity (see also Note_1 above).
   8. ^ The internal degrees of freedom of molecules cause their external
      surfaces to vibrate and can also produce overall spinning motions (what
      can be likened to the jiggling and spinning of an otherwise stationary
      water balloon). If one examines a single molecule as it impacts a
      containers' wall, some of the kinetic energy borne in the molecule's
      internal degrees of freedom can constructively add to its translational
      motion during the instant of the collision and extra kinetic energy will
      be transferred into the container's wall. This would induce an extra,
      localized, impulse-like contribution to the average pressure on the
      container. However, since the internal motions of molecules are random,
      they have an equal probability of destructively interfering with
      translational motion during a collision with a container's walls or
      another molecule. Averaged across any bulk quantity of a gas, the
      internal thermal motions of molecules have zero net effect upon the
      temperature, pressure, or volume of a gas. Molecules' internal degrees of
      freedom simply provide additional locations where internal energy is
      stored. This is precisely why molecular-based gases have greater specific
      heat capacity than monatomic gases (where additional thermal energy must
      be added to achieve a given temperature rise).

  10. ^ The speed at which thermal energy equalizes throughout the volume of a
      gas is very rapid. However, since gases have extremely low density
      relative to solids, the heat flux (the thermal power passing per area)
      through gases is comparatively low. This is why the dead-air spaces in
      multi-pane_windows have insulating qualities.

      thermonuclear weapon of the TellerÃ¢Â€Â“Ulam configuration (commonly known
      as a Ã¢Â€Âœhydrogen bombÃ¢Â€Â). Peak temperatures in Gadget-style fission bomb

      wherein high Ã¢Â€ÂœtemperatureÃ¢Â€Â applies only to the debris from two

  20. ^ BasedÂ on a computer model that predicted a peak internal temperature of
      30 MeV (350Â GK) during the merger of a binary neutron star system (which
      produces a gammaÃ¢Â€Â“ray burst). The neutron stars in the model were 1.2
      and 1.6 solar masses respectively, were roughly 20Â km in diameter, and
      were orbiting around their barycenter (common center of mass) at about
      390Â Hz during the last several milliseconds before they completely
      merged. The 350Â GK portion was a small volume located at the pairÃ¢Â€Â™s
      developing common core and varied from roughly 1 to 7Â km across over a
      time span of around 5Â ms. Imagine two city-sized objects of unimaginable
      density orbiting each other at the same frequency as the G4 musical note
      (the 28th white key on a piano). ItÃ¢Â€Â™s also noteworthy that at 350 GK,
      the average neutron has a vibrational speed of 30% the speed of light and
      a relativistic mass (m) 5% greater than its rest mass (m0).Â  Citation:

      reciprocal of one Planck time). Photons at the Planck frequency have a
      wavelength of one Planck length. The Planck temperature of 1.416Â 79

  30. ^ Â Mobile conduction electrons are delocalized, i.e. not tied to a
      specific atom, and behave rather like a sort of quantum gas due to the
      effects of zero-point energy. Consequently, even at absolute zero,
      conduction electrons still move between atoms at the Fermi velocity of
      about 1.6ÃƒÂ—106Â m/s. Kinetic thermal energy adds to this speed and also
      causes delocalized electrons to travel farther away from the nuclei.
  31. ^ No other crystal_structure can exceed the 74.048% packing density of a
      closest-packed arrangement.Â  The two regular crystal lattices found in
      nature that have this density are hexagonal_close_packed (HCP) and face-
      centered_cubic (FCC). These regular lattices are at the lowest possible
      energy state. Diamond is a closest-packed structure with an FCC crystal
      lattice. Note too that suitable crystalline chemical compounds, although
      usually composed of atoms of different sizes, can be considered as
      closest-packed structures when considered at the molecular level. One
      such compound is the common mineral known as magnesium aluminum spinel
      (MgAl2O4). It has a face-centered cubic crystal lattice and no change in
      pressure can produce a lattice with a lower energy state.
  32. ^ Nearly half of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements that can
      freeze under a vacuum also have a closest-packed crystal lattice. This
      set includes beryllium, osmium, neon, and iridium (but excludes helium),
      and therefore have zero latent heat of phase transitions to contribute to
      internal energy (symbol: U). In the calculation of enthalpy (formula:
      HÂ =Â UÂ +Â pV), internal energy may exclude different sources of thermal
      energy (particularly ZPE) depending on the nature of the analysis.
      Accordingly, all T=0 closest-packed matter under a perfect vacuum has
      either minimal or zero enthalpy, depending on the nature of the analysis.

  33. ^ Pressure also must be in absolute terms. The air still in a tire at
      0Â kPa-gage expands too as it gets hotter. It's not uncommon for engineers
      to overlook that one must work in terms of absolute pressure when
      compensating for temperature. For instance, a dominant manufacturer of
      aircraft tires published a document on temperature-compensating tire
      pressure, which used gage pressure in the formula. However, the high gage
      pressures involved (180Â psi; 12.4 bar; 1.24 MPa) means the error would be
      quite small. With low-pressure automobile tires, where gage pressures are
      typically around 2 bar (200 kPa), failing to adjust to absolute pressure
      results in a significant error. Referenced document: Aircraft Tire
      Ratings (155Â kB_PDF,_here).
  34. ^ Regarding the spelling "gage" vs. "gauge" in the context of pressures
      measured relative to atmospheric pressure, the preferred spelling varies
      by country and even by industry. Further, both spellings are often used
      within a particular industry or country. Industries in British English-
      speaking countries typically use the spelling "gauge pressure" to
      distinguish it from the pressure-measuring instrument, which in the U.K.,
      is spelled pressure gage. For the same reason, many of the largest
      American manufacturers of pressure transducers and instrumentation use
      the spelling gage pressure (the convention used here) in their formal
      documentation to distinguish it from the instrument, which is spelled
      pressure gauge. (see Honeywell-Sensotec's FAQ_page and Fluke
      Corporation's product_search_page).
  35. ^ A difference of 100Â kPa is used here instead of the 101.325Â kPa value
      of one standard_atmosphere. In 1982, the International_Union_of_Pure_and
      Applied_Chemistry (IUPAC) recommended that for the purposes of specifying
      the physical properties of substances, the standard pressure (atmospheric
      pressure) should be defined as precisely 100Â kPa (Ã¢Â‰Âˆ750.062Â Torr).
      Besides being a round number, this had a very practical effect:
      relatively few people live and work at precisely sea level; 100Â kPa
      equates to the mean pressure at an altitude of about 112 meters, which is
      closer to the 194Ã¢Â€Â“meter, worldwide median altitude of human habitation.
      For especially low-pressure or high-accuracy work, true atmospheric
      pressure must be measured. Citation: IUPAC.org, Gold Book, Standard

  39. ^ a b According to The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the term
      "Celsius's thermometer" had been used at least as early as 1797. Further,
      the term "The Celsius or Centigrade thermometer" was again used in
      reference to a particular type of thermometer at least as early as 1850.
      The OED also cites this 1928 reporting of a temperature: "My altitude was
      about 5,800 metres, the temperature was 28Ã‚Â° Celsius". However,
      dictionaries seek to find the earliest use of a word or term and are not
      a useful resource as regards the terminology used throughout the history
      of science. According to several writings of Dr. Terry Quinn CBE FRS,
      Director of the BIPM (1988Ã¢Â€Â“2004), including Temperature Scales from the
      early days of thermometry to the 21st century (148Â kB_PDF,_here) as well
      as Temperature (2nd Edition / 1990 / Academic Press / 0125696817), the
      term Celsius in connection with the centigrade scale was not used
      whatsoever by the scientific or thermometry communities until after the
      CIPM and CGPM adopted the term in 1948. The BIPM wasn't even aware that
      degree Celsius was in sporadic, non-scientific use before that time. It's
      also noteworthy that the twelve-volume, 1933 edition of OED did not even
      have a listing for the word Celsius (but did have listings for both
      centigrade and centesimal in the context of temperature measurement). The
      1948 adoption of Celsius accomplished three objectives:
         1. All common temperature scales would have their units named after
            someone closely associated with them; namely, Kelvin, Celsius,
            Fahrenheit, RÃƒÂ©aumur and Rankine.
         2. Notwithstanding the important contribution of Linnaeus who gave the
            Celsius scale its modern form, Celsius's name was the obvious
            choice because it began with the letter C. Thus, the symbol Ã‚Â°C
            that for centuries had been used in association with the name
            centigrade could continue to be used and would simultaneously
            inherit an intuitive association with the new name.
         3. The new name eliminated the ambiguity of the term centigrade,
            freeing it to refer exclusively to the French-language name for the
            unit of angular measurement.
