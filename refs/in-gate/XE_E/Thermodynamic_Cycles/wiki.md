A thermodynamic cycle consists of a linked sequence of thermodynamic_processes
that involve transfer_of_heat and work into and out of the system, while
varying pressure, temperature, and other state_variables within the system, and
that eventually returns the system to its initial state.[1] In the process of
passing through a cycle, the working fluid (system) may convert heat from a
warm source into useful work, and dispose of the remaining heat to a cold sink,
thereby acting as a heat_engine. Conversely, the cycle may be reversed and use
work to move heat from a cold source and transfer it to a warm sink thereby
acting as a heat_pump. At every point in the cycle, the system is in
thermodynamic_equilibrium, so the cycle is reversible (its entropy change is
zero, as entropy is a state function).
During a closed cycle, the system returns to its original thermodynamic state
of temperature and pressure. Process_quantities (or path quantities), such as
heat and work are process dependent. For a cycle for which the system returns
to its initial state the first law of thermodynamics applies:
         &#x0394; E =  E  o u t   &#x2212;  E  i n   = 0   {\displaystyle
      \Delta E=E_{out}-E_{in}=0}  [\Delta E=E_{out}-E_{in}=0]
The above states that there is no change of the energy of the system over the
cycle. Ein might be the work and heat input during the cycle and Eout would be
the work and heat output during the cycle. The first_law_of_thermodynamics also
dictates that the net heat input is equal to the net work output over a cycle
(we account for heat, Qin, as positive and Qout as negative). The repeating
nature of the process path allows for continuous operation, making the cycle an
important concept in thermodynamics. Thermodynamic cycles are often represented
mathematically as quasistatic_processes in the modeling of the workings of an
actual device.

***** Heat and work[edit] *****
Two primary classes of thermodynamic cycles are power cycles and heat pump
cycles. Power cycles are cycles which convert some heat input into a mechanical
work output, while heat pump cycles transfer heat from low to high temperatures
by using mechanical work as the input. Cycles composed entirely of quasistatic
processes can operate as power or heat pump cycles by controlling the process
direction. On a pressureâvolume_(PV)_diagram or temperatureâentropy
diagram, the clockwise_and_counterclockwise directions indicate power and heat
pump cycles, respectively.
**** Relationship to work[edit] ****
The net work equals the area inside because it is (a) the Riemann sum of work
done on the substance due to expansion, minus (b) the work done to re-compress.
Because the net variation in state properties during a thermodynamic cycle is
zero, it forms a closed loop on a PV_diagram. A PV diagram's Y axis shows
pressure (P) and X axis shows volume (V). The area enclosed by the loop is the
work (W) done by the process:
          (1)   W =    &#x222E;      &#x2061; P &#xA0; d V   {\displaystyle
      {\text{(1)}}\qquad W=\oint P\ dV}  [{\text{(1)}}\qquad W=\oint P\ dV]
This work is equal to the balance of heat (Q) transferred into the system:
          (2)   W = Q =  Q  i n   &#x2212;  Q  o u t     {\displaystyle {\text{
      (2)}}\qquad W=Q=Q_{in}-Q_{out}}  [{\text{(2)}}\qquad W=Q=Q_{in}-Q_{out}]
Equation (2) makes a cyclic process similar to an isothermal_process: even
though the internal energy changes during the course of the cyclic process,
when the cyclic process finishes the system's energy is the same as the energy
it had when the process began.
If the cyclic process moves clockwise around the loop, then W will be positive,
and it represents a heat_engine. If it moves counterclockwise, then W will be
negative, and it represents a heat_pump.

      not exclude energy transfer as heat or work.
    * Isentropic : The process is one of constant entropy (S=constant, Î´S=0).
      This excludes the transfer of heat but not work.

Thermodynamic power cycles are the basis for the operation of heat engines,
which supply most of the world's electric_power and run the vast majority of
motor_vehicles. Power cycles can be organized into two categories: real cycles
and ideal cycles. Cycles encountered in real world devices (real cycles) are
difficult to analyze because of the presence of complicating effects
(friction), and the absence of sufficient time for the establishment of
equilibrium conditions. For the purpose of analysis and design, idealized
models (ideal cycles) are created; these ideal models allow engineers to study
the effects of major parameters that dominate the cycle without having to spend
significant time working out intricate details present in the real cycle model.
Power cycles can also be divided according to the type of heat engine they seek
to model. The most common cycles used to model internal_combustion_engines are
the Otto_cycle, which models gasoline_engines, and the Diesel_cycle, which
models diesel_engines. Cycles that model external_combustion_engines include
the Brayton_cycle, which models gas_turbines, the Rankine_cycle, which models
steam_turbines, the Stirling_cycle, which models hot_air_engines, and the
Ericsson_cycle, which also models hot air engines.
The clockwise thermodynamic cycle indicated by the arrows shows that the cycle
represents a heat engine. The cycle consists of four states (the point shown by
crosses) and four thermodynamic processes (lines).
For example, the pressure-volume mechanical_work output from the ideal Stirling
cycle (net work out), consisting of 4 thermodynamic processes, is[citation

For the ideal Stirling cycle, no volume change happens in process 4-1 and 2-3,
thus equation (3) simplifies to:
          (4)    W   n e t    =  W  1 &#x2192; 2   +  W  3 &#x2192; 4
      {\displaystyle {\text{(4)}}\qquad W_{\rm {net}}=W_{1\to 2}+W_{3\to 4}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\text{(4)}}\qquad W_{\rm {net}}=W_{1\to 2}+W_{3\to 4}}]
**** Heat pump cycles[edit] ****
Main article: Heat_pump_and_refrigeration_cycle
Thermodynamic heat pump cycles are the models for household heat_pumps and
refrigerators. There is no difference between the two except the purpose of the
refrigerator is to cool a very small space while the household heat pump is
intended to warm a house. Both work by moving heat from a cold space to a warm
space. The most common refrigeration cycle is the vapor_compression_cycle,
which models systems using refrigerants that change phase. The absorption
refrigeration_cycle is an alternative that absorbs the refrigerant in a liquid
solution rather than evaporating it. Gas refrigeration cycles include the
reversed Brayton cycle and the HampsonâLinde_cycle. Multiple compression and
expansion cycles allow gas refrigeration systems to liquify_gases.
***** Modeling real systems[edit] *****
 Example of a real system modelled by an idealized process: PV and TS diagrams
 of a Brayton cycle mapped to actual processes of a gas turbine engine
Thermodynamic cycles may be used to model real devices and systems, typically
by making a series of assumptions.[2] simplifying assumptions are often
necessary to reduce the problem to a more manageable form.[2] For example, as
shown in the figure, devices such a gas_turbine or jet_engine can be modeled as
a Brayton_cycle. The actual device is made up of a series of stages, each of
which is itself modeled as an idealized thermodynamic process. Although each
stage which acts on the working fluid is a complex real device, they may be
modelled as idealized processes which approximate their real behavior. If
energy is added by means other than combustion, then a further assumption is
that the exhaust gases would be passed from the exhaust to a heat exchanger
that would sink the waste heat to the environment and the working gas would be
reused at the inlet stage.
The difference between an idealized cycle and actual performance may be
significant.[2] For example, the following images illustrate the differences in
work output predicted by an ideal Stirling_cycle and the actual performance of
a Stirling engine:
[Stirling_Cycle.svg] [PV_plot_adiab_sim.png] [PV_real1.PNG]
Ideal Stirling cycle Actual performance      Actual and ideal overlaid, showing
                                             difference in work output
As the net work output for a cycle is represented by the interior of the cycle,
there is a significant difference between the predicted work output of the
ideal cycle and the actual work output shown by a real engine. It may also be
observed that the real individual processes diverge from their idealized
counterparts; e.g., isochoric expansion (process 1-2) occurs with some actual
volume change.
***** Well-known thermodynamic cycles[edit] *****
In practice, simple idealized thermodynamic cycles are usually made out of four
thermodynamic_processes. Any thermodynamic processes may be used. However, when
idealized cycles are modeled, often processes where one state variable is kept
constant are used, such as an isothermal_process (constant temperature),
isobaric_process (constant pressure), isochoric_process (constant volume),
isentropic_process (constant entropy), or an isenthalpic_process (constant
enthalpy). Often adiabatic_processes are also used, where no heat is exchanged.

An illustration of an ideal cycle heat engine (arrows clockwise).
An ideal cycle is constructed out of:
   1. TOP and BOTTOM of the loop: a pair of parallel isobaric processes
   2. LEFT and RIGHT of the loop: a pair of parallel isochoric processes
Internal energy of a perfect gas undergoing different portions of a cycle:
Isothermal:     &#x0394; U = R T ln &#x2061;    V  2    V  1     &#x2212; R T
ln &#x2061;    V  2    V  1     = 0  &#xA0;(Note: U of an isothermal process
has to equal 0)    {\displaystyle \Delta U=RT\ln {\frac {V_{2}}{V_{1}}}-RT\ln
{\frac {V_{2}}{V_{1}}}=0{\text{ (Note: U of an isothermal process has to equal
0)}}}  [\Delta U=RT\ln {\frac {V_{2}}{V_{1}}}-RT\ln {\frac {V_{2}}{V_{1}}}=0
{\text{ (Note: U of an isothermal process has to equal 0)}}]
Isochoric:     &#x0394; U =  C  v   &#x0394; T &#x2212; 0 =  C  v   &#x0394; T
{\displaystyle \Delta U=C_{v}\Delta T-0=C_{v}\Delta T}  [\Delta U=C_{v}\Delta
T-0=C_{v}\Delta T]
Isobaric:     &#x0394; U =  C  p   &#x0394; T &#x2212; R &#x0394; T
(  &#xA0;or&#xA0;  P &#x0394; V ) =  C  v   &#x0394; T   {\displaystyle \Delta
U=C_{p}\Delta T-R\Delta T({\text{ or }}P\Delta V)=C_{v}\Delta T}  [\Delta U=C_
{p}\Delta T-R\Delta T({\text{ or }}P\Delta V)=C_{v}\Delta T]
**** Carnot cycle[edit] ****
Main article: Carnot_cycle
The Carnot_cycle is a cycle composed of the totally reversible_processes of
isentropic compression and expansion and isothermal heat addition and
rejection. The thermal_efficiency of a Carnot cycle depends only on the
absolute temperatures of the two reservoirs in which heat transfer takes place,
and for a power cycle is:
         &#x03B7; = 1 &#x2212;    T  L    T  H       {\displaystyle \eta =1-
      {\frac {T_{L}}{T_{H}}}}  [\eta =1-{\frac {T_{L}}{T_{H}}}]
where       T  L      {\displaystyle {T_{L}}}  [{T_{L}}] is the lowest cycle
temperature and       T  H      {\displaystyle {T_{H}}}  [{T_{H}}] the highest.
For Carnot power cycles the coefficient_of_performance for a heat_pump is:
         &#xA0; C O P = 1 +    T  L     T  H   &#x2212;  T  L
      {\displaystyle \ COP=1+{\frac {T_{L}}{T_{H}-T_{L}}}}  [\ COP=1+{\frac {T_
      {L}}{T_{H}-T_{L}}}]
and for a refrigerator the coefficient of performance is:
         &#xA0; C O P =    T  L     T  H   &#x2212;  T  L        {\displaystyle
      \ COP={\frac {T_{L}}{T_{H}-T_{L}}}}  [\ COP={\frac {T_{L}}{T_{H}-T_{L}}}]
The second law of thermodynamics limits the efficiency and COP for all cyclic
devices to levels at or below the Carnot efficiency. The Stirling_cycle and
Ericsson_cycle are two other reversible cycles that use regeneration to obtain
isothermal heat transfer.
**** Stirling cycle[edit] ****
Main article: Stirling_cycle
A Stirling cycle is like an Otto cycle, except that the adiabats are replaced
by isotherms. It is also the same as an Ericsson cycle with the isobaric
processes substituted for constant volume processes.
   1. TOP and BOTTOM of the loop: a pair of quasi-parallel isothermal processes
   2. LEFT and RIGHT sides of the loop: a pair of parallel isochoric processes
Heat flows into the loop through the top isotherm and the left isochore, and
some of this heat flows back out through the bottom isotherm and the right
isochore, but most of the heat flow is through the pair of isotherms. This
makes sense since all the work done by the cycle is done by the pair of
isothermal processes, which are described by Q=W. This suggests that all the
net heat comes in through the top isotherm. In fact, all of the heat which
comes in through the left isochore comes out through the right isochore: since
the top isotherm is all at the same warmer temperature      T  H
{\displaystyle T_{H}}  [T_{H}] and the bottom isotherm is all at the same
cooler temperature      T  C     {\displaystyle T_{C}}  [T_{C}], and since
change in energy for an isochore is proportional to change in temperature, then
all of the heat coming in through the left isochore is cancelled out exactly by
the heat going out the right isochore.
***** State functions and entropy[edit] *****
If Z is a state_function then the balance of Z remains unchanged during a
cyclic process:
            &#x222E;      &#x2061; d Z = 0   {\displaystyle \oint dZ=0}  [\oint
      dZ=0].
Entropy is a state function and is defined as
         S =   Q T     {\displaystyle S={Q \over T}}  [S={Q \over T}]
so that
         &#x0394; S =    &#x0394; Q  T     {\displaystyle \Delta S={\Delta Q
      \over T}}  [\Delta S={\Delta Q \over T}],
then it appears that for any cyclic process,
            &#x222E;      &#x2061; d S =    &#x222E;      &#x2061;    d Q  T
      = 0   {\displaystyle \oint dS=\oint {dQ \over T}=0}  [\oint dS=\oint {dQ
      \over T}=0]
meaning that the net entropy change of the working fluid over a cycle is zero.
