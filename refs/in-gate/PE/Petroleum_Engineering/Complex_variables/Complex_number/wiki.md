Element of a number system in which â1 has a square root
A complex number can be visually represented as a pair of numbers (a,âb)
forming a vector on a diagram called an Argand_diagram, representing the
complex_plane. "Re" is the real axis, "Im" is the imaginary axis, and i
satisfies i2 = â1.
A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a
and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of the equation x2 = â1. Because
no real_number satisfies this equation, i is called an imaginary_number. For
the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part, and b is called the
imaginary part. Despite the historical nomenclature "imaginary", complex
numbers are regarded in the mathematical sciences as just as "real" as the real
numbers, and are fundamental in many aspects of the scientific description of
the natural world.[note_1][1]
Complex numbers allow solutions to certain equations that have no solutions in
real_numbers. For example, the equation
         ( x + 1  )  2   = &#x2212; 9   {\displaystyle (x+1)^{2}=-9}  [
      {\displaystyle (x+1)^{2}=-9}]
has no real solution, since the square of a real number cannot be negative.
Complex numbers provide a solution to this problem. The idea is to extend the
real numbers with an indeterminate i (sometimes called the imaginary_unit) that
is taken to satisfy the relation i2 = â1, so that solutions to equations like
the preceding one can be found. In this case the solutions are â1 + 3i and
â1 â 3i, as can be verified using the fact that i2 = â1:
         ( ( &#x2212; 1 + 3 i ) + 1  )  2   = ( 3 i  )  2   =  (  3  2   )
      (  i  2   )  = 9 ( &#x2212; 1 ) = &#x2212; 9 ,   {\displaystyle ((-
      1+3i)+1)^{2}=(3i)^{2}=\left(3^{2}\right)\left(i^{2}\right)=9(-1)=-9,}  [
      {\displaystyle ((-1+3i)+1)^{2}=(3i)^{2}=\left(3^{2}\right)\left(i^
      {2}\right)=9(-1)=-9,}]
         ( ( &#x2212; 1 &#x2212; 3 i ) + 1  )  2   = ( &#x2212; 3 i  )  2   =
      ( &#x2212; 3  )  2    (  i  2   )  = 9 ( &#x2212; 1 ) = &#x2212; 9.
      {\displaystyle ((-1-3i)+1)^{2}=(-3i)^{2}=(-3)^{2}\left(i^{2}\right)=9(-
      1)=-9.}  [{\displaystyle ((-1-3i)+1)^{2}=(-3i)^{2}=(-3)^{2}\left(i^
      {2}\right)=9(-1)=-9.}]
According to the fundamental_theorem_of_algebra, all polynomial_equations with
real or complex coefficients in a single variable have a solution in complex
numbers. In contrast, some polynomial equations with real coefficients have no
solution in real numbers. The 16th century Italian mathematician Gerolamo
Cardano is credited with introducing complex numbers in his attempts to find
solutions to cubic_equations.[2]
Formally, the complex number system can be defined as the algebraic_extension
of the ordinary real numbers by an imaginary number i.[3] This means that
complex numbers can be added, subtracted, and multiplied, as polynomials in the
variable i, with the rule i2 = â1 imposed. Furthermore, complex numbers can
also be divided by nonzero complex numbers. Overall, the complex number system
is a field.
Geometrically, complex numbers extend the concept of the one-dimensional number
line to the two-dimensional complex_plane by using the horizontal_axis for the
real part and the vertical_axis for the imaginary part. The complex number a +
bi can be identified with the point (a,âb) in the complex plane. A complex
number whose real part is zero is said to be purely imaginary; the points for
these numbers lie on the vertical axis of the complex plane. A complex number
whose imaginary part is zero can be viewed as a real number; its point lies on
the horizontal axis of the complex plane. Complex numbers can also be
represented in polar form, which associates each complex number with its
distance from the origin (its magnitude) and with a particular angle known as
the argument of this complex number.
The geometric identification of the complex numbers with the complex plane,
which is a Euclidean_plane (      R   2     {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}
[\mathbb {R} ^{2}]), makes their structure as a real 2-dimensional vector_space
evident. Real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be taken as
components of a vector with respect to the canonical standard_basis. The
addition of complex numbers is thus immediately depicted as the usual
component-wise addition of vectors. However, the complex numbers allow for a
richer algebraic structure, comprising additional operations, that are not
necessarily available in a vector space; e.g., the multiplication of two
complex numbers always yields again a complex number, and should not be
mistaken for the usual "products" involving vectors, like the scalar
multiplication, the scalar_product or other (sesqui)linear forms, available in
many vector spaces; and the broadly exploited vector_product exists only in an
orientation-dependent form in three dimensions.

***** Definition[edit] *****
An illustration of the complex_plane. The real part of a complex number z = x +
iy is x, and its imaginary part is y.
Based on the concept of real_numbers, a complex number is a number of the form
a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is an indeterminate satisfying i2
= â1. For example, 2 + 3i is a complex number.[4]
This way, a complex number is defined as a polynomial with real coefficients in
the single indeterminate i, for which the relation i2 + 1 = 0 is imposed. Based
on this definition, complex numbers can be added and multiplied, using the
addition and multiplication for polynomials. The relation i2 + 1 = 0 induces
the equalities i4k = 1 , i4k+1 = i , i4k+2 = â1 , and i4k+3 = âi , which
hold for all integers k; these allow the reduction of any polynomial that
results from the addition and multiplication of complex numbers to a linear
polynomial in i, again of the form a + bi with real coefficients a, b.
The real number a is called the real part of the complex number a + bi; the
real number b is called its imaginary part. To emphasize, the imaginary part
does not include a factor i and b, not bi, is the imaginary part.[5][6]
Formally, the complex numbers are defined as the quotient_ring of the
polynomial_ring in the indeterminate i, by the ideal generated by the
polynomial i2 + 1 (see below).[7]
***** Notation[edit] *****
A real number a can be regarded as a complex number a + 0i whose imaginary part
is 0. A purely imaginary_number bi is a complex number 0 + bi whose real part
is zero. As with polynomials, it is common to write a for a + 0i and bi for 0 +
bi. Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, i.e., b = â|b| < 0, it is
common to write a â |b|i instead of a + (â|b|)i; for example, for b = â4,
3 â 4i can be written instead of 3 + (â4)i.
Since in polynomials with real coefficients the multiplication of the
indeterminate i and a real is commutative, the polynomial a + bi may be written
as a + ib. This is often expedient for imaginary parts denoted by expressions,
e.g., when b is a radical.[8]
The real part of a complex number z is denoted by Re(z) or â(z); the
imaginary part of a complex number z is denoted by Im(z) or â(z). For
example,
         Re &#x2061; ( 2 + 3 i ) = 2    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re}
      (2+3i)=2\quad }  [{\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (2+3i)=2\quad }] and
      Im &#x2061; ( 2 + 3 i ) = 3.   {\displaystyle \quad \operatorname {Im}
      (2+3i)=3.}  [{\displaystyle \quad \operatorname {Im} (2+3i)=3.}]
The set of all complex numbers is denoted by      C    {\displaystyle \mathbf
{C} }  [\mathbf {C} ] (upright bold) or      C    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
[\mathbb {C} ] (blackboard_bold).
In some disciplines, in particular electromagnetism and electrical_engineering,
j is used instead of i since i is frequently used to represent electric
current.[9] In these cases complex numbers are written as a + bj or a + jb.
***** Visualisation[edit] *****
Main article: Complex_plane
A complex number z, as a point (red) and its position vector (blue)
A complex number z can thus be identified with an ordered_pair (Re(z), Im(z))
of real numbers, which in turn may be interpreted as coordinates of a point in
a two-dimensional space. The most immediate space is the Euclidean plane with
suitable coordinates, which is then called complex plane or Argand_diagram,[10]
[11] named after Jean-Robert_Argand. Another prominent space on which the
coordinates may be projected is the two-dimensional surface of a sphere, which
is then called Riemann_sphere.
**** Cartesian complex plane[edit] ****
The definition of the complex numbers involving two arbitrary real values
immediately suggest the use of Cartesian coordinates in the complex plane. The
horizontal (real) axis is generally used to display the real part with
increasing values to the right and the imaginary part marks the vertical
(imaginary) axis, increasing values upwards.
A charted number may be either viewed as the coordinatized point, or as a
position_vector from the origin to this point. The coordinate values of a
complex number z are said to give its Cartesian, rectangular, or algebraic
form.
Notably, the operations of addition and multiplication take on a very natural
geometric character when complex numbers are viewed as position vectors:
addition corresponds to vector_addition, while multiplication (see below)
corresponds to multiplying their magnitudes and adding the angles they make
with the real axis. Viewed in this way the multiplication of a complex number
by i corresponds to rotating the position vector counterclockwise by a quarter
turn (90Â°) about the origin
         ( a + b i ) &#x22C5; i = a i + b ( i  )  2   = &#x2212; b + a i .
      {\displaystyle (a+bi)\cdot i=ai+b(i)^{2}=-b+ai.}  [{\displaystyle
      (a+bi)\cdot i=ai+b(i)^{2}=-b+ai.}]
**** Polar complex plane [edit] ****
Main article: Polar_coordinate_system
"Polar form" redirects here. For the higher-dimensional analogue, see Polar
decomposition.
Argument Ï and modulus r locate a point in the complex plane.
*** Modulus and argument[edit] ***
An alternative option for coordinates in the complex plane is the polar
coordinate_system that uses the distance of the point z from the origin (O),
and the angle subtended between the positive_real_axis and the line segment Oz
in a counterclockwise sense. This leads to the polar form of complex numbers.
The absolute_value (or modulus or magnitude) of a complex number z = x + yi is
[12]
         r =  |  z  |  =    x  2   +  y  2     .   {\displaystyle r=|z|={\sqrt
      {x^{2}+y^{2}}}.}  [{\displaystyle r=|z|={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}.}]
If z is a real number (that is, if y = 0), then r = |x|. That is, the absolute
value of a real number equals its absolute value as a complex number.
By Pythagoras'_theorem, the absolute value of complex number is the distance to
the origin of the point representing the complex number in the complex_plane.
The argument of z (in many applications referred to as the "phase" Ï) is the
angle of the radius Oz with the positive real axis, and is written as     arg
&#x2061; ( z )   {\displaystyle \arg(z)}  [\arg(z)]. As with the modulus, the
argument can be found from the rectangular form     x + y i   {\displaystyle
x+yi}  [x+yi][13] by applying the inverse tangent to the quotient of imaginary-
by-real parts. By using a half-angle identity a single branch of the arctan
suffices to cover the range of the arg-function, (âÏ, Ï], and avoids a more
subtle case-by-case analysis
         &#x03C6; = arg &#x2061; ( x + y i ) =   {    2 arctan &#x2061;  (    y
      x  2   +  y  2     + x     )     if&#xA0;  x > 0  &#xA0;or&#xA0;  y
      &#x2260; 0 ,     &#x03C0;    if&#xA0;  x < 0  &#xA0;and&#xA0;  y = 0 ,
      undefined     if&#xA0;  x = 0  &#xA0;and&#xA0;  y = 0.
      {\displaystyle \varphi =\arg(x+yi)={\begin{cases}2\arctan \left({\dfrac
      {y}{{\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}+x}}\right)&{\text{if }}x>0{\text{ or }}y\neq
      0,\\\pi &{\text{if }}x<0{\text{ and }}y=0,\\{\text{undefined}}&{\text{if
      }}x=0{\text{ and }}y=0.\end{cases}}}  [{\displaystyle \varphi =\arg
      (x+yi)={\begin{cases}2\arctan \left({\dfrac {y}{{\sqrt {x^{2}+y^
      {2}}}+x}}\right)&{\text{if }}x>0{\text{ or }}y\neq 0,\\\pi &{\text{if
      }}x<0{\text{ and }}y=0,\\{\text{undefined}}&{\text{if }}x=0{\text{ and
      }}y=0.\end{cases}}}]
Normally, as given above, the principal_value in the interval (âÏ, Ï] is
chosen. Values in the range [0, 2Ï) are obtained by adding 2Ï if the value is
negative. The value of Ï is expressed in radians in this article. It can
increase by any integer multiple of 2Ï and still give the same angle, viewed
as subtended by the rays of the positive real axis and from the origin through
z. Hence, the arg function is sometimes considered as multivalued. The polar
angle for the complex number 0 is indeterminate, but arbitrary choice of the
angle 0 is common.
The value of Ï equals the result of atan2:
         &#x03C6; = atan2 &#x2061;  (  Im &#x2061; ( z ) , Re &#x2061; ( z )  )
      .   {\displaystyle \varphi =\operatorname {atan2} \left(\operatorname
      {Im} (z),\operatorname {Re} (z)\right).}  [{\displaystyle \varphi
      =\operatorname {atan2} \left(\operatorname {Im} (z),\operatorname {Re}
      (z)\right).}]
Together, r and Ï give another way of representing complex numbers, the polar
form, as the combination of modulus and argument fully specify the position of
a point on the plane. Recovering the original rectangular co-ordinates from the
polar form is done by the formula called trigonometric form
         z = r ( cos &#x2061; &#x03C6; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03C6; ) .
      {\displaystyle z=r(\cos \varphi +i\sin \varphi ).}  [{\displaystyle z=r
      (\cos \varphi +i\sin \varphi ).}]
Using Euler's_formula this can be written as
         z = r  e  i &#x03C6;   .   {\displaystyle z=re^{i\varphi }.}  [
      {\displaystyle z=re^{i\varphi }.}]
Using the cis function, this is sometimes abbreviated to
         z = r cis &#x2061; &#x03C6; .   {\displaystyle z=r\operatorname {cis}
      \varphi .}  [{\displaystyle z=r\operatorname {cis} \varphi .}]
In angle_notation, often used in electronics to represent a phasor with
amplitude r and phase Ï, it is written as[14]
         z = r &#x2220; &#x03C6; .   {\displaystyle z=r\angle \varphi .}  [
      {\displaystyle z=r\angle \varphi .}]
**** Complex graphs[edit] ****
A color wheel graph of the expression (z2 â 1)(z â 2 â i)2/z2 + 2 + 2i
Main articles: Domain_coloring and Riemann_surface
When visualizing complex_functions, both a complex input and output are needed.
Because each complex number is represented in two dimensions, visually graphing
a complex function would require the perception of a four_dimensional_space,
which is possible only in projections. Because of this, other ways of
visualizing complex functions have been designed.
In Domain_coloring the output dimensions are represented by color and
brightness, respectively. Each point in the complex plane as domain is ornated,
typically with color representing the argument of the complex number, and
brightness representing the magnitude. Dark spots mark moduli near zero,
brighter spots are farther away from the origin, the gradation may be
discontinuous, but is assumed as monotonous. The colors often vary in steps of
Ï/3 for 0 to 2Ï from red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, to magenta. These plots
are called color_wheel_graphs. This provides a simple way to visualize the
functions without losing information. The picture shows zeros for Â±1, (2+i)
and poles at Â±√â2â2i.
Riemann_surfaces are another way to visualize complex functions.[further
explanation_needed] Riemann surfaces can be thought of as deformations of the
complex plane; while the horizontal axes represent the real and imaginary
inputs, the single vertical axis only represents either the real or imaginary
output. However, Riemann surfaces are built in such a way that rotating them
180 degrees shows the imaginary output, and vice versa. Unlike domain coloring,
Riemann surfaces can represent multivalued_functions like       z
{\displaystyle {\sqrt {z}}}  [\sqrt{z}].
***** History[edit] *****
The solution in radicals (without trigonometric_functions) of a general cubic
equation contains the square roots of negative_numbers when all three roots are
real numbers, a situation that cannot be rectified by factoring aided by the
rational_root_test if the cubic is irreducible (the so-called casus
irreducibilis). This conundrum led Italian mathematician Gerolamo_Cardano to
conceive of complex numbers in around 1545,[15] though his understanding was
rudimentary.
Work on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the fundamental
theorem_of_algebra, which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to
every polynomial equation of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus form an
algebraically_closed_field, where any polynomial equation has a root.
Many mathematicians contributed to the full development of complex numbers. The
rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and root extraction of complex
numbers were developed by the Italian mathematician Rafael_Bombelli.[16] A more
abstract formalism for the complex numbers was further developed by the Irish
mathematician William_Rowan_Hamilton, who extended this abstraction to the
theory of quaternions.
The earliest fleeting reference to square_roots of negative_numbers can perhaps
be said to occur in the work of the Greek_mathematician Hero_of_Alexandria in
the 1st century AD, where in his Stereometrica he considers, apparently in
error, the volume of an impossible frustum of a pyramid to arrive at the term
81 &#x2212; 144   = 3 i   7     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {81-144}}=3i{\sqrt {7}}}
[{\sqrt  {81-144}}=3i{\sqrt  {7}}] in his calculations, although negative
quantities were not conceived of in Hellenistic_mathematics and Hero merely
replaced it by its positive (      144 &#x2212; 81   = 3   7     {\displaystyle
{\sqrt {144-81}}=3{\sqrt {7}}}  [{\sqrt  {144-81}}=3{\sqrt  {7}}]).[17]
The impetus to study complex numbers as a topic in itself first arose in the
16th century when algebraic_solutions for the roots of cubic and quartic
polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians (see NiccolÃ²_Fontana
Tartaglia, Gerolamo_Cardano). It was soon realized that these formulas, even if
one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation
of square roots of negative numbers. As an example, Tartaglia's formula for a
cubic equation of the form      x  3   = p x + q   {\displaystyle x^{3}=px+q}
[x^3 = px + q][note_2] gives the solution to the equation x3 = x as
            1  3      (    (   &#x2212; 1   )   1  /  3   +   (   &#x2212; 1
      )   &#x2212; 1  /  3    )  .   {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\sqrt
      {3}}}\left(\left({\sqrt {-1}}\right)^{1/3}+\left({\sqrt {-1}}\right)^{-1/
      3}\right).}  [{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\sqrt {3}}}\left(\left({\sqrt {-
      1}}\right)^{1/3}+\left({\sqrt {-1}}\right)^{-1/3}\right).}]
At first glance this looks like nonsense. However formal calculations with
complex numbers show that the equation z3 = i has solutions âi,         3  2
+    1 2    i   {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}i}  [
{\displaystyle {\tfrac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}i}] and         &#x2212;
3    2    +    1 2    i   {\displaystyle {\tfrac {-{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}+{\tfrac {1}
{2}}i}  [{\displaystyle {\tfrac {-{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}+{\tfrac {1}{2}}i}].
Substituting these in turn for         &#x2212; 1    1  /  3
{\displaystyle {{\sqrt {-1}}^{1/3}}}  [{\displaystyle {{\sqrt {-1}}^{1/3}}}] in
Tartaglia's cubic formula and simplifying, one gets 0, 1 and â1 as the
solutions of x3 â x = 0. Of course this particular equation can be solved at
sight but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve cubic
equations with real roots then, as later mathematicians showed rigorously, the
use of complex numbers is_unavoidable. Rafael_Bombelli was the first to
explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic equations and
developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to resolve these issues.
The term "imaginary" for these quantities was coined by RenÃ©_Descartes in
1637, although he was at pains to stress their imaginary nature[18]
     [...] sometimes only imaginary, that is one can imagine as many as I
     said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity that
     matches that which we imagine.
     ([...] quelquefois seulement imaginaires c'est-Ã -dire que l'on peut
     toujours en imaginer autant que j'ai dit en chaque Ã©quation, mais
     qu'il n'y a quelquefois aucune quantitÃ© qui corresponde Ã  celle
     qu'on imagine.)
A further source of confusion was that the equation        &#x2212; 1    2   =
&#x2212; 1     &#x2212; 1   = &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-1}}^{2}=
{\sqrt {-1}}{\sqrt {-1}}=-1}  [\sqrt{-1}^2=\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}=-1] seemed to be
capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity       a     b   =   a b
{\displaystyle {\sqrt {a}}{\sqrt {b}}={\sqrt {ab}}}  [\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}=\sqrt
{ab}], which is valid for non-negative real numbers a and b, and which was also
used in complex number calculations with one of a, b positive and the other
negative. The incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity        1
a     =     1 a       {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\sqrt {a}}}={\sqrt {\tfrac {1}
{a}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{\sqrt {a}}}={\sqrt {\tfrac {1}{a}}}}]) in
the case when both a and b are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty
eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol i in place of
√â1 to guard against this mistake.[citation_needed] Even so, Euler considered
it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do
today. In his elementary algebra text book, Elements_of_Algebra, he introduces
these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout.
In the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed that
formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to simplify
calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance, in 1730 Abraham
de_Moivre noted that the complicated identities relating trigonometric
functions of an integer multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric
functions of that angle could be simply re-expressed by the following well-
known formula which bears his name, de_Moivre's_formula:
         ( cos &#x2061; &#x03B8; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03B8;  )  n   = cos
      &#x2061; n &#x03B8; + i sin &#x2061; n &#x03B8; .   {\displaystyle (\cos
      \theta +i\sin \theta )^{n}=\cos n\theta +i\sin n\theta .}  [
      {\displaystyle (\cos \theta +i\sin \theta )^{n}=\cos n\theta +i\sin
      n\theta .}]
In 1748 Leonhard_Euler went further and obtained Euler's_formula of complex
analysis:
         cos &#x2061; &#x03B8; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; =  e  i &#x03B8;
      {\displaystyle \cos \theta +i\sin \theta =e^{i\theta }}  [{\displaystyle
      \cos \theta +i\sin \theta =e^{i\theta }}]
by formally manipulating complex power_series and observed that this formula
could be used to reduce any trigonometric identity to much simpler exponential
identities.
The idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane (above) was first
described by Caspar_Wessel in 1799, although it had been anticipated as early
as 1685 in Wallis's De Algebra tractatus.
Wessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the Copenhagen_Academy but went
largely unnoticed. In 1806 Jean-Robert_Argand independently issued a pamphlet
on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the fundamental_theorem_of
algebra. Carl_Friedrich_Gauss had earlier published an essentially topological
proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his doubts at the time about "the
true metaphysics of the square root of â1". It was not until 1831 that he
overcame these doubts and published his treatise on complex numbers as points
in the plane, largely establishing modern notation and terminology. In the
beginning of the 19th century, other mathematicians discovered independently
the geometrical representation of the complex numbers: BuÃ©e, Mourey, Warren,
FranÃ§ais and his brother, Bellavitis.[19]
The English mathematician G.H._Hardy remarked that Gauss was the first
mathematician to use complex numbers in 'a really confident and scientific way'
although mathematicians such as Niels_Henrik_Abel and Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi
were necessarily using them routinely before Gauss published his 1831 treatise.
[20]
     âIf this subject has hitherto been considered from the wrong
     viewpoint and thus enveloped in mystery and surrounded by darkness,
     it is largely an unsuitable terminology which should be blamed. Had
     +1, -1 and ââ1, instead of being called positive, negative and
     imaginary (or worse still, impossible) unity, been given the names
     say,of direct, inverse and lateral unity, there would hardly have
     been any scope for such obscurity.â - Gauss[21]
Augustin_Louis_Cauchy and Bernhard_Riemann together brought the fundamental
ideas of complex_analysis to a high state of completion, commencing around 1825
in Cauchy's case.
The common terms used in the theory are chiefly due to the founders. Argand
called     cos &#x2061; &#x03D5; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03D5;   {\displaystyle
\cos \phi +i\sin \phi }  [\cos \phi +i\sin \phi ] the direction factor, and
r =    a  2   +  b  2       {\displaystyle r={\sqrt {a^{2}+b^{2}}}}  [r = \sqrt
{a^2+b^2}] the modulus; Cauchy (1828) called     cos &#x2061; &#x03D5; + i sin
&#x2061; &#x03D5;   {\displaystyle \cos \phi +i\sin \phi }  [\cos \phi +i\sin
\phi ] the reduced form (l'expression rÃ©duite) and apparently introduced the
term argument; Gauss used i for       &#x2212; 1     {\displaystyle {\sqrt {-
1}}}  [{\sqrt {-1}}], introduced the term complex number for a + bi, and called
a2 + b2 the norm. The expression direction coefficient, often used for     cos
&#x2061; &#x03D5; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03D5;   {\displaystyle \cos \phi +i\sin
\phi }  [\cos \phi +i\sin \phi ], is due to Hankel (1867), and absolute value,
for modulus, is due to Weierstrass.
Later classical writers on the general theory include Richard_Dedekind, Otto
HÃ¶lder, Felix_Klein, Henri_PoincarÃ©, Hermann_Schwarz, Karl_Weierstrass and
many others.
***** Relations and operations[edit] *****
**** Equality[edit] ****
Two complex numbers are equal if_and_only_if both their real and imaginary
parts are equal. That is, complex numbers      z  1     {\displaystyle z_{1}}
[z_{1}] and      z  2     {\displaystyle z_{2}}  [z_{2}] are equal if and only
if     Re &#x2061; (  z  1   ) = Re &#x2061; (  z  2   )   {\displaystyle
\operatorname {Re} (z_{1})=\operatorname {Re} (z_{2})}  [{\displaystyle
\operatorname {Re} (z_{1})=\operatorname {Re} (z_{2})}] and     Im &#x2061;
(  z  1   ) = Im &#x2061; (  z  2   )   {\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} (z_
{1})=\operatorname {Im} (z_{2})}  [{\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} (z_
{1})=\operatorname {Im} (z_{2})}]. If the complex numbers are written in polar
form, they are equal if and only if they have the same argument and the same
magnitude.
**** Ordering[edit] ****
Since complex numbers are naturally thought of as existing on a two-dimensional
plane, there is no natural linear_ordering on the set of complex numbers. In
fact, there is no linear_ordering on the complex numbers that is compatible
with addition and multiplication â the complex numbers cannot have the
structure of an ordered_field. This is because any square in an ordered field
is at least 0, but i2 = â1.
**** Conjugate[edit] ****
See also: Complex_conjugate
Geometric representation of z and its conjugate       z &#x00AF;
{\displaystyle {\overline {z}}}  [{\overline {z}}] in the complex plane
The complex_conjugate of the complex number z = x + yi is given by x â yi. It
is denoted by either       z &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle {\overline {z}}}  [
{\overline {z}}] or z*.[22] This unary_operation on complex numbers cannot be
expressed by applying only their basic operations addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division.
Geometrically,       z &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle {\overline {z}}}  [
{\overline {z}}] is the "reflection" of z about the real axis. Conjugating
twice gives the original complex number
            z &#x00AF;  &#x00AF;   = z ,   {\displaystyle {\overline {\overline
      {z}}}=z,}  [{\displaystyle {\overline {\overline {z}}}=z,}]
which makes this operation an involution. The reflection leaves both the real
part and the magnitude of     z   {\displaystyle z}  [z] unchanged, that is
         Re &#x2061; (   z &#x00AF;   ) = Re &#x2061; ( z )    {\displaystyle
      \operatorname {Re} ({\overline {z}})=\operatorname {Re} (z)\quad }  [
      {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} ({\overline {z}})=\operatorname {Re}
      (z)\quad }] and       |    z &#x00AF;    |  =  |  z  |  .
      {\displaystyle \quad |{\overline {z}}|=|z|.}  [{\displaystyle \quad |
      {\overline {z}}|=|z|.}]
The imaginary part and the argument of a complex number     z   {\displaystyle
z}  [z] change their sign under conjugation
         Im &#x2061; (   z &#x00AF;   ) = &#x2212; Im &#x2061; ( z )
      {\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} ({\overline {z}})=-\operatorname {Im}
      (z)\quad }  [{\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} ({\overline {z}})=-
      \operatorname {Im} (z)\quad }] and      arg &#x2061; (   z &#x00AF;   )
      &#x2261; &#x2212; arg &#x2061; ( z )   ( mod  2 &#x03C0; )  .
      {\displaystyle \quad \operatorname {arg} ({\overline {z}})\equiv -
      \operatorname {arg} (z){\pmod {2\pi }}.}  [{\displaystyle \quad
      \operatorname {arg} ({\overline {z}})\equiv -\operatorname {arg} (z)
      {\pmod {2\pi }}.}]
For details on argument and magnitude, see the section on Polar_form.
The product of a complex number     z = x + y i   {\displaystyle z=x+yi}  [
{\displaystyle z=x+yi}] and its conjugate is always a positive real number and
equals the square of the magnitude of each:
         z &#x22C5;   z &#x00AF;   =  x  2   +  y  2   =  |  z   |   2   =  |
      z &#x00AF;     |   2   .   {\displaystyle z\cdot {\overline {z}}=x^{2}+y^
      {2}=|z|^{2}=|{\overline {z}}|^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle z\cdot {\overline
      {z}}=x^{2}+y^{2}=|z|^{2}=|{\overline {z}}|^{2}.}]
This property can be used used to convert a fraction with a complex denominator
to an equivalent fraction with a real denominator by expanding both numerator
and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the given denominator. This
process is sometimes called "rationalization" of the denominator (although the
denominator in the final expression might be an irrational real number),
because it resembles the method to remove roots from simple expressions in a
denominator.
The real and imaginary parts of a complex number z can be extracted using the
conjugation:
         Re &#x2061; ( z ) =     z +   z &#x00AF;    2    ,    {\displaystyle
      \operatorname {Re} (z)={\dfrac {z+{\overline {z}}}{2}},\quad }  [
      {\displaystyle \operatorname {Re} (z)={\dfrac {z+{\overline {z}}}
      {2}},\quad }] and      Im &#x2061; ( z ) =     z &#x2212;   z &#x00AF;
      2 i     .   {\displaystyle \quad \operatorname {Im} (z)={\dfrac {z-
      {\overline {z}}}{2i}}.}  [{\displaystyle \quad \operatorname {Im} (z)=
      {\dfrac {z-{\overline {z}}}{2i}}.}]
Moreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its own conjugate.
Conjugation distributes over the basic complex arithmetic operations:
            z &#x00B1; w  &#x00AF;   =   z &#x00AF;   &#x00B1;   w &#x00AF;   ,
      {\displaystyle {\overline {z\pm w}}={\overline {z}}\pm {\overline {w}},}
      [{\displaystyle {\overline {z\pm w}}={\overline {z}}\pm {\overline
      {w}},}]
            z &#x22C5; w  &#x00AF;   =   z &#x00AF;   &#x22C5;   w &#x00AF;   ,
      z  /  w  &#x00AF;   =   z &#x00AF;    /    w &#x00AF;   .
      {\displaystyle {\overline {z\cdot w}}={\overline {z}}\cdot {\overline
      {w}},\quad {\overline {z/w}}={\overline {z}}/{\overline {w}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle {\overline {z\cdot w}}={\overline {z}}\cdot {\overline
      {w}},\quad {\overline {z/w}}={\overline {z}}/{\overline {w}}.}]
Conjugation is also employed in inversive_geometry, a branch of geometry
studying reflections more general than ones about a line. In the network
analysis_of_electrical_circuits, the complex conjugate is used in finding the
equivalent impedance when the maximum_power_transfer_theorem is looked for.
**** Addition and subtraction[edit] ****
Addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a
parallelogram.
Two complex numbers     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] and     b   {\displaystyle
b}  [b] are most easily added by separately adding their real and imaginary
parts of the summands. That is to say:
         a + b = ( x + y i ) + ( u + v i ) = ( x + u ) + ( y + v ) i .
      {\displaystyle a+b=(x+yi)+(u+vi)=(x+u)+(y+v)i.}  [{\displaystyle a+b=
      (x+yi)+(u+vi)=(x+u)+(y+v)i.}]
Similarly, subtraction can be performed as
         a &#x2212; b = ( x + y i ) &#x2212; ( u + v i ) = ( x &#x2212; u ) +
      ( y &#x2212; v ) i .   {\displaystyle a-b=(x+yi)-(u+vi)=(x-u)+(y-v)i.}  [
      {\displaystyle a-b=(x+yi)-(u+vi)=(x-u)+(y-v)i.}]
Using the visualization of complex numbers in the complex plane, the addition
has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers
a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] and     b   {\displaystyle b}  [b], interpreted as
points in the complex plane, is the point obtained by building a parallelogram
from the three vertices     O   {\displaystyle O}  [O], and the points of the
arrows labeled     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] and     b   {\displaystyle b}
[b] (provided that they are not on a line). Equivalently, calling these points
A ,  B ,   {\displaystyle A,\;B,}  [{\displaystyle A,\;B,}] respectively and
the fourth point of the parallelogram     X ,   {\displaystyle X,}  [X,] the
triangles     O A B   {\displaystyle OAB}  [OAB] and     X B A   {\displaystyle
XBA}  [{\displaystyle XBA}] are congruent. A visualization of the subtraction
can be achieved by considering addition of the negative subtrahend.
**** Multiplication[edit] ****
Since the real part, the imaginary part, and the indeterminate     i
{\displaystyle i}  [i] in a complex number are all considered as numbers in
themselves, two complex numbers, given as     z = x + y i   {\displaystyle
z=x+yi}  [{\displaystyle z=x+yi}] and     w = u + v i   {\displaystyle w=u+vi}
[{\displaystyle w=u+vi}] are multiplied under the rules of the distributive
property, the commutative_properties and the defining property      i  2   =
&#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle i^{2}=-1}  [i^{2}=-1] in the following way
             z &#x22C5; w    = ( x + y i ) &#x22C5; ( u + v i )        = x ( u
      + v i ) + y i ( u + v i )     by the (right) distributive law        = x
      u + x v i + y i u + y i v i     by the (left) distributive law        = x
      u + y i v i + x v i + y i u     by the commutativity of addition        =
      x u + y v  i  2   + x v i + y u i     by the commutativity of
      multiplication        = ( x u + y v  i  2   ) + ( x v i + y u i )     by
      the associativity of addition        = ( x u &#x2212; y v ) + ( x v i + y
      u i )     by the defining property of&#xA0;  i       = ( x u &#x2212; y v
      ) + ( x v + y u ) i     by the distributive law  .       {\displaystyle
      {\begin{aligned}z\cdot w&=(x+yi)\cdot (u+vi)&\\&=x(u+vi)+yi(u+vi)&&{\text
      {by the (right) distributive law}}\\&=xu+xvi+yiu+yivi&&{\text{by the
      (left) distributive law}}\\&=xu+yivi+xvi+yiu&&{\text{by the commutativity

      [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z\cdot w&=(x+yi)\cdot (u+vi)&\\&=x

      }}i\\&=(xu-yv)+(xv+yu)i&&{\text{by the distributive law}}.\end
      {aligned}}}]
**** Reciprocal and division[edit] ****
Using the conjugation, the reciprocal of a nonzero complex number z = x + yi
can always be broken down to
           1 z   =    z &#x00AF;   z   z &#x00AF;      =    z &#x00AF;    |  z
      |   2      =    z &#x00AF;    x  2   +  y  2      =   x   x  2   +  y  2
      &#x2212;   y   x  2   +  y  2      i ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{z}}=
      {\frac {\overline {z}}{z{\overline {z}}}}={\frac {\overline {z}}{|z|^
      {2}}}={\frac {\overline {z}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}={\frac {x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}-
      {\frac {y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}i,}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{z}}={\frac
      {\overline {z}}{z{\overline {z}}}}={\frac {\overline {z}}{|z|^{2}}}=
      {\frac {\overline {z}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}={\frac {x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}-{\frac {y}
      {x^{2}+y^{2}}}i,}]
since non-zero implies that      x  2   +  y  2     {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}}
[x^{2}+y^{2}] is greater than zero.
This can be used to express a division of an arbitrary complex number     w = u
+ v i   {\displaystyle w=u+vi}  [{\displaystyle w=u+vi}] by a non-zero complex
number     z   {\displaystyle z}  [z] as
           w z   = w &#x22C5;   1 z   = ( u + v i ) &#x22C5;  (    x   x  2   +
      y  2      &#x2212;   y   x  2   +  y  2      i  )  =   1   x  2   +  y  2
      (  ( u x + v y ) + ( v x &#x2212; u y ) i  )  .   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {w}{z}}=w\cdot {\frac {1}{z}}=(u+vi)\cdot \left({\frac {x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}-
      {\frac {y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}i\right)={\frac {1}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}\left((ux+vy)+
      (vx-uy)i\right).}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {w}{z}}=w\cdot {\frac {1}{z}}=
      (u+vi)\cdot \left({\frac {x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}-{\frac {y}{x^{2}+y^
      {2}}}i\right)={\frac {1}{x^{2}+y^{2}}}\left((ux+vy)+(vx-uy)i\right).}]
**** Multiplication and division in polar form[edit] ****
Multiplication of 2 + i (blue triangle) and 3 + i (red triangle). The red
triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by √5,
the length of the hypotenuse of the blue triangle.
Formulas for multiplication, division and exponentiation are simpler in polar
form than the corresponding formulas in Cartesian coordinates. Given two
complex numbers z1 = r1(cosâÏ1 + iâsinâÏ1) and z2 = r2(cosâÏ2 +
iâsinâÏ2), because of the trigonometric identities
         cos &#x2061; ( a ) cos &#x2061; ( b ) &#x2212; sin &#x2061; ( a ) sin
      &#x2061; ( b ) = cos &#x2061; ( a + b )   {\displaystyle \cos(a)\cos(b)-
      \sin(a)\sin(b)=\cos(a+b)}  [\cos(a)\cos(b)-\sin(a)\sin(b)=\cos(a+b)]
         cos &#x2061; ( a ) sin &#x2061; ( b ) + sin &#x2061; ( a ) cos
      &#x2061; ( b ) = sin &#x2061; ( a + b )   {\displaystyle \cos(a)\sin
      (b)+\sin(a)\cos(b)=\sin(a+b)}  [\cos(a)\sin(b)+\sin(a)\cos(b)=\sin(a+b)]
we may derive
          z  1    z  2   =  r  1    r  2   ( cos &#x2061; (  &#x03C6;  1   +
      &#x03C6;  2   ) + i sin &#x2061; (  &#x03C6;  1   +  &#x03C6;  2   ) ) .
      {\displaystyle z_{1}z_{2}=r_{1}r_{2}(\cos(\varphi _{1}+\varphi _
      {2})+i\sin(\varphi _{1}+\varphi _{2})).}  [{\displaystyle z_{1}z_{2}=r_
      {1}r_{2}(\cos(\varphi _{1}+\varphi _{2})+i\sin(\varphi _{1}+\varphi _
      {2})).}]
In other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are added
to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying by i
corresponds to a quarter-turn counter-clockwise, which gives back i2 = â1.
The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of
         ( 2 + i ) ( 3 + i ) = 5 + 5 i .   {\displaystyle (2+i)(3+i)=5+5i.}  [
      {\displaystyle (2+i)(3+i)=5+5i.}]
Since the real and imaginary part of 5 + 5i are equal, the argument of that
number is 45 degrees, or Ï/4 (in radian). On the other hand, it is also the
sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangles are arctan(1/3)
and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula
           &#x03C0; 4   = arctan &#x2061;  (   1 2   )  + arctan &#x2061;
      (   1 3   )    {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{4}}=\arctan \left({\frac {1}
      {2}}\right)+\arctan \left({\frac {1}{3}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {\pi }{4}}=\arctan \left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)+\arctan \left({\frac {1}
      {3}}\right)}]
holds. As the arctan function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas
like this â known as Machin-like_formulas â are used for high-precision
approximations of Ï.
Similarly, division is given by
            z  1    z  2     =    r  1    r  2      (  cos &#x2061; (  &#x03C6;
      1   &#x2212;  &#x03C6;  2   ) + i sin &#x2061; (  &#x03C6;  1   &#x2212;
      &#x03C6;  2   )  )  .   {\displaystyle {\frac {z_{1}}{z_{2}}}={\frac {r_
      {1}}{r_{2}}}\left(\cos(\varphi _{1}-\varphi _{2})+i\sin(\varphi _{1}-
      \varphi _{2})\right).}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {z_{1}}{z_{2}}}={\frac {r_
      {1}}{r_{2}}}\left(\cos(\varphi _{1}-\varphi _{2})+i\sin(\varphi _{1}-
      \varphi _{2})\right).}]

Euler's_formula states that, for any real number x,

      e^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x\ }  [e^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x\ ],
where e is the base_of_the_natural_logarithm. This can be proved through

The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely

*** Natural logarithm[edit] ***
It follows from Euler's formula that, for any complex number z written in polar
form,
         z = r ( cos &#x2061; &#x03C6; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03C6; )
      {\displaystyle z=r(\cos \varphi +i\sin \varphi )}  [{\displaystyle z=r
      (\cos \varphi +i\sin \varphi )}]
where r is a non-negative real number, one possible value for the complex
logarithm of z is
         ln &#x2061; ( z ) = ln &#x2061; ( r ) + &#x03C6; i .   {\displaystyle
      \ln(z)=\ln(r)+\varphi i.}  [{\displaystyle \ln(z)=\ln(r)+\varphi i.}]
Because cosine and sine are periodic functions, other possible values may be
obtained. For example,      e  i &#x03C0;   =  e  3 i &#x03C0;   = &#x2212; 1
{\displaystyle e^{i\pi }=e^{3i\pi }=-1}  [{\displaystyle e^{i\pi }=e^{3i\pi }=-
1}], so both     i &#x03C0;   {\displaystyle i\pi }  [{\displaystyle i\pi }]
and     3 i &#x03C0;   {\displaystyle 3i\pi }  [{\displaystyle 3i\pi }] are two
possible values for the natural logarithm of     &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle -
1}  [-1].
To deal with the existence of more than one possible value for a given input,
the complex logarithm may be considered a multi-valued function, with
         ln &#x2061; ( z ) =  {  ln &#x2061; ( r ) + ( &#x03C6; + 2 &#x03C0; k
      ) i &#x2223; k &#x2208;  Z   }  .   {\displaystyle \ln(z)=\left\{\ln(r)+
      (\varphi +2\pi k)i\mid k\in \mathbb {Z} \right\}.}  [{\displaystyle \ln
      (z)=\left\{\ln(r)+(\varphi +2\pi k)i\mid k\in \mathbb {Z} \right\}.}]
Alternatively, a branch_cut can be used to define a single-valued "branch" of
the complex logarithm.

We may use the identity
         ln &#x2061; (  a  b   ) = b ln &#x2061; a   {\displaystyle \ln(a^
      {b})=b\ln a}  [{\displaystyle \ln(a^{b})=b\ln a}]
to define complex exponentiation, which is likewise multi-valued:
             ln &#x2061; (  z  n   )    = ln &#x2061; ( ( r ( cos &#x2061;
      &#x03C6; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03C6; )  )  n   )       = n ln &#x2061; ( r
      ( cos &#x2061; &#x03C6; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03C6; ) )       = { n ( ln
      &#x2061; ( r ) + ( &#x03C6; + k 2 &#x03C0; ) i ) &#x2223; k &#x2208;  Z
      }       = { n ln &#x2061; ( r ) + n &#x03C6; i + n k 2 &#x03C0; i
      &#x2223; k &#x2208;  Z  } .       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\ln(z^
      {n})&=\ln((r(\cos \varphi +i\sin \varphi ))^{n})\\[5pt]&=n\ln(r(\cos
      \varphi +i\sin \varphi ))\\[5pt]&=\{n(\ln(r)+(\varphi +k2\pi )i)\mid k\in
      \mathbb {Z} \}\\[5pt]&=\{n\ln(r)+n\varphi i+nk2\pi i\mid k\in \mathbb {Z}
      \}.\end{aligned}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\ln(z^{n})&=\ln((r
      (\cos \varphi +i\sin \varphi ))^{n})\\[5pt]&=n\ln(r(\cos \varphi +i\sin
      \varphi ))\\[5pt]&=\{n(\ln(r)+(\varphi +k2\pi )i)\mid k\in \mathbb {Z}
      \}\\[5pt]&=\{n\ln(r)+n\varphi i+nk2\pi i\mid k\in \mathbb {Z} \}.\end
      {aligned}}}]
When n is an integer, this simplifies to de_Moivre's_formula:
          z  n   = ( r ( cos &#x2061; &#x03C6; + i sin &#x2061; &#x03C6; )  )
      n   =  r  n   &#x22C5; ( cos &#x2061; n &#x03C6; + i sin &#x2061; n
      &#x03C6; ) .   {\displaystyle z^{n}=(r(\cos \varphi +i\sin \varphi ))^
      {n}=r^{n}\cdot (\cos n\varphi +i\sin n\varphi ).}  [{\displaystyle z^{n}=
      (r(\cos \varphi +i\sin \varphi ))^{n}=r^{n}\cdot (\cos n\varphi +i\sin
      n\varphi ).}]
The nth roots of z are given by
           z  n    =   r  n     (  cos &#x2061;  (    &#x03C6; + 2 k &#x03C0;
      n   )  + i sin &#x2061;  (    &#x03C6; + 2 k &#x03C0;  n   )   )
      {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{n}]{z}}={\sqrt[{n}]{r}}\left(\cos \left({\frac
      {\varphi +2k\pi }{n}}\right)+i\sin \left({\frac {\varphi +2k\pi }
      {n}}\right)\right)}  [{\sqrt[{n}]{z}}={\sqrt[{n}]{r}}\left(\cos \left(
      {\frac {\varphi +2k\pi }{n}}\right)+i\sin \left({\frac {\varphi +2k\pi }
      {n}}\right)\right)]
for any integer k satisfying 0 â¤ k â¤ n â 1. Here n√r is the usual
(positive) nth root of the positive real number r. While the nth root of a
positive real number r is chosen to be the positive real number c satisfying cn
= r, there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex nth root
of a complex number. Therefore, the nth root of z is considered as a
multivalued_function (in z), as opposed to a usual function f, for which f(z)
is a uniquely defined number. Formulas such as
            z  n    n    = z   {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{n}]{z^{n}}}=z}  [{\sqrt[
      {n}]{z^{n}}}=z]
(which holds for positive real numbers), do in general not hold for complex
numbers.
***** Properties[edit] *****
**** Field structure[edit] ****
The set C of complex numbers is a field.[26] Briefly, this means that the
following facts hold: first, any two complex numbers can be added and
multiplied to yield another complex number. Second, for any complex number z,
its additive_inverse âz is also a complex number; and third, every nonzero
complex number has a reciprocal complex number. Moreover, these operations
satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of commutativity of addition and
multiplication for any two complex numbers z1 and z2:
          z  1   +  z  2   =  z  2   +  z  1   ,   {\displaystyle z_{1}+z_
      {2}=z_{2}+z_{1},}  [z_{1}+z_{2}=z_{2}+z_{1},]
          z  1    z  2   =  z  2    z  1   .   {\displaystyle z_{1}z_{2}=z_
      {2}z_{1}.}  [z_{1}z_{2}=z_{2}z_{1}.]
These two laws and the other requirements on a field can be proven by the
formulas given above, using the fact that the real numbers themselves form a
field.
Unlike the reals, C is not an ordered_field, that is to say, it is not possible
to define a relation z1 < z2 that is compatible with the addition and
multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the square of any element is
necessarily positive, so i2 = â1 precludes the existence of an ordering on C.
[27]
When the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the field of
complex numbers, the topic's name is usually modified to reflect that fact. For
example: complex_analysis, complex matrix, complex polynomial, and complex Lie
algebra.
**** Solutions of polynomial equations[edit] ****
Given any complex numbers (called coefficients) a0,â...,âan, the equation
          a  n    z  n   + &#x22EF; +  a  1   z +  a  0   = 0   {\displaystyle
      a_{n}z^{n}+\dotsb +a_{1}z+a_{0}=0}  [a_{n}z^{n}+\dotsb +a_{1}z+a_{0}=0]
has at least one complex solution z, provided that at least one of the higher
coefficients a1,â...,âan is nonzero.[28] This is the statement of the
fundamental_theorem_of_algebra, of Carl_Friedrich_Gauss and Jean_le_Rond
d'Alembert. Because of this fact, C is called an algebraically_closed_field.
This property does not hold for the field_of_rational_numbers Q (the polynomial
x2 â 2 does not have a rational root, since √2 is not a rational number) nor
the real numbers R (the polynomial x2 + a does not have a real root for a > 0,
since the square of x is positive for any real number x).
There are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods such as
Liouville's_theorem, or topological ones such as the winding_number, or a proof
combining Galois_theory and the fact that any real polynomial of odd degree has
at least one real root.
Because of this fact, theorems that hold for any algebraically closed field,
apply to C. For example, any non-empty complex square_matrix has at least one
(complex) eigenvalue.
**** Algebraic characterization[edit] ****
The field C has the following three properties: first, it has characteristic 0.
This means that 1 + 1 + â¯ + 1 â  0 for any number of summands (all of which
equal one). Second, its transcendence_degree over Q, the prime_field of C, is
the cardinality_of_the_continuum. Third, it is algebraically_closed (see
above). It can be shown that any field having these properties is isomorphic
(as a field) to C. For example, the algebraic_closure of Qp also satisfies
these three properties, so these two fields are isomorphic (as fields, but not
as topological fields).[29] Also, C is isomorphic to the field of complex
Puiseux_series. However, specifying an isomorphism requires the axiom_of
choice. Another consequence of this algebraic characterization is that C
contains many proper subfields that are isomorphic to C.
**** Characterization as a topological field[edit] ****
The preceding characterization of C describes only the algebraic aspects of C.
That is to say, the properties of nearness and continuity, which matter in
areas such as analysis and topology, are not dealt with. The following
description of C as a topological_field (that is, a field that is equipped with
a topology, which allows the notion of convergence) does take into account the
topological properties. C contains a subset P (namely the set of positive real
numbers) of nonzero elements satisfying the following three conditions:
    * P is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.
    * If x and y are distinct elements of P, then either x â y or y â x is
      in P.
    * If S is any nonempty subset of P, then S + P = x + P for some x in C.
Moreover, C has a nontrivial involutive automorphism x â¦ x* (namely the
complex conjugation), such that xâx* is in P for any nonzero x in C.
Any field F with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking the
sets B(x,âp) = {ây | p â (y â x)(y â x)* â Pâ}â as a base,
where x ranges over the field and p ranges over P. With this topology F is
isomorphic as a topological field to C.
The only connected locally_compact topological_fields are R and C. This gives
another characterization of C as a topological field, since C can be
distinguished from R because the nonzero complex numbers are connected, while
the nonzero real numbers are not.[30]
***** Formal construction[edit] *****
**** Construction as ordered pairs[edit] ****
William_Rowan_Hamilton introduced the approach to define the set C of complex
numbers[31] as the set R2 of ordered_pairs (a,âb) of real numbers, in which
the following rules for addition and multiplication are imposed:[32]
             ( a , b ) + ( c , d )    = ( a + c , b + d )     ( a , b )
      &#x22C5; ( c , d )    = ( a c &#x2212; b d , b c + a d ) .
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(a,b)+(c,d)&=(a+c,b+d)\\(a,b)\cdot (c,d)&=
      (ac-bd,bc+ad).\end{aligned}}}  [{\begin{aligned}(a,b)+(c,d)&=(a+c,b+d)\\
      (a,b)\cdot (c,d)&=(ac-bd,bc+ad).\end{aligned}}]
It is then just a matter of notation to express (a,âb) as a + bi.
**** Construction as a quotient field[edit] ****
Though this low-level construction does accurately describe the structure of
the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition reveals the algebraic
nature of C more immediately. This characterization relies on the notion of
fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed with addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division operations that behave as is familiar from, say,
rational numbers. For example, the distributive_law
         ( x + y ) z = x z + y z   {\displaystyle (x+y)z=xz+yz}  [(x+y)z=xz+yz]
must hold for any three elements x, y and z of a field. The set R of real
numbers does form a field. A polynomial p(X) with real coefficients is an
expression of the form
          a  n    X  n   + &#x22EF; +  a  1   X +  a  0     {\displaystyle a_
      {n}X^{n}+\dotsb +a_{1}X+a_{0}}  [a_{n}X^{n}+\dotsb +a_{1}X+a_{0}],
where the a0, ...,âan are real numbers. The usual addition and multiplication
of polynomials endows the set R[X] of all such polynomials with a ring
structure. This ring is called the polynomial_ring over the real numbers.
The set of complex numbers is defined as the quotient_ring R[X]/(X 2 + 1).[33]
This extension field contains two square roots of â1, namely (the cosets of)
X and âX, respectively. (The cosets of) 1 and X form a basis of R[X]/(X 2 +
1) as a real vector_space, which means that each element of the extension field
can be uniquely written as a linear_combination in these two elements.
Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered pairs
(a,âb) of real numbers. The quotient ring is a field, because X2 + 1 is
irreducible over R, so the ideal it generates is maximal.
The formulas for addition and multiplication in the ring R[X], modulo the
relation X2 = â1, correspond to the formulas for addition and multiplication
of complex numbers defined as ordered pairs. So the two definitions of the
field C are isomorphic (as fields).
Accepting that C is algebraically closed, since it is an algebraic_extension of
R in this approach, C is therefore the algebraic_closure of R.
**** Matrix representation of complex numbers[edit] ****
Complex numbers a + bi can also be represented by 2âÃâ2 matrices that have
the following form:
           (    a   &#x2212; b     b     a    )     {\displaystyle {\begin
      {pmatrix}a&-b\\b&\;\;a\end{pmatrix}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin
      {pmatrix}a&-b\\b&\;\;a\end{pmatrix}}}]
Here the entries a and b are real numbers. The sum and product of two such
matrices is again of this form, and the sum and product of complex numbers
corresponds to the sum and product of such matrices, the product being:
           (    a   &#x2212; b     b     a    )     (    c   &#x2212; d     d
      c    )   =   (    a c &#x2212; b d   &#x2212; a d &#x2212; b c     b c +
      a d     &#x2212; b d + a c    )     {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&-
      b\\b&\;\;a\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}c&-d\\d&\;\;c\end{pmatrix}}=
      {\begin{pmatrix}ac-bd&-ad-bc\\bc+ad&\;\;-bd+ac\end{pmatrix}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&-b\\b&\;\;a\end{pmatrix}}{\begin
      {pmatrix}c&-d\\d&\;\;c\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}ac-bd&-ad-
      bc\\bc+ad&\;\;-bd+ac\end{pmatrix}}}]
The geometric description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be
expressed in terms of rotation_matrices by using this correspondence between
complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover, the square of the absolute value
of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the determinant of that
matrix:
          |  z   |   2   =   |    a   &#x2212; b     b   a    |   =  a  2   +
      b  2   .   {\displaystyle |z|^{2}={\begin{vmatrix}a&-b\\b&a\end
      {vmatrix}}=a^{2}+b^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle |z|^{2}={\begin{vmatrix}a&-
      b\\b&a\end{vmatrix}}=a^{2}+b^{2}.}]
The conjugate       z &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle {\overline {z}}}  [{\overline
{z}}] corresponds to the transpose of the matrix.
Though this representation of complex numbers with matrices is the most common,
many other representations arise from matrices other than       (        0
&#x2212; 1     1   0        )     {\displaystyle {\bigl (}{\begin
{smallmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{smallmatrix}}{\bigr )}}  [{\bigl (}{\begin
{smallmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{smallmatrix}}{\bigr )}] that square to the negative
of the identity_matrix. See the article on 2_Ã_2_real_matrices for other
representations of complex numbers.

of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in real_analysis
or even number_theory employ techniques from complex analysis (see prime_number
theorem for an example). Unlike real functions, which are commonly represented
as two-dimensional graphs, complex_functions have four-dimensional graphs and
may usefully be illustrated by color-coding a three-dimensional_graph to
suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic
transformation of the complex plane.
**** Complex exponential and related functions[edit] ****
The notions of convergent_series and continuous_functions in (real) analysis
have natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence of complex numbers is said
to converge if and only if its real and imaginary parts do. This is equivalent
to the (Îµ,_Î´)-definition_of_limits, where the absolute value of real numbers
is replaced by the one of complex numbers. From a more abstract point of view,
C, endowed with the metric
         d &#x2061; (  z  1   ,  z  2   ) =  |   z  1   &#x2212;  z  2    |
      {\displaystyle \operatorname {d} (z_{1},z_{2})=|z_{1}-z_{2}|}  [
      {\displaystyle \operatorname {d} (z_{1},z_{2})=|z_{1}-z_{2}|}]
is a complete metric_space, which notably includes the triangle_inequality
          |   z  1   +  z  2    |  &#x2264;  |   z  1    |  +  |   z  2    |
      {\displaystyle |z_{1}+z_{2}|\leq |z_{1}|+|z_{2}|}  [|z_{1}+z_{2}|\leq |z_
      {1}|+|z_{2}|]
for any two complex numbers z1 and z2.
Like in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a number
of elementary_functions: the exponential_function exp(z), also written ez, is
defined as the infinite_series
         exp &#x2061; ( z ) := 1 + z +    z  2    2 &#x22C5; 1    +    z  3
      3 &#x22C5; 2 &#x22C5; 1    + &#x22EF; =  &#x2211;  n = 0   &#x221E;
      z  n    n !    .   {\displaystyle \exp(z):=1+z+{\frac {z^{2}}{2\cdot 1}}+
      {\frac {z^{3}}{3\cdot 2\cdot 1}}+\cdots =\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {z^
      {n}}{n!}}.}  [{\displaystyle \exp(z):=1+z+{\frac {z^{2}}{2\cdot 1}}+
      {\frac {z^{3}}{3\cdot 2\cdot 1}}+\cdots =\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {z^
      {n}}{n!}}.}]
The series defining the real trigonometric functions sine and cosine, as well
as the hyperbolic_functions sinh and cosh, also carry over to complex arguments
without change. For the other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, such as
tangent, things are slightly more complicated, as the defining series do not
converge for all complex values. Therefore, one must define them either in
terms of sine, cosine and exponential, or, equivalently, by using the method of
analytic_continuation.
Euler's_formula states:
         exp &#x2061; ( i &#x03C6; ) = cos &#x2061; ( &#x03C6; ) + i sin
      &#x2061; ( &#x03C6; )   {\displaystyle \exp(i\varphi )=\cos(\varphi
      )+i\sin(\varphi )}  [{\displaystyle \exp(i\varphi )=\cos(\varphi )+i\sin
      (\varphi )}]
for any real number Ï, in particular
         exp &#x2061; ( i &#x03C0; ) = &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle \exp(i\pi
      )=-1}  [{\displaystyle \exp(i\pi )=-1}]
Unlike in the situation of real numbers, there is an infinitude of complex
solutions z of the equation
         exp &#x2061; ( z ) = w   {\displaystyle \exp(z)=w}  [{\displaystyle
      \exp(z)=w}]
for any complex number w â  0. It can be shown that any such solution z â
called complex_logarithm of w â satisfies
         log &#x2061; ( w ) = ln &#x2061;  |  w  |  + i arg &#x2061; ( w ) ,
      {\displaystyle \log(w)=\ln |w|+i\arg(w),}  [{\displaystyle \log(w)=\ln
      |w|+i\arg(w),}]
where arg is the argument defined above, and ln the (real) natural_logarithm.
As arg is a multivalued_function, unique only up to a multiple of 2Ï, log is
also multivalued. The principal_value of log is often taken by restricting the
imaginary part to the interval (âÏ, Ï].
Complex exponentiation zÏ is defined as
          z  &#x03C9;   = exp &#x2061; ( &#x03C9; log &#x2061; z ) ,
      {\displaystyle z^{\omega }=\exp(\omega \log z),}  [{\displaystyle z^
      {\omega }=\exp(\omega \log z),}]
and is multi-valued, except when     &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle \omega }
[\omega ] is an integer. For Ï = 1 / n, for some natural number n, this
recovers the non-uniqueness of nth roots mentioned above.
Complex numbers, unlike real numbers, do not in general satisfy the unmodified
power and logarithm identities, particularly when naÃ¯vely treated as single-
valued functions; see failure_of_power_and_logarithm_identities. For example,
they do not satisfy
          a  b c   =   (  a  b   )   c   .   {\displaystyle a^{bc}=\left(a^
      {b}\right)^{c}.}  [{\displaystyle a^{bc}=\left(a^{b}\right)^{c}.}]
Both sides of the equation are multivalued by the definition of complex
exponentiation given here, and the values on the left are a subset of those on
the right.
**** Holomorphic functions[edit] ****
A function f : C â C is called holomorphic if it satisfies the
CauchyâRiemann_equations. For example, any R-linear map C â C can be
written in the form
         f ( z ) = a z + b   z &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle f(z)=az+b{\overline
      {z}}}  [f(z)=az+b{\overline {z}}]
with complex coefficients a and b. This map is holomorphic if_and_only_if b =
0. The second summand     b   z &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle b{\overline {z}}}
[b{\overline {z}}] is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the
CauchyâRiemann_equations.
Complex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For
example, any two holomorphic functions f and g that agree on an arbitrarily
small open_subset of C necessarily agree everywhere. Meromorphic_functions,
functions that can locally be written as f(z)/(z â z0)n with a holomorphic
function f, still share some of the features of holomorphic functions. Other
functions have essential_singularities, such as sin(1/z) at z = 0.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Complex numbers have applications in many scientific areas, including signal
processing, control_theory, electromagnetism, fluid_dynamics, quantum
mechanics, cartography, and vibration_analysis. Some of these applications are
described below.
**** Geometry[edit] ****
*** Shapes[edit] ***
Three non-collinear points     u , v , w   {\displaystyle u,v,w}  [u,v,w] in
the plane determine the shape of the triangle     { u , v , w }
{\displaystyle \{u,v,w\}}  [{\displaystyle \{u,v,w\}}]. Locating the points in
the complex plane, this shape of a triangle may be expressed by complex
arithmetic as
         S ( u , v , w ) =    u &#x2212; w   u &#x2212; v    .   {\displaystyle
      S(u,v,w)={\frac {u-w}{u-v}}.}  [{\displaystyle S(u,v,w)={\frac {u-w}{u-
      v}}.}]
The shape     S   {\displaystyle S}  [S] of a triangle will remain the same,
when the complex plane is transformed by translation or dilation (by an affine
transformation), corresponding to the intuitive notion of shape, and describing
similarity. Thus each triangle     { u , v , w }   {\displaystyle \{u,v,w\}}  [
{\displaystyle \{u,v,w\}}] is in a similarity_class of triangles with the same
shape.[34]
*** Fractal geometry[edit] ***
The Mandelbrot set with the real and imaginary axes labeled.
The Mandelbrot_set is a popular example of a fractal formed on the complex
plane. It is defined by plotting every location     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c]
where iterating the sequence      f  c   ( z ) =  z  2   + c   {\displaystyle
f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}  [{\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}] does not diverge when
iterated infinitely. Similarly, Julia_sets have the same rules, except where
c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] remains constant.
*** Triangles[edit] ***
Every triangle has a unique Steiner_inellipse â an ellipse inside the
triangle and tangent to the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. The
foci of a triangle's Steiner inellipse can be found as follows, according to
Marden's_theorem:[35][36] Denote the triangle's vertices in the complex plane
as a = xA + yAi, b = xB + yBi, and c = xC + yCi. Write the cubic_equation
( x &#x2212; a ) ( x &#x2212; b ) ( x &#x2212; c ) = 0    {\displaystyle
\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0}  [\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0], take its
derivative, and equate the (quadratic) derivative to zero. Marden's_Theorem
says that the solutions of this equation are the complex numbers denoting the
locations of the two foci of the Steiner inellipse.
**** Algebraic number theory[edit] ****
Construction of a regular pentagon using_straightedge_and_compass.
As mentioned above, any nonconstant polynomial equation (in complex
coefficients) has a solution in C. A fortiori, the same is true if the equation
has rational coefficients. The roots of such equations are called algebraic
numbers â they are a principal object of study in algebraic_number_theory.
Compared to Q, the algebraic closure of Q, which also contains all algebraic
numbers, C has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms.
In this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and
vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the machinery of
field_theory to the number_field containing roots_of_unity, it can be shown
that it is not possible to construct a regular nonagon using_only_compass_and
straightedge â a purely geometric problem.
Another example are Gaussian_integers, that is, numbers of the form x + iy,
where x and y are integers, which can be used to classify sums_of_squares.
**** Analytic number theory[edit] ****
Main article: Analytic_number_theory
Analytic number theory studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by taking
advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex numbers, in which
analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding number-theoretic
information in complex-valued functions. For example, the Riemann_zeta_function
Î¶(s) is related to the distribution of prime_numbers.
**** Improper integrals[edit] ****
In applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain real-
valued improper_integrals, by means of complex-valued functions. Several
methods exist to do this; see methods_of_contour_integration.
**** Dynamic equations[edit] ****
In differential_equations, it is common to first find all complex roots r of
the characteristic_equation of a linear_differential_equation or equation
system and then attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the
form f(t) = ert. Likewise, in difference_equations, the complex roots r of the
characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to attempt
to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form f(t) = rt.
**** In applied mathematics[edit] ****
*** Control theory[edit] ***
In control_theory, systems are often transformed from the time_domain to the
frequency_domain using the Laplace_transform. The system's zeros_and_poles are
then analyzed in the complex plane. The root_locus, Nyquist_plot, and Nichols
plot techniques all make use of the complex plane.
In the root locus method, it is important whether zeros and poles are in the
left or right half planes, i.e. have real part greater than or less than zero.
If a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system has poles that are
    * in the right half plane, it will be unstable,
    * all in the left half plane, it will be stable,
    * on the imaginary axis, it will have marginal_stability.
If a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a nonminimum_phase system.
*** Signal analysis[edit] ***
Complex numbers are used in signal_analysis and other fields for a convenient
description for periodically varying signals. For given real functions
representing actual physical quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines,
corresponding complex functions are considered of which the real parts are the
original quantities. For a sine_wave of a given frequency, the absolute value
|z| of the corresponding z is the amplitude and the argument arg(z) is the
phase.
If Fourier_analysis is employed to write a given real-valued signal as a sum of
periodic functions, these periodic functions are often written as complex
valued functions of the form
         x ( t ) = Re &#x2061; { X ( t ) }   {\displaystyle x(t)=\operatorname
      {Re} \{X(t)\}}  [{\displaystyle x(t)=\operatorname {Re} \{X(t)\}}]
and
         X ( t ) = A  e  i &#x03C9; t   = a  e  i &#x03D5;    e  i &#x03C9; t
      = a  e  i ( &#x03C9; t + &#x03D5; )     {\displaystyle X(t)=Ae^{i\omega
      t}=ae^{i\phi }e^{i\omega t}=ae^{i(\omega t+\phi )}}  [{\displaystyle X
      (t)=Ae^{i\omega t}=ae^{i\phi }e^{i\omega t}=ae^{i(\omega t+\phi )}}]
where Ï represents the angular_frequency and the complex number A encodes the
phase and amplitude as explained above.
This use is also extended into digital_signal_processing and digital_image
processing, which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and wavelet
analysis) to transmit, compress, restore, and otherwise process digital audio
signals, still images, and video signals.
Another example, relevant to the two side bands of amplitude_modulation of AM
radio, is:
             cos &#x2061; ( ( &#x03C9; + &#x03B1; ) t ) + cos &#x2061;  (
      ( &#x03C9; &#x2212; &#x03B1; ) t  )     = Re &#x2061;  (   e  i
      ( &#x03C9; + &#x03B1; ) t   +  e  i ( &#x03C9; &#x2212; &#x03B1; ) t    )
      = Re &#x2061;  (   (   e  i &#x03B1; t   +  e  &#x2212; i &#x03B1; t    )
      &#x22C5;  e  i &#x03C9; t    )        = Re &#x2061;  (  2 cos &#x2061;
      ( &#x03B1; t ) &#x22C5;  e  i &#x03C9; t    )        = 2 cos &#x2061;
      ( &#x03B1; t ) &#x22C5; Re &#x2061;  (  e  i &#x03C9; t   )        = 2
      cos &#x2061; ( &#x03B1; t ) &#x22C5; cos &#x2061;  (  &#x03C9; t  )  .
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\cos((\omega +\alpha )t)+\cos \left(
      (\omega -\alpha )t\right)&=\operatorname {Re} \left(e^{i(\omega +\alpha
      )t}+e^{i(\omega -\alpha )t}\right)\\&=\operatorname {Re} \left(\left(e^
      {i\alpha t}+e^{-i\alpha t}\right)\cdot e^{i\omega

      t}\right)\\&=2\cos(\alpha t)\cdot \cos \left(\omega t\right).\end
      {aligned}}}]
**** In physics[edit] ****
*** Electromagnetism and electrical engineering[edit] ***
Main article: Alternating_current
In electrical_engineering, the Fourier_transform is used to analyze varying
voltages and currents. The treatment of resistors, capacitors, and inductors
can then be unified by introducing imaginary, frequency-dependent resistances
for the latter two and combining all three in a single complex number called
the impedance. This approach is called phasor calculus.
In electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by j, to avoid
confusion with I, which is generally in use to denote electric_current, or,
more particularly, i, which is generally in use to denote instantaneous
electric current.
Since the voltage in an AC circuit is oscillating, it can be represented as
         V ( t ) =  V  0    e  j &#x03C9; t   =  V  0    (  cos &#x2061;
      &#x03C9; t + j sin &#x2061; &#x03C9; t  )  ,   {\displaystyle V(t)=V_
      {0}e^{j\omega t}=V_{0}\left(\cos \omega t+j\sin \omega t\right),}  [
      {\displaystyle V(t)=V_{0}e^{j\omega t}=V_{0}\left(\cos \omega t+j\sin
      \omega t\right),}]
To obtain the measurable quantity, the real part is taken:
         v ( t ) =  R e  ( V ) =  R e   [   V  0    e  j &#x03C9; t    ]  =  V
      0   cos &#x2061; &#x03C9; t .   {\displaystyle v(t)=\mathrm {Re}
      (V)=\mathrm {Re} \left[V_{0}e^{j\omega t}\right]=V_{0}\cos \omega t.}  [v
      (t)=\mathrm {Re} (V)=\mathrm {Re} \left[V_{0}e^{j\omega t}\right]=V_
      {0}\cos \omega t.]
The complex-valued signal     V ( t )   {\displaystyle V(t)}  [V(t)] is called
the analytic representation of the real-valued, measurable signal     v ( t )
{\displaystyle v(t)}  [v(t)]. [37]
*** Fluid dynamics[edit] ***
In fluid_dynamics, complex functions are used to describe potential_flow_in_two
dimensions.
*** Quantum mechanics[edit] ***
The complex number field is intrinsic to the mathematical_formulations_of
quantum_mechanics, where complex Hilbert_spaces provide the context for one
such formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original
foundation formulas of quantum mechanics â the SchrÃ¶dinger_equation and
Heisenberg's matrix_mechanics â make use of complex numbers.
*** Relativity[edit] ***
In special and general_relativity, some formulas for the metric on spacetime
become simpler if one takes the time component of the spacetime continuum to be
imaginary. (This approach is no longer standard in classical relativity, but is
used_in_an_essential_way in quantum_field_theory.) Complex numbers are
essential to spinors, which are a generalization of the tensors used in
relativity.
***** Generalizations and related notions[edit] *****
The process of extending the field R of reals to C is known as the
CayleyâDickson_construction. It can be carried further to higher dimensions,
yielding the quaternions H and octonions O which (as a real vector space) are
of dimension 4 and 8, respectively. In this context the complex numbers have
been called the binarions.[38]
Just as by applying the construction to reals the property of ordering is lost,
properties familiar from real and complex numbers vanish with each extension.
The quaternions lose commutativity, i.e.: xÂ·y â  yÂ·x for some quaternions
x,ây, and the multiplication of octonions, additionally to not being
commutative, fails to be associative: (xÂ·y)Â·z â  xÂ·(yÂ·z) for some
octonions x,ây,âz.
Reals, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are all normed_division
algebras over R. By Hurwitz's_theorem they are the only ones; the sedenions,
the next step in the CayleyâDickson construction, fail to have this
structure.
The CayleyâDickson construction is closely related to the regular
representation of C, thought of as an R-algebra (an R-vector space with a
multiplication), with respect to the basis (1,âi). This means the following:
the R-linear map
          C  &#x2192;  C  , z &#x21A6; w z   {\displaystyle \mathbb {C}
      \rightarrow \mathbb {C} ,z\mapsto wz}  [\mathbb {C} \rightarrow \mathbb
      {C} ,z\mapsto wz]
for some fixed complex number w can be represented by a 2âÃâ2 matrix (once
a basis has been chosen). With respect to the basis (1,âi), this matrix is
           (    Re &#x2061; ( w )   &#x2212; Im &#x2061; ( w )     Im &#x2061;
      ( w )     Re &#x2061; ( w )    )     {\displaystyle {\begin
      {pmatrix}\operatorname {Re} (w)&-\operatorname {Im} (w)\\\operatorname
      {Im} (w)&\;\;\operatorname {Re} (w)\end{pmatrix}}}  [{\begin
      {pmatrix}\operatorname {Re} (w)&-\operatorname {Im} (w)\\\operatorname
      {Im} (w)&\;\;\operatorname {Re} (w)\end{pmatrix}}]
i.e., the one mentioned in the section on matrix representation of complex
numbers above. While this is a linear_representation of C in the 2_Ã_2_real
matrices, it is not the only one. Any matrix
         J =   (    p   q     r   &#x2212; p    )   ,   p  2   + q r + 1 = 0
      {\displaystyle J={\begin{pmatrix}p&q\\r&-p\end{pmatrix}},\quad p^
      {2}+qr+1=0}  [J={\begin{pmatrix}p&q\\r&-p\end{pmatrix}},\quad p^
      {2}+qr+1=0]
has the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix: J2 =
âI. Then
         { z = a I + b J : a , b &#x2208;  R  }   {\displaystyle \{z=aI+bJ:
      a,b\in \mathbf {R} \}}  [{\displaystyle \{z=aI+bJ:a,b\in \mathbf {R} \}}]
is also isomorphic to the field C, and gives an alternative complex structure
on R2. This is generalized by the notion of a linear_complex_structure.
Hypercomplex_numbers also generalize R, C, H, and O. For example, this notion
contains the split-complex_numbers, which are elements of the ring R[x]/(x2 â
1) (as opposed to R[x]/(x2 + 1)). In this ring, the equation a2 = 1 has four
solutions.
The field R is the completion of Q, the field of rational_numbers, with respect
to the usual absolute_value metric. Other choices of metrics on Q lead to the
fields Qp of p-adic_numbers (for any prime_number p), which are thereby
analogous to R. There are no other nontrivial ways of completing Q than R and
Qp, by Ostrowski's_theorem. The algebraic closures         Q   p   &#x00AF;
{\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbf {Q} _{p}}}}  [{\overline {\mathbf {Q} _
{p}}}] of Qp still carry a norm, but (unlike C) are not complete with respect
to it. The completion       C   p     {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} _{p}}
[\mathbf {C} _{p}] of         Q   p   &#x00AF;     {\displaystyle {\overline
{\mathbf {Q} _{p}}}}  [{\overline {\mathbf {Q} _{p}}}] turns out to be
algebraically closed. This field is called p-adic complex numbers by analogy.
The fields R and Qp and their finite field extensions, including C, are local
fields.

      {\displaystyle (q/2)^{2}-(p/3)^{3}}  [(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3] is negative (casus
      irreducibilis), the second cube root should be regarded as the complex
      conjugate of the first one.

   3. Extract_of_p._73: "complex numbers, as much as reals, and perhaps even
      more, find a unity with nature that is truly remarkable. It is as though
      Nature herself is as impressed by the scope and consistency of the
      complex-number system as we are ourselves, and has entrusted to these
      numbers the precise operations of her world at its minutest scales."
