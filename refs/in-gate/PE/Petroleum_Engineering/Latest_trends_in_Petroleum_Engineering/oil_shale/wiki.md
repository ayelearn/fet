Oil shale is an organic-rich fine-grained sedimentary_rock containing kerogen
(a solid mixture of organic_chemical_compounds) from which liquid hydrocarbons
can be produced, called shale_oil (not to be confused with tight_oilâcrude
oil occurring naturally in shales). Shale oil is a substitute for conventional
crude oil; however, extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the
production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its
environmental_impact.[1] Deposits of oil shale occur around the world,
including major deposits in the United_States. A 2016 estimate of global
deposits set the total world resources of oil shale equivalent of 6.05 trillion
barrels (962 billion cubic metres) of oil_in_place.[2]
Heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature causes the chemical
process of pyrolysis to yield a vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale
oilâan unconventional_oilâis separated from combustible oil-shale_gas (the
term shale_gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale
can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power
generation and district_heating or used as a raw material in chemical and
construction-materials processing.[3]
Oil shale gains attention as a potential abundant source of oil whenever the
price of crude oil rises.[4][5] At the same time, oil-shale mining and
processing raise a number of environmental concerns, such as land_use, waste
disposal, water_use, waste-water_management, greenhouse-gas_emissions and air
pollution.[6][7] Estonia and China have well-established oil shale industries,
and Brazil, Germany, and Russia also utilize oil shale.[8]
General composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix, bitumens, and
kerogen. Oil shales differ from oil-bearing shales, shale deposits that contain
petroleum (tight_oil) that is sometimes produced from drilled wells. Examples
of oil-bearing shales are the Bakken_Formation, Pierre_Shale, Niobrara
Formation, and Eagle_Ford_Formation.

Main article: Oil_shale_geology
Outcrop of Ordovician oil shale (kukersite), northern Estonia
Oil shale, an organic-rich sedimentary rock, belongs to the group of sapropel
fuels.[9] It does not have a definite geological definition nor a specific
chemical formula, and its seams do not always have discrete boundaries. Oil
shales vary considerably in their mineral content, chemical composition, age,
type of kerogen, and depositional history and not all oil shales would
necessarily be classified as shales in the strict sense.[10][11] According to
the petrologist Adrian C. Hutton of the University_of_Wollongong, oil shales
are not "geological nor geochemically distinctive rock but rather 'economic'
term."[12] Their common defining feature is low solubility in low-boiling
organic solvents and generation of liquid organic products on thermal
decomposition.[13]
Oil shale differs from bitumen-impregnated_rocks (oil_sands and petroleum
reservoir rocks), humic coals and carbonaceous shale. While oil sands do
originate from the biodegradation of oil, heat and pressure have not (yet)
transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum, that means that its
maturation does not exceed early mesocatagenetic.[13][14][15]
General composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix, bitumens, and
kerogen. While the bitumen portion of oil shales is soluble in carbon
disulfide, kerogen portion is insoluble in carbon disulfide and may contain
iron, vanadium, nickel, molybdenum, and uranium.[16] Oil shale contains a lower
percentage of organic matter than coal. In commercial grades of oil shale the
ratio of organic matter to mineral matter lies approximately between 0.75:5 and
1.5:5. At the same time, the organic matter in oil shale has an atomic ratio of
hydrogen to carbon (H/C) approximately 1.2 to 1.8 times lower than for crude
oil and about 1.5 to 3 times higher than for coals.[9][17][18] The organic
components of oil shale derive from a variety of organisms, such as the remains
of algae, spores, pollen, plant_cuticles and corky fragments of herbaceous and
woody plants, and cellular debris from other aquatic and land plants.[17][19]
Some deposits contain significant fossils; Germany's Messel_Pit has the status
of a Unesco_World_Heritage_Site. The mineral matter in oil shale includes
various fine-grained silicates and carbonates.[3][9] Inorganic matrix can
contain quartz, feldspars, clays (mainly illite and chlorite), carbonates
(calcite and dolomites), pyrite and some other minerals.[16]
Geologists can classify oil shales on the basis of their composition as
carbonate-rich shales, siliceous shales, or cannel shales.[20]
Another classification, known as the van Krevelen diagram, assigns kerogen
types, depending on the hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen content of oil shales'
original organic matter.[11] The most commonly used classification of oil
shales, developed between 1987 and 1991 by Adrian C. Hutton, adapts
petrographic terms from coal terminology. This classification designates oil
shales as terrestrial, lacustrine (lake-bottom-deposited), or marine (ocean
bottom-deposited), based on the environment of the initial biomass deposit.[3]
[21] Known oil shales are predominantly aquatic (marine, lacustrine) origin.
[13][21] Hutton's classification scheme has proven useful in estimating the
yield and composition of the extracted oil.[22]

Main article: Oil_shale_reserves
Fossils in Ordovician oil shale (kukersite), northern Estonia
As source rocks for most conventional oil_reservoirs, oil shale deposits are
found in all world oil provinces, although most of them are too deep to be
exploited economically.[23] As with all oil and gas resources, analysts
distinguish between oil shale resources and oil shale reserves. "Resources"
refers to all oil shale deposits, while "reserves", represents those deposits
from which producers can extract oil shale economically using existing
technology. Since extraction technologies develop continuously, planners can
only estimate the amount of recoverable kerogen.[1][3] Although resources of
oil shale occur in many countries, only 33 countries possess known deposits of
possible economic value .[24][25] Well-explored deposits, potentially
classifiable as reserves, include the Green_River deposits in the western
United States, the Tertiary deposits in Queensland, Australia, deposits in
Sweden and Estonia, the El-Lajjun deposit in Jordan, and deposits in France,
Germany, Brazil, China, southern Mongolia and Russia. These deposits have given
rise to expectations of yielding at least 40 liters of shale oil per tonne of
oil shale, using the Fischer_Assay.[3][11]
A 2016 estimate set the total world resources of oil shale equivalent to yield
of 6.05 trillion barrels (962 billion cubic metres) of shale oil, with the
largest resource deposits in the United_States accounting more than 80% of the
world total resource.[2] For comparison, at the same time the world's proven
oil_reserves are estimated to be 1.6976 trillion barrels (269.90 billion cubic
metres).[26] The largest deposits in the world occur in the United States in
the Green_River_Formation, which covers portions of Colorado, Utah, and
Wyoming; about 70% of this resource lies on land owned or managed by the United
States federal government.[27] Deposits in the United States constitute more
than 80% of world resources; other significant resource holders being China,
Russia, and Brazil.[2]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_the_oil_shale_industry

Pierre Allix, Alan K. Burnham.[28]
Humans have used oil shale as a fuel since prehistoric times, since it
generally burns without any processing.[29] Britons of the Iron_Age also used
to polish it and form it into ornaments.[30] The first patent for extracting
oil from oil shale was British Crown Patent 330 granted in 1694 to three
persons named Martin Eele, Thomas Hancock and William Portlock who had "found a
way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tarr, and oyle out of a sort
of stone."[31][32][33]
Autun oil shale mines
Modern industrial mining of oil shale began in 1837 in Autun, France, followed
by exploitation in Scotland, Germany, and several other countries.[34][35]
Operations during the 19th century focused on the production of kerosene, lamp
oil, and paraffin; these products helped supply the growing demand for lighting
that arose during the Industrial_Revolution.[36] Fuel oil, lubricating oil and
grease, and ammonium_sulfate were also produced.[37] The European oil-shale
industry expanded immediately before World_War_I due to limited access to
conventional petroleum resources and to the mass production of automobiles and
trucks, which accompanied an increase in gasoline consumption.
Although the Estonian and Chinese oil-shale industries continued to grow after
World_War_II, most other countries abandoned their projects due to high
processing costs and the availability of cheaper petroleum.[3][35][38][39]
Following the 1973_oil_crisis, world production of oil shale reached a peak of
46 million tonnes in 1980 before falling to about 16 million tonnes in 2000,
due to competition from cheap_conventional_petroleum_in_the_1980s.[6][24]
On 2 May 1982, known in some circles as "Black Sunday", Exxon canceled its
US$5 billion Colony_Shale_Oil_Project near Parachute,_Colorado because of low
oil-prices and increased expenses, laying off more than 2,000 workers and
leaving a trail of home-foreclosures and small-business bankruptcies.[40] In
1986, President Ronald_Reagan signed into law the Consolidated_Omnibus_Budget
Reconciliation_Act_of_1985 which among other things abolished the United
States' Synthetic_Liquid_Fuels_Program.[41]
The global oil-shale industry began to revive at the beginning of the 21st
century. In 2003, an oil-shale development program restarted in the United
States. Authorities introduced a commercial leasing program permitting the
extraction of oil shale and oil sands on federal lands in 2005, in accordance
with the Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005.[42][43]

As of 2008[update], industry uses oil shale in Brazil, China, Estonia and to
some extent in Germany, and Russia. Several additional countries started
assessing their reserves or had built experimental production plants, while
others had phased out their oil shale industry.[8] Oil shale serves for oil
production in Estonia, Brazil, and China; for power generation in Estonia,
China, and Germany; for cement production in Estonia, Germany, and China; and
for use in chemical industries in China, Estonia, and Russia.[8][39][44][45]
As of 2009[update], 80% of oil shale used globally is extracted_in_Estonia,
mainly due to the Oil-shale-fired_power_plants.[44][46] Oil-shale-fired power
plants occur in Estonia, which has an installed capacity of 2,967 megawatts
(MW), China (12 MW), and Germany (9.9 MW).[24][47] Israel, Romania and Russia
have in the past run power_plants fired by oil shale, but have shut them down
or switched to other fuel sources such as natural_gas.[8][24][48] Jordan and
Egypt plan to construct power plants fired by oil shale, while Canada and
Turkey plan to burn oil shale along with coal for power generation.[24][49] Oil
shale serves as the main fuel for power generation only in Estonia, where 90.3%
of country's electrical generation in 2016 was produced from oil shale.[50]
According to the World_Energy_Council, in 2008 the total production of shale
oil from oil shale was 930,000 tonnes, equal to 17,700 barrels per day
(2,810 m3/d), of which China produced 375,000 tonnes, Estonia 355,000 tonnes,
and Brazil 200,000 tonnes.[51] In comparison, production of the conventional
oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 amounted 3.95 billion tonnes or 82.1
million barrels per day (13.1Ã10^6 m3/d).[52]

Overview of shale oil extraction.
Mining of oil shale. VKG Ojamaa.
Most exploitation of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere,
after which one can burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or
undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface_mining involve
open_pit_mining and strip_mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying
material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the
deposits occur near the surface. Underground_mining_of_oil_shale, which removes
less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar_method.[53]
The extraction of the useful components of oil shale usually takes place above
ground (ex-situ processing), although several newer technologies perform this
underground (on-site or in-situ processing).[54] In either case, the chemical
process of pyrolysis converts the kerogen in the oil shale to shale oil
(synthetic_crude oil) and oil shale gas. Most conversion technologies involve
heating shale in the absence of oxygen to a temperature at which kerogen
decomposes (pyrolyses) into gas, condensable oil, and a solid residue. This
usually takes place between 450 Â°C (842 Â°F) and 500 Â°C (932 Â°F).[1] The
process of decomposition begins at relatively low temperatures (300 Â°C or
572 Â°F), but proceeds more rapidly and more completely at higher temperatures.
[55]
In-situ processing involves heating the oil shale underground. Such
technologies can potentially extract more oil from a given area of land than
ex-situ processes, since they can access the material at greater depths than
surface mines can. Several companies have patented methods for in-situ
retorting. However, most of these methods remain in the experimental phase. One
can distinguish true in-situ processes (TIS) and modified in-situ processes
(MIS). True in-situ processes do not involve mining the oil shale. Modified in-
situ processes involve removing part of the oil shale and bringing it to the
surface for modified in-situ retorting in order to create permeability for gas
flow in a rubble chimney. Explosives rubblize the oil-shale deposit.[56]
Hundreds of patents for oil shale retorting technologies exist;[57] however,
only a few dozen have undergone testing. By 2006, only four technologies
remained in commercial use: Kiviter, Galoter, Fushun, and Petrosix.[58]
***** Applications and products[edit] *****
Industry can use oil shale as a fuel for thermal power-plants, burning it (like
coal) to drive steam_turbines; some of these plants employ_the_resulting_heat
for district_heating of homes and businesses. In addition to its use as a fuel,
oil shale may also serve in the production of specialty carbon_fibers,
adsorbent_carbons, carbon_black, phenols, resins, glues, tanning agents,
mastic, road bitumen, cement, bricks, construction and decorative blocks, soil-
additives, fertilizers, rock-wool insulation, glass, and pharmaceutical
products.[44] However, oil shale use for production of these items remains
small or only in its experimental stages.[3][59] Some oil shales yield sulfur,
ammonia, alumina, soda_ash, uranium, and nahcolite as shale-oil extraction
byproducts. Between 1946 and 1952, a marine type of Dictyonema shale served for
uranium production in SillamÃ¤e, Estonia, and between 1950 and 1989 Sweden used
alum shale for the same purposes.[3] Oil shale gas has served as a substitute
for natural_gas, but as of 2009[update], producing oil shale gas as a natural-
gas substitute remained economically infeasible.[60][61]
The shale oil derived from oil shale does not directly substitute for crude oil
in all applications. It may contain higher concentrations of olefins, oxygen,
and nitrogen than conventional crude oil.[41] Some shale oils may have higher
sulfur or arsenic content. By comparison with West_Texas_Intermediate, the
benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures-contract market, the Green
River shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0% to 4.9% (in average 0.76%),
where West Texas Intermediate's sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42%.[62] The
sulfur content in shale oil from Jordan's oil shales may rise even up to 9.5%.
[63] The arsenic content, for example, becomes an issue for Green River
formation oil shale. The higher concentrations of these materials means that
the oil must undergo considerable upgrading (hydrotreating) before serving as
oil-refinery feedstock.[64] Above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a
lower API_gravity shale oil than the in situ processes. Shale oil serves best
for producing middle-distillates such as kerosene, jet_fuel, and diesel_fuel.
Worldwide demand for these middle distillates, particularly for diesel fuels,
increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s.[41][65] However, appropriate refining
processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter-
range hydrocarbon (gasoline).[41]
***** Economics[edit] *****
Main article: Oil_shale_economics
The amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown.[23] The various
attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of
shale-oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or
its other substitutes. According to a survey conducted by the RAND_Corporation,
the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the
United States (comprising a mine, retorting_plant, upgrading_plant, supporting
utilities, and spent shale reclamation), would range between US$70â95
($440â600/m3, adjusted to 2005 values). This estimate considers varying
levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency. In order to run a
profitable operation, the price of crude oil would need to remain above these
levels. The analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would
drop after the establishment of the complex. The hypothetical unit would see a
cost reduction of 35â70% after producing its first 500 million barrels
(79 million cubic metres). Assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand
barrels per day (4.0Ã10^3 m3/d) during each year after the start of commercial
production, RAND predicts the costs would decline to $35â48 per barrel
($220â300/m3) within 12 years. After achieving the milestone of 1 billion
barrels (160 million cubic metres), its costs would decline further to $30â40
per barrel ($190â250/m3).[44][53] Some commentators compare the proposed
American oil-shale industry to the Athabasca_oil-sands industry (the latter
enterprise generated over 1 million barrels (160,000 cubic metres) of oil per
day in late 2007), stating that "the first-generation facility is the hardest,
both technically and economically".[66][67]
In 2005, Royal_Dutch_Shell announced that its_in-situ_process could become
competitive for oil prices over $30 per barrel ($190/m3).[68] A 2004 report by
the United_States_Department_of_Energy stated that both the Shell technology
and technology used in the Stuart_Oil_Shale_Project could be competitive at
prices above $25 per barrel, and that the Viru_Keemia_Grupp expected full-scale
production to be economical at prices above $18 per barrel ($130/m3).[56][69]
To increase efficiency when retorting oil shale, researchers have proposed and
tested several co-pyrolysis processes.[70][71][72][73][74]
A 1972 publication in the journal PÃ©trole Informations (
ISSN 0755-561X) compared shale-based oil production unfavorably with coal
liquefaction. The article portrayed coal liquefaction as less expensive,
generating more oil, and creating fewer environmental impacts than extraction
from oil shale. It cited a conversion ratio of 650 liters (170 U.S. gal;
140 imp gal) of oil per one ton of coal, as against 150 liters (40 U.S. gal;
33 imp gal) of shale oil per one ton of oil shale.[35]
A critical measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in
the ratio of the energy produced by the shale to the energy used in its mining
and processing, a ratio known as "Energy Returned on Energy Invested" (EROEI).
A 1984 study estimated the EROEI of the various known oil-shale deposits as
varying between 0.7â13.3[75] although known oil-shale extraction development
projects assert an EROEI between 3 and 10. According to the World Energy
Outlook 2010, the EROEI of ex-situ processing is typically 4 to 5 while of in-
situ processing it may be even as low as 2. However, according to the IEA most
of used energy can be provided by burning the spent shale or oil-shale gas.[76]
The water needed in the oil shale retorting process offers an additional
economic consideration: this may pose a problem in areas with water scarcity.
***** Environmental considerations[edit] *****
Main article: Environmental_impact_of_the_oil_shale_industry
Mining oil shale involves a number of environmental impacts, more pronounced in
surface mining than in underground mining.[77] These include acid drainage
induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly
buried materials, the introduction of metals including mercury[78] into
surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air
pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing,
transport, and support activities.[6][7] In 2002, about 97% of air pollution,
86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power
industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.
[79]
Oil-shale extraction can damage the biological and recreational value of land
and the ecosystem in the mining area. Combustion and thermal processing
generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale
processing and combustion include carbon_dioxide, a greenhouse_gas.
Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even
more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels.[80] Experimental in situ
conversion processes and carbon_capture_and_storage technologies may reduce
some of these concerns in the future, but at the same time they may cause other
problems, including groundwater_pollution.[81] Among the water contaminants
commonly associated with oil shale processing are oxygen and nitrogen
heterocyclic hydrocarbons. Commonly detected examples include quinoline
derivatives, pyridine, and various alkyl homologues of pyridine (picoline,
lutidine).[82]
Water concerns are sensitive issues in arid regions, such as the western US and
Israel's Negev_Desert, where plans exist to expand oil-shale extraction despite
a water shortage.[83] Depending on technology, above-ground retorting uses
between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil.[53][84]
[85][86] A 2008 programmatic environmental_impact_statement issued by the US
Bureau_of_Land_Management stated that surface mining and retort operations
produce 2 to 10 U.S. gallons (7.6 to 37.9 l; 1.7 to 8.3 imp gal) of waste water
per 1 short ton (0.91 t) of processed oil shale.[84] In situ processing,
according to one estimate, uses about one-tenth as much water.[87]
Environmental activists, including members of Greenpeace, have organized strong
protests against the oil shale industry. In one result, Queensland_Energy
Resources put the proposed Stuart_Oil_Shale_Project in Australia on hold in
2004.[6][88][89]
***** Extraterrestrial oil shale[edit] *****
Some comets contain "massive amounts of an organic material almost identical to
high grade oil shale," the equivalent of cubic kilometers of such mixed with
other material;[90] for instance, corresponding hydrocarbons were detected in a
probe fly-by through the tail of Comet Halley during 1986.[91]
