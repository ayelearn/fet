Oil_shale_gas.
48 structural_basins with shale gas and oil, in 38 countries, per the US Energy
Information_Administration, 2011.
As of 2013, the US, Canada, and China are the only countries producing shale
gas in commercial quantities. The US and Canada are the only countries where
shale gas is a significant part of the gas supply.
Total natural gas rig count in the US (including conventional gas drilling)
Shale gas is natural_gas that is found trapped within shale formations.[1]
Shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas in the
United States since the start of this century, and interest has spread to
potential gas shales in the rest of the world. In 2000 shale gas provided only
1% of U.S. natural gas production; by 2010 it was over 20% and the U.S.
government's Energy_Information_Administration predicts that by 2035, 46% of
the United States' natural gas supply will come from shale gas.[2]
Some analysts expect that shale gas will greatly expand worldwide_energy
supply.[3] China is estimated to have the world's largest shale gas reserves.
[4]
The Obama_administration believed that increased shale gas development would
help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[5] In 2012, US carbon dioxide emissions
dropped to a 20-year low.[6]
A 2013 review by the United Kingdom Department_of_Energy_and_Climate_Change
noted that most studies of the subject have estimated that life-cycle
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shale gas are similar to those of
conventional natural gas, and are much less than those from coal, usually about
half the greenhouse gas emissions of coal; the noted exception was a 2011 study
by Howarth and others of Cornell_University, which concluded that shale GHG
emissions were as high as those of coal.[7][8] More recent studies have also
concluded that life-cycle shale gas GHG emissions are much less than those of
coal,[9][10][11][12] among them, studies by Natural_Resources_Canada (2012),
[13] and a consortium formed by the US National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory
with a number of universities (2012).[14]
Some 2011 studies pointed to high rates of decline of some shale gas wells as
an indication that shale gas production may ultimately be much lower than is
currently projected.[15][16] But shale-gas discoveries are also opening up
substantial new resources of tight_oil / "shale oil".[17]

***** History[edit] *****
**** US[edit] ****
Derrick and platform of drilling gas wells in Marcellus Shale â Pennsylvania
Shale gas was first extracted as a resource in Fredonia,_New_York, in 1821,[18]
[19] in shallow, low-pressure fractures. Horizontal drilling began in the
1930s, and in 1947 a well was first fracked in the U.S.[2]
Federal price controls on natural gas led to shortages in the 1970s.[20] Faced
with declining natural gas production, the federal government invested in many
supply alternatives, including the Eastern Gas Shales Project, which lasted
from 1976 to 1992, and the annual FERC-approved research budget of the Gas
Research Institute, where the federal government began extensive research
funding in 1982, disseminating the results to industry.[2] The federal
government also provided tax credits and rules benefiting the industry in the
1980_Energy_Act.[2] The Department of Energy later partnered with private gas
companies to complete the first successful air-drilled multi-fracture
horizontal well in shale in 1986. The federal government further incentivized
drilling in shale via the Section 29 tax credit for unconventional gas from
1980â2000. Microseismic imaging, a crucial input to both hydraulic_fracturing
in shale and offshore_oil_drilling, originated from coalbeds research at Sandia
National_Laboratories. The DOE program also applied two technologies that had
been developed previously by industry, massive hydraulic fracturing and
horizontal drilling, to shale gas formations,[21] which led to microseismic
imaging.
Although the Eastern Gas Shales Project had increased gas production in the
Appalachian and Michigan basins, shale gas was still widely seen as marginal to
uneconomic without tax credits, and shale gas provided only 1.6% of US gas
production in 2000, when the federal tax credits expired.[20]
George_P._Mitchell is regarded as the father of the shale gas industry, since
he made it commercially viable in the Barnett_Shale by getting costs down to $4
per 1 million British_thermal_units (1,100 megajoules).[22] Mitchell Energy
achieved the first economical shale fracture in 1998 using slick-water
fracturing.[23][24][25] Since then, natural gas from shale has been the fastest
growing contributor to total primary energy in the United States, and has led
many other countries to pursue shale deposits. According to the IEA, shale gas
could increase technically recoverable natural gas resources by almost 50%.[26]
***** Geology[edit] *****
An illustration of shale gas compared to other types of gas deposits.
Because shales ordinarily have insufficient permeability to allow significant
fluid flow to a wellbore, most shales are not commercial sources of natural
gas. Shale gas is one of a number of unconventional sources of natural gas;
others include coalbed_methane, tight_sandstones, and methane_hydrates. Shale
gas areas are often known as resource plays[27] (as opposed to exploration
plays). The geological risk of not finding gas is low in resource plays, but
the potential profits per successful well are usually also lower.[citation
needed]
Shale has low matrix permeability, and so gas production in commercial
quantities requires fractures to provide permeability. Shale gas has been
produced for years from shales with natural fractures; the shale gas boom in
recent years has been due to modern technology in hydraulic_fracturing
(fracking) to create extensive artificial fractures around well bores.[citation
needed]
Horizontal_drilling is often used with shale gas wells, with lateral lengths up
to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) within the shale, to create maximum borehole surface
area in contact with the shale.[citation_needed]
Shales that host economic quantities of gas have a number of common properties.
They are rich in organic material (0.5% to 25%),[28] and are usually mature
petroleum source_rocks in the thermogenic gas window, where high heat and
pressure have converted petroleum to natural gas. They are sufficiently brittle
and rigid enough to maintain open fractures.
Some of the gas produced is held in natural fractures, some in pore spaces, and
some is adsorbed onto the organic material. The gas in the fractures is
produced immediately; the gas adsorbed onto organic material is released as the
formation pressure is drawn down by the well.[citation_needed]
***** Shale gas by country[edit] *****
Main articles: Shale_gas_by_country and List_of_countries_by_recoverable_shale
gas
Although the shale gas potential of many nations is being studied, as of 2013,
only the US, Canada, and China produce shale gas in commercial quantities, and
only the US and Canada have significant shale gas production.[29] While China
has ambitious plans to dramatically increase its shale gas production, these
efforts have been checked by inadequate access to technology, water, and land.
[30][31]

Administration agency of the United_States_Department_of_Energy.[32] Numbers

The US EIA had made an earlier estimate of total recoverable shale gas in
various countries in 2011, which for some countries differed significantly from
the 2013 estimates.[34] The total recoverable shale gas in the United States,
which was estimated at 862 trillion cubic feet in 2011, was revised downward to
665 trillion cubic feet in 2013. Recoverable shale gas in Canada, which was
estimated to be 388 TCF in 2011, was revised upward to 573 TCF in 2013.
For the United States, EIA estimated (2013) a total "wet natural gas" resource
of 2,431 tcf, including both shale and conventional gas. Shale gas was
estimated to be 27% of the total resource.[32] "Wet natural gas" is methane
plus natural_gas_liquids, and is more valuable than dry gas.[35][36]
For the rest of the world (excluding US), EIA estimated (2013) a total wet
natural_gas resource of 20,451 trillion cubic feet (579.1Ã10^12 m3). Shale gas
was estimated to be 32% of the total resource.[32]
Europe has estimated shale gas reserves of 639 trillion cubic feet
(18.1Ã10^12 m3) compared with America's 862 trillion cubic feet
(24.4Ã10^12 m3), but its geology is more complicated and the oil and gas more
expensive to extract, with a well likely to cost as much as three-and-a-half
times more than one in the United States.[37] Europe would be the fastest
growing region, accounting for the highest CAGR of 59.5%, in terms of volume
owing to availability of shale gas reserves in more than 14 European countries.
[38]
***** Environment[edit] *****
See also: Natural_gas and Environmental_impact_of_hydraulic_fracturing
The extraction and use of shale gas can affect the environment through the
leaking of extraction chemicals and waste into water supplies, the leaking of
greenhouse_gases during extraction, and the pollution caused by the improper
processing of natural gas. A challenge to preventing pollution is that shale
gas extractions varies widely in this regard, even between different wells in
the same project; the processes that reduce pollution sufficiently in one
extraction may not be enough in another.[2]
In 2013 the European_Parliament agreed that environmental_impact_assessments
will not be mandatory for shale gas exploration activities and shale gas
extraction activities will be subject to the same terms as other gas extraction
projects.[39]
**** Climate[edit] ****
Barack Obama's administration has sometimes promoted shale gas, in part because
of its belief that it releases fewer greenhouse_gas (GHG) emissions than other
fossil fuels. In a 2010 letter to President Obama, Martin_Apple of the Council
of_Scientific_Society_Presidents cautioned against a national policy of
developing shale gas without a more certain scientific basis for the policy.
This umbrella organization that represents 1.4 million scientists noted that
shale gas development "may have greater GHG emissions and environmental costs
than previously appreciated."[40]
In late 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency[41] issued a new report,
the first update on emission factors for greenhouse gas emissions by the oil
and gas industry by the EPA since 1996. In this new report, the EPA concluded
that shale gas emits larger amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse_gas, than
does conventional gas, but still far less than coal. Methane is a powerful
greenhouse gas, although it stays in the atmosphere for only one tenth as long
a period as carbon dioxide. Recent evidence suggests that methane has a global
warming_potential (GWP) that is 105-fold greater than carbon dioxide when
viewed over a 20-year period and 33-fold greater when viewed over a 100-year
period, compared mass-to-mass.[42]
Several studies which have estimated lifecycle methane leakage from shale gas
development and production have found a wide range of leakage rates, from less
than 1% of total production to nearly 8%.[43] Using data from the Environmental
Protection Agency's most recent Greenhouse Gas Inventory[44] yields a methane
leakage rate of about 1.4%, down from 2.3% from the EPA's previous Inventory.
[45]
The most comprehensive study of methane leakage from shale gas to date,
initiated by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and released in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on 16 September 2013,[46] finds
that fugitive emissions in key stages of the natural gas production process are
significantly lower than estimates in the EPA's national emissions inventory
(which are already quite low). The study reports direct measurements from 190
onshore natural gas sites across the country and estimates a leakage rate of
0.42% for gas production. Although the EDF study did not cover all stages of
natural gas supply chain, subsequent studies are planned to estimate leakage
rates in others parts of the system.
A 2011 study published in Climatic_Change_Letters controversially claimed that
the production of electricity using shale gas may lead to as much or more life-
cycle GWP than electricity generated with oil or coal.[47] In that peer-
reviewed paper, Cornell_University professor Robert W. Howarth, a marine
ecologist, and colleagues claimed that once methane leak and venting impacts
are included, the life-cycle greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas is far worse
than those of coal and fuel oil when viewed for the integrated 20-year period
after emission. On the 100-year integrated time frame, this analysis claims
shale gas is comparable to coal and worse than fuel oil. However, numerous
studies have pointed out critical flaws with that paper and/or come to
completely different conclusions, including assessments by experts at the U.S.
Department of Energy,[48] peer-reviewed studies by Carnegie Mellon University
[49] and the University of Maryland,[50] and even the Natural_Resources_Defense
Council, which concluded that the Howarth et al. paper's use of a 20-year time
horizon for global warming potential of methane is "too short a period to be
appropriate for policy analysis."[51]
In January 2012, Howarth's own colleagues at Cornell University, Lawrence
Cathles et al., responded with their own peer-reviewed assessment, noting that
the Howarth paper was "seriously flawed" because it "significantly overestimate
[s] the fugitive emissions associated with unconventional gas extraction,
undervalue[s] the contribution of 'green technologies' to reducing those
emissions to a level approaching that of conventional gas, base[s] their
comparison between gas and coal on heat rather than electricity generation
(almost the sole use of coal), and assume[s] a time interval over which to
compute the relative climate impact of gas compared to coal that does not
capture the contrast between the long residence time of CO2 and the short
residence time of methane in the atmosphere." The author of that response,
Lawrence Cathles, concludes that "shale gas has a GHG footprint that is half
and perhaps a third that of coal," based upon "more reasonable leakage rates
and bases of comparison."[52]
In April 2013 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency dramatically lowered its
estimate of how much methane leaks from wells, pipelines and other facilities
during production and delivery of natural gas by 20 percent. According to the
Associated Press, the EPA report on greenhouse emissions credited tighter
pollution controls instituted by the industry for cutting an average of 41.6
million metric tons of methane_emissions annually from 1990 through 2010, a
reduction of more than 850 million metric tons overall. The AP noted, "The EPA
revisions came even though natural gas production has grown by nearly 40
percent since 1990." [53]
**** Life cycle comparison for more than global warming potential[edit] ****
A 2014 study from Manchester University presented the "First full life cycle
assessment of shale gas used for electricity generation." By full life cycle
assessment, the authors explained that they mean the evaluation of nine
environmental factors beyond the commonly performed evaluation of global
warming potential. The authors concluded that, in line with most of the
published studies for other regions, that shale gas in the United Kingdom would
have a global warming potential "broadly similar" to that of conventional North
Sea gas, although shale gas has the potential to be higher if fugitive methane
emissions are not controlled, or if per-well ultimate recoveries in the UK are
small. For the other parameters, the highlighted conclusions were that, for
shale gas in the United Kingdom in comparison with coal, conventional and
liquefied gas, nuclear, wind and solar (PV).
    * Shale gas worse than coal for three impacts and better than renewables
      for four.
    * It has higher photochemical smog and terrestrial toxicity than the other
      options.
    * Shale gas a sound environmental option only if accompanied by stringent
      regulation.[54][55]
Dr James Verdon has published a critique of the data produced, and the
variables that may affect the results.[56]
**** Water and air quality[edit] ****
Chemicals are added to the water to facilitate the underground fracturing
process that releases natural gas. Fracturing fluid is primarily water and
approximately 0.5% chemical additives (friction reducer, agents countering
rust, agents killing microorganism). Since (depending on the size of the area)
millions of liters of water are used, this means that hundreds of thousands
liters of chemicals are often injected into the subsurface.[57] About 50% to
70% of the injected volume of contaminated water is recovered and stored in
above-ground ponds to await removal by tanker. The remaining volume remains in
the subsurface. Hydraulic fracturing opponents fear that it can lead to
contamination of groundwater_aquifers, though the industry deems this "highly
unlikely". However, foul-smelling odors and heavy_metals contaminating the
local water supply above-ground have been reported.[58]
Besides using water and industrial chemicals, it is also possible to frack
shale gas with only liquified propane gas. This reduces the environmental
degradation considerably. The method was invented by GasFrac, of Alberta,
Canada.[59]
Hydraulic fracturing was exempted from the Safe Drinking Water Act in the
Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005.[60]
A study published in May 2011 concluded that shale gas wells have seriously
contaminated shallow groundwater supplies in northeastern_Pennsylvania with
flammable methane. However, the study does not discuss how pervasive such
contamination might be in other areas drilled for shale gas.[61]
The United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency (EPA) announced 23 June 2011
that it will examine claims of water pollution related to hydraulic fracturing
in Texas, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Louisiana.[62] On 8 December
2011, the EPA issued a draft finding which stated that groundwater
contamination in Pavillion,_Wyoming may be the result of fracking in the area.
The EPA stated that the finding was specific to the Pavillion area, where the
fracking techniques differ from those used in other parts of the U.S. Doug
Hock, a spokesman for the company which owns the Pavillion gas field, said that
it is unclear whether the contamination came from the fracking process.[63]
Wyoming's Governor Matt Mead called the EPA draft report "scientifically
questionable" and stressed the need for additional testing.[64] The Casper
Star-Tribune also reported on 27 December 2011, that the EPA's sampling and
testing procedures "didnât follow their own protocol" according to Mike
Purcell, the director of the Wyoming Water Development Commission.[65]
A 2011 study by the Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology concluded that "The
environmental impacts of shale development are challenging but manageable." The
study addressed groundwater contamination, noting "There has been concern that
these fractures can also penetrate shallow freshwater zones and contaminate
them with fracturing ï¬uid, but there is no evidence that this is occurring".
This study blames known instances of methane contamination on a small number of
sub-standard operations, and encourages the use of industry best practices to
prevent such events from recurring.[66]
In a report dated 25 July 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
announced that it had completed its testing of private drinking water wells in
Dimock, Pennsylvania. Data previously supplied to the agency by residents, the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and Cabot Oil and Gas
Exploration had indicated levels of arsenic, barium or manganese in well water
at five homes at levels that could present a health concern. In response, water
treatment systems that can reduce concentrations of those hazardous substances
to acceptable levels at the tap were installed at affected homes. Based on the
outcome of sampling after the treatment systems were installed, the EPA
concluded that additional action by the Agency was not required.[67]
A Duke_University study of Blacklick_Creek_(Pennsylvania), carried out over two
years, took samples from the creek upstream and down stream of the discharge
point of Josephine Brine Treatment Facility. Radium levels in the sediment at
the discharge point are around 200 times the amount upstream of the facility.
The radium levels are "above regulated levels" and present the "danger of slow
bio-accumulation" eventually in fish. The Duke study "is the first to use
isotope hydrology to connect the dots between shale gas waste, treatment sites
and discharge into drinking water supplies." The study recommended "independent
monitoring and regulation" in the United States due to perceived deficiencies
in self-regulation.[68][69]
     What is happening is the direct result of a lack of any regulation.
     If the Clean Water Act was applied in 2005 when the shale gas boom
     started this would have been prevented. In the UK, if shale gas is
     going to develop, it should not follow the American example and
     should impose environmental regulation to prevent this kind of
     radioactive buildup.
     â Avner Vengosh[68]
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Water Act
applies to surface stream discharges from shale gas wells:
      "6) Does the Clean Water Act apply to discharges from Marcellus Shale
      Drilling operations?
      Yes. Natural gas drilling can result in discharges to surface waters. The
      discharge of this water is subject to requirements under the Clean Water
      Act (CWA)."[70]
**** Earthquakes[edit] ****
Hydraulic fracturing routinely produces microseismic events much too small to
be detected except by sensitive instruments. These microseismic events are
often used to map the horizontal and vertical extent of the fracturing.[71]
However, as of late 2012, there have been three known instances worldwide of
hydraulic fracturing, through induced_seismicity, triggering quakes large
enough to be felt by people.[72]
On 26 April 2012, the Asahi_Shimbun reported that United_States_Geological
Survey scientists have been investigating the recent increase in the number of
magnitude 3 and greater earthquake in the midcontinent of the United_States.
Beginning in 2001, the average number of earthquakes occurring per year of
magnitude 3 or greater increased significantly, culminating in a six-fold
increase in 2011 over 20th century levels. A researcher in Center for
Earthquake Research and Information of University_of_Memphis assumes water
pushed back into the fault tends to cause earthquake by slippage of fault.[73]
[74]
Over 109 small earthquakes (Mw 0.4â3.9) were detected during January 2011 to
February 2012 in the Youngstown, Ohio area, where there were no known
earthquakes in the past. These shocks were close to a deep ï¬uid injection
well. The 14 month seismicity included six felt earthquakes and culminated with
a Mw 3.9 shock on 31 December 2011. Among the 109 shocks, 12 events greater
than Mw 1.8 were detected by regional network and accurately relocated, whereas
97 small earthquakes (0.4<Mw<1.8) were detected by the waveform correlation
detector. Accurately located earthquakes were along a subsurface fault trending
ENE-WSWâconsistent with the focal mechanism of the main shock and occurred at
depths 3.5â4.0 km in the Precambrian basement.
On 19 June 2012, the United States Senate Committee on Energy & Natural
Resources held a hearing entitled, "Induced Seismicity Potential in Energy
Technologies." Dr. Murray Hitzman, the Charles F. Fogarty Professor of Economic
Geology in the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering at the Colorado
School of Mines in Golden, CO testified that "About 35,000 hydraulically
fractured shale gas wells exist in the United States. Only one case of felt
seismicity in the United States has been described in which hydraulic
fracturing for shale gas development is suspected, but not confirmed. Globally
only one case of felt induced seismicity at Blackpool, England has been
confirmed as being caused by hydraulic fracturing for shale gas development."
[75]
**** The relative impacts of natural gas and coal[edit] ****
*** Human health impacts[edit] ***
A comprehensive review of the public health effects of energy fuel cycles in
Europe finds that coal causes 6 to 98 deaths per TWh (average 25 deaths per
TWh), compared to natural gasâ 1 to 11 deaths per TWh (average 3 deaths per
TWh). These numbers include both accidental deaths and pollution-related
deaths.[76] Coal mining is one of the most dangerous professions in the United
States, resulting in between 20 and 40 deaths annually, compared to between 10
and 20 for oil and gas extraction.[77] Worker accident risk is also far higher
with coal than gas. In the United States, the oil and gas extraction industry
is associated with one to two injuries per 100 workers each year. Coal mining,
on the other hand, contributes to four injuries per 100 workers each year. Coal
mines collapse, and can take down roads, water and gas lines, buildings and
many lives with them.[78]
Average damages from coal pollutants are two orders of magnitude larger than
damages from natural gas. SO2, NOx, and particulate_matter from coal plants
create annual damages of $156 million per plant compared to $1.5 million per
gas plant.[79] Coal-fired power plants in the United States emit 17â40 times
more SOx emissions per MWh than natural gas, and 1â17 times as much NOx per
MWh.[80] Lifecycle CO2 emissions from coal plants are 1.8-2.3 times greater
(per KWh) than natural gas emissions.[81]
The air quality advantages of natural gas over coal have been borne out in
Pennsylvania, according to studies by the RAND_Corporation and the Pennsylvania
Department_of_Environmental_Protection. The shale boom in Pennsylvania has led
to dramatically lower emissions of sulfur dioxide, fine particulates, and
volatile_organic_compounds (VOCs).[11]
Physicist Richard_A._Muller has said that the public_health benefits from shale
gas, by displacing harmful air pollution from coal, far outweigh its
environmental costs. In a 2013 report for the Centre_for_Policy_Studies, Muller
wrote that air pollution, mostly from coal burning, kills over three million
people each year, primarily in the developing world. The report states that
"Environmentalists who oppose the development of shale gas and fracking are
making a tragic mistake." [12] In China, shale gas development is seen[when?]
as a way to shift away from coal and decrease serious air pollution problems
created by burning coal.[82]
*** Social Impacts[edit] ***
Shale gas development leads to a series of tiered socio-economic effects during
boom conditions.[83] These include both positive and negative aspects. Along
with other forms of unconventional energy, shale oil and gas extraction has
three direct initial aspects: increased labour demand (employment);[84] income
generation (higher wages);[85] and disturbance to land and/or other economic
activity, potentially resulting in compensation. Following these primary direct
effects, the following secondary effects occur: in-migration (to meet labour
demand), attracting temporary and/or permanent residents, Increased demand for
goods and services; leading to increased indirect employment.[86] The latter
two of these can fuel each other in a circular relationship during boom
conditions (i.e. increased demand for goods and services creates employment
which increase demand for goods and services). These increases place strain on
existing infrastructure. These conditions lead to tertiary socio-economic
effects in the form of increased housing values; increased rental costs;
construction of new dwellings (which may take time to be completed);
demographic and cultural changes as new types of people move to the host
region;[87] changes to income distribution; potential for conflict; potential
for increased substance abuse; and provision of new types of services.[83] The
reverse of these effects occurs over bust conditions, with a decline in primary
effects leading to a decline in secondary effects and so on. However, the bust
period of unconventional extraction may not be as severe as from conventional
energy extraction.[88] Due to the dispersed nature of the industry and ability
to adjust drilling rates, there is debate in the literature as to how intense
the bust phase is and how host communities can maintain social resilience
during downturns.[89]
*** Landscape impacts[edit] ***
Coal mining radically alters whole mountain and forest landscapes. Beyond the
coal removed from the earth, large areas of forest are turned inside out and
blackened with toxic and radioactive chemicals. There have been reclamation
successes, but hundreds of thousands of acres of abandoned surface mines in the
United States have not been reclaimed, and reclamation of certain terrain
(including steep terrain) is nearly impossible.[90]
Where coal exploration requires altering landscapes far beyond the area where
the coal is, aboveground natural gas equipment takes up just one percent of the
total surface land area from where gas will be extracted.[91] The environmental
impact of gas drilling has changed radically in recent years. Vertical wells
into conventional formations used to take up one-fifth of the surface area
above the resource, a twenty-fold higher impact than current horizontal
drilling requires. A six-acre horizontal drill pad can thus extract gas from an
underground area 1,000 acres in size.
The impact of natural gas on landscapes is even less and shorter in duration
than the impact of wind turbines. The footprint of a shale gas derrick (3â5
acres) is only a little larger than the land area necessary for a single wind
turbine.[92] But it requires less concrete, stands one-third as tall, and is
present for just 30 days instead of 20â30 years. Between 7 and 15 weeks are
spent setting up the drill pad and completing the actual hydraulic fracture. At
that point, the drill pad is removed, leaving behind a single garage-sized
wellhead that remains for the lifetime of the well.[citation_needed] A study
published in 2015 on the Fayetteville Shale found that a mature gas field
impacted about 2% of the land area and substantially increased edge habitat
creation. Average land impact per well was 3 hectares (about 7 acres) [93]
*** Water[edit] ***
With coal mining, waste materials are piled at the surface of the mine,
creating aboveground runoff that pollutes and alters the flow of regional
streams. As rain percolates through waste piles, soluble components are
dissolved in the runoff and cause elevated total dissolved solids (TDS) levels
in local water bodies.[90] Sulfates, calcium, carbonates and bicarbonates â
the typical runoff products of coalmine waste materials â make water unusable
for industry or agriculture and undrinkable for humans.[94] Acid mine
wastewater can drain into groundwater, causing significant contamination.
Explosive blasting in a mine can cause groundwater to seep to lower-than-normal
depths or connect two aquifers that were previously distinct, exposing both to
contamination by mercury, lead, and other toxic heavy metals.
Contamination of surface waterways and groundwater with fracking fluids can be
problematic.[95] Shale gas deposits are generally several thousand feet below
ground. There have been instances of methane migration, improper treatment of
recovered wastewater, and pollution via reinjection wells.[citation_needed]
In most cases, the life-cycle water intensity and pollution associated with
coal production and combustion far outweigh those related to shale gas
production. Coal resource production requires at least twice as much water per
million British thermal units (mmBTU) compared to shale gas production.[96] And
while regions like Pennsylvania have experienced an absolute increase in water
demand for energy production thanks to the shale boom, shale wells actually
produce less than half the wastewater per unit of energy compared to
conventional natural gas.[91]
Coal-fired power plants consume two to five times as much water as natural gas
plants. Where 520â1040 gallons of water are required per MWh of coal, gas-
fired combined cycle power requires 130â500 gallons per MWh.[97] The
environmental impact of water consumption at the point of power generation
depends on the type of power plant: plants either use evaporative cooling
towers to release excess heat or discharge water to nearby rivers.[98] Natural
gas combined-cycle power (NGCC), which captures the exhaust heat generated by
combusting natural gas to power a steam generator, are considered the most
efficient large-scale thermal power plants. One study found that the life-cycle
demand for water from coal power in Texas could be more than halved by
switching the fleet to NGCC.[99]
All told, shale gas development in the United States represents less than half
a percent of total domestic freshwater consumption, although this portion can
reach as high as 25 percent in particularly arid regions.[100]
***** Hazards[edit] *****
Drilling depths of 1,000 to 3,000 m, then injection of a fluid composed of
water, sand and detergents under pressure (600 bar), are required to fracture
the rock and release the gas. These operations have already caused groundwater
contaminations across the Atlantic, mainly as a result of hydrocarbon leakage
along the casings.[citation_needed] In addition, between 2% and 8% of the
extracted fuel would be released to the atmosphere at wells (still in the
United States).[citation_needed] However, it is mainly composed of methane
(CH4), a greenhouse gas that is considerably more powerful than CO2.
Surface installations must be based on concrete or paved soils connected to the
road network. A gas pipeline is also required to evacuate production. In total,
each farm would occupy an average area of 3.6 ha. However, the gas fields are
relatively small. Exploitation of shale gas could therefore lead to
fragmentation of landscapes. Finally, a borehole requires about 20 million
liters of water, the daily consumption of about 100,000 inhabitants.[101]
***** Economics[edit] *****
See also: Natural_gas_prices
Although shale gas has been produced for more than 100 years in the Appalachian
Basin and the Illinois_Basin of the United States, the wells were often
marginally economic. Advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
completions have made shale-gas wells more profitable.[102] Improvements in
moving drilling rigs between nearby locations, and the use of single well pads
for multiple wells have increased the productivity of drilling shale gas wells.
[103] As of June 2011, the validity of the claims of economic viability of
these wells has begun to be publicly questioned.[104] Shale gas tends to cost
more to produce than gas from conventional wells, because of the expense of the
massive hydraulic_fracturing treatments required to produce shale gas, and of
horizontal drilling.[105]
The cost of extracting offshore shale gas in the UK were estimated to be more
than $200 per barrel of oil equivalent (UK North Sea oil prices were about $120
per barrel in April 2012). However, no cost figures were made public for
onshore shale gas.[106]
North America has been the leader in developing and producing shale gas. The
economic success of the Barnett_Shale play in Texas in particular has spurred
the search for other sources of shale gas across the United_States and Canada,
[citation_needed]
Some Texas residents think fracking is using too much of their groundwater, but
drought and other growing uses are also part of the causes of the water
shortage there.[107]
A Visiongain research report calculated the 2011 worth of the global shale-gas
market as $26.66 billion.[108]
A 2011 New_York_Times investigation of industrial emails and internal documents
found that the financial benefits of unconventional shale gas extraction may be
less than previously thought, due to companies intentionally overstating the
productivity of their wells and the size of their reserves.[109] The article
was criticized by, among others, the New York Times' own Public Editor for lack
of balance in omitting facts and viewpoints favorable to shale gas production
and economics.[110]
In first quarter 2012, the United States imported 840 billion_cubic_feet (Bcf)
(785 from Canada) while exporting 400 Bcf (mostly to Canada); both mainly by
pipeline.[111] Almost none is exported by ship as LNG, as that would require
expensive facilities. In 2012, prices went down to $3/MMBtu due to shale gas.
[112]
A recent academic paper on the economic impacts of shale gas development in the
US finds that natural gas prices have dropped dramatically in places with shale
deposits with active exploration. Natural gas for industrial use has become
cheaper by around 30% compared to the rest of the US.[113] This stimulates
local energy intensive manufacturing growth, but brings the lack of adequate
pipeline capacity in the US in sharp relief.[114]
One of the byproducts of shale gas exploration is the opening up of deep
underground shale deposits to "tight oil" or shale oil production. By 2035,
shale oil production could "boost the world economy by up to $2.7 trillion, a
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report says. It has the potential to reach up to
12 percent of the worldâs total oil production â touching 14 million
barrels a day â ârevolutionizingâ the global energy markets over the next
few decades." [17]
According to a 2013 Forbes_magazine article, generating electricity by burning
natural gas is cheaper than burning coal if the price of gas remains below $3/
mmBTU ($3/mcf).[22] Also in 2013, Ken Medlock, Senior Director of the Baker
Institute's Center for Energy Studies, researched US shale gas break-even
prices. "Some wells are profitable at $2.65 per thousand cubic feet, others
need $8.10â¦the median is $4.85," Medlock said.[115] Energy consultant Euan
Mearns estimates that, for the US, "minimum costs [are] in the range $4 to $6 /
mcf. [or mm BTU]." [116][117]
