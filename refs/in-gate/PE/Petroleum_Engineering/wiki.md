Example of a map used by reservoir engineers to determine where to drill a
well. This screenshot is of a structure map generated by contour map software
for an 8500 ft deep gas and oil_reservoir in the Earth field, Vermilion_Parish,
Erath, Louisiana. The left-to-right gap near the top of the contour_map
indicates a fault_line. This fault line is between the blue/green contour lines
and the purple/red/yellow contour lines. The thin red circular contour line in
the middle of the map indicates the top of the oil reservoir. Because gas
floats above oil, the thin red contour line marks the gas/oil contact zone.
Petroleum engineering is a field of engineering concerned with the activities
related to the production of hydrocarbons, which can be either crude_oil or
natural_gas.[1] Exploration and production are deemed to fall within the
upstream sector of the oil and gas industry. Exploration, by earth_scientists,
and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry's two main subsurface
disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery of hydrocarbons from
subsurface reservoirs. Petroleum_geology and geophysics focus on provision of a
static description of the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, while petroleum
engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource
using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas
within porous rock at very high pressure.
The combined efforts of geologists and petroleum engineers throughout the life
of a hydrocarbon accumulation determine the way in which a reservoir is
developed and depleted, and usually they have the highest impact on field
economics. Petroleum engineering requires a good knowledge of many other
related disciplines, such as geophysics, petroleum geology, formation
evaluation (well_logging), drilling, economics, reservoir_simulation, reservoir
engineering, well engineering, artificial_lift systems, completions and
petroleum_production_engineering.
Recruitment to the industry has historically been from the disciplines of
physics, chemical_engineering and mining_engineering. Subsequent development
training has usually been done within oil companies.

***** Overview[edit] *****
The profession got its start in 1914 within the American_Institute_of_Mining,
Metallurgical_and_Petroleum_Engineers (AIME). The first Petroleum Engineering
degree was conferred in 1915 by the University_of_Pittsburgh.[2] Since then,
the profession has evolved to solve increasingly difficult situations.
Improvements in computer modeling, materials and the application of statistics,
probability analysis, and new technologies like horizontal_drilling and
enhanced_oil_recovery, have drastically improved the toolbox of the petroleum
engineer in recent decades. Automation,[3] sensors,[4] and robots[5][6] are
being used to propel the industry to more efficiency and safety.
Deep-water, arctic and desert conditions are usually contended with. High
temperature and high pressure (HTHP) environments have become increasingly
commonplace in operations and require the petroleum engineer to be savvy in
topics as wide-ranging as thermo-hydraulics, geomechanics, and intelligent
systems.
The Society_of_Petroleum_Engineers (SPE) is the largest professional_society
for petroleum engineers and publishes much technical information and other
resources to support the oil and gas industry. It provides free online
education (webinars), mentoring, and access to SPE Connect, an exclusive
platform for members to discuss technical issues, best practices, and other
topics. SPE members also are able to access the SPE Competency Management Tool
to find knowledge and skill strengths and opportunities for growth.[7] SPE
publishes peer-reviewed journals, books, and magazines.[8] SPE members receive
a complimentary subscription to the Journal of Petroleum Technology and
discounts on SPE's other publications.[9] SPE members also receive discounts on
registration fees for SPE organized events and training courses.[9] SPE
provides scholarships and fellowships to undergraduate and graduate students.
According to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statics,
petroleum engineers are required to have a bachelor's degree in engineering,
generally a degree focused on petroleum engineering is preferred, but degrees
in mechanical, chemical, and civil engineering are satisfactory as well.[10]
Petroleum engineering education is available at many universities in the United
States and throughout the world - primarily in oil producing regions. U.S. News
& World Report maintains a list of the Best Underdegraduate Petroleum
Engineering Programs.[11] SPE and some private companies offer training
courses.[12][13][14] Some oil companies have considerable in-house petroleum
engineering training classes.[15][16]
**** Petroleum engineering salaries[edit] ****
Petroleum engineering has historically been one of the highest paid engineering
disciplines, although there is a tendency for mass layoffs when oil prices
decline and waves of hiring as prices rise. SPE annually conducts a salary
survey. In 2017, SPE reported that the average SPE professional member reported
earning USD $194,649 (including salary and bonus), and the average base pay was
USD $151,122.[17] The average base pay reported in 2016 was $143,006.[17] Base
pay and other compensation was on average was highest in the United States
where the base pay was USD $174,283. Drilling and production engineers tended
to make the best base pay, USD $160,026 for drilling engineers and USD $158,964
for production engineers. Base pay on average ranged from USD $96,382-174,283.
[18] There are still significant gender pay gaps, which may be explained by
males having an average of 19.4 years of experience and females having an
average of 12.7 years, and in 2017 more than half of female respondents
reported an increase in base pay received since 2016.[18]
In 2017, the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported the median pay for petroleum engineers was USD $132,280, or roughly
$63.60 per hour.[10][19] The same summary projects that there will be 15% job
growth in this field from 2016 to 2026.[19] Also in 2016, U.S. News & World
Report named petroleum engineering the top college major in terms of highest
median annual wages of college-educated workers (age 25-59).[20] The 2010
National_Association_of_Colleges_and_Employers survey showed petroleum
engineers as the highest paid 2010 graduates, at an average annual salary of
$125,220.[21] For individuals with experience, salaries can range from $170,000
to $260,000. They make an average of $112,000 a year and about $53.75 per hour.
In a 2007 article, Forbes.com reported that petroleum engineering was the 24th
best paying job in the United States.[22]
***** Sub-disciplines[edit] *****
Petroleum engineers divide themselves into several types:[1]
    * Reservoir_engineers work to optimize production of oil and gas via proper
      placement, production rates, and enhanced oil recovery techniques.
    * Drilling_engineers manage the technical aspects of drilling exploratory,
      production and injection wells.
    * Drilling_fluid_engineers A mud engineer (correctly called a Drilling
      Fluids Engineer, but most often referred to as the "Mud Man") works on an
      oil well or gas well drilling rig, and is responsible ensuring the
      properties of the drilling fluid, also known as drilling mud, are within
      designed specifications.
    * Completion_engineers (also known as subsurface engineers) work to design
      and oversee the implementation of techniques aimed at ensuring wells are
      drilled stably and with the maximum opportunity for oil and gas
      production.
    * Production_engineers manage the interface between the reservoir and the
      well, including perforations, sand control, downhole flow control, and
      downhole monitoring equipment; evaluate artificial_lift methods; and
      select surface equipment that separates the produced fluids (oil, natural
      gas, and water).
