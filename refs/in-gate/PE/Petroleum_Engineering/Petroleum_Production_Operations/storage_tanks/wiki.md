Storage tanks are containers that hold liquids, compressed gases (gas tank; or
in U.S.A "pressure vessel", which is not typically labeled or regulated as a
storage tank) or mediums used for the short- or long-term storage of heat or
cold.[1] The term can be used for reservoirs (artificial lakes and ponds), and
for manufactured containers. The usage of the word tank for reservoirs is
uncommon in American_English but is moderately common in British_English. In
other countries, the term tends to refer only to artificial containers.
In the USA, storage tanks operate under no (or very little) pressure,
distinguishing them from pressure vessels. Storage tanks are often cylindrical
in shape, perpendicular to the ground with flat bottoms, and a fixed flangible
or floating roof. There are usually many environmental regulations applied to
the design and operation of storage tanks, often depending on the nature of the
fluid contained within. Above-ground_storage_tanks (ASTs) differ from
underground_storage_tanks (USTs) in the kinds of regulations that are applied.
Above ground storage tanks can be used to hold materials such as petroleum,
waste matter, water, chemicals, and other hazardous materials, all while
meeting strict industry standards and regulations.[2]
Reservoirs can be covered, in which case they may be called covered or
underground storage tanks or reservoirs. Covered_water_tanks are common in
urban areas.
Storage tanks are available in many shapes: vertical and horizontal
cylindrical; open top and closed top; flat bottom, cone bottom, slope bottom
and dish bottom. Large tanks tend to be vertical cylindrical, or to have
rounded corners transition from vertical side wall to bottom profile, to easier
withstand hydraulic hydrostatically induced pressure of contained liquid. Most
container tanks for handling liquids during transportation are designed to
handle varying degrees of pressure.
A large storage tank is sometimes mounted on a lorry (truck) or on an
articulated_lorry trailer, which is then called a tanker.
In the U.S., air emissions, which correspond to losses for usable liquid
commodities and/or salable products, are typically required to undergo air
quality permitting under the Federal Clean Air Act. Quantification of potential
emissions for permitting purposes is most often accomplished by applying
emission equations published in Chapter 7.1 of the U.S. EPA's AP-42:
Compilation of Air Emission Factors.

***** Special features[edit] *****
Cylindrical fuel storage tank with fixed roof and internal floating roof.
Capacity approx 2,000,000 litres
Since most liquids can spill, evaporate, or seep through even the smallest
opening, special consideration must be made for their safe and secure handling.
This usually involves building a bunding, or containment dike, around the tank,
so that any leakage may be safely contained.
Some storage tanks need a floating roof in addition to or in lieu of the fixed
roof and structure. This floating roof rises and falls with the liquid level
inside the tank, thereby decreasing the vapor space above the liquid level.
Floating roofs are considered a safety requirement as well as a pollution
prevention measure for many industries including petroleum refining.
In the United States, metal tanks in contact with soil and containing petroleum
products must be protected from corrosion to prevent escape of the product into
the environment.[3] The most effective and common corrosion control techniques
for steel in contact with soil is cathodic_protection. Outside the United
States and at some locations in the United States, elevated tank support
foundations with a sand bitumen mix finish are often used. These type of
foundations keep the tank bottom plates free from water, hence prevent
corrosion.
***** For refineries[edit] *****
Tanks for a particular fluid are chosen according to the flash-point of that
substance. Generally in refineries and especially for liquid fuels, there are
fixed roof tanks, and floating roof tanks.
   1. Fixed_roof_tanks are meant for liquids with very high flash points, (e.g.
      fuel oil, water, bitumen etc.) Cone roofs, dome roofs and umbrella roofs
      are usual. These are insulated to prevent the clogging of certain
      materials, wherein the heat is provided by steam coils within the tanks.
      Dome roof tanks are meant for tanks having slightly higher storage
      pressure than that of atmosphere (e.g. slop oil).
   2. Floating_roof_tanks are broadly divided into external_floating_roof_tanks
      (usually called floating roof tanks: FR Tanks) and internal floating roof
      types (IFR Tanks).
IFR tanks are used for liquids with low flash-points (e.g., ATF, MS. gasoline,
ethanol). These tanks are nothing but cone roof tanks with a floating roof
inside which travels up and down along with the liquid level. This floating
roof traps the vapor from low flash-point fuels. Floating roofs are supported
with legs or cables on which they rest. FR tanks do not have a fixed roof (it
is open in the top) and has a floating roof only. Medium flash point liquids
such as naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and crude oil are stored in these tanks.
One of the common types found in mining areas is the open roof type tank,
usually to store ore slurries. These are the easiest storage tanks to build.
Other classifications which can be made for storage tanks are based upon their
location in a refinery:
    * COT- crude oil tank-ages
    * PIT- product and intermediate storage tankages
    * DISPATCH- dispatch area tankages
    * UTILITIES- tanks made in the power plant area, for storage water etc.
    * OSBL tanks- the first 3 types come under out side battery limit tankages
    * ISBL tanks- these are usually mini tanks which are found in the
      production units of a refinery (as neutralisation tanks, water tanks
      etc.)
As flash-points of fuels go very low the tanks are usually spherical (known as
spheres), to store LPG, hydrogen, hexane, nitrogen, oxygen etc.
***** Other types of tank[edit] *****
**** Atmospheric[edit] ****
An atmospheric tank is a container for holding a liquid at atmospheric
pressure. The major design code for welded atmospheric tanks are API 650 and
API 620. API 653 is used for analysis of in-service storage tanks. In Europe
the design code is EN14015 using load cases from Eurocode_3 (EN 1993), part 4-
2.
**** High pressure[edit] ****
Horizontal, cylindrical shell, elliptical heads carbon steel pressure_vessel
Main article: Gas_cylinder
In the case of a liquefied gas such as hydrogen or chlorine, or a compressed
gas such as compressed_natural_gas or MAPP, the storage tank must be made to
withstand the sometimes immense pressures exerted by the contents. These tanks
may be called cylinders and, being pressure_vessels, are sometimes excluded
from the class of "tanks".
**** Thermal storage tanks[edit] ****
One form of seasonal_thermal_energy_storage (STES) is the use of large surface
water tanks that are insulated and then covered with earth berms to enable the
year-round of solar-thermal heat that is collected primarily in the summer for
all-year heating.[4] A related technology has become widespread in Danish
district heating systems. The thermal storage medium is gravel and water in
large, shallow, lined pits that are covered with insulation, soil and grass.[5]
Ice_and_slush_tanks are used for short-term of cold for use in air
conditioning, allowing refrigeration equipment to be run at night when electric
power is less expensive, yet provide cooling during hot daytime hours.
**** Milk tank[edit] ****
Main article: Bulk_tank
In dairy farming a bulk milk cooling tank is a large storage tank for cooling
and holding milk at a cold temperature until it can be picked up by a milk
hauler. Since milk leaves the udder at approximately 35 Â°C and retains a
natural resistance to bacteria after extraction, milk tanks are used for rapid
cooling to a storage temperature of around 4 Â°C to 6 Â°C, and prevent further
growth of microorganisms.[6] The bulk milk cooling tank is an important milk
farm equipment. It is usually made of stainless steel and used every day to
store the raw milk on the farm in good condition. It must be cleaned after each
milk collection. The milk cooling tank can be the property of the farmer or
being rented to the farmer by the dairy plant.
**** Septic tank[edit] ****
Main article: Septic_tank
A septic tank is part of a small scale sewage_treatment system often referred
to as a septic system. Septic systems are commonly used to treat wastewater
from homes and small businesses in rural and suburban areas.[7] It consists of
the tank and a septic_drain_field. Waste water enters the tank where solids can
settle and scum floats. Anaerobic_digestion occurs on the settled solids,
reducing the volume of solids. The water released by the system is normally
absorbed by the drain field without needing any further treatment.
**** Mobile "storage" tanks[edit] ****
While not strictly a "storage" tank, mobile tanks share many of the same
features of storage tanks. Also, they must be designed to deal with a heavy
sloshing load and the risk of collision or other accident. Some of these
include ocean-going oil_tankers and LNG_carriers; railroad tank_cars; and the
road and highway traveling tankers. Also included are the holding_tanks which
are the tanks that store toilet waste on RVs, boats and aircraft.
***** Materials of construction[edit] *****
While steel and concrete remain one of the most popular choices for tanks,
glass-reinforced_plastic, thermoplastic and polyethylene tanks are increasing
in popularity. They offer lower build costs and greater chemical resistance,
especially for storage of speciality chemicals. There are several relevant
standards, such as British_Standard 4994 (1989), DVS (German_Welding_Institute)
2205, and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) RTP-1 [8] which give
advice on wall thickness, quality control procedures, testing procedures,
accreditation, fabrication and design criteria of final product.
***** Tank failures[edit] *****
There have been numerous catastrophic failures of storage tanks, one of the
most notorious being that which occurred at Boston Massachusetts USA on January
14, 1919. The large tank had only been filled eight times when it failed, and
resulting wave of molasses killed 21 people in the vicinity. The Boston
molasses_disaster was caused by poor design and construction, with a wall too
thin to bear repeated loads from the contents. The tank had not been tested
before use by filling with water, and was also poorly riveted. The owner of the
tank, United_States_Industrial_Alcohol_Company, paid out $300,000 (nearly $4
million in 2012 ) in compensation to the victims or their relatives.
There have been many other accidents caused by tanks since then, often caused
by faulty welding or by sub-standard steel. New inventions have at least fixed
some of the more common issues around the tanks' seal.[9][10] However, storage
tanks also present another problem, surprisingly, when empty. If they have been
used to hold oil or oil products such as gasoline, the atmosphere in the tanks
may be highly explosive as the space fills with hydrocarbons. If new welding
operations are started, then sparks can easily ignite the contents, with
disastrous results for the welders. The problem is similar to that of empty
bunkers on tanker_ships, which are now required to use an inert_gas blanket to
prevent explosive atmospheres building up from residues.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word "tank" originally meant "artificial lake" and came from India, perhaps
via Portuguese tanque. It may have some connection with:
    * Some Indian language words similar to "tak" or "tank" and meaning
      "reservoir for water". In Sanskrit a holding pond or reservoir is called
      a tadaka. Gujarati talao means "man-made lake". These uses of the word
      were incorporated into the English language.[11]
    * The Arabic verb istanqa`a Ø§ÙØ³ÙØªÙÙÙÙÙØ¹Ù = "it [i.e. some
      liquid] collected and became stagnant".
