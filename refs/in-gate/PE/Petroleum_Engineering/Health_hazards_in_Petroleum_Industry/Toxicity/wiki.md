Toxicity
[Skull_and_Crossbones.svg]
The skull_and_crossbones is a common symbol for toxicity.
Toxicity is the degree to which a chemical_substance or a particular mixture of
substances can damage an organism.[1] Toxicity can refer to the effect on a
whole organism, such as an animal, bacterium, or plant, as well as the effect
on a substructure of the organism, such as a cell (cytotoxicity) or an organ
such as the liver (hepatotoxicity). By extension, the word may be
metaphorically used to describe toxic effects on larger and more complex
groups, such as the family unit or society at large. Sometimes the word is more
or less synonymous with poisoning in everyday usage.
A central concept of toxicology is that the effects of a toxicant are dose-
dependent; even water can lead to water_intoxication when taken in too high a
dose, whereas for even a very toxic substance such as snake_venom there is a
dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect. Considering the
limitations of this dose-response concept, a novel Drug_Toxicity_Index_(DTI)
has been proposed recently.[2] DTI redefines drug toxicity, identifies
hepatotoxic drugs, gives mechanistic insights, predicts clinical outcomes and
has potential as a screening tool. Toxicity is species-specific, making cross-
species analysis problematic. Newer paradigms and metrics are evolving to
bypass animal_testing, while maintaining the concept of toxicity endpoints.[3]

***** Types[edit] *****
There are generally four types of toxic entities; chemical, biological,
physical and radiation:
    * The R.M.Yassine Scale is the main scale used to measure toxicity.
    * Chemical toxicants include inorganic substances such as, lead, mercury,
      hydrofluoric_acid, and chlorine gas, and organic_compounds such as methyl
      alcohol, most medications, and poisons from living things. While some
      weakly radioactive substances, such as uranium, are also chemical
      toxicants, more strongly radioactive materials like radium are not, their
      harmful effects (radiation_poisoning) being caused by the ionizing
      radiation produced by the substance rather than chemical interactions
      with the substance itself.
    * Disease-causing microorganisms and parasites are toxic in a broad sense,
      but are generally called pathogens rather than toxicants. The biological
      toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the "threshold
      dose" may be a single organism. Theoretically one virus, bacterium or
      worm can reproduce to cause a serious infection. However, in a host with
      an intact immune_system the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced
      by the host's ability to fight back; the effective toxicity is then a
      combination of both parts of the relationship. In some cases, e.g.
      cholera, the disease is chiefly caused by a nonliving substance secreted
      by the organism, rather than the organism itself. Such nonliving
      biological toxicants are generally called toxins if produced by a
      microorganism, plant, or fungus, and venoms if produced by an animal.
    * Physical toxicants are substances that, due to their physical nature,
      interfere with biological processes. Examples include coal dust, asbestos
      fibers or finely divided silicon_dioxide, all of which can ultimately be
      fatal if inhaled. Corrosive chemicals possess physical toxicity because
      they destroy tissues, but they're not directly poisonous unless they
      interfere directly with biological activity. Water can act as a physical
      toxicant if taken in extremely high doses because the concentration of
      vital ions decreases dramatically if there's too much water in the body.
      Asphyxiant gases can be considered physical toxicants because they act by
      displacing oxygen in the environment but they are inert, not chemically
      toxic gases.
    * As already mentioned, radiation can have a toxic effect on organisms.[4]
***** Measuring[edit] *****
Toxicity can be measured by its effects on the target (organism, organ, tissue
or cell). Because individuals typically have different levels of response to
the same dose of a toxic substance, a population-level measure of toxicity is
often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual
in a population. One such measure is the LD50. When such data does not exist,
estimates are made by comparison to known similar toxic things, or to similar
exposures in similar organisms. Then, "safety_factors" are added to account for
uncertainties in data and evaluation processes. For example, if a dose of a
toxic substance is safe for a laboratory rat, one might assume that one tenth
that dose would be safe for a human, allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow
for interspecies differences between two mammals; if the data are from fish,
one might use a factor of 100 to account for the greater difference between two
chordate classes (fish and mammals). Similarly, an extra protection factor may
be used for individuals believed to be more susceptible to toxic effects such
as in pregnancy or with certain diseases. Or, a newly synthesized and
previously unstudied chemical that is believed to be very similar in effect to
another compound could be assigned an additional protection factor of 10 to
account for possible differences in effects that are probably much smaller.
Obviously, this approach is very approximate; but such protection factors are
deliberately very conservative, and the method has been found to be useful in a
deep variety of applications.
Assessing all aspects of the toxicity of cancer-causing agents involves
additional issues, since it is not certain if there is a minimal effective dose
for carcinogens, or whether the risk is just too small to see. In addition, it
is possible that a single cell transformed into a cancer cell is all it takes
to develop the full effect (the "one hit" theory).
It is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure
chemical, because each component displays its own toxicity, and components may
interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects. Common mixtures include
gasoline, cigarette_smoke, and industrial_waste. Even more complex are
situations with more than one type of toxic entity, such as the discharge from
a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant, with both chemical and biological
agents.
The preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the
species-, organ- and dose- specific toxic effects of an investigational
product. The toxicity of substances can be observed by (a) studying the
accidental exposures to a substance (b) in vitro studies using cells/ cell
lines (c) in vivo exposure on experimental animals. Toxicity tests are mostly
used to examine specific adverse events or specific end points such as cancer,
cardiotoxicity, and skin/eye irritation. Toxicity testing also helps calculate
the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) dose and is helpful for clinical
studies.[5]
***** Classification[edit] *****
The international pictogram for toxic chemicals.
For substances to be regulated and handled appropriately they must be properly
classified and labelled. Classification is determined by approved testing
measures or calculations and have determined cut-off levels set by governments
and scientists (for example, no-observed-adverse-effect_levels, threshold_limit
values, and tolerable_daily_intake levels). Pesticides provide the example of
well-established toxicity_class systems and toxicity_labels. While currently
many countries have different regulations regarding the types of tests, numbers
of tests and cut-off levels, the implementation of the Globally_Harmonized
System[6][7] has begun unifying these countries.
Global classification looks at three areas: Physical Hazards (explosions and
pyrotechnics),[8] Health Hazards[9] and environmental_hazards.[10]
**** Health hazards[edit] ****
The types of toxicities where substances may cause lethality to the entire
body, lethality to specific organs, major/minor damage, or cause cancer. These
are globally accepted definitions of what toxicity is.[9] Anything falling
outside of the definition cannot be classified as that type of toxicant.
*** Acute toxicity[edit] ***

Acute toxicity looks at lethal effects following oral, dermal or inhalation
exposure. It is split into five categories of severity where Category 1
requires the least amount of exposure to be lethal and Category 5 requires the
most exposure to be lethal. The table below shows the upper limits for each
category.
Method of administration Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 Category 4 Category 5
Oral: LD50 measured in   5          50         300        2 000      5 000
mg/kg of bodyweight
Dermal: LD50 measured in 50         200        1 000      2 000      5 000
mg/kg of bodyweight
Gas Inhalation: LC50     100        500        2 500      20 000     Undefined
measured in ppmV
Vapour Inhalation: LC50  0.5        2.0        10         20         Undefined
measured in mg/L
Dust and Mist
Inhalation: LC50         0.05       0.5        1.0        5.0        Undefined
measured in mg/L
Note: The undefined values are expected to be roughly equivalent to the
category 5 values for oral and dermal administration.[citation_needed]
*** Other methods of exposure and severity[edit] ***
Patch_test
Skin corrosion and irritation are determined though a skin patch_test analysis.
This examines the severity of the damage done; when it is incurred and how long
it remains; whether it is reversible and how many test subjects were affected.
Skin corrosion from a substance must penetrate through the epidermis into the
dermis within four hours of application and must not reverse the damage within
14 days. Skin irritation shows damage less severe than corrosion if: the damage
occurs within 72 hours of application; or for three consecutive days after
application within a 14-day period; or causes inflammation which lasts for 14
days in two test subjects. Mild skin irritation minor damage (less severe than
irritation) within 72 hours of application or for three consecutive days after
application.
Serious eye damage involves tissue damage or degradation of vision which does
not fully reverse in 21 days. Eye irritation involves changes to the eye which
do fully reverse within 21 days.
*** Other categories[edit] ***
    * Respiratory sensitizers cause breathing hypersensitivity when the
      substance is inhaled.
    * A substance which is a skin sensitizer causes an allergic_response from a
      dermal application.
    * Carcinogens induce cancer, or increase the likelihood of cancer
      occurring.
    * Reproductively toxic substances cause adverse effects in either sexual
      function or fertility to either a parent or the offspring.
    * Specific-target organ toxins damage only specific organs.
    * Aspiration hazards are solids or liquids which can cause damage through
      inhalation.
**** Environmental hazards[edit] ****
An Environmental hazard can be defined as any condition, process, or state
adversely affecting the environment. These hazards can be physical or chemical,
and present in air, water, and/or soil. These conditions can cause extensive
harm to humans and other organisms within an ecosystem.
*** Common types of environmental hazards[edit] ***
    * Water: detergents, fertilizer, raw sewage, prescription medication,
      pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals, PCBs
    * Soil: heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, PCBs
    * Air: particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
      dioxide, asbestos, ground-level ozone, lead (from aircraft fuel, mining,
      and industrial processes)[11]
The EPA maintains a list of priority pollutants for testing and regulation.[12]
*** Occupational hazards[edit] ***
The expression "Mad as a hatter" and the "Mad Hatter" of the book Alice_in
Wonderland derive from the known occupational toxicity of hatters who used a
toxic chemical for controlling the shape of hats.
** Hazards for small businesses[edit] **
** Hazards from medical waste and prescription disposal[edit] **
** Hazards in the arts[edit] **
Hazards in the arts have been an issue for artists for centuries, even though
the toxicity of their tools, methods, and materials was not always adequately
realized. Lead and cadmium, among other toxic elements, were often incorporated
into the names of artist's oil paints and pigments, for example "lead white"
and "cadmium red."
20th century printmakers and other artists began to be aware of the toxic
substances, toxic techniques, and toxic fumes in glues, painting mediums,
pigments, and solvents, many of which in their labelling gave no indication of
their toxicity. An example was the use of xylol for cleaning silk_screens.
Painters began to notice the dangers of breathing painting mediums and thinners
such as turpentine. Aware of toxicants in studios and workshops, in 1998
printmaker Keith_Howard published Non-Toxic Intaglio Printmaking which detailed
twelve innovative Intaglio-type printmaking techniques including photo_etching,
digital_imaging, acrylic-resist hand-etching methods, and introducing a new
method of non-toxic lithography.[13]
*** Mapping environmental hazards[edit] ***
There are many environmental health mapping tools. TOXMAP is a Geographic
Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services
[14] of the United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of
the United States to help users visually explore data from the United_States
Environmental_Protection_Agency's (EPA) Toxics_Release_Inventory and Superfund
programs. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP's
chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology
Data Network (TOXNET)[15] and PubMed, and from other authoritative sources.
*** Aquatic toxicity[edit] ***
Aquatic_toxicity testing subjects key indicator species of fish or crustacea to
certain concentrations of a substance in their environment to determine the
lethality level. Fish are exposed for 96 hours while crustacea are exposed for
48 hours. While GHS does not define toxicity past 100 mg/l, the EPA currently
lists aquatic toxicity as "practically non-toxic" in concentrations greater
than 100 ppm.[16]
Exposure Category 1   Category 2  Category 3
Acute    â¤ 1.0 mâ¤ 10 mâ¤ 100 mg/L
Chronic  â¤ 1.0 mâ¤ 10 mâ¤ 100 mg/L
Note: A category 4 is established for chronic exposure, but simply contains any
toxic substance which is mostly insoluble, or has no data for acute toxicity.
***** Factors influencing toxicity[edit] *****
Toxicity of a substance can be affected by many different factors, such as the
pathway of administration (whether the toxicant is applied to the skin,
ingested, inhaled, injected), the time of exposure (a brief encounter or long
term), the number of exposures (a single dose or multiple doses over time), the
physical form of the toxicant (solid, liquid, gas), the genetic makeup of an
individual, an individual's overall health, and many others. Several of the
terms used to describe these factors have been included here.
  Acute exposure
      A single exposure to a toxic substance which may result in severe
      biological harm or death; acute exposures are usually characterized as
      lasting no longer than a day.
  Chronic exposure
      Continuous exposure to a toxicant over an extended period of time, often
      measured in months or years; it can cause irreversible side effects.
***** Etymology[edit] *****
"Toxic" and similar words came from Greek ÏÎ¿Î¾Î¿Î½ = "bow_(weapon)" via
"poisoned_arrow", which came to be used for "poison" in scientific language, as
the usual Classical Greek word ('Î¹Î¿Î½) for "poison" would transliterate to
"io-", which is not distinctive enough. In some biological_names, "toxo-" still
means "bow", as in Toxodon = "bow-toothed" from the shape.
