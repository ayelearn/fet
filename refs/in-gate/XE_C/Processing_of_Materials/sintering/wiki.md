Clinker nodules produced by sintering
Sintering or frittage is the process of compacting and forming a solid mass of
material by heat[1] or pressure[2] without melting it to the point of
liquefaction.
Sintering happens naturally in mineral deposits or as a manufacturing process
used with metals, ceramics, plastics, and other materials. The atoms in the
materials diffuse across the boundaries of the particles, fusing the particles
together and creating one solid piece. Because the sintering temperature does
not have to reach the melting_point of the material, sintering is often chosen
as the shaping process for materials with extremely high melting points such as
tungsten and molybdenum. The study of sintering in metallurgy powder-related
processes is known as powder_metallurgy. An example of sintering can be
observed when ice cubes in a glass of water adhere to each other, which is
driven by the temperature difference between the water and the ice. Examples of
pressure-driven sintering are the compacting of snowfall to a glacier, or the
forming of a hard snowball by pressing loose snow together.
The word "sinter" comes from the Middle_High_German sinter, a cognate of
English "cinder".

***** General sintering[edit] *****
Cross section of a sintering tool and the sintered part
Sintering is effective when the process reduces the porosity and enhances
properties such as strength, electrical_conductivity, translucency and thermal
conductivity; yet, in other cases, it may be useful to increase its strength
but keep its gas absorbency constant as in filters or catalysts. During the
firing process, atomic diffusion drives powder surface elimination in different
stages, starting from the formation of necks between powders to final
elimination of small pores at the end of the process.
The driving force for densification is the change in free energy from the
decrease in surface area and lowering of the surface free energy by the
replacement of solid-vapor interfaces. It forms new but lower-energy solid-
solid interfaces with a total decrease in free energy occurring. On a
microscopic scale, material transfer is affected by the change in pressure and
differences in free energy across the curved surface. If the size of the
particle is small (and its curvature is high), these effects become very large
in magnitude. The change in energy is much higher when the radius of curvature
is less than a few micrometres, which is one of the main reasons why much
ceramic technology is based on the use of fine-particle materials.[3]
For properties such as strength and conductivity, the bond area in relation to
the particle size is the determining factor. The variables that can be
controlled for any given material are the temperature and the initial grain
size, because the vapor pressure depends upon temperature. Through time, the
particle radius and the vapor pressure are proportional to (p0)2/3 and to
(p0)1/3, respectively.[3]
The source of power for solid-state processes is the change in free or chemical
potential energy between the neck and the surface of the particle. This energy
creates a transfer of material through the fastest means possible; if transfer
were to take place from the particle volume or the grain boundary between
particles, then there would be particle reduction and pore destruction. The
pore elimination occurs faster for a trial with many pores of uniform size and
higher porosity where the boundary diffusion distance is smaller. For the
latter portions of the process, boundary and lattice diffusion from the
boundary become important.[3]
Control of temperature is very important to the sintering process, since grain-
boundary diffusion and volume diffusion rely heavily upon temperature, the size
and distribution of particles of the material, the materials composition, and
often the sintering environment to be controlled.[3]
***** Ceramic sintering[edit] *****
Sintering is part of the firing process used in the manufacture of pottery and
other ceramic objects. These objects are made from substances such as glass,
alumina, zirconia, silica, magnesia, lime, beryllium_oxide, and ferric_oxide.
Some ceramic raw materials have a lower affinity for water and a lower
plasticity_index than clay, requiring organic additives in the stages before
sintering. The general procedure of creating ceramic objects via sintering of
powders includes:
    * Mixing water, binder, deflocculant, and unfired ceramic powder to form a
      slurry;
    * Spray-drying the slurry;
    * Putting the spray dried powder into a mold and pressing it to form a
      green body (an unsintered ceramic item);
    * Heating the green body at low temperature to burn off the binder;
    * Sintering at a high temperature to fuse the ceramic particles together.
All the characteristic temperatures associated with phase transformation, glass
transitions, and melting points, occurring during a sinterisation cycle of a
particular ceramics formulation (i.e., tails and frits) can be easily obtained
by observing the expansion-temperature curves during optical_dilatometer
thermal analysis. In fact, sinterisation is associated with a remarkable
shrinkage of the material because glass phases flow once their transition
temperature is reached, and start consolidating the powdery structure and
considerably reducing the porosity of the material.
Sintering is performed at high temperature. Additionally, a second and/or third
external force (such as pressure, electrical current) could be used. A commonly
used second external force is pressure. So, the sintering that is performed
just using temperature is generally called "pressureless sintering".
Pressureless sintering is possible with graded metal-ceramic composites, with a
nanoparticle sintering aid and bulk molding technology. A variant used for 3D
shapes is called hot_isostatic_pressing.
To allow efficient stacking of product in the furnace during sintering and
prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using ceramic
powder separator sheets. These sheets are available in various materials such
as alumina, zirconia and magnesia. They are additionally categorized by fine,
medium and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to
the ware being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced while
maximizing furnace loading.
***** Sintering of metallic powders[edit] *****
Iron_powder
Most, if not all, metals can be sintered. This applies especially to pure
metals produced in vacuum which suffer no surface contamination. Sintering
under atmospheric pressure requires the use of a protective gas, quite often
endothermic_gas. Sintering, with subsequent reworking, can produce a great
range of material properties. Changes in density, alloying, and heat treatments
can alter the physical characteristics of various products. For instance, the
Young's_modulus En of sintered iron powders remains somewhat insensitive to
sintering time, alloying, or particle size in the original powder for lower
sintering temperatures, but depends upon the density of the final product:
    E  n    /  E = ( D  /  d  )  3.4     {\displaystyle E_{n}/E=(D/d)^{3.4}}
[{\displaystyle E_{n}/E=(D/d)^{3.4}}]
where D is the density, E is Young's modulus and d is the maximum density of
iron.
Sintering is static when a metal powder under certain external conditions may
exhibit coalescence, and yet reverts to its normal behavior when such
conditions are removed. In most cases, the density of a collection of grains
increases as material flows into voids, causing a decrease in overall volume.
Mass movements that occur during sintering consist of the reduction of total
porosity by repacking, followed by material transport due to evaporation and
condensation from diffusion. In the final stages, metal atoms move along
crystal boundaries to the walls of internal pores, redistributing mass from the
internal bulk of the object and smoothing pore walls. Surface_tension is the
driving force for this movement.
A special form of sintering (which is still considered part of powder
metallurgy) is liquid-state sintering in which at least one but not all
elements are in a liquid state. Liquid-state sintering is required for making
cemented_carbide and tungsten_carbide.
Sintered bronze in particular is frequently used as a material for bearings,
since its porosity allows lubricants to flow through it or remain captured
within it. Sintered copper may be used as a wicking structure in certain types
of heat_pipe construction, where the porosity allows a liquid agent to move
through the porous material via capillary_action. For materials that have high
melting points such as molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, tantalum, osmium and
carbon, sintering is one of the few viable manufacturing processes. In these
cases, very low porosity is desirable and can often be achieved.
Sintered metal powder is used to make frangible shotgun shells called breaching
rounds, as used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked
room. These shotgun shells are designed to destroy door deadbolts, locks and
hinges without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed
through the door. They work by destroying the object they hit and then
dispersing into a relatively harmless powder.
Sintered bronze and stainless steel are used as filter materials in
applications requiring high temperature resistance while retaining the ability
to regenerate the filter element. For example, sintered stainless steel
elements are employed for filtering steam in food and pharmaceutical
applications, and sintered bronze in aircraft hydraulic systems.
Sintering of powders containing precious metals such as silver and gold is used
to make small jewelry items.
**** Advantages[edit] ****
Particular advantages of the powder technology include:
   1. Very high levels of purity and uniformity in starting materials
   2. Preservation of purity, due to the simpler subsequent fabrication process
      (fewer steps) that it makes possible
   3. Stabilization of the details of repetitive operations, by control of
      grain size during the input stages
   4. Absence of binding contact between segregated powder particles â or
      "inclusions" (called stringering) â as often occurs in melting
      processes
   5. No deformation needed to produce directional elongation of grains
   6. Capability to produce materials of controlled, uniform porosity.
   7. Capability to produce nearly net-shaped objects.
   8. Capability to produce materials which cannot be produced by any other
      technology.
   9. Capability to fabricate high-strength material like turbine blades.
  10. After sintering the mechanical strength to handling becomes higher.
The literature contains many references on sintering dissimilar materials to
produce solid/solid-phase compounds or solid/melt mixtures at the processing
stage. Almost any substance can be obtained in powder form, through either
chemical, mechanical or physical processes, so basically any material can be
obtained through sintering. When pure elements are sintered, the leftover
powder is still pure, so it can be recycled.
**** Disadvantages[edit] ****
Particular disadvantages of the powder technology include:
   1. 100% sintered (iron ore) cannot be charged in the blast furnace.[citation
      needed]
   2. Sintering cannot create uniform sizes.
   3. Micro- and nano-structures produced before sintering are often destroyed.
***** Plastics sintering[edit] *****
Plastic materials are formed by sintering for applications that require
materials of specific porosity. Sintered plastic porous components are used in
filtration and to control fluid and gas flows. Sintered plastics are used in
applications requiring caustic fluid separation processes such as the nibs in
whiteboard markers, inhaler filters, and vents for caps and liners on packaging
materials.[4] Sintered ultra_high_molecular_weight_polyethylene materials are
used as ski and snowboard base materials. The porous texture allows wax to be
retained within the structure of the base material, thus providing a more
durable wax coating.
***** Liquid phase sintering[edit] *****
For materials that are difficult to sinter, a process called liquid phase
sintering is commonly used. Materials for which liquid phase sintering is
common are Si3N4, WC, SiC, and more. Liquid phase sintering is the process of
adding an additive to the powder which will melt before the matrix phase. The
process of liquid phase sintering has three stages:
    * Rearrangement â As the liquid melts capillary action will pull the
      liquid into pores and also cause grains to rearrange into a more
      favorable packing arrangement.
    * Solution-Precipitation â In areas where capillary pressures are high
      (particles are close together) atoms will preferentially go into solution
      and then precipitate in areas of lower chemical potential where particles
      are not close or in contact. This is called "contact flattening". This
      densifies the system in a way similar to grain boundary diffusion in
      solid state sintering. Ostwald_ripening will also occur where smaller
      particles will go into solution preferentially and precipitate on larger
      particles leading to densification.
    * Final Densification â densification of solid skeletal network, liquid
      movement from efficiently packed regions into pores.
For liquid phase sintering to be practical the major phase should be at least
slightly soluble in the liquid phase and the additive should melt before any
major sintering of the solid particulate network occurs, otherwise
rearrangement of grains will not occur. Liquid phase sintering was successfully
applied to improve grain_growth of thin semiconductor layers from nanoparticle
precursor films.[5]
***** Electric current assisted sintering[edit] *****
These techniques employ electric currents to drive or enhance sintering.[6]
English engineer A. G. Bloxam registered in 1906 the first patent on sintering
powders using direct_current in vacuum. The primary purpose of his inventions
was the industrial scale production of filaments for incandescent_lamps by
compacting tungsten or molybdenum particles. The applied current was
particularly effective in reducing surface oxides that increased the emissivity
of the filaments.[7]
In 1913, Weintraub and Rush patented a modified sintering method which combined
electric current with pressure. The benefits of this method were proved for the
sintering of refractory_metals as well as conductive carbide or nitride
powders. The starting boronâcarbon or siliconâcarbon powders were placed in
an electrically_insulating tube and compressed by two rods which also served as
electrodes for the current. The estimated sintering temperature was 2000 Â°C.
[7]
In the United States, sintering was first patented by Duval dâAdrian in 1922.
His three-step process aimed at producing heat-resistant blocks from such oxide
materials as zirconia, thoria or tantalia. The steps were: (i) molding the
powder; (ii) annealing it at about 2500 Â°C to make it conducting; (iii)
applying current-pressure sintering as in the method by Weintraub and Rush.[7]
Sintering that uses an arc produced via a capacitance discharge to eliminate
oxides before direct current heating, was patented by G. F. Taylor in 1932.
This originated sintering methods employing pulsed or alternating_current,
eventually superimposed to a direct current. Those techniques have been
developed over many decades and summarized in more than 640 patents.[7]
Of these technologies the most well known is resistance sintering (also called
hot_pressing) and spark_plasma_sintering, while electro_sinter_forging is the
latest advancement in this field.
**** Spark plasma sintering[edit] ****
In spark_plasma_sintering (SPS), external pressure and an electric field are
applied simultaneously to enhance the densification of the metallic/ceramic
powder compacts. However, after commercialization it was determined there is no
plasma, so the proper name is spark sintering as coined by Lenel. The electric
field driven densification supplements sintering with a form of hot pressing,
to enable lower temperatures and shorter amount of time than typical sintering.
[8] For a number of years, it was speculated that the existence of sparks or
plasma between particles could aid sintering; however, Hulbert and coworkers
systematically proved that the electric parameters used during spark plasma
sintering make it (highly) unlikely.[9] In light of this, the name "spark
plasma sintering" has been rendered obsolete. Terms such as "Field Assisted
Sintering Technique" (FAST), "Electric Field Assisted Sintering" (EFAS), and
Direct Current Sintering (DCS) have been implemented by the sintering
community.[10] Using a DC pulse as the electric current, spark plasma, spark
impact pressure, joule heating, and an electrical field diffusion effect would
be created.[11] By modifying the graphite die design and its assembly, it was
demonstrated to create Pressureless_sintering condition in spark_plasma
sintering facility. This modified die design setup is reported to synergize the
advantages of both conventional pressureless sintering and spark plasma
sintering techniques.[12]
**** Electro sinter forging[edit] ****
Electro_sinter_forging is an electric current assisted sintering (ECAS)
technology originated from capacitor_discharge_sintering. It is used for the
production of diamond metal matrix composites and under evaluation for the
production of hard metals,[13] nitinol[14] and other metals and intermetallics.
It is characterized by a very low sintering time allowing machines to sinter at
the same speed as a compaction press.
***** Pressureless sintering[edit] *****
Pressureless sintering is the sintering of a powder compact (sometimes at very
high temperatures, depending on the powder) without applied pressure. This
avoids density variations in the final component, which occurs with more
traditional hot pressing methods.[15]
The powder compact (if a ceramic) can be created by slip_casting, injection
moulding, and cold_isostatic_pressing. After pre-sintering, the final green
compact can be machined to its final shape before sintered.
Three different heating schedules can be performed with pressureless sintering:
constant-rate of heating (CRH), rate-controlled sintering (RCS), and two-step
sintering (TSS). The microstructure and grain size of the ceramics may vary
depending on the material and method used.[15]
Constant-rate of heating (CRH), also known as temperature-controlled sintering,
consists of heating the green compact at a constant rate up to the sintering
temperature.[16] Experiments with zirconia have been performed to optimize the
sintering temperature and sintering rate for CRH method. Results showed that
the grain sizes were identical when the samples were sintered to the same
density, proving that grain size is a function of specimen density rather than
CRH temperature mode.
In rate-controlled sintering (RCS), the densification rate in the open-porosity
phase is lower than in the CRH method.[16] By definition, the relative density,
Ïrel, in open-porosity phase is lower than 90%. Although this should prevent
separation of pores from grain boundaries, it has been proven statistically
that RCS did not produce smaller grain sizes than CRH for alumina, zirconia,
and ceria samples.[15]
Two-step sintering (TSS) uses two different sintering temperatures. The first
sintering temperature should guarantee a relative density higher than 75% of
theoretical sample density. This will remove supercritical pores from the body.
The sample will then be cooled down and held at the second sintering
temperature until densification is completed. Grains of cubic zirconia and
cubic strontium titanate were significantly refined by TSS compared to CRH.
However, the grain size changes in other ceramic materials, like tetragonal
zirconia and hexagonal alumina, were not statistically significant.[15]
***** Microwave sintering[edit] *****
In microwave sintering, heat is sometimes generated internally within the
material, rather than via surface radiative heat transfer from an external heat
source. Some materials fail to couple and others exhibit run-away behavior, so
it is restricted in usefulness. A benefit of microwave sintering is faster
heating for small loads, meaning less time is needed to reach the sintering
temperature, less heating energy required and improvements in the product
properties.[17]
A failing of microwave sintering is that it generally sinters only one compact
at a time, so overall productivity turns out to be poor except for situations
involving one of a kind sintering, such as for artists. As microwaves can only
penetrate a short distance in materials with a high conductivity and a high
permeability, microwave sintering requires the sample to be delivered in
powders with a particle size around the penetration depth of microwaves in the
particular material. The sintering process and side-reactions run several times
faster during microwave sintering at the same temperature, which results in
different properties for the sintered product.[17]
This technique is acknowledged to be quite effective in maintaining fine
grains/nano sized grains in sintered bioceramics. Magnesium phosphates and
calcium phosphates are the examples which have been processed through microwave
sintering technique[18]
***** Densification, vitrification and grain growth[edit] *****
Sintering in practice is the control of both densification and grain_growth.
Densification is the act of reducing porosity in a sample thereby making it
more dense. Grain growth is the process of grain boundary motion and Ostwald
ripening to increase the average grain size. Many properties (mechanical
strength, electrical breakdown strength, etc.) benefit from both a high
relative density and a small grain size. Therefore, being able to control these
properties during processing is of high technical importance. Since
densification of powders requires high temperatures, grain growth naturally
occurs during sintering. Reduction of this process is key for many engineering
ceramics.
For densification to occur at a quick pace it is essential to have (1) an
amount of liquid phase that is large in size, (2) a near complete solubility of
the solid in the liquid, and (3) wetting of the solid by the liquid. The power
behind the densification is derived from the capillary pressure of the liquid
phase located between the fine solid particles. When the liquid phase wets the
solid particles, each space between the particles becomes a capillary in which
a substantial capillary pressure is developed. For submicrometre particle
sizes, capillaries with diameters in the range of 0.1 to 1 micrometres develop
pressures in the range of 175 pounds per square inch (1,210 kPa) to 1,750
pounds per square inch (12,100 kPa) for silicate liquids and in the range of
975 pounds per square inch (6,720 kPa) to 9,750 pounds per square inch
(67,200 kPa) for a metal such as liquid cobalt.[3]
Densification requires constant capillary_pressure where just solution-
precipitation material transfer would not produce densification. For further
densification, additional particle movement while the particle undergoes grain-
growth and grain-shape changes occurs. Shrinkage would result when the liquid
slips between particles and increase pressure at points of contact causing the
material to move away from the contact areas forcing particle centers to draw
near each other.[3]
The sintering of liquid-phase materials involves a fine-grained solid phase to
create the needed capillary pressures proportional to its diameter and the
liquid concentration must also create the required capillary pressure within
range, else the process ceases. The vitrification rate is dependent upon the
pore size, the viscosity and amount of liquid phase present leading to the
viscosity of the overall composition, and the surface tension. Temperature
dependence for densification controls the process because at higher
temperatures viscosity decreases and increases liquid content. Therefore, when
changes to the composition and processing are made, it will affect the
vitrification process.[3]
**** Sintering mechanisms[edit] ****
Sintering occurs by diffusion of atoms through the microstructure. This
diffusion is caused by a gradient of chemical potential â atoms move from an
area of higher chemical potential to an area of lower chemical potential. The
different paths the atoms take to get from one spot to another are the
sintering mechanisms. The six common mechanisms are:
    * Surface diffusion â Diffusion of atoms along the surface of a particle
    * Vapor transport â Evaporation of atoms which condense on a different
      surface
    * Lattice diffusion from surface â atoms from surface diffuse through
      lattice
    * Lattice diffusion from grain boundary â atom from grain boundary
      diffuses through lattice
    * Grain boundary diffusion â atoms diffuse along grain boundary
    * Plastic deformation â dislocation motion causes flow of matter
Also one must distinguish between densifying and non-densifying mechanisms.
1â3 above are non-densifying[citation_needed] â they take atoms from the
surface and rearrange them onto another surface or part of the same surface.
These mechanisms simply rearrange matter inside of porosity and do not cause
pores to shrink. Mechanisms 4â6 are densifying mechanisms[citation_needed]
â atoms are moved from the bulk to the surface of pores thereby eliminating
porosity and increasing the density of the sample.
**** Grain growth[edit] ****
Main article: Grain_growth
A grain_boundary(GB) is the transition area or interface between adjacent
crystallites (or grains) of the same chemical and lattice composition, not to
be confused with a phase_boundary. The adjacent grains do not have the same
orientation of the lattice thus giving the atoms in GB shifted positions
relative to the lattice in the crystals. Due to the shifted positioning of the
atoms in the GB they have a higher energy state when compared with the atoms in
the crystal lattice of the grains. It is this imperfection that makes it
possible to selectively etch the GBs when one wants the microstructure visible.
[19]
Striving to minimize its energy leads to the coarsening of the microstructure
to reach a metastable state within the specimen. This involves minimizing its
GB area and changing its topological structure to minimize its energy. This
grain growth can either be normal_or_abnormal, a normal grain growth is
characterized by the uniform growth and size of all the grains in the specimen.
Abnormal_grain_growth is when a few grains grow much larger than the remaining
majority.[20]
*** Grain boundary energy/tension[edit] ***
The atoms in the GB are normally in a higher energy state than their equivalent
in the bulk material. This is due to their more stretched bonds, which gives
rise to a GB tension      &#x03C3;  G B     {\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}}
[\sigma _{{GB}}]. This extra energy that the atoms possess is called the grain
boundary energy,      &#x03B3;  G B     {\displaystyle \gamma _{GB}}  [\gamma _
{{GB}}]. The grain will want to minimize this extra energy thus striving to
make the grain boundary area smaller and this change requires energy.[20]
âOr, in other words, a force has to be applied, in the plane of the grain
boundary and acting along a line in the grain-boundary area, in order to extend
the grain-boundary area in the direction of the force. The force per unit
length, i.e. tension/stress, along the line mentioned is ÏGB. On the basis of
this reasoning it would follow:
    &#x03C3;  G B   d A  &#xA0;(work done)  =  &#x03B3;  G B   d A  &#xA0;
(energy change)      {\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}dA{\text{ (work done)}}=\gamma
_{GB}dA{\text{ (energy change)}}\,\!}
[{\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}dA{\text{ (work done)}}=\gamma _{GB}dA{\text{
(energy change)}}\,\!}]
with dA as the increase of grain-boundary area per unit length along the line
in the grain-boundary area considered.â[20][pg 478]
The GB tension can also be thought of as the attractive forces between the
atoms at the surface and the tension between these atoms is due to the fact
that there is a larger interatomic distance between them at the surface
compared to the bulk (i.e. surface_tension). When the surface area becomes
bigger the bonds stretch more and the GB tension increases. To counteract this
increase in tension there must be a transport of atoms to the surface keeping
the GB tension constant. This diffusion of atoms accounts for the constant
surface tension in liquids. Then the argument,
    &#x03C3;  G B   d A  &#xA0;(work done)  =  &#x03B3;  G B   d A  &#xA0;
(energy change)      {\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}dA{\text{ (work done)}}=\gamma
_{GB}dA{\text{ (energy change)}}\,\!}
[{\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}dA{\text{ (work done)}}=\gamma _{GB}dA{\text{
(energy change)}}\,\!}]
holds true. For solids, on the other hand, diffusion of atoms to the surface
might not be sufficient and the surface tension can vary with an increase in
surface area.[21]
For a solid, one can derive an expression for the change in Gibbs free energy,
dG, upon the change of GB area, dA. dG is given by
    &#x03C3;  G B   d A  &#xA0;(work done)  = d G  &#xA0;(energy change)  =
&#x03B3;  G B   d A + A d  &#x03B3;  G B       {\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}dA
{\text{ (work done)}}=dG{\text{ (energy change)}}=\gamma _{GB}dA+Ad\gamma _
{GB}\,\!}
[{\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}dA{\text{ (work done)}}=dG{\text{ (energy
change)}}=\gamma _{GB}dA+Ad\gamma _{GB}\,\!}]
which gives
    &#x03C3;  G B   =  &#x03B3;  G B   +    A d  &#x03B3;  G B     d A
{\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}=\gamma _{GB}+{\frac {Ad\gamma _{GB}}{dA}}\,\!}
[{\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}=\gamma _{GB}+{\frac {Ad\gamma _{GB}}{dA}}\,\!}]
    &#x03C3;  G B     {\displaystyle \sigma _{GB}}  [\sigma _{{GB}}] is
normally expressed in units of       N m     {\displaystyle {\frac {N}{m}}}  [
{\frac  {N}{m}}] while      &#x03B3;  G B     {\displaystyle \gamma _{GB}}
[\gamma _{{GB}}] is normally expressed in units of       J  m  2
{\displaystyle {\frac {J}{m^{2}}}}  [{\frac  {J}{m^{2}}}]     ( J = N m )
{\displaystyle (J=Nm)}  [(J=Nm)] since they are different physical properties.
[20]
*** Mechanical equilibrium[edit] ***
In a two-dimensional isotropic_material the grain boundary tension would be the
same for the grains. This would give angle of 120Â° at GB junction where three
grains meet. This would give the structure a hexagonal pattern which is the
metastable state (or mechanical_equilibrium) of the 2D specimen. A consequence
of this is that to keep trying to be as close to the equilibrium as possible.
Grains with fewer sides than six will bend the GB to try keep the 120Â° angle
between each other. This results in a curved boundary with its curvature
towards itself. A grain with six sides will, as mentioned, have straight
boundaries while a grain with more than six sides will have curved boundaries
with its curvature away from itself. A grain with six boundaries (i.e.
hexagonal structure) are in a metastable state (i.e. local equilibrium) within
the 2D structure.[20] In three dimensions structural details are similar but
much more complex and the metastable structure for a grain is a non-regular 14-
sided polyhedra with doubly curved faces. In practice all arrays of grains are
always unstable and thus always grows until its prevented by a counterforce.
[22]
Grains strive to minimize their energy, and a curved boundary has a higher
energy than a straight boundary. This means that the grain boundary will
migrate towards the curvature.[clarification_needed] The consequence of this is
that grains with less than 6 sides will decrease in size while grains with more
than 6 sides will increase in size.[23]
Grain growth occurs due to motion of atoms across a grain boundary. Convex
surfaces have a higher chemical potential than concave surfaces therefore grain
boundaries will move toward their center of curvature. As smaller particles
tend to have a higher radius of curvature and this results in smaller grains
losing atoms to larger grains and shrinking. This is a process called Ostwald
ripening. Large grains grow at the expense of small grains.
Grain growth in a simple model is found to follow:
    G  m   =  G  0   m   + K t   {\displaystyle G^{m}=G_{0}^{m}+Kt}
[{\displaystyle G^{m}=G_{0}^{m}+Kt}]
Here G is final average grain size, G0 is the initial average grain size, t is
time, m is a factor between 2 and 4, and K is a factor given by:
   K =  K  0    e    &#x2212; Q   R T       {\displaystyle K=K_{0}e^{\frac {-Q}
{RT}}}
[{\displaystyle K=K_{0}e^{\frac {-Q}{RT}}}]
Here Q is the molar activation energy, R is the ideal gas constant, T is
absolute temperature, and K0 is a material dependent factor. In most materials
the sintered grain size is proportion to the inverse square root of the
fractional porosity, implying that pores are the most effective retardant for
grain growth during sintering.
**** Reducing grain growth[edit] ****
  Solute ions
If a dopant is added to the material (example: Nd in BaTiO3) the impurity will
tend to stick to the grain boundaries. As the grain boundary tries to move (as
atoms jump from the convex to concave surface) the change in concentration of
the dopant at the grain boundary will impose a drag on the boundary. The
original concentration of solute around the grain boundary will be asymmetrical
in most cases. As the grain boundary tries to move the concentration on the
side opposite of motion will have a higher concentration and therefore have a
higher chemical potential. This increased chemical potential will act as a
backforce to the original chemical potential gradient that is the reason for
grain boundary movement. This decrease in net chemical potential will decrease
the grain boundary velocity and therefore grain growth.
  Fine second phase particles
If particles of a second phase which are insoluble in the matrix phase are
added to the powder in the form of a much finer powder than this will decrease
grain boundary movement. When the grain boundary tries to move past the
inclusion diffusion of atoms from one grain to the other will be hindered by
the insoluble particle. Since it is beneficial for particles to reside in the
grain boundaries and they exert a force in opposite direction compared to the
grain boundary migration. This effect is called the Zener effect after the man
who estimated this drag force to
   F = &#x03C0; r &#x03BB; sin &#x2061; ( 2 &#x03B8; )     {\displaystyle F=\pi
r\lambda \sin(2\theta )\,\!}
[{\displaystyle F=\pi r\lambda \sin(2\theta )\,\!}]
where r is the radius of the particle and Î» the interfacial energy of the
boundary if there are N particles per unit volume their volume fraction f is
   f =   4 3   &#x03C0;  r  3   N     {\displaystyle f={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^
{3}N\,\!}
[{\displaystyle f={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}N\,\!}]
assuming they are randomly distributed. A boundary of unit area will intersect
all particles within a volume of 2r which is 2Nr particles. So the number of
particles n intersecting a unit area of grain boundary is:
   n =    3 f   2 &#x03C0;  r  2          {\displaystyle n={\frac {3f}{2\pi r^
{2}}}\,\!}
[{\displaystyle n={\frac {3f}{2\pi r^{2}}}\,\!}]
Now assuming that the grains only grow due to the influence of curvature, the
driving force of growth is        2 &#x03BB;  R     {\displaystyle {\frac
{2\lambda }{R}}}  [{\frac  {2\lambda }{R}}] where (for homogeneous grain
structure) R approximates to the mean diameter of the grains. With this the
critical diameter that has to be reached before the grains ceases to grow:
   n  F  m a x   =    2 &#x03BB;   D  c r i t         {\displaystyle nF_{max}=
{\frac {2\lambda }{D_{crit}}}\,\!}
[{\displaystyle nF_{max}={\frac {2\lambda }{D_{crit}}}\,\!}]
This can be reduced to
    D  c r i t   =    4 r   3 f        {\displaystyle D_{crit}={\frac {4r}
{3f}}\,\!}
[{\displaystyle D_{crit}={\frac {4r}{3f}}\,\!}]
so the critical diameter of the grains is dependent of the size and volume
fraction of the particles at the grain boundaries.[24]
It has also been shown that small bubbles or cavities can act as inclusion
More complicated interactions which slow grain boundary motion include
interactions of the surface energies of the two grains and the inclusion and
are discussed in detail by C.S. Smith.[25]
***** Natural sintering in geology[edit] *****
Petrifying spring in RÃ©otier near Mont-Dauphin, France
In geology a natural sintering occurs when a mineral spring brings about a
deposition of chemical sediment or crust, for example as of porous silica.[26]
A sinter is a mineral deposit that presents a porous or vesicular texture; its
structure shows small cavities. These may be siliceous deposits or calcareous
deposits.[27]
Siliceous_sinter is a deposit of opaline or amorphous silica which appears as
incrustations near hot_springs and geysers. It sometimes forms conical mounds,
called geyser cones, but can also form as a terrace. The main agents
responsible for the deposition of siliceous sinter are algae and other
vegetation in the water. Altering of wall rocks can also form sinters near
fumaroles and in the deeper channels of hot_springs. Examples of siliceous
sinter are geyserite and fiorite. They can be found in many places, including
Iceland, El_Tatio geothermal field in Chile, New_Zealand, and Yellowstone
National_Park and Steamboat_Springs in the United States.
Calcareous_sinter is also called tufa, calcareous tufa, or calc-tufa. It is a
deposit of calcium_carbonate, as with travertine. Called petrifying springs,
they are quite common in limestone districts. Their calcareous waters deposit a
sintery incrustation on surrounding objects. The precipitation is assisted with
mosses and other vegetable structures, thus leaving cavities in the calcareous
sinter after they have decayed.[27]

***** Sintering of catalysts[edit] *****
Sintering is an important cause for loss of catalyst activity, especially on
supported metal catalysts. It decreases the surface area of the catalyst and
changes the surface structure.[28] For a porous catalytic surface, the pores
may collapse due to sintering, resulting in loss of surface area. Sintering is
in general an irreversible process.[29]
Small catalyst particles (which have the highest relative surface areas) and a
high reaction temperature are in general both factors that increase the
reactivity of a catalyst. However, these factors are also the circumstances
under which sintering occurs.[30] Specific materials may also increase the rate
of sintering. On the other hand, by alloying catalysts with other materials,
sintering can be reduced. Rare-earth_metals in particular have been shown to
reduce sintering of metal catalysts when alloyed.[31]
For many supported_metal_catalysts, sintering starts to become a significant
effect at temperatures over 500 Â°C (932 Â°F).[28] Catalysts that operate at
higher temperatures, such as a car_catalyst, use structural improvements to
reduce or prevent sintering. These improvements are in general in the form of a
support made from an inert and thermally stable material such as silica, carbon
or alumina.[32]
