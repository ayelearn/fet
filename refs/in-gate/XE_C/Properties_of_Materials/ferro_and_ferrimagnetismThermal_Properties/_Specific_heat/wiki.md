For specific heats of particular substances, see Table_of_specific_heat
capacities.
The specific heat capacity of a substance is the heat_capacity of a sample of
the substance divided by the mass of the sample. Informally, it is the amount
of energy that must be added, in the form of heat, to one unit of mass of the
substance in order to cause an increase of one unit in its temperature. The SI
unit of specific heat is joule per kelvin per kilogram, J/K/kg or J/(K kg).[1]
[2] For example, at a temperature of 25 Â°C, the heat required to raise the
temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 K (equivalent to 1 Â°C) is 4179.6 joules,
meaning that the specific heat of water is 4.1796 kJÂ·kgâ1Â·Kâ1.[3]
The specific heat often varies with temperature, and is different for each
state_of_matter. Liquid water has one of the highest specific heats among
common substances, about 4182 J/K/kg at 20Â°C; but that of ice just below 0Â°C
is only 2093 J/K/kg. The specific heats of iron, granite, oak_wood, and
hydrogen gas are about 449, 790, 2400, and 14300 J/K/kg, respectively. While
the substance is undergoing a phase_transition, such as melting or boiling, its
specific heat is technically infinite, because the heat goes into changing its
state rather than raising its temperature.
The specific heat of a substance, especially a gas, may be significantly higher
when it is allowed to expand as it is heated (specific heat at constant
pressure) than when is heated in a closed vessel that prevents expansion
(specific heat at constant volume). These two values are usually denoted by
c  P     {\displaystyle c_{P}}  [c_{P}] and      c  V     {\displaystyle c_{V}}
[c_{V}], respectively; their quotient     &#x03B3; =  c  P    /   c  V
{\displaystyle \gamma =c_{P}/c_{V}}  [{\displaystyle \gamma =c_{P}/c_{V}}]is
the heat_capacity_ratio.
In some contexts, however, the term specific heat capacity (or specific heat)
may refer to the ratio between the specific heats of a substance at a given
temperature and of a reference substance at a reference temperature, such as
water at 15Â°C;[4] much in the fashion of specific_gravity.
If the amount of substance is measured as a number of moles, one gets the molar
heat_capacity instead (whose SI unit is joule per kelvin per mole, J/K/mol). If
the amount is taken to be the volume of the sample (as is sometimes done in
engineering), one gets the volumetric_heat_capacity (whose SI unit is joule per
kelvin per cubic_meter, J/K/m3).
One of the first scientists to use the concept was Joseph_Black, 18th-century
medical doctor and professor of Medicine at Glasgow_University. He measured the
specific heat of many substances, using the term capacity for heat.[5]

***** Definition[edit] *****
The specific heat capacity of a substance, usually denoted by     c
{\displaystyle c}  [c], is the heat capacity     C   {\displaystyle C}  [C] of
a sample of the substance, divided by the mass     M   {\displaystyle M}  [M]
of the sample:[6]
         c =   C M   =   1 M    lim  &#x0394; T &#x2192; 0      &#x0394; Q
      &#x0394; T      {\displaystyle c={\frac {C}{M}}={\frac {1}{M}}\lim _
      {\Delta T\rightarrow 0}{\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta T}}}  [{\displaystyle c=
      {\frac {C}{M}}={\frac {1}{M}}\lim _{\Delta T\rightarrow 0}{\frac {\Delta
      Q}{\Delta T}}}]
where     &#x0394; Q   {\displaystyle \Delta Q}  [\Delta Q] is the amount of
heat needed to uniformly raise the temperature of the sample by     &#x0394; T
{\displaystyle \Delta T}  [\Delta T].
Like the heat capacity of an object, the specific heat of a substance may vary,
sometimes substantially, depending on the starting temperature     T
{\displaystyle T}  [T] of the sample and the pressure     P   {\displaystyle P}
[P] applied to it. Therefore, it should be considered a function     c ( P , T
)   {\displaystyle c(P,T)}  [{\displaystyle c(P,T)}] of those two variables.
These parameters are usually specified when giving the specific heat of a
substance. For example, "Water (liquid):      c  P     {\displaystyle c_{P}}
[c_{P}] = 4185.5 J/K/kg (15 Â°C, 101.325 kPa)" [7] When not specified,
published values of the specific heat     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] generally
are valid for some standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure.
However, the dependency of     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] on starting
temperature and pressure can often be ignored in practical contexts, e.g. when
working in narrow ranges of those variables. In those contexts one usually
omits the qualifier     ( P , T )   {\displaystyle (P,T)}  [{\displaystyle
(P,T)}], and approximates the specific heat by a constant     c
{\displaystyle c}  [c] suitable for those ranges.
Specific heat is an "intensive" property of a substance, an intrinsic
characteristic that does not depend on the size or shape of the amount in
consideration. (The qualifier "specific" in front of an extensive property
often indicates an intensive property derived from it.[8])
**** Variations[edit] ****
The injection of heat energy into a substance, besides raising its temperature,
usually causes an increase in its volume and/or its pressure, depending on how
the sample is confined. The choice made about the latter affects the measured
specific heat, even for the same starting pressure     P   {\displaystyle P}
[P] and starting temperature     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T]. Two particular
choices are widely used:
    * If the pressure is kept constant (for instance, at the ambient
      atmospheric pressure), and the sample is allowed to expand, the expansion
      generates work as the force from the pressure displaces the enclosure or
      the surrounding fluid. That work must come from the heat energy provided.
      The specific heat thus obtained is said to be measured at constant
      pressure (or isobaric), and is often denoted      c  P     {\displaystyle
      c_{P}}  [{\displaystyle c_{P}}],      c  p     {\displaystyle c_{p}}  [c_
      {{p}}],      c   p      {\displaystyle c_{\mathrm {p} }}  [{\displaystyle
      c_{\mathrm {p} }}], etc.
    * On the other hand, if the expansion is prevented â for example by a
      sufficiently rigid enclosure, or by increasing the external pressure to
      counteract the internal one â no work is generated, and the heat energy
      that would have gone into it must instead contribute to the internal
      energy of the sample, including raising its temperature by an extra
      amount. The specific heat obtained this way is said to be measured at
      constant volume (or isochoric) and denoted      c  V     {\displaystyle
      c_{V}}  [{\displaystyle c_{V}}],      c  v     {\displaystyle c_{v}}  [c_
      {{v}}]      c   v      {\displaystyle c_{\mathrm {v} }}  [{\displaystyle
      c_{\mathrm {v} }}], etc.
The value of      c  V     {\displaystyle c_{V}}  [{\displaystyle c_{V}}] is
usually less than the value of      c  P     {\displaystyle c_{P}}  [
{\displaystyle c_{P}}]. This difference is particularly notable in gases where
values under constant pressure are typically 30% to 66.7% greater than those at
constant volume. Hence the heat_capacity_ratio of gases is typically between
1.3 and 1.67.[9]
**** Applicability[edit] ****
The specific heat can be defined and measured for gases, liquids, and solids of
fairly general composition and molecular structure. These include gas mixtures,
solutions and alloys, or heterogenous materials such as milk, sand, granite,
and concrete, if considered at a sufficiently large scale.
The specific heat can be defined also for materials that change state or
composition as the temperature and pressure change, as long as the changes are
reversible and gradual. Thus, for example, the concepts are definable for a gas
or liquid that dissociates as the temperature increases, as long as the
products of the dissociation promptly and completely recombine when it drops.
The specific heat is not meaningful if the substance undergoes irreversible
chemical changes, or if there is a phase_change, such as melting or boiling, at
a sharp temperature within the range of temperatures spanned by the
measurement.
***** Measurement[edit] *****
The specific heat of a substance is typically determined according to the
definition; namely, by measuring the heat capacity of a sample of the
substance, usually with a calorimeter, and dividing by the sample's mass.
[citation_needed]
The specific heat of gases can be measured at constant volume, by enclosing the
sample in a rigid container. On the other hand, measuring the specific heat at
constant volume can be prohibitively difficult for liquids and solids, since
one often would need impractical pressures in order to prevent the expansion
that would be caused by even small increases in temperature. Instead, the
common practice is to measure the specific heat at constant pressure (allowing
the material to expand or contract as it wishes), determine separately the
coefficient_of_thermal_expansion and the compressibility of the material, and
compute the specific heat at constant volume from these data according to the
laws of thermodynamics.[citation_needed]
***** Units[edit] *****
**** International system[edit] ****
The SI unit for specific heat is joule per kelvin per kilogram (J/K/kg, J/(kg
K), J Kâ1 kgâ1, etc.). Since an increment of temperature of one degree
Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, that is the same as joule
per degree Celsius per kilogram (J/Â°C/kg). Sometimes the gram is used instead
of kilogram for the unit of mass: 1 J/K/kg = 0.001 J/K/g.
The specific heat of a substance (per unit of mass) has dimension
L2Â·Tâ2Â·Îâ1, or (L/T)2/Î. Therefore, the SI unit J/K/kg is equivalent to
metre squared per second squared per kelvin (m2 Kâ1 sâ2).
**** English (Imperial) engineering units[edit] ****
Professionals in construction, civil_engineering, chemical_engineering, and
other technical disciplines, especially in the United_States, may use the so-
called English_Engineering_units, that include the Imperial pound (lb =
0.45459237 kg) as the unit of mass, the degree_Fahrenheit or Rankine (Â°F = 5/
9 K, about 0.555556 K) as the unit of temperature increment, and the British
thermal_unit (BTU â 1055.06 J),[10][11] as the unit of heat.
In those contexts, the unit of specific heat is BTU/Â°F/lb = 4177.6 J/K/kg. The
BTU was originally defined so that the average specific heat of water would be
1 BTU/Â°F/lb.
**** Calories[edit] ****
In chemistry, heat amounts were often measured in calories. Confusingly, two
units with that name, denoted "cal" or "Cal", have been commonly used to
measure amounts of heat:
    * the "small calorie" (or "gram-calorie", "cal") is 4.184 J, exactly. It
      was originally defined so that the specific heat of liquid water would be
      1 cal/CÂ°/g.
    * The "grand calorie" (also "kilocalorie", "kilogram-calorie", or "food
      calorie"; "kcal" or "Cal") is 1000 small calories, that is, 4184 J,
      exactly. It was originallly defined so that the specific heat of water
      would be 1 Cal/CÂ°/kg.
While these units are still used in some contexts (such as kilogram calorie in
nutrition), their use is now deprecated in technical and scientific fields.
When heat is measured in these units, the unit of specific heat is usually
            1 cal/Â°C/g ("small calorie") = 1 Cal/Â°C/kg = 1 kcal/Â°C/kg
            ("large calorie") = 4184 J/K/kg.
In either unit, the specific heat of water is approximately 1. The combinations
cal/Â°C/kg = 4.144 J/K/kg and kcal/Â°C/g = 4184,000 J/K/kg do not seem to be
widely used.
***** Physical basis of specific heat[edit] *****
Main article: molar_heat_capacity_Â§ Physical_basis
The temperature of a sample of a substance reflects the average kinetic_energy
of its constituent particles (atoms or molecules) relative to its center of
mass. However, not all energy provided to a sample of a substance will go into
raising its temperature.
**** Monoatomic gases[edit] ****
Quantum_mechanics predicts that, at room temperature and ordinary pressures, an
isolated atom in a gas cannot store any significant amount of energy except in
the form of kinetic energy. Thus, heat_capacity_per_mole is the same for all
monoatomic gases (such as the noble gases). More precisely,      c  V ,  m    =
3 R  /  2 &#x2248;     {\displaystyle c_{V,\mathrm {m} }=3R/2\approx {}}  [
{\displaystyle c_{V,\mathrm {m} }=3R/2\approx {}}]12.5 J/K/mol and      c  P ,
m    = 5 R  /  2 &#x2248;     {\displaystyle c_{P,\mathrm {m} }=5R/2\approx {}}
[{\displaystyle c_{P,\mathrm {m} }=5R/2\approx {}}]21 J/K/mol, where     R
&#x2248;     {\displaystyle R\approx {}}  [{\displaystyle R\approx {}}]8.31446
J/K/mol is the ideal_gas_constant (which is the product of Boltzmannâs
constant      k   B      {\displaystyle k_{\mathrm {B} }}  [k_{\mathrm{B}}] and
Avogadroâs_number).
Therefore, the specific heat (per unit of mass, not per mole) of a monoatomic
gas will be inversely proportional to its (adimensional) atomic_weight     A
{\displaystyle A}  [A]. That is, approximately,
          c  V   &#x2248;     {\displaystyle c_{V}\approx {}}  [{\displaystyle
      c_{V}\approx {}}]12470 J/K/kg     /  A     c  P   &#x2248;
      {\displaystyle /A\quad \quad \quad c_{P}\approx {}}  [{\displaystyle /
      A\quad \quad \quad c_{P}\approx {}}]20785 J/K/kg     /  A
      {\displaystyle /A}  [{\displaystyle /A}]
For the noble gases, from helium to xenon, these computed values are
Gas                                               He   Ne    Ar    Kr    Xe

    c  P     {\displaystyle c_{P}}  [c_{P}] (J/K/ 5197 1031  520.3 248.0 158.3
kg)
**** Polyatomic gases[edit] ****
On the other hand, a polyatomic gas molecule (consisting of two or more atoms
bound together) can store heat energy in other forms besides its kinetic
energy. These forms include rotation of the molecule, and vibration of the
atoms relative to its center of mass.
These extra degrees_of_freedom or "modes" contribute to the specific heat of
the substance. Namely, when heat energy is injected into a gas with polyatomic
molecules, only part of it will go into increasing their kinetic energy, and
hence the temperature; the rest will go to into those other degrees of freedom.
In order to achieve the same increase in temperature, more heat energy will
have to be provided to a mol of that substance than to a mol of a monoatomic
gas. Therefore, the specific heat of a polyatomic gas depends not only on its
molecular mass, but also on the number of degrees of freedom that the molecules
have. [12][13] [14]
Quantum mechanics further says that each rotational or vibrational mode can
only take or lose energy in certain discrete amount (quanta). Depending on the
temperature, the average heat energy per molecule may be too small compared to
the quantum needed to activate some of those degrees of freedom. Those modes
are said to be "frozen out". In that case, the specific heat of the substance
is going to increase with temperature, sometimes in a step-like fashion, as
more modes become unfrozen and start absorbing part of the input heat energy.
For example, the molar heat capacity of nitrogen N
2 at constant volume is      c  V ,  m    =     {\displaystyle c_{V,\mathrm {m}
}={}}  [{\displaystyle c_{V,\mathrm {m} }={}}] 20.6 J/K/mol (at 15Â°C, 1 atm),
which is 2.49    R   {\displaystyle R}  [R].[15] That is the value expected
from theory if each molecule had 5 degrees of freedom. These turn out to be
three degrees of the molecule's velocity vector, plus two degrees from its
rotation about an axis through the center of mass and perpendicular to the line
of the two atoms. Because of those two extra degrees of freedom, the specific
heat      c  V     {\displaystyle c_{V}}  [c_{V}] of N
2 (736 J/K/kg) is greater than that of an hypothetical monoatomic gas with the
same molecular mass 28 (445 J/K/kg), by a factor of 5/3.
This value for the specific heat of nitrogen is practically constant from below
â150Â°C to about 300Â°C. In that temperature range, the two additional
degrees of freedom that correspond to vibrations of the atoms, stretching and
compressing the bond, are still "frozen out". At about that temperature, those
modes begin to "un-freeze", and as a result      c  V     {\displaystyle c_{V}}
[c_{V}] starts to increase rapidly at first, then slower as it tends to another
constant value. It is 35.5 J/K/mol at 1500Â°C, 36.9 at 2500Â°C, and 37.5 at
3500Â°C.[16] The last value corresponds almost exactly to the predicted value
for 7 degrees of freedom per molecule.

***** Thermodynamic derivation[edit] *****
In theory, the specific heat of a substance can also be derived from its
abstract thermodynamic modeling by an equation_of_state and an internal_energy
function.
**** State of matter in a homogeneous sample[edit] ****
To apply the theory, one considers the sample of the substance (solid, liquid,
or gas) for which the specific heat can be defined; in particular, that it has
homogeneous composition and fixed mass     M   {\displaystyle M}  [M]. Assume
that the evolution of the system is always slow enough for the internal
pressure     P   {\displaystyle P}  [P] and temperature     T   {\displaystyle
T}  [T] be considered uniform throughout. The pressure     P   {\displaystyle
P}  [P] would be equal to the pressure applied to it by the enclosure or some
surrounding fluid, such as air.
The state of the material can then be specified by three parameters: its
temperature     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T], the pressure     P   {\displaystyle
P}  [P], and its specific_volume     V =   V    /  M   {\displaystyle V=
{\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V} }}/M}  [{\displaystyle V={\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V}
}}/M}], where       V     {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V} }}}  [
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V} }}}] is the volume of the sample.
(This quantity is the reciprocal     1  /  &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle 1/\rho }
[1/\rho ] of the material's density     &#x03C1; = M  /    V     {\displaystyle
\rho =M/{\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V} }}}  [{\displaystyle \rho =M/{\boldsymbol
{\mathrm {V} }}}].) Like     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] and     P
{\displaystyle P}  [P], the specific volume     V   {\displaystyle V}  [V] is
an intensive property of the material and its state, that does not depend on
the amount of subtance in the sample.
Those variables are not independent. The allowed states are defined by an
equation_of_state relating those three variables:     F ( T , P , V ) = 0.
{\displaystyle F(T,P,V)=0.}  [{\displaystyle F(T,P,V)=0.}] The function     F
{\displaystyle F}  [F] depends on the material under consideration. The
specific_internal_energy stored internally in the sample, per unit of mass,
will then be another function     U ( T , P , V )   {\displaystyle U(T,P,V)}  [
{\displaystyle U(T,P,V)}] of these state variables, that is also specific of
the material. The total internal energy in the sample then will be     M U ( T
, P , V )   {\displaystyle MU(T,P,V)}  [{\displaystyle MU(T,P,V)}].
For some simple materials, like an ideal_gas, one can derive from basic theory
the equation of state     F = 0   {\displaystyle F=0}  [F=0] and even the
specific internal energy     U   {\displaystyle U}  [U] In general, these
functions must be determined experimentally for each substance.
**** Conservation of energy[edit] ****
The absolute value of this quantity is undefined, and (for the purposes of
thermodynamics) the state of "zero internal energy" can be chosen arbitrarily.
However, by the law_of_conservation_of_energy, any infinitesimal increase     M
d  U   {\displaystyle M\mathrm {d} U}  [{\displaystyle M\mathrm {d} U}] in the
total internal energy     M U   {\displaystyle MU}  [{\displaystyle MU}] must
be matched by the net flow of heat energy      d  Q   {\displaystyle \mathrm
{d} Q}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} Q}] into the sample, plus any net
mechanical energy provided to it by enclosure or surrounding medium on it. The
latter is     &#x2212; P  d    V     {\displaystyle -P\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol
{\mathrm {V} }}}  [{\displaystyle -P\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V} }}}],
where      d    V     {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V} }}}
[{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V} }}}] is the change in the
sample's volume in that infinitesimal step.[17] Therefore
          d  Q &#x2212; P  d    V   = M  d  U   {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} Q-
      P\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V} }}=M\mathrm {d} U}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} Q-P\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {\mathrm {V}
      }}=M\mathrm {d} U}]
hence
             d  Q  M   &#x2212; P  d  V =  d  U   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {\mathrm {d} Q}{M}}-P\mathrm {d} V=\mathrm {d} U}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {\mathrm {d} Q}{M}}-P\mathrm {d} V=\mathrm {d} U}]
If the volume of the sample (hence the specific volume of the material) is kept
constant during the injection of the heat amount      d  Q   {\displaystyle
\mathrm {d} Q}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} Q}], then the term     P  d  V
{\displaystyle P\mathrm {d} V}  [{\displaystyle P\mathrm {d} V}] is zero (no
mechanical work is done). Then, dividing by      d  T   {\displaystyle \mathrm
{d} T}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T}],
             d  Q   M  d  T    =     d  U    d  T      {\displaystyle {\frac
      {\mathrm {d} Q}{M\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} U}{\mathrm {d} T}}}
      [{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} Q}{M\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {\mathrm
      {d} U}{\mathrm {d} T}}}]
where      d  T   {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d}
T}] is the change in temperature that resulted from the heat input. The left-
hand side is the specific heat at constant volume      c  V     {\displaystyle
c_{V}}  [c_{V}] of the material.
For the heat capacity at constant pressure, it is useful to define the specific
enthalpy of the system as the sum     H ( T , P , V ) = U ( T , P , V ) + P V
{\displaystyle H(T,P,V)=U(T,P,V)+PV}  [{\displaystyle H(T,P,V)=U(T,P,V)+PV}].
An infinitesimal change in the specific enthalpy will then be
          d  H =  d  U + V  d  P + P  d  V   {\displaystyle \mathrm {d}
      H=\mathrm {d} U+V\mathrm {d} P+P\mathrm {d} V}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm
      {d} H=\mathrm {d} U+V\mathrm {d} P+P\mathrm {d} V}]
therefore
             d  Q  M   + V  d  P =  d  H   {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d}
      Q}{M}}+V\mathrm {d} P=\mathrm {d} H}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d}
      Q}{M}}+V\mathrm {d} P=\mathrm {d} H}]
If the pressure is kept constant, the second term on the left-hand side is
zero, and
             d  Q   M  d  T    =     d  H    d  T      {\displaystyle {\frac
      {\mathrm {d} Q}{M\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} H}{\mathrm {d} T}}}
      [{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} Q}{M\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {\mathrm
      {d} H}{\mathrm {d} T}}}]
The left-hand side is the specific heat at constant pressure      c  P
{\displaystyle c_{P}}  [c_{P}] of the material.
**** Connection to equation of state[edit] ****
In general, the infinitesimal quantities      d  T ,  d  P ,  d  V ,  d  U
{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T,\mathrm {d} P,\mathrm {d} V,\mathrm {d} U}  [
{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T,\mathrm {d} P,\mathrm {d} V,\mathrm {d} U}] are
constrained by the equation of state and the specific internal energy function.
Namely,
          {       d  T    &#x2202; F   &#x2202; T    ( T , P , V ) +  d  P
      &#x2202; F   &#x2202; P    ( T , P , V ) +  d  V    &#x2202; F   &#x2202;
      V    ( T , P , V )    =   0       d  T    &#x2202; U   &#x2202; T    ( T
      , P , V ) +  d  P    &#x2202; U   &#x2202; P    ( T , P , V ) +  d  V
      &#x2202; U   &#x2202; V    ( T , P , V )    =    d  U
      {\displaystyle \left\{{\begin{array}{lcl}\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T
      {\frac {\partial F}{\partial T}}(T,P,V)+\mathrm {d} P{\frac {\partial F}
      {\partial P}}(T,P,V)+\mathrm {d} V{\frac {\partial F}{\partial V}}
      (T,P,V)&=&0\\[2ex]\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T{\frac {\partial U}{\partial
      T}}(T,P,V)+\mathrm {d} P{\frac {\partial U}{\partial P}}(T,P,V)+\mathrm
      {d} V{\frac {\partial U}{\partial V}}(T,P,V)&=&\mathrm {d} U\end
      {array}}\right.}  [{\displaystyle \left\{{\begin{array}{lcl}\displaystyle
      \mathrm {d} T{\frac {\partial F}{\partial T}}(T,P,V)+\mathrm {d} P{\frac
      {\partial F}{\partial P}}(T,P,V)+\mathrm {d} V{\frac {\partial F}
      {\partial V}}(T,P,V)&=&0\\[2ex]\displaystyle \mathrm {d} T{\frac
      {\partial U}{\partial T}}(T,P,V)+\mathrm {d} P{\frac {\partial U}
      {\partial P}}(T,P,V)+\mathrm {d} V{\frac {\partial U}{\partial V}}
      (T,P,V)&=&\mathrm {d} U\end{array}}\right.}]
Here     ( &#x2202; F  /  &#x2202; T ) ( T , P , V )   {\displaystyle (\partial
F/\partial T)(T,P,V)}  [{\displaystyle (\partial F/\partial T)(T,P,V)}] denotes
the (partial) derivative of the state equation     F   {\displaystyle F}  [F]
with respect to its     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] argument, keeping the other
two arguments fixed, evaluated at the state     ( T , P , V )   {\displaystyle
(T,P,V)}  [{\displaystyle (T,P,V)}] in question. The other partial derivatives
are defined in the same way. These two equations on the four infinitesimal
increments normally constrain them to a two-dimensional linear subspace space
of possible infinitesimal state changes, that depends on the material and on
the state. The constant-volume and constant-pressure changes are only two
particular directions in this space.
This analysis also holds no matter how the energy increment      d  Q
{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} Q}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} Q}] is injected into
the sample (by heat_conduction, irradiation, electromagnetic_induction,
radioactive_decay, etc.
**** Relation between heat capacities[edit] ****
For any specific volume     V   {\displaystyle V}  [V], denote      p  V   ( T
)   {\displaystyle p_{V}(T)}  [{\displaystyle p_{V}(T)}] the function that
describes how the pressure varies with the temperature     T   {\displaystyle
T}  [T], as allowed by the equation of state, when the specific volume of the
material is forcefully kept constant at     V   {\displaystyle V}  [V].
Analogously, for any pressure     P   {\displaystyle P}  [P], let      v  P
( T )   {\displaystyle v_{P}(T)}  [{\displaystyle v_{P}(T)}] be the function
that describes how the specific volume varies with the temperature, when the
pressure is kept constant at     P   {\displaystyle P}  [P]. Namely, those
functions are such that
         F ( T ,  p  V   ( T ) , V ) = 0       {\displaystyle F(T,p_{V}
      (T),V)=0\quad \quad {}}  [{\displaystyle F(T,p_{V}(T),V)=0\quad \quad
      {}}]and        F ( T , P ,  v  P   ( T ) ) = 0   {\displaystyle {}\quad
      \quad F(T,P,v_{P}(T))=0}  [{\displaystyle {}\quad \quad F(T,P,v_{P}
      (T))=0}]
for any values of     T , P , V   {\displaystyle T,P,V}  [{\displaystyle
T,P,V}]. In other words, the graphs of      p  V   ( T )   {\displaystyle p_{V}
(T)}  [{\displaystyle p_{V}(T)}] and      v  P   ( T )   {\displaystyle v_{P}
(T)}  [{\displaystyle v_{P}(T)}] are slices of the surface defined by the state
equation, cut by planes of constant     V   {\displaystyle V}  [V] and constant
P   {\displaystyle P}  [P], respectively.
Then, from the fundamental_thermodynamic_relation it follows that
          c  P   ( T , P , V ) &#x2212;  c  V   ( T , P , V ) = T  [      d   p
      V      d  T    ( T )  ]   [      d   v  P      d  T    ( T )  ]
      {\displaystyle c_{P}(T,P,V)-c_{V}(T,P,V)=T\left[{\frac {\mathrm {d} p_
      {V}}{\mathrm {d} T}}(T)\right]\left[{\frac {\mathrm {d} v_{P}}{\mathrm
      {d} T}}(T)\right]}  [{\displaystyle c_{P}(T,P,V)-c_{V}(T,P,V)=T\left[
      {\frac {\mathrm {d} p_{V}}{\mathrm {d} T}}(T)\right]\left[{\frac {\mathrm
      {d} v_{P}}{\mathrm {d} T}}(T)\right]}]
This equation can be rewritten as
          c  P   ( T , P , V ) &#x2212;  c  V   ( T , P , V ) = V T    &#x03B1;
      2    &#x03B2;  T     ,   {\displaystyle c_{P}(T,P,V)-c_{V}(T,P,V)=VT
      {\frac {\alpha ^{2}}{\beta _{T}}},}  [{\displaystyle c_{P}(T,P,V)-c_{V}
      (T,P,V)=VT{\frac {\alpha ^{2}}{\beta _{T}}},}]
where
         &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \alpha }  [\alpha ] is the coefficient_of
      thermal_expansion,
          &#x03B2;  T     {\displaystyle \beta _{T}}  [\beta _{T}] is the
      isothermal compressibility,
both depending on the state     ( T , P , V )   {\displaystyle (T,P,V)}  [
{\displaystyle (T,P,V)}].
The heat_capacity_ratio, or adiabatic index, is the ratio      c  P    /   c  V
{\displaystyle c_{P}/c_{V}}  [{\displaystyle c_{P}/c_{V}}] of the heat capacity
at constant pressure to heat capacity at constant volume. It is sometimes also
known as the isentropic expansion factor.
