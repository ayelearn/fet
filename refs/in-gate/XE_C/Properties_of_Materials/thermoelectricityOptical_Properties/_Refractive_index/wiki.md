A ray of light being refracted in a plastic block
In optics, the refractive index or index of refraction of a material is a
dimensionless_number that describes how fast light propagates through the
material. It is defined as
         n =   c v   ,   {\displaystyle n={\frac {c}{v}},}  [n={\frac {c}{v}},]
where c is the speed_of_light in vacuum and v is the phase_velocity of light in
the medium. For example, the refractive index of water is 1.333, meaning that
light travels 1.333 times as fast in vacuum as in water.
[Illustration_of_the_incidence_and_refraction_angles]
Refraction of a light ray
The refractive index determines how much the path of light is bent, or
refracted, when entering a material. This is described by Snell's_law of
refraction, n1 sinÎ¸1 = n2 sinÎ¸2, where Î¸1 and Î¸2 are the angles_of
incidence and refraction, respectively, of a ray crossing the interface between
two media with refractive indices n1 and n2. The refractive indices also
determine the amount of light that is reflected when reaching the interface, as
well as the critical angle for total_internal_reflection and Brewster's_angle.
[1]
The refractive index can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the
wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values:
the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, and similarly the wavelength in that
medium is Î» = Î»0/n, where Î»0 is the wavelength of that light in vacuum. This
implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and that the frequency (f = v/
Î») of the wave is not affected by the refractive index. As a result, the
perceived color of the refracted light to a human eye which depends on the
frequency is not affected by the refraction or the refractive index of the
medium.
While the refractive index affects wavelength, it depends on frequency, color
and energy so the resulting difference in the bending angles causes white light
to split into its constituent colors. This is called dispersion. It can be
observed in prisms and rainbows, and chromatic_aberration in lenses. Light
propagation in absorbing materials can be described using a complex-valued
refractive index.[2] The imaginary part then handles the attenuation, while the
real part accounts for refraction.
The concept of refractive index applies within the full electromagnetic
spectrum, from X-rays to radio_waves. It can also be applied to wave phenomena
such as sound. In this case the speed of sound is used instead of that of
light, and a reference medium other than vacuum must be chosen.[3]

***** Definition[edit] *****
The refractive index n of an optical medium is defined as the ratio of the
speed of light in vacuum, c = 299792458 m/s, and the phase_velocity v of light
in the medium,[1]
         n =   c v   .   {\displaystyle n={\frac {c}{v}}.}  [n={\frac {c}{v}}.]
The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests or the phase of the wave
moves, which may be different from the group_velocity, the speed at which the
pulse of light or the envelope of the wave moves.
The definition above is sometimes referred to as the absolute refractive index
or the absolute index of refraction to distinguish it from definitions where
the speed of light in other reference media than vacuum is used.[1]
Historically air at a standardized pressure and temperature has been common as
a reference medium.
***** History[edit] *****
[Stipple_engraving_of_Thomas_Young]
Thomas_Young coined the term index of refraction.
Thomas_Young was presumably the person who first used, and invented, the name
"index of refraction", in 1807.[4] At the same time he changed this value of
refractive power into a single number, instead of the traditional ratio of two
numbers. The ratio had the disadvantage of different appearances. Newton, who
called it the "proportion of the sines of incidence and refraction", wrote it
as a ratio of two numbers, like "529 to 396" (or "nearly 4 to 3"; for water).
[5] Hauksbee, who called it the "ratio of refraction", wrote it as a ratio with
a fixed numerator, like "10000 to 7451.9" (for urine).[6] Hutton wrote it as a
ratio with a fixed denominator, like 1.3358 to 1 (water).[7]
Young did not use a symbol for the index of refraction, in 1807. In the next
years, others started using different symbols: n, m, and Âµ.[8][9][10] The
symbol n gradually prevailed.

See also: List_of_refractive_indices
For visible_light most transparent media have refractive indices between 1 and
2. A few examples are given in the adjacent table. These values are measured at
the yellow doublet D-line of sodium, with a wavelength of 589 nanometers, as is
conventionally done.[15] Gases at atmospheric pressure have refractive indices
close to 1 because of their low density. Almost all solids and liquids have
refractive indices above 1.3, with aerogel as the clear exception. Aerogel is a
very low density solid that can be produced with refractive index in the range
from 1.002 to 1.265.[16] Moissanite lies at the other end of the range with a
refractive index as high as 2.65. Most plastics have refractive indices in the
range from 1.3 to 1.7, but some high-refractive-index_polymers can have values
as high as 1.76.[17]
For infrared light refractive indices can be considerably higher. Germanium is
transparent in the wavelength region from 2 to 14 Âµm and has a refractive
index of about 4.[18] A type of new materials, called topological insulator,
was recently found holding higher refractive index of up to 6 in near to mid
infrared frequency range. Moreover, topological insulator material are
transparent when they have nanoscale thickness. These excellent properties make
them a type of significant materials for infrared optics.[19]
**** Refractive index below unity[edit] ****
According to the theory_of_relativity, no information can travel faster than
the speed of light in vacuum, but this does not mean that the refractive index
cannot be less than 1. The refractive index measures the phase_velocity of
light, which does not carry information.[20] The phase velocity is the speed at
which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in
vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index below 1. This can occur close to
resonance_frequencies, for absorbing media, in plasmas, and for X-rays. In the
X-ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to 1
(exceptions close to some resonance frequencies).[21] As an example, water has
a refractive index of 0.99999974 = 1 â 2.6Ã10â7 for X-ray radiation at a
photon energy of 30 keV (0.04 nm wavelength).[21]
An example of a plasma with an index of refraction less than unity is Earth's
ionosphere. Since the refractive index of the ionosphere (a plasma), is less
than unity, electromagnetic waves propagating through the plasma are bent "away
from the normal" (see Geometric_optics) allowing the radio wave to be refracted
back toward earth, thus enabling long-distance radio communications. See also
Radio_Propagation and Skywave.[22]
**** Negative refractive index[edit] ****

fiberglass_circuit_boards]
A split-ring_resonator array arranged to produce a negative index of refraction
for microwaves
Recent research has also demonstrated the existence of materials with a
negative refractive index, which can occur if permittivity and permeability
have simultaneous negative values.[23] This can be achieved with periodically
constructed metamaterials. The resulting negative_refraction (i.e., a reversal
of Snell's_law) offers the possibility of the superlens and other exotic
phenomena.[24]
***** Microscopic explanation[edit] *****
Main article: EwaldâOseen_extinction_theorem
At the atomic scale, an electromagnetic wave's phase velocity is slowed in a
material because the electric_field creates a disturbance in the charges of
each atom (primarily the electrons) proportional to the electric_susceptibility
of the medium. (Similarly, the magnetic_field creates a disturbance
proportional to the magnetic_susceptibility.) As the electromagnetic fields
oscillate in the wave, the charges in the material will be "shaken" back and
forth at the same frequency.[1]:67 The charges thus radiate their own
electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency, but usually with a phase
delay, as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them (see
sinusoidally_driven_harmonic_oscillator). The light wave traveling in the
medium is the macroscopic superposition_(sum) of all such contributions in the
material: the original wave plus the waves radiated by all the moving charges.
This wave is typically a wave with the same frequency but shorter wavelength
than the original, leading to a slowing of the wave's phase velocity. Most of
the radiation from oscillating material charges will modify the incoming wave,
changing its velocity. However, some net energy will be radiated in other
directions or even at other frequencies (see scattering).
Depending on the relative phase of the original driving wave and the waves
radiated by the charge motion, there are several possibilities:
    * If the electrons emit a light wave which is 90Â° out of phase with the
      light wave shaking them, it will cause the total light wave to travel
      slower. This is the normal refraction of transparent materials like glass
      or water, and corresponds to a refractive index which is real and greater
      than 1.[25]
    * If the electrons emit a light wave which is 270Â° out of phase with the
      light wave shaking them, it will cause the wave to travel faster. This is
      called "anomalous refraction", and is observed close to absorption lines
      (typically in infrared spectra), with X-rays in ordinary materials, and
      with radio waves in Earth's ionosphere. It corresponds to a permittivity
      less than 1, which causes the refractive index to be also less than unity
      and the phase_velocity of light greater than the speed_of_light_in_vacuum
      c (note that the signal_velocity is still less than c, as discussed
      above). If the response is sufficiently strong and out-of-phase, the
      result is a negative value of permittivity and imaginary index of
      refraction, as observed in metals or plasma.[25]
    * If the electrons emit a light wave which is 180Â° out of phase with the
      light wave shaking them, it will destructively interfere with the
      original light to reduce the total light intensity. This is light
      absorption_in_opaque_materials and corresponds to an imaginary refractive
      index.
    * If the electrons emit a light wave which is in phase with the light wave
      shaking them, it will amplify the light wave. This is rare, but occurs in
      lasers due to stimulated_emission. It corresponds to an imaginary index
      of refraction, with the opposite sign to that of absorption.
For most materials at visible-light frequencies, the phase is somewhere between
90Â° and 180Â°, corresponding to a combination of both refraction and
absorption.
***** Dispersion[edit] *****
[A_rainbow]
Light of different colors has slightly different refractive indices in water
and therefore shows up at different positions in the rainbow.
[A_white_beam_of_light_dispersed_into_different_colors_when_passing_through_a
triangular_prism]
In a prism, dispersion causes different colors to refract at different angles,
splitting white light into a rainbow of colors.
[A_graph_showing_the_decrease_in_refractive_index_with_increasing_wavelength
for_different_types_of_glass]
The variation of refractive index with wavelength for various glasses. The
shaded zone indicates the range of visible light.
Main article: Dispersion_(optics)
The refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength (and frequency) of
light.[26] This is called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide
white light into its constituent spectral colors.[27] As the refractive index
varies with wavelength, so will the refraction angle as light goes from one
material to another. Dispersion also causes the focal_length of lenses to be
wavelength dependent. This is a type of chromatic_aberration, which often needs
to be corrected for in imaging systems. In regions of the spectrum where the
material does not absorb light, the refractive index tends to decrease with
increasing wavelength, and thus increase with frequency. This is called "normal
dispersion", in contrast to "anomalous dispersion", where the refractive index
increases with wavelength.[26] For visible light normal dispersion means that
the refractive index is higher for blue light than for red.
For optics in the visual range, the amount of dispersion of a lens material is
often quantified by the Abbe_number:[27]
         V =     n   y e l l o w    &#x2212; 1    n   b l u e    &#x2212;  n
      r e d       .   {\displaystyle V={\frac {n_{\mathrm {yellow} }-1}{n_
      {\mathrm {blue} }-n_{\mathrm {red} }}}.}  [V={\frac {n_{\mathrm {yellow}
      }-1}{n_{\mathrm {blue} }-n_{\mathrm {red} }}}.]
For a more accurate description of the wavelength dependence of the refractive
index, the Sellmeier_equation can be used.[28] It is an empirical formula that
works well in describing dispersion. Sellmeier coefficients are often quoted
instead of the refractive index in tables.
Because of dispersion, it is usually important to specify the vacuum wavelength
of light for which a refractive index is measured. Typically, measurements are
done at various well-defined spectral emission_lines; for example, nD usually
denotes the refractive index at the Fraunhofer "D" line, the centre of the
yellow sodium double emission at 589.29 nm wavelength.[15]
***** Complex refractive index[edit] *****
[A_glass_plate,_half_of_which_is_darkened]
A graduated_neutral_density_filter showing light absorption in the upper half
See also: Mathematical_descriptions_of_opacity
When light passes through a medium, some part of it will always be attenuated.
This can be conveniently taken into account by defining a complex refractive
index,
           n &#x005F;   = n + i &#x03BA; .   {\displaystyle {\underline
      {n}}=n+i\kappa .}  [{\underline {n}}=n+i\kappa .]
Here, the real part n is the refractive index and indicates the phase_velocity,
while the imaginary part Îº is called the extinction coefficient â although
Îº can also refer to the mass_attenuation_coefficientâ[29]:3 and indicates
the amount of attenuation when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the
material.[1]:128
That Îº corresponds to attenuation can be seen by inserting this refractive
index into the expression for electric_field of a plane electromagnetic wave
traveling in the z-direction. We can do this by relating the complex wave
number k to the complex refractive index n through k = 2Ïn/Î»0, with Î»0 being
the vacuum wavelength; this can be inserted into the plane wave expression as
          E  ( z , t ) = Re   [    E   0    e  i (   k &#x005F;   z &#x2212;
      &#x03C9; t )    ]  = Re   [    E   0    e  i ( 2 &#x03C0; ( n + i
      &#x03BA; ) z  /   &#x03BB;  0   &#x2212; &#x03C9; t )    ]  =  e
      &#x2212; 2 &#x03C0; &#x03BA; z  /   &#x03BB;  0     Re   [    E   0    e
      i ( k z &#x2212; &#x03C9; t )    ]  .   {\displaystyle \mathbf {E}
      (z,t)=\operatorname {Re} \!\left[\mathbf {E} _{0}e^{i({\underline {k}}z-
      \omega t)}\right]=\operatorname {Re} \!\left[\mathbf {E} _{0}e^{i(2\pi
      (n+i\kappa )z/\lambda _{0}-\omega t)}\right]=e^{-2\pi \kappa z/\lambda _
      {0}}\operatorname {Re} \!\left[\mathbf {E} _{0}e^{i(kz-\omega
      t)}\right].}  [\mathbf {E} (z,t)=\operatorname {Re} \!\left[\mathbf {E} _
      {0}e^{i({\underline {k}}z-\omega t)}\right]=\operatorname {Re} \!\left
      [\mathbf {E} _{0}e^{i(2\pi (n+i\kappa )z/\lambda _{0}-\omega
      t)}\right]=e^{-2\pi \kappa z/\lambda _{0}}\operatorname {Re} \!\left
      [\mathbf {E} _{0}e^{i(kz-\omega t)}\right].]
Here we see that Îº gives an exponential decay, as expected from the
BeerâLambert_law. Since intensity is proportional to the square of the
electric field, it will depend on the depth into the material as exp(â4ÏÎºz/
Î»0), and the attenuation_coefficient becomes Î± = 4ÏÎº/Î»0.[1]:128 This also
relates it to the penetration_depth, the distance after which the intensity is
reduced by 1/e, Î´p = 1/Î± = Î»0/(4ÏÎº).
Both n and Îº are dependent on the frequency. In most circumstances Îº > 0
(light is absorbed) or Îº = 0 (light travels forever without loss). In special
situations, especially in the gain_medium of lasers, it is also possible that
Îº < 0, corresponding to an amplification of the light.
An alternative convention uses n = n â iÎº instead of n = n + iÎº, but where
Îº > 0 still corresponds to loss. Therefore, these two conventions are
inconsistent and should not be confused. The difference is related to defining
sinusoidal time dependence as Re[exp(âiÏt)] versus Re[exp(+iÏt)]. See
Mathematical_descriptions_of_opacity.
Dielectric loss and non-zero DC conductivity in materials cause absorption.
Good dielectric materials such as glass have extremely low DC conductivity, and
at low frequencies the dielectric loss is also negligible, resulting in almost
no absorption. However, at higher frequencies (such as visible light),
dielectric loss may increase absorption significantly, reducing the material's
transparency to these frequencies.
The real, n, and imaginary, Îº, parts of the complex refractive index are
related through the KramersâKronig_relations. In 1986 A.R. Forouhi and I.
Bloomer deduced an equation describing Îº as a function of photon energy, E,
applicable to amorphous materials. Forouhi and Bloomer then applied the
KramersâKronig relation to derive the corresponding equation for n_as_a
function_of_E. The same formalism was applied to crystalline materials by
Forouhi and Bloomer in 1988.
The refractive index and extinction coefficient, n and Îº, cannot be measured
directly. They must be determined indirectly from measurable quantities that
depend on them, such as reflectance,_R,_or_transmittance,_T, or ellipsometric
parameters, Ï_and_Î´. The determination of n and Îº from such measured
quantities will involve developing a theoretical expression for R or T, or Ï
and Î´ in terms of a valid physical model for n and Îº. By fitting the
theoretical model to the measured R or T, or Ï and Î´ using regression
analysis, n and Îº can be deduced.
For X-ray and extreme_ultraviolet radiation the complex refractive index
deviates only slightly from unity and usually has a real part smaller than 1.
It is therefore normally written as n = 1 â Î´ + iÎ² (or n = 1 â Î´ â iÎ²
with the alternative convention mentioned above).[2] Far above the atomic
resonance frequency delta can be given by
         &#x03B4; =     r  0    &#x03BB;  2    n  e     2 &#x03C0;
      {\displaystyle \delta ={\frac {r_{0}\lambda ^{2}n_{e}}{2\pi }}}  [
      {\displaystyle \delta ={\frac {r_{0}\lambda ^{2}n_{e}}{2\pi }}}]
where      r  0     {\displaystyle r_{0}}  [r_{0}] is the classical_electron
radius,     &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ] is the X-ray
wavelength, and      n  e     {\displaystyle n_{e}}  [n_{e}] is the electron
density. One may assume the electron density is simply the number of electrons
per atom Z multiplied by the atomic density, but more accurate calculation of
the refractive index requires replacing Z with the complex atomic_form_factor
f = Z +  f &#x2032;  + i  f &#x2033;    {\displaystyle f=Z+f'+if''}  [
{\displaystyle f=Z+f'+if''}]. It follows that
         &#x03B4; =     r  0    &#x03BB;  2     2 &#x03C0;    ( Z +  f &#x2032;
      )  n  A t o m     {\displaystyle \delta ={\frac {r_{0}\lambda ^{2}}{2\pi

         &#x03B2; =     r  0    &#x03BB;  2     2 &#x03C0;     f &#x2033;   n

with     &#x03B4;   {\displaystyle \delta }  [\delta ] and     &#x03B2;
{\displaystyle \beta }  [\beta ] typically of the order of 10â5 and 10â6.
***** Relations to other quantities[edit] *****
**** Optical path length[edit] ****
[Soap_bubble]
The colors of a soap_bubble are determined by the optical_path_length through
the thin soap film in a phenomenon called thin-film_interference.
Optical_path_length (OPL) is the product of the geometric length d of the path
light follows through a system, and the index of refraction of the medium
through which it propagates,[30]
          OPL  = n d .   {\displaystyle {\text{OPL}}=nd.}  [{\text{OPL}}=nd.]
This is an important concept in optics because it determines the phase of the
light and governs interference and diffraction of light as it propagates.
According to Fermat's_principle, light rays can be characterized as those
curves that optimize the optical path length.[1]:68â69
**** Refraction[edit] ****
Main article: Refraction
[refer_to_caption]
Refraction of light at the interface between two media of different refractive
indices, with n2 > n1. Since the phase_velocity is lower in the second medium
(v2 < v1), the angle of refraction Î¸2 is less than the angle of incidence Î¸1;
that is, the ray in the higher-index medium is closer to the normal.
When light moves from one medium to another, it changes direction, i.e. it is
refracted. If it moves from a medium with refractive index n1 to one with
refractive index n2, with an incidence_angle to the surface_normal of Î¸1, the
refraction angle Î¸2 can be calculated from Snell's_law:[31]
          n  1   sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1   =  n  2   sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;
      2   .   {\displaystyle n_{1}\sin \theta _{1}=n_{2}\sin \theta _{2}.}  [n_
      {1}\sin \theta _{1}=n_{2}\sin \theta _{2}.]
When light enters a material with higher refractive index, the angle of
refraction will be smaller than the angle of incidence and the light will be
refracted towards the normal of the surface. The higher the refractive index,
the closer to the normal direction the light will travel. When passing into a
medium with lower refractive index, the light will instead be refracted away
from the normal, towards the surface.
**** Total internal reflection[edit] ****
Main article: Total_internal_reflection
[A_sea_turtle_being_reflected_in_the_water_surface_above]
Total_internal_reflection can be seen at the air-water boundary.
If there is no angle Î¸2 fulfilling Snell's law, i.e.,
            n  1    n  2     sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1   > 1 ,   {\displaystyle
      {\frac {n_{1}}{n_{2}}}\sin \theta _{1}>1,}  [{\frac {n_{1}}{n_{2}}}\sin
      \theta _{1}>1,]
the light cannot be transmitted and will instead undergo total_internal
reflection.[32]:49â50 This occurs only when going to a less optically dense
material, i.e., one with lower refractive index. To get total internal
reflection the angles of incidence Î¸1 must be larger than the critical angle
[33]
          &#x03B8;   c    = arcsin   (    n  2    n  1     )   .
      {\displaystyle \theta _{\mathrm {c} }=\arcsin \!\left({\frac {n_{2}}{n_
      {1}}}\right)\!.}  [\theta _{\mathrm {c} }=\arcsin \!\left({\frac {n_{2}}
      {n_{1}}}\right)\!.]
**** Reflectivity[edit] ****
Apart from the transmitted light there is also a reflected part. The reflection
angle is equal to the incidence angle, and the amount of light that is
reflected is determined by the reflectivity of the surface. The reflectivity
can be calculated from the refractive index and the incidence angle with the
Fresnel_equations, which for normal_incidence reduces to[32]:44
          R  0   =   |     n  1   &#x2212;  n  2      n  1   +  n  2      |   2
      .   {\displaystyle R_{0}=\left|{\frac {n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}}\right|^
      {2}\!.}  [R_{0}=\left|{\frac {n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}}\right|^{2}\!.]
For common glass in air, n1 = 1 and n2 = 1.5, and thus about 4% of the incident
power is reflected.[34] At other incidence angles the reflectivity will also
depend on the polarization of the incoming light. At a certain angle called
Brewster's_angle, p-polarized light (light with the electric field in the plane
of_incidence) will be totally transmitted. Brewster's angle can be calculated
from the two refractive indices of the interface as [1]:245
          &#x03B8;   B    = arctan   (    n  2    n  1     )   .
      {\displaystyle \theta _{\mathrm {B} }=\arctan \!\left({\frac {n_{2}}{n_
      {1}}}\right)\!.}  [\theta _{\mathrm {B} }=\arctan \!\left({\frac {n_{2}}
      {n_{1}}}\right)\!.]
**** Lenses[edit] ****
[A_magnifying_glass]
The power of a magnifying_glass is determined by the shape and refractive index
of the lens.
The focal_length of a lens is determined by its refractive index n and the
radii_of_curvature R1 and R2 of its surfaces. The power of a thin_lens in air
is given by the Lensmaker's_formula:[35]
           1 f   = ( n &#x2212; 1 )   (    1  R  1     &#x2212;   1  R  2
      )   ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{f}}=(n-1)\!\left({\frac {1}{R_{1}}}-
      {\frac {1}{R_{2}}}\right)\!,}  [{\frac {1}{f}}=(n-1)\!\left({\frac {1}{R_
      {1}}}-{\frac {1}{R_{2}}}\right)\!,]
where f is the focal length of the lens.
**** Microscope resolution[edit] ****
The resolution of a good optical microscope is mainly determined by the
numerical_aperture (NA) of its objective_lens. The numerical aperture in turn
is determined by the refractive index n of the medium filling the space between
the sample and the lens and the half collection angle of light Î¸ according to
[36]:6
          N A  = n sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; .   {\displaystyle \mathrm {NA} =n\sin
      \theta .}  [\mathrm {NA} =n\sin \theta .]
For this reason oil_immersion is commonly used to obtain high resolution in
microscopy. In this technique the objective is dipped into a drop of high
refractive index immersion oil on the sample under study.[36]:14
**** Relative permittivity and permeability[edit] ****
The refractive index of electromagnetic radiation equals
         n =    &#x03B5;   r     &#x03BC;   r      ,   {\displaystyle n={\sqrt
      {\varepsilon _{\mathrm {r} }\mu _{\mathrm {r} }}},}  [n={\sqrt
      {\varepsilon _{\mathrm {r} }\mu _{\mathrm {r} }}},]
where Îµr is the material's relative_permittivity, and Î¼r is its relative
permeability.[37]:229 The refractive index is used for optics in Fresnel
equations and Snell's_law; while the relative permittivity and permeability are
used in Maxwell's_equations and electronics. Most naturally occurring materials
are non-magnetic at optical frequencies, that is Î¼r is very close to 1,
[citation_needed] therefore n is approximately √Îµr. In this particular case,
the complex relative permittivity Îµr, with real and imaginary parts Îµr and
ÉÌr, and the complex refractive index n, with real and imaginary parts n and
Îº (the latter called the "extinction coefficient"), follow the relation

is the complex_modulus.
**** Wave impedance[edit] ****
See also: Wave_impedance
The wave impedance of a plane electromagnetic wave in a non-conductive medium
is given by
         Z =    &#x03BC; &#x03B5;    =      &#x03BC;   0     &#x03BC;   r
      &#x03B5;   0     &#x03B5;   r        =     &#x03BC;   0     &#x03B5;   0

      {\mu _{\mathrm {r} }}{\varepsilon _{\mathrm {r} }}}}=Z_{0}{\frac {\mu _
      {\mathrm {r} }}{n}}}]
where      Z  0     {\displaystyle Z_{0}}  [Z_{0}] is the vacuum wave
impedance, Î¼ and Ïµ are the absolute permeability and permittivity of the
medium, Îµr is the material's relative_permittivity, and Î¼r is its relative
permeability.
In non-magnetic media with      &#x03BC;   r    = 1   {\displaystyle \mu _
{\mathrm {r} }=1}  [{\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {r} }=1}],
         Z =    Z  0   n   ,   {\displaystyle Z={\frac {Z_{0}}{n}},}  [
      {\displaystyle Z={\frac {Z_{0}}{n}},}]
         n =    Z  0   Z   .   {\displaystyle n={\frac {Z_{0}}{Z}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle n={\frac {Z_{0}}{Z}}.}]
Thus refractive index in a non-magnetic media is the ratio of the vacuum wave
impedance to the wave impedance of the medium.
The reflectivity      R  0     {\displaystyle R_{0}}  [R_{0}] between two media
can thus be expressed both by the wave impedances and the refractive indices as
          R  0   =   |     n  1   &#x2212;  n  2      n  1   +  n  2      |   2

**** Density[edit] ****
[A_scatter_plot_showing_a_strong_correlation_between_glass_density_and
refractive_index_for_different_glasses]
Relation between the refractive index and the density of silicate and
borosilicate_glasses[39]
In general, the refractive index of a glass increases with its density.
However, there does not exist an overall linear relation between the refractive
index and the density for all silicate and borosilicate glasses. A relatively
high refractive index and low density can be obtained with glasses containing
light metal oxides such as Li2O and MgO, while the opposite trend is observed
with glasses containing PbO and BaO as seen in the diagram at the right.
Many oils (such as olive_oil) and ethyl_alcohol are examples of liquids which
are more refractive, but less dense, than water, contrary to the general
correlation between density and refractive index.
For air, n â 1 is proportional to the density of the gas as long as the
chemical composition does not change.[40] This means that it is also
proportional to the pressure and inversely proportional to the temperature for
ideal_gases.
**** Group index[edit] ****
Sometimes, a "group velocity refractive index", usually called the group index
is defined:[citation_needed]
          n   g    =    c   v   g      ,   {\displaystyle n_{\mathrm {g} }=
      {\frac {\mathrm {c} }{v_{\mathrm {g} }}},}  [n_{\mathrm {g} }={\frac
      {\mathrm {c} }{v_{\mathrm {g} }}},]
where vg is the group_velocity. This value should not be confused with n, which
is always defined with respect to the phase_velocity. When the dispersion is
small, the group velocity can be linked to the phase velocity by the relation
[32]:22
          v   g    = v &#x2212; &#x03BB;     d  v    d  &#x03BB;    ,
      {\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {g} }=v-\lambda {\frac {\mathrm {d} v}{\mathrm
      {d} \lambda }},}  [v_{\mathrm {g} }=v-\lambda {\frac {\mathrm {d} v}
      {\mathrm {d} \lambda }},]
where Î» is the wavelength in the medium. In this case the group index can thus
be written in terms of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index as
          n   g    =   n  1 +   &#x03BB; n       d  n    d  &#x03BB;       .
      {\displaystyle n_{\mathrm {g} }={\frac {n}{1+{\frac {\lambda }{n}}{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} n}{\mathrm {d} \lambda }}}}.}  [n_{\mathrm {g} }={\frac {n}
      {1+{\frac {\lambda }{n}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} n}{\mathrm {d} \lambda }}}}.]
When the refractive index of a medium is known as a function of the vacuum
wavelength (instead of the wavelength in the medium), the corresponding
expressions for the group velocity and index are (for all values of dispersion)
[41]
          v   g    =  c     (  n &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  0       d  n    d
      &#x03BB;  0       )   &#x2212; 1    ,   {\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {g}
      }=\mathrm {c} \!\left(n-\lambda _{0}{\frac {\mathrm {d} n}{\mathrm {d}
      \lambda _{0}}}\right)^{-1}\!,}  [v_{\mathrm {g} }=\mathrm {c} \!\left(n-
      \lambda _{0}{\frac {\mathrm {d} n}{\mathrm {d} \lambda _{0}}}\right)^{-
      1}\!,]
          n   g    = n &#x2212;  &#x03BB;  0       d  n    d   &#x03BB;  0
      ,   {\displaystyle n_{\mathrm {g} }=n-\lambda _{0}{\frac {\mathrm {d} n}
      {\mathrm {d} \lambda _{0}}},}  [n_{\mathrm {g} }=n-\lambda _{0}{\frac
      {\mathrm {d} n}{\mathrm {d} \lambda _{0}}},]
where Î»0 is the wavelength in vacuum.
**** Momentum (AbrahamâMinkowski controversy)[edit] ****
Main article: AbrahamâMinkowski_controversy
In 1908, Hermann_Minkowski calculated the momentum p of a refracted ray as
follows:[42]
         p =    n E   c    ,   {\displaystyle p={\frac {nE}{\mathrm {c} }},}
      [p={\frac {nE}{\mathrm {c} }},]
where E is the energy of the photon, c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is
the refractive index of the medium. In 1909, Max_Abraham proposed the following
formula for this calculation:[43]
         p =   E  n  c     .   {\displaystyle p={\frac {E}{n\mathrm {c} }}.}
      [p={\frac {E}{n\mathrm {c} }}.]
A 2010 study suggested that both equations are correct, with the Abraham
version being the kinetic_momentum and the Minkowski version being the
canonical_momentum, and claims to explain the contradicting experimental
results using this interpretation.[44]
**** Other relations[edit] ****
As shown in the Fizeau_experiment, when light is transmitted through a moving
medium, its speed relative to an observer traveling with speed v in the same
direction as the light is:
         V =    c  n   +    v  (  1 &#x2212;   1  n  2      )    1 +   v  c n
      &#x2248;    c  n   + v  (  1 &#x2212;   1  n  2      )  &#xA0; .
      {\displaystyle V={\frac {\mathrm {c} }{n}}+{\frac {v\left(1-{\frac {1}{n^
      {2}}}\right)}{1+{\frac {v}{cn}}}}\approx {\frac {\mathrm {c} }{n}}+v\left
      (1-{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\right)\ .}  [{\displaystyle V={\frac {\mathrm {c} }
      {n}}+{\frac {v\left(1-{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\right)}{1+{\frac {v}
      {cn}}}}\approx {\frac {\mathrm {c} }{n}}+v\left(1-{\frac {1}{n^
      {2}}}\right)\ .}]
The refractive index of a substance can be related to its polarizability with
the LorentzâLorenz_equation or to the molar_refractivities of its
constituents by the GladstoneâDale_relation.
**** Refractivity[edit] ****
In atmospheric applications, the refractivity is taken as N = n â 1.
Atmospheric refractivity is often expressed as either[45] N = 106(n â 1)[46]
[47] or N = 108(n â 1)[48] The multiplication factors are used because the
refractive index for air, n deviates from unity by at most a few parts per ten
thousand.
Molar_refractivity, on the other hand, is a measure of the total polarizability
of a mole of a substance and can be calculated from the refractive index as
         A =   M &#x03C1;       n  2   &#x2212; 1    n  2   + 2    ,
      {\displaystyle A={\frac {M}{\rho }}{\frac {n^{2}-1}{n^{2}+2}},}  [A=
      {\frac {M}{\rho }}{\frac {n^{2}-1}{n^{2}+2}},]
where Ï is the density, and M is the molar_mass.[32]:93
***** Nonscalar, nonlinear, or nonhomogeneous refraction[edit] *****
So far, we have assumed that refraction is given by linear equations involving
a spatially constant, scalar refractive index. These assumptions can break down
in different ways, to be described in the following subsections.
**** Birefringence[edit] ****
Main article: Birefringence
[A_crystal_giving_a_double_image_of_the_text_behind_it]
A calcite crystal laid upon a paper with some letters showing double_refraction
[A_transparent_plastic_protractor_with_smoothly_varying_bright_colors]
Birefringent materials can give rise to colors when placed between crossed
polarizers. This is the basis for photoelasticity.
In some materials the refractive index depends on the polarization and
propagation direction of the light.[49] This is called birefringence or optical
anisotropy.
In the simplest form, uniaxial birefringence, there is only one special
direction in the material. This axis is known as the optical_axis of the
material.[1]:230 Light with linear polarization perpendicular to this axis will
experience an ordinary refractive index no while light polarized in parallel
will experience an extraordinary refractive index ne.[1]:236 The birefringence
of the material is the difference between these indices of refraction, În = ne
â no.[1]:237 Light propagating in the direction of the optical axis will not
be affected by the birefringence since the refractive index will be no
independent of polarization. For other propagation directions the light will
split into two linearly polarized beams. For light traveling perpendicularly to
the optical axis the beams will have the same direction.[1]:233 This can be
used to change the polarization direction of linearly polarized light or to
convert between linear, circular and elliptical polarizations with waveplates.
[1]:237
Many crystals are naturally birefringent, but isotropic materials such as
plastics and glass can also often be made birefringent by introducing a
preferred direction through, e.g., an external force or electric field. This
effect is called photoelasticity, and can be used to reveal stresses in
structures. The birefringent material is placed between crossed polarizers. A
change in birefringence alters the polarization and thereby the fraction of
light that is transmitted through the second polarizer.
In the more general case of trirefringent materials described by the field of
crystal_optics, the dielectric constant is a rank-2 tensor (a 3 by 3 matrix).
In this case the propagation of light cannot simply be described by refractive
indices except for polarizations along principal axes.
**** Nonlinearity[edit] ****
Main article: Nonlinear_optics
The strong electric_field of high intensity light (such as output of a laser)
may cause a medium's refractive index to vary as the light passes through it,
giving rise to nonlinear_optics.[1]:502 If the index varies quadratically with
the field (linearly with the intensity), it is called the optical_Kerr_effect
and causes phenomena such as self-focusing and self-phase_modulation.[1]:264 If
the index varies linearly with the field (a nontrivial linear coefficient is
only possible in materials that do not possess inversion_symmetry), it is known
as the Pockels_effect.[1]:265
**** Inhomogeneity[edit] ****
[Illustration_with_gradually_bending_rays_of_light_in_a_thick_slab_of_glass]
A gradient-index lens with a parabolic variation of refractive index (n) with
radial distance (x). The lens focuses light in the same way as a conventional
lens.
If the refractive index of a medium is not constant, but varies gradually with
position, the material is known as a gradient-index or GRIN medium and is
described by gradient_index_optics.[1]:273 Light traveling through such a
medium can be bent or focused, and this effect can be exploited to produce
lenses, some optical_fibers and other devices. Introducing GRIN elements in the
design of an optical system can greatly simplify the system, reducing the
number of elements by as much as a third while maintaining overall performance.
[1]:276 The crystalline lens of the human eye is an example of a GRIN lens with
a refractive index varying from about 1.406 in the inner core to approximately
1.386 at the less dense cortex.[1]:203 Some common mirages are caused by a
spatially varying refractive index of air.

The principle of many refractometers
The refractive index of liquids or solids can be measured with refractometers.
They typically measure some angle of refraction or the critical angle for total
internal reflection. The first laboratory_refractometers sold commercially were
developed by Ernst_Abbe in the late 19th century.[50] The same principles are
still used today. In this instrument a thin layer of the liquid to be measured
is placed between two prisms. Light is shone through the liquid at incidence
angles all the way up to 90Â°, i.e., light rays parallel to the surface. The
second prism should have an index of refraction higher than that of the liquid,
so that light only enters the prism at angles smaller than the critical angle
for total reflection. This angle can then be measured either by looking through
a telescope,[clarification_needed] or with a digital photodetector placed in
the focal plane of a lens. The refractive index n of the liquid can then be
calculated from the maximum transmission angle Î¸ as n = nG sin Î¸, where nG is
the refractive index of the prism.[51]

This type of devices are commonly used in chemical laboratories for
identification of substances and for quality_control. Handheld_variants are
used in agriculture by, e.g., wine_makers to determine sugar_content in grape
juice, and inline_process_refractometers are used in, e.g., chemical and
pharmaceutical_industry for process_control.
In gemology a different type of refractometer is used to measure index of
refraction and birefringence of gemstones. The gem is placed on a high
refractive index prism and illuminated from below. A high refractive index
contact liquid is used to achieve optical contact between the gem and the
prism. At small incidence angles most of the light will be transmitted into the
gem, but at high angles total internal reflection will occur in the prism. The
critical angle is normally measured by looking through a telescope.[52]

A differential interference contrast microscopy image of yeast cells
Unstained biological structures appear mostly transparent under Bright-field
microscopy as most cellular structures do not attenuate appreciable quantities
of light. Nevertheless, the variation in the materials that constitutes these
structures also corresponds to a variation in the refractive index. The
following techniques convert such variation into measurable amplitude
differences:
To measure the spatial variation of refractive index in a sample phase-contrast
imaging methods are used. These methods measure the variations in phase of the
light wave exiting the sample. The phase is proportional to the optical_path
length the light ray has traversed, and thus gives a measure of the integral of
the refractive index along the ray path. The phase cannot be measured directly
at optical or higher frequencies, and therefore needs to be converted into
intensity by interference with a reference beam. In the visual spectrum this is
done using Zernike phase-contrast_microscopy, differential_interference
contrast_microscopy (DIC) or interferometry.
Zernike phase-contrast microscopy introduces a phase shift to the low spatial
frequency components of the image with a phase-shifting annulus in the Fourier
plane of the sample, so that high-spatial-frequency parts of the image can
interfere with the low-frequency reference beam. In DIC the illumination is
split up into two beams that are given different polarizations, are phase
shifted differently, and are shifted transversely with slightly different
amounts. After the specimen, the two parts are made to interfere, giving an
image of the derivative of the optical path length in the direction of the
difference in transverse shift.[36] In interferometry the illumination is split
up into two beams by a partially_reflective_mirror. One of the beams is let
through the sample before they are combined to interfere and give a direct
image of the phase shifts. If the optical path length variations are more than
a wavelength the image will contain fringes.
There exist several phase-contrast_X-ray_imaging techniques to determine 2D or
3D spatial distribution of refractive index of samples in the X-ray regime.[53]

The refractive index is a very important property of the components of any
optical_instrument. It determines the focusing power of lenses, the dispersive
power of prisms, the reflectivity of lens_coatings, and the light-guiding
nature of optical_fiber. Since refractive index is a fundamental physical
property of a substance, it is often used to identify a particular substance,
confirm its purity, or measure its concentration. Refractive index is used to
measure solids, liquids, and gases. Most commonly it is used to measure the
concentration of a solute in an aqueous solution. It can also be used as a
useful tool to differentiate between different types of gemstone, due to the
unique chatoyance each individual stone displays. A refractometer is the
instrument used to measure refractive index. For a solution of sugar, the
refractive index can be used to determine the sugar content (see Brix).

      part of n being less than unity is that it implies that the phase
      velocity inside the material, c/n, is larger than the velocity of light,
      c. This does not, however, violate the law of relativity, which requires
      that only signals carrying information do not travel faster than c. Such
      signals move with the group velocity, not with the phase velocity, and it
      can be shown that the group velocity is in fact less than c.
