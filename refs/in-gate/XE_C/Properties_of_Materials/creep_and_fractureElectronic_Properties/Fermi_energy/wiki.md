****** Fermi energy ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The Fermi energy is a concept in quantum_mechanics usually referring to the
energy difference between the highest and lowest occupied single-particle
states in a quantum system of non-interacting fermions at absolute_zero
temperature. In a Fermi_gas, the lowest occupied state is taken to have zero
kinetic energy, whereas in a metal, the lowest occupied state is typically
taken to mean the bottom of the conduction_band.
The term "Fermi energy" is often used to refer to a different yet closely
related concept, the Fermi_level (also called electrochemical_potential).[note
1] There are a few key differences between the Fermi level and Fermi energy, at
least as they are used in this article:
    * The Fermi energy is only defined at absolute zero, while the Fermi level
      is defined for any temperature.
    * The Fermi energy is an energy difference (usually corresponding to a
      kinetic_energy), whereas the Fermi level is a total energy level
      including kinetic energy and potential energy.
    * The Fermi energy can only be defined for non-interacting_fermions (where
      the potential energy or band edge is a static, well defined quantity),
      whereas the Fermi level remains well defined even in complex interacting
      systems, at thermodynamic equilibrium.
Since the Fermi level in a metal at absolute zero is the energy of the highest
occupied single particle state, then the Fermi energy in a metal is the energy
difference between the Fermi level and lowest occupied single-particle state,
at zero-temperature.

***** Context[edit] *****
Main article: Fermi_gas
In quantum_mechanics, a group of particles known as fermions (for example,
electrons, protons and neutrons) obey the Pauli_exclusion_principle. This
states that two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum_state. Since an
idealized non-interacting Fermi gas can be analyzed in terms of single-particle
stationary_states, we can thus say that two fermions cannot occupy the same
stationary state. These stationary states will typically be distinct in energy.
To find the ground state of the whole system, we start with an empty system,
and add particles one at a time, consecutively filling up the unoccupied
stationary states with the lowest energy. When all the particles have been put
in, the Fermi energy is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state.
As a consequence, even if we have extracted all possible energy from a Fermi
gas by cooling it to near absolute_zero temperature, the fermions are still
moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity
corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This speed is
known as the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the related
Fermi temperature, do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at
absolute zero.
The Fermi energy is an important concept in the solid_state_physics of metals
and superconductors. It is also a very important quantity in the physics of
quantum_liquids like low temperature helium (both normal and superfluid 3He),
and it is quite important to nuclear_physics and to understanding the stability
of white_dwarf_stars against gravitational_collapse.
***** Formula and typical values[edit] *****
The Fermi energy for a non-interacting ensemble of identical spin-Â½ fermions
in a three-dimensional (non-relativistic) system is given by:
          E   F    =    &#x210F;  2    2  m  0        (    3  &#x03C0;  2   N
      V   )   2  /  3     {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {F} }={\frac {\hbar ^{2}}
      {2m_{0}}}\left({\frac {3\pi ^{2}N}{V}}\right)^{2/3}}  [{\displaystyle E_
      {\mathrm {F} }={\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m_{0}}}\left({\frac {3\pi ^{2}N}
      {V}}\right)^{2/3}}] ,[1][2]
where N is the number of particles, m0 the rest_mass of each fermion, V the
volume of the system and     &#x210F;   {\displaystyle \hbar }  [\hbar ] the
reduced Planck_constant.
**** Metals[edit] ****
Under the free_electron_model, the electrons in a metal can be considered to
form a Fermi gas. The number density     N  /  V   {\displaystyle N/V}  [N/V]
of conduction electrons in metals ranges between approximately 1028 and 1029
electrons/m3, which is also the typical density of atoms in ordinary solid
matter. This number density produces a Fermi energy of the order of 2 to 10
electronvolts.[3]
**** White dwarfs[edit] ****
Stars known as white_dwarfs have mass comparable to our Sun, but have about a
hundredth of its radius. The high densities mean that the electrons are no
longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas. Their
Fermi energy is about 0.3 MeV.
**** Nucleus[edit] ****
Another typical example is that of the nucleons in the nucleus of an atom. The
radius_of_the_nucleus admits deviations, so a typical value for the Fermi
energy is usually given as 38 MeV.
***** Related quantities[edit] *****
Using this definition of above for the Fermi energy, various related quantities
can be useful.
The Fermi temperature is defined as:
          T   F    =    E   F     k   B        {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {F} }=
      {\frac {E_{\mathrm {F} }}{k_{\rm {B}}}}}  [{\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {F}
      }={\frac {E_{\mathrm {F} }}{k_{\rm {B}}}}}]
where      k   B      {\displaystyle k_{\rm {B}}}  [k_{\rm B}] is the Boltzmann
constant and      E   F      {\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {F} }}  [{\displaystyle
E_{\mathrm {F} }}] the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as
the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects
associated with Fermi statistics.[4] The Fermi temperature for a metal is a
couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature.
Other quantities defined in this context are Fermi momentum
          p   F    =   2  m  0    E   F        {\displaystyle p_{\mathrm {F} }=
      {\sqrt {2m_{0}E_{\mathrm {F} }}}}  [{\displaystyle p_{\mathrm {F} }=
      {\sqrt {2m_{0}E_{\mathrm {F} }}}}],
and Fermi velocity
          v   F    =    p   F     m  0       {\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {F} }=
      {\frac {p_{\mathrm {F} }}{m_{0}}}}  [{\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {F} }=
      {\frac {p_{\mathrm {F} }}{m_{0}}}}].
These quantities are the momentum and group_velocity, respectively, of a
fermion at the Fermi_surface.
The Fermi momentum can also be described as
         p   F    = &#x210F;  k   F      {\displaystyle p_{\mathrm {F}
     }=\hbar k_{\mathrm {F} }}  [{\displaystyle p_{\mathrm {F} }=\hbar k_
     {\mathrm {F} }}],
where      k   F      {\displaystyle k_{\mathrm {F} }}  [{\displaystyle k_
{\mathrm {F} }}] is the radius of the Fermi sphere and is called the Fermi
wavevector.[5]
These quantities are not well-defined in cases where the Fermi_surface is non-
spherical.

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ The use of the term "Fermi energy" as synonymous with Fermi_level
      (a.k.a. electrochemical_potential) is widespread in semiconductor
      physics. For example: Electronics_(fundamentals_And_Applications) by D.
      Chattopadhyay, Semiconductor_Physics_and_Applications by Balkanski and
      Wallis.
