***** Summary *****
                                  English: Thermal transitions in (A)
                                  amorphous and (B) semicrystalline
                                  polymers, represented as traces from
                                  differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
                                  Heat flow (exotherm down) is on the y-
                                  axis, and temperature is on the x-axis. As
                                  the temperature increases, both amorphous
DescriptionThermal transitions in and semicrystalline polymers go through
amorphous and semicrystalline     the glass transition (Tg). As the
polymers.tif                      temperature continues to increase,
                                  amorphous polymers (A) experience
                                  increasingly rapid molecular motions but
                                  do not exhibit other phase transitions.
                                  However, semicrystalline polymers (B)
                                  undergo crystallization and melting
                                  transitions (at temperatures Tc and Tm,
                                  respectively).
