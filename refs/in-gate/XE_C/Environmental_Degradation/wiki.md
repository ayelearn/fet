****** Environmental degradation ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Eighty-plus years after the abandonment of Wallaroo_Mines (Kadina,_South
Australia), mosses remain the only vegetation at some spots of the site's
grounds.
Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through
depletion_of_resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of
ecosystems; habitat_destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution. It
is defined as any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be
deleterious or undesirable.[1] As indicated by the I=PAT equation,
environmental impact (I) or degradation is caused by the combination of an
already very large and increasing human population (P), continually increasing
economic_growth or per capita affluence (A), and the application of resource-
depleting and polluting technology (T).[2][3]
Environmental degradation is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the
High-level_Panel_on_Threats,_Challenges_and_Change of the United_Nations. The
United_Nations_International_Strategy_for_Disaster_Reduction defines
environmental degradation as "the reduction of the capacity of the environment
to meet social and ecological objectives, and needs".[4] Environmental
degradation comes in many types. When natural_habitats_are_destroyed or natural
resources are depleted, the environment is degraded. Efforts to counteract this
problem include environmental_protection and environmental_resources
management.

***** Biodiversity loss[edit] *****
See also: Biodiversity_loss, Defaunation, and Holocene_extinction
Scientists assert that human activity has pushed the earth into a sixth_mass
extinction event.[5] The loss_of_biodiversity has been attributed in particular
to human_overpopulation, continued human population_growth and overconsumption
of natural resources by the world's wealthy.[6][7] The Global_Assessment_Report
on_Biodiversity_and_Ecosystem_Services published by IPBES in 2019 posits that
roughly one million species of plants and animals face extinction from
anthropogenic causes, such as expanding human land use for industrial
agriculture and livestock rearing, along with overfishing.[8][9][10]
***** Water degradation[edit] *****
One major component of environmental degradation is the depletion of the
resource of fresh water on Earth.[11] Approximately only 2.5% of all of the
water on Earth is fresh water, with the rest being salt water. 69% of fresh
water is frozen in ice_caps located on Antarctica and Greenland, so only 30% of
the 2.5% of fresh water is available for consumption.[12] Fresh water is an
exceptionally important resource, since life on Earth is ultimately dependent
on it. Water transports nutrients, minerals and chemicals within the biosphere
to all forms of life, sustains both plants and animals, and moulds the surface
of the Earth with transportation and deposition of materials.[13]
The current top three uses of fresh water account for 95% of its consumption;
approximately 85% is used for irrigation of farmland, golf courses, and parks,
6% is used for domestic purposes such as indoor bathing uses and outdoor garden
and lawn use, and 4% is used for industrial purposes such as processing,
washing, and cooling in manufacturing centres.[14] It is estimated that one in
three people over the entire globe are already facing water shortages, almost
one-fifth of the world_population live in areas of physical_water_scarcity, and
almost one quarter of the world's population live in a developing_country that
lacks the necessary infrastructure to use water from available rivers and
aquifers. Water scarcity is an increasing problem due to many foreseen issues
in the future including population growth, increased urbanization, higher
standards of living, and climate change.[12]
**** Climate change and temperature[edit] ****
Climate_change affects the Earth's water supply in a large number of ways. It
is predicted that the mean global temperature will rise in the coming years due
to a number of forces affecting the climate. The amount of atmospheric_carbon
dioxide_(CO2) will rise, and both of these will influence water resources;
evaporation depends strongly on temperature and moisture availability which can
ultimately affect the amount of water available to replenish groundwater
supplies.
Transpiration from plants can be affected by a rise in atmospheric CO2, which
can decrease their use of water, but can also raise their use of water from
possible increases of leaf area. Temperature rise can reduce the snow season in
the winter and increase the intensity of the melting snow leading to peak
runoff of this, affecting soil moisture, flood and drought risks, and storage
capacities depending on the area.[15]
Warmer winter temperatures cause a decrease in snowpack, which can result in
diminished water resources during summer. This is especially important at mid-
latitudes and in mountain regions that depend on glacial runoff to replenish
their river systems and groundwater supplies, making these areas increasingly
vulnerable to water shortages over time; an increase in temperature will
initially result in a rapid rise in water melting from glaciers in the summer,
followed by a retreat in glaciers and a decrease in the melt and consequently
the water supply every year as the size of these glaciers get smaller and
smaller.[12]
Thermal_expansion of water and increased melting of oceanic glaciers from an
increase in temperature gives way to a rise in sea level. This can affect the
fresh water supply to coastal areas as well. As river mouths and deltas with
higher salinity get pushed further inland, an intrusion of saltwater results in
an increase of salinity in reservoirs and aquifers.[14] Sea-level rise may also
consequently be caused by a depletion of groundwater,[16] as climate change can
affect the hydrologic_cycle in a number of ways. Uneven distributions of
increased temperatures and increased precipitation around the globe results in
water surpluses and deficits,[15] but a global decrease in groundwater suggests
a rise in sea level, even after meltwater and thermal expansion were accounted
for,[16] which can provide a positive_feedback to the problems sea-level rise
causes to fresh-water supply.
A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also
very significant in water degradation as the water would become more
susceptible to bacterial_growth. An increase in water temperature can also
affect ecosystems greatly because of a species' sensitivity to temperature, and
also by inducing changes in a body of water's self-purification system from
decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature.
[12]
**** Climate change and precipitation[edit] ****
A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase
in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased
rates of soil_erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water_quality is
probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more
contaminants.[12] While most of the attention about climate change is directed
towards global warming and greenhouse_effect, some of the most severe effects
of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation,
evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture. It is generally expected that,
on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving
increases and some decreases.
Climate_models show that while some regions should expect an increase in
precipitation,[15] such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are
expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics. This will ultimately
cause a latitudinal variation in water distribution.[12] The areas receiving
more precipitation are also expected to receive this increase during their
winter and actually become drier during their summer,[15] creating even more of
a variation of precipitation distribution. Naturally, the distribution of
precipitation across the planet is very uneven, causing constant variations in
water availability in respective locations.
Changes in precipitation affect the timing and magnitude of floods and
droughts, shift runoff processes, and alter groundwater recharge rates.
Vegetation patterns and growth rates will be directly affected by shifts in
precipitation amount and distribution, which will in turn affect agriculture as
well as natural ecosystems. Decreased precipitation will deprive areas of water
causing water tables to fall and reservoirs of wetlands, rivers, and lakes to
empty.[15] In addition, a possible increase in evaporation and
evapotranspiration will result, depending on the accompanied rise in
temperature.[14] Groundwater reserves will be depleted, and the remaining water
has a greater chance of being of poor quality from saline or contaminants on
the land surface.[12]
**** Population growth[edit] ****
World population growth in a lin-log_scale
See also: Human_overpopulation
The_human_population_on_Earth_is_expanding_rapidly which goes hand in hand with
the degradation of the environment at large measures. Humanity's appetite for
needs is disarranging the environment's natural equilibrium. Production
industries are venting smoke and discharging chemicals that are polluting water
resources. The smoke that is emitted into the atmosphere holds detrimental
gases such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide. The high levels of pollution
in the atmosphere form layers that are eventually absorbed into the atmosphere.
Organic compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCâs) have generated an
unwanted opening in the ozone layer, which emits higher levels of ultraviolet
radiation putting the globe at large threat.
The available fresh water being affected by the climate is also being stretched
across an ever-increasing global population. It is estimated that almost a
quarter of the global population is living in an area that is using more than
20% of their renewable water supply; water use will rise with population while
the water supply is also being aggravated by decreases in streamflow and
groundwater caused by climate change. Even though some areas may see an
increase in freshwater supply from an uneven distribution of precipitation
increase, an increased use of water supply is expected.[17]
An increased population means increased withdrawals from the water supply for
domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, the largest of these being
agriculture,[18] believed to be the major non-climate driver of environmental
change and water deterioration. The next 50 years will likely be the last
period of rapid agricultural_expansion, but the larger and wealthier population
over this time will demand more agriculture.[19]
Population increase over the last two decades, at least in the United States,
has also been accompanied by a shift to an increase in urban areas from rural
areas,[20] which concentrates the demand for water into certain areas, and puts
stress on the fresh water supply from industrial and human contaminants.[12]
Urbanization causes overcrowding and increasingly unsanitary living conditions,
especially in developing countries, which in turn exposes an increasingly
number of people to disease. About 79% of the world's population is in
developing countries, which lack access to sanitary water and sewer systems,
giving rises to disease and deaths from contaminated water and increased
numbers of disease-carrying insects.[21]
**** Agriculture[edit] ****

Agriculture is dependent on available soil moisture, which is directly affected
by climate dynamics, with precipitation being the input in this system and
various processes being the output, such as evapotranspiration, surface_runoff,
drainage, and percolation into groundwater. Changes in climate, especially the
changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration predicted by climate models,
will directly affect soil moisture, surface runoff, and groundwater recharge.
In areas with decreasing precipitation as predicted by the climate models, soil
moisture may be substantially reduced.[15] With this in mind, agriculture in
most areas already needs irrigation, which depletes fresh water supplies both
by the physical use of the water and the degradation agriculture causes to the
water. Irrigation increases salt and nutrient content in areas that would not
normally be affected, and damages streams and rivers from damming and removal
of water. Fertilizer enters both human and livestock waste streams that
eventually enter groundwater, while nitrogen, phosphorus, and other chemicals
from fertilizer can acidify both soils and water. Certain agricultural demands
may increase more than others with an increasingly wealthier global population,
and meat is one commodity expected to double global food demand by 2050,[19]
which directly affects the global supply of fresh water. Cows need water to
drink, more if the temperature is high and humidity is low, and more if the
production system the cow is in is extensive, since finding food takes more
effort. Water is needed in processing of the meat, and also in the production
of feed for the livestock. Manure can contaminate bodies of freshwater, and
slaughterhouses, depending on how well they are managed, contribute waste such
as blood, fat, hair, and other bodily contents to supplies of fresh water.[22]
The transfer of water from agricultural to urban and suburban use raises
concerns about agricultural sustainability, rural socioeconomic decline, food
security, an increased carbon_footprint from imported food, and decreased
foreign trade balance.[18] The depletion of fresh water, as applied to more
specific and populated areas, increases fresh water scarcity among the
population and also makes populations susceptible to economic, social, and
political conflict in a number of ways; rising sea levels forces migration from
coastal areas to other areas farther inland, pushing populations closer
together breaching borders and other geographical patterns, and agricultural
surpluses and deficits from the availability of water induce trade problems and
economies of certain areas.[17] Climate change is an important cause of
involuntary migration and forced displacement[23] According to the Food_and
Agriculture_Organization of the United Nations, global greenhouse gas emissions
from animal agriculture exceeds that of transportation.[24]
**** Water management[edit] ****

drainage from the former copper mine at nearby Parys_Mountain
The issue of the depletion of fresh water can be met by increased efforts in
water management.[13] While water management systems are often flexible,
adaptation to new hydrologic conditions may be very costly.[15] Preventative
approaches are necessary to avoid high costs of inefficiency and the need for
rehabilitation of water_supplies,[13] and innovations to decrease overall
demand may be important in planning water sustainability.[18]
Water supply systems, as they exist now, were based on the assumptions of the
current climate, and built to accommodate existing river flows and flood
frequencies. Reservoirs are operated based on past hydrologic records, and
irrigation systems on historical temperature, water availability, and crop
water requirements; these may not be a reliable guide to the future. Re-
examining engineering designs, operations, optimizations, and planning, as well
as re-evaluating legal, technical, and economic approaches to manage water
resources are very important for the future of water management in response to
water degradation. Another approach is water_privatization; despite its
economic and cultural effects, service quality and overall quality of the water
can be more easily controlled and distributed. Rationality and sustainability
is appropriate, and requires limits to overexploitation and pollution and
efforts in conservation.[13]
