Micrograph of a polycrystalline metal; grain boundaries evidenced by acid
etching.
Differently oriented crystallites in a polycrystalline material
A grain boundary is the interface between two grains, or crystallites, in a
polycrystalline material. Grain boundaries are 2D defects in the crystal
structure, and tend to decrease the electrical and thermal_conductivity of the
material. Most grain boundaries are preferred sites for the onset of corrosion
and for the precipitation of new phases from the solid. They are also important
to many of the mechanisms of creep. On the other hand, grain boundaries disrupt
the motion of dislocations through a material, so reducing crystallite size is
a common way to improve mechanical strength, as described by the HallâPetch
relationship. The study of grain boundaries and their effects on the
mechanical, electrical and other properties of materials forms an important
topic in materials_science.

It is convenient to categorize grain boundaries according to the extent of
misorientation between the two grains. Low-angle grain boundaries or subgrain
boundaries are those with a misorientation less than about 15 degrees.[1]
Generally speaking they are composed of an array of dislocations and their
properties and structure are a function of the misorientation. In contrast the
properties of high-angle grain boundaries, whose misorientation is greater than
about 15 degrees (the transition angle varies from 10â15 degrees depending on
the material), are normally found to be independent of the misorientation.
However, there are 'special boundaries' at particular orientations whose
interfacial energies are markedly lower than those of general high-angle grain
boundaries.
Schematic representations of a tilt boundary (top) and a twist boundary between
two idealised grains.
The simplest boundary is that of a tilt boundary where the rotation axis is
parallel to the boundary plane. This boundary can be conceived as forming from
a single, contiguous crystallite or grain which is gradually bent by some
external force. The energy associated with the elastic bending of the lattice
can be reduced by inserting a dislocation, which is essentially a half-plane of
atoms that act like a wedge, that creates a permanent misorientation between
the two sides. As the grain is bent further, more and more dislocations must be
introduced to accommodate the deformation resulting in a growing wall of
dislocations â a low-angle boundary. The grain can now be considered to have
split into two sub-grains of related crystallography but notably different
orientations.
An alternative is a twist boundary where the misorientation occurs around an
axis that is perpendicular to the boundary plane. This type of boundary
incorporates two sets of screw_dislocations. If the Burgers_vectors of the
dislocations are orthogonal, then the dislocations do not strongly interact and
form a square network. In other cases, the dislocations may interact to form a
more complex hexagonal structure.
These concepts of tilt and twist boundaries represent somewhat idealized cases.
The majority of boundaries are of a mixed type, containing dislocations of
different types and Burgers vectors, in order to create the best fit between
the neighboring grains.
If the dislocations in the boundary remain isolated and distinct, the boundary
can be considered to be low-angle. If deformation continues, the density of
dislocations will increase and so reduce the spacing between neighboring
dislocations. Eventually, the cores of the dislocations will begin to overlap
and the ordered nature of the boundary will begin to break down. At this point
the boundary can be considered to be high-angle and the original grain to have
separated into two entirely separate grains.
In comparison to low-angle grain boundaries, high-angle boundaries are
considerably more disordered, with large areas of poor fit and a comparatively
open structure. Indeed, they were originally thought to be some form of
amorphous or even liquid layer between the grains. However, this model could
not explain the observed strength of grain boundaries and, after the invention
of electron_microscopy, direct evidence of the grain structure meant the
hypothesis had to be discarded. It is now accepted that a boundary consists of
structural units which depend on both the misorientation of the two grains and
the plane of the interface. The types of structural unit that exist can be
related to the concept of the coincidence site lattice, in which repeated units
are formed from points where the two misoriented lattices happen to coincide.
In coincident site lattice (CSL) theory, the degree of fit (Î£) between the
structures of the two grains is described by the reciprocal of the ratio of
coincidence sites to the total number of sites.[2] In this framework, it is
possible to draw the lattice for the 2 grains and count the number of atoms
that are shared (coincidence sites), and the total number of atoms on the
boundary (total number of site). For example, when Î£=3 there will be one atom
of each three that will be shared between the two lattices. Thus a boundary
with high Î£ might be expected to have a higher energy than one with low Î£.
Low-angle boundaries, where the distortion is entirely accommodated by
dislocations, are Î£1. Some other low-Î£ boundaries have special properties,
especially when the boundary plane is one that contains a high density of
coincident sites. Examples include coherent twin boundaries (e.g., Î£3) and
high-mobility boundaries in FCC materials (e.g., Î£7). Deviations from the
ideal CSL orientation may be accommodated by local atomic relaxation or the
inclusion of dislocations at the boundary.
***** Describing a boundary[edit] *****
A boundary can be described by the orientation of the boundary to the two
grains and the 3-D rotation required to bring the grains into coincidence. Thus
a boundary has 5 macroscopic degrees_of_freedom. However, it is common to
describe a boundary only as the orientation relationship of the neighbouring
grains. Generally, the convenience of ignoring the boundary plane orientation,
which is very difficult to determine, outweighs the reduced information. The
relative orientation of the two grains is described using the rotation_matrix:
The characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations in a completely
randomly oriented set of grains for cubic symmetry materials.
         R =   [     a  11      a  12      a  13        a  21      a  22      a
      23        a  31      a  32      a  33      ]     {\displaystyle R={\begin
      {bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\a_{31}&a_{32}&a_
      {33}\end{bmatrix}}}  [R={\begin{bmatrix}a_{{11}}&a_{{12}}&a_{{13}}\\a_{
      {21}}&a_{{22}}&a_{{23}}\\a_{{31}}&a_{{32}}&a_{{33}}\end{bmatrix}}]
Using this system the rotation angle Î¸ is:
         2 cos  &#x03B8;  + 1 =  a  11   +  a  22   +  a  33
      {\displaystyle 2\cos \;\theta \;+1=a_{11}+a_{22}+a_{33}\,\!}  [2\cos
      \;\theta \;+1=a_{{11}}+a_{{22}}+a_{{33}}\,\!]
while the direction [uvw] of the rotation axis is:
         [ (  a  32   &#x2212;  a  23   ) , (  a  13   &#x2212;  a  31   ) ,
      (  a  21   &#x2212;  a  12   ) ]     {\displaystyle [(a_{32}-a_{23}),(a_
      {13}-a_{31}),(a_{21}-a_{12})]\,\!}  [[(a_{{32}}-a_{{23}}),(a_{{13}}-a_{
      {31}}),(a_{{21}}-a_{{12}})]\,\!]
The nature of the crystallography involved limits the misorientation of the
boundary. A completely random polycrystal, with no texture, thus has a
characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations (see figure). However,
such cases are rare and most materials will deviate from this ideal to a
greater or lesser degree.
***** Boundary energy[edit] *****
The energy of a tilt boundary and the energy per dislocation as the
misorientation of the boundary increases
The energy of a low-angle boundary is dependent on the degree of misorientation
between the neighbouring grains up to the transition to high-angle status. In
the case of simple tilt boundaries the energy of a boundary made up of
dislocations with Burgers vector b and spacing h is predicted by the
ReadâShockley equation:
          &#x03B3;  s   =  &#x03B3;  0   &#x03B8; ( A &#x2212; ln &#x2061;
      &#x03B8; )     {\displaystyle \gamma _{s}=\gamma _{0}\theta (A-\ln \theta
      )\,\!}  [\gamma _{s}=\gamma _{0}\theta (A-\ln \theta )\,\!]
where:
         &#x03B8; = b  /  h     {\displaystyle \theta =b/h\,\!}  [\theta =b/
      h\,\!]
          &#x03B3;  0   = G b  /  4 &#x03C0; ( 1 &#x2212; &#x03BD; )
      {\displaystyle \gamma _{0}=Gb/4\pi (1-\nu )\,\!}  [\gamma _{0}=Gb/4\pi
      (1-\nu )\,\!]
         A = 1 + ln &#x2061; ( b  /  2 &#x03C0;  r  0   )     {\displaystyle
      A=1+\ln(b/2\pi r_{0})\,\!}  [{\displaystyle A=1+\ln(b/2\pi r_{0})\,\!}]
with     G   {\displaystyle G}  [G] is the shear_modulus,     &#x03BD;
{\displaystyle \nu }  [\nu ] is Poisson's_ratio, and      r  0
{\displaystyle r_{0}}  [r_{0}] is the radius of the dislocation core. It can be
seen that as the energy of the boundary increases the energy per dislocation
decreases. Thus there is a driving force to produce fewer, more misoriented
boundaries (i.e., grain_growth).
The situation in high-angle boundaries is more complex. Although theory
predicts that the energy will be a minimum for ideal CSL configurations, with
deviations requiring dislocations and other energetic features, empirical
measurements suggest the relationship is more complicated. Some predicted
troughs in energy are found as expected while others missing or substantially
reduced. Surveys of the available experimental data have indicated that simple
relationships such as low     &#x03A3;   {\displaystyle \Sigma }  [\Sigma ] are
misleading:
     It is concluded that no general and useful criterion for low energy
     can be enshrined in a simple geometric framework. Any understanding
     of the variations of interfacial energy must take account of the
     atomic structure and the details of the bonding at the interface.[3]
***** Excess volume[edit] *****
The excess volume is another important property in the characterization of
grain boundaries. Excess volume was first proposed by Bishop in a private
communication to Aaron and Bolling in 1972.[4] It describes how much expansion
is induced by the presence of a GB and is thought that the degree and
susceptibility of segregation is directly proportional to this. Despite the
name the excess volume is actually a change in length, this is because of the
2D nature of GBs the length of interest is the expansion normal to the GB
plane. The excess volume (    &#x03B4; V   {\displaystyle \delta V}  [\delta
V]) is defined in the following way,
         &#x03B4; V =   (    &#x2202; V   &#x2202; A    )   T , p ,  n  i     ,
      {\displaystyle \delta V=\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial A}}\right)_
      {T,p,n_{i}},}  [{\displaystyle \delta V=\left({\frac {\partial V}
      {\partial A}}\right)_{T,p,n_{i}},}]
at constant temperature     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T], pressure     p
{\displaystyle p}  [p] and number of atoms      n  i     {\displaystyle n_{i}}
[n_{i}]. Although a rough linear relationship between GB energy and excess
volume exists the orientations where this relationship is violated can behave
significantly differently affecting mechanical and electrical properties.[5]
Experimental techniques have been developed which directly probe the excess
volume and have been used to explore the properties of nanocrystalline copper
and nickel.[6][7] Theoretical methods have also been developed [8] and are in
good agreement. A key observation is that there is an inverse relationship with
the bulk modulus meaning that the larger the bulk modulus (the ability to
compress a material) the smaller the excess volume will be, there is also
direct relationship with the lattice constant, this provides methodology to
find materials with a desirable excess volume for a specific application.
***** Boundary migration[edit] *****
The movement of grain boundaries (HAGB) has implications for recrystallization
and grain_growth while subgrain boundary (LAGB) movement strongly influences
recovery and the nucleation of recrystallization.
A boundary moves due to a pressure acting on it. It is generally assumed that
the velocity is directly proportional to the pressure with the constant of
proportionality being the mobility of the boundary. The mobility is strongly
temperature dependent and often follows an Arrhenius_type_relationship:
         M =  M  0   exp &#x2061;  (  &#x2212;   Q  R T     )
      {\displaystyle M=M_{0}\exp \left(-{\frac {Q}{RT}}\right)\,\!}  [M=M_
      {0}\exp \left(-{\frac  {Q}{RT}}\right)\,\!]
The apparent activation energy (Q) may be related to the thermally activated
atomistic processes that occur during boundary movement. However, there are
several proposed mechanisms where the mobility will depend on the driving
pressure and the assumed proportionality may break down.
It is generally accepted that the mobility of low-angle boundaries is much
lower than that of high-angle boundaries. The following observations appear to
hold true over a range of conditions:
    * The mobility of low-angle boundaries is proportional to the pressure
      acting on it.
    * The rate controlling process is that of bulk diffusion
    * The boundary mobility increases with misorientation.
Since low-angle boundaries are composed of arrays of dislocations and their
movement may be related to dislocation theory. The most likely mechanism, given
the experimental data, is that of dislocation climb, rate limited by the
diffusion of solute in the bulk.[9]
The movement of high-angle boundaries occurs by the transfer of atoms between
the neighbouring grains. The ease with which this can occur will depend on the
structure of the boundary, itself dependent on the crystallography of the
grains involved, impurity atoms and the temperature. It is possible that some
form of diffusionless mechanism (akin to diffusionless phase transformations
such as martensite) may operate in certain conditions. Some defects in the
boundary, such as steps and ledges, may also offer alternative mechanisms for
atomic transfer.
Grain growth can be inhibited by second phase particles via Zener_pinning.
Since a high-angle boundary is imperfectly packed compared to the normal
lattice it has some amount of free space or free volume where solute atoms may
possess a lower energy. As a result, a boundary may be associated with a solute
atmosphere that will retard its movement. Only at higher velocities will the
boundary be able to break free of its atmosphere and resume normal motion.
Both low- and high-angle boundaries are retarded by the presence of particles
via the so-called Zener_pinning effect. This effect is often exploited in
commercial alloys to minimise or prevent recrystallization or grain_growth
during heat-treatment.
***** Complexion[edit] *****
Grain boundaries are the preferential site for segregation of impurities, which
may form a thin layer with a different composition from the bulk. For example,
a thin layer of silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present
in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable
and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to
transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this case structure and
chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic
parameter like temperature or pressure.[10] This may strongly affect the
macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance
or creep rates.[11] Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium
thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy
Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure,
composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an
interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its
abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2â20
Ã). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and
structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk
phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich
amorphous layer present in Si3N3, is about 10 Ã thick, but for special
boundaries this equilibrium thickness is zero.[12] Complexion can be grouped in
6 categories, according to their thickness: monolayer, bilayer, trilayer,
nanolayer (with equilibrium thickness between 1 and 2 nm) and wetting. In the
first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is
present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case
there is no equilibrium thickness and this is determined by the amount of
secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary
complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-
doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.[13]
***** Effect to the electronic structure[edit] *****
Grain boundaries can cause failure mechanically by embrittlement through solute
segregation (see Hinkley_Point_A_nuclear_power_station) but they also can
detrimentally affect the electronic properties. In metal oxides it has been
shown theoretically that at the grain boundaries in Al2O3 and MgO the
insulating properties can be significantly diminished.[14] Using density
functional_theory computer simulations of grain boundaries have shown that the
band gap can be reduced by up to 45%.[15] In the case of metals grain
boundaries increase the resistivity as the size of the grains relative to the
mean free path of other scatters becomes significant.[16]
***** Defect concentration near grain boundaries[edit] *****
It is known that most materials are polycrystalline and contain grain
boundaries and that grain boundaries can act as sinks and transport pathways
for point defects. However experimentally and theoretically determining what
effect point defects have on a system is difficult.[17][18][19] Interesting
examples of the complications of how point defect behave has been manifested in
the temperature dependence of the Seebeck effect.[20] In addition the
dielectric and piezoelectric response can be altered by the distribution of
point defects near grain boundaries.[21] Mechanical properties can also be
significantly influenced with properties such as the bulk modulus and damping
being influenced by changes to the distribution of point defects within a
material.[22][23] It has also been found that the Kondo effect within graphene
can be tuned due to a complex relationship between grain boundaries and point
defects.[24] Recent theoretical calculations have revealed that point defects
can be extremely favourable near certain grain boundary types and significantly
affect the electronic properties with a reduction in the band gap.[25]
