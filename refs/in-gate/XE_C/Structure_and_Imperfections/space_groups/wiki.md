The space group of hexagonal H2O ice is P63/mmc. The first m indicates the
mirror plane perpendicular to the c-axis (a), the second m indicates the mirror
planes parallel to the c-axis (b), and the c indicates the glide planes (b) and
(c). The black boxes outline the unit cell.
In mathematics, physics and chemistry, a space group is the symmetry_group of a
configuration in space, usually in three_dimensions.[1] In three dimensions,
there are 219 distinct types, or 230 if chiral copies are considered distinct.
Space groups are also studied in dimensions other than 3 where they are
sometimes called Bieberbach groups, and are discrete cocompact groups of
isometries of an oriented Euclidean space.
In crystallography, space groups are also called the crystallographic or
Fedorov groups, and represent a description of the symmetry of the crystal. A
definitive source regarding 3-dimensional space groups is the International
Tables for Crystallography (Hahn_(2002)).

***** History[edit] *****
Space groups in 2 dimensions are the 17 wallpaper_groups which have been known
for several centuries, though the proof that the list was complete was only
given in 1891, after the much more difficult classification of space groups had
been completed.
In 1879 Leonhard_Sohncke listed the 65 space groups (called Sohncke groups)
whose elements preserve the orientation. More accurately, he listed 66 groups,
but Fedorov and SchÃ¶nflies both noticed that two of them were really the same.
The space groups in three dimensions were first enumerated by Fedorov (1891)
(whose list had two omissions (I43d and Fdd2) and one duplication (Fmm2)), and
shortly afterwards were independently enumerated by SchÃ¶nflies (1891) (whose
list had four omissions (I43d, Pc, Cc, ?) and one duplication (P421m)). The
correct list of 230 space groups was found by 1892 during correspondence
between Fedorov and SchÃ¶nflies. Barlow (1894) later enumerated the groups with
a different method, but omitted four groups (Fdd2, I42d, P421d, and P421c) even
though he already had the correct list of 230 groups from Fedorov and
SchÃ¶nflies; the common claim that Barlow was unaware of their work is a myth.
[citation_needed] Burckhardt_(1967) describes the history of the discovery of
the space groups in detail.
***** Elements[edit] *****
The space groups in three dimensions are made from combinations of the 32
crystallographic_point_groups with the 14 Bravais_lattices, each of the latter
belonging to one of 7 lattice_systems. This results in a space group being some
combination of the translational symmetry of a unit_cell including lattice
centering, the point group symmetry operations of reflection, rotation and
improper_rotation (also called rotoinversion), and the screw_axis and glide
plane symmetry operations. The combination of all these symmetry operations
results in a total of 230 different space groups describing all possible
crystal symmetries.
**** Elements fixing a point[edit] ****
The elements of the space group fixing a point of space are the identity
element, reflections, rotations and improper_rotations.
**** Translations[edit] ****
The translations form a normal abelian subgroup of rank 3, called the Bravais
lattice. There are 14 possible types of Bravais lattice. The quotient of the
space group by the Bravais lattice is a finite group which is one of the 32
possible point_groups. Translation is defined as the face moves from one point
to another point.
**** Glide planes[edit] ****
A glide_plane is a reflection in a plane, followed by a translation parallel
with that plane. This is noted by a, b or c, depending on which axis the glide
is along. There is also the n glide, which is a glide along the half of a
diagonal of a face, and the d glide, which is a fourth of the way along either
a face or space diagonal of the unit cell. The latter is called the diamond
glide plane as it features in the diamond structure. In 17 space groups, due to
the centering of the cell, the glides occur in two perpendicular directions
simultaneously, i.e. the same glide plane can be called b or c, a or b, a or c.
For example, group Abm2 could be also called Acm2, group Ccca could be called
Cccb. In 1992, it was suggested to use symbol e for such planes. The symbols
for five space groups have been modified:
Space group No. 39   41   64   67   68
New symbol      Aem2 Aea2 Cmce Cmme Ccce
Old Symbol      Abm2 Aba2 Cmca Cmma Ccca
**** Screw axes[edit] ****
A screw_axis is a rotation about an axis, followed by a translation along the
direction of the axis. These are noted by a number, n, to describe the degree
of rotation, where the number is how many operations must be applied to
complete a full rotation (e.g., 3 would mean a rotation one third of the way
around the axis each time). The degree of translation is then added as a
subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of
the parallel lattice vector. So, 21 is a twofold rotation followed by a
translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector.
**** General formula[edit] ****
The general formula for the action of an element of a space group is
y = M.x + D
where M is its matrix, D is its vector, and where the element transforms point
x into point y. In general, D = D(lattice) + D(M), where D(M) is a unique
function of M that is zero for M being the identity. The matrices M form a
point_group that is a basis of the space group; the lattice must be symmetric
under that point group.
The lattice dimension can be less than the overall dimension, resulting in a
"subperiodic" space group. For (overall dimension, lattice dimension):
    * (1,1): One-dimensional line_groups
    * (2,1): Two-dimensional line_groups: frieze_groups
    * (2,2): Wallpaper_groups
    * (3,1): Three-dimensional line_groups; with the 3D crystallographic point
      groups, the rod_groups
    * (3,2): Layer_groups
    * (3,3): The space groups discussed in this article
***** Notation[edit] *****
Further information: List_of_space_groups
There are at least ten methods of naming space groups. Some of these methods
can assign several different names to the same space group, so altogether there
are many thousands of different names.
    * Number. The International Union of Crystallography publishes tables of
      all space group types, and assigns each a unique number from 1 to 230.
      The numbering is arbitrary, except that groups with the same crystal
      system or point group are given consecutive numbers.
    * International symbol or HermannâMauguin_notation. The HermannâMauguin
      (or international) notation describes the lattice and some generators for
      the group. It has a shortened form called the international short symbol,
      which is the one most commonly used in crystallography, and usually
      consists of a set of four symbols. The first describes the centering of
      the Bravais lattice (P, A, B, C, I, R or F). The next three describe the
      most prominent symmetry operation visible when projected along one of the
      high symmetry directions of the crystal. These symbols are the same as
      used in point_groups, with the addition of glide planes and screw axis,
      described above. By way of example, the space group of quartz is P3121,
      showing that it exhibits primitive centering of the motif (i.e., once per
      unit cell), with a threefold screw axis and a twofold rotation axis. Note
      that it does not explicitly contain the crystal_system, although this is
      unique to each space group (in the case of P3121, it is trigonal).
      In the international short symbol the first symbol (31 in this example)
      denotes the symmetry along the major axis (c-axis in trigonal cases), the
      second (2 in this case) along axes of secondary importance (a and b) and
      the third symbol the symmetry in another direction. In the trigonal case
      there also exists a space group P3112. In this space group the twofold
      axes are not along the a and b-axes but in a direction rotated by 30Â°.
      The international symbols and international short symbols for some of the
      space groups were changed slightly between 1935 and 2002, so several
      space groups have 4 different international symbols in use.
The viewing directions of the 7 crystal systems are shown as follows.
Position
in the   Triclinic Monoclinic Orthorhombic Tetragonal Trigonal Hexagonal Cubic
symbol
1        â    b          a            c          c        c         a
2        â               b            a          a        a         [111]
3        â               c            [110]      [210]    [210]     [110]
    * Hall notation[1]. Space group notation with an explicit origin. Rotation,
      translation and axis-direction symbols are clearly separated and
      inversion centers are explicitly defined. The construction and format of
      the notation make it particularly suited to computer generation of
      symmetry information. For example, group number 3 has three Hall symbols:
      P 2y (P 1 2 1), P 2 (P 1 1 2), P 2x (P 2 1 1).
    * SchÃ¶nflies_notation. The space groups with given point group are
      numbered by 1, 2, 3, ... (in the same order as their international
      number) and this number is added as a superscript to the SchÃ¶nflies
      symbol for the point group. For example, groups numbers 3 to 5 whose
      point group is C2 have SchÃ¶nflies symbols C1
      2, C2
      2, C3
      2.
    * Fedorov notation
    * Shubnikov symbol
    * Strukturbericht_designation is related notation for crystal structures
      given a letter and index: A Elements (monatomic), B for AB compounds, C
      for AB2 compounds, D for AmâBn compounds, (E, F, â¦, K More complex
      compounds), L Alloys, O Organic compounds, S Silicates. Some structure
      designation share the same space groups. For example, space group 225 is
      A1, B1, and C1. Space group 221 is Ah, and B2.[2] However,
      crystallographers would not use Strukturbericht notation to describe the
      space group, rather it would be used to describe a specific crystal
      structure (e.g. space group + atomic arrangement (motif)).
    * 2D:Orbifold_notation and 3D:Fibrifold_notation. As the name suggests, the
      orbifold notation describes the orbifold, given by the quotient of
      Euclidean space by the space group, rather than generators of the space
      group. It was introduced by Conway and Thurston, and is not used much
      outside mathematics. Some of the space groups have several different
      fibrifolds associated to them, so have several different fibrifold
      symbols.
    * Coxeter_notation â Spatial and point symmetry groups, represented as
      modications of the pure reflectional Coxeter_groups.
    * Geometric_notation[3] is a Geometric_algebra notation.
***** Classification systems[edit] *****
There are (at least) 10 different ways to classify space groups into classes.
The relations between some of these are described in the following table. Each
classification system is a refinement of the ones below it.
(Crystallographic) space group types (230 in three dimensions). Two space
groups, considered as subgroups of the group of affine transformations of
space, have the same space group type if they are conjugate by an orientation-
preserving affine transformation. In three dimensions, for 11 of the affine
space groups, there is no orientation-preserving map from the group to its
mirror image, so if one distinguishes groups from their mirror images these
each split into two cases. So there are 54 + 11 = 65 space group types that
preserve orientation.
Affine space group types (219 in three dimensions). Two space groups,
considered as subgroups of the group of affine transformations of space, have
the same affine space group type if they are conjugate under an affine
transformation. The affine space group type is determined by the underlying
abstract group of the space group. In three dimensions there are 54 affine
space group types that preserve orientation.
Arithmetic crystal classes (73 in three dimensions). Sometimes called Z-
classes. These are determined by the point group together with the action of
the point group on the subgroup of translations. In other words, the arithmetic
crystal classes correspond to conjugacy classes of finite subgroup of the
general linear group GLn(Z) over the integers. A space group is called
symmorphic (or split) if there is a point such that all symmetries are the
product of a symmetry fixing this point and a translation. Equivalently, a
space group is symmorphic if it is a semidirect_product of its point group with
its translation subgroup. There are 73 symmorphic space groups, with exactly
one in each arithmetic crystal class. There are also 157 nonsymmorphic space
group types with varying numbers in the arithmetic crystal classes.
Arithmetic crystal classes may be interpreted as different orientations of the
point groups in the lattice, with the group elements' matrix components being
constrained to have integer coefficients in lattice space. This is rather easy
to picture in the two-dimensional, wallpaper_group case. Some of the point
groups have reflections, and the reflection lines can be along the lattice
directions, halfway in between them, or both.
    * None: C1: p1; C2: p2; C3: p3; C4: p4; C6: p6
    * Along: D1: pm, pg; D2: pmm, pmg, pgg; D3: p31m
    * Between: D1: cm; D2: cmm; D3: p3m1
    * Both: D4: p4m, p4g; D6: p6m

lattice system, and the remaining       hexagonal lattice systems.
crystal systems and lattice systems are
the same.
Crystal_families (6 in three dimensions). The point group of a space group does
not quite determine its lattice system, because occasionally two space groups
with the same point group may be in different lattice systems. Crystal families
are formed from lattice systems by merging the two lattice systems whenever
this happens, so that the crystal family of a space group is determined by
either its lattice system or its point group. In 3 dimensions the only two
lattice families that get merged in this way are the hexagonal and rhombohedral
lattice systems, which are combined into the hexagonal crystal family. The 6
crystal families in 3 dimensions are called triclinic, monoclinic,
orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and cubic. Crystal families are commonly
used in popular books on crystals, where they are sometimes called crystal
systems.
Conway, Delgado Friedrichs, and Huson et al. (2001) gave another classification
of the space groups, called a fibrifold_notation, according to the fibrifold
structures on the corresponding orbifold. They divided the 219 affine space
groups into reducible and irreducible groups. The reducible groups fall into 17
classes corresponding to the 17 wallpaper_groups, and the remaining 35
irreducible groups are the same as the cubic_groups and are classified
separately.
***** In other dimensions[edit] *****
**** Bieberbach's theorems[edit] ****
In n dimensions, an affine space group, or Bieberbach group, is a discrete
subgroup of isometries of n-dimensional Euclidean space with a compact
fundamental domain. Bieberbach (1911, 1912) proved that the subgroup of
translations of any such group contains n linearly independent translations,
and is a free abelian subgroup of finite index, and is also the unique maximal
normal abelian subgroup. He also showed that in any dimension n there are only
a finite number of possibilities for the isomorphism class of the underlying
group of a space group, and moreover the action of the group on Euclidean space
is unique up to conjugation by affine transformations. This answers part of
Hilbert's_eighteenth_problem. Zassenhaus_(1948) showed that conversely any
group that is the extension[when_defined_as?] of Zn by a finite group acting
faithfully is an affine space group. Combining these results shows that
classifying space groups in n dimensions up to conjugation by affine
transformations is essentially the same as classifying isomorphism classes for
groups that are extensions of Zn by a finite group acting faithfully.
It is essential in Bieberbach's theorems to assume that the group acts as
isometries; the theorems do not generalize to discrete cocompact groups of
affine transformations of Euclidean space. A counter-example is given by the 3-
dimensional Heisenberg group of the integers acting by translations on the
Heisenberg group of the reals, identified with 3-dimensional Euclidean space.
This is a discrete cocompact group of affine transformations of space, but does
not contain a subgroup Z3.
**** Classification in small dimensions[edit] ****

the numbers of various classes of space group. The numbers of enantiomorphic
pairs are given in parentheses.

a - Trivial group
b - One is the group of integers and the other is the infinite_dihedral_group;
see symmetry_groups_in_one_dimension
c - these 2D space groups are also called wallpaper_groups or plane groups.
d - In 3D there are 230 crystallographic space group types, which reduces to
219 affine space group types because of some types being different from their
mirror image; these are said to differ by "enantiomorphous character" (e.g.
P3112 and P3212). Usually "space group" refers to 3D. They were enumerated
independently by Barlow_(1894), Fedorov_(1891) and SchÃ¶nflies_(1891).
e - The 4895 4-dimensional groups were enumerated by Harold Brown, Rolf BÃ¼low,
and Joachim NeubÃ¼ser et al. (1978). NeubÃ¼ser,_Souvignier_&_Wondratschek_
(2002) corrected the number of enantiomorphic groups from 112 to 111, so total
number of groups is 4783+111=4894. There are 44 enantiomorphic point groups in
4-dimensional space. If we consider enantiomorphic groups as different, the
total number of point groups is 227+44=271.
f - Plesken_&_Schulz_(2000) enumerated the ones of dimension 5. Souvignier_
(2003) counted the enantiomorphs.
g - Plesken_&_Schulz_(2000) enumerated the ones of dimension 6, later the
corrected figures were found.[4] Initially published number of 826 Lattice
types in Plesken_&_Hanrath_(1984) was corrected to 841 in Opgenorth,_Plesken_&
Schulz_(1998). See also Janssen_et_al._(2002). Souvignier_(2003) counted the
enantiomorphs, but that paper relied on old erroneous CARAT data for dimension
6.
**** Magnetic groups and time reversal[edit] ****
Main article: Magnetic_space_group
In addition to crystallographic space groups there are also magnetic space
groups (also called two-color (black and white) crystallographic groups or
Shubnikov groups). These symmetries contain an element known as time reversal.
They treat time as an additional dimension, and the group elements can include
time reversal as reflection in it. They are of importance in magnetic
structures that contain ordered unpaired spins, i.e. ferro-, ferri- or
antiferromagnetic structures as studied by neutron_diffraction. The time
reversal element flips a magnetic spin while leaving all other structure the
same and it can be combined with a number of other symmetry elements. Including
time reversal there are 1651 magnetic space groups in 3D (Kim_1999, p.428). It
has also been possible to construct magnetic versions for other overall and
lattice dimensions (Daniel_Litvin's_papers, (Litvin_2008), (Litvin_2005)).
Frieze groups are magnetic 1D line groups and layer groups are magnetic
wallpaper groups, and the axial 3D point groups are magnetic 2D point groups.

Note. An e plane is a double glide plane, one having glides in two different
directions. They are found in seven orthorhombic, five tetragonal and five
cubic space groups, all with centered lattice. The use of the symbol e became
official with Hahn_(2002).
The lattice system can be found as follows. If the crystal system is not
trigonal then the lattice system is of the same type. If the crystal system is
trigonal, then the lattice system is hexagonal unless the space group is one of
the seven in the rhombohedral_lattice_system consisting of the 7 trigonal space
groups in the table above whose name begins with R. (The term rhombohedral
system is also sometimes used as an alternative name for the whole trigonal
system.) The hexagonal_lattice_system is larger than the hexagonal crystal
system, and consists of the hexagonal crystal system together with the 18
groups of the trigonal crystal system other than the seven whose names begin
with R.
The Bravais_lattice of the space group is determined by the lattice system
together with the initial letter of its name, which for the non-rhombohedral
groups is P, I, F, or C, standing for the principal, body centered, face
centered, or C-face centered lattices.
***** Derivation of the crystal class from the space group[edit] *****
   1. Leave out the Bravais type
   2. Convert all symmetry elements with translational components into their
      respective symmetry elements without translation symmetry (Glide planes
      are converted into simple mirror planes; Screw axes are converted into
      simple axes of rotation)
   3. Axes of rotation, rotoinversion axes and mirror planes remain unchanged.
