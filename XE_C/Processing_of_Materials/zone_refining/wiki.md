Zone melting (or zone refining or floating zone process or travelling melting
zone) is a group of similar methods of purifying crystals, in which a narrow
region of a crystal is melted, and this molten zone is moved along the crystal.
The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of
purer material solidified behind it as it moves through the ingot. The
impurities concentrate in the melt, and are moved to one end of the ingot. Zone
refining was invented by John_Desmond_Bernal[1] and further developed by
William_Gardner_Pfann in Bell_Labs as a method to prepare high purity
materials, mainly semiconductors, for manufacturing transistors. Its first
commercial use was in germanium, refined to one atom of impurity per ten
billion,[2] but the process can be extended to virtually any solute-solvent
system having an appreciable concentration difference between solid and liquid
phases at equilibrium.[3] This process is also known as the float zone process,
particularly in semiconductor materials processing.

***** Process details[edit] *****
The principle is that the segregation coefficient k (the ratio of an impurity
in the solid phase to that in the liquid phase) is usually less than one.
Therefore, at the solid/liquid boundary, the impurity atoms will diffuse to the
liquid region. Thus, by passing a crystal boule through a thin section of
furnace very slowly, such that only a small region of the boule is molten at
any time, the impurities will be segregated at the end of the crystal. Because
of the lack of impurities in the leftover regions which solidify, the boule can
grow as a perfect single_crystal if a seed_crystal is placed at the base to
initiate a chosen direction of crystal growth. When high purity is required,
such as in semiconductor industry, the impure end of the boule is cut off, and
the refining is repeated.
In zone refining, solutes are segregated at one end of the ingot in order to
purify the remainder, or to concentrate the impurities. In zone leveling, the
objective is to distribute solute evenly throughout the purified material,
which may be sought in the form of a single crystal. For example, in the
preparation of a transistor or diode semiconductor, an ingot of germanium is
first purified by zone refining. Then a small amount of antimony is placed in
the molten zone, which is passed through the pure germanium. With the proper
choice of rate of heating and other variables, the antimony can be spread
evenly through the germanium. This technique is also used for the preparation
of silicon for use in computer_chips.
**** Heaters[edit] ****
A variety of heaters can be used for zone melting, with their most important
characteristic being the ability to form short molten zones that move slowly
and uniformly through the ingot. Induction_coils, ring-wound resistance
heaters, or gas flames are common methods. Another method is to pass an
electric_current directly through the ingot while it is in a magnetic_field,
with the resulting magnetomotive_force carefully set to be just equal to the
weight in order to hold the liquid suspended. Optical heaters using high
powered halogen or xenon lamps are used extensively in research facilities
particularly for the production of insulators, but their use in industry is
limited by the relatively low power of the lamps, which limits the size of
crystals produced by this method. Zone melting can be done as a batch_process,
or it can be done continuously, with fresh impure material being continually
added at one end and purer material being removed from the other, with impure
zone melt being removed at whatever rate is dictated by the impurity of the
feed stock.
Indirect-heating floating zone methods use an induction-heated tungsten ring to
heat the ingot radiatively, and are useful when the ingot is of a high-
resistivity semiconductor on which classical induction heating is ineffective.
**** Mathematical expression of impurity concentration[edit] ****
When the liquid zone moves by a distance     d x   {\displaystyle dx}  [dx],
the number of impurities in the liquid change. Impurities are incorporated in
the melting liquid and freezing solid.[4]
          k  O     {\displaystyle k_{O}}  [k_{O}]: Segregation coefficient
         L   {\displaystyle L}  [L]: Zone length
          C  O     {\displaystyle C_{O}}  [C_{O}]: Initial uniform impurity
      concentration of the rod
          C  L     {\displaystyle C_{L}}  [C_{L}]: Concentration of impurities
      in the liquid
         I   {\displaystyle I}  [I]: Number of impurities in the liquid
          I  O     {\displaystyle I_{O}}  [I_{O}]: Number of impurities in zone
      when first formed at bottom
The number of impurities in the liquid changes in accordance with the
expression below during the movement     d x   {\displaystyle dx}  [dx] of the
molten zone
         d I = (  C  O   &#x2212;  k  O    C  L   )  d x    {\displaystyle dI=
      (C_{O}-k_{O}C_{L})\,dx\;}  [dI=(C_{O}-k_{O}C_{L})\,dx\;]
          C  L   = I  /  L    {\displaystyle C_{L}=I/L\;}  [C_{L}=I/L\;]
          &#x222B;  0   x   d x =  &#x222B;   I  O     I      d I    C  O
      &#x2212;     k  O   I  L        {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{x}dx=\int _{I_
      {O}}^{I}{\frac {dI}{C_{O}-{\frac {k_{O}I}{L}}}}}  [\int _{0}^{x}dx=\int _
      {{I_{O}}}^{I}{\frac  {dI}{C_{O}-{\frac  {k_{O}I}{L}}}}]
          I  O   =  C  O   L    {\displaystyle I_{O}=C_{O}L\;}  [I_{O}=C_
      {O}L\;]
          C  S   =  k  O   I  /  L    {\displaystyle C_{S}=k_{O}I/L\;}  [C_
      {S}=k_{O}I/L\;]
          C  S   ( x ) =  C  O    (  1 &#x2212; ( 1 &#x2212;  k  O   )  e
      &#x2212;     k  O   x  L      )    {\displaystyle C_{S}(x)=C_{O}\left(1-
      (1-k_{O})e^{-{\frac {k_{O}x}{L}}}\right)}  [C_{S}(x)=C_{O}\left(1-(1-k_
      {O})e^{{-{\frac  {k_{O}x}{L}}}}\right)]
***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Solar cells[edit] ****
In solar_cells float zone processing is particularly useful because the single
crystal silicon grown has desirable properties. The bulk charge carrier
lifetime in float-zone_silicon is the highest among various manufacturing
processes. Float-zone carrier lifetimes are around 1000 microseconds compared
to 20-200 microseconds with Czochralski_process, and 1â30 microseconds with
cast multi-crystalline_silicon. A longer bulk lifetime increases the efficiency
of solar_cells significantly.
***** Related processes[edit] *****
**** Zone remelting[edit] ****
Another related process is zone remelting, in which two solutes are distributed
through a pure metal. This is important in the manufacture of semiconductors,
where two solutes of opposite conductivity type are used. For example, in
germanium, pentavalent elements of group_V such as antimony and arsenic produce
negative (n-type) conduction and the trivalent elements of group_III such as
aluminum and boron produce positive (p-type) conduction. By melting a portion
of such an ingot and slowly refreezing it, solutes in the molten region become
distributed to form the desired n-p and p-n junctions.
