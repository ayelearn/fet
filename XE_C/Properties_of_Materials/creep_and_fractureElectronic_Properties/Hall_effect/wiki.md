The Hall effect is the production of a voltage difference (the Hall voltage)
across an electrical_conductor, transverse to an electric_current in the
conductor and to an applied magnetic_field perpendicular to the current. It was
discovered by Edwin_Hall in 1879.[1] For clarity, the original effect is
sometimes called the ordinary Hall effect to distinguish it from other "Hall
effects" which have different physical mechanisms.
The Hall coefficient is defined as the ratio of the induced electric_field to
the product of the current density and the applied magnetic field. It is a
characteristic of the material from which the conductor is made, since its
value depends on the type, number, and properties of the charge_carriers that
constitute the current.

[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (March
         2019)
The modern theory of electromagnetism was systematized by James_Clerk_Maxwell
in the paper On_Physical_Lines_of_Force, which was published in four parts
between 1861-1862. While Maxwell's paper established a solid mathematical basis
for electromagnetic theory, the detailed mechanisms of the theory were still
being explored. One such question was about the details of the interaction
between magnets and electric current, including whether magnetic fields
interacted with the conductors or the electric current itself. In 1879 Edwin
Hall was exploring this interaction, and discovered the Hall effect while he
was working on his doctoral degree at Johns_Hopkins_University in Baltimore,
Maryland.[2] Eighteen years before the electron was discovered, his
measurements of the tiny effect produced in the apparatus he used were an
experimental tour_de_force, published under the name "On a New Action of the
Magnet on Electric Currents".[3][4][5]
***** Theory[edit] *****
The Hall effect is due to the nature of the current in a conductor. Current
consists of the movement of many small charge_carriers, typically electrons,
holes, ions (see Electromigration) or all three. When a magnetic field is
present, these charges experience a force, called the Lorentz_force.[6] When
such a magnetic field is absent, the charges follow approximately straight,
'line of sight' paths between collisions with impurities, phonons, etc.
However, when a magnetic field with a perpendicular component is applied, their
paths between collisions are curved, thus moving charges accumulate on one face
of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other
face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The result is an asymmetric
distribution of charge density across the Hall element, arising from a force
that is perpendicular to both the 'line of sight' path and the applied magnetic
field. The separation of charge establishes an electric_field that opposes the
migration of further charge, so a steady electric_potential is established for
as long as the charge is flowing.
In classical_electromagnetism electrons move in the opposite direction of the
current I (by convention "current" describes a theoretical "hole flow"). In
some semiconductors it appears "holes" are actually flowing because the
direction of the voltage is opposite to the derivation below.
Hall effect measurement setup for electrons. Initially, the electrons follow
the curved arrow, due to the magnetic force. At some distance from the current-
introducing contacts, electrons pile up on the left side and deplete from the
right side, which creates an electric field Î¾y in the direction of the
assigned VH. VH is negative for some semiconductors where "holes" appear to
flow. In steady-state, Î¾y will be strong enough to exactly cancel out the
magnetic force, thus the electrons follow the straight arrow (dashed).

Animation showing the simplified principle
For a simple metal where there is only one type of charge_carrier (electrons),
the Hall voltage VH can be derived by using the Lorentz_force and seeing that,
in the steady-state condition, charges are not moving in the y-axis direction.
Thus, the magnetic force on each electron in the y-axis direction is cancelled
by a y-axis electrical force due to the buildup of charges. The vx term is the
drift_velocity of the current which is assumed at this point to be holes by
convention. The vxBz term is negative in the y-axis direction by the right hand
rule.
          F  = q   (    E  +  v  &#x00D7;  B    )     {\displaystyle \mathbf
      {F} =q{\bigl (}\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} {\bigl )}}  [
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q{\bigl (}\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times
      \mathbf {B} {\bigl )}}]
In steady state, F = 0, so 0 = Ey â vxBz, where Ey is assigned in the
direction of the y-axis, (and not with the arrow of the induced electric field
Î¾y as in the image (pointing in the ây direction), which tells you where the
field caused by the electrons is pointing).
In wires, electrons instead of holes are flowing, so vx â âvx and q â
âq. Also Ey = âVH/w. Substituting these changes gives
          V   H    =  v  x    B  z   w   {\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {H} }=v_
      {x}B_{z}w}  [{\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {H} }=v_{x}B_{z}w}]
The conventional "hole" current is in the negative direction of the electron
current and the negative of the electrical charge which gives Ix = ntw(âvx)
(âe) where n is charge_carrier_density, tw is the cross-sectional area, and
âe is the charge of each electron. Solving for     w   {\displaystyle w}  [w]
and plugging into the above gives the Hall voltage:
          V   H    =     I  x    B  z     n t e      {\displaystyle V_{\mathrm
      {H} }={\frac {I_{x}B_{z}}{nte}}}  [{\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {H} }={\frac
      {I_{x}B_{z}}{nte}}}]
If the charge build up had been positive (as it appears in some
semiconductors), then the VH assigned in the image would have been negative
(positive charge would have built up on the left side).
The Hall coefficient is defined as
          R   H    =    E  y     j  x    B  z        {\displaystyle R_{\mathrm
      {H} }={\frac {E_{y}}{j_{x}B_{z}}}}  [{\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {H} }=
      {\frac {E_{y}}{j_{x}B_{z}}}}]
where j is the current_density of the carrier electrons, and Ey is the induced
electric field. In SI units, this becomes
          R   H    =    E  y     j  x   B    =     V   H    t   I B    =
      &#x2212;   1  n e    .   {\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {H} }={\frac {E_{y}}
      {j_{x}B}}={\frac {V_{\mathrm {H} }t}{IB}}=-{\frac {1}{ne}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {H} }={\frac {E_{y}}{j_{x}B}}={\frac {V_
      {\mathrm {H} }t}{IB}}=-{\frac {1}{ne}}.}]
(The units of RH are usually expressed as m3/C, or Î©Â·cm/G, or other
variants.) As a result, the Hall effect is very useful as a means to measure
either the carrier density or the magnetic field.
One very important feature of the Hall effect is that it differentiates between
positive charges moving in one direction and negative charges moving in the
opposite. The Hall effect offered the first real proof that electric currents
in metals are carried by moving electrons, not by protons. The Hall effect also
showed that in some substances (especially p-type_semiconductors), it is more
appropriate to think of the current as positive "holes" moving rather than
negative electrons. A common source of confusion with the Hall effect is that
holes moving to the left are really electrons moving to the right, so one
expects the same sign of the Hall coefficient for both electrons and holes.
This confusion, however, can only be resolved by modern quantum mechanical
theory of transport in solids.[7]
The sample inhomogeneity might result in spurious sign of the Hall effect, even
in ideal van_der_Pauw configuration of electrodes. For example, positive Hall
effect was observed in evidently n-type semiconductors.[8] Another source of
artifact, in uniform materials, occurs when the sample's aspect ratio is not
long enough: the full Hall voltage only develops far away from the current-
introducing contacts, since at the contacts the transverse voltage is shorted
out to zero.
**** Hall effect in semiconductors[edit] ****
When a current-carrying semiconductor is kept in a magnetic field, the charge
carriers of the semiconductor experience a force in a direction perpendicular
to both the magnetic field and the current. At equilibrium, a voltage appears
at the semiconductor edges.
The simple formula for the Hall coefficient given above is usually a good
explanation when conduction is dominated by a single charge_carrier. However,
in semiconductors the theory is more complex, because in these materials
conduction can involve significant, simultaneous contributions from both
electrons and holes, which may be present in different concentrations and have
different mobilities. For moderate magnetic fields the Hall coefficient is[9]
          R   H    =    p  &#x03BC;   h    2   &#x2212; n  &#x03BC;   e    2
      e   (  p  &#x03BC;   h    + n  &#x03BC;   e     )   2
      {\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {H} }={\frac {p\mu _{\mathrm {h} }^{2}-n\mu _
      {\mathrm {e} }^{2}}{e\left(p\mu _{\mathrm {h} }+n\mu _{\mathrm {e}
      }\right)^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {H} }={\frac {p\mu _{\mathrm
      {h} }^{2}-n\mu _{\mathrm {e} }^{2}}{e\left(p\mu _{\mathrm {h} }+n\mu _
      {\mathrm {e} }\right)^{2}}}}]
or equivalently
          R   H    =    (  p &#x2212; n  b  2    )   e   (  p + n b  )   2
      {\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {H} }={\frac {\left(p-nb^{2}\right)}{e\left
      (p+nb\right)^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {H} }={\frac {\left(p-nb^
      {2}\right)}{e\left(p+nb\right)^{2}}}}]
with
         b =    &#x03BC;   e     &#x03BC;   h        {\displaystyle b={\frac
      {\mu _{\mathrm {e} }}{\mu _{\mathrm {h} }}}}  [{\displaystyle b={\frac
      {\mu _{\mathrm {e} }}{\mu _{\mathrm {h} }}}}].
Here n is the electron concentration, p the hole concentration, Î¼e the
electron mobility, Î¼h the hole mobility and e the elementary charge.
For large applied fields the simpler expression analogous to that for a single
carrier type holds.
**** Relationship with star formation[edit] ****
Although it is well known that magnetic fields play an important role in star
formation, research models[10][11][12] indicate that Hall diffusion critically
influences the dynamics of gravitational collapse that forms protostars.
**** Quantum Hall effect[edit] ****
Main article: Quantum_Hall_effect
For a two-dimensional electron system which can be produced in a MOSFET, in the
presence of large magnetic_field strength and low temperature, one can observe
the quantum Hall effect, in which the Hall conductance Ï undergoes quantum
Hall_transitions to take on the quantized values.
**** Spin Hall effect[edit] ****
Main article: Spin_Hall_effect
The spin Hall effect consists in the spin accumulation on the lateral
boundaries of a current-carrying sample. No magnetic field is needed. It was
predicted by Mikhail_Dyakonov and V._I._Perel in 1971 and observed
experimentally more than 30 years later, both in semiconductors and in metals,
at cryogenic as well as at room temperatures.
**** Quantum spin Hall effect[edit] ****
Main article: Quantum_spin_Hall_effect
For mercury_telluride two dimensional quantum wells with strong spin-orbit
coupling, in zero magnetic field, at low temperature, the quantum spin Hall
effect has been recently observed.
**** Anomalous Hall effect[edit] ****
In ferromagnetic materials (and paramagnetic materials in a magnetic_field),
the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution, known as the
anomalous Hall effect (or the extraordinary Hall effect), which depends
directly on the magnetization of the material, and is often much larger than
the ordinary Hall effect. (Note that this effect is not due to the contribution
of the magnetization to the total magnetic_field.) For example, in nickel, the
anomalous Hall coefficient is about 100 times larger than the ordinary Hall
coefficient near the Curie temperature, but the two are similar at very low
temperatures.[13] Although a well-recognized phenomenon, there is still debate
about its origins in the various materials. The anomalous Hall effect can be
either an extrinsic (disorder-related) effect due to spin-dependent scattering
of the charge_carriers, or an intrinsic effect which can be described in terms
of the Berry_phase effect in the crystal momentum space (k-space).[14]
**** Hall effect in ionized gases[edit] ****
The Hall effect in an ionized gas (plasma) is significantly different from the
Hall effect in solids (where the Hall parameter is always much less than
unity). In a plasma, the Hall parameter can take any value. The Hall parameter,
Î², in a plasma is the ratio between the electron gyrofrequency, Î©e, and the
electron-heavy particle collision frequency, Î½:
         &#x03B2; =    &#x03A9;   e    &#x03BD;   =    e B    m   e    &#x03BD;
      {\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {\Omega _{\mathrm {e} }}{\nu }}={\frac {eB}
      {m_{\mathrm {e} }\nu }}}  [{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {\Omega _{\mathrm
      {e} }}{\nu }}={\frac {eB}{m_{\mathrm {e} }\nu }}}]
where
    * e is the elementary_charge (approximately 1.6Ã10â19 C)
    * B is the magnetic field (in teslas)
    * me is the electron_mass (approximately 9.1Ã10â31 kg).
The Hall parameter value increases with the magnetic field strength.
Physically, the trajectories of electrons are curved by the Lorentz_force.
Nevertheless, when the Hall parameter is low, their motion between two
encounters with heavy particles (neutral or ion) is almost linear. But if the
Hall parameter is high, the electron movements are highly curved. The current
density vector, J, is no longer collinear with the electric_field vector, E.
The two vectors J and E make the Hall angle, Î¸, which also gives the Hall
parameter:
         &#x03B2; = tan &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) .   {\displaystyle \beta =\tan
      (\theta ).}  [\beta =\tan(\theta ).]
**** Valley acoustoelectric Hall effect[edit] ****
There is a variety of the acousto-electric effect called the valley
acoustoelectric Hall effect (VAHE) theoretically predicted in 2019.[15] This
effect represents a nonlinear phenomenon of generation of transverse electric
current in two-dimensional materials, such as transition_metal_dichalcogenide
monolayers or graphene, located on a piezoelectric substrate by a propagating
acoustic_wave. The generated electric current is proportional to the intensity
of the acoustic wave and its direction is perpendicular to the acoustic wave
vector.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Hall_probes are often used as magnetometers, i.e. to measure magnetic fields,
or inspect materials (such as tubing or pipelines) using the principles of
magnetic_flux_leakage.
Hall effect devices produce a very low signal level and thus require
amplification. While suitable for laboratory instruments, the vacuum_tube
amplifiers available in the first half of the 20th century were too expensive,
power consuming, and unreliable for everyday applications. It was only with the
development of the low cost integrated_circuit that the Hall effect sensor
became suitable for mass application. Many devices now sold as Hall_effect
sensors in fact contain both the sensor as described above plus a high gain
integrated_circuit (IC) amplifier in a single package. Recent advances have
further added into one package an analog-to-digital_converter and IÂ²C (Inter-
integrated circuit communication protocol) IC for direct connection to a
microcontroller's I/O port.
**** Advantages over other methods[edit] ****
Hall effect devices (when appropriately packaged) are immune to dust, dirt,
mud, and water. These characteristics make Hall effect devices better for
position sensing than alternative means such as optical and electromechanical
sensing.
Hall effect current sensor with internal integrated circuit amplifier. 8 mm
opening. Zero current output voltage is midway between the supply voltages that
maintain a 4 to 8 volt differential. Non-zero current response is proportional
to the voltage supplied and is linear to 60 amperes for this particular (25 A)
device.
When electrons flow through a conductor, a magnetic field is produced. Thus, it
is possible to create a non-contacting current sensor. The device has three
terminals. A sensor voltage is applied across two terminals and the third
provides a voltage proportional to the current being sensed. This has several
advantages; no additional resistance (a shunt, required for the most common
current sensing method) need to be inserted in the primary circuit. Also, the
voltage present on the line to be sensed is not transmitted to the sensor,
which enhances the safety of measuring equipment.
**** Disadvantages compared with other methods[edit] ****
Magnetic flux from the surroundings (such as other wires) may diminish or
enhance the field the Hall probe intends to detect, rendering the results
inaccurate. Also, as Hall voltage is often on the order of millivolts, the
output from this type of sensor cannot be used to directly drive actuators but
instead must be amplified by a transistor-based circuit.
Ways to measure mechanical positions within an electromagnetic system, such as
a brushless direct current motor, include (1) the Hall effect, (2) optical
position encoder (e.g., absolute and incremental_encoders) and (3) induced
voltage by moving the amount of metal core inserted into a transformer. When
Hall is compared to photo-sensitive methods, it is harder to get absolute
position with Hall. Hall detection is also sensitive to stray magnetic fields.
[citation_needed]
**** Contemporary applications[edit] ****
Hall effect sensors are readily available from a number of different
manufacturers, and may be used in various sensors such as rotating speed
sensors (bicycle wheels, gear-teeth, automotive speedometers, electronic
ignition systems), fluid flow_sensors, current_sensors, and pressure_sensors.
Common applications are often found where a robust and contactless switch or
potentiometer is required. These include: electric airsoft guns, triggers of
electropneumatic paintball_guns, go-cart speed controls, smart phones, and some
global positioning systems.
*** Ferrite toroid Hall effect current transducer[edit] ***
Diagram of Hall effect current transducer integrated into ferrite ring.
Hall sensors can detect stray magnetic fields easily, including that of Earth,
so they work well as electronic compasses: but this also means that such stray
fields can hinder accurate measurements of small magnetic fields. To solve this
problem, Hall sensors are often integrated with magnetic shielding of some
kind. For example, a Hall sensor integrated into a ferrite ring (as shown) can
reduce the detection of stray fields by a factor of 100 or better (as the
external magnetic fields cancel across the ring, giving no residual magnetic
flux). This configuration also provides an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio
and drift effects of over 20 times that of a bare Hall device.
The range of a given feedthrough sensor may be extended upward and downward by
appropriate wiring. To extend the range to lower currents, multiple turns of
the current-carrying wire may be made through the opening, each turn adding to
the sensor output the same quantity; when the sensor is installed onto a
printed circuit board, the turns can be carried out by a staple on the board.
To extend the range to higher currents, a current divider may be used. The
divider splits the current across two wires of differing widths and the thinner
wire, carrying a smaller proportion of the total current, passes through the
sensor.
Multiple 'turns' and corresponding transfer function.
*** Split ring clamp-on sensor[edit] ***
A variation on the ring sensor uses a split_sensor which is clamped onto the
line enabling the device to be used in temporary test equipment. If used in a
permanent installation, a split sensor allows the electric current to be tested
without dismantling the existing circuit.
*** Analog multiplication[edit] ***
The output is proportional to both the applied magnetic field and the applied
sensor voltage. If the magnetic field is applied by a solenoid, the sensor
output is proportional to the product of the current through the solenoid and
the sensor voltage. As most applications requiring computation are now
performed by small digital_computers, the remaining useful application is in
power sensing, which combines current sensing with voltage sensing in a single
Hall effect device.
*** Power measurement[edit] ***
By sensing the current provided to a load and using the device's applied
voltage as a sensor voltage it is possible to determine the power dissipated by
a device.
*** Position and motion sensing[edit] ***
Hall effect devices used in motion sensing and motion limit switches can offer
enhanced reliability in extreme environments. As there are no moving parts
involved within the sensor or magnet, typical life expectancy is improved
compared to traditional electromechanical switches. Additionally, the sensor
and magnet may be encapsulated in an appropriate protective material. This
application is used in brushless_DC_motors.
Hall effect sensors, affixed to mechanical gauges that have magnetized
indicator needles, can translate the physical position or orientation of the
mechanical indicator needle into an electrical signal that can be used by
electronic indicators, controls or communications devices.[16]
*** Automotive ignition and fuel injection[edit] ***
Commonly used in distributors for ignition timing (and in some types of crank
and camshaft position sensors for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.)
the Hall effect sensor is used as a direct replacement for the mechanical
breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition
timing device in various distributor types is as follows. A stationary
permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall effect chip are mounted next to each
other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall effect sensor. A metal rotor
consisting of windows and tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that
during shaft rotation, the windows and tabs pass through the air gap between
the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and
exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet's field respective to whether a
tab or window is passing through the Hall sensor. For ignition timing purposes,
the metal rotor will have a number of equal-sized tabs and windows matching the
number of engine cylinders. This produces a uniform square wave output since
the on/off (shielding and exposure) time is equal. This signal is used by the
engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing. Many automotive Hall effect
sensors have a built-in internal NPN transistor with an open_collector and
grounded emitter, meaning that rather than a voltage being produced at the Hall
sensor signal output wire, the transistor is turned on providing a circuit to
ground through the signal output wire.
*** Wheel rotation sensing[edit] ***
The sensing of wheel rotation is especially useful in anti-lock_braking
systems. The principles of such systems have been extended and refined to offer
more than anti-skid functions, now providing extended vehicle handling
enhancements.
*** Electric motor control[edit] ***
Some types of brushless_DC_electric_motors use Hall effect sensors to detect
the position of the rotor and feed that information to the motor controller.
This allows for more precise motor control.
*** Industrial applications[edit] ***
Applications for Hall effect sensing have also expanded to industrial
applications, which now use Hall effect joysticks to control hydraulic valves,
replacing the traditional mechanical levers with contactless sensing. Such
applications include mining trucks, backhoe loaders, cranes, diggers, scissor
lifts, etc.
*** Spacecraft propulsion[edit] ***
A Hall-effect_thruster (HET) is a relatively low power device that is used to
propel some spacecraft, after it gets into orbit or farther out into space. In
the HET, atoms are ionized and accelerated by an electric_field. A radial
magnetic field established by magnets on the thruster is used to trap electrons
which then orbit and create an electric_field due to the Hall effect. A large
potential is established between the end of the thruster where neutral
propellant is fed, and the part where electrons are produced; so, electrons
trapped in the magnetic field cannot drop to the lower potential. They are thus
extremely energetic, which means that they can ionize neutral atoms. Neutral
propellant is pumped into the chamber and is ionized by the trapped electrons.
Positive ions and electrons are then ejected from the thruster as a
quasineutral plasma, creating thrust.
***** The Corbino effect[edit] *****
Corbino disc â dashed curves represent logarithmic_spiral paths of deflected
electrons
The Corbino effect is a phenomenon involving the Hall effect, but a disc-shaped
metal sample is used in place of a rectangular one. Because of its shape the
Corbino disc allows the observation of Hall effectâbased magnetoresistance
without the associated Hall voltage.
A radial current through a circular disc, subjected to a magnetic field
perpendicular to the plane of the disc, produces a "circular" current through
the disc.[17]
The absence of the free transverse boundaries renders the interpretation of the
Corbino effect simpler than that of the Hall effect.
