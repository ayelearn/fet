Pyrolytic_carbon has one of the largest diamagnetic constants of any room
temperature material. Here a pyrolytic carbon sheet is levitated by its
repulsion from the strong magnetic field of neodymium_magnets.
Diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic_field; an applied magnetic
field creates an induced_magnetic_field in them in the opposite direction,
causing a repulsive force. In contrast, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
materials are attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum
mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only
contribution to the magnetism, the material is called diamagnetic. In
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is
overcome by the attractive force of magnetic_dipoles in the material. The
magnetic_permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than Î¼0, the
permeability of vacuum. In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which
can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a superconductor
acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its
interior.

Dimagnetic material interaction in magnetic_field.
Diamagnetism was first discovered when Sebald_Justinus_Brugmans observed in
1778 that bismuth and antimony were repelled by magnetic fields. In 1845,
Michael_Faraday demonstrated that it was a property of matter and concluded
that every material responded (in either a diamagnetic or paramagnetic way) to
an applied magnetic field. On a suggestion by William_Whewell, Faraday first
referred to the phenomenon as diamagnetic (the prefix dia- meaning through or
across), then later changed it to diamagnetism.[1][2]

Diamagnetism is a property of all materials, and always makes a weak
contribution to the material's response to a magnetic field. However, other
forms of magnetism (such as ferromagnetism or paramagnetism) are so much
stronger that when multiple different forms of magnetism are present in a
material, the diamagnetic contribution is usually negligible. Substances where
the diamagnetic behaviour is the strongest effect are termed diamagnetic
materials, or diamagnets. Diamagnetic materials are those that laypeople
generally think of as non-magnetic, and include water, wood, most organic
compounds such as petroleum and some plastics, and many metals including
copper, particularly the heavy ones with many core_electrons, such as mercury,
gold and bismuth. The magnetic susceptibility values of various molecular
fragments are called Pascal's_constants.
Diamagnetic materials, like water, or water-based materials, have a relative
magnetic permeability that is less than or equal to 1, and therefore a magnetic
susceptibility less than or equal to 0, since susceptibility is defined as Ïv
= Î¼v â 1. This means that diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic
fields. However, since diamagnetism is such a weak property, its effects are
not observable in everyday life. For example, the magnetic susceptibility of
diamagnets such as water is Ïv = â9.05Ã10â6. The most strongly
diamagnetic material is bismuth, Ïv = â1.66Ã10â4, although pyrolytic
carbon may have a susceptibility of Ïv = â4.00Ã10â4 in one plane.
Nevertheless, these values are orders of magnitude smaller than the magnetism
exhibited by paramagnets and ferromagnets. Note that because Ïv is derived
from the ratio of the internal magnetic field to the applied field, it is a
dimensionless value.
In rare cases, the diamagnetic contribution can be stronger than paramagnetic
contribution. As is the case for gold, which has a magnetic susceptibility less
than 0, so is by definition a diamagnetic material, but when measured carefully
with X-ray_magnetic_circular_dichroism, shows an extremely weak paramagnetic
contribution that is overcome by a stronger diamagnetic contribution.[4]
**** Superconductors[edit] ****
Transition from ordinary conductivity (left) to superconductivity (right). At
the transition, the superconductor expels the magnetic field and then acts as a
perfect diamagnet.
Superconductors may be considered perfect_diamagnets (Ïv = â1), because they
expel all magnetic fields (except in a thin surface layer) due to the Meissner
effect.[5]
***** Demonstrations[edit] *****
**** Curving water surfaces[edit] ****
If a powerful magnet (such as a supermagnet) is covered with a layer of water
(that is thin compared to the diameter of the magnet) then the field of the
magnet significantly repels the water. This causes a slight dimple in the
water's surface that may be seen by its reflection.[6][7]
**** Levitation[edit] ****
Main article: Magnetic_levitation_Â§ Diamagnetic_levitation
A live frog levitates inside a 32 mm (1.26 in) diameter vertical bore of a
Bitter_solenoid in a magnetic field of about 16 teslas at the Nijmegen_High
Field_Magnet_Laboratory.[8]
Diamagnets may be levitated in stable equilibrium in a magnetic field, with no
power consumption. Earnshaw's_theorem seems to preclude the possibility of
static magnetic levitation. However, Earnshaw's theorem applies only to objects
with positive susceptibilities, such as ferromagnets (which have a permanent
positive moment) and paramagnets (which induce a positive moment). These are
attracted to field maxima, which do not exist in free space. Diamagnets (which
induce a negative moment) are attracted to field minima, and there can be a
field minimum in free space.
A thin slice of pyrolytic_graphite, which is an unusually strong diamagnetic
material, can be stably floated in a magnetic field, such as that from rare
earth permanent magnets. This can be done with all components at room
temperature, making a visually effective demonstration of diamagnetism.
The Radboud_University_Nijmegen, the Netherlands, has conducted experiments
where water and other substances were successfully levitated. Most
spectacularly, a live frog (see figure) was levitated.[9]
In September 2009, NASA's Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena,
California announced it had successfully levitated mice using a superconducting
magnet,[10] an important step forward since mice are closer biologically to
humans than frogs.[11] JPL said it hopes to perform experiments regarding the
effects of microgravity on bone and muscle mass.
Recent experiments studying the growth of protein crystals have led to a
technique using powerful magnets to allow growth in ways that counteract
Earth's gravity.[12]
A simple homemade device for demonstration can be constructed out of bismuth
plates and a few permanent magnets that levitate a permanent magnet.[13]
***** Theory[edit] *****
The electrons in a material generally settle in orbitals, with effectively zero
resistance and act like current loops. Thus it might be imagined that
diamagnetism effects in general would be common, since any applied magnetic
field would generate currents in these loops that would oppose the change, in a
similar way to superconductors, which are essentially perfect diamagnets.
However, since the electrons are rigidly held in orbitals by the charge of the
protons and are further constrained by the Pauli_exclusion_principle, many
materials exhibit diamagnetism, but typically respond very little to the
applied field.
The Bohrâvan_Leeuwen_theorem proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or
paramagnetism in a purely classical system. However, the classical theory of
Langevin for diamagnetism gives the same prediction as the quantum theory.[14]
The classical theory is given below.
**** Langevin diamagnetism[edit] ****
Paul_Langevin's theory of diamagnetism (1905)[15] applies to materials
containing atoms with closed shells (see dielectrics). A field with intensity
B, applied to an electron with charge e and mass m, gives rise to Larmor
precession with frequency ω = eB / 2m. The number of revolutions per unit time
is ω / 2Ï, so the current for an atom with Z electrons is (in SI_units)[14]
         I = &#x2212;    Z  e  2   B   4 &#x03C0; m    .   {\displaystyle I=-
      {\frac {Ze^{2}B}{4\pi m}}.}  [ I = -\frac{Ze^2B}{4 \pi m}.]
The magnetic_moment of a current loop is equal to the current times the area of
the loop. Suppose the field is aligned with the z axis. The average loop area
can be given as      &#x03C0;  &#x27E8;  &#x03C1;  2   &#x27E9;
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \pi \left\langle \rho ^{2}\right\rangle }
[\scriptstyle  \pi\left\langle\rho^2\right\rangle], where       &#x27E8;
&#x03C1;  2   &#x27E9;     {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \left\langle \rho ^
{2}\right\rangle }  [\scriptstyle \left\langle\rho^2\right\rangle] is the mean
square distance of the electrons perpendicular to the z axis. The magnetic
moment is therefore
         &#x03BC; = &#x2212;    Z  e  2   B   4 m    &#x27E8;  &#x03C1;  2
      &#x27E9; .   {\displaystyle \mu =-{\frac {Ze^{2}B}{4m}}\langle \rho ^
      {2}\rangle .}  [ \mu = -\frac{Ze^2B}{4 m}\langle\rho^2\rangle.]
If the distribution of charge is spherically symmetric, we can suppose that the
distribution of x,y,z coordinates are independent_and_identically_distributed.
Then       &#x27E8;  x  2   &#x27E9;   =   &#x27E8;  y  2   &#x27E9;   =
&#x27E8;  z  2   &#x27E9;   =    1 3    &#x27E8;  r  2   &#x27E9;
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle \;=\;\left\langle
y^{2}\right\rangle \;=\;\left\langle z^{2}\right\rangle \;=\;{\frac {1}
{3}}\left\langle r^{2}\right\rangle }  [\scriptstyle \left\langle x^2
\right\rangle \;=\; \left\langle y^2 \right\rangle \;=\; \left\langle z^2
\right\rangle \;=\; \frac{1}{3}\left\langle r^2 \right\rangle], where
&#x27E8;  r  2   &#x27E9;     {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \left\langle r^
{2}\right\rangle }  [\scriptstyle \left\langle r^2 \right\rangle] is the mean
square distance of the electrons from the nucleus. Therefore,       &#x27E8;
&#x03C1;  2   &#x27E9;   =   &#x27E8;  x  2   &#x27E9;   +   &#x27E8;  y  2
&#x27E9;   =    2 3    &#x27E8;  r  2   &#x27E9;     {\displaystyle
\scriptstyle \left\langle \rho ^{2}\right\rangle \;=\;\left\langle x^
{2}\right\rangle \;+\;\left\langle y^{2}\right\rangle \;=\;{\frac {2}
{3}}\left\langle r^{2}\right\rangle }  [\scriptstyle \left\langle \rho^2
\right\rangle \;=\; \left\langle x^2\right\rangle \;+\; \left\langle y^2
\right\rangle \;=\; \frac{2}{3}\left\langle r^2 \right\rangle]. If     n
{\displaystyle n}  [n] is the number of atoms per unit volume, the volume
diamagnetic_susceptibility in SI units is
         &#x03C7; =     &#x03BC;  0   n &#x03BC;  B   = &#x2212;     &#x03BC;
      0    e  2   Z n   6 m    &#x27E8;  r  2   &#x27E9; .   {\displaystyle
      \chi ={\frac {\mu _{0}n\mu }{B}}=-{\frac {\mu _{0}e^{2}Zn}{6m}}\langle r^
      {2}\rangle .}  [{\displaystyle \chi ={\frac {\mu _{0}n\mu }{B}}=-{\frac
      {\mu _{0}e^{2}Zn}{6m}}\langle r^{2}\rangle .}]
**** In metals[edit] ****
The Langevin theory is not the full picture for metals because there are also
non-localized electrons. The theory that describes diamagnetism in a free
electron_gas is called Landau diamagnetism, named after Lev_Landau,[16] and
instead considers the weak counteracting field that forms when the electrons'
trajectories are curved due to the Lorentz_force. Landau diamagnetism, however,
should be contrasted with Pauli_paramagnetism, an effect associated with the
polarization of delocalized electrons' spins.[17][18] For the bulk case of a 3D
system and low magnetic fields, the (volume) diamagnetic susceptibility can be
calculated using Landau_quantization, which in SI units is
         &#x03C7; = &#x2212;  &#x03BC;  0      e  2    12  &#x03C0;  2   m
      &#x210F;      2 m  E   F      ,   {\displaystyle \chi =-\mu _{0}{\frac
      {e^{2}}{12\pi ^{2}m\hbar }}{\sqrt {2mE_{\rm {F}}}},}  [{\displaystyle
      \chi =-\mu _{0}{\frac {e^{2}}{12\pi ^{2}m\hbar }}{\sqrt {2mE_{\rm
      {F}}}},}]
where      E   F      {\displaystyle E_{\rm {F}}}  [{\displaystyle E_{\rm
{F}}}] is the Fermi_energy. This is equivalent to     &#x2212;  &#x03BC;  0
&#x03BC;   B    2   g (  E   F    )  /  3   {\displaystyle -\mu _{0}\mu _{\rm
{B}}^{2}g(E_{\rm {F}})/3}  [{\displaystyle -\mu _{0}\mu _{\rm {B}}^{2}g(E_{\rm
{F}})/3}], exactly     &#x2212; 1  /  3   {\textstyle -1/3}  [{\textstyle -1/
3}] times Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility, where      &#x03BC;   B    = e
&#x210F;  /  2 m   {\displaystyle \mu _{\rm {B}}=e\hbar /2m}  [{\displaystyle
\mu _{\rm {B}}=e\hbar /2m}] is the Bohr_magneton and     g ( E )
{\displaystyle g(E)}  [g(E)] is the density_of_states (number of states per
energy per volume). This formula takes into account the spin degeneracy of the
carriers (spin Â½ electrons).
In doped_semiconductors the ratio between Landau and Pauli susceptibilities may
change due to the effective_mass of the charge carriers differing from the
electron mass in vacuum, increasing the diamagnetic contribution. The formula
presented here only applies for the bulk; in confined systems like quantum
dots, the description is altered due to quantum_confinement.[19][20]
Additionally, for strong magnetic fields, the susceptibility of delocalized
electrons oscillates as a function of the field strength, a phenomenon known as
the de_Haasâvan_Alphen_effect, also first described theoretically by Landau.
