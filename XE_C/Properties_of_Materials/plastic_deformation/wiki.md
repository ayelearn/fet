Compressive stress results in deformation which shortens the object but also
expands it outwards.
In materials_science, deformation refers to any changes in the shape or size of
an object due to
    * an applied force (the deformation energy in this case is transferred
      through work) or
    * a change in temperature (the deformation energy in this case is
      transferred through heat).
The first case can be a result of tensile (pulling) forces, compressive
(pushing) forces, shear, bending or torsion (twisting).
In the second case, the most significant factor, which is determined by the
temperature, is the mobility of the structural defects such as grain
boundaries, point vacancies, line and screw dislocations, stacking faults and
twins in both crystalline and non-crystalline solids. The movement or
displacement of such mobile defects is thermally activated, and thus limited by
the rate of atomic diffusion.[1][2]
Deformation is often described as strain.
The concept of deformation is also linked to the study of the stability of an
elastic material by using the method of incremental_deformations, based on a
superposed small deformation on an equilibrium solution.
As deformation occurs, internal inter-molecular forces arise that oppose the
applied force. If the applied force is not too great, these forces may be
sufficient to completely resist the applied force and allow the object to
assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original state when the
load is removed. A larger applied force may lead to a permanent deformation of
the object or even to its structural_failure.
In the figure it can be seen that the compressive loading (indicated by the
arrow) has caused deformation in the cylinder so that the original shape
(dashed lines) has changed (deformed) into one with bulging sides. The sides
bulge because the material, although strong enough to not crack or otherwise
fail, is not strong enough to support the load without change. As a result, the
material is forced out laterally. Internal forces (in this case at right angles
to the deformation) resist the applied load.
The concept of a rigid_body can be applied if the deformation is negligible.

***** Types of deformation[edit] *****
Depending on the type of material, size and geometry of the object, and the
forces applied, various types of deformation may result. The image to the right
shows the engineering stress vs. strain diagram for a typical ductile material
such as steel. Different deformation modes may occur under different
conditions, as can be depicted using a deformation_mechanism_map.
Permanent deformation is irreversible; the deformation stays even after removal
of the applied forces, while the temporary deformation is recoverable as it
disappears after the removal of applied forces. Temporary deformation is also
called elastic deformation, while the permanent deformation is called plastic
deformation.

**** Elastic deformation[edit] ****
Further information: Elasticity_(physics)
The study of temporary or elastic deformation in the case of engineering_strain
is applied to materials used in mechanical and structural engineering, such as
concrete and steel, which are subjected to very small deformations. Engineering
strain is modeled by infinitesimal_strain_theory, also called small strain
theory, small deformation theory, small displacement theory, or small
displacement-gradient theory where strains and rotations are both small.
For some materials, e.g. elastomers and polymers, subjected to large
deformations, the engineering definition of strain is not applicable, e.g.
typical engineering strains greater than 1%,[3] thus other more complex
definitions of strain are required, such as stretch, logarithmic strain, Green
strain, and Almansi strain. Elastomers and shape_memory metals such as Nitinol
exhibit large elastic deformation ranges, as does rubber. However, elasticity
is nonlinear in these materials.
Normal metals, ceramics and most crystals show linear elasticity and a smaller
elastic range.
Linear elastic deformation is governed by Hooke's_law, which states:
         &#x03C3; = E &#x03B5;   {\displaystyle \sigma =E\varepsilon }  [\sigma
      = E \varepsilon]
Where     &#x03C3;   {\displaystyle \sigma }  [\sigma ] is the applied stress,
E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] is a material constant called Young's_modulus or
elastic_modulus, and Îµ is the resulting strain. This relationship only applies
in the elastic range and indicates that the slope of the stress vs. strain
curve can be used to find Young's modulus (    E   {\displaystyle E}  [E]).
Engineers often use this calculation in tensile tests.
Note that not all elastic materials undergo linear elastic deformation; some,
such as concrete, gray_cast_iron, and many polymers, respond in a nonlinear
fashion. For these materials Hooke's law is inapplicable.[4]

**** True stress and strain[edit] ****
Since we disregard the change of area during deformation above, the true stress
and strain curve should be re-derived. For deriving the stress strain curve, we
can assume that the volume change is 0 even if we deformed the materials. We
can assume that:
    A  i   &#x00D7;  &#x03B5;  i   =  A  f   &#x00D7;  &#x03B5;  f
{\displaystyle A_{i}\times \varepsilon _{i}=A_{f}\times \varepsilon _{f}}  [
{\displaystyle A_{i}\times \varepsilon _{i}=A_{f}\times \varepsilon _{f}}]
Then, the true stress can be expressed as below:     &#x03C3;  T   = F  /   A
f   = F  /   A  i   &#x00D7;  A  i    /   A  f   =  &#x03C3;  e   &#x00D7;  l
f    /   l  i   =  &#x03C3;  E   &#x00D7; (  l  i   + &#x03B4; l )  /   l  i
=  &#x03C3;  E   ( 1 +  &#x03B5;  E   )   {\displaystyle \sigma _{T}=F/A_{f}=F/
A_{i}\times A_{i}/A_{f}=\sigma _{e}\times l_{f}/l_{i}=\sigma _{E}\times (l_
{i}+\delta l)/l_{i}=\sigma _{E}(1+\varepsilon _{E})}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _
{T}=F/A_{f}=F/A_{i}\times A_{i}/A_{f}=\sigma _{e}\times l_{f}/l_{i}=\sigma _
{E}\times (l_{i}+\delta l)/l_{i}=\sigma _{E}(1+\varepsilon _{E})}]
Additionally, the true strain ÎµT can be express as below:
    &#x03B5;  T   = &#x03B4; l  /   l  0   + &#x03B4; l  /   l  1   + &#x03B4;
l  /   l  2   + &#x22C5; &#x22C5; &#x22C5; = &#x03A3; &#x03B4; l  /   l  i
{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{T}=\delta l/l_{0}+\delta l/l_{1}+\delta l/l_
{2}+\cdot \cdot \cdot =\Sigma \delta l/l_{i}}  [{\displaystyle \varepsilon _
{T}=\delta l/l_{0}+\delta l/l_{1}+\delta l/l_{2}+\cdot \cdot \cdot =\Sigma
\delta l/l_{i}}]
Then, we can express the value as      &#x222B;   l  0      l  i     d l  /  l
d x = ln &#x2061; (  l  i    /   l  0   ) = l n ( 1 +  &#x03B5;  E   )
{\displaystyle \int _{l_{0}}^{l_{i}}dl/l\,dx=\ln(l_{i}/l_{0})=ln(1+\varepsilon
_{E})}  [{\displaystyle \int _{l_{0}}^{l_{i}}dl/l\,dx=\ln(l_{i}/l_{0})=ln
(1+\varepsilon _{E})}]
Thus, we can induce the plot in terms of      &#x03C3;  T     {\displaystyle
\sigma _{T}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{T}}] and      &#x03B5;  E
{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{E}}  [{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{E}}] as right
figure.
Additionally, based on the true stress-strain curve, we can estimate the region
where necking starts to happen. Since necking starts to appear after ultimate
tensile stress where the maximum force applied, we can express this situation
as below:
   d F = 0 =  &#x03C3;  T   d  A  i   +  A  i   d  &#x03C3;  T
{\displaystyle dF=0=\sigma _{T}dA_{i}+A_{i}d\sigma _{T}}  [{\displaystyle
dF=0=\sigma _{T}dA_{i}+A_{i}d\sigma _{T}}]
so this form can be expressed as below:
      d  &#x03C3;  T     &#x03C3;  T     = &#x2212;    d  A  i     A  i
{\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma _{T}}{\sigma _{T}}}=-{\frac {dA_{i}}{A_{i}}}}  [
{\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma _{T}}{\sigma _{T}}}=-{\frac {dA_{i}}{A_{i}}}}]
It indicates that the necking starts to appear where reduction of area becomes
much significant compared to the stress change. Then the stress will be
localized to specific area where the necking appears.
Additionally, we can induce various relation based on true stress-strain curve.
1) True strain and stress curve can be expressed by the approximate linear
relationship by taking a log on true stress and strain. The relation can be
expressed as below:
    &#x03C3;  T   = K &#x00D7; (  &#x03B5;  T    )  n     {\displaystyle \sigma
_{T}=K\times (\varepsilon _{T})^{n}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{T}=K\times
(\varepsilon _{T})^{n}}]
Where     K   {\displaystyle K}  [K] is stress coefficient and     n
{\displaystyle n}  [n] is strain-hardening coefficient. Usually, the value of
n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] has range around 0.02 to 0.5 at room temperature. If
n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] is 1, we can express this material as perfect
elastic material.[5][6]
2) In reality, stress is also highly dependent on the rate of strain variation.
Thus, we can induce the empirical equation based on the strain rate variation.
    &#x03C3;  T   =  K &#x2032;  &#x00D7; (     &#x03B5;  T   &#x02D9;     )  m
{\displaystyle \sigma _{T}=K'\times ({\dot {\varepsilon _{T}}})^{m}}  [
{\displaystyle \sigma _{T}=K'\times ({\dot {\varepsilon _{T}}})^{m}}]
True stress-strain curve of FCC metal and its derivative form[5]
Where      K &#x2032;    {\displaystyle K'}  [K'] is constant related to the
material flow stress.         &#x03B5;  T   &#x02D9;      {\displaystyle {\dot
{\varepsilon _{T}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\dot {\varepsilon _{T}}}}] indicates the
derivative of strain by the time, which is also known as strain rate.     m
{\displaystyle m}  [m] is the strain-rate sensitivity. Moreover, value of     m
{\displaystyle m}  [m] is related to the resistance toward the necking.
Usually, the value of     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] is at the range of 0-0.1
at room temperature and as high as 0.8 when the temperature is increased.
By combining the 1) and 2), we can create the ultimate relation as below:
    &#x03C3;  T   =  K &#x2033;  &#x00D7; (  &#x03B5;  T    )  n
(     &#x03B5;  T   &#x02D9;     )  m     {\displaystyle \sigma _{T}=K''\times
(\varepsilon _{T})^{n}({\dot {\varepsilon _{T}}})^{m}}  [{\displaystyle \sigma
_{T}=K''\times (\varepsilon _{T})^{n}({\dot {\varepsilon _{T}}})^{m}}]
Where      K &#x2033;    {\displaystyle K''}  [K'']is the global constant for
relating strain, strain rate and stress.
3) Based on the true stress-strain curve and its derivative form, we can
estimate the strain necessary to start necking. This can be calculated based on
the intersection between true stress-strain curve as shown in right.
This figure also shows the dependency of the necking strain at different
temperature. In case of FCC metals, both of the stress-strain curve at its
derivative are highly dependent on temperature. Therefore, at higher
temperature, necking starts to appear even under lower strain value.
All of these properties indicate the importance of calculating the true stress-
strain curve for further analyzing the behavior of materials in sudden
environment.
4) A graphical method, so-called "Considere construction", can help determine
the behavior of stress-strain curve whether necking or drawing happens on the
sample. By setting     &#x03BB; = L  /   L  0     {\displaystyle \lambda =L/L_
{0}}  [{\displaystyle \lambda =L/L_{0}}]as determinant, the true stress and
strain can be expressed with engineering stress and strain as below:
    &#x03C3;  T   =  &#x03C3;  e   &#x00D7; &#x03BB; ,  &#x03B5;  T   = l n
&#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \sigma _{T}=\sigma _{e}\times \lambda ,\varepsilon _
{T}=ln\lambda }  [{\displaystyle \sigma _{T}=\sigma _{e}\times \lambda
,\varepsilon _{T}=ln\lambda }]
Therefore, the value of engineering stress can be expressed by the secant line
from made by true stress and     &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda
] value where     &#x03BB; = 0   {\displaystyle \lambda =0}  [\lambda =0] to
&#x03BB; = 1   {\displaystyle \lambda =1}  [\lambda =1]. By analyzing the shape
of      &#x03C3;  T   &#x2212; &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \sigma _{T}-\lambda }
[{\displaystyle \sigma _{T}-\lambda }] diagram and secant line, we can
determine whether the materials show drawing or necking.
Considere Plot. (a) True stress-strain curve without tangents. There is neither
necking nor drawing. (b) With one tangent. There is only necking. (c) With two
tangents. There are both necking and drawing.[7]
On the figure (a), there is only concave upward Considere plot. It indicates
that there is no yield drop so the material will be suffered from fracture
before it yields. On the figure (b), there is specific point where the tangent
matches with secant line at point where     &#x03BB; =  &#x03BB;  Y
{\displaystyle \lambda =\lambda _{Y}}  [{\displaystyle \lambda =\lambda _{Y}}].
After this value, the slope becomes smaller than the secant line where necking
starts to appear. On the figure (c), there is point where yielding starts to
appear but when     &#x03BB; =  &#x03BB;  d     {\displaystyle \lambda =\lambda
_{d}}  [{\displaystyle \lambda =\lambda _{d}}], the drawing happens. After
drawing, all the material will stretch and eventually show fracture. Between
&#x03BB;  Y     {\displaystyle \lambda _{Y}}  [{\displaystyle \lambda _{Y}}]
and      &#x03BB;  d     {\displaystyle \lambda _{d}}  [\lambda _{d}], the
material itself does not stretch but rather, only the neck starts to stretch
out.
**** Plastic deformation[edit] ****
See also: Plasticity_(physics)
Swebor-brand high-strength low alloy steel plate, showing both sides, after
plastic deformation from defeating projectiles in ballistics testing. Note:
When exposed to fire, steel first expands and then loses its strength,
exceeding critical temperature at 538Â°C or 1000Â°F per ASTM_E119 unless
treated with fireproofing.
This type of deformation is not undone simply by removing the applied force. An
object in the plastic deformation range, however, will first have undergone
elastic deformation, which is undone simply be removing the applied force, so
the object will return part way to its original shape. Soft thermoplastics have
a rather large plastic deformation range as do ductile metals such as copper,
silver, and gold. Steel does, too, but not cast_iron. Hard thermosetting
plastics, rubber, crystals, and ceramics have minimal plastic deformation
ranges. An example of a material with a large plastic deformation range is wet
chewing_gum, which can be stretched dozens of times its original length.
Under tensile stress, plastic deformation is characterized by a strain
hardening region and a necking region and finally, fracture (also called
rupture). During strain hardening the material becomes stronger through the
movement of atomic_dislocations. The necking phase is indicated by a reduction
in cross-sectional area of the specimen. Necking begins after the ultimate
strength is reached. During necking, the material can no longer withstand the
maximum stress and the strain in the specimen rapidly increases. Plastic
deformation ends with the fracture of the material.
*** Metal fatigue[edit] ***
Another deformation mechanism is metal_fatigue, which occurs primarily in
ductile metals. It was originally thought that a material deformed only within
the elastic range returned completely to its original state once the forces
were removed. However, faults are introduced at the molecular level with each
deformation. After many deformations, cracks will begin to appear, followed
soon after by a fracture, with no apparent plastic deformation in between.
Depending on the material, shape, and how close to the elastic limit it is
deformed, failure may require thousands, millions, billions, or trillions of
deformations.
Metal fatigue has been a major cause of aircraft failure, especially before the
process was well understood (see, for example, the De_Havilland_Comet
accidents). There are two ways to determine when a part is in danger of metal
fatigue; either predict when failure will occur due to the material/force/
shape/iteration combination, and replace the vulnerable materials before this
occurs, or perform inspections to detect the microscopic cracks and perform
replacement once they occur. Selection of materials not likely to suffer from
metal fatigue during the life of the product is the best solution, but not
always possible. Avoiding shapes with sharp corners limits metal fatigue by
reducing stress concentrations, but does not eliminate it.
Analysis of the bulging_factor of pressurized parts of the plane can assist in
evaluating the damage tolerance of airframe fuselages.[8]

(force applied) and strain (deformation) of a ductile metal.
*** Compressive failure[edit] ***
Usually, compressive stress applied to bars, columns, etc. leads to shortening.
Loading a structural element or specimen will increase the compressive stress
until it reaches its compressive_strength. According to the properties of the
material, failure modes are yielding for materials with ductile behavior (most
metals, some soils and plastics) or rupturing for brittle behavior
(geomaterials, cast_iron, glass, etc.).
In long, slender structural elements â such as columns or truss bars â an
increase of compressive force F leads to structural_failure due to buckling at
lower stress than the compressive strength.
**** Fracture[edit] ****
See also: Concrete_fracture_analysis and Fracture_mechanics
This type of deformation is also irreversible. A break occurs after the
material has reached the end of the elastic, and then plastic, deformation
ranges. At this point forces accumulate until they are sufficient to cause a
fracture. All materials will eventually fracture, if sufficient forces are
applied.
***** Misconceptions[edit] *****
A popular misconception is that all materials that bend are "weak" and those
that don't are "strong". In reality, many materials that undergo large elastic
and plastic deformations, such as steel, are able to absorb stresses that would
cause brittle materials, such as glass, with minimal plastic deformation
ranges, to break.[9]
