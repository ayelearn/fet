A ceramic (Ancient_Greek: ÎºÎµÏÎ±Î¼Î¹ÎºÏÏ â keramikÃ³s, "potter's", from
ÎºÎ­ÏÎ±Î¼Î¿Ï â kÃ©ramos, "potter's clay") is a solid material comprising an
inorganic_compound of metal, non-metal or metalloid atoms primarily held in
ionic and covalent bonds. Common examples are earthenware, porcelain, and
brick.
Unidirectional Ice-Templating
The crystallinity of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-
crystalline, vitrified, and often completely amorphous (e.g., glasses). Most
often, fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi-vitrified as is the case
with earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Varying crystallinity and electron
composition in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be
good thermal and electrical_insulators (extensively researched in ceramic
engineering). With such a large range of possible options for the composition/
structure of a ceramic (e.g. nearly all of the elements, nearly all types of
bonding, and all levels of crystallinity), the breadth of the subject is vast,
and identifiable attributes (e.g. hardness, toughness, electrical_conductivity,
etc.) are difficult to specify for the group as a whole. General properties
such as high melting temperature, high hardness, poor conductivity, high moduli
of_elasticity, chemical resistance and low ductility are the norm,[1] with
known exceptions to each of these rules (e.g. piezoelectric_ceramics, glass
transition temperature, superconductive_ceramics, etc.). Many composites, such
as fiberglass and carbon_fiber, while containing ceramic materials, are not
considered to be part of the ceramic family.[2]
The earliest ceramics made by humans were pottery objects (i.e. pots or
vessels) or figurines made from clay, either by itself or mixed with other
materials like silica, hardened and sintered in fire. Later ceramics were
glazed and fired to create smooth, colored surfaces, decreasing porosity
through the use of glassy, amorphous ceramic coatings on top of the crystalline
ceramic substrates.[3] Ceramics now include domestic, industrial and building
products, as well as a wide range of ceramic_art. In the 20th century, new
ceramic_materials were developed for use in advanced ceramic engineering, such
as in semiconductors.
The word "ceramic" comes from the Greek word ÎºÎµÏÎ±Î¼Î¹ÎºÏÏ (keramikos),
"of pottery" or "for pottery",[4] from ÎºÎ­ÏÎ±Î¼Î¿Ï (keramos), "potter's
clay, tile, pottery".[5] The earliest known mention of the root "ceram-" is the
Mycenaean_Greek ke-ra-me-we, "workers of ceramics", written in Linear_B
syllabic script.[6] The word "ceramic" may be used as an adjective to describe
a material, product or process, or it may be used as a noun, either singular,
or, more commonly, as the plural noun "ceramics".[7]

A low magnification SEM_micrograph of an advanced ceramic material. The
properties of ceramics make fracturing an important inspection method.
A ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide,
nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as carbon or silicon, may be
considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in
compression, and weak in shearing and tension. They withstand chemical erosion
that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments.
Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, ranging from 1,000 Â°C
to 1,600 Â°C (1,800 Â°F to 3,000 Â°F). Glass is often not considered a ceramic
because of its amorphous (noncrystalline) character. However, glassmaking
involves several steps of the ceramic process, and its mechanical properties
are similar to ceramic materials.
Traditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as kaolinite,
whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide, more commonly known as
alumina. The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced
ceramics, include silicon_carbide and tungsten_carbide. Both are valued for
their abrasion resistance and hence find use in applications such as the wear
plates of crushing equipment in mining operations. Advanced ceramics are also
used in the medicine, electrical, electronics industries and body armor.
**** Crystalline ceramics[edit] ****
Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing.
Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories â
either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction in situ, or by
"forming" powders into the desired shape, and then sintering to form a solid
body. Ceramic_forming_techniques include shaping by hand (sometimes including a
rotation process called "throwing"), slip_casting, tape_casting (used for
making very thin ceramic capacitors), injection_molding, dry pressing, and
other variations.
**** Noncrystalline ceramics[edit] ****
Noncrystalline ceramics, being glass, tend to be formed from melts. The glass
is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-
like viscosity, by methods such as blowing into a mold. If later heat
treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline, the resulting
material is known as a glass-ceramic, widely used as cook-tops and also as a
glass composite material for nuclear waste disposal.
***** Properties[edit] *****
The physical properties of any ceramic substance are a direct result of its
crystalline structure and chemical composition. Solid-state_chemistry reveals
the fundamental connection between microstructure and properties such as
localized density variations, grain size distribution, type of porosity and
second-phase content, which can all be correlated with ceramic properties such
as mechanical strength Ï by the Hall-Petch equation, hardness, toughness,
dielectric_constant, and the optical properties exhibited by transparent
materials.
Ceramography is the art and science of preparation, examination and evaluation
of ceramic microstructures. Evaluation and characterization of ceramic
microstructures is often implemented on similar spatial scales to that used
commonly in the emerging field of nanotechnology: from tens of angstroms (A) to
tens of micrometers (Âµm). This is typically somewhere between the minimum
wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye.
The microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, grain boundaries,
pores, micro-cracks, structural defects and hardness microindentions. Most bulk
mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties are
significantly affected by the observed microstructure. The fabrication method
and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure. The root
cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the cleaved and polished
microstructure. Physical properties which constitute the field of materials
science and engineering include the following:
**** Mechanical properties[edit] ****

Mechanical properties are important in structural and building materials as
well as textile fabrics. In modern materials_science, fracture mechanics is an
important tool in improving the mechanical performance of materials and
components. It applies the physics of stress and strain, in particular the
theories of elasticity and plasticity, to the microscopic crystallographic
defects found in real materials in order to predict the macroscopic mechanical
failure of bodies. Fractography is widely used with fracture mechanics to
understand the causes of failures and also verify the theoretical failure
predictions with real life failures.
Ceramic materials are usually ionic or covalent bonded materials, and can be
crystalline or amorphous. A material held together by either type of bond will
tend to fracture before any plastic_deformation takes place, which results in
poor toughness in these materials. Additionally, because these materials tend
to be porous, the pores and other microscopic imperfections act as stress
concentrators, decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the tensile
strength. These combine to give catastrophic_failures, as opposed to the more
ductile failure_modes of metals.
These materials do show plastic_deformation. However, because of the rigid
structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available slip
systems for dislocations to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-
crystalline (glassy) materials, viscous flow is the dominant source of plastic
deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many
applications of ceramic materials.
To overcome the brittle behaviour, ceramic material development has introduced
the class of ceramic_matrix_composite materials, in which ceramic fibers are
embedded and with specific coatings are forming fiber bridges across any crack.
This mechanism substantially increases the fracture toughness of such ceramics.
Ceramic disc_brakes are an example of using a ceramic matrix composite material
manufactured with a specific process.
*** Ice-Templating for Enhanced Mechanical Properties[edit] ***
Often times if a ceramic will be subjected to substantial mechanical loading it
will undergo a process called Ice-templating. This process allows the finite
control of the microstructure of the ceramic material and therefore the control
of the mechanical properties. Ceramic engineers use this technique to tune the
mechanical properties to their desired application. Specifically, Strength is
increased when this technique is employed. Ice templating allows one to create
macroscopic pores in a unidirectional arrangement. The applications of this
oxide strengthening technique are important for solid_oxide_fuel_cells and also
water_filtration devices.
In order to process a sample through ice templating a few steps are required to
be completed by the ceramicist. First an aqueous colloidal_suspension must be
prepared containing the dissolved ceramic powder, say Yttria_Stablized_Zirconia
(YSZ). After the ceramic precursor is ensured to be evenly dispersed throughout
the colloidal solution then next processing step may begin. At this point we
have a pure solution containing our YSZ dissolved powder and aqueous water in
the liquid state. The solution is then cooled on a platform that allows for
unidirectional cooling like the one shown in the animation to the right. The
solution sample of YSZ is cooled from the bottom to the top in a unidirectional
fashion. This forces ice crystals to grow in compliance to the unidirectional
cooling. Inside the solution, as it is cooling, these ice crystals force the
dissolved YSZ particles to the solidification front of the solid-liquid
interphase boundary. At this stage of the process we have pure ice crystals
lined up in a unidirectional fashion alongside concentrated pockets of the YSZ
colloidal particles. The next step of the process is the sublimation step. The
sample is simultaneously heated and the pressure is reduced enough to force to
ice crystals to subliminate, since the sample is also heated the YSZ pockets
begin to anneal together too form the first macroscopically aligned ceramic
microstuctures. The sample is then further sintered to confirm the evaporation
of the residual water and the final consolidation of the ceramic
microstructure.
During the execution of this technique a few variables can be controlled to
influence the pore size and morphology of the microstructure. These important
variables of the ice-templating technique are namely the initial solids loading
of the colloid, the cooling rate, the sintering temperature and time length,
and also it has been shown that certain additives can influence the micro-
structural morphology during this process. A good understanding of these
parameters is essential to understanding the relationships between processing,
microstructure, and mechanical properties of anisotropically porous materials.

**** Electrical properties[edit] ****
*** Semiconductors[edit] ***
Some ceramics are semiconductors. Most of these are transition_metal_oxides
that are II-VI semiconductors, such as zinc_oxide.
While there are prospects of mass-producing blue LEDs from zinc oxide,
ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show grain
boundary effects.
One of the most widely used of these is the varistor. These are devices that
exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold
voltage. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a
breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries,
which results in its electrical_resistance dropping from several megohms down
to a few hundred ohms. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate
a lot of energy, and they self-reset â after the voltage across the device
drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high.
This makes them ideal for surge-protection applications; as there is control
over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of
applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in
electrical_substations, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure
from lightning strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do
not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this
application.
Semiconducting ceramics are also employed as gas_sensors. When various gases
are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes.
With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very inexpensive devices can be
produced.
*** Superconductivity[edit] ***

superconductor, which is cooled by liquid_nitrogen
Under some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics exhibit
high-temperature_superconductivity. The reason for this is not understood, but
there are two major families of superconducting ceramics.
*** Ferroelectricity and supersets[edit] ***
Piezoelectricity, a link between electrical and mechanical response, is
exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to
measure_time in watches and other electronics. Such devices use both properties
of piezoelectrics, using electricity to produce a mechanical motion (powering
the device) and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity
(generating a signal). The unit of time measured is the natural interval
required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again.
The piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit
pyroelectricity, and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. These
materials can be used to inter convert between thermal, mechanical, or
electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric
crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static
charge of thousands of volts. Such materials are used in motion_sensors, where
the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to
produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.
In turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display
the ferroelectric_effect, in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or
reversed by applying an electrostatic field. Pyroelectricity is also a
necessary consequence of ferroelectricity. This can be used to store
information in ferroelectric_capacitors, elements of ferroelectric_RAM.
The most common such materials are lead_zirconate_titanate and barium_titanate.
Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is
exploited in the design of high-frequency loudspeakers, transducers for sonar,
and actuators for atomic_force and scanning_tunneling_microscopes.
*** Positive thermal coefficient[edit] ***

tested with H2/O2 propellants
Increases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become
insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of heavy
metal titanates. The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a
wide range by variations in chemistry. In such materials, current will pass
through the material until joule_heating brings it to the transition
temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will
cease. Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for
example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.
At the transition temperature, the material's dielectric response becomes
theoretically infinite. While a lack of temperature control would rule out any
practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric
effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures. Titanates
with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous
with "ceramic" in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.
**** Optical properties[edit] ****

Optically_transparent_materials focus on the response of a material to incoming
lightwaves of a range of wavelengths. Frequency_selective_optical_filters can
be utilized to alter or enhance the brightness and contrast of a digital image.
Guided lightwave transmission via frequency selective waveguides involves the
emerging field of fiber optics and the ability of certain glassy compositions
as a transmission_medium for a range of frequencies simultaneously (multi-mode
optical_fiber) with little or no interference between competing wavelengths or
frequencies. This resonant mode of energy and data_transmission via
electromagnetic (light) wave_propagation, though low powered, is virtually
lossless. Optical waveguides are used as components in Integrated_optical
circuits (e.g. light-emitting_diodes, LEDs) or as the transmission medium in
local and long haul optical_communication systems. Also of value to the
emerging materials scientist is the sensitivity of materials to radiation in
the thermal infrared (IR) portion of the electromagnetic_spectrum. This heat-
seeking ability is responsible for such diverse optical phenomena as Night-
vision and IR luminescence.
Thus, there is an increasing need in the military sector for high-strength,
robust materials which have the capability to transmit light (electromagnetic
waves) in the visible (0.4 â 0.7 micrometers) and mid-infrared (1 â 5
micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for
applications requiring transparent armor, including next-generation high-speed
missiles and pods, as well as protection against improvised explosive devices
(IED).
In the 1960s, scientists at General Electric (GE) discovered that under the
right manufacturing conditions, some ceramics, especially aluminium_oxide
(alumina), could be made translucent. These translucent materials were
transparent enough to be used for containing the electrical plasma generated in
high-pressure sodium street lamps. During the past two decades, additional
types of transparent ceramics have been developed for applications such as nose
cones for heat-seeking missiles, windows for fighter aircraft, and
scintillation_counters for computed tomography scanners.
In the early 1970s, Thomas Soules pioneered computer modeling of light
transmission through translucent ceramic alumina. His model showed that
microscopic pores in ceramic, mainly trapped at the junctions of
microcrystalline grains, caused light to scatter and prevented true
transparency. The volume fraction of these microscopic pores had to be less
than 1% for high-quality optical transmission.
This is basically a particle_size effect. Opacity results from the incoherent
scattering of light at surfaces and interfaces. In addition to pores, most of
the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of grain
boundaries which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of
the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the
wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any
significant extent.
In the formation of polycrystalline materials (metals and ceramics) the size of
the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline
particles present in the raw material during formation (or pressing) of the
object. Moreover, the size of the grain_boundaries scales directly with
particle size. Thus a reduction of the original particle size below the
wavelength of visible_light (~ 0.5 micrometers for shortwave violet) eliminates
any light scattering, resulting in a transparent material.
Recently[when?], Japanese scientists have developed techniques to produce
ceramic parts that rival the transparency of traditional crystals (grown from a
single seed) and exceed the fracture_toughness of a single crystal.[citation
needed] In particular, scientists at the Japanese firm Konoshima Ltd., a
producer of ceramic construction materials and industrial chemicals, have been
looking for markets for their transparent ceramics.
Livermore researchers realized that these ceramics might greatly benefit high-
powered lasers used in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Programs
Directorate. In particular, a Livermore research team began to acquire advanced
transparent ceramics from Konoshima to determine if they could meet the optical
requirements needed for Livermoreâs Solid-State Heat Capacity Laser (SSHCL).
[citation_needed] Livermore researchers have also been testing applications of
these materials for applications such as advanced drivers for laser-driven
fusion power plants.

A composite_material of ceramic and metal is known as cermet.
Other ceramic materials, generally requiring greater purity in their make-up
than those above, include forms of several chemical compounds, including:
    * Barium_titanate (often mixed with strontium_titanate) displays
      ferroelectricity, meaning that its mechanical, electrical, and thermal
      responses are coupled to one another and also history-dependent. It is
      widely used in electromechanical transducers, ceramic capacitors, and
      data_storage elements. Grain_boundary conditions can create PTC effects
      in heating_elements.
    * Bismuth_strontium_calcium_copper_oxide, a high-temperature_superconductor
    * Boron_oxide is used in body armour.
    * Boron_nitride is structurally isoelectronic to carbon and takes on
      similar physical forms: a graphite-like one used as a lubricant, and a
      diamond-like one used as an abrasive.
    * Earthenware used for domestic ware such as plates and mugs.
    * Ferrite is used in the magnetic_cores of electrical transformers and
      magnetic_core_memory.
    * Lead_zirconate_titanate (PZT) was developed at the United_States National
      Bureau_of_Standards in 1954. PZT is used as an ultrasonic_transducer, as
      its piezoelectric properties greatly exceed those of Rochelle salt.[9]
    * Magnesium_diboride (MgB2) is an unconventional_superconductor.
    * Porcelain is used for a wide range of household and industrial products.
    * Sialon (Silicon_Aluminium_Oxynitride) has high strength; resistance to
      thermal shock, chemical and wear resistance, and low density. These
      ceramics are used in non-ferrous molten metal handling, weld pins and the
      chemical industry.
    * Silicon_carbide (SiC) is used as a susceptor in microwave furnaces, a
      commonly used abrasive, and as a refractory material.
    * Silicon_nitride (Si3N4) is used as an abrasive powder.
    * Steatite (magnesium silicates) is used as an electrical_insulator.
    * Titanium_carbide Used in space shuttle re-entry shields and scratchproof
      watches.
    * Uranium_oxide (UO2), used as fuel in nuclear_reactors.
    * Yttrium_barium_copper_oxide (YBa2Cu3O7âx), another high temperature
      superconductor.
    * Zinc_oxide (ZnO), which is a semiconductor, and used in the construction
      of varistors.
    * Zirconium_dioxide (zirconia), which in pure form undergoes many phase
      changes between room temperature and practical sintering temperatures,
      can be chemically "stabilized" in several different forms. Its high
      oxygen ion_conductivity recommends it for use in fuel_cells and
      automotive oxygen_sensors. In another variant, metastable structures can
      impart transformation_toughening for mechanical applications; most
      ceramic_knife blades are made of this material.
    * Partially stabilised zirconia (PSZ) is much less brittle than other
      ceramics and is used for metal forming tools, valves and liners, abrasive
      slurries, kitchen knives and bearings subject to severe abrasion.[10]

***** Products[edit] *****
**** By usage[edit] ****
For convenience, ceramic products are usually divided into four main types;
these are shown below with some examples:
    * Structural, including bricks, pipes, floor and roof_tiles
    * Refractories, such as kiln linings, gas fire radiants, steel and glass
      making crucibles
    * Whitewares, including tableware, cookware, wall tiles, pottery products
      and sanitary ware[11]
    * Technical, also known as engineering, advanced, special, and fine
      ceramics. Such items include:
          o gas burner nozzles
          o ballistic_protection, vehicle_armour
          o nuclear_fuel uranium oxide pellets
          o biomedical_implants
          o coatings of jet_engine turbine blades
          o ceramic disk_brake
          o missile nose cones
          o bearing_(mechanical)
          o tiles used in the Space_Shuttle_program
**** Ceramics made with clay[edit] ****
Main article: Pottery
Frequently, the raw materials of modern ceramics do not include clays.[12]
Those that do are classified as follows:
    * Earthenware, fired at lower temperatures than other types
    * Stoneware, vitreous or semi-vitreous
    * Porcelain, which contains a high content of kaolin
    * Bone_china
**** Classification[edit] ****
Ceramics can also be classified into three distinct material categories:
    * Oxides: alumina, beryllia, ceria, zirconia
    * Non-oxides: carbide, boride, nitride, silicide
    * Composite_materials: particulate reinforced, fiber_reinforced,
      combinations of oxides and nonoxides.
Each one of these classes can be developed into unique material properties
because ceramics tend to be crystalline.
***** Applications[edit] *****
    * Knife blades: the blade of a ceramic_knife will stay sharp for much
      longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and
      susceptible to breaking.
    * Carbon-ceramic_brake_disks for vehicles are resistant to brake_fade at
      high temperatures.
    * Advanced composite_ceramic_and_metal_matrices have been designed for most
      modern armoured_fighting_vehicles because they offer superior penetrating
      resistance against shaped_charges (such as HEAT rounds) and kinetic
      energy_penetrators.
    * Ceramics such as alumina and boron_carbide have been used in ballistic
      armored_vests to repel high-velocity rifle fire. Such plates are known
      commonly as small_arms_protective_inserts, or SAPIs. Similar material is
      used to protect the cockpits of some military airplanes, because of the
      low weight of the material.
    * Ceramics can be used in place of steel for ball_bearings. Their higher
      hardness means they are much less susceptible to wear and typically last
      for triple the lifetime of a steel part. They also deform less under
      load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and
      can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from friction
      during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced
      by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and
      can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. In some
      cases, their electricity-insulating properties may also be valuable in
      bearings. Two drawbacks to ceramic bearings are a significantly higher
      cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads.
    * In the early 1980s, Toyota researched production of an adiabatic engine
      using ceramic components in the hot gas area. The ceramics would have
      allowed temperatures of over 3000 Â°F (1650 Â°C). The expected advantages
      would have been lighter materials and a smaller cooling system (or no
      need for one at all), leading to a major weight reduction. The expected
      increase of fuel_efficiency of the engine (caused by the higher
      temperature, as shown by Carnot's theorem) could not be verified
      experimentally; it was found that the heat transfer on the hot ceramic
      cylinder walls was higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall as the
      cooler gas film on the metal surface works as a thermal_insulator. Thus,
      despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not
      succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and
      the limited advantages. (Small imperfections in the ceramic material with
      its low fracture_toughness lead to cracks, which can lead to potentially
      dangerous equipment failure.) Such engines are possible in laboratory
      settings, but mass production is not feasible with current technology.
      [citation_needed]
    * Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for gas_turbine engines.
      Currently, even blades made of advanced_metal_alloys used in the engines'
      hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating
      temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more
      efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount
      of fuel.
    * Recent advances have been made in ceramics which include bioceramics,
      such as dental implants and synthetic bones. Hydroxyapatite, the natural
      mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of
      biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials.
      Orthopedic implants coated with these materials bond readily to bone and
      other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions so
      are of great interest for gene delivery and tissue_engineering scaffolds.
      Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical
      strength, and are used to coat metal orthopedic devices to aid in forming
      a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for
      orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and
      increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to
      make strong, fully dense nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials
      for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and
      plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring,
      bone mineral. Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone
      replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic
      bones.
    * Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such
      as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources
      of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to
      produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of
      radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host
      material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are
      immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on
      polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals.[13]
    * High-tech ceramic is used in watchmaking for producing watch cases. The
      material is valued by watchmakers for its light weight, scratch
      resistance, durability and smooth touch. IWC is one of the brands that
      initiated the use of ceramic in watchmaking.[14]
***** Archaeology[edit] *****
Ceramic artifacts have an important role in archaeology for understanding the
culture, technology and behavior of peoples of the past. They are among the
most common artifacts to be found at an archaeological site, generally in the
form of small fragments of broken pottery called sherds. Processing of
collected sherds can be consistent with two main types of analysis: technical
and traditional.
Traditional analysis involves sorting ceramic artifacts, sherds and larger
fragments into specific types based on style, composition, manufacturing and
morphology. By creating these typologies it is possible to distinguish between
different cultural styles, the purpose of the ceramic and technological state
of the people among other conclusions. In addition, by looking at stylistic
changes of ceramics over time is it possible to separate (seriate) the ceramics
into distinct diagnostic groups (assemblages). A comparison of ceramic
artifacts with known dated assemblages allows for a chronological assignment of
these pieces.[15]
The technical approach to ceramic analysis involves a finer examination of the
composition of ceramic artifacts and sherds to determine the source of the
material and through this the possible manufacturing site. Key criteria are the
composition of the clay and the temper used in the manufacture of the article
under study: temper is a material added to the clay during the initial
production stage, and it is used to aid the subsequent drying process. Types of
temper include shell pieces, granite fragments and ground sherd pieces called
'grog'. Temper is usually identified by microscopic examination of the temper
material. Clay identification is determined by a process of refiring the
ceramic, and assigning a color to it using Munsell Soil Color notation. By
estimating both the clay and temper compositions, and locating a region where
both are known to occur, an assignment of the material source can be made. From
the source assignment of the artifact further investigations can be made into
the site of manufacture.
