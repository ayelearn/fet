This image shows the best before date on a packaged food item, showing that the
consumer should consume the product before this time in order to reduce chance
of consuming spoiled food.
Food spoilage is the process where a food product becomes unsuitable to ingest
by the consumer. The cause of such a process is due to many outside factors as
a side-effect of the type of product it is, as well as how the product is
packaged and stored.[1] Due to food spoilage, one-third of the worlds' food
produced for the consumption of humans is lost every year.[2] Bacteria and
various fungi are the cause of spoilage and can create serious consequences for
the consumers, but there are preventative measures that can be taken.

***** Reasons[edit] *****
Harvested foods decompose from the moment they are harvested due to attacks
from enzymes, oxidation and microorganisms. These include bacteria, mold,
yeast, moisture, temperature and chemical reaction.
**** Bacteria[edit] ****
Bacteria are responsible for the spoilage of food. When bacteria breaks down
the food, acids and other waste products are created in the process.[3] While
the bacteria itself may or may not be harmful, the waste products may be
unpleasant to taste or may even be harmful to one's health.[4] There are two
types of pathogenic bacteria that target different categories of food. The
first type is called Clostridium perfingen and targets foods such as meat and
poultry, and Bacillus cereus, which targets milk and cream. When stored or
subjected to unruly conditions, the organisms will begin to breed apace,
releasing harmful toxins that can causes
severe illness, even when cooked safely.[5]
**** Fungi[edit] ****
This image shows a bowl of white rice with mold growing over it.
Fungi has been seen as a method of food spoilage, causing only an undesirable
appearance to food, however, there has been significant evidence of various
fungi being a cause of death of many people spanning across hundreds of years
in many places through the world. Fungi are caused by acidifying, fermenting,
discoloring and disintegrating processes and can create fuzz, powder and slimes
of many different colors, including black, white, red, brown and green.[6]
Mold is a type of fungus, but the two terms are not reciprocal of each other;
they have their own defining features and perform their own tasks.[7] Very well
known types of mold are Aspergillus and Penicillium, and, like regular fungi,
create a fuzz, powder and slime of various colors.[8]
Yeast is also a type of fungus that grows vegetatively via single cells that
either bud or divide by way of fission, allowing for yeast to multiply in
liquid environments favoring the dissemination of single celled microorganisms.
Yeast forms mainly in liquid environments and anaerobic conditions, but being
single celled, it oftentimes cannot spread on or into solid surfaces where
other fungus flourish. Yeast also produces at a slower rate than bacteria,
therefore being at a disadvantage in environments where bacteria are.[6] Yeasts
can be responsible for the decomposition of food with a high sugar content. The
same effect is useful in the production of various types of food and beverages,
such as bread, yogurt, cider, and alcoholic_beverages.[9]
This image depicts the process of decomposition beyond the point of human
appeal.
***** Signs[edit] *****
Signs of food spoilage may include an appearance different from the food in its
fresh form, such as a change in color, a change in texture, an unpleasant
odour, or an undesirable taste. The item may become softer than normal. If mold
occurs, it is often visible externally on the item.
***** Consequences[edit] *****
Spoilage bacteria do not normally cause "food_poisoning"; typically, the
microorganisms that cause foodborne_illnesses are odorless and flavourless, and
otherwise undetectable outside the lab.[10][11] Eating deteriorated food could
not be considered safe due to mycotoxins or microbial wastes. Some pathogenic
bacteria, such as Clostridium_perfringens and Bacillus_cereus, are capable of
causing spoilage.[12]
Issues of food spoilage do not necessarily have to do with the quality of the
food, but more so with the safety of consuming said food. However, there are
cases where food has been proven to contain toxic ingredients. 200 years ago,
Claviceps purpurea, a type of fungus, was linked to human diseases and 100
years ago in Japan, yellow rice was found to contain toxic ingredients.[13]
***** Prevention[edit] *****
A number of methods of prevention can be used that can either totally prevent,
delay, or otherwise reduce food spoilage. A food_rotation_system uses the first
in first out method (FIFO), which ensures that the first item purchased is the
first item consumed.
Preservatives can expand the shelf_life of food and can lengthen the time long
enough for it to be harvested, processed, sold, and kept in the consumer's home
for a reasonable length of time. One of the age old techniques for food
preservation, to avoid mold and fungus growth, is the process of drying out the
food or dehydrating it. While there is a chance of it developing a fungus
targeted towards dried food products, the chances are quite low.[14]
Other than drying, other methods include salting, curing, canning,
refrigeration, freezing, preservatives, irradiation, and high hydrostatic
pressure[14]: Refrigeration can increase the shelf life of certain foods and
beverages, though with most items, it does not indefinitely expand it. Freezing
can preserve food even longer, though even freezing has limitations. Canning of
food can preserve food for a particularly long period of time, whether done at
home or commercially. Canned food is vacuum_packed in order to keep oxygen,
which is needed by bacteria in aerobic spoilage, out of the can. Canning does
have limitations, and does not preserve the food indefinitely.[15] Lactic_acid
fermentation also preserves food and prevents spoilage.
Food like meat, poultry, milk and cream should be kept out of the Danger Zone
(between 40Â°F to 140Â°F). Anything between that range is considered dangerous
and can cause pathogenic toxins to be emitted, resulting in severe illness in
the consumer.[16] Another way to keep your food from spoiling is by following a
four step system: Clean, Separate, Cook, Chill. This will reduce any risks.[16]
