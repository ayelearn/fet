Liquid consisting mainly of acetic acid and water
A variety of flavored vinegars on sale in France
Vinegar is an aqueous_solution of acetic_acid and trace chemicals that may
include flavorings. Vinegar typically contains 5â20% acetic acid by volume.
Usually the acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol or sugars by
acetic_acid_bacteria.[1] There are many types of vinegar, depending upon the
source materials. Vinegar is now mainly used in the culinary_arts: as a
flavorful, acidic cooking_ingredient, or in pickling.
As the most easily manufactured mild acid, it has historically had a wide
variety of industrial and domestic_uses; such as its use as a household
cleaner.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
Fast aerobic_fermentation stainless steel vessels
In the bush the millet stalks are burnt down to make indigenous 'vinegar',
Tireli, Mali 1980
The word vinegar arrived in Middle_English from Old_French (vyn egre; 'sour
wine'), which in turn derives from Latin: vinum (wine) + acer (sour).[2]
***** Chemistry[edit] *****
The conversion of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and oxygen (O2) to acetic acid (CH3COOH)
takes place by the following reaction:[3]
      CH3CH2OH + O2 â CH3COOH + H2O
**** Polyphenols[edit] ****
Vinegar contains numerous flavonoids, phenolic_acids, and aldehydes,[4] which
vary in content depending on the source material used to make the vinegar, such
as orange_peel or various fruit_juice concentrates.[5][6]
***** History[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (February
         2018)
Vinegar was used as a condiment and for conservation by the Babylonians around
3000 BC.[7][8] Traces of it also have been found in Egyptian urns from around
3000 BC.[7]
***** Production[edit] *****
Main article: Acetic_acid_Â§ Production
Commercial vinegar is produced either by a fast or a slow fermentation process.
In general, slow methods are used in traditional vinegars, where fermentation
proceeds over the course of a few months to a year. The longer fermentation
period allows for the accumulation of a nontoxic slime composed of acetic acid
bacteria.
Fast methods add mother_of_vinegar (bacterial_culture) to the source liquid
before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast
production processes, vinegar may be produced in one to three days.
***** Varieties[edit] *****
The source materials for making vinegar are varied: different fruits, grains,
alcoholic_beverages, and other fermentable materials are used.
**** Fruit[edit] ****
Raisin vinegar
Fruit vinegars are made from fruit_wines, usually without any additional
flavoring. Common flavors of fruit vinegar include apple, blackcurrant,
raspberry, quince, and tomato. Typically, the flavors of the original fruits
remain in the final product. Most fruit vinegars are produced in Europe, where
there is a market for high-price vinegars made solely from specific fruits (as
opposed to non-fruit vinegars that are infused with fruits or fruit flavors).
[9] Several varieties are produced in Asia. Persimmon_vinegar, called gam
sikcho, is common in South_Korea. Jujube vinegar, called zaocu or hongzaocu,
and wolfberry vinegar are produced in China.
Persimmon vinegar produced in South_Korea
Apple_cider_vinegar is made from cider or apple must, and has a brownish-gold
color. It is sometimes sold unfiltered and unpasteurized with the mother_of
vinegar present. It can be diluted with fruit juice or water or sweetened
(usually with honey) for consumption.
A byproduct of commercial kiwifruit growing is a large amount of waste in the
form of misshapen or otherwise-rejected fruit (which may constitute up to 30
percent of the crop) and kiwifruit pomace. One of the uses for pomace is the
production of kiwifruit vinegar, produced commercially in New Zealand since at
least the early 1990s, and in China in 2008.[10][11]
Pomegranate vinegar is used widely in Israel as a dressing for salad, but also
in meat stew and in dips.[12] Vinegar made from raisins is used in cuisines of
the Middle East. It is cloudy and medium brown in color, with a mild flavor.
Vinegar made from dates is a traditional product of the Middle_East, and used
in Saudi_Arabia and the Gulf_countries.[13][14]
**** Palm[edit] ****
Coconut vinegar, made from fermented coconut_water or sap, is used extensively
in Southeast Asian cuisine (notably the Philippines, where it is known as
sukang_tuba), as well as in some cuisines of India and Sri_Lanka, especially
Goan_cuisine. A cloudy white liquid, it has a particularly sharp, acidic taste
with a slightly yeasty note.[15]
In the Philippines, there are other types of vinegar also made from palm sap.
Like coconut vinegar, they are by-products of tubÃ¢ (palm wine) production. The
two of the most widely produced are nipa_palm_vinegar (sukang nipa or sukang
sasa) and kaong_palm_vinegar (sukang kaong or sukang irok). Along with coconut
and cane vinegar, they are the four main traditional vinegar types in the
Philippines and are an important part of Filipino_cuisine.[16] Nipa palm
vinegar is made from the sap of the leaf stalks of nipa_palm. It has a citrusy
flavor note to it and imparts a distinctly musky aroma.[17][15] Kaong_palm
vinegar is made from the sap of flower stalks of the kaong_palm. It is sweeter
than all the other Philippine vinegar types and are commonly used in salad
dressing.[16] Vinegar from the buri_palm sap is also produced, but not the same
prevalence as coconut, nipa, and kaong vinegars.[18] Kaong palm vinegar is also
produced in Indonesia and Malaysia, though it's not as prevalent as in the
Philippines because the palm wine industry is not as widespread in these
Muslim-majority countries.[19][20]
**** Balsamic[edit] ****
Main articles: Traditional_Balsamic_Vinegar and Balsamic_vinegar
Balsamic vinegar is an aromatic aged vinegar produced in the Modena and Reggio
Emilia provinces of Italy. The original product â traditional balsamic
vinegar â is made from the concentrated juice, or must, of white Trebbiano
grapes. It is dark brown, rich, sweet, and complex, with the finest grades
being aged in successive casks made variously of oak, mulberry, chestnut,
cherry, juniper, and ash wood. Originally a costly product available to only
the Italian upper classes, traditional balsamic vinegar is marked
"tradizionale" or "DOC" to denote its Protected_Designation_of_Origin status,
and is aged for 12 to 25 years. A cheaper non-DOC commercial form described as
"aceto balsamico di Modena" (balsamic vinegar of Modena)[21] became widely
known and available around the world in the late 20th century, typically made
with concentrated grape juice mixed with a strong vinegar, then coloured and
slightly sweetened with caramel and sugar.
Balsamic vinegar is made from a grape product. It contains no balsam fruit. A
high acidity level is somewhat hidden by the sweetness of the other
ingredients, making it mellow. In terms of its nutrition content, balsamic
vinegar contains the carbohydrates of grape sugars (some 17% of total
composition), making it some 5 times higher in caloric content than typical
distilled or wine vinegar.[22]
**** Cane[edit] ****
Vinegar made from sugarcane_juice is most popular in the Philippines, in
particular in the northern Ilocos_Region (where it is called sukang Iloko or
sukang basi), although it also is produced in France and the United States. It
ranges from dark yellow to golden brown in color, and has a mellow flavor,
similar in some respects to rice vinegar, though with a somewhat "fresher"
taste. Because it contains no residual sugar, it is no sweeter than any other
vinegar. In the Philippines it often is labeled as sukang maasim (Tagalog for
"sour vinegar").
Cane vinegars from Ilocos are made in two different ways. One way is to simply
place sugar cane juice in large jars; it becomes sour by the direct action of
bacteria on the sugar. The other way is through fermentation to produce a local
wine known as basi. Low-quality basi is then allowed to undergo acetic acid
fermentation that converts alcohol into acetic acid. Contaminated basi also
becomes vinegar.
A white variation has become quite popular in Brazil in recent years, where it
is the cheapest type of vinegar sold. It is now common for other types of
vinegar (made from wine, rice and apple cider) to be sold mixed with cane
vinegar to lower the cost.[citation_needed]
Sugarcane sirka is made from sugarcane juice in Punjab, India. During summer
people put cane juice in earthenware pots with iron nails. The fermentation
takes place due to the action of wild yeast. The cane juice is converted to
vinegar having a blackish color. The sirka is used to preserve pickles and for
flavoring curries.
**** Grains[edit] ****
Chinese black_vinegar
Chinese black_vinegar is an aged product made from rice, wheat, millet,
sorghum, or a combination thereof. It has an inky black color and a complex,
malty flavor. There is no fixed recipe, so some Chinese black vinegars may
contain added_sugar, spices, or caramel color. The most popular variety,
Zhenjiang_vinegar, originates in the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu_Province,
eastern China.[23] Shanxi mature vinegar is another popular type of Chinese
vinegar that is made exclusively from sorghum and other grains. Nowadays in
Shanxi province, there are still some traditional vinegar workshops producing
handmade vinegar which is aged for at least five years with a high acidity.
Only the vinegar made in Taiyuan and some counties in Jinzhong and aged for at
least three years is considered authentic Shanxi mature vinegar according to
the latest national standard. A somewhat lighter form of black vinegar, made
from rice, is produced in Japan, where it is called kurozu.
Rice_vinegar is most popular in the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia. It is
available in "white" (light yellow), red, and black varieties. The Japanese
prefer a light rice vinegar for the preparation of sushi_rice and salad
dressings. Red rice vinegar traditionally is colored with red_yeast_rice. Black
rice vinegar (made with black glutinous rice) is most popular in China, and it
is also widely used in other East Asian countries. White rice vinegar has a
mild acidity with a somewhat "flat" and uncomplex flavor. Some varieties of
rice vinegar are sweetened or otherwise seasoned with spices or other added
flavorings.
Malt vinegar made from ale, also called alegar[24], is made by malting barley,
causing the starch in the grain to turn to maltose. Then an ale is brewed from
the maltose and allowed to turn into vinegar, which is then aged.[24] It is
typically light-brown in color. In the United Kingdom and Canada, malt vinegar
(along with salt) is a traditional seasoning for fish_and_chips. Some fish and
chip shops replace it with non-brewed_condiment.
According to Canadian regulations, malt vinegar is defined as a vinegar that
includes undistilled malt that has not yet undergone acetous fermentation. It
must be dextro-rotary and cannot contain less than 1.8 grams of solids and 0.2
grams of ash per 100 millilitres at 20 degrees Celsius. It may contain
additional cereals or caramel.[25]
**** Spirits[edit] ****
Sherry_vinegar
The term spirit vinegar is sometimes reserved for the stronger variety (5% to
21% acetic acid) made from sugar cane or from chemically produced acetic acid.
[26] To be called "Spirit Vinegar", the product must come from an agricultural
source and must be made by "double fermentation". The first fermentation is
sugar to alcohol and the second alcohol to acetic acid. Product made from
chemically produced acetic acid cannot be called "vinegar" in the UK, where the
term allowed is "Non-brewed_condiment".
Sherry_vinegar is linked to the production of sherry wines of Jerez. Dark
mahogany in color, it is made exclusively from the acetic fermentation of
wines. It is concentrated and has generous aromas, including a note of wood,
ideal for vinaigrettes and flavoring various foods. Wine vinegar is made from
red or white wine, and is the most commonly used vinegar in Southern and
Central_Europe, Cyprus and Israel. As with wine, there is a considerable range
in quality. Better-quality wine vinegars are matured in wood for up to two
years, and exhibit a complex, mellow flavor. Wine vinegar tends to have a lower
acidity than white or cider vinegars. More expensive wine vinegars are made
from individual varieties of wine, such as champagne, sherry, or pinot gris.
The term "distilled vinegar" as used in the United States (called "spirit
vinegar" in the UK, "white vinegar" in Canada[27]) is something of a misnomer
because it is not produced by distillation but by fermentation of distilled
alcohol. The fermentate is diluted to produce a colorless solution of 5% to 8%
acetic acid in water, with a pH of about 2.6. This is variously known as
distilled spirit, "virgin" vinegar,[28] or white vinegar, and is used in
cooking, baking, meat preservation, and pickling, as well as for medicinal,
laboratory, and cleaning purposes.[26] The most common starting material in
some regions, because of its low cost, is barley malt,[29] or in the United
States, corn. It is sometimes derived from petroleum.[30] Distilled vinegar is
used predominantly for cooking, although in the UK it is used as an alternative
to brown or light malt vinegar. White distilled vinegar can also be used for
cleaning, and some is actually sold specifically for this purpose.
***** Culinary uses[edit] *****
Vinegar is commonly used in food_preparation, in particular pickling liquids,
vinaigrettes and other salad_dressings. It is an ingredient in sauces, such as
hot_sauce, mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Vinegar is sometimes used in
chutneys. It is often used as a condiment on its own, or as a part of other
condiments. Marinades often contain vinegar. Soups sometimes have vinegar added
to them, as is the case with hot_and_sour_soup. In terms of its shelf_life,
vinegar's acidic nature allows it to last indefinitely without the use of
refrigeration.[31]
**** Beverages[edit] ****
Several beverages are made using vinegar, for instance Posca in ancient_Rome.
The ancient_Greek drink oxymel is made from vinegar and honey, and sekanjabin
is a traditional Persian_drink similar to oxymel. Other preparations, known
colloquially as "shrubs", range from simply mixing sugar water or honey water
with small amounts of fruity vinegar, to making syrup by laying fruit or mint
in vinegar for several days, then sieving off solid parts and adding
considerable amounts of sugar. Some prefer to boil the "shrub" as a final step.
These recipes have lost much of their popularity with the rise of carbonated
beverages, such as soft drinks.
**** Diet and metabolism[edit] ****
Relatively small amounts of vinegar (2 to 4 tablespoons) may reduce post-meal
levels of blood_glucose and insulin in people with and without diabetes.[32]
[33][34]
**** Nutrition[edit] ****
Distilled or red wine vinegar is 95% water, with no carbohydrates, fat, or
protein.[35] In a 100 mL (gram) reference amount, distilled vinegar supplied 18
calories and no micronutrients in significant content.[35] The composition (and
absence of nutrient content) for red wine vinegar and apple_cider_vinegar (ACV)
are the same, whereas balsamic_vinegar is 77% water with 17% carbohydrates, 88
calories per 100 mL, and contains no fat, protein or micronutrients.[22]
***** In folk medicine[edit] *****
For millennia, folk_medicine treatments have used vinegar, but there is no
evidence from clinical_research to support health_claims of benefits for
diabetes, weight_loss, cancer or use as a probiotic.[32] Some treatments with
vinegar pose risks to health.[36] Esophageal injury by apple_cider_vinegar has
been reported, and because vinegar products sold for medicinal purposes are
neither regulated nor standardized, such products may vary widely in content
and acidity.[37]
***** As a pesticide[edit] *****
Twenty percent acetic acid vinegar can be used as a herbicide,[38] but acetic
acid is not absorbed into root systems so the vinegar will only kill the top
growth and perennial_plants may reshoot.[39]
Applying vinegar to common jellyfish stings deactivates the nematocysts,
although not as effectively as hot water.[40] This does not apply to the
Portuguese_man_o'_war, which, although generally considered to be a jellyfish,
is not; vinegar applied to Portuguese man o' war stings can cause their
nematocysts to discharge venom, making the pain worse.[41]
Vinegar is not effective against lice[42].
***** Household uses[edit] *****
White_vinegar is often used as a household cleaning agent. For most uses,
dilution with water is recommended for safety and to avoid damaging the
surfaces being cleaned. Because it is acidic, it can dissolve mineral_deposits
from glass, coffee_makers, and other smooth surfaces.[43] Vinegar is known as
an effective cleaner of stainless_steel and glass. Malt vinegar sprinkled onto
crumpled newspaper is a traditional, and still-popular, method of cleaning
grease-smeared windows and mirrors in the United Kingdom.[44]
Vinegar can be used for polishing copper, brass, bronze or silver. It is an
excellent solvent for cleaning epoxy_resin as well as the gum on sticker-type
price_tags. It has been reported as an effective drain_cleaner.[45]
***** Miscellaneous[edit] *****
Most commercial vinegar solutions available to consumers for household use do
not exceed 5%. Solutions above 10% require careful handling, as they are
corrosive and damaging to the skin.[46]
When a bottle of vinegar is opened, mother_of_vinegar may develop. It is
considered harmless and can be removed by filtering.[47]
Vinegar_eels (Turbatrix aceti), a form of nematode, may occur in some forms of
vinegar unless the vinegar is kept covered. These feed on the mother of vinegar
and can occur in naturally fermenting vinegar.[48]
Some countries prohibit the selling of vinegar over a certain percentage
acidity. As an example, the government of Canada limits the acetic acid of
vinegars to between 4.1% and 12.3%.[49]
According to legend, in France during the Black_Plague, four thieves were able
to rob houses of plague victims without being infected themselves. When finally
caught, the judge offered to grant the men their freedom, on the condition that
they revealed how they managed to stay healthy. They claimed that a medicine
woman sold them a potion made of garlic soaked in soured red wine (vinegar).
Variants of the recipe, called Four_Thieves_Vinegar, have been passed down for
hundreds of years and are a staple of New_Orleans hoodoo practices.[50][51]
A solution of vinegar can be used for water_slide_decal application as used on
scale models and musical instruments, among other things. One part white
distilled vinegar (5% acidity) diluted with two parts of distilled or filtered
water creates a suitable solution for the application of water-slide decals to
hard surfaces. The solution is very similar to the commercial products, often
described as "decal softener", sold by hobby shops. The slight acidity of the
solution softens the decal and enhances its flexibility, permitting the decal
to cling to contours more efficiently.
When baking_soda and vinegar are combined, the bicarbonate ion of the baking
soda reacts to form carbonic_acid, which decomposes into carbon dioxide and
water.[52]
