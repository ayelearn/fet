Yeasts are eukaryotic single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the
fungus kingdom. The first yeast originated hundreds of millions of years ago,
and 1,500 species are currently identified.[1][2][3] They are estimated to
constitute 1% of all described fungal species.[4] Yeasts are unicellular
organisms that evolved from multicellular ancestors,[5] with some species
having the ability to develop multicellular characteristics by forming strings
of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae or false hyphae.[6] Yeast
sizes vary greatly, depending on species and environment, typically measuring
3â4 Âµm in diameter, although some yeasts can grow to 40 Âµm in size.[7] Most
yeasts reproduce asexually by mitosis, and many do so by the asymmetric
division process known as budding.
Yeasts, with their single-celled growth habit, can be contrasted with molds,
which grow hyphae. Fungal species that can take both forms (depending on
temperature or other conditions) are called dimorphic_fungi ("dimorphic" means
"having two forms").
By fermentation, the yeast species Saccharomyces_cerevisiae converts
carbohydrates to carbon_dioxide and alcohols â for thousands of years the
carbon dioxide has been used in baking and the alcohol in alcoholic beverages.
[8] It is also a centrally important model_organism in modern cell_biology
research, and is one of the most thoroughly researched eukaryotic
microorganisms. Researchers have used it to gather information about the
biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology.[9] Other species
of yeasts, such as Candida_albicans, are opportunistic_pathogens and can cause
infections in humans. Yeasts have recently been used to generate electricity in
microbial_fuel_cells,[10] and produce ethanol for the biofuel industry.
Yeasts do not form a single taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping. The term
"yeast" is often taken as a synonym for Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[11] but the
phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is shown by their placement in two separate
phyla: the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota. The budding yeasts ("true yeasts")
are classified in the order Saccharomycetales,[12] within the phylum
Ascomycota.

***** History *****
See also: History_of_wine and History_of_beer
The word "yeast" comes from Old_English gist, gyst, and from the Indo-European
root yes-, meaning "boil", "foam", or "bubble".[13] Yeast microbes are probably
one of the earliest domesticated organisms. Archaeologists digging in Egyptian
ruins found early grinding stones and baking chambers for yeast-raised bread,
as well as drawings of 4,000-year-old bakeries and breweries.[14] In 1680,
Dutch naturalist Anton_van_Leeuwenhoek first microscopically observed yeast,
but at the time did not consider them to be living_organisms, but rather
globular structures[15] as researchers were doubtful whether yeasts were algae
or fungi.[16] Theodor_Schwann recognized them as fungi in 1837.[17][18]
In 1857, French microbiologist Louis_Pasteur showed that by bubbling oxygen
into the yeast broth, cell_growth could be increased, but fermentation was
inhibited â an observation later called the "Pasteur_effect". In the paper
"MÃ©moire sur la fermentation alcoolique," Pasteur proved that alcoholic
fermentation was conducted by living yeasts and not by a chemical catalyst.[14]
[19]
By the late 18th century two yeast strains used in brewing had been identified:
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (top-fermenting yeast) and S. carlsbergensis (bottom-
fermenting yeast). S. cerevisiae has been sold commercially by the Dutch for
bread-making since 1780; while, around 1800, the Germans started producing
S. cerevisiae in the form of cream. In 1825, a method was developed to remove
the liquid so the yeast could be prepared as solid blocks.[20] The industrial
production of yeast blocks was enhanced by the introduction of the filter_press
in 1867. In 1872, Baron Max de Springer developed a manufacturing process to
create granulated yeast, a technique that was used until the first World War.
[21] In the United States, naturally occurring airborne yeasts were used almost
exclusively until commercial yeast was marketed at the Centennial_Exposition in
1876 in Philadelphia, where Charles_L._Fleischmann exhibited the product and a
process to use it, as well as serving the resultant baked bread.[22]
The mechanical_refrigerator (first patented in the 1850s in Europe) liberated
brewers and winemakers from seasonal constraints for the first time and allowed
them to exit cellars and other earthen environments. For John_Molson, who made
his livelihood in Montreal prior to the development of the fridge, the brewing
season lasted from September through to May. The same seasonal restrictions
formerly governed the distiller's art.[23]
***** Nutrition and growth *****
Yeasts are chemoorganotrophs, as they use organic_compounds as a source of
energy and do not require sunlight to grow. Carbon is obtained mostly from
hexose sugars, such as glucose and fructose, or disaccharides such as sucrose
and maltose. Some species can metabolize pentose sugars such as ribose,[24]
alcohols, and organic_acids. Yeast species either require oxygen for aerobic
cellular_respiration (obligate_aerobes) or are anaerobic, but also have aerobic
methods of energy production (facultative_anaerobes). Unlike bacteria, no known
yeast species grow only anaerobically (obligate_anaerobes). Most yeasts grow
best in a neutral or slightly acidic pH environment.
Yeasts vary in regard to the temperature range in which they grow best. For
example, Leucosporidium_frigidum grows at â2 to 20 Â°C (28 to 68 Â°F),
Saccharomyces_telluris at 5 to 35 Â°C (41 to 95 Â°F), and Candida_slooffi at 28
to 45 Â°C (82 to 113 Â°F).[25] The cells can survive freezing under certain
conditions, with viability decreasing over time.
In general, yeasts are grown in the laboratory on solid growth_media or in
liquid broths. Common media used for the cultivation of yeasts include potato
dextrose_agar or potato_dextrose_broth, Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient agar,
yeast peptone dextrose agar, and yeast mould agar or broth. Home brewers who
cultivate yeast frequently use dried malt_extract and agar as a solid growth
medium. The fungicide cycloheximide is sometimes added to yeast growth media to
inhibit the growth of Saccharomyces yeasts and select for wild/indigenous yeast
species. This will change the yeast process.
The appearance of a white, thready yeast, commonly known as kahm yeast, is
often a byproduct of the lactofermentation (or pickling) of certain vegetables,
usually the result of exposure to air. Although harmless, it can give pickled
vegetables a bad flavor and must be removed regularly during fermentation.[26]
***** Ecology *****
Yeasts are very common in the environment, and are often isolated from sugar-
rich materials. Examples include naturally occurring yeasts on the skins of
fruits and berries (such as grapes, apples, or peaches), and exudates from
plants (such as plant saps or cacti). Some yeasts are found in association with
soil and insects.[27][28] The ecological function and biodiversity of yeasts
are relatively unknown compared to those of other microorganisms.[29] Yeasts,
including Candida_albicans, Rhodotorula rubra, Torulopsis and Trichosporon
cutaneum, have been found living in between people's toes as part of their skin
flora.[30] Yeasts are also present in the gut_flora of mammals and some insects
[31] and even deep-sea environments host an array of yeasts.[32][33]
An Indian study of seven bee species and nine plant species found 45 species
from 16 genera colonise the nectaries of flowers and honey stomachs of bees.
Most were members of the genus Candida; the most common species in honey
stomachs was Dekkera_intermedia and in flower nectaries, Candida_blankii.[34]
Yeast colonising nectaries of the stinking_hellebore have been found to raise
the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators by
increasing the evaporation of volatile_organic_compounds.[29][35] A black_yeast
has been recorded as a partner in a complex relationship between ants, their
mutualistic_fungus, a fungal parasite of the fungus and a bacterium that kills
the parasite. The yeast has a negative effect on the bacteria that normally
produce antibiotics to kill the parasite, so may affect the ants' health by
allowing the parasite to spread.[36]
Certain strains of some species of yeasts produce proteins called yeast killer
toxins that allow them to eliminate competing strains. (See main article on
killer_yeast.) This can cause problems for winemaking but could potentially
also be used to advantage by using killer toxin-producing strains to make the
wine. Yeast killer toxins may also have medical applications in treating yeast
infections (see "Pathogenic yeasts" section below).[37]
Marine yeasts, defined as the yeasts that are isolated from marine
environments, are able to grow better on a medium prepared using seawater
rather than freshwater.[38] The first marine yeasts were isolated by Bernhard
Fischer in 1894 from the Atlantic Ocean, and those were identified as Torula
sp. and Mycoderma sp.[39] Following this discovery, various other marine yeasts
have been isolated from around the world from different sources, including
seawater, seaweeds, marine fish and mammals.[40] Among these isolates, some
marine yeasts originated from terrestrial habitats (grouped as facultative
marine yeast), which were brought to and survived in marine environments. The
other marine yeasts were grouped as obligate or indigenous marine yeasts, which
confine to marine habitats.[39] However, no sufficient evidence has been found
to explain the indispensability of seawater for obligate marine yeasts.[38] It
has been reported that marine yeasts are able to produce many bioactive
substances, such as amino acids, glucans, glutathione, toxins, enzymes, phytase
and vitamins with potential application in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic
and chemical industries as well as for marine culture and environmental
protection.[38] Marine yeast was successfully used to produce bioethanol using
seawater-based media which will potentially reduce the water_footprint of
bioethanol.[41]
***** Reproduction *****
The yeast cell's life cycle:
   1. Budding
   2. Conjugation
   3. Spore
See also: Mating_of_yeast
Yeasts, like all fungi, may have asexual and sexual reproductive cycles. The
most common mode of vegetative growth in yeast is asexual reproduction by
budding,[42] where a small bud (also known as a bleb or daughter cell) is
formed on the parent cell. The nucleus of the parent cell splits into a
daughter nucleus and migrates into the daughter cell. The bud then continues to
grow until it separates from the parent cell, forming a new cell.[43] The
daughter cell produced during the budding process is generally smaller than the
mother cell. Some yeasts, including Schizosaccharomyces_pombe, reproduce by
fission instead of budding,[42] and thereby creating two identically sized
daughter cells.
In general, under high-stress conditions such as nutrient starvation, haploid
cells will die; under the same conditions, however, diploid cells can undergo
sporulation, entering sexual reproduction (meiosis) and producing a variety of
haploid spores, which can go on to mate (conjugate), reforming the diploid.[44]
The haploid fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a facultative sexual
microorganism that can undergo mating when nutrients are limiting.[3][45]
Exposure of S. pombe to hydrogen peroxide, an agent that causes oxidative
stress leading to oxidative DNA damage, strongly induces mating and the
formation of meiotic spores.[46] The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
reproduces by mitosis as diploid cells when nutrients are abundant, but when
starved, this yeast undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores.[47] Haploid cells
may then reproduce asexually by mitosis. Katz Ezov et al.[48] presented
evidence that in natural S. cerevisiae populations clonal reproduction and
selfing (in the form of intratetrad mating) predominate. In nature, mating of
haploid cells to form diploid cells is most often between members of the same
clonal population and out-crossing is uncommon.[49] Analysis of the ancestry of
natural S. cerevisiae strains led to the conclusion that out-crossing occurs
only about once every 50,000 cell divisions.[49] These observations suggest
that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of
diversity) are likely to be insufficient for generally maintaining sex from one
generation to the next.[50] Rather, a short-term benefit, such as
recombinational repair during meiosis,[51][52] may be the key to the
maintenance of sex in S. cerevisiae.
Some pucciniomycete yeasts, in particular species of Sporidiobolus and
Sporobolomyces, produce aerially dispersed, asexual ballistoconidia.[53]
***** Uses *****
The useful physiological properties of yeast have led to their use in the field
of biotechnology. Fermentation of sugars by yeast is the oldest and largest
application of this technology. Many types of yeasts are used for making many
foods: baker's_yeast in bread production, brewer's yeast in beer_fermentation,
and yeast in wine fermentation and for xylitol production.[54] So-called red
rice_yeast is actually a mold, Monascus_purpureus. Yeasts include some of the
most widely used model_organisms for genetics and cell_biology.[55]
**** Alcoholic beverages ****
Alcoholic beverages are defined as beverages that contain ethanol (C2H5OH).
This ethanol is almost always produced by fermentation â the metabolism of
carbohydrates by certain species of yeasts under anaerobic or low-oxygen
conditions. Beverages such as mead, wine, beer, or distilled_spirits all use
yeast at some stage of their production. A distilled beverage is a beverage
containing ethanol that has been purified by distillation. Carbohydrate-
containing plant material is fermented by yeast, producing a dilute solution of
ethanol in the process. Spirits such as whiskey and rum are prepared by
distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol are
collected in the condensate, including water, esters, and other alcohols, which
(in addition to that provided by the oak in which it may be aged) account for
the flavour of the beverage.
*** Beer ***
Main article: Brewing
See also: Barm

yeast between brewing sessions.
Bubbles of carbon_dioxide forming during beer-brewing[9]
Brewing yeasts may be classed as "top-cropping" (or "top-fermenting") and
"bottom-cropping" (or "bottom-fermenting").[56] Top-cropping yeasts are so
called because they form a foam at the top of the wort during fermentation. An
example of a top-cropping yeast is Saccharomyces_cerevisiae, sometimes called
an "ale yeast".[57] Bottom-cropping yeasts are typically used to produce lager-
type beers, though they can also produce ale-type beers. These yeasts ferment
well at low temperatures. An example of bottom-cropping yeast is Saccharomyces
pastorianus, formerly known as S. carlsbergensis.
Decades ago,[vague] taxonomists reclassified S. carlsbergensis (uvarum) as a
member of S. cerevisiae, noting that the only distinct difference between the
two is metabolic. Lager strains of S. cerevisiae secrete an enzyme called
melibiase, allowing them to hydrolyse melibiose, a disaccharide, into more
fermentable monosaccharides. Top- and bottom-cropping and cold- and warm-
fermenting distinctions are largely generalizations used by laypersons to
communicate to the general public.[58]
The most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, S. cerevisiae, is the same species
as the common baking yeast.[59] Brewer's yeast is also very rich in essential
minerals and the B_vitamins (except B12).[60] However, baking and brewing
yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different
characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, to carbonate dough
in the shortest amount of time possible; brewing yeast strains act more slowly
but tend to produce fewer off-flavours and tolerate higher alcohol
concentrations (with some strains, up to 22%).
Dekkera/Brettanomyces is a genus of yeast known for its important role in the
production of 'lambic' and specialty sour_ales, along with the secondary
conditioning of a particular Belgian Trappist_beer.[61] The taxonomy of the
genus Brettanomyces has been debated since its early discovery and has seen
many reclassifications over the years. Early classification was based on a few
species that reproduced asexually (anamorph form) through multipolar budding.
[62] Shortly after, the formation of ascospores was observed and the genus
Dekkera, which reproduces sexually (teleomorph form), was introduced as part of
the taxonomy.[63] The current taxonomy includes five species within the genera
of Dekkera/Brettanomyces. Those are the anamorphs Brettanomyces_bruxellensis,
Brettanomyces_anomalus, Brettanomyces_custersianus, Brettanomyces_naardenensis,
and Brettanomyces_nanus, with teleomorphs existing for the first two species,
Dekkera_bruxellensis and Dekkera_anomala.[64] The distinction between Dekkera
and Brettanomyces is arguable, with Oelofse et al. (2008) citing Loureiro and
Malfeito-Ferreira from 2006 when they affirmed that current molecular DNA
detection techniques have uncovered no variance between the anamorph and
teleomorph states. Over the past decade, Brettanomyces spp. have seen an
increasing use in the craft-brewing sector of the industry, with a handful of
breweries having produced beers that were primarily fermented with pure
cultures of Brettanomyces spp. This has occurred out of experimentation, as
very little information exists regarding pure culture fermentative capabilities
and the aromatic compounds produced by various strains. Dekkera/Brettanomyces
spp. have been the subjects of numerous studies conducted over the past
century, although a majority of the recent research has focused on enhancing
the knowledge of the wine industry. Recent research on eight Brettanomyces
strains available in the brewing industry focused on strain-specific
fermentations and identified the major compounds produced during pure culture
anaerobic fermentation in wort.[65]
*** Wine ***
Main article: Yeast_in_winemaking
Yeast in a bottle during sparkling wine production at Schramsberg_Vineyards,
Napa
Yeast is used in winemaking, where it converts the sugars present (glucose and
fructose) in grape_juice (must) into ethanol. Yeast is normally already present
on grape skins. Fermentation can be done with this endogenous "wild yeast",[66]
but this procedure gives unpredictable results, which depend upon the exact
types of yeast species present. For this reason, a pure yeast culture is
usually added to the must; this yeast quickly dominates the fermentation. The
wild yeasts are repressed, which ensures a reliable and predictable
fermentation.[67]
Most added wine yeasts are strains of S. cerevisiae, though not all strains of
the species are suitable.[67] Different S. cerevisiae yeast strains have
differing physiological and fermentative properties, therefore the actual
strain of yeast selected can have a direct impact on the finished wine.[68]
Significant research has been undertaken into the development of novel wine
yeast strains that produce atypical flavour profiles or increased complexity in
wines.[69][70]
The growth of some yeasts, such as Zygosaccharomyces and Brettanomyces, in wine
can result in wine_faults and subsequent spoilage.[71] Brettanomyces produces
an array of metabolites when growing in wine, some of which are volatile
phenolic compounds. Together, these compounds are often referred to as
"Brettanomyces character", and are often described as "antiseptic" or
"barnyard" type aromas. Brettanomyces is a significant contributor to wine
faults within the wine industry.[72]
Researchers from the University_of_British_Columbia, Canada, have found a new
strain of yeast that has reduced amines. The amines in red_wine and Chardonnay
produce off-flavors and cause headaches and hypertension in some people. About
30% of people are sensitive to biogenic amines, such as histamines.[73]

Main article: Baker's_yeast
Yeast, the most common one being S. cerevisiae, is used in baking as a
leavening_agent, where it converts the food/fermentable sugars present in dough
into the gas carbon_dioxide. This causes the dough to expand or rise as gas
forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked, the yeast dies and the air
pockets "set", giving the baked product a soft and spongy texture. The use of
potatoes, water from potato boiling, eggs, or sugar in a bread dough
accelerates the growth of yeasts. Most yeasts used in baking are of the same
species common in alcoholic fermentation. In addition, Saccharomyces exiguus
(also known as S. minor), a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains, is
occasionally used for baking. In breadmaking, the yeast initially respires
aerobically, producing carbon dioxide and water. When the oxygen is depleted,
fermentation begins, producing ethanol as a waste product; however, this
evaporates during baking.[74]
A block of compressed fresh yeast
It is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread. The first records that
show this use came from Ancient_Egypt.[8] Researchers speculate a mixture of
flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts
that occur in natural contaminants of the flour caused it to ferment before
baking. The resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the normal
flat, hard cake.
Active dried yeast, a granulated form in which yeast is commercially sold
Today, there are several retailers of baker's yeast; one of the earlier
developments in North America is Fleischmann's_Yeast, in 1868. During World War
II, Fleischmann's developed a granulated active dry yeast which did not require
refrigeration, had a longer shelf_life than fresh yeast, and rose twice as
fast. Baker's yeast is also sold as a fresh yeast compressed into a square
"cake". This form perishes quickly, so must be used soon after production. A
weak solution of water and sugar can be used to determine whether yeast is
expired. In the solution, active yeast will foam and bubble as it ferments the
sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some recipes refer to this as proofing
the yeast, as it "proves" (tests) the viability of the yeast before the other
ingredients are added. When a sourdough starter is used, flour and water are
added instead of sugar; this is referred to as proofing the sponge.[citation
needed]
When yeast is used for making bread, it is mixed with flour, salt, and warm
water or milk. The dough is kneaded until it is smooth, and then left to rise,
sometimes until it has doubled in size. The dough is then shaped into loaves.
Some bread doughs are knocked back after one rising and left to rise again
(this is called dough_proofing) and then baked. A longer rising time gives a
better flavour, but the yeast can fail to raise the bread in the final stages
if it is left for too long initially.
**** Bioremediation ****
Some yeasts can find potential application in the field of bioremediation. One
such yeast, Yarrowia_lipolytica, is known to degrade palm_oil mill effluent,
TNT (an explosive material), and other hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, fatty
acids, fats and oils.[75] It can also tolerate high concentrations of salt and
heavy_metals,[76] and is being investigated for its potential as a heavy metal
biosorbent.[77] Saccharomyces cerevisiae has potential to bioremediate toxic
pollutants like arsenic from industrial effluent.[78] Bronze statues are known
to be degraded by certain species of yeast.[79] Different yeasts from Brazilian
gold mines bioaccumulate free and complexed silver ions.[80]
**** Industrial ethanol production ****
See also: Bioethanol
The ability of yeast to convert sugar into ethanol has been harnessed by the
biotechnology industry to produce ethanol_fuel. The process starts by milling a
feedstock, such as sugar_cane, field_corn, or other cereal_grains, and then
adding dilute sulfuric_acid, or fungal alpha amylase enzymes, to break down the
starches into complex sugars. A glucoamylase is then added to break the complex
sugars down into simple sugars. After this, yeasts are added to convert the
simple sugars to ethanol, which is then distilled off to obtain ethanol up to
96% in purity.[81]
Saccharomyces yeasts have been genetically_engineered to ferment xylose, one of
the major fermentable sugars present in cellulosic_biomasses, such as
agriculture residues, paper wastes, and wood chips.[82][83] Such a development
means ethanol can be efficiently produced from more inexpensive feedstocks,
making cellulosic_ethanol fuel a more competitively priced alternative to
gasoline fuels.[84]
**** Nonalcoholic beverages ****
A kombucha culture fermenting in a jar
Yeast and bacteria in kombucha at 400Ã
A number of sweet carbonated_beverages can be produced by the same methods as
beer, except the fermentation is stopped sooner, producing carbon dioxide, but
only trace amounts of alcohol, leaving a significant amount of residual sugar
in the drink.
    * Root_beer, originally made by Native Americans, commercialized in the
      United States by Charles_Elmer_Hires and especially popular during
      Prohibition
    * Kvass, a fermented drink made from rye, popular in Eastern Europe. It has
      a recognizable, but low alcoholic content.[85]
    * Kombucha, a fermented sweetened tea. Yeast in symbiosis with acetic_acid
      bacteria is used in its preparation. Species of yeasts found in the tea
      can vary, and may include: Brettanomyces_bruxellensis, Candida_stellata,
      Schizosaccharomyces_pombe, Torulaspora_delbrueckii and Zygosaccharomyces
      bailii.[86] Also popular in Eastern Europe and some former_Soviet
      republics under the name chajnyj grib (Russian: Ð§Ð°Ð¹Ð½ÑÐ¹ Ð³ÑÐ¸Ð±),
      which means "tea mushroom".
    * Kefir and kumis are made by fermenting milk with yeast and bacteria.[87]
    * Mauby (Spanish: mabÃ­), made by fermenting sugar with the wild yeasts
      naturally present on the bark of the Colubrina_elliptica tree, popular in
      the Caribbean

Yeast is used in nutritional supplements, especially those marketed to vegans.
It is often referred to as "nutritional_yeast" when sold as a dietary
supplement. Nutritional yeast is a deactivated yeast, usually S.  cerevisiae.
It is naturally low in fat and sodium as well as an excellent source of protein
and vitamins, especially most B-complex vitamins[88] (contrary to some claims,
it contains little or no vitamin B12[60] ), as well as other minerals and
cofactors required for growth. Some brands of nutritional yeast, though not
all, are fortified with vitamin_B12, which is produced separately by bacteria.
[89]
In 1920, the Fleischmann_Yeast_Company began to promote yeast cakes in a "Yeast
for Health" campaign. They initially emphasized yeast as a source of vitamins,
good for skin and digestion. Their later advertising claimed a much broader
range of health benefits, and was censured as misleading by the Federal_Trade
Commission. The fad for yeast cakes lasted until the late 1930s.[90]
Nutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy flavor and is often used as an ingredient
in cheese substitutes. Another popular use is as a topping for popcorn. It can
also be used in mashed and fried potatoes, as well as in scrambled_eggs. It
comes in the form of flakes, or as a yellow powder similar in texture to
cornmeal. In Australia, it is sometimes sold as "savoury yeast flakes". Though
"nutritional yeast" usually refers to commercial products, inadequately fed
prisoners have used "home-grown" yeast to prevent vitamin deficiency.[91]
**** Probiotics ****
Some probiotic supplements use the yeast S. boulardii to maintain and restore
the natural flora in the gastrointestinal_tract. S. boulardii has been shown to
reduce the symptoms of acute diarrhea,[92] reduce the chance of infection by
Clostridium_difficile (often identified simply as C. difficile or C. diff),[93]
reduce bowel movements in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients,[94] and reduce the
incidence of antibiotic-, traveler's-, and HIV/AIDS-associated diarrheas.[95]
**** Aquarium hobby ****
Yeast is often used by aquarium hobbyists to generate carbon dioxide (CO2) to
nourish plants in planted_aquaria.[96] CO2 levels from yeast are more difficult
to regulate than those from pressurized CO2 systems. However, the low cost of
yeast makes it a widely used alternative.[96]

Marmite and Vegemite, products made from yeast_extract
Marmite and Vegemite are dark in colour
Yeast extract is the common name for various forms of processed yeast products
that are used as food_additives or flavours. They are often used in the same
way that monosodium_glutamate (MSG) is used and, like MSG, often contain free
glutamic_acid.[97] The general method for making yeast extract for food
products such as Vegemite and Marmite on a commercial scale is to add salt to a
suspension of yeast, making the solution hypertonic, which leads to the cells'
shrivelling up. This triggers autolysis, wherein the yeast's digestive enzymes
break their own proteins down into simpler compounds, a process of self-
destruction. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown,
after which the husks (yeast with thick cell walls that would give poor
texture) are separated. Yeast autolysates are used in Vegemite and Promite
(Australia); Marmite (the United Kingdom); the unrelated Marmite (New Zealand);
Vitam-R (Germany); and Cenovis (Switzerland).
**** Scientific research ****
Diagram showing a yeast cell
Several yeasts, in particular S. cerevisiae and S._pombe, have been widely used
in genetics and cell biology, largely because they are simple eukaryotic cells,
serving as a model for all eukaryotes, including humans, for the study of
fundamental cellular processes such as the cell_cycle, DNA_replication,
recombination, cell_division, and metabolism. Also, yeasts are easily
manipulated and cultured in the laboratory, which has allowed for the
development of powerful standard techniques, such as yeast_two-hybrid,[98]
synthetic_genetic_array analysis,[99] and tetrad_analysis. Many proteins
important in human biology were first discovered by studying their homologues
in yeast; these proteins include cell_cycle_proteins, signaling_proteins, and
protein-processing enzymes.[100]
On 24 April 1996, S. cerevisiae was announced to be the first eukaryote to have
its genome, consisting of 12 million base_pairs, fully sequenced as part of the
Genome_Project.[101] At the time, it was the most complex organism to have its
full genome sequenced, and the work seven years and the involvement of more
than 100 laboratories to accomplish.[102] The second yeast species to have its
genome sequenced was Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which was completed in 2002.
[103][104] It was the sixth eukaryotic genome sequenced and consists of
13.8 million base pairs. As of 2014, over 50 yeast species have had their
genomes sequenced and published.[105]
Genomic and functional gene annotation of the two major yeast models can be
accessed via their respective model_organism_databases: SGD[106][107] and
PomBase.[108][109]
**** Genetically engineered biofactories ****
Various yeast species have been genetically engineered to efficiently produce
various drugs, a technique called metabolic_engineering. S. cerevisiae is easy
to genetically engineer; its physiology, metabolism and genetics are well
known, and it is amenable for use in harsh industrial conditions. A wide
variety of chemical in different classes can be produced by engineered yeast,
including phenolics, isoprenoids, alkaloids, and polyketides.[110] About 20% of
biopharmaceuticals are produced in S. cerevisiae, including insulin, vaccines
for hepatitis, and human_serum_albumin.[111]
***** Pathogenic yeasts *****

morphological characteristics
Some species of yeast are opportunistic_pathogens that can cause infection in
people with compromised immune_systems. Cryptococcus_neoformans and
Cryptococcus_gattii are significant pathogens of immunocompromised people. They
are the species primarily responsible for cryptococcosis, a fungal disease that
occurs in about one million HIV/AIDS patients, causing over 600,000 deaths
annually.[112] The cells of these yeast are surrounded by a rigid
polysaccharide capsule, which helps to prevent them from being recognised and
engulfed by white_blood_cells in the human body.[113]
Yeasts of the genus Candida, another group of opportunistic pathogens, cause
oral and vaginal_infections in humans, known as candidiasis. Candida is
commonly found as a commensal yeast in the mucous_membranes of humans and other
warm-blooded animals. However, sometimes these same strains can become
pathogenic. The yeast cells sprout a hyphal outgrowth, which locally penetrates
the mucosal_membrane, causing irritation and shedding of the tissues.[114] A
book from the 1980s listed the pathogenic yeasts of candidiasis in probable
descending order of virulence for humans as: C. albicans, C. tropicalis,
C. stellatoidea, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii,
C. viswanathii, C. lusitaniae, and Rhodotorula_mucilaginosa.[115] Candida
glabrata is the second most common Candida pathogen after C. albicans, causing
infections of the urogenital_tract, and of the bloodstream (candidemia).[116]
C. auris has been more recently identified.
***** Food spoilage *****
Yeasts are able to grow in foods with a low pH (5.0 or lower) and in the
presence of sugars, organic acids, and other easily metabolized carbon sources.
[117] During their growth, yeasts metabolize some food components and produce
metabolic end products. This causes the physical, chemical, and sensible
properties of a food to change, and the food is spoiled.[118] The growth of
yeast within food products is often seen on their surfaces, as in cheeses or
meats, or by the fermentation of sugars in beverages, such as juices, and
semiliquid products, such as syrups and jams.[117] The yeast of the genus
Zygosaccharomyces have had a long history as spoilage yeasts within the food
industry. This is mainly because these species can grow in the presence of high
sucrose, ethanol, acetic_acid, sorbic_acid, benzoic_acid, and sulphur_dioxide
concentrations,[71] representing some of the commonly used food_preservation
methods. Methylene_blue is used to test for the presence of live yeast cells.
[119] In oenology, the major spoilage yeast is Brettanomyces_bruxellensis.
Candida_blankii has been detected in Iberian_ham and meat.[120]
***** Symbiosis *****
Main article: Symbiosis
An Indian study of seven bee species and 9 plant species found 45 yeast species
from 16 genera colonise the nectaries of flowers and honey stomachs of bees.
Most were members of the genus Candida; the most common species in honey bee
stomachs was Dekkera_intermedia, while the most common species colonising
flower nectaries was Candida_blankii. Although the mechanics are not fully
understood, it was found that A. indica flowers more if C. blankii are present.
