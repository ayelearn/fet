Provision to cells and organisms to support life
Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other
substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and
disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation,
biosynthesis, catabolism, and excretion.[1]
The diet of an organism is what it eats, which is largely determined by the
availability and palatability of foods. For humans, a healthy_diet includes
preparation_of_food and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation,
heat or leaching, and that reduces risk of foodborne_illnesses.
In humans, an unhealthy diet can cause deficiency-related diseases such as
blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm_birth, stillbirth and cretinism,[2] or
nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity[3][4] and
metabolic_syndrome;[5] and such common chronic systemic diseases as
cardiovascular_disease,[6] diabetes,[7][8] and osteoporosis.[9][10][11]
Undernutrition can lead to wasting in acute cases, and the stunting of marasmus
in chronic cases of malnutrition.[2]

***** History of human nutrition[edit] *****
**** Antiquity[edit] ****
[Stone_sculpture_of_a_man's_head]
Hippocrates lived in about 400 BC, and Galen and the understanding of nutrition
followed him for centuries.
The first recorded dietary advice, carved into a Babylonian stone tablet in
about 2500 BC, cautioned those with pain inside to avoid eating onions for
three days. Scurvy, later found to be a vitamin_C_deficiency, was first
described in 1500 BC in the Ebers_Papyrus.[12]
According to Walter_Gratzer, the study of nutrition probably began during the
6th century BC. In China, the concept of qi developed, a spirit or "wind"
similar to what Western Europeans later called pneuma.[13] Food was classified
into "hot" (for example, meats, blood, ginger, and hot spices) and "cold"
(green vegetables) in China, India, Malaya, and Persia.[14] Humours developed
perhaps first in China alongside qi.[13] Ho the Physician concluded that
diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements (Wu_Xing: fire, water, earth,
wood, and metal), and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets.[14]
About the same time in Italy, Alcmaeon_of_Croton (a Greek) wrote of the
importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out, and warned
that imbalance would result in disease marked by obesity or emaciation.[15]
The first recorded nutritional experiment with human subjects is found in the
Bible's Book_of_Daniel. Daniel and his friends were captured by the king of
Babylon during an invasion of Israel. Selected as court servants, they were to
share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring
vegetables (pulses) and water in accordance with their Jewish dietary
restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial. Daniel
and his friends received their diet for ten days and were then compared to the
king's men. Appearing healthier, they were allowed to continue with their diet.
[16][17]
Around 475 BC, Anaxagoras stated that food is absorbed by the human body and,
therefore, contains "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the
existence of nutrients.[18] Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, who recognized and was
concerned with obesity, which may have been common in southern Europe at the
time,[15] said, "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."[19] The
works that are still attributed to him, Corpus_Hippocraticum, called for
moderation and emphasized exercise.[15]
[Shoulder_high_portrait_of_a_man_with_beard_and_mustache_wearing_a_cap]
Followed for a millennium and a half, Galen (1st century) created the first
coherent (although mistaken) theory of nutrition.[20]
Salt, pepper and other spices were prescribed for various ailments in various
preparations for example mixed with vinegar. In the 2nd century BC, Cato_the
Elder believed that cabbage (or the urine of cabbage-eaters) could cure
digestive diseases, ulcers, warts, and intoxication. Living about the turn of
the millennium, Aulus_Celsus, an ancient Roman doctor, believed in "strong" and
"weak" foods (bread for example was strong, as were older animals and
vegetables).[20]
**** Galen to Lind[edit] ****
One mustn't overlook the doctrines of Galen: In use from his life in the 1st
century AD until the 17th century, it was heresy to disagree with him for 1500
years.[21] Galen was physician to gladiators in Pergamon, and in Rome,
physician to Marcus_Aurelius and the three emperors who succeeded him.[22] Most
of Galen's teachings were gathered and enhanced in the late 11th century by
Benedictine_monks at the School_of_Salerno in Regimen_sanitatis_Salernitanum,
which still had users in the 17th century.[23] Galen believed in the bodily
humours of Hippocrates, and he taught that pneuma is the source of life. Four
elements (earth, air, fire and water) combine into "complexion", which combines
into states (the four_temperaments: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and
melancholic). The states are made up of pairs of attributes (hot and moist,
cold and moist, hot and dry, and cold and dry), which are made of four_humours:
blood, phlegm, green (or yellow) bile, and black bile (the bodily form of the
elements). Galen thought that for a person to have gout, kidney_stones, or
arthritis was scandalous, which Gratzer likens to Samuel Butler's Erehwon
(1872) where sickness is a crime.[21]
[Waist_high_portrait_drawn_in_pen_and_ink_of_a_man_balancing_three_books]
James_Lind conducted in 1747 the first controlled clinical_trial in modern
times, and in 1753 published Treatise on Scurvy.[24]
In the 1500s, Paracelsus was probably the first to criticize Galen publicly.
[21] Also in the 16th century, scientist and artist Leonardo_da_Vinci compared
metabolism to a burning candle. Leonardo did not publish his works on this
subject, but he was not afraid of thinking for himself and he definitely
disagreed with Galen.[14] Ultimately, 16th century works of Andreas_Vesalius,
sometimes called the father of modern human_anatomy, overturned Galen's ideas.
[25] He was followed by piercing thought amalgamated with the era's mysticism
and religion sometimes fueled by the mechanics of Newton and Galileo. Jan
Baptist_van_Helmont, who discovered several gases such as carbon_dioxide,
performed the first quantitative_experiment. Robert_Boyle advanced chemistry.
Sanctorius measured body_weight. Physician Herman_Boerhaave modeled the
digestive_process. Physiologist Albrecht_von_Haller worked out the difference
between nerves and muscles.[26]
Sometimes forgotten during his life, James_Lind, a physician in the British
navy, performed the first scientific nutrition experiment in 1747. Lind
discovered that lime juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from
scurvy, a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. Between 1500 and 1800, an
estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy.[27] The discovery was ignored
for forty years, after which British sailors became known as "limeys."[28] The
essential vitamin_C within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists
until 1932.[27]
**** Lavoisier and modern science[edit] ****
[Black_and_white_engraving_of_Lavoisier's_laboratory,_man_seated_at_left_with_a
tube_attached_to_his_mouth,_man_at_center_conducting_experiment,_woman_seated
at_right_drawing,_other_people_visible]
By containing his assistant, Armand_Seguin, inside a rubber suit fitted with a
tube sealed to his mouth with putty, Antoine_Lavoisier first measured basal
metabolic_rate.[29] Drawing by Madame_Lavoisier (seated at right).
Around 1770, Antoine_Lavoisier discovered the details of metabolism,
demonstrating that the oxidation of food is the source of body heat. Called the
most fundamental chemical discovery of the 18th century,[30] Lavoisier
discovered the principle of conservation_of_mass. His ideas made the phlogiston
theory of combustion obsolete.[31]
In 1790, George_Fordyce recognized calcium as necessary for the survival of
fowl. In the early 19th century, the elements carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and
oxygen were recognized as the primary components of food, and methods to
measure their proportions were developed.[32]
In 1816, Fran√É¬ßois_Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates
(sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also
fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.
[33] William_Prout in 1827 was the first person to divide foods into
carbohydrates, fat, and protein.[34] During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste
Dumas and Justus_von_Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals
get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same
and that humans do not create organic compounds).[35] With a reputation as the
leading organic_chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal
physiology,[36] Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and
infant_formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value.
[37] In the 1860s, Claude_Bernard discovered that body fat can be synthesized
from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be
stored as fat or as glycogen.[38]
[Neck_high_portrait_of_middle_aged_man_wearing_a_military_uniform]
Takaki_Kanehiro surmised that beriberi was a nutritional deficiency not an
infectious disease.
In the early 1880s, Kanehiro_Takaki observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets
consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed beriberi (or endemic
neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors
and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and
meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease, (not because of
the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts
per million of thiamine to the diet, later understood as a cure[39]).
In 1896, Eugen_Baumann observed iodine in thyroid glands. In 1897, Christiaan
Eijkman worked with natives of Java, who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman
observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms
of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer
bran intact. His assistant, Gerrit_Grijns correctly identified and described
the anti-beriberi substance in rice. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them
brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later,
nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known
as thiamine.
**** From 1900 to the present[edit] ****
[Shoulder_high_portrait_of_white_haired_man_with_a_mustache_and_beard_wearing_a
suit_and_bow_tie]
Carl_von_Voit has been called the father of modern dietetics.
In the early 20th century, Carl_von_Voit and Max_Rubner independently measured
caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles
of physics in nutrition. In 1906, Edith G. Willcock and Frederick_Hopkins
showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice but it did
not assure their growth.[40] In the middle of twelve years of attempts to
isolate them,[41] Hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that "unsuspected dietetic
factors," other than calories, protein, and minerals, are needed to prevent
deficiency diseases.[42] In 1907, Stephen_M._Babcock and Edwin_B._Hart started
the cow feeding, single-grain_experiment, which took nearly four years to
complete.

Oxford_University closed down its nutrition department after World War II
because the subject seemed to have been completed between 1912 and 1944.[44]
In 1912, Casimir_Funk coined the term vitamin, a vital factor in the diet, from
the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing
scurvy, beriberi, and pellagra, were thought then to be derived from ammonia.
The vitamins were studied in the first half of the 20th century.
In 1913, Elmer_McCollum and Marguerite_Davis discovered the first vitamin, fat-
soluble vitamin_A, then water-soluble vitamin_B (in 1915; now known to be a
complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named vitamin_C as the then-
unknown substance preventing scurvy. Lafayette_Mendel and Thomas_Osborne also
performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919, Sir Edward_Mellanby
incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure
it in dogs with cod liver oil.[45] In 1922, McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in
cod liver oil, but found that it still cured rickets.[45] Also in 1922, H.M.
Evans and L.S. Bishop discover vitamin_E as essential for rat pregnancy,
originally calling it "food factor X" until 1925.
In 1925, Hart discovered that trace amounts of copper are necessary for iron
absorption. In 1927, Adolf_Otto_Reinhold_Windaus synthesized vitamin D, and was
awarded the Nobel_Prize in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928, Albert_Szent-Gy√É¬∂rgyi
isolated ascorbic_acid, and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing
scurvy. In 1935, he synthesized it, and in 1937, he won a Nobel Prize for his
efforts. Szent-Gy√É¬∂rgyi concurrently elucidated much of the citric_acid_cycle.
In the 1930s, William_Cumming_Rose identified essential_amino_acids, necessary
protein components that the body cannot synthesize. In 1935, Underwood and
Marston independently discovered the necessity of cobalt. In 1936, Eugene_Floyd
DuBois showed that work and school performance are related to caloric intake.
In 1938, Erhard_Fernholz discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E and
then he tragically disappeared.[46][47] It was synthesised the same year by
Paul_Karrer.[46]
In 1940, rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom_during_and_after_World_War_II took
place according to nutritional principles drawn up by Elsie_Widdowson and
others. In 1941, the first Recommended_Dietary_Allowances (RDAs) were
established by the National_Research_Council.
In 1992, The U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the Food_Guide_Pyramid.
[48] This replaced the Four_Food_Groups (1956-1992) and was superseded by the
concept of MyPlate (2011√¢¬Ä¬ìpresent).
***** Nutrients[edit] *****
Main article: Nutrient
The list of nutrients that people are known to require is, in the words of
Marion_Nestle, "almost certainly incomplete".[49] As of 2014, nutrients are
thought to be of two types: macronutrients which are needed in relatively large
amounts, and micronutrients which are needed in smaller quantities.[50] A type
of carbohydrate, dietary_fiber, i.e. non-digestible material such as cellulose,
is required,[51] for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, although the
exact reasons remain unclear. Some nutrients can be stored - the fat-soluble
vitamins - while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can
be caused by a lack of required nutrients, or for some vitamins and minerals,
too much of a required nutrient.
**** Macronutrients[edit] ****
The macronutrients are carbohydrates, fiber, fats, protein, and water.[50] The
macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino
acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and
some signaling molecules are built) and energy. Some of the structural material
can be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in
Joules or kilocalories (often called "Calories" and written with a capital C to
distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide
17¬†kJ approximately (4¬†kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37¬†kJ
(9¬†kcal) per gram,[52] though the net energy from either depends on such
factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from
instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide
energy, but are required for other reasons.
Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides (glucose, fructose and
galactose) to complex polysaccharides (starch). Fats are triglycerides, made of
assorted fatty_acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids,
but not all, are essential in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body.
Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and
hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing amino
acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them
internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of
energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production, just as ordinary
glucose, in a process known as gluconeogenesis. By breaking down existing
protein, the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to
intermediates in cellular respiration; the remaining ammonia is discarded
primarily as urea in urine.
*** Carbohydrates[edit] ***
Main article: Carbohydrate
Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or
polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain.
They constitute a large part of foods such as rice, noodles, bread, and other
grain-based products, also potatoes , yams, beans, fruits, fruit juices and
vegetables. Monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides contain one,
two, and three or more sugar units, respectively. Polysaccharides are often
referred to as complex carbohydrates because they are typically long, multiple
branched chains of sugar units.
Traditionally, simple carbohydrates are believed to be absorbed quickly, and
therefore to raise blood-glucose levels more rapidly than complex
carbohydrates. This, however, is not accurate.[53][54][55][56] Some simple
carbohydrates (e.g., fructose) follow different metabolic pathways (e.g.,
fructolysis) that result in only a partial catabolism to glucose, while, in
essence, many complex carbohydrates may be digested at the same rate as simple
carbohydrates.[57] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that added
sugars should represent no more than 10% of total energy intake.[58]
** Fiber[edit] **
Main article: Dietary_fiber
Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate that is incompletely absorbed in humans and in
some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce
four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances
it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and
digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate
polymer which is indigestible as humans do not have the required enzymes to
disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole
grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good
sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet.
Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as
constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and
softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole_wheat_flour, nuts and vegetables,
especially stimulates peristalsis √¢¬Ä¬ì the rhythmic muscular contractions of the
intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found
in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal
tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines.
This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of
sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is
thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk
of type_2_diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a
decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.
*** Fat[edit] ***
Main article: Fat
A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several fatty_acids (containing
long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are
typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol
backbone). Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the
detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the
carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas
unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their
molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of
the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated
(one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore,
depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain,
unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans
fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in
nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an
industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation. There are nine kilocalories
in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as conjugated_linoleic_acid, catalpic
acid, eleostearic acid and punicic_acid, in addition to providing energy,
represent potent immune modulatory molecules.
Saturated fats (typically from animal sources) have been a staple in many world
cultures for millennia. Unsaturated fats (e. g., vegetable oil) are considered
healthier, while trans fats are to be avoided. Saturated and some trans fats
are typically solid at room temperature (such as butter or lard), while
unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as olive_oil or flaxseed_oil).
Trans fats are very rare in nature, and have been shown to be highly
detrimental to human health, but have properties useful in the food_processing
industry, such as rancidity resistance.[59]
*** Essential fatty acids[edit] ***
Main article: Essential_fatty_acids
Most fatty acids are non-essential, meaning the body can produce them as
needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do
so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are essential and must be
included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids√¢¬Ä¬îomega-
3 and omega-6_fatty_acids√¢¬Ä¬îseems also important for health, although
definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega"
long-chain polyunsaturated_fatty_acids are substrates for a class of
eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human
body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic_acid
(EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty
acid alpha-linolenic_acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources,
serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly
inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a
building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1),
whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2
prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from
the omega-6 linoleic_acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly
through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly
determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one
reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for
cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume
large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the
essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to
omega-3 fatty acids.
The conversion rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines the production of
the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released
from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-
inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from
DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by
the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as
insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation). The amount and type of
carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence
processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio
of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific
effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e., cell division).
*** Protein[edit] ***
Proteins are chains of amino acids found in most nutritional foods.
Main articles: Protein_(nutrient) and Protein_quality
Proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body (e.g. muscles,
skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions
throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of amino_acids, which
are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these
components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such
as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins
(protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is
no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the
diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all
animals, some amino acids are essential (an animal cannot produce them
internally) and some are non-essential (the animal can produce them from other
nitrogen-containing compounds). About twenty amino acids are found in the human
body, and about ten of these are essential and, therefore, must be included in
the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially
those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during
early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for
instance). A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an
incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.
It is possible with protein_combinations of two incomplete protein sources
(e.g., rice and beans) to make a complete protein source, and characteristic
combinations are the basis of distinct cultural cooking traditions. However,
complementary sources of protein do not need to be eaten at the same meal to be
used together by the body.[60] Excess amino acids from protein can be converted
into glucose and used for fuel through a process called gluconeogenesis.
*** Water[edit] ***
Main article: Drinking_water
A manual water pump in China
Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including urine and feces,
sweating, and by water_vapour in the exhaled breath. Therefore, it is necessary
to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids.
Early recommendations for the quantity of water required for maintenance of
good health suggested that 6√¢¬Ä¬ì8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to
maintain proper hydration.[61] However the notion that a person should consume
eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific
source.[62] The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and
Nutrition Board of the National_Research_Council read: "An ordinary standard
for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this
quantity is contained in prepared foods."[63] More recent comparisons of well-
known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the
volumes of water we need to consume for good health.[64] Therefore, to help
standardize guidelines, recommendations for water consumption are included in
two recent European_Food_Safety_Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-
based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or
adequate daily intakes (ADI).[65] These specifications were provided by
calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of
individuals with √¢¬Ä¬údesirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water
volumes per energy unit consumed.√¢¬Ä¬ù[65]
For healthful hydration, the current EFSA guidelines recommend total water
intakes of 2.0 L/day for adult females and 2.5 L/day for adult males. These
reference values include water from drinking water, other beverages, and from
food. About 80% of our daily water requirement comes from the beverages we
drink, with the remaining 20% coming from food.[66] Water content varies
depending on the type of food consumed, with fruit and vegetables containing
more than cereals, for example.[67] These values are estimated using country-
specific food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation
of the United Nations.[67]
The EFSA panel also determined intakes for different populations. Recommended
intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for adults as despite lower
energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a
reduction in renal concentrating capacity.[65] Pregnant and breastfeeding women
require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that
pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women,
plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300
mL/day.[65] To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women
require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-
lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration - too little and too much
water, respectively - can have harmful consequences. Drinking too much water is
one of the possible causes of hyponatremia, i.e., low serum sodium.[65][68]
*** Alcohol (ethanol)[edit] ***
Pure ethanol provides 7 calories per gram. For distilled_spirits, a standard
serving in the United States is 1.5 fluid ounces, which at 40% ethanol (80
proof), would be 14 grams and 98 calories.[69] Wine and beer contain a similar
range of ethanol for servings of 5 ounces and 12 ounces, respectively, but
these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5 ounce serving of wine
contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12 ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200
calories.[70] According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on NHANES
2013-2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8 grams/day and
men consume on average 15.5 grams/day.[71] Ignoring the non-alcohol
contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are
48 and 108 cal/day. Alcoholic beverages are considered empty_calorie foods
because other than calories, these contribute no essential nutrients.
**** Micronutrients[edit] ****
The micronutrients are minerals, vitamins, and others.[50]
*** Minerals[edit] ***
Main articles: Mineral_(nutrient) and Composition_of_the_human_body
Dietary minerals are inorganic chemical_elements required by living organisms,
[72] other than the four elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen that
are present in nearly all organic_molecules. The term "mineral" is archaic,
since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet.
Some are heavier than the four just mentioned, including several metals, which
often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be
supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex
compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as calcium
carbonate from ground oyster shells). Some minerals are absorbed much more
readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals
are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is
likely iodine in iodized_salt which prevents goiter.
** Macrominerals[edit] **
Many elements are essential nutrients called dietary_minerals. Some have roles
as cofactors, while others are electrolytes.[73] Elements with recommended
dietary allowance (RDA) greater than 150 ¬†mg/day are, in alphabetical order:
    * Calcium, a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally (for muscle
      and digestive system health, bone strength, some forms neutralize
      acidity, provides signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions)
    * Chloride; electrolyte; see sodium, below
    * Magnesium, required for processing ATP and related reactions (builds
      bone, facilitates peristalsis)
    * Phosphorus, required component of bones; essential for energy processing
      [74]
    * Potassium, an electrolyte (heart and nerve functions)
    * Sodium, an electrolyte; common in food and manufactured beverages,
      typically as sodium_chloride. Excessive sodium consumption can deplete
      calcium and magnesium,[75] leading to high blood pressure.
** Trace minerals[edit] **
Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a
catalytic role in enzymes.[76] Some trace mineral elements (RDA < 200¬†mg/day)
are, in alphabetical order:
    * Cobalt required for biosynthesis of vitamin_B12 family of coenzymes.
      Animals cannot biosynthesize B12, and must obtain this cobalt-containing
      vitamin in their diet.
    * Copper required component of many redox enzymes, including cytochrome_c
      oxidase
      Main article: Copper_in_health
    * Chromium required for sugar metabolism
    * Iodine required not only for the biosynthesis of thyroxine but also¬†√¢¬Ä¬î
      it is presumed¬†√¢¬Ä¬î for other important organs as breast, stomach,
      salivary glands, thymus, etc. (see Extrathyroidal iodine); for this
      reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list,
      and sometimes classified with the macrominerals
    * Iron required for many enzymes, and for hemoglobin and some other
      proteins
    * Manganese (processing of oxygen)
    * Molybdenum required for xanthine_oxidase and related oxidases
    * Selenium required for peroxidase (antioxidant proteins)
    * Zinc required for several enzymes such as carboxypeptidase, liver_alcohol
      dehydrogenase, and carbonic_anhydrase
*** Vitamins[edit] ***
Main article: Vitamin
Vitamins are essential nutrients,[72] necessary in the diet for good health.
(Vitamin_D is an exception, as it can be synthesized in the skin in the
presence of UVB_radiation, and many animal species can synthesize vitamin C.)
Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions, including goitre,
scurvy, osteoporosis, impaired immune system, disorders of cell metabolism,
certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature aging, and poor psychological
health, among many others.[77] Excess levels of some vitamins are also
dangerous to health. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine
has established Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for seven vitamins.[78]
***** Phytochemicals[edit] *****
Main article: Phytochemical
See also: List_of_antioxidants_in_food
Phytochemicals such as polyphenols are compounds produced naturally in plants
(phyto means "plant" in Greek). In general, the term identifies compounds that
are prevalent in plant foods, but are not proven to be essential for human
nutrition, as of 2018. There is no conclusive evidence in humans that
polyphenols or other non-nutrient compounds from plants confer health benefits,
mainly because these compounds have poor bioavailability, i,e., following
ingestion, they are digested into smaller metabolites with unknown functions,
then are rapidly eliminated from the body.[79][80]
While initial studies sought to reveal if dietary_supplements might promote
health, one meta-analysis concluded that supplementation with antioxidant
vitamins A and E and beta-carotene did not convey any benefits, and may
increase risk of death.[81] Vitamin C and selenium supplements did not impact
mortality rate. Health effects of non-nutrient phytochemicals such as
polyphenols were not assessed in this review.[82]
Colorful fruits and vegetables may be components of a healthy diet.
***** Intestinal bacterial flora[edit] *****
Main article: Gut_flora
Animal intestines contain a large population of gut_flora. In humans, the four
dominant phyla are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and
Proteobacteria.[83] They are essential to digestion and are also affected by
food that is consumed. Bacteria in the large intestine perform many important
functions for humans, including breaking down and aiding in the absorption of
fermentable fiber, stimulating cell growth, repressing the growth of harmful
bacteria, training the immune system to respond only to pathogens, producing
vitamin_B12, and defending against some infectious diseases.[84] "Probiotics"
refers to the idea of deliberately consuming live bacteria in an attempt to
change the bacterial population in the large intestine, to the health benefit
of the host human or animal. "Prebiotic_(nutrition)" refers to the idea that
consuming a bacterial energy source such as soluble fiber could support the
population of health-beneficial bacteria in the large intestine. There is not
yet a scientific consensus as to health benefits accruing from probiotics or
prebiotics.
***** Animal nutrition[edit] *****
Main articles: Animal_nutrition and Human_nutrition
Carnivore and herbivore diets are contrasting, with basic nitrogen and carbon
proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial
fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose,
while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or
nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize.[85]
***** Plant nutrition[edit] *****
Main article: Plant_nutrition
Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical_elements that are necessary for
plant growth.[86] There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition.
Some elements are directly involved in plant metabolism. However, this
principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose
presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.
A nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to Liebig's_law_of_the
minimum is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete
its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients,
besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained
by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and hydrogen, which is
obtained from water.
Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the
air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green
plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by
the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air,
while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil
is achieved by cation_exchange, wherein root_hairs pump hydrogen_ions (H+) into
the soil through proton_pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to
negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake
by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel
oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in
photosynthesis.
Although nitrogen is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can
use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be
present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that
largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a nitrogen_fixation process to
biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.[87]
Plant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially
because of the variation between different plants and even between different
species or individuals of a given clone. Elements present at low levels may
cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too
high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of
toxicity from another element, and vice versa.
***** Advice and guidance[edit] *****
**** Government policies[edit] ****
Canada's_Food_Guide is an example of a government-run nutrition program.
Produced by Health_Canada, the guide advises food quantities, provides
education on balanced nutrition, and promotes physical activity in accordance
with government-mandated nutrient needs. Like other nutrition programs around
the world, Canada's Food Guide divides nutrition into four main food groups:
vegetables and fruit, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and
alternatives.[88] Unlike its American counterpart, the Canadian guide
references and provides alternative to meat and dairy, which can be attributed
to the growing vegan and vegetarian movements.
In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by
the US_Department_of_Agriculture and US_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services
and these recommendations are published as the Dietary_Guidelines_for
Americans. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented
in the concept of MyPlate, which superseded the food_pyramid, which replaced
the Four_Food_Groups. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight
of the USDA is the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. Committee
hearings are often televised on C-SPAN. The U.S._Department_of_Health_and_Human
Services provides a sample week-long menu that fulfills the nutritional
recommendations of the government.[89]
**** Government programs[edit] ****
Governmental organisations have been working on nutrition literacy
interventions in non-primary health care settings to address the nutrition
information problem in the U.S. Some programs include:
The Family Nutrition Program (FNP) is a free nutrition education program
serving low-income adults around the U.S. This program is funded by the Food
Nutrition Service√¢¬Ä¬ôs (FNS) branch of the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) usually through a local state academic institution that runs
the program. The FNP has developed a series of tools to help families
participating in the Food Stamp Program stretch their food dollar and form
healthful eating habits including nutrition education.[90]
Expanded_Food_and_Nutrition_Education_Program (ENFEP) is a unique program that
currently operates in all 50 states and in American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia,
Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It is designed to
assist limited-resource audiences in acquiring the knowledge, skills,
attitudes, and changed behavior necessary for nutritionally sound diets, and to
contribute to their personal development and the improvement of the total
family diet and nutritional well-being.
An example of a state initiative to promote nutrition literacy is Smart_Bodies,
a public-private partnership between the state√¢¬Ä¬ôs largest university system
and largest health insurer, Louisiana State Agricultural Center and Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Louisiana Foundation. Launched in 2005, this program
promotes lifelong healthful eating patterns and physically active lifestyles
for children and their families. It is an interactive educational program
designed to help prevent childhood obesity through classroom activities that
teach children healthful eating habits and physical exercise.
**** Education[edit] ****
Nutrition is taught in schools in many countries. In England_and_Wales, the
Personal_and_Social_Education and Food Technology curricula include nutrition,
stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition
labels on packaging. In many schools, a Nutrition class will fall within the
Family and Consumer Science or Health departments. In some American schools,
students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related
classes. Nutrition is offered at many schools, and, if it is not a class of its
own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills,
Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc. In many
Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid,
Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition,
physical activity, healthful food choices, portion sizes, and how to live a
healthy life.
A 1985, US National_Research_Council report entitled Nutrition Education in US
Medical Schools concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was
inadequate.[91] Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a
separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to
30%.[92] Membership by physicians in leading professional nutrition societies
such as the American_Society_for_Nutrition has generally declined from the
1990s.[93]
**** Professional organizations[edit] ****
In the US, Registered_dietitian_nutritionists (RDs or RDNs)[94] are health
professionals qualified to provide safe, evidence-based dietary advice which
includes a review of what is eaten, a thorough review of nutritional health,
and a personalized nutritional treatment plan through dieting. They also
provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places, schools and similar
institutions. Certified Clinical Nutritionists or CCNs, are trained health
professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic
disease, including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional
deficiencies before resorting to drugs.[95] Government regulation especially in
terms of licensing, is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or
RDN. Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition
Specialist or CNS. These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in
obesity and chronic_disease. In order to become board certified, potential CNS
candidate must pass an examination, much like Registered Dieticians. This exam
covers specific domains within the health sphere including; Clinical
Intervention and Human Health.[96]
***** Nutrition literacy[edit] *****
The findings of the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) provide a
basis upon which to frame the nutrition literacy problem in the U.S. NAAL
introduced the first ever measure of "the degree to which individuals have the
capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and
services needed to make appropriate health decisions"¬†√¢¬Ä¬ì an objective of
Healthy People 2010[97] and of which nutrition literacy might be considered an
important subset. On a scale of below basic, basic, intermediate and
proficient, NAAL found 13 percent of adult Americans have proficient health
literacy, 44% have intermediate literacy, 29 percent have basic literacy and 14
percent have below basic health literacy. The study found that health literacy
increases with education and people living below the level of poverty have
lower health literacy than those above it.
Another study examining the health and nutrition literacy status of residents
of the lower Mississippi Delta found that 52 percent of participants had a high
likelihood of limited literacy skills.[98] While a precise comparison between
the NAAL and Delta studies is difficult, primarily because of methodological
differences, Zoellner et al. suggest that health literacy rates in the
Mississippi Delta region are different from the U.S. general population and
that they help establish the scope of the problem of health literacy among
adults in the Delta region. For example, only 12 percent of study participants
identified the My Pyramid graphic two years after it had been launched by the
USDA. The study also found significant relationships between nutrition literacy
and income level and nutrition literacy and educational attainment[98] further
delineating priorities for the region.
These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of health/
nutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the
social structure and interconnected with other problems. Among these problems
are the lack of information about food choices, a lack of understanding of
nutritional information and its application to individual circumstances,
limited or difficult access to healthful foods, and a range of cultural
influences and socioeconomic constraints such as low levels of education and
high levels of poverty that decrease opportunities for healthful eating and
living.
The links between low health literacy and poor health outcomes has been widely
documented[99] and there is evidence that some interventions to improve health
literacy have produced successful results in the primary care setting. More
must be done to further our understanding of nutrition literacy specific
interventions in non-primary care settings[98] in order to achieve better
health outcomes.
***** Malnutrition[edit] *****
Main article: Malnutrition
According to WHO, malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances
in a person√¢¬Ä¬ôs intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition
addresses 3 broad groups of conditions: undernutrition, which includes wasting
(low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age) and underweight (low
weight-for-age); micronutrient-related malnutrition, which includes
micronutrient deficiencies or insuficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and
minerals) or micronutrient excess; and overweight, obesity and diet-related
noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some
cancers).[100] In Mali, the International_Crops_Research_Institute_for_the
Semi-Arid_Tropics (ICRISAT) and the Aga_Khan_Foundation trained women's groups
to make equinut, a healthy and nutritional version of the traditional recipe
di-d√É¬®gu√É¬® (comprising peanut paste, honey and millet or rice flour). The aim
was to boost nutrition and livelihoods by producing a product that women could
make and sell, and which would be accepted by the local community because of
its local heritage.[101]
**** Insufficient[edit] ****
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs)
and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals. EARs and
RDAs are part of Dietary_Reference_Intakes.[102] The DRI documents describe
nutrient deficiency signs and symptoms.
**** Excessive[edit] ****
The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as
ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. ULs are set a safe
fraction below amounts shown to cause health problems. ULs are part of Dietary
Reference_Intakes.[102] The European_Food_Safety_Authority also reviews the
same safety questions and set its own ULs.[103]
**** Unbalanced[edit] ****
When too much of one or more nutrients is present in the diet to the exclusion
of the proper amount of other nutrients, the diet is said to be unbalanced.
High calorie food ingredients such as vegetable oils, sugar and alcohol are
referred to as "empty_calories" because they displace from the diet foods that
also contain protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber.[104]

bipolar_disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive_compulsive_disorder, the four
most common mental disorders in developed countries.[106] Supplements under
study for possible effects on mood elevation and stabilization include
eicosapentaenoic_acid and docosahexaenoic_acid, which are omega-3_fatty_acids
in fish_oil.[107]

Since the Industrial_Revolution some two hundred years ago, the food processing
industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer
and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the
primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies
have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled.
These latter technologies include pasteurisation, autoclavation, drying,
salting, and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter
the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation
(heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods,
preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food
processing technologies have downfalls as well.
Modern separation techniques such as milling, centrifugation, and pressing have
enabled concentration of particular components of food, yielding flour, oils,
juices, and so on, and even separate fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and
minerals. Inevitably, such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional
content of food, saving certain nutrients while removing others. Heating
techniques may also reduce food's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as
certain vitamins and phytochemicals, and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered
substances.[108] Because of reduced nutritional value, processed foods are
often 'enriched' or 'fortified' with some of the most critical nutrients
(usually certain vitamins) that were lost during processing. Nonetheless,
processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole,
fresh foods, regarding content of both sugar and high GI starches, potassium/
sodium, vitamins, fiber, and of intact, unoxidized (essential) fatty acids. In
addition, processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as
oxidized fats and trans fatty acids.
A dramatic example of the effect of food processing on a population's health is
the history of epidemics of beri-beri in people subsisting on polished rice.
Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential
vitamin thiamine, causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of
scurvy among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned
out that the vast majority of sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-
treated (as suggested by Pasteur) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation
was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.
As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly
prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly
widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has
contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part
of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g.,
nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-
driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective
production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general,
whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable
to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left
with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole,
fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods.
Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing,
storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally
inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many
nutrition-related health complications.
