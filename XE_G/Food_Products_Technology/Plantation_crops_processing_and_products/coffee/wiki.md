[A_cup_of_coffee]
A cup of black coffee
Type              Hot or cold (usually hot)
Country of origin Yemen (drink), Ethiopia (plant)[1]
Introduced        15th century
Color             Black, dark brown, light brown, beige
Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee_beans, the seeds of
berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical
Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar,
the Comoros, Mauritius, and RÃ©union in the Indian_Ocean.[2] Coffee plants are
now cultivated in over_70_countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the
Americas, Southeast_Asia, Indian_subcontinent, and Africa. The two most
commonly grown are C._arabica and C._robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are
picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are
roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are
ground_and_then_brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as
coffee.
Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect
in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most
popular drinks in the world,[4] and it can be prepared and presented in a
variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French_press, caffÃ¨_latte). It is usually
served hot, although iced_coffee is a popular alternative. Clinical studies
indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in
healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption
lowers the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are of
generally poor quality.[5]
While coffee is native to Ethiopia and Sudan, the earliest credible evidence of
coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern
Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines.[6] It was in what is
now Yemen that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar
to how it is now prepared for drinking. But the coffee seeds had to be first
exported from East Africa to Yemen, as Coffea arabica is thought to have been
indigenous to the former.[7] The Yemenis obtained their coffee via Somali
traders from Berbera (who in turn procured the beans from the Ethiopian
Highlands) and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th_century, the drink had
reached Persia, Turkey, and North_Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and
the rest of the world.
As of 2016[update], Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing
one-third_of_the_world_total. Coffee is a major export commodity, being the top
legal agricultural export_for_numerous_countries.[4][8][failed_verification] It
is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing_countries.
Green, unroasted coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in
the world.[9] The way developed_countries trade coffee with developing nations
has been criticised, as well as the impact_on_the_environment with regards to
the clearing_of_land for coffee-growing and water use. Consequently, the
markets for fair_trade and organic_coffee are expanding.[10]

***** Etymology *****
Unroasted coffee beans.
The word coffee appears to have derived from the name of the region where
coffee beans were first used by a herder in the 6th or 9th_century (depending
on author): kaffa (from the Keffa_Zone in southwestern Ethiopia) derived from
Kaffa_Province, which was the name of the region in ancient Abyssinia.[11][12]
The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie,
borrowed from the Ottoman_Turkish kahve, borrowed in turn from the Arabic
qahwah.[13] The Arabic word qahwah was traditionally held to refer to a type of
wine whose etymology is given by Arab lexicographers as deriving from the verb
qahiya, "to lack hunger", in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite
suppressant. It has also been proposed that the source may be the Proto-Central
Semitic root q-h-h meaning "dark".[14]
The term "coffee_pot" dates from 1705.[15] The expression "coffee_break" was
first attested in 1952.[15]
***** History *****
Main article: History_of_coffee
**** Legendary accounts ****
According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo_people in a region of Kaffa
in Ethiopia were the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee
plant.[6] However, no direct evidence that has been found earlier than the 15th
century indicating who among the African populations used it as a stimulant, or
where coffee was first cultivated.[6] The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century
Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited his goats
became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing
until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.[6]
Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. According
to an old chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), Omar, who was
known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from
Mocha in Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab (modern-day Wusab, about 90
kilometres (56 mi) east of Zabid).[16] Starving, Omar chewed berries from
nearby shrubbery but found them to be too bitter. He tried roasting the seeds
to improve the flavor, but they became hard. He then tried boiling them to
soften the seed, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the
liquid Omar was revitalized and sustained for days. As stories of this "miracle
drug" reached Mocha, Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.[17]
**** Historical transmission ****
View of Mocha, Yemen during the second half of the 17th century.
The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee
tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-
Ghaffar in Yemen.[6] It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted
and brewed, in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi
circles to stay awake for their religious rituals.[18] Accounts differ on the
origin of the coffee plant prior to its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia,
coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea.[19]
One account credits Muhammad Ibn_Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden from
the African coast.[20] Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili
Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia.[21] According to al
Shardi, Ali ben Omar may have encountered coffee during his stay with the Adal
king Sadadin's companions in 1401. Famous 16th-century Islamic scholar Ibn
Hajar_al-Haytami notes in his writings of a beverage called qahwa developed
from a tree in the Zeila region.[18] Coffee was first exported out of Ethiopia
to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera. In addition, Mocha, which was the
centre of the coffee trade for much of the early modern era, obtained most of
their coffee from Somali merchants based in Berbera.[22][23]

Over the door of a Leipzig coffeeshop is a sculptural representation of a man
in Turkish_dress, receiving a cup of coffee from a boy.
By the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia,
Turkey, and northern_Africa. The first coffee seeds were smuggled out of the
Middle East was by Sufi Baba_Budan from Yemen to the Indian_subcontinent in
1670. Before then, all exported coffee was boiled or otherwise sterilised.
Portraits of Baba Budan depict him as having smuggled seven coffee seeds by
strapping them to his chest. The first plants grown from these smuggled seeds
were planted in Mysore.
Coffee had spread to Italy by 1600, and then to the rest of Europe, Indonesia,
and the Americas.[24][better source needed]

In 1583, Leonhard_Rauwolf, a German physician, gave this description of coffee
after returning from a ten-year trip to the Near_East:
     A beverage as black as ink, useful against numerous illnesses,
     particularly those of the stomach. Its consumers take it in the
     morning, quite frankly, in a porcelain cup that is passed around and
     from which each one drinks a cupful. It is composed of water and the
     fruit from a bush called bunnu.
     â LÃ©onard Rauwolf, Reise in die MorgenlÃ¤nder (in German)
From the Middle_East, coffee spread to Italy. The thriving trade between Venice
and North Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East (back then Ottoman_Empire),
brought many goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was
introduced to the rest of Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after it
was deemed a Christian beverage by Pope_Clement_VIII in 1600, despite appeals
to ban the "Muslim drink." The first European coffee_house opened in Rome in
1645.[24]

invented by inventor George_Washington in 1909.
The Dutch_East_India_Company was the first to import coffee on a large scale.
[25] The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon.[26] The first exports of
Indonesian_coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in 1711.[27]
Through the efforts of the British_East_India_Company, coffee became popular in
England as well. John_Evelyn recorded tasting the drink at Oxford in England in
a diary entry of May 1637 to where it had been brought by an Ottoman student of
Balliol_College from Crete named Nathaniel Conopios of Crete.[28][29] Oxford's
Queen's_Lane_Coffee_House, established in 1654, is still in existence today.
Coffee was introduced in France in 1657, and in Austria and Poland after the
1683 Battle_of_Vienna, when coffee was captured from supplies of the defeated
Turks.[30]
When coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially
not as successful as it had been in Europe as alcoholic beverages remained more
popular. During the Revolutionary_War, the demand for coffee increased so much
that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically;
this was also due to the reduced availability of tea from British merchants,
[31] and a general resolution among many Americans to avoid drinking tea
following the 1773 Boston_Tea_Party.[32] After the War_of_1812, during which
Britain temporarily cut off access to tea imports, the Americans' taste for
coffee grew.
During the 18th century, coffee consumption declined in England, giving way to
tea-drinking. The latter beverage was simpler to make, and had become cheaper
with the British conquest of India and the tea industry there.[33] During the
Age_of_Sail, seamen aboard ships of the British Royal_Navy made substitute
coffee by dissolving burnt bread in hot water.[34]
The Frenchman Gabriel_de_Clieu took a coffee plant to the French territory of
Martinique in the Caribbean[when?], from which much of the world's cultivated
arabica coffee is descended. Coffee thrived in the climate and was conveyed
across the Americas.[35] Coffee was cultivated in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti)
from 1734, and by 1788 it supplied half the world's coffee.[36] The conditions
that the slaves worked in on coffee plantations were a factor in the soon to
follow Haitian_Revolution. The coffee industry never fully recovered there.[37]
It made a brief come-back in 1949 when Haiti was the world's 3rd largest coffee
exporter, but fell quickly into rapid decline.
Meanwhile, coffee had been introduced_to_Brazil in 1727, although its
cultivation did not gather momentum until independence in 1822.[38] After this
time massive tracts of rainforest were cleared for coffee plantations, first in
the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro and later SÃ£o Paulo.[39] Brazil went from
having essentially no coffee exports in 1800, to being a significant regional
producer in 1830, to being the largest producer in the world by 1852. In
1910â20, Brazil exported around 70% of the world's coffee, Colombia,
Guatemala, and Venezuela, exported half of the remaining 30%, and Old World
production accounted for less than 5% of world exports.[40]
Cultivation was taken up by many countries in Central America in the latter
half of the 19th century, and almost all involved the large-scale displacement
and exploitation of the indigenous people. Harsh conditions led to many
uprisings, coups and bloody suppression of peasants.[41] The notable exception
was Costa_Rica, where lack of ready labor prevented the formation of large
farms. Smaller farms and more egalitarian conditions ameliorated unrest over
the 19th and 20th centuries.[42]
Rapid growth in coffee production in South America during the second half of
the 19th century was matched by growth in consumption in developed countries,
though nowhere has this growth been as pronounced as in the United States,
where a high rate of population growth was compounded by doubling of per capita
consumption between 1860 and 1920. Though the United States was not the
heaviest coffee-drinking nation at the time (Nordic_countries, Belgium, and
Netherlands all had comparable or higher levels of per capita consumption), due
to its sheer size, it was already the largest consumer of coffee in the world
by 1860, and, by 1920, around half of all coffee produced worldwide was
consumed in the US.[40]
Coffee has become a vital cash_crop for many developing_countries. Over one
hundred million people in developing_countries have become dependent on coffee
as their primary source of income. It has become the primary export and
backbone for African countries like Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and Ethiopia,[43]
as well as many Central American countries.

Illustration of Coffea_arabica plant and seeds.
Robusta coffee flowers.
Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from which
coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially cultivated are Coffea
canephora (predominantly a form known as 'robusta') and C. arabica.[44] C.
arabica, the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern
highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma_Plateau in southeastern Sudan and Mount
Marsabit in northern Kenya.[45] C. canephora is native to western and central
Subsaharan Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan.[46] Less popular
species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C. racemosa.
All coffee plants are classified in the large family Rubiaceae. They are
evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m (15 ft) tall when unpruned. The
leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10â15 cm (4â6 in) long and 6 cm
(2.4 in) wide, simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse
at the base to form interpetiolar stipules, characteristic of Rubiaceae. The
flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom
simultaneously. Gynoecium consists of an inferior ovary, also characteristic of
Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of about 1.5 cm (0.6 in).
[47] When immature they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson,
before turning black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but
5â10% of the berries[48] have only one; these are called peaberries.[49]
Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta takes nine to
eleven months.[50]
Coffea arabica is predominantly self-pollinating, and as a result, the
seedlings are generally uniform and varry little from their parents. In
contrast, Coffea canephora, and C. liberica are self-incompatible and require
outcrossing. This means that useful forms and hybrids must be propagated
vegetatively.[51] Cuttings, grafting, and budding are the usual methods of
vegetative propagation.[52] On the other hand, there is great scope for
experimentation in search of potential new strains.[51]
In 2016, Oregon_State_University entomologist George_Poinar,_Jr. announced the
discovery of a new plant species that's a 45-million-year-old relative of
coffee found in amber. Named Strychnos electri, after the Greek word for amber
(electron), the flowers represent the first-ever fossils of an asterid, which
is a clade of flowering plants that not only later gave us coffee, but also
sunflowers, peppers, potatoes, mint â and deadly poisons.[53]
***** Cultivation *****

a:Coffea arabica
The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole at
the beginning of the rainy_season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds'
potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective process of growing
coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then
planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food
crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation
as farmers become familiar with its requirements.[47] Coffee_plants grow within
a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean
belt or coffee belt.[54]
Of the two main species grown, arabica_coffee (from C. arabica) is generally
more highly regarded than robusta_coffee (from C. canephora). Robusta coffee
tends to be bitter and have less flavor but better body than arabica. For these
reasons, about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C. arabica.[44]
Robusta strains also contain about 40â50% more caffeine than arabica.[55]
Consequently, this species is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in
many commercial coffee blends. Good quality robusta beans are used in
traditional Italian espresso blends to provide a full-bodied taste and a better
foam head (known as crema).
Additionally, Coffea canephora is less susceptible to disease than C. arabica
and can be cultivated in lower altitudes and warmer climates where C. arabica
will not thrive.[56] The robusta strain was first collected in 1890 from the
Lomani_River, a tributary of the Congo_River, and was conveyed from the Congo
Free State (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to Brussels to Java
around 1900. From Java, further breeding resulted in the establishment of
robusta plantations in many countries.[57] In particular, the spread of the
devastating coffee leaf rust (Hemileia_vastatrix), to which C. arabica is
vulnerable, hastened the uptake of the resistant robusta. Hemileia vastatrix is
a fungal pathogen[58] and results in light, rust-colored spots on the
undersides of coffee plant leaves. Hemileia vastatrix grows exclusively on the
leaves of coffee pants.[59] Coffee leaf rust is found in virtually all
countries that produce coffee.[60]
Arabica coffee berries on the bush
Mycena_citricolor is another threat to coffee plants, primarily in Latin
America. Mycena citricolor, commonly referred to as American Leaf Spot, is a
fungus that can affect the whole coffee plant.[61] It can grow on leaves,
resulting in leaves with holes that often fall from the plant.[61]
Over 900 species of insect have been recorded as pests of coffee crops
worldwide. Of these, over a third are beetles, and over a quarter are bugs.
Some 20_species_of_nematodes, 9 species of mites, and several snails and slugs
also attack the crop. Birds and rodents sometimes eat coffee berries, but their
impact is minor compared to invertebrates.[62] In general, arabica is the more
sensitive species to invertebrate predation overall. Each part of the coffee
plant is assailed by different animals. Nematodes attack the roots, coffee
borer_beetles burrow into stems and woody material,[63] and the foliage is
attacked by over 100 species of larvae (caterpillars) of butterflies_and_moths.
[64]
Mass spraying of insecticides has often proven disastrous, as predators of the
pests are more sensitive than the pests themselves.[65] Instead, integrated
pest management has developed, using techniques such as targeted treatment of
pest outbreaks, and managing crop environment away from conditions favouring
pests. Branches infested with scale are often cut and left on the ground, which
promotes scale parasites to not only attack the scale on the fallen branches
but in the plant as well.[66]
The 2-mm-long coffee_borer_beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) is the most damaging
insect pest to the world's coffee industry, destroying up to 50 percent or more
of the coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The
adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a coffee berry and lays 35 to
50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the
commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are
mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry
nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When
groves of trees are nearby, the American_yellow_warbler, rufous-capped_warbler,
and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the
number of coffee berry borers in Costa Rica coffee plantations.[67]
Beans from different countries or regions can usually be distinguished by
differences in flavor, aroma, body, and acidity.[68] These taste
characteristics are dependent not only on the coffee's growing region, but also
on genetic subspecies (varietals) and processing.[69] Varietals are generally
known by the region in which they are grown, such as Colombian, Java and Kona.
Arabica coffee beans are cultivated mainly in Latin_America, eastern_Africa or
Asia, while robusta beans are grown in central_Africa, throughout southeast
Asia, and Brazil.[44]
**** Ecological effects ****
[A_cluster_of_bushes_with_drooping_leaves_and_long_chains_of_flowers_sits_in_a
clearing,_surrounded_by_forest.]
A flowering Coffea arabica tree in a Brazilian_plantation.
Originally, coffee farming was done in the shade of trees that provided a
habitat for many animals and insects.[70] Remnant forest trees were used for
this purpose, but many species have been planted as well. These include
leguminous trees of the genera Acacia, Albizia, Cassia, Erythrina, Gliricidia,
Inga, and Leucaena, as well as the nitrogen-fixing non-legume sheoaks of the
genus Casuarina, and the silky oak Grevillea_robusta.[71]
This method is commonly referred to as the traditional shaded method, or
"shade-grown". Starting in the 1970s, many farmers switched their production
method to sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows under full sun with
little or no forest canopy. This causes berries to ripen more rapidly and
bushes to produce higher yields, but requires the clearing of trees and
increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, which damage the environment and
cause health problems.[72]
Unshaded coffee plants grown with fertilizer yield the most coffee, although
unfertilized shaded crops generally yield more than unfertilized unshaded
crops: the response to fertilizer is much greater in full sun.[73] While
traditional coffee production causes berries to ripen more slowly and produce
lower yields, the quality of the coffee is allegedly superior.[74] In addition,
the traditional shaded method provides living space for many wildlife species.
Proponents of shade cultivation say environmental problems such as
deforestation, pesticide_pollution, habitat_destruction, and soil and water
degradation are the side effects of the practices employed in sun cultivation.
[70][75]
The American_Birding_Association, Smithsonian_Migratory_Bird_Center,[76]
National_Arbor_Day_Foundation,[77] and the Rainforest_Alliance have led a
campaign for 'shade-grown' and organic_coffees, which can be sustainably
harvested.[citation_needed] Shaded coffee cultivation systems show greater
biodiversity than full-sun systems, and those more distant from continuous
forest compare rather poorly to undisturbed native forest in terms of habitat
value for some bird species.[78][79]
Another issue concerning coffee is its use_of_water. It takes about 140 liters
(37 U.S. gal) of water to grow the coffee beans needed to produce one cup of
coffee, and coffee is often grown in countries where there is a water shortage,
such as Ethiopia.[80]
Used_coffee_grounds may be used for composting or as a mulch. They are
especially appreciated by worms and acid-loving_plants such as blueberries.[81]
Some commercial coffee shops run initiatives to make better use of these
grounds, including Starbucks' "Grounds for your Garden" project,[82] and
community sponsored initiatives such as "Ground to Ground".[83]
Climate_change may significantly impact coffee yields within a few decades.[84]
Kew_Royal_Botanic_Gardens concluded that global_warming threatens the genetic
diversity of Arabica plants found in Ethiopia and surrounding countries.[85]

Brazil with 33% of the total (table).[86] Vietnam, Colombia, and Indonesia were
other major producers.
***** Processing *****
See also: Coffee_production
Traditional coffee beans drying in Kalibaru, Indonesia.
Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several processes before they become the
familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by
hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries
at the peak of ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all
berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or
machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methodsâthe
dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be
strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into
the process and yields a mild coffee.[87]
Then they are sorted by ripeness and color, and most often the flesh of the
berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds are fermented to remove the
slimy layer of mucilage still present on the seed. When the fermentation is
finished, the seeds are washed with large quantities of fresh_water to remove
the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of coffee_wastewater.
Finally, the seeds are dried.[88]
The best (but least used) method of drying coffee is using drying tables. In
this method, the pulped and fermented coffee is spread thinly on raised beds,
which allows the air to pass on all sides of the coffee, and then the coffee is
mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes place is more uniform, and
fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and
certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional
method.[88]
Next, the coffee is sorted, and labeled as green coffee. Some companies use
cylinders to pump in heated air to dry the coffee seeds, though this is
generally in places where the humidity is very high.[88]
An Asian coffee known as kopi_luwak undergoes a peculiar process made from
coffee berries eaten by the Asian_palm_civet, passing through its digestive
tract, with the beans eventually harvested from feces. Coffee brewed from this
process[89] is among the most expensive in the world, with bean prices reaching
$160 per pound[90] or $30 per brewed cup.[91] Kopi luwak coffee is said to have
uniquely rich, slightly smoky aroma and flavor with hints of chocolate,
resulting from the action of digestive_enzymes breaking down bean proteins to
facilitate partial fermentation.[89][91]
**** Roasting ****
See also: Coffee_roasting
Roasted coffee beans.
The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee. Coffee is
usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted
before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be
home_roasted.[92] The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by
changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in
weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less
dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and
requirements for packaging.
The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches
approximately 200 Â°C (392 Â°F), though different varieties of seeds differ in
moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.[93] During
roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing
them to simple_sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the bean.
[94]
Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process, and may disappear entirely
in darker roasts. During roasting, aromatic oils and acids weaken, changing the
flavor; at 205 Â°C (401 Â°F), other oils start to develop.[93] One of these
oils, caffeol, is created at about 200 Â°C (392 Â°F), which is largely
responsible for coffee's aroma and flavor.[26]
Roasting is the last step of processing the beans in their intact state. During
this last treatment, while still in the bean state, more caffeine breaks down
above 235 Â°C (455 Â°F). Dark roasting is the utmost step in bean processing
removing the most caffeine. Although, dark roasting is not to be confused with
the Decaffeination process.
**** Grading roasted beans ****
See also: Food_grading
[Two_men_hold_spoons_over_a_row_of_cups_filled_with_coffee.]
Coffee "cuppers", or professional tasters, grade the coffee.
Depending on the color of the roasted beans as perceived by the human eye, they
will be labeled as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very
dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves
measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light
source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process
known as spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the
roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.
**** Roast characteristics ****
The degree of roast has an effect upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts
are generally bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary
flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger
flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting
times.[95] Roasting does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does
give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans
expand during roasting.[96]
A small amount of chaff is produced during roasting from the skin left on the
seed after processing.[97] Chaff is usually removed from the seeds by air
movement, though a small amount is added to dark roast coffees to soak up oils
on the seeds.[93]
**** Decaffeination ****
Decaffeination of coffee seeds is done while the seeds are still green. Many
methods can remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve either soaking the
green seeds in hot water (often called the "Swiss water process")[98] or
steaming them, then using a solvent to dissolve caffeine-containing oils.[26]
Decaffeination is often done by processing companies, and the extracted
caffeine is usually sold to the pharmaceutical industry.[26]
**** Storage ****
Main article: Coffee_bean_storage
Coffee container
Coffee is best stored in an airtight container made of ceramic, glass or non-
reactive metal.[99] Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way
valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release
gases.[100] Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored away
from moisture, heat, and light.[99] The ability of coffee to absorb strong
smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells.[99]
Storage of coffee in refrigerators is not recommended due to the presence of
moisture which can cause deterioration.[99] Exterior walls of buildings which
face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee
stored near such a wall.[99] Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.
[99]
In 1931, a method of packing coffee in a sealed vacuum in cans was introduced.
The roasted coffee was packed and then 99% of the air was removed, allowing the
coffee to be stored indefinitely until the can was opened. Today this method is
in mass use for coffee in a large part of the world.[101]
**** Brewing ****
See also: Coffee_preparation
A contemporary automatic coffeemaker.
Coffee beans must be ground and brewed to create a beverage. The criteria for
choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost all methods of preparing
coffee require that the beans be ground and then mixed with hot water long
enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not so long as to draw out bitter
compounds. The liquid can be consumed after the spent grounds are removed.
Brewing considerations include the fineness of grind, the way in which the
water is used to extract the flavor, the ratio of coffee grounds to water (the
brew ratio), additional flavorings such as sugar, milk, and spices, and the
technique to be used to separate spent grounds. Ideal holding temperatures
range from 85â88 Â°C (185â190 Â°F) to as high as 93 Â°C (199 Â°F) and the
ideal serving temperature is 68 to 79 Â°C (154 to 174 Â°F).[102] The
recommended brew ratio for non-espresso coffee is around 55 to 60 grams of
grounds per litre of water, or two level tablespoons for a 5- or 6-ounce cup.
[103]
The roasted coffee beans may be ground at a roastery, in a grocery store, or in
the home. Most coffee is roasted and ground at a roastery and sold in packaged
form, though roasted coffee beans can be ground at home immediately before
consumption. It is also possible, though uncommon, to roast raw beans at home.
Coffee beans may be ground in various ways. A burr_grinder uses revolving
elements to shear the seed; a blade_grinder cuts the seeds with blades moving
at high speed; and a mortar and pestle crushes the seeds. For most brewing
methods a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is more even and
the grind size can be adjusted.
The type of grind is often named after the brewing method for which it is
generally used. Turkish_grind is the finest grind, while coffee_percolator or
French_press are the coarsest grinds. The most common grinds are between these
two extremes: a medium grind is used in most home coffee-brewing machines.[104]
Coffee may be brewed by several methods. It may be boiled, steeped, or
pressurized. Brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method, and Turkish
coffee is an example of this method.[105] It is prepared by grinding or
pounding the seeds to a fine powder, then adding it to water and bringing it to
the boil for no more than an instant in a pot called a cezve or, in Greek, a
brÃ­ki. This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and
sediment (which is not meant for drinking) settling at the bottom of the cup.
[105]
Coffee percolators and automatic_coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an
automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds that are held in a
paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee_filter, allowing the water to seep
through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. The liquid
drips through the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent
grounds are retained in the filter.[106]
In a percolator, boiling water is forced into a chamber above a filter by steam
pressure created by boiling. The water then seeps through the grounds, and the
process is repeated until terminated by removing from the heat, by an internal
timer,[106] or by a thermostat that turns off the heater when the entire pot
reaches a certain temperature.
Coffee may be brewed by steeping in a device such as a French press (also known
as a cafetiÃ¨re, coffee press or coffee plunger).[107] Ground coffee and hot
water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes.
A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then
pushed down from the top to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains
the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because
the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils
remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing
leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine.[107]
Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be
minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade
grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine
coffee dust that remains as sludge at the bottom of the cup, while a burr
grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the
coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press.[108] Within the first
minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.
[citation_needed]
The espresso method forces hot pressurized and vaporized water through ground
coffee. As a result of brewing under high pressure (ideally between 9â10
atm), the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the
quantity of coffee to water as gravity-brewing methods can produce) and has a
more complex physical and chemical constitution.[109] A well-prepared espresso
has a reddish-brown foam called crema that floats on the surface.[104] Other
pressurized water methods include the moka_pot and vacuum_coffee_maker.
Cold_brew_coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground beans in cold water for
several hours, then filtering them.[110] This results in a brew lower in
acidity than most hot-brewing methods.
**** Nutrition ****
Brewed_coffee from typical grounds prepared with tap water contains 40 mg
caffeine per 100 gram and no essential_nutrients in significant content.[111]
In espresso, however, likely due to its higher amount of suspended solids,
there are significant contents of magnesium, the B_vitamins, niacin and
riboflavin, and 212 mg of caffeine per 100 grams of grounds.[112]
**** Serving ****

Enjoying coffee, painting by unknown artist in the Pera_Museum.
Once brewed, coffee may be served in a variety of ways. Drip-brewed,
percolated, or French-pressed/cafetiÃ¨re coffee may be served as white coffee
with a dairy product such as milk or cream, or dairy substitute, or as black
coffee with no such addition. It may be sweetened with sugar or artificial
sweetener. When served cold, it is called iced_coffee.
Espresso-based coffee has a variety of possible presentations. In its most
basic form, an espresso is served alone as a shot or short black, or with hot
water added, when it is known as CaffÃ¨_Americano. A long_black is made by
pouring a double espresso into an equal portion of water, retaining the crema,
unlike CaffÃ¨ Americano.[113] Milk is added in various forms to an espresso:
steamed milk makes a caffÃ¨_latte,[114] equal parts steamed milk and milk froth
make a cappuccino,[113] and a dollop of hot foamed milk on top creates a caffÃ¨
macchiato.[115] A flat_white is prepared by adding steamed hot milk (microfoam)
to espresso so that the flavour is brought out and the texture is unusually
velvety.[116][117] It has less milk than a latte but both are varieties of
coffee to which the milk can be added in such a way as to create a decorative
surface pattern. Such effects are known as latte_art.
Coffee can also be incorporated with alcohol to produce a variety of beverages:
it is combined with whiskey in Irish_coffee, and it forms the base of alcoholic
coffee liqueurs such as KahlÃºa and Tia_Maria. Darker beers such as stout and
porter give a chocolate or coffee-like taste due to roasted grains even though
actual coffee beans are not added to it.[118][119]
**** Instant coffee ****
Main article: Instant_coffee
Instant coffee
A number of products are sold for the convenience of consumers who do not want
to prepare their own coffee or who do not have access to coffeemaking
equipment. Instant coffee is dried into soluble powder or freeze-dried into
granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water.[120] Originally invented
in 1907,[121][122] it rapidly gained in popularity in many countries in the
post-war period, with NescafÃ© being the most popular product.[123] Many
consumers determined that the convenience in preparing a cup of instant coffee
more than made up for a perceived inferior taste,[124] although, since the late
1970s, instant coffee has been produced differently in such a way that is
similar to the taste of freshly brewed coffee.[citation_needed] Paralleling
(and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee_vending
machine invented in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.[125]
Canned_coffee has been popular in Asian countries for many years, particularly
in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Vending machines typically sell
varieties of flavored canned coffee, much like brewed or percolated coffee,
available both hot and cold. Japanese convenience stores and groceries also
have a wide availability of bottled coffee drinks, which are typically lightly
sweetened and pre-blended with milk. Bottled coffee drinks are also consumed in
the United States.[126]
Liquid coffee concentrates are sometimes used in large institutional situations
where coffee needs to be produced for thousands of people at the same time. It
is described as having a flavor about as good as low-grade robusta coffee, and
costs about 10Â¢ a cup to produce. The machines can process up to 500 cups an
hour, or 1,000 if the water is preheated.[127]
***** Sale and distribution *****
Main article: Economics_of_coffee
Brazilian_coffee sacks.
Coffee ingestion on average is about a third of that of tap_water in North
America and Europe. Worldwide, 6.7 million metric_tons of coffee were produced
annually in 1998â2000, and the forecast is a rise to seven million metric
tons annually by 2010.[128]
Brazil remains the largest coffee exporting nation, however Vietnam tripled its
exports between 1995 and 1999 and became a major producer of robusta seeds.
[129] Indonesia is the third-largest coffee exporter overall and the largest
producer of washed arabica coffee. Organic Honduran coffee is a rapidly growing
emerging commodity owing to the Honduran climate and rich soil.
In 2013, The_Seattle_Times reported that global coffee prices dropped more than
50 percent year-over-year.[130] The downward trend continued, and in September
2018 coffee futures dropped to a 12-year low, below the cost of production for
many farmers in mountainous regions who cannot use mechanized harvesting
methods.[131]
In Thailand, black ivory coffee beans are fed to elephants whose digestive
enzymes reduce the bitter taste of beans collected from dung.[132] These beans
sell for up to $1,100 a kilogram ($500 per lb), achieving the world's most
expensive coffee[132] some three times costlier than beans harvested from the
dung of Asian_palm_civets.[90][91]
**** Commodity market ****
Coffee distribution
Coffee is bought and sold as green coffee beans by roasters, investors, and
price speculators as a tradable commodity in commodity_markets and exchange-
traded_funds. Coffee futures_contracts for Grade 3 washed arabicas are traded
on the New_York_Mercantile_Exchange under ticker symbol KC, with contract
deliveries occurring every year in March, May, July, September, and December.
[133] Coffee is an example of a product that has been susceptible to
significant commodity futures price variations.[134][135] Higher and lower
grade arabica coffees are sold through other channels. Futures contracts for
robusta coffee are traded on the London_International_Financial_Futures_and
Options_Exchange and, since 2007, on the New York Intercontinental_Exchange.
Dating to the 1970s, coffee has been incorrectly described by many, including
historian Mark_Pendergrast, as the world's "second most legally traded
commodity".[136][137] Instead, "coffee was the second most valuable commodity
exported by developing countries," from 1970 to circa 2000.[138] This fact was
derived from the United_Nations_Conference_on_Trade_and_Development Commodity
Yearbooks which show "Third World" commodity exports by value in the period
1970â1998 as being in order of crude oil in first place, coffee in second,
followed by sugar, cotton, and others. Coffee continues to be an important
commodity export for developing countries, but more recent figures are not
readily available due to the shifting and politicized nature of the category
"developing country".[136]
International_Coffee_Day, which is claimed to have originated in Japan in 1983
with an event organized by the All Japan Coffee Association, takes place on
September 29 in several countries.[139][140][141]
**** Industry advocacy ****
Organizations funded by the coffee industry include the International_Coffee
Organization,[142] the National_Coffee_Association[143] and the British Coffee
Association.[144]
**** Consumption ****
Nordic_countries are the highest coffee consuming nations, with consumption in
Finland as the world's highest (12 kilograms (26 lb) per person per year).[145]
***** Health effects *****
A 2017 review of clinical_trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe
within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes
than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include
possible increased risk in women having bone_fractures, and a possible
increased risk in pregnant women of fetal_loss or decreased_birth_weight.[5]
Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender,
health status, and serving size.[5]
**** Mortality ****
In 2012, the National_Institutes_of_HealthâAARP Diet and Health Study
analysed the relationship between coffee drinking and mortality. They found
that higher coffee consumption was associated with lower risk of death, and
that those who drank any coffee lived longer than those who did not. However
the authors noted, "whether this was a causal or associational finding cannot
be determined from our data."[146] A 2014 meta-analysis found that coffee
consumption (4 cups/day) was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (a
16% lower risk), as well as cardiovascular_disease mortality specifically (a
21% lower risk from drinking 3 cups/day), but not with cancer mortality.[147]
Additional meta-analysis studies corroborated these findings, showing that
higher coffee consumption (2â4 cups per day) was associated with a reduced
risk of death by all disease causes.[148][149] An association of coffee
drinking with reduced risk for death from various sources was confirmed by a
widely cited prospective cohort study of ten European countries in 2017.[150]
**** Cardiovascular disease ****
Moderate coffee consumption is not a risk factor for coronary_heart_disease.
[151] A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of
coffee had a lower rate of heart_failure, with the biggest effect found for
those who drank more than four cups a day.[152] A 2014 meta-analysis concluded
that cardiovascular_disease, such as coronary artery disease and stroke, is
less likely with three to five cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day, but
more likely with over five cups per day.[153] A 2016 meta-analysis showed that
coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients who
have had a myocardial_infarction.[154]
Drinking four or more cups of coffee per day does not affect the risk of
hypertension compared to drinking little or no coffee; however, drinking one to
three cups per day may be at a slightly increased risk.[155]
**** Mental health ****
The UK NHS advises that avoiding coffee may reduce anxiety.[156] Caffeine, the
major active ingredient in coffee, is associated with anxiety.[157][158] At
high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen
anxiety.[159] For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly
reduce anxiety.[160] Caffeine-induced_anxiety_disorder is a subclass of
substance- or medication-induced anxiety_disorder.[161] Populations that may be
most impacted by caffeine consumption are adolescents and those already
suffering anxiety disorders.[162] Preliminary research indicated the
possibility of a beneficial relationship between coffee intake and reduced
depression.[5][163][164] Long-term preliminary research, including assessment
of symptoms for dementia and cognitive_impairment, was inconclusive for coffee
having an effect in the elderly, mainly due to the poor quality of the studies.
[5][165]
**** Parkinson's disease ****
Meta-analyses have consistently found that long-term coffee consumption is
associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's_disease.[5]
**** Type II diabetes ****
In a systematic_review and meta-analysis of 28 prospective observational
studies, representing over one million participants, every additional cup of
caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumed in a day was associated,
respectively, with a 9% and 6% lower risk of type_2_diabetes.[166]
**** Cancer ****
The effects of coffee consumption on cancer risk remain unclear, with reviews
and meta-analyses showing either no relationship[167][168] or a slightly lower
risk of cancer onset.[169][170] Studies suggest that coffee consumption of 2
cups per/day was associated with a 14% increased risk of developing lung
cancer, but only among people who smoke.[171]
***** Pharmacology *****
Skeletal_formula of a caffeine molecule.
One psychoactive chemical in coffee is caffeine, an adenosine_receptor
antagonist that is known for its stimulant effects.[172] Coffee also contains
the monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors Î²-carboline and harmane, which may contribute
to its psychoactivity.[173]
In a healthy liver, caffeine is mostly broken down by hepatic enzymes. The
excreted metabolites are mostly paraxanthinesâtheobromine and
theophyllineâand a small amount of unchanged caffeine. Therefore, the
metabolism of caffeine depends on the state of this enzymatic system of the
liver.[174]
Polyphenols in coffee have been shown to affect free_radicals in_vitro,[175]
but there is no evidence that this effect occurs in humans. Polyphenol levels
vary depending on how beans are roasted as well as for how long. As interpreted
by the Linus_Pauling_Institute and the European_Food_Safety_Authority, dietary
polyphenols, such as those ingested by consuming coffee, have little or no
direct antioxidant value following ingestion.[176][177][178]
***** Caffeine content *****
See also: Low_caffeine_coffee
Depending on the type of coffee and method of preparation, the caffeine content
of a single serving can vary greatly.[179][180][181][182] The caffeine content
of a cup of coffee varies depending mainly on the brewing method, and also on
the coffee variety.[183] According to the USDA_National_Nutrient_Database, an
8-ounce (237 ml) cup of "coffee brewed from grounds" contains 95 mg caffeine,
whereas an espresso (25 ml) contains 53 mg.[184]
According to an article in the Journal_of_the_American_Dietetic_Association,
coffee has the following caffeine content, depending on how it is prepared:
[180]
         Serving size           Caffeine content
Brewed   7 oz, 207 ml           80â135 mg
Drip     7 oz, 207 ml           115â175 mg
Espresso 1.5â2 oz, 45â100 mg
While the percent of caffeine content in coffee seeds themselves diminishes
with increased_roast_level, the opposite is true for coffee brewed from
different grinds and brewing methods using the same proportion of coffee to
water volume. The coffee sack (similar to the French_press and other steeping
methods) extracts more caffeine from dark roasted seeds; the percolator and
espresso methods extract more caffeine from light roasted seeds:[185][186][187]
                             Light roast Medium roast Dark roast
Coffee sack â coarse gr0.046       0.045        0.054
Percolator â coarse gri0.068       0.065        0.060
Espresso â fine grind  0.069       0.062        0.061
Coffea_arabica normally contains about half the caffeine of Coffea_robusta. A
Coffea arabica bean containing very little caffeine was discovered in Ethiopia
in 2004.[188]
***** Coffeehouses *****
See also: Coffeehouse for a social history of coffee, and caffÃ¨ for
specifically Italian traditions
A coffeehouse in Cairo, 18th century.
Widely known as coffeehouses or cafÃ©s, establishments serving prepared coffee
or other hot beverages have existed for over five hundred years.[citation
needed] Coffeehouses in Mecca became a concern as places for political
gatherings to the imams who banned them, and the drink, for Muslims between
1512 and 1524. In 1530 the first coffeehouse was opened in Damascus.[189] The
first coffeehouse in Constantinople was opened in 1475[190] by traders arriving
from Damascus and Aleppo. Soon after, coffeehouses became part of the Ottoman
Culture, spreading rapidly to all regions of the Ottoman_Empire.
CafÃ©_Central in Vienna, Austria. A staple of the Viennese_coffee_house
tradition, it has remained open since 1876.
In the 17th century, coffee appeared for the first time in Europe outside the
Ottoman Empire, and coffeehouses were established and quickly became popular.
The first coffeehouses in Western_Europe appeared in Venice, as a result of the
traffic between La_Serenissima and the Ottomans; the very first one is recorded
in 1645. The first coffeehouse in England was set up in Oxford in 1650 by a
Jewish man named Jacob in the building now known as "The Grand Cafe". A plaque
on the wall still commemorates this and the cafe is now a cocktail bar.[191] By
1675, there were more than 3,000 coffeehouses in England.[192]
A legend says that after the second Turkish_siege_of_Vienna in 1683, the
Viennese discovered many bags of coffee in the abandoned Ottoman encampment.
Using this captured stock, a Polish soldier named Kulczycki opened the first
coffeehouse_in_Vienna. This story never happened. Nowadays it is proven that
the first coffeehouse in Vienna was opened by the Armenian Johannes Theodat in
1685.[193][194]
In 1672 an Armenian named Pascal established a coffee stall in Paris that was
ultimately unsuccessful and the city had to wait until 1689 for its first
coffeehouse when Procopio_CutÃ² opened the CafÃ©_Procope. This coffeehouse
still exists today and was a major meeting place of the French Enlightenment;
Voltaire, Rousseau, and Denis_Diderot frequented it, and it is arguably the
birthplace of the EncyclopÃ©die, the first modern encyclopedia.[195] America
had its first coffeehouse in Boston, in 1676.[196] Coffee, tea and beer were
often served together in establishments which functioned both as coffeehouses
and taverns; one such was the Green Dragon in Boston, where John_Adams, James
Otis, and Paul_Revere planned rebellion.[33]
First patent for the espresso machine, Angelo Moriondo (1884).
The modern steamless espresso_machine was invented in Milan, Italy, in 1938 by
Achille_Gaggia,[197] and from there spread in coffeehouses and restaurants
across Italy and the rest of Europe in the early 1950s. An Italian named Pino
Riservato opened the first espresso bar, the Moka Bar, in Soho in 1952, and
there were 400 such bars in London alone by 1956. Cappucino was particularly
popular among English drinkers.[198] Similarly in the United States, the
espresso craze spread. North_Beach in San Francisco saw the opening of the
Caffe Trieste in 1957, which served Beat_Generation poets such as Allen
Ginsberg and Bob_Kaufman alongside Italian immigrants.[198] Similar such cafes
existed in Greenwich Village and elsewhere.[198]
The first Peet's_Coffee_&_Tea store opened in 1966 in Berkeley, California by
Dutch native Alfred_Peet. He chose to focus on roasting batches with fresher,
higher quality seeds than was the norm at the time. He was a trainer and
supplier to the founders of Starbuck's.[199]
The American coffeehouse chain Starbucks, which began as a modest business
roasting and selling coffee beans in 1971, was founded by three college
students, Jerry_Baldwin, Gordon_Bowker, and Zev_Siegl. The first store opened
on March 30, 1971 at the Pike_Place_Market in Seattle, followed by a second and
third over the next two years.[200] Entrepreneur Howard_Schultz joined the
company in 1982 as Director of Retail Operations and Marketing, and pushed to
sell premade espresso coffee. The others were reluctant, but Schultz opened Il
Giornale in Seattle in April 1986.[201] He bought the other owners out in March
1987 and pushed on with plans to expandâfrom 1987 to the end of 1991, the
chain (rebranded from Il Giornale to Starbucks) expanded to over 100 outlets.
[202] The company has 25,000 stores in over 75 countries worldwide.[203]
South Korea experienced almost 900 percent growth in the number of coffee shops
in the country between 2006 and 2011. The capital city Seoul now has the
highest concentration of coffee shops in the world, with more than 10,000 cafes
and coffeehouses.[204]
A contemporary term for a person who makes coffee beverages, often a
coffeehouse employee, is a barista. The Specialty Coffee Association of Europe
and the Specialty Coffee Association of America have been influential in
setting standards and providing training.[205]
***** Society and culture *****
Main article: Coffee_culture
Davoser CafÃ© by Ernst_Ludwig_Kirchner, 1928.
Coffee is often consumed alongside (or instead of) breakfast by many at home or
when eating out at diners or cafeterias. It is often served at the end of a
formal meal, normally with a dessert, and at times with an after-dinner mint,
especially when consumed at a restaurant or dinner party.[206][207]
**** Break ****
A coffee_break in the United States and elsewhere is a short mid-morning rest
period granted to employees in business and industry, corresponding with the
Commonwealth terms "elevenses", "smoko" (in Australia), "morning tea", "tea
break", or even just "tea". An afternoon coffee break, or afternoon_tea, often
occurs as well.
The coffee break originated in the late 19th century in Stoughton,_Wisconsin,
with the wives of Norwegian immigrants. The city celebrates this every year
with the Stoughton Coffee Break Festival.[208] In 1951, Time noted that "
[s]ince the war, the coffee break has been written into union contracts".[209]
The term subsequently became popular through a Pan-American Coffee Bureau ad
campaign of 1952 which urged consumers, "Give yourself a Coffee-Break â and
Get What Coffee Gives to You."[210] John_B._Watson, a behavioral psychologist
who worked with Maxwell_House later in his career, helped to popularize coffee
breaks within the American culture.[211] Coffee breaks usually last from 10 to
20 minutes and frequently occur at the end of the first third of the work
shift. In some companies and some civil_service, the coffee break may be
observed formally at a set hour. In some places, a cart with hot and cold
beverages and cakes, breads and pastries arrives at the same time morning and
afternoon, an employer may contract with an outside caterer for daily service,
or coffee breaks may take place away from the actual work-area in a designated
cafeteria or tea_room. More generally, the phrase "coffee break" has also come
to denote any break from work.
**** Prohibition ****
The Coffee Bearer, Orientalist painting by John_Frederick_Lewis (1857).
Coffee was initially used for spiritual reasons. At least 1,100 years ago,
traders brought coffee across the Red_Sea into Arabia (modern-day Yemen), where
Muslim dervishes began cultivating the shrub in their gardens. At first, the
Arabians made wine from the pulp of the fermented coffee berries. This beverage
was known as qishr (kisher in modern usage) and was used during religious
ceremonies.[212]
Coffee drinking was prohibited by jurists and scholars (ulema) meeting in Mecca
in 1511 as haraam, but the subject of whether it was intoxicating was hotly
debated over the next 30 years until the ban was finally overturned in the mid-
16th_century.[213] Use in religious rites among the Sufi branch of Islam led to
coffee's being put on trial in Mecca: it was accused of being a heretical
substance, and its production and consumption were briefly repressed. It was
later prohibited in Ottoman Turkey under an edict by the Sultan_Murad_IV.[214]
Coffee, regarded as a Muslim drink, was prohibited by Ethiopian_Orthodox
Christians until as late as 1889; it is now considered a national drink of
Ethiopia for people of all faiths. Its early association in Europe with
rebellious political activities led to Charles_II outlawing coffeehouses from
January 1676 (although the uproar created forced the monarch to back down two
days before the ban was due to come into force).[33] Frederick_the_Great banned
it in Prussia in 1777 for nationalistic and economic reasons; concerned about
the price of import, he sought to force the public back to consuming beer.[215]
Lacking coffee-producing colonies, Prussia had to import all its coffee at a
great cost.[216]
A contemporary example of religious prohibition of coffee can be found in The
Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints.[217] The organization holds that
it is both physically and spiritually unhealthy to consume coffee.[218] This
comes from the Mormon doctrine of health, given in 1833 by founder Joseph_Smith
in a revelation called the Word_of_Wisdom. It does not identify coffee by name,
but includes the statement that "hot drinks are not for the belly," which has
been interpreted to forbid both coffee and tea.[218]
Quite a number of members of the Seventh-day_Adventist_Church also avoid
caffeinated drinks. In its teachings, the Church encourages members to avoid
tea, coffee, and other stimulants. Abstinence from coffee, tobacco, and alcohol
by many Adventists has afforded a near-unique opportunity for studies to be
conducted within that population group on the health effects of coffee
drinking, free from confounding factors. One study was able to show a weak but
statistically_significant association between coffee consumption and mortality
from ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular_disease, all cardiovascular
diseases combined, and all causes of death.[219]
For a time, there had been controversy in the Jewish community over whether the
coffee seed was a legume and therefore prohibited for Passover. Upon petition
from coffeemaker Maxwell_House, the coffee seed was classified in 1923 as a
berry rather than a seed by orthodox Jewish rabbi Hersch Kohn, and therefore
kosher for Passover.[220]
**** Fair trade ****
Main article: Fair_trade_coffee
See also: Fair_trade_debate
Small-sized bag of coffee beans.
The concept of fair_trade labeling, which guarantees coffee growers a
negotiated preharvest price, began in the late 1980s with the Max_Havelaar
Foundation's labeling program in the Netherlands. In 2004, 24,222 metric tons
(of 7,050,000 produced worldwide) were fair trade; in 2005, 33,991 metric tons
out of 6,685,000 were fair trade, an increase from 0.34% to 0.51%.[221][222] A
number of fair_trade_impact_studies have shown that fair trade coffee produces
a mixed impact on the communities that grow it. Many studies are skeptical
about fair trade, reporting that it often worsens the bargaining power of those
who are not part of it. Coffee was incorporated into the fair-trade movement in
1988, when the Max_Havelaar mark was introduced in the Netherlands. The very
first fair-trade coffee was an effort to import a Guatemalan coffee into Europe
as "Indio Solidarity Coffee".[223]
Since the founding of organizations such as the European_Fair_Trade_Association
(1987), the production and consumption of fair trade coffee has grown as some
local and national coffee chains started to offer fair trade alternatives.[224]
[225] For example, in April 2000, after a year-long campaign by the human
rights organization Global_Exchange, Starbucks decided to carry fair-trade
coffee in its stores.[226] Since September 2009 all Starbucks Espresso
beverages in UK and Ireland are made with Fairtrade and Shared Planet certified
coffee.[227]
A 2005 study done in Belgium concluded that consumers' buying behavior is not
consistent with their positive attitude toward ethical products. On average 46%
of European consumers claimed to be willing to pay substantially more for
ethical products, including fair-trade products such as coffee.[226] The study
found that the majority of respondents were unwilling to pay the actual price
premium of 27% for fair trade coffee.[226]
**** Folklore and culture ****
The Oromo_people would customarily plant a coffee tree on the graves of
powerful sorcerers. They believed that the first coffee bush sprang up from the
tears that the god of heaven shed over the corpse of a dead sorcerer.[228]
Johann_Sebastian_Bach was inspired to compose the humorous Coffee_Cantata,
about dependence_on_the_beverage.[229]
**** Economic impacts ****
Further information: List_of_countries_by_coffee_production
Map of coffee areas in Brazil.
Market volatility, and thus increased returns, during 1830 encouraged Brazilian
entrepreneurs to shift their attention from gold to coffee, a crop hitherto
reserved for local consumption. Concurrent with this shift was the
commissioning of vital infrastructures, including approximately 7,000 km of
railroads between 1860 and 1885. The creation of these railways enabled the
importation of workers, in order to meet the enormous need for labor. This
development primarily affected the State_of_Rio_de_Janeiro, as well as the
Southern States of Brazil, most notably SÃ£o_Paulo, due to its favorable
climate, soils, and terrain.[230]
Coffee_production attracted immigrants in search of better economic
opportunities in the early 1900s. Mainly, these were Portuguese, Italian,
Spanish, German, and Japanese nationals. For instance, SÃ£o Paulo received
approximately 733,000 immigrants in the decade preceding 1900, whilst only
receiving approximately 201,000 immigrants in the six years to 1890. The
production yield of coffee increases. In 1880, SÃ£o Paulo produced 1.2 million
bags (25% of total production), in 1888 2.6 million (40%), in 1902 8 million
bags (60%).[231] Coffee is then 63% of the country's exports. The gains made by
this trade allow sustained economic growth in the country.
The four years between planting a coffee and the first harvest extends seasonal
variations in the price of coffee. The Brazilian_Government is thus forced, to
some extent, to keep strong price subsidies during production periods.
**** Competition ****
Coffee competitions take place across the globe with people at the regional
competing to achieve national titles and then compete on the international
stage. World Coffee Events holds the largest of such events moving the location
of the final competition each year. The competition includes the following
events: Barista Championship, Brewers Cup, Latte Art and Cup Tasters. A World
Brewer's_Cup Championship takes place in Melbourne,_Australia, every year that
houses contestants from around the world[232] to crown the World's Coffee King.

      from his warehouse, if they would come and help him sort the tobacco. The
      women agreed, as long as they could have a break in the morning and
      another in the afternoon, to go home and tend to their chores. Of course,
      this also meant they were free to have a cup of coffee from the pot that
      was always hot on the stove. Mr. Gunderson agreed and with this simple
