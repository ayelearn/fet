***** Description[edit] *****
Ghee is typically prepared by simmering butter, which is churned from cream
(traditionally made by churning dahi), skimming any impurities from the
surface, then pouring and retaining the clear liquid fat while discarding the
solid residue that has settled to the bottom. Spices can be added for flavor.
The texture, color and taste of ghee depends on the quality of the butter, the
milk source used in the process and the duration of time spent boiling.
***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word ghee comes from Sanskrit: à¤à¥à¤¤ (ghá¹ta-, IPA: [É¡Ê±rÌ©tÉ])
'clarified butter', from ghá¹- 'to sprinkle'.[1]
***** In Hinduism[edit] *****
Traditionally, ghee (Sanskrit: à¤à¥à¤à¥à¤¤, go-ghá¹ta) is always made from
bovine milk, as cows are considered sacred, and it is a sacred requirement in
Vedic yajÃ±a and homa (fire rituals), through the medium of Agni (fire) to
offer oblations to various deities. (See Yajurveda).
Fire rituals have been performed dating back over 5,000 years[citation_needed].
They are thought to be auspicious for ceremonies such as marriage, funerals,
etc. Ghee is also necessary in Vedic worship of mÅ«rtis (divine deities), with
aarti (offering of ghee lamp) calleddiyÄ or dÄ«pa and for PaÃ±cÄmá¹ta
(Panchamruta) where ghee along with mishri (mishri is different from sugar),
honey, milk, and dahi (curd) is used for bathing the deities on the appearance
day of Krishna on Janmashtami, Åiva (Shiva) on MahÄ-ÅivarÄtrÄ« (Maha
Shivaratri). There is a hymn to ghee.[2]
In the Mahabharata, the kaurava were born from pots of ghee.[3] Finding ghee
pure enough to use for sacred purposes is a problem these days for devout
Hindus, since many large-scale producers add salt to their product.[citation
needed] Ghee is also used in bhang in order to heat the cannabis to cause
decarboxylation, making the drink psychoactive.[4][5]
***** Culinary uses[edit] *****
A dosa in India served with ghee.
Bottled ghee, Fiji.
Ghee is common in cuisines from the Indian_subcontinent, including traditional
rice preparations (such as biryani). In Maharashtra, polis or Indian breads are
accompanied with ghee. For example, 'Puranpoli', a typical Maharashtrian dish
is eaten with lots of ghee. In Rajasthan, ghee often accompanies baati. All
over north India, ghee tops roti. In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, ghee tops dosa,
and kesari_bhath. In Bengal (both West Bengal and Bangladesh) and Gujarat,
khichdi is a traditional evening meal of rice with lentils, cooked in curry
made from dahi (yogurt), cumin seeds, curry_leaves, cornflour, turmeric,
garlic, salt and ghee. It is also an ingredient in kadhi and Indian_sweets,
such as Mysore_pak and varieties of halva and laddu. Pakistani and Punjabi
restaurants typically incorporate large amounts of ghee, sometimes brushing
naan and roti with it, either during preparation or just before serving. In the
state of Odisha ghee is widely used in regional Odia cusines such as 'Khechedi'
and 'Dalma'. Particularly the satwik type of food prepared in almost temples in
Odisha use a ghee as a major ingredient for their culnary skills. Ghee is
widely used in South Indian cuisine for tempering curries, in preparation of
rice dishes and sweets. South Indians have a habit of adding ghee to their rice
before eating it with pickles and curries. South Indians are one of the biggest
consumers of ghee. The people from Telangana and Andhra_Pradesh especially use
ghee for preparation of savoury and sweet dishes alike. Ghee is important to
traditional Punjabi cuisine, with parathas, daals and curries often using ghee
instead of oil for a richer taste. The type of ghee, in terms of animal source,
tends to vary with the dish; for example, ghee prepared from cow's milk
(Bengali: à¦à¦¾à¦à¦¯à¦¼à¦¾ à¦à§, gaoa ghi) is traditional with rice or roti
or as a finishing drizzle atop a curry or daal (lentils) whereas buffalo-milk
ghee is more typical for general cooking purposes.
Ghee is an ideal fat for deep_frying because its smoke_point (where its
molecules begin to break down) is 250 Â°C (482 Â°F), which is well above
typical cooking temperatures of around 200 Â°C (392 Â°F) and above that of most
vegetable oils.[6]
***** Flavor[edit] *****
The main flavor components of ghee are carbonyls, free_fatty_acids, lactones,
and alcohols.[7] Along with the flavor of milk fat, the ripening of the butter
and temperature at which it is clarified also affect the flavor. For example,
ghee produced by the clarification of butter at 100 Â°C or less results in a
mild flavor, whereas batches produced at 120 Â°C produce a strong flavor.

Ghee differs slightly in its production. The process of creating traditional
clarified butter is complete once the water is evaporated and the fat
(clarified butter) is separated from the milk solids. However, the production
of ghee includes simmering the butter, which makes it nutty-tasting and
aromatic.[8][9][10][11]
A traditional Ayurvedic recipe for ghee is to boil raw milk, let it cool to
110 Â°F (43 Â°C). After letting it sit covered at room temperature for around
12 hours, add a bit of dahi (yogurt) to it and let it sit overnight. This makes
more yogurt. This is churned with water, to obtain cultured butter, which is
used to simmer into ghee.[12]

Ayurveda considers pure ghee to be sÄttvik or sattva-guá¹i (in the "mode of
goodness"), when used as food. It is the main ingredient in some of the
Ayurvedic medicines, and is included under catuh mahÄ sneha (the four main
oils: ghá¹ta, taila, vasÄ, and majjÄ) along with sesame_oil, muscle fat, and
bone_marrow. Though eight types of ghee are mentioned in Ayurvedic classics,
ghee made of human_breast_milk and cow's ghee are favored. Ghee is also used in
Ayurvedas for constipation and ulcers.
In Sri_Lankan indigenous medical traditions (DeshÄ«ya CikitsÄ), ghee is
included in pas tel (five oils: ghee, margosa oil, sesame oil, castor_oil, and
butter tree oil).

***** Nutrition[edit] *****
Like any clarified butter, ghee is composed almost entirely of fat, 62% of
which consists of saturated_fats.[13] It is also rich in oxidized cholesterol:
259 Î¼g/g, or 12.3% of total cholesterol.[14][15] Ghee is also sometimes called
desi (country-made) ghee or asli (genuine) ghee to distinguish it from the
modern "vegetable_ghee".

Several communities outside the Indian_subcontinent make ghee. Egyptians make a
product called samna baladi, meaning "countryside butter" identical to ghee in
terms of process and result, but commonly made from water_buffalo milk instead
of cow milk, and white in color. Also, during the process, the darkened milk
solids are considered a delicacy called morta which is a salty condiment used
sparingly as a spread, or as an addition on fava dishes. Regular samna is also
made from cow milk in Egypt and is often yellowish.
Ghee is also used by various peoples in the Horn_of_Africa. Tesmi (in Tigrinya
language) is the clarified butter prepared in the country of Eritrea. The
preparation is similar to that of ghee but the butter is oftentimes combined
with garlic and other spices found native to the area. In Ethiopia, niter
kibbeh is used in much the same way as ghee, but with spices added during the
process that result in distinctive tastes. In North_Africa, Maghrebis take this
one step further, aging spiced ghee for months or even years, resulting in a
product called smen.
In northeastern_Brazil, an unrefrigerated butter similar to ghee, called
manteiga-de-garrafa (butter-in-a-bottle) or manteiga-da-terra (butter of the
land), is common.
In Switzerland as well as bordering areas, butter was rendered in the old days
to preserve the product for several months without refrigeration. "Boiled
butter", as it is commonly called, is used extensively to finish a typical dish
of rÃ¶sti, the Swiss version of hash browns. It gives the dish a distinct
flavor in baking of various pastor use in baked goods as a substitute for fresh
butter to enhance flavor.

There are 4 common methods through which ghee is prepared. Industrial
preparation on the other hand by FMCG companies such as Patanjali is done by
using "white butter", usually sourced from other dairies and contractors.[16]
[In_the_cream_butter_method,_cream_separated_from_milk_must_be_churned_to
produced_butter._The_butter_then_undergoes_heat_clarification.]
In the cream butter method, cream is separated from milk and churned to
produced butter. The butter then undergoes heat clarification.
**** Milk butter[edit] ****
Sour raw_milk is churned into butter. The butter is boiled in an open pan to
allow the water to evaporate. The hot ghee is transferred and stored.
**** Direct cream[edit] ****
Fresh cream, cultured or washed cream is directly converted to ghee. This
method requires a long heating time and produces a caramelized flavor.
**** Cream butter[edit] ****
Milk is separated into cream which is then churned into butter. The butter
undergoes heat clarification to produce ghee.
**** Pre-stratification[edit] ****
Suitable for large quantities of butter. Butter is melted at 80-85 Â°C for 30
minutes. Layers of protein particles, fat and buttermilk are induced. The
buttermilk is drained out. The remaining layers of fat are heated to a
temperature of 110 Â°C to remove moisture and develop flavor.[17]
***** Packaging[edit] *****
Ghee may be packaged in airtight glass jars and stored without refrigeration.
Ghee is generally found to be packaged in airtight glass jars. They should be
kept away from direct sunlight as sunlight can cause moisture to build inside
the jar. Moisture can cause deterioration to the ghee's quality as well as
reduce its shelf_life. To prevent the acceleration of the oxidation_process,
they should be protected from anything that causes it, such as UV_rays from the
sunlight and fluorescent lights. If the jar is unopened, it does not need to be
refrigerated as long as the previously mentioned conditions are met. Once
opened, they can be stored in a kitchen cabinet for up to 3 months. Afterwards,
it may be left in the refrigerator for up to a year. The refrigerator causes
ghee to harden but if it is left at room temperature for a while, it will
soften up again.[18]
***** Composition[edit] *****
Ghee may be made of milk from various domesticated ungulates, such as cows and
sheep.[19] The composition of ghee varies depending on the animal whose milk
has been used. The vitamin_A content ranged from 315 to 375 international units
per 100 grams.[19] Palmitic_acid and oleic_acid were two of the main fatty
acids found in both cow and sheep ghee. The saturated fatty acid profile was
53.9 to 66.8 percent, the unsaturated fatty acid profile was 22.8 to 38.0 and
the other fatty acids was 3.5 to 10.4.[19] Cholesterol amounts ranged from 252
to 284 mg/100 grams.[19]
***** Market[edit] *****
The market size of ghee in India is 10,000 crores 11 or US$1.5 Billion as of
2016. India is the world's largest producer of buffalo and cow milk and
consequently also the largest producer and consumer of ghee.[20][21]
