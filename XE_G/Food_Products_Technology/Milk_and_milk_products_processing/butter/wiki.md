Butter is a dairy_product with high butterfat content which is solid when
chilled and at room_temperature in some regions, and liquid when warmed. It is
made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat
from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread
products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, as well as in cooking, such as
baking, sauce making, and pan_frying. Butter consists of butterfat, milk
proteins and water, and often added salt.
Most frequently made from cow's milk, butter can also be manufactured from the
milk of other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, and yaks. Salt (such as
dairy_salt), flavorings (such as garlic) and preservatives are sometimes added
to butter. Rendering butter, removing the water and milk_solids, produces
clarified_butter or ghee, which is almost entirely butterfat.
Butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream,
where the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a firm solid when
refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room_temperature, and
melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32 to 35 Â°C (90 to 95 Â°F). The density
of butter is 911 grams per Litre (0.950 lb per US pint).[1] It generally has a
pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its natural,
unmodified color is dependent on the source animal's feed and genetics, but the
commercial manufacturing process commonly manipulates the color with food
colorings like annatto[2] or carotene.

***** Etymology *****
Butter is often served for spreading on bread with a butter_knife.
The word butter derives (via Germanic_languages) from the Latin butyrum,[3]
which is the latinisation of the Greek Î²Î¿ÏÏÏÏÎ¿Î½ (bouturon).[4][5] This
may be a compound of Î²Î¿á¿¦Ï (bous), "ox, cow"[6] + ÏÏÏÏÏ (turos),
"cheese", that is "cow-cheese".[7][8] The word turos ("cheese") is attested in
Mycenaean_Greek.[9] The unlatinized form is found in the name butyric_acid, a
compound found in rancid butter and dairy products such as Parmesan_cheese.
In general use, the term "butter" refers to the spread dairy product when
unqualified by other descriptors. The word commonly is used to describe purÃ©ed
vegetable or seed and nut products such as peanut_butter and almond_butter. It
is often applied to spread fruit_products such as apple_butter. Fats such as
cocoa_butter and shea_butter that remain solid at room temperature are also
known as "butters". Non-dairy items that have a dairy-butter consistency may
use "butter" to call that consistency to mind, including food items such as
maple_butter and witch's_butter and nonfood items such as baby_bottom_butter,
hyena_butter, and rock_butter.
***** Production *****
Main article: Churning_(butter)
Churning cream into butter using a hand-held mixer.
Unhomogenized milk and cream contain butterfat in microscopic globules. These
globules are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids (fatty_acid
emulsifiers) and proteins, which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together
into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these
membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from the other parts
of the cream. Variations in the production method will create butters with
different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the
finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free butterfat,
butterfat crystals, and undamaged fat globules. In the finished product,
different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within
the butter; butters with many crystals are harder than butters dominated by
free fats.
Churning produces small butter grains floating in the water-based portion of
the cream. This watery liquid is called buttermilkâalthough the buttermilk
most common today is instead a directly fermented skimmed milk. The buttermilk
is drained off; sometimes more buttermilk is removed by rinsing the grains with
water. Then the grains are "worked": pressed and kneaded together. When
prepared manually, this is done using wooden boards called scotch_hands. This
consolidates the butter into a solid mass and breaks up embedded pockets of
buttermilk or water into tiny droplets.
Commercial butter is about 80% butterfat and 15% water; traditionally made
butter may have as little as 65% fat and 30% water. Butterfat is a mixture of
triglyceride, a triester derived from glycerol and three of any of several
fatty_acid groups.[10] Butter becomes rancid when these chains break down into
smaller components, like butyric_acid and diacetyl. The density of butter is
0.911 g/cm3 (0.527 oz/in3), about the same as ice.
In some countries, butter is given_a_grade before commercial distribution.
***** Types *****
Before modern factory butter making, cream was usually collected from several
milkings and was therefore several days old and somewhat fermented by the time
it was made into butter. Butter made from a fermented cream is known as
cultured butter. During fermentation, the cream naturally sours as bacteria
convert milk_sugars into lactic_acid. The fermentation process produces
additional aroma compounds, including diacetyl, which makes for a fuller-
flavored and more "buttery" tasting product.[11](p35) Today, cultured butter is
usually made from pasteurized cream whose fermentation is produced by the
introduction of Lactococcus and Leuconostoc bacteria.
Chart of milk products and production relationships, including butter.
Another method for producing cultured butter, developed in the early 1970s, is
to produce butter from fresh cream and then incorporate bacterial cultures and
lactic acid. Using this method, the cultured butter flavor grows as the butter
is aged in cold storage. For manufacturers, this method is more efficient,
since aging the cream used to make butter takes significantly more space than
simply storing the finished butter product. A method to make an artificial
simulation of cultured butter is to add lactic acid and flavor compounds
directly to the fresh-cream butter; while this more efficient process is
claimed to simulate the taste of cultured butter, the product produced is not
cultured but is instead flavored.
Dairy products are often pasteurized during production to kill pathogenic
bacteria and other microbes. Butter made from pasteurized fresh cream is called
sweet cream butter. Production of sweet cream butter first became common in the
19th century, with the development of refrigeration and the mechanical cream
separator.[11](p33) Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is
called raw cream butter. While butter made from pasteurized cream may keep for
several months, raw cream butter has a shelf_life of roughly ten days.
Throughout continental_Europe, cultured butter is preferred, while sweet cream
butter dominates in the United States and the United_Kingdom. Cultured butter
is sometimes labeled "European-style" butter in the United States, although
cultured butter is made and sold by some, especially Amish, dairies. Commercial
raw cream butter is virtually unheard-of in the United States. Raw cream butter
is generally only found made at home by consumers who have purchased raw whole
milk directly from dairy farmers, skimmed the cream themselves, and made butter
with it. It is rare in Europe as well.[11](p34)
Several "spreadable" butters have been developed. These remain softer at colder
temperatures and are therefore easier to use directly out of refrigeration.
Some methods modify the makeup of the butter's fat through chemical
manipulation of the finished product, some manipulate the cattle's feed, and
some incorporate vegetable_oil into the butter. "Whipped" butter, another
product designed to be more spreadable, is aerated by incorporating nitrogen
gasânormal air is not used to avoid oxidation and rancidity.
All categories of butter are sold in both salted and unsalted forms. Either
granular salt or a strong brine are added to salted butter during processing.
In addition to enhanced flavor, the addition of salt acts as a preservative.
The amount of butterfat in the finished product is a vital aspect of
production. In the United States, products sold as "butter" must contain at
least 80% butterfat. In practice, most American butters contain slightly more
than that, averaging around 81% butterfat. European butters generally have a
higher ratioâup to 85%.
Liquid clarified_butter
Clarified_butter is butter with almost all of its water and milk solids
removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating
butter to its melting_point and then allowing it to cool; after settling, the
remaining components separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a
skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the
mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.[11](p37)
Ghee is clarified butter that has been heated to around 120 Â°C (250 Â°F) after
the water evaporated, turning the milk solids brown. This process flavors the
ghee, and also produces antioxidants that help protect it from rancidity.
Because of this, ghee can keep for six to eight months under normal conditions.

**** Whey butter ****
Butter made in a barn; German painting by Jan Spanjaert.
Cream may be separated (usually by a centrifugal separator) from whey instead
of milk, as a byproduct of cheese-making. Whey butter may be made from whey
cream. Whey cream and butter have a lower fat content and taste more salty,
tangy and "cheesy".[12] They are also cheaper than "sweet" cream and butter.
The fat content of whey is low, so 1000 pounds of whey will typically give 3
pounds of butter.[13][14]
**** European butters ****
There are several butters produced in Europe with protected_geographical
indications; these include:
    * Beurre_d'Ardenne, from Belgium
    * Beurre_d'Isigny, from France
    * Beurre_Charentes-Poitou (Which also includes: Beurre des Charentes and
      Beurre des Deux-SÃ¨vres under the same classification), from France
    * Beurre_Rose, from Luxembourg
    * Mantequilla_de_Soria, from Spain
    * Mantega_de_l'Alt_Urgell_i_la_Cerdanya, from Spain
    * Rucava_white_butter (Rucavas baltais sviests), from Latvia[15]
***** History *****
Traditional butter-making in Palestine. Ancient techniques were still practiced
in the early 20th century. National_Geographic, March 1914.
The earliest butter would have been from sheep or goat's milk; cattle are not
thought to have been domesticated for another thousand years.[16] An ancient
method of butter making, still used today in parts of Africa and the Near_East,
involves a goat skin half filled with milk, and inflated with air before being
sealed. The skin is then hung with ropes on a tripod of sticks, and rocked
until the movement leads to the formation of butter.
In the Mediterranean_climate, unclarified butter spoils quicklyâ unlike
cheese, it is not a practical method of preserving the nutrients of milk. The
ancient Greeks and Romans seemed to have considered butter a food fit more for
the northern barbarians. A play by the Greek comic poet Anaxandrides refers to
Thracians as boutyrophagoi, "butter-eaters".[17] In his Natural_History, Pliny
the_Elder calls butter "the most delicate of food among barbarous nations", and
goes on to describe its medicinal properties.[18] Later, the physician Galen
also described butter as a medicinal agent only.[19]
Historian and linguist Andrew_Dalby says most references to butter in ancient
Near Eastern texts should more correctly be translated as ghee. Ghee is
mentioned in the Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea as a typical trade article
around the first century CE Arabian_Sea, and Roman geographer Strabo describes
it as a commodity of Arabia and Sudan.[17] In India, ghee has been a symbol of
purity and an offering to the godsâespecially Agni, the Hindu god of
fireâfor more than 3000 years; references to ghee's sacred nature appear
numerous times in the Rigveda, circa 1500â1200 BCE. The tale of the child
Krishna stealing butter remains a popular children's story in India today.
Since India's prehistory, ghee has been both a staple_food and used for
ceremonial purposes, such as fueling holy lamps and funeral pyres.
**** Middle Ages ****
Woman churning butter; Compost et Kalendrier des BergÃ¨res, Paris, 1499
In the cooler climates of northern Europe, people could store butter longer
before it spoiled. Scandinavia has the oldest tradition in Europe of butter
export trade, dating at least to the 12th century.[20] After the fall of Rome
and through much of the Middle_Ages, butter was a common food across most of
Europeâbut had a low reputation, and so was consumed principally by peasants.
Butter slowly became more accepted by the upper class, notably when the early
16th century Roman_Catholic_Church allowed its consumption during Lent. Bread
and butter became common fare among the middle_class, and the English, in
particular, gained a reputation for their liberal use of melted butter as a
sauce with meat and vegetables.[11](p33)
In antiquity, butter was used for fuel in lamps as a substitute for oil. The
Butter Tower of Rouen_Cathedral was erected in the early 16th century when
Archbishop Georges_d'Amboise authorized the burning of butter instead of oil,
which was scarce at the time, during Lent.[21]
Across northern Europe, butter was sometimes treated in a manner unheard-of
today: it was packed into barrels (firkins) and buried in peat_bogs, perhaps
for years. Such "bog_butter" would develop a strong flavor as it aged, but
remain edible, in large part because of the unique cool, airless, antiseptic
and acidic environment of a peat bog. Firkins of such buried butter are a
common archaeological find in Ireland; the National_Museum_of_Ireland_â
Archaeology has some containing "a grayish cheese-like substance, partially
hardened, not much like butter, and quite free from putrefaction." The practice
was most common in Ireland in the 11thâ14th centuries; it ended entirely
before the 19th century.[20]
**** Industrialization ****
Like Ireland, France became well known for its butter, particularly in Normandy
and Brittany. By the 1860s, butter had become so in demand in France that
Emperor Napoleon_III offered prize money for an inexpensive substitute to
supplement France's inadequate butter supplies. A French_chemist claimed the
prize with the invention of margarine in 1869. The first margarine was beef
tallow flavored with milk and worked like butter; vegetable margarine followed
after the development of hydrogenated oils around 1900.
Gustaf de Laval's centrifugal cream separator sped up the butter-making
process.
Until the 19th century, the vast majority of butter was made by hand, on farms.
The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s,
after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the
late 1870s, the centrifugal cream_separator was introduced, marketed most
successfully by Swedish engineer Carl_Gustaf_Patrik_de_Laval.[22] This
dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of
letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was
shipped to the butter factories, and the cream separation took place there.
Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough
to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the
farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half the
butter produced in the United_States was factory made; Europe followed suit
shortly after.
In 1920, Otto_Hunziker authored The Butter Industry, Prepared for Factory,
School and Laboratory,[23] a well-known text in the industry that enjoyed at
least three editions (1920, 1927, 1940). As part of the efforts of the American
Dairy_Science_Association, Professor Hunziker and others published articles
regarding: causes of tallowiness[24] (an odor defect, distinct from rancidity,
a taste defect); mottles[25] (an aesthetic issue related to uneven color);
introduced salts;[26] the impact of creamery metals[27] and liquids;[28] and
acidity measurement.[29] These and other ADSA publications helped standardize
practices internationally.
Butter also provided extra income to farm families. They used wood presses with
carved decoration to press butter into pucks or small bricks to sell at nearby
markets or general stores. The decoration identified the farm that produced the
butter. This practice continued until production was mechanized and butter was
produced in less decorative stick form.[30] Today, butter presses remain in use
for decorative purposes.
Per capita butter consumption declined in most western nations during the 20th
century, in large part because of the rising popularity of margarine, which is
less expensive and, until recent years, was perceived as being healthier. In
the United States, margarine consumption overtook butter during the 1950s,[31]
and it is still the case today that more margarine than butter is eaten in the
U.S. and the EU.[32]
***** Packaging *****
**** United States ****
In the United States, butter has traditionally been made into small,
rectangular blocks by means of a pair of wooden butter paddles. It is usually
produced in 4-ounce (1⁄4 lb; 110 g) sticks that are individually wrapped in
waxed or foiled paper, and sold as a 1 pound (0.45 kg) package of 4 sticks.
This practice is believed to have originated in 1907, when Swift_and_Company
began packaging butter in this manner for mass distribution.[33]
Western-pack shape unsalted butter
Due to historical differences in butter printers (machines that cut and package
butter),[34] 4-ounce sticks are commonly produced in two different shapes:
    * The dominant shape east of the Rocky Mountains is the Elgin, or Eastern-
      pack shape, named for a dairy in Elgin,_Illinois. The sticks measure
      4 3⁄4 by 1 1⁄4 by 1 1⁄4 inches (121 mm Ã 32 mm Ã 32 mm) and are
      typically sold stacked two by two in elongated cube-shaped boxes.[34]
Eastern-pack shape salted butter
    * West of the Rocky Mountains, butter printers standardized on a different
      shape that is now referred to as the Western-pack shape. These butter
      sticks measure 3 1⁄4 by 1 1⁄2 by 1 1⁄2 inches (83 mm Ã 38 mm Ã 38 mm)
      [35] and are usually sold with four sticks packed side-by-side in a flat,
      rectangular box.[34]
Most butter dishes are designed for Elgin-style butter sticks.[34]
Butter stick wrappers are usually marked with divisions for 8 US tablespoons
(120 ml), which is less than their actual volume: the Elgin-pack shape is
8.22 US tbsp, while the Western-pack shape is 8.10 US tbsp. The printing on
unsalted ("sweet") butter wrappers is typically red, while that for salted
butter is typically blue.
**** Elsewhere ****
Outside of the United States, the shape of butter packages is approximately the
same, but the butter is measured for sale and cooking by mass (rather than by
volume or unit/stick), and is sold in 250 g (8.8 oz) and 500 g (18 oz)
packages. The wrapper is usually a foil and waxed-paper laminate. (The waxed
paper is now a siliconised substitute, but is still referred to in some places
as parchment, from the wrapping used in past centuries; and the term
'parchment-wrapped' is still employed where the paper alone is used, without
the foil laminate.)
Butter for commercial and industrial use is packaged in plastic buckets, tubs,
or drums, in quantities and units suited to the local market.
***** Worldwide *****
Butter market, Lhasa, Tibet. 1993
In 1997, India produced 1,470,000 metric tons (1,620,000 short tons) of butter,
most of which was consumed domestically.[36] Second in production was the
United States (522,000 t or 575,000 short tons), followed by France (466,000 t
or 514,000 short tons), Germany (442,000 t or 487,000 short tons), and New
Zealand (307,000 t or 338,000 short tons). France ranks first in per capita
butter consumption with 8 kg per capita per year.[37] In terms of absolute
consumption, Germany was second after India, using 578,000 metric tons (637,000
short tons) of butter in 1997, followed by France (528,000 t or 582,000 short
tons), Russia (514,000 t or 567,000 short tons), and the United States
(505,000 t or 557,000 short tons). New Zealand, Australia, and the Ukraine are
among the few nations that export a significant percentage of the butter they
produce.[38]
Different varieties are found around the world. Smen is a spiced Moroccan
clarified butter, buried in the ground and aged for months or years. A similar
product is maltash of the Hunza_Valley, where cow and yak butter can be buried
for decades, and is used at events such as weddings.[39] Yak_butter is a
specialty in Tibet; tsampa, barley flour mixed with yak butter, is a staple
food. Butter_tea is consumed in the Himalayan regions of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal
and India. It consists of tea served with intensely flavoredâor
"rancid"âyak butter and salt. In African and Asian developing_nations, butter
is traditionally made from sour_milk rather than cream. It can take several
hours of churning to produce workable butter grains from fermented milk.[40]
***** Storage and cooking *****
Hollandaise_sauce served over white asparagus and potatoes.
Normal butter softens to a spreadable consistency around 15 Â°C (60 Â°F), well
above refrigerator temperatures. The "butter compartment" found in many
refrigerators may be one of the warmer sections inside, but it still leaves
butter quite hard. Until recently, many refrigerators sold in New_Zealand
featured a "butter conditioner", a compartment kept warmer than the rest of the
refrigeratorâbut still cooler than room temperatureâwith a small heater.
[41] Keeping butter tightly wrapped delays rancidity, which is hastened by
exposure to light or air, and also helps prevent it from picking up other
odors. Wrapped butter has a shelf_life of several months at refrigerator
temperatures.[42] Butter can also be frozen to further extend its storage life.
"French_butter_dishes" or "Acadian butter dishes" have a lid with a long
interior lip, which sits in a container holding a small amount of water.
Usually the dish holds just enough water to submerge the interior lip when the
dish is closed. Butter is packed into the lid. The water acts as a seal to keep
the butter fresh, and also keeps the butter from overheating in hot
temperatures. This method lets butter sit on a countertop for several days
without spoiling.
Once butter is softened, spices, herbs, or other flavoring agents can be mixed
into it, producing what is called a compound butter or composite butter
(sometimes also called composed butter). Compound butters can be used as
spreads, or cooled, sliced, and placed onto hot food to melt into a sauce.
Sweetened compound butters can be served with desserts; such hard_sauces are
often flavored with spirits.
When heated, butter quickly melts into a thin liquid.
Melted butter plays an important role in the preparation of sauces, most
obviously in French_cuisine. Beurre_noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre_noir
(black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and
sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an
addition of vinegar or lemon_juice.[11](p36) Hollandaise and bÃ©arnaise sauces
are emulsions of egg_yolk and melted butter; they are in essence mayonnaises
made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and bÃ©arnaise sauces are
stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself
contains enough emulsifiersâmostly remnants of the fat globule membranesâto
form a stable emulsion on its own.[11](p635â636) Beurre_blanc (white butter)
is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion
with the texture of thick cream. Beurre_montÃ© (prepared butter) is melted but
still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of "mounting" a
sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end
of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shineâas well as a
buttery taste.[11](p632)
In Poland, the butter_lamb (Baranek wielkanocny) is a traditional addition to
the Easter Meal for many Polish Catholics. Butter is shaped into a lamb either
by hand or in a lamb-shaped mould. Butter is also used to make edible
decorations to garnish other dishes.
Mixing melted butter with chocolate to make a brownie.
Butter is used for sautÃ©ing and frying, although its milk solids brown and
burn above 150 Â°C (250 Â°F)âa rather low temperature for most applications.
The smoke_point of butterfat is around 200 Â°C (400 Â°F), so clarified butter
or ghee is better suited to frying.[11](p37) Ghee has always been a common
frying medium in India, where many avoid other animal fats for cultural or
religious reasons.
Butter fills several roles in baking, where it is used in a similar manner as
other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may
better complement sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters
are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which
introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the
butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies
like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the
butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough,
which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking,
the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is
a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to
work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often
chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.
***** Nutritional information *****
As butter is essentially just the milk fat, it contains only traces of lactose,
so moderate consumption of butter is not a problem for lactose_intolerant
people.[43] People with milk_allergies may still need to avoid butter, which
contains enough of the allergy-causing proteins to cause reactions.[44] Whole
milk, butter and cream have high levels of saturated_fat.[45][46] Butter is a
good source of Vitamin_A.
