Dairy product
This article is about the dairy product. For the English rock band, see Cream_
(band). For other uses, see Cream_(disambiguation).
For a dessert similar to blancmange, called Table cream, see Pudding_Ã‚Â§Â Creamy
puddings.

of the milk.
Cream is a dairy_product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from
the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which
is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of
cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators". In
many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat
content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and
contains high levels of saturated_fat.[1][2]
Cream skimmed from milk may be called "sweet cream" to distinguish it from
cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower
fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and "cheesy".[3] In many countries,
cream is usually sold partially fermented: sour_cream, crÃƒÂ¨me_fraÃƒÂ®che, and so
on. Both forms have many culinary uses in sweet, bitter, salty and tangy
dishes.
Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey_cattle) grazing on natural
pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants
they eat; this gives it a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the
yellowish-white color: cream. This is also the origin of butter's yellow color.
Cream from goat's milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based
pellets, is white.

***** Cuisine[edit] *****

Cream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including ice_cream, many sauces,
soups, stews, puddings, and some custard bases, and is also used for cakes.
Whipped_cream is served as a topping on ice cream sundaes, milkshakes, lassi,
eggnog, sweet pies, strawberries, blueberries or peaches. Irish_cream is an
alcoholic liqueur which blends cream with whiskey, and often honey, wine, or
coffee. Cream is also used in Indian curries such as masala dishes.
Cream (usually light/single cream or half_and_half) is often added to coffee in
the US and Canada.
Both single and double cream can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat
crÃƒÂ¨me fraÃƒÂ®che are often used when cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent
any problem with it separating or "splitting". Double cream can be thinned with
milk to make an approximation of single cream.
The French word crÃƒÂ¨me denotes not only dairy cream, but also other thick
liquids such as sweet and savory custards, which are normally made with milk,
not cream.[4]
***** Types[edit] *****
Stewed nectarines and heavy cream
Different grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they
have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on. In many jurisdictions, there are
regulations for each type.
**** Australia and New Zealand[edit] ****
The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code Ã¢Â€Â“ Standard 2.5.2 Ã¢Â€Â“ Defines
cream as a milk product comparatively rich in fat, in the form of an emulsion
of fat-in-skim milk, which can be obtained by separation from milk. Cream must
contain no less than 350 g/kg (35%) milk fat.[5]
Manufacturers labels may distinguish between different fat contents, a general
guideline is as follows:
 _____________________________________________________________________________
|Name___________________|Fat_Content|Main_Uses________________________________|

**** Canada[edit] ****
Canadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States,
except for "light cream", which is very low-fat cream, usually with 5 or 6
percent butterfat.[7] Specific product characteristics are generally uniform
throughout Canada, but names vary by both geographic and linguistic area and by
manufacturer: "coffee cream" may be 10 or 18 percent cream and "half-and-half"
("crÃƒÂ¨me lÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ¨re") may be 3, 5, 6 or 10 percent, all depending on location and
brand.[8][9]
Regulations allow cream to contain acidity_regulators and stabilizers. For
whipping cream, allowed additives include skim milk powder (Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 0.25%), glucose
solids (Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 0.1%), calcium sulphate (Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 0.005%), and xanthan gum (Ã¢Â‰Â¤ 0.02%).
[10] The content of milk fat in canned cream must be displayed as a percentage
followed by "milk fat", "B.F", or "M.F".[11]

**** France[edit] ****
In France, the use of the term "cream" for food products is defined by the
decree 80-313 of April 23, 1980.[12] It specifies the minimum rate of milk fat
(12%) as well as the rules for pasteurisation or UHT_sterilisation. The mention
"crÃƒÂ¨me fraÃƒÂ®che" (fresh cream) can only be used for pasteurised creams
conditioned on production site within 24h after pasteurisation. Even if food
additives complying with French and European laws are allowed, usually, none
will be found in plain "crÃƒÂ¨mes" and "crÃƒÂ¨mes fraÃƒÂ®ches" apart from lactic
ferments (some low cost creams (or close to creams) can contain thickening
agents, but rarely).[citation_needed] Fat content is commonly shown as "XX%
M.G." ("matiÃƒÂ¨re grasse").

In Japan, cream sold in supermarkets is usually between 35% and 48% butterfat.
**** Russia[edit] ****
Russia, as well as other EAC_countries, legally separates cream into two
classes: normal (10Ã¢Â€Â“34% butterfat) and heavy (35Ã¢Â€Â“58%),[13] but the industry
has pretty much standardized around the following types:

In Sweden, cream is usually sold as:
    * MatlagningsgrÃƒÂ¤dde ("cooking cream"), 10Ã¢Â€Â“15Â %
    * KaffegrÃƒÂ¤dde ("Coffee cream"), 10-12Â %, earlier mostly 12Â %
    * VispgrÃƒÂ¤dde (whipping cream), 36Ã¢Â€Â“40Â %, the 36Â % variant often has
      additives.
MellangrÃƒÂ¤dde (27%) is, nowadays, a less common variant. GrÃƒÂ¤ddfil (usually
12Â %) and Creme Fraiche (usually around 35Â %) are two common sour cream
products.
**** Switzerland[edit] ****
In Switzerland, the types of cream are legally defined[16] as follows:

Most cream products sold in the United States at retail contain the minimum
permissible fat content for their product type, e.g., "Half and half" almost
always contains only 10.5% butterfat.[21]
Not all grades are defined by all jurisdictions, and the exact fat content
ranges vary. The above figures, except for "manufacturer's cream", are based on
the Code_of_Federal_Regulations, Title 21, Part 131[22][23]
***** Processing and additives[edit] *****
Cream may have thickening_agents and stabilizers added. Thickeners include
sodium_alginate, carrageenan, gelatine, sodium_bicarbonate, tetrasodium
pyrophosphate, and alginic_acid.[24]:296[25]
Other processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to
produce oily globules (called "feathering") when added to coffee. The stability
of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which
can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of sodium_caseinate,
although this is expensive.[24]:297
***** Other cream products[edit] *****
Chart of 50 types of milk products and relationships, including cream (click on
image to enlarge).
Butter is made by churning cream to separate the butterfat and buttermilk. This
can be done by hand or by machine.
Whipped_cream is made by whisking or mixing air into cream with more than 30%
fat, to turn the liquid cream into a soft solid. Nitrous_oxide, from whipped-
cream_chargers may also be used to make whipped cream.
Sour_cream, common in many countries including the U.S., Canada and Australia,
is cream (12 to 16% or more milk fat) that has been subjected to a bacterial
culture that produces lactic_acid (0.5%+), which sours and thickens it.
CrÃƒÂ¨me_fraÃƒÂ®che (28% milk fat) is slightly soured with bacterial culture, but
not as sour or as thick as sour cream. Mexican crema (or cream espesa) is
similar to crÃƒÂ¨me fraÃƒÂ®che.
Smetana is a heavy cream derived (15Ã¢Â€Â“40% milk fat) Central and Eastern
European sweet or sour cream.
Rjome or rÃƒÂ¸mme is Norwegian sour cream containing 35% milk fat, similar to
Icelandic sÃƒÂ½rÃƒÂ°ur rjÃƒÂ³mi.
Clotted_cream, common in the United Kingdom, is made through a process that
starts by slowly heating whole milk to produce a very high-fat (55%) product.
This is similar to Indian malai.
Reduced_cream is a cream product used in New Zealand to make Kiwi dip.
***** Other items called "cream"[edit] *****
Some non-edible substances are called creams due to their consistency: shoe
cream is runny, unlike regular waxy shoe polish; hand/body 'creme' or "skin
cream" is meant for moisturizing the skin.
Regulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word cream for foods.
Words such as creme, kreme, creame, or whipped topping (e.g., Cool_Whip) are
often used for products which cannot legally be called cream, though in some
jurisdictions even these spellings may be disallowed, for example under the
doctrine of idem_sonans.[26][27] Oreo and Hydrox cookies are a type of sandwich
cookie in which two biscuits have a soft, sweet filling between them that is
called "crÃƒÂ¨me filling." In some cases, foods can be described as cream
although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example in Britain
"ice_cream" does not have to be a dairy product (although it must be labelled
"contains non-milk fat"), and salad_cream is the customary name for a condiment
that has been produced since the 1920s.[28]
In other languages, cognates of "cream" are also sometimes used for non-food
products, such as fogkrÃƒÂ©m (Hungarian for toothpaste), or Sonnencreme (German
for suntan lotion).
