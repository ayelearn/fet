Ketchup, also known as catsup, ketsup, red sauce, and tomato sauce, is a sauce
used as a condiment. Originally, recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters,
mussels, or walnuts, among other ingredients,[1][2] but now the unmodified term
usually refers to tomato ketchup.
Ketchup is a sweet and tangy sauce now typically made from tomatoes, sugar, and
vinegar, with assorted seasonings and spices. The specific spices and flavors
vary, but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic,
and mustard; and sometimes include celery, cinnamon or ginger.[3]
The market leader in the United States (60% market share) and United_Kingdom
(82%) is Heinz.[4][5] Hunt's has the second biggest share of the US market with
less than 20%. In much of the UK, Australia and New Zealand ketchup is also
known as "tomato sauce" (a term that means a fresher pasta_sauce elsewhere in
the world) or "red sauce" (especially in Wales).
Tomato ketchup is most often used as a condiment to dishes that are usually
served hot and may be fried or greasy: french_fries, hamburgers, hot_dogs,
chicken_tenders, tater_tots, hot_sandwiches, meat_pies, cooked eggs, and
grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one
ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavor may be replicated as
an additive_flavoring for snacks such as potato_chips.

***** History *****
**** Pickled fish and spices ****
In the 17th century, the Chinese mixed a concoction of pickled fish and spices
and called it (in the Amoy_dialect) kÃ´e-chiap or kÃª-chiap (é®­æ±, Mandarin
Chinese guÄ« zhÄ«, Cantonese gwai1 zap1) meaning the brine of pickled_fish
(é®­, salmon; æ±, juice) or shellfish.[6][7] By the early 18th century, the
table sauce had arrived in the Malay states (present day Malaysia and
Singapore), where English colonists first tasted it. The Malaysian-Malay word
for the sauce was kicap or kecap (pronounced "kay-chap"). That word evolved
into the English word "ketchup".[8] English settlers took ketchup with them to
the American colonies.[1]
The term Catchup was used in 1690 in the Dictionary_of_the_Canting_Crew[9]
which was well acclaimed in North America.[10] The spelling "catchup" may have
also been used in the past.[11]
**** Mushroom ketchup ****
Main article: Mushroom_ketchup
Homemade mushroom_ketchup in a plastic tub
In the United Kingdom, preparations of ketchup were historically and originally
prepared with mushrooms as a primary ingredient, rather than tomatoes.[12][13]
[14] Ketchup recipes began to appear in British and then American cookbooks in
the 18th century. In a 1742 London cookbook, the fish sauce had already taken
on a very British flavor, with the addition of shallots and mushrooms. The
mushrooms soon became the main ingredient, and from 1750 to 1850 the word
"ketchup" began to mean any number of thin dark sauces made of mushrooms or
even walnuts.[15] In the United States, mushroom_ketchup dates back to at least
1770, and was prepared by British colonists in "English speaking colonies in
North America".[16] In contemporary times, mushroom ketchup is available in the
UK, although it is not a commonly used condiment.[17]
**** Tomato ketchup ****
Tomato ketchup and other condiments
Tomato ketchup next to raw tomatoes
Many variations of ketchup were created, but the tomato-based version did not
appear until about a century later after other types. An early recipe for
"Tomata Catsup" from 1817 still has the anchovies that betray its fish-sauce
ancestry:[15]
        1. Gather a gallon of fine, red, and full ripe tomatas; mash them
           with one pound of salt.
        2. Let them rest for three days, press off the juice, and to each
           quart add a quarter of a pound of anchovies, two ounces of
           shallots, and an ounce of ground black pepper.
        3. Boil up together for half an hour, strain through a sieve, and
           put to it the following spices; a quarter of an ounce of mace,
           the same of allspice and ginger, half an ounce of nutmeg, a
           drachm of coriander seed, and half a drachm of cochineal.
        4. Pound all together; let them simmer gently for twenty minutes,
           and strain through a bag: when cold, bottle it, adding to each
           bottle a wineglass of brandy. It will keep for seven years.
By the mid-1850s, the anchovies had been dropped.[15]
James_Mease published another recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using
tomatoes appeared in The Virginia Housewife (an influential 19th-century
cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas_Jefferson's cousin). American cooks
also began to sweeten ketchup in the 19th century.[18]
As the century progressed, tomato ketchup began its ascent in popularity in the
United States. Ketchup was popular long before fresh tomatoes were.[19] People
were less hesitant to eat tomatoes as part of a highly processed product that
had been cooked and infused with vinegar and spices.[19]
Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. Jonas Yerkes is credited as the
first American to sell tomato ketchup in a bottle.[20] By 1837, he had produced
and distributed the condiment nationally.[21] Shortly thereafter, other
companies followed suit. F._&_J._Heinz launched their tomato ketchup in 1876.
[22] Heinz_tomato_ketchup was advertised: "Blessed relief for Mother and the
other women in the household!", a slogan which alluded to the lengthy and
onerous process required to produce tomato ketchup in the home.[23] With
industrial ketchup production and a need for better preservation there was a
great increase of sugar in ketchup, leading to our modern sweet and sour
formula.[15] In Australia, it wasn't until the late 19th century that sugar was
added to tomato sauce, initially in small quantities, but today contains just
as much as American ketchup and only differed in the proportions of tomatoes,
salt and vinegar in early recipes.[24]
The Webster's_Dictionary of 1913 defined "catchup" as: "table sauce made from
mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. [Also written as ketchup]."
Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century, out of a debate
over the use of sodium_benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey_W.
Wiley, the "father" of the Food_and_Drug_Administration in the US, challenged
the safety of benzoate which was banned in the 1906 Pure_Food_and_Drug_Act. In
response, entrepreneurs including Henry_J._Heinz, pursued an alternative recipe
that eliminated the need for that preservative.[3] Katherine_Bitting, a
microbotanist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, carried out
research that proved in 1909 that increasing the sugar and vinegar content of
the product would prevent spoilage without use of artificial preservatives. She
was assisted by her husband, Arvil Bitting, an official at that agency.[25]
Prior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that
time were watery and thin, in part due to the use of unripe tomatoes, which
were low in pectin.[26] They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling
ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or
degradation in flavor. But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate
benzoate also produced changes[clarification_needed] that some experts (such as
Andrew F. Smith[27]) believe were key to the establishment of tomato ketchup as
the dominant American condiment.
**** Later innovations ****
In fast food outlets, ketchup is often dispensed in small sachets or tubs.
Diners tear the side or top and squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup_packets,
or peel the foil lid off the tub for dipping. In 2011, Heinz began offering a
new measured-portion package, called the "Dip and Squeeze" packet, which can be
opened in either way, giving both options.[28]
Some fast food outlets previously dispensed ketchup from hand-operated pumps
into paper cups. This method has made a comeback in the first decade of the
21st century, as cost and environmental concerns over the increasing use of
individual plastic ketchup tubs were taken into account.
In October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt,
which eventually included green (2000), purple (2001), mystery (pink, orange,
or teal, 2002), and blue (2003).[29] These products were made by adding food
coloring to the traditional ketchup. As of January 2006[update] these products
were discontinued.[30]
***** Terminology *****
The term used for the sauce varies. Ketchup is the dominant term in American
English, and Canadian_English, although catsup is commonly used in some
southern US states and Mexico.[31]
Tomato sauce is more common in English-speaking countries outside North
America, including Australia and New Zealand.[32] However, in Canada and the
United States, tomato_sauce is not a synonym for ketchup but a sauce made from
tomato_paste and commonly eaten with pasta.
Red sauce is the term used in Welsh_English, Scottish_English and some parts of
England, such as the Black_Country, and in South_London, contrasting with brown
sauce. In Canadian and American English, "red sauce" refers to various tomato-
based sauces commonly paired with pasta dishes, and is not a synonym for
ketchup.[citation_needed]
***** Etymology *****
The etymology of the word ketchup is unclear, with multiple competing theories.
[33]
**** Chinese theory ****
One theory is that the word came to English from the Cantonese "keh jap"
(èæ± ke2 zap1, the word literally means "tomato sauce; tomato juice" in
Cantonese).[34] However, this is likely a folk_etymology, as it cannot account
for historical terms like "mushroom ketchup" and "walnut ketchup".
An alternative theory is that the word derives from one of two words from the
Fujian region of coastal southern China: "kÃ´e-chiap" (in Xiamen (Amoy)) or
"kÃª-chiap"[7][35] (in Guangzhou (Canton)). Both of these words (é®­æ±, kÃ´e-
chiap and kÃªchiap) come from the Amoy_dialect of China, where it meant the
brine of pickled fish (é®­, salmon; æ±, juice) or shellfish.[6] There are
citations of "koe-chiap" in the Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language
of the Amoy (London; Trudner) from 1873, defined as "brine of pickled fish or
shell-fish".
**** Malay theory ****
Ketchup may have[8] entered the English language from the Malay word kicap
(pron. "kichap", sometimes spelled kecap or ketjap). Originally meaning "fish
sauce", the word itself derives from the Chinese terms[36] above.
In Indonesian_cuisine, which is similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to
fermented savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap
asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and
kecap manis or "sweet kecap" in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce
that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger,
anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over medium heat until rather syrupy. A
third type, kecap ikan, meaning "fish kecap" is fish_sauce similar to the Thai
nam_pla or the Philippine patis. It is not, however, soy-based.
**** European-Arabic theory ****
American anthropologist E.N. Anderson relies on Elizabeth David to claim that
ketchup is a cognate of the French escaveche, meaning "food in sauce", but
gives no further authority.[37] The word also exists in Spanish and Portuguese
forms as escabeche, "a sauce for pickling", which culinary historian Karen Hess
traced back to Arabic Kabees, or "pickling with vinegar". The term was
anglicized to caveach, a word first attested in the late 17th century, at the
same time as ketchup.[33]

The word entered the English_language in Britain during the late 17th century,
appearing in print as catchup (1690) and later as ketchup (1711). The following

***** Composition *****
Heinz tomato ketchup's ingredients are: tomato concentrate from red ripe
tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high_fructose_corn_syrup, corn_syrup, salt, spice,
onion powder, and natural flavoring.[39] Tomato concentrate from red ripe
tomatoes is the first ingredient on the list, which means it has the highest
percentage of weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex
composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino
acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles.[40] The
second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure
water and twenty percent acetic acid.[41] Next is high fructose corn syrup, the
sugars of which are made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other
polysaccharides and sugars.[42] The next ingredient is corn syrup, the sugar of
which is 100% glucose.[42] Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed
of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring are the
last ingredients on the list, meaning that they have the least percent weight.
These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.
**** "Fancy" ketchup ****
Some ketchup in the U.S. is labeled "Fancy". This is a USDA grade, relating to
specific_gravity. Fancy ketchup has a higher tomato solid concentration than
other USDA grades.[43]
            USDA ketchup grades
Grade          Specific gravity Total solids
Fancy          1.15             33%
Extra Standard 1.13             29%
Standard       1.11             25%

Fresh tomatoes received at a tomato processing plant can be turned into a
variety of different products, one of which includes ketchup. The process
begins by washing the tomatoes to remove any outer dirt and foreign matter from
the skin before processing. Upon inspection, damaged, spoiled or unwanted
tomatoes will be sorted out manually. Tomatoes will usually be conveyed by
water throughout the preliminary stages to avoid bruising.
After being sorted, washed and chopped up, they proceed into large steel vats
for preservation/precooking and also to destroy any bacteria that could be
harmful to the rest of the processing period as well as for the consumer after
production. The juice will be extracted out by a juice extraction system. The
outer skin, seed, stem, and fiber of fruits would be separated from the liquid
in a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the
tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency
is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.
Ketchup processing includes adding additional ingredients, cooking, more
screening and filtering, air-removal, packaging and cooling.
After juice filtration, additional ingredients are added to the mixture to
achieve the desired taste and consistency. Some of the main ingredients used to
create ketchup include sweeteners, vinegar, salt and spices, and flavouring.
These additions are usually integrated later on in the process except for some
spices added in at the beginning. Throughout the entire process, the
temperature must be consistently monitored to make sure all the ingredients are
being added and appropriately absorbed. Air is then removed to prevent
oxidation, maintain proper colouring and inhibit the growth of any unwanted
bacteria. Before being packaged, the ketchup is heated to approx.190 Â°F
(88 Â°C) to prevent contamination.
After packaging, the bottles are immediately sealed to retain the freshness and
preserve the shelf-life of the product. The final step is cooling the product
via cold air or water to maintain its flavour.
Different manufacturers will label their products accordingly with all the
necessary nutritional and other legal information as required.

***** Viscosity *****
Transferring ketchup between plastic bottles.
Commercial tomato ketchup has an additive, usually xanthan_gum, which gives the
condiment a pseudoplastic or "shear thinning" property - more commonly known as
thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a
relatively small amount addedâusually 0.5%âwhich can make it difficult to
pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures
that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity
enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the
bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with
the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique
involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two
fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz_ketchup
glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow
by applying the correct shearing force.[45] These techniques work because of
how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases
with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or
tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the
ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.
Ketchup is a non-Newtonian_fluid meaning that its viscosity changes under
stress and is not constant. It is a shear thinning fluid which means its
viscosity decreases with increased shear stress.[46] The equation used to
designate a Non-Newtonian fluid is as follows:     &#x03B7; = &#x03C4;  /     y
&#x02D9;      {\displaystyle \eta =\tau /{\dot {y}}}  [{\displaystyle \eta
=\tau /{\dot {y}}}]. This equation represents apparent_viscosity where apparent
viscosity is the shear_stress divided by shear_rate. Viscosity is dependent on
stress. This is apparent when you shake a bottle of tomato sauce/ketchup so it
becomes liquid enough to squirt out. Its viscosity decreased with stress.[47]
Graph representation of the three main fluid viscosity categories
The molecular composition of ketchup is what creates ketchup's pseudoplastic
characteristics. Small polysaccharides, sugars, acids, and water make up the
majority of the metastable ketchup product, and these small structures are able
to move more easily throughout a matrix because of their low mass. While
exposed to shear stress, the molecules within the suspension are able to
respond quickly and create an alignment within the product.[48] The bonds
between the molecules are mostly hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and
electrostatic interactions, all of which can be broken when subject to stress.
Hydrogen_bonds are constantly rearranging within a product due to their need to
be in the lowest energy state, which further confirms that the bonds between
the molecules will be easily disrupted. This alignment only lasts for as long
as shear stress is applied. The molecules return to their original disorganized
state once the shear stress dissipates.[48]
In 2017, researchers at the Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology reported the
development of a bottle coating that allowed all the product to slip out
without leaving a residue.[49]
***** Separation *****
Ketchup is one of the many products that is leachable; meaning that the water
within the product migrates together as the larger molecules within the product
sediment, ultimately causing water to separate out. This forms a layer of water
on top of the ketchup due to the molecular instability within the product.[41]
This instability is caused by interactions between hydrophobic molecules and
charged molecules within the ketchup suspension.
Pectin is a polysaccharide within tomatoes that has the ability to bind to
itself and to other molecules, especially water, around it. This enables it to
create a gel-like matrix, dependent on the amount within the solution. Water is
a large part of ketchup, due to it being 80% of the composition of distilled
vinegar. In order for the water within the ketchup to be at the lowest possible
energy state, all of the hydrogen bonds that are able to be made within the
matrix must be made.[50] The water bound to the polysaccharide moves more
slowly within the matrix, which is unfavorable with respect to entropy.[41] The
increased order within the polysaccharide-water complex gives rise to a high-
energy state, in which the water will want to be relieved. This concept implies
that water will more favorably bind with itself because of the increased
disorder between water molecules. This is partially the cause for water
leaching out of solution when left undisturbed for a short period of time.
Other interactions that induce leaching are electrostatic and ionic
interactions. Electrostatic interactions occur between charged molecules, which
have repulsive or attractive forces between each other. The pectin within
ketchup will have negative and neutral charges along the molecule due to the
hydroxyl groups and relative pH, which is 3.9 on average.[51] Pectin is most
stable at a pH of 3.5, so the more basic pH within ketchup will protonate the
hydroxyl side chains and therefore create a less viscous gel. Acetic_acid
within vinegar also has hydroxyl groups that will have a dispersed amount of
negative and neutral charges along each molecule. The acetic acid and pectin
will display repulsive interactions between the negatively charged oxygens on
each molecule. The hydroxyls on each molecule will be able to form hydrogen
bonds with the water in the product. The addition of salt will reduce the
repulsive interactions between the negatively charged side chains of acetic
acid and pectin within solution because they will create bonds with the
dissociated sodium and chloride ions.[52] The hydrogen bonds and electrostatic
interactions will encourage leaching because the formation of bonds associated
with the need for molecules to be in the lowest energy state are not always
bonds that happen between different molecules and instead are formed between
like molecules, causing aggregation.
A way for ketchup manufacturing companies to avoid leaching of their products
would be to add a hydrocolloid. Xanthan_gum is able to stabilize ketchup by
covalently binding to water. This strong bond keeps water from separating out
of the ketchup and creating a layer at the surface.[41]
