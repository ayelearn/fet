****** Hurdle technology ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Hurdle technology is a method of ensuring that pathogens in food_products can
be eliminated or controlled. This means the food products will be safe for
consumption, and their shelf_life will be extended. Hurdle technology usually
works by combining more than one approach. These approaches can be thought of
as "hurdles" the pathogen has to overcome if it is to remain active in the
food. The right combination of hurdles can ensure all pathogens are eliminated
or rendered harmless in the final product.[1]
Hurdle technology has been defined by Leistner (2000) as an intelligent
combination of hurdles which secures the microbial safety and stability as well
as the organoleptic and nutritional quality and the economic viability of food
products.[2] The organoleptic quality of the food refers to its sensory
properties, that is its look, taste, smell and texture.
Examples of hurdles in a food system are high temperature during processing,
low temperature during storage, increasing the acidity, lowering the water
activity or redox_potential, or the presence of preservatives. According to the
type of pathogens and how risky they are, the intensity of the hurdles can be
adjusted individually to meet consumer preferences in an economical way,
without compromising the safety of the product.[1]

***** Hurdles[edit] *****
Each hurdle aims to eliminate, inactivate or at least inhibit unwanted
microorganisms. Common salt or organic_acids can be used as hurdles to control
microbials in food. Many natural antimicrobials such as nisin, natamycin and
other bacteriocins, and essential oils derived from rosemary or thyme, also
work well.
Principal hurdles used for food preservation (after Leistner, 1995)[3][4]
Parameter               Symbol Application
High temperature        F      Heating
Low temperature         T      Chilling, freezing
Reduced water_activity  aw     Drying, curing, conserving
Increased acidity       pH     Acid addition or formation
Reduced redox_potential Eh     Removal of oxygen or addition of ascorbate
Biopreservatives               Competitive flora such as microbial fermentation
Other preservatives            Sorbates, sulfites, nitrites
"Traditionally, fermented seafood products common in Japan, provide a typical
example of hurdle technology. Fermentation of sushi employs hurdles that favour
growth of desirable bacteria but inhibit the growth of pathogens. The important
hurdles in the early stages of fermentation are salt and vinegar. Raw fish is
cured in salt (20â30%, w/w) for one month before being desalted and pickled
in vinegar. The main target of these hurdles is C._botulinum. Growth of lactic
acid_bacteria during fermentation results in acid production from metabolism of
added sugars and rice. The result is a pH hurdle important in controlling
growth of C. botulinum."[1]
Types of hurdles used for food preservation (from Ohlsson and Bengtsson, 2002)
[4][5]
Type of hurdle  Examples
                Aseptic packaging, electromagnetic energy (microwave, radio
                frequency, pulsed magnetic fields, high electric fields), high
                temperatures (blanching, pasteurization, sterilization,
Physical        evaporation, extrusion, baking, frying), ionizing_radiation,
                low temperature (chilling, freezing), modified_atmospheres,
                packaging films (including active_packaging, edible coatings),
                photodynamic inactivation, ultra-high_pressures,
                ultrasonication, ultraviolet radiation
                Carbon dioxide, ethanol, lactic_acid, lactoperoxidase, low pH,
                low redox_potential, low water_activity, Maillard_reaction
Physicochemical products, organic acids, oxygen, ozone, phenols, phosphates,
                salt, smoking, sodium nitrite/nitrate, sodium or potassium
                sulphite, spices and herbs, surface_treatment agents
Microbial       Antibiotics, bacteriocins, competitive flora, protective
                cultures
***** Synergistic effects[edit] *****
There can be significant synergistic effects between hurdles. For example,
Gram-positive_bacteria include some of the more important spoilage bacteria,
such as Clostridium, Bacillus and Listeria. A synergistic enhancement occurs if
nisin is used against these bacteria in combination with antioxidants, organic
acids or other antimicrobials. Combining antimicrobial hurdles in an
intelligent way means other hurdles can be reduced, yet the resulting food can
have superior sensory qualities.
