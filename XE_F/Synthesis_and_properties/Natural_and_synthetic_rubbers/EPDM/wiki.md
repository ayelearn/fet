Idealized EPDM polymer, red = ethylene-derived, blue = propylene-derived, black
= ethylidene norbornene-derived.
EPDM rubber (ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber),[1][2][3] is a type of
synthetic_rubber, which can be used in a wide range of applications. This is an
M-Class rubber where the 'M' in M-Class refers to its classification in ASTM
standard D-1418; the M class comprises elastomers having a saturated chain of
the polyethylene type (the M deriving from the more correct term
polymethylene). EPDM is made from ethylene, propylene and a diene comonomer
that enables crosslinking via sulphur vulcanisation systems. The earlier
relative of EPDM is EPR, ethylene-propylene rubber, that contains no diene
units and can only be crosslinked using radical methods such as peroxides.[4]
Dienes used in the manufacture of EPDM rubbers are ethylidene_norbornene (ENB),
dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), and vinyl norbornene (VNB).
EPDM is related to polyethylene, into which high amounts, from 45% to 85% by
weight, of propylene have been copolymerised to reduce the formation of the
typical polyethylene crystallinity. EPDM is a semi-crystalline material with
ethylene-type crystal structures at higher ethylene contents, becoming
essentially amorphous at ethylene contents that approach 50 wt%.
Rubbers with saturated polymer backbones, such as EPDM, have much better
resistance to heat, light and ozone compared to unsaturated rubbers such as
natural_rubber, SBR or polychloroprene (Neoprene). As such, EPDM can be
formulated to be resistant to temperatures as high as 150Â°C, and, properly
formulated, can be used outside for many years or decades without degradation.
EPDM has good low temperature properties, with elastic properties to
temperatures as low as -40Â°C depending on the grade and the formulation.

As with most rubbers, EPDM is always used compounded with fillers such as
carbon_black and calcium carbonate, with plasticisers such as paraffinic oils,
and has useful rubbery properties only when crosslinked. Crosslinking mostly
takes place via vulcanisation with sulphur, but is also accomplished with
peroxides (for better heat resistance) or with phenolic resins. High energy
radiation such as from electron_beams is sometimes used for producing foams and
wire and cable.
***** Properties[5][edit] *****
EPDM is compatible with polar_substances, e.g. fireproof hydraulic_fluids,
ketones, hot and cold water, and alkalis. It is incompatible with most
hydrocarbons, such as oils, kerosene, aromatic, gasoline, as well as
halogenated_solvents. EPDM exhibits outstanding resistance to heat, ozone,
steam and weather. It is an electrical insulator.
Typical properties of EPDM vulcanizates are given below. EPDM can be compounded
to meet specific properties to a limit, depending first on the EPDM polymers
available, then the processing and curing method(s) employed. EPDMs are
available in a range of molecular weights (indicated in terms of Mooney
viscosity ML(1+4) at 125 Â°C), varying levels of ethylene, third monomer, and
oil content.

***** Uses[edit] *****
An EPDM rubber roof
A common use is in vehicles: door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and
sometimes hood seals.[8] Frequently, these seals are the source of noise due to
movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between
the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This
synthetic rubber membrane has also been used for flat roofs because of its
durability and low maintenance costs.[9]
This noise can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the
time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also improve the
chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a
light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce
noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water
pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators,
and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing
on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler
(intercooler) to the intake manifold. EPDM is also used for elastic hanger
elements to attach exhaust systems to the underfloor of vehicles.
EPDM rubber is used in seals (for example, it is used in cold-room doors since
it is an insulator, as well as in the face seals of industrial respirators in
automotive paint spray environments. EPDM is also used in glass-run_channels,
radiators, garden, and appliance hose, tubing, pond_liners, washers, belts,
electrical_insulation, vibrators, O-rings, solar_panel heat collectors, and
speaker cone surrounds.
It is also used as a medium for water resistance in electrical cable-jointing,
roofing_membranes (since it does not pollute the run-off rainwater, which is of
vital importance for rainwater_harvesting), geomembranes, rubber mechanical
goods, plastic impact modification, thermoplastic, vulcanizates, and many other
applications.[10][11] Colored EPDM granules are mixed with polyurethane binders
and troweled or sprayed onto concrete, asphalt, screenings, interlocking brick,
wood, etc. to create a non-slip, soft, porous safety surface for wet-deck areas
such as pool decks and as safety surfacing under playground play equipment
(designed to help lessen fall injury).
