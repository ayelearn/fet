Pultrusion is a continuous process for manufacture of composite_materials with
constant cross-section. The term is a portmanteau word, combining "pull" and
"extrusion". As opposed to extrusion, which pushes the material, pultrusion
works by pulling the material.

***** History[edit] *****
A very early pultrusions type patent was filed by J.H. Watson in 1944. This was
followed by M.J. Meekâs filing of 1950. The first commercial pultrusions were
provided by Glastic Company of Cleveland, Ohio under the patent filed in 1952
by Rodger B. White. The patent issued to W. B. Goldsworthy in 1959 helped
initiate the promotion and knowledge spread within the industry. W._Brandt
Goldsworthy is widely regarded as the inventor of pultrusion.[1]
Parallel to the work of Goldsworthy, who concentrated his work on unsaturated
polyester resins, Ernst KÃ¼hne in Germany developed a quite similar process in
1954 based on epoxy resin.
Invention, development and the issuance of patents continue in the pultrusion
field through today. A later innovation in this field has been developed and
patented by Thomas GmbH + Co. Technik + Innovation KG in Germany 2008 and is
described below.
***** Process[edit] *****
Diagram of the pultrusion process.

2 â Tension roller
3 â Resin Impregnator
4 â Resin soaked fiber
5 â Die and heat source
6 â Pull mechanism
7 â Finished hardened fiber reinforced polymer
In the standard pultrusion process the reinforcement materials like fibers or
woven or braided strands are impregnated with resin, possibly followed by a
separate preforming system, and pulled through a heated stationary die where
the resin undergoes polymerization. The impregnation is either done by pulling
the reinforcement through a bath or by injecting the resin into an injection
chamber which typically is connected to the die. Many resin types may be used
in pultrusion including polyester, polyurethane, vinylester and epoxy. Resin
provides the resistance to the environment, (i.e., the corrosion resistance,
the UV resistance, the impact resistance, etc.) and the glass provides
strength, in addition to safety from fire.
A surface veil can also be added to protect against erosion or âfiber
bloomâ and provide corrosion resistance and ultraviolet resistance. [2]
The technology is not limited to thermosetting_polymers. More recently,
pultrusion has been successfully used with thermoplastic matrices such as
polybutylene_terephthalate (PBT), polyethylene_terephthalate (PET) either by
powder impregnation of the glass fiber or by surrounding it with sheet material
of the thermoplastic matrix, which is then heated.
Ecological cleanness of manufactured products, in contrast to composites on
thermosetting resins base, as well as practically unlimited possibilities of
recycling (processing) after the resource depletion appear to be forcible
arguments in favor of reinforced thermoplastics. For these reasons the
industrial output and use of the given materials in highly industrialized
countries have increased by 8â10% per year in recent decades. New
developments (see process modifications) which enable the manufacturing not
only of straight but also curved profiles are actually pushing the demand for
this technology, especially in the automotive sector.
Pultrusion technology of manufacturing of fiber composites with polymer matrix
appears to be energy-efficient and resource-saving.
Economic and environmental factors favor use of a thermoplastic matrix but due
to the high viscosity of melts it is difficult to achieve high productivity and
high quality of fiberfills impregnation with this type of matrix.
Products manufactured under this technology are widely used in the following
industries:
    * In the agriculture and chemical industries for manufacturing of
      chemically resistant to aggressive media slatted floors with enhanced
      strength characteristics used in the construction of livestock
      facilities, chemical plants, etc.;
    * in the construction industry for the production of glass-fiber
      reinforcement, profiles, carcasses, stiffening bars for PVC-windows,
      etc.;
    * in the aerospace industry for manufacturing of structure components of
      aircraft;
    * in the sports and tourism industries for manufacturing of equipment
      exhibiting enhanced strength properties: skis, ski poles, golf course
      flagsticks, tent and hovel constructions, etc.;
    * in electrical power engineering for manufacturing of dielectric
      structures, fiberglass rods used in composite insulators and as
      supporting structures for elements of signaling blocks, and fiberglass
      profiles used in manufacturing of transformers and electric motors;
    * in commercial production, using grains of long-fiber molding material
      (LLM) as a raw material for subsequent manufacturing of structures and
      products with enhanced strength and chemical properties;
    * in the automotive industry for the production of structural and complex
      parts of the vehicles with enhanced stiffness, rigidity and lightness;
    * and in many other industries and plants, using mechanisms, structures and
      materials, which meet high standards of chemical, dielectric and strength
      stability.
***** Process modifications[edit] *****
As the materials are pulled through a die in the standard pultrusion process
the process is only suited to manufacture straight profiles.
In a recently developed modification of the process, developed and patented by
Thomas GmbH + Co. Technik + Innovation KG, the die is no longer stationary but
moving back and forth along the profile to be manufactured. This modified
process, known as "Radius-Pultrusion" allows also to manufacture two- and
three-dimensional curved profiles. It also is beneficiary for a number of tasks
in the linear process especially if quite complex textile reinforcements with a
low rate of distortion are needed.

***** Equipment[edit] *****
The design of pultrusion machines varies. Two often used types are
reciprocating (hand-over-hand) and continuous (cat-track).
For the radius pultrusion process the layout of the machines has two moving
stages similar to the hand over hand pulling unit, but as the process is
intermittent with only one puller and the mould mounted on the stage of other
one. Whether the stages are moving linear or circular depends on the type of
profiles to be manufactured. The minimum radius for a linear machine with
rotating stages is approx. 2 m. For smaller radii a circular movement of the
mould and gripper stage is necessary.
