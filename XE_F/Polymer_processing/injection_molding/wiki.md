An injection moulding machine
Simplified diagram of the process
Injection moulding is a manufacturing process for producing parts by injecting
molten material into a mould. Injection moulding can be performed with a host
of materials mainly including metals (for which the process is called die-
casting), glasses, elastomers, confections, and most commonly thermoplastic and
thermosetting polymers. Material for the part is fed into a heated barrel,
mixed (Using a helical shaped screw), and injected (Forced) into a mould
cavity, where it cools and hardens to the configuration of the cavity.[1]:240
After a product is designed, usually by an industrial_designer or an engineer,
moulds are made by a mould-maker (or toolmaker) from metal, usually either
steel or aluminium, and precision-machined to form the features of the desired
part. Injection moulding is widely used for manufacturing a variety of parts,
from the smallest components to entire body_panels of cars. Advances in 3D
printing technology, using photopolymers which do not melt during the injection
moulding of some lower temperature thermoplastics, can be used for some simple
injection moulds.
Parts to be injection moulded must be very carefully designed to facilitate the
moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and
features of the part, the material of the mould, and the properties of the
moulding machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of injection
moulding is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and
possibilities.

***** Applications[edit] *****
Injection moulding is used to create many things such as wire spools,
packaging, bottle_caps, automotive parts and components, toys, pocket_combs,
some musical instruments (and parts of them), one-piece chairs and small
tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including gears), and most other
plastic products available today. Injection moulding is the most common modern
method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes
of the same object.[2]
***** Process characteristics[edit] *****
Thermoplastic resin pellets for injection moulding
Injection moulding uses a ram or screw-type plunger to force molten plastic
material into a mould cavity; this solidifies into a shape that has conformed
to the contour of the mould. It is most commonly used to process both
thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, with the volume used of the former
being considerably higher.[3]:1â3 Thermoplastics are prevalent due to
characteristics which make them highly suitable for injection moulding, such as
the ease with which they may be recycled, their versatility allowing them to be
used in a wide variety of applications,[3]:8â9 and their ability to soften
and flow upon heating. Thermoplastics also have an element of safety over
thermosets; if a thermosetting polymer is not ejected from the injection barrel
in a timely manner, chemical_crosslinking may occur causing the screw and check
valves to seize and potentially damaging the injection moulding machine.[3]:3
Injection moulding consists of the high pressure injection of the raw material
into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape.[3]:14 Moulds can
be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each
cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form
multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made
from tool_steels, but stainless_steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for
certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume
production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior
mechanical properties and are more prone to wear, damage, and deformation
during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-
effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are
considerably reduced.[1] Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a
million parts during their lifetime and can cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars to fabricate.
When thermoplastics are molded, typically pelletised raw material is fed
through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon entrance
to the barrel, the temperature increases and the Van_der_Waals_forces that
resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened as a result of increased
space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces
its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the
injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and
homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces
the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a
significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds
forward through a check_valve and collects at the front of the screw into a
volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill
the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion
(approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and
prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to
the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at
high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. The exact amount of
shrinkage is a function of the resin being used, and can be relatively
predictable.[4] To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a
transfer position corresponding to a 95â98% full cavity where the screw
shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection
times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the
packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for
thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many
other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity
entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first
place to solidify through its entire thickness.[3]:16 Once the gate solidifies,
no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and
acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools
so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is
dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from
an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been
achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are
driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process
is repeated.
For a two shot mould, two separate materials are incorporated into one part.
This type of injection moulding is used to add a soft touch to knobs, to give a
product multiple colours, or to produce a part with multiple performance
characteristics.[5]
For thermosets, typically two different chemical components are injected into
the barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions
which eventually crosslinks the material into a single connected network of
molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components
permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid.[3]:3 Solidification in the
injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions;
therefore, minimising the thermoset curing within the barrel is vital. This
typically means that the residence_time and temperature of the chemical
precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be
reduced by minimising the barrel's volume capacity and by maximising the cycle
times. These factors have led to the use of a thermally isolated, cold
injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated
hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in
shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the
part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical
precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts. Then, the mould
closes and the process repeats.
Pre-moulded or machined components can be inserted into the cavity while the
mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and
solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows
single parts to contain multiple materials. This process is often used to
create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened
and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould
labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.
A parting_line, sprue, gate marks, and ejector pin marks are usually present on
the final part.[3]:98 None of these features are typically desired, but are
unavoidable due to the nature of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate
which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming
cavity. Parting line and ejector pin marks result from minute misalignments,
wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or
dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer.
Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced
deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal
expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling
during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process.
Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of
thermal_expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without
astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and
quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these
aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.
***** History[edit] *****
American inventor John_Wesley_Hyatt, together with his brother Isaiah, patented
the first injection_moulding_machine in 1872.[6] This machine was relatively
simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large hypodermic
needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a
mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such
as collar_stays, buttons, and hair combs.
The German chemists Arthur_EichengrÃ¼n and Theodore Becker invented the first
soluble forms of cellulose acetate in 1903, which was much less flammable than
cellulose_nitrate.[7] It was eventually made available in a powder form from
which it was readily injection moulded. Arthur EichengrÃ¼n developed the first
injection moulding press in 1919. In 1939, Arthur EichengrÃ¼n patented the
injection moulding of plasticised cellulose acetate.
The industry expanded rapidly in the 1940s because World_War II created a huge
demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products.[8] In 1946, American inventor
James_Watson_Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much
more precise control over the speed of injection and the quality of articles
produced.[9] This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection,
so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and
mixed thoroughly before being injected. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop
the first gas-assisted injection moulding process, which permitted the
production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly
improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured
parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste. By 1979, plastic
production overtook steel production, and by 1990, aluminium molds were widely
used in injection molding.[10] Today, screw injection machines account for the
vast majority of all injection machines.
The plastic injection moulding industry has evolved over the years from
producing combs and buttons to producing a vast array of products for many
industries including automotive, medical, aerospace, consumer products, toys,
plumbing, packaging, and construction.[11]:1â2
***** Examples of polymers best suited for the process[edit] *****
Most polymers, sometimes referred to as resins, may be used, including all
thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers.[12] Since 1995, the total
number of available materials for injection moulding has increased at a rate of
750 per year; there were approximately 18,000 materials available when that
trend began.[13] Available materials include alloys or blends of previously
developed materials, so product designers can choose the material with the best
set of properties from a vast selection. Major criteria for selection of a
material are the strength and function required for the final part, as well as
the cost, but also each material has different parameters for moulding that
must be taken into account.[11]:6 Other considerations when choosing an
injection molding material include flexural modulus of elasticity, or the
degree to which a material can be bent without damage, as well as heat
deflection and water absorption.[14] Common polymers like epoxy and phenolic
are examples of thermosetting plastics while nylon, polyethylene, and
polystyrene are thermoplastic.[1]:242 Until comparatively recently, plastic
springs were not possible, but advances in polymer properties make them now
quite practical. Applications include buckles for anchoring and disconnecting
the outdoor-equipment webbing.
***** Equipment[edit] *****
Main article: Injection_moulding_machine
Paper clip mould opened in moulding machine; the nozzle is visible at right
Injection moulding machines consist of a material hopper, an injection ram or
screw-type plunger, and a heating unit.[1]:240 Also known as platens, they hold
the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage,
which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This
force keeps the mould closed during the injection process.[15] Tonnage can vary
from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in
comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed is
determined by the projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area
is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square
centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be
used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require
more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold
the mould closed.[11]:43â44 The required force can also be determined by the
material used and the size of the part. Larger parts require higher clamping
force.[12]
**** Mold[edit] ****
Mold or die are the common terms used to describe the tool used to produce
plastic parts in moulding.
Since moulds have been expensive to manufacture, they were usually only used in
mass production where thousands of parts were being produced. Typical moulds
are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or
beryllium-copper alloy.[16]:176 The choice of material to build a mould from is
primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct,
but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher
number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less
wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components;
their typical steel hardness is 38â45 on the Rockwell-C_scale. Hardened steel
moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of
wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60
Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when
designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for
moulding tens or even hundreds of thousands of parts. Beryllium copper is used
in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most
shear heat generated.[16]:176 The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC
machining or by using electrical_discharge_machining processes.

*** Mould design[edit] ***
Standard two plates tooling â core and cavity are inserts in a mould base â
"family mould" of five different parts
The mould consists of two primary components, the injection mould (A plate) and
the ejector mould (B plate). These components are also referred to as moulder
and mouldmaker. Plastic resin enters the mould through a sprue or gate in the
injection mould; the sprue bushing is to seal tightly against the nozzle of the
injection barrel of the moulding machine and to allow molten plastic to flow
from the barrel into the mould, also known as the cavity.[11]:141 The sprue
bushing directs the molten plastic to the cavity images through channels that
are machined into the faces of the A and B plates. These channels allow plastic
to run along them, so they are referred to as runners.[11]:142 The molten
plastic flows through the runner and enters one or more specialised gates and
into the cavity[17]:15 geometry to form the desired part.
Sprue, runner and gates in actual injection moulding product
The amount of resin required to fill the sprue, runner and cavities of a mould
comprises a "shot". Trapped air in the mould can escape through air vents that
are ground into the parting line of the mould, or around ejector pins and
slides that are slightly smaller than the holes retaining them. If the trapped
air is not allowed to escape, it is compressed by the pressure of the incoming
material and squeezed into the corners of the cavity, where it prevents filling
and can also cause other defects. The air can even become so compressed that it
ignites and burns the surrounding plastic material.[11]:147
To allow for removal of the moulded part from the mould, the mould features
must not overhang one another in the direction that the mould opens, unless
parts of the mould are designed to move from between such overhangs when the
mould opens (using components called Lifters).
Sides of the part that appear parallel with the direction of draw (the axis of
the cored position (hole) or insert is parallel to the up and down movement of
the mould as it opens and closes)[17]:406 are typically angled slightly, called
draft, to ease release of the part from the mould. Insufficient draft can cause
deformation or damage. The draft required for mould release is primarily
dependent on the depth of the cavity; the deeper the cavity, the more draft
necessary. Shrinkage must also be taken into account when determining the draft
required.[17]:332 If the skin is too thin, then the moulded part will tend to
shrink onto the cores that form while cooling and cling to those cores, or the
part may warp, twist, blister or crack when the cavity is pulled away.[11]:47
A mould is usually designed so that the moulded part reliably remains on the
ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue
out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when
ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould
gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is
machined into the surface of the mould on the parting_line. The moulded part is
cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould.[17]:288
Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either
half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded
product, or runner system out of a mould.[11]:143The ejection of the article
using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or
distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.
The standard method of cooling is passing a coolant (usually water) through a
series of holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form
a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has
absorbed heat from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature
to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.[11]:86
To ease maintenance and venting, cavities and cores are divided into pieces,
called inserts, and sub-assemblies, also called inserts, blocks, or chase
blocks. By substituting interchangeable inserts, one mould may make several
variations of the same part.
More complex parts are formed using more complex moulds. These may have
sections called slides, that move into a cavity perpendicular to the draw
direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the
slides are pulled away from the plastic part by using stationary âangle
pinsâ on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and
cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The
part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould
causes the slides to move forward along the angle pins.[11]:268
Some moulds allow previously moulded parts to be reinserted to allow a new
plastic layer to form around the first part. This is often referred to as
overmoulding. This system can allow for production of one-piece tires and
wheels.
Two-shot injection moulded keycaps from a computer keyboard
Two-shot or multi-shot moulds are designed to "overmould" within a single
moulding cycle and must be processed on specialised injection moulding machines
with two or more injection units. This process is actually an injection
moulding process performed twice and therefore has a much smaller margin of
error. In the first step, the base colour material is moulded into a basic
shape, which contains spaces for the second shot. Then the second material, a
different colour, is injection-moulded into those spaces. Pushbuttons and keys,
for instance, made by this process have markings that cannot wear off, and
remain legible with heavy use.[11]:174
A mould can produce several copies of the same parts in a single "shot". The
number of "impressions" in the mould of that part is often incorrectly referred
to as cavitation. A tool with one impression will often be called a single
impression (cavity) mould.[18]:398 A mould with 2 or more cavities of the same
parts will likely be referred to as multiple impression (cavity) mould.[18]:262
Some extremely high production volume moulds (like those for bottle caps) can
have over 128 cavities.
In some cases, multiple cavity tooling will mould a series of different parts
in the same tool. Some toolmakers call these moulds family moulds as all the
parts are related. Some examples include plastic model kits.[19]:114
*** Mould storage[edit] ***
Manufacturers go to great lengths to protect custom moulds due to their high
average costs. The perfect temperature and humidity level is maintained to
ensure the longest possible lifespan for each custom mould. Custom moulds, such
as those used for rubber injection moulding, are stored in temperature and
humidity controlled environments to prevent warping.
**** Tool materials[edit] ****
Tool steel is often used. Mild steel, aluminium, nickel or epoxy are suitable
only for prototype or very short production runs.[1] Modern hard aluminium
(7075 and 2024 alloys) with proper mould design, can easily make moulds capable
of 100,000 or more part life with proper mould maintenance.[20]

**** Machining[edit] ****
Moulds are built through two main methods: standard machining and EDM. Standard
machining, in its conventional form, has historically been the method of
building injection moulds. With technological developments, CNC machining
became the predominant means of making more complex moulds with more accurate
mould details in less time than traditional methods.
The electrical_discharge_machining_(EDM) or spark_erosion process has become
widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes that
are difficult to machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped
so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by
conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the
mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process
in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly
lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed
in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes
spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.[21]
**** Cost[edit] ****
The number of cavities incorporated into a mould will directly correlate in
moulding costs. Fewer cavities require far less tooling work, so limiting the
number of cavities in-turn will result in lower initial manufacturing costs to
build an injection mould.
As the number of cavities play a vital role in moulding costs, so does the
complexity of the part's design. Complexity can be incorporated into many
factors such as surface finishing, tolerance requirements, internal or external
threads, fine detailing or the number of undercuts that may be incorporated.
[22]
Further details, such as undercuts or any feature causing additional tooling,
will increase the mould cost. Surface finish of the core and cavity of moulds
will further influence the cost.
Rubber injection moulding process produces a high yield of durable products,
making it the most efficient and cost-effective method of moulding. Consistent
vulcanisation processes involving precise temperature control significantly
reduces all waste material.
***** Injection process[edit] *****

Video explanation
Small injection moulder showing hopper, nozzle and die area
With injection moulding, granular plastic is fed by a forced ram from a hopper
into a heated barrel. As the granules are slowly moved forward by a screw-type
plunger, the plastic is forced into a heated chamber, where it is melted. As
the plunger advances, the melted plastic is forced through a nozzle that rests
against the mould, allowing it to enter the mould cavity through a gate and
runner system. The mould remains cold so the plastic solidifies almost as soon
as the mould is filled.[1]
**** Injection moulding cycle[edit] ****
The sequence of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called
the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed
by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is
filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage.
In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw.
This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is
sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.[23]:13
**** Scientific versus traditional moulding[edit] ****
Traditionally, the injection portion of the moulding process was done at one
constant pressure to fill and pack the cavity. This method, however, allowed
for a large variation in dimensions from cycle-to-cycle. More commonly used now
is scientific or decoupled moulding, a method pioneered by RJG_Inc.[24][25][26]
In this the injection of the plastic is "decoupled" into stages to allow better
control of part dimensions and more cycle-to-cycle (commonly called shot-to-
shot in the industry) consistency. First the cavity is filled to approximately
98% full using velocity (speed) control. Although the pressure should be
sufficient to allow for the desired speed, pressure limitations during this
stage are undesirable. Once the cavity is 98% full, the machine switches from
velocity control to pressure control, where the cavity is "packed out" at a
constant pressure, where sufficient velocity to reach desired pressures is
required. This allows part dimensions to be controlled to within thousandths of
an inch or better.[27]
**** Different types of injection moulding processes[edit] ****

Although most injection moulding processes are covered by the conventional
process description above, there are several important moulding variations
including, but not limited to:
    * Die_casting
    * Metal_injection_moulding
    * Thin-wall_injection_moulding
    * Injection_moulding_of_liquid_silicone_rubber[23]:17â18
    * Reaction_injection_moulding

[1][28]
***** Process troubleshooting[edit] *****
Like all industrial processes, injection moulding can produce flawed parts. In
the field of injection moulding, troubleshooting is often performed by
examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects
with the design of the mould or the characteristics of the process itself.
Trials are often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict
defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in the injection
process.[3]:180
When filling a new or unfamiliar mould for the first time, where shot size for
that mould is unknown, a technician/tool setter may perform a trial run before
a full production run. They start with a small shot weight and fills gradually
until the mould is 95 to 99% full. Once this is achieved, a small amount of
holding pressure will be applied and holding time increased until gate freeze
off (solidification time) has occurred. Gate freeze off time can be determined
by increasing the hold time, and then weighing the part. When the weight of the
part does not change, it is then known that the gate has frozen and no more
material is injected into the part. Gate solidification time is important, as
this determines cycle time and the quality and consistency of the product,
which itself is an important issue in the economics of the production process.
[29] Holding pressure is increased until the parts are free of sinks and part
weight has been achieved.
**** Moulding defects[edit] ****
Injection moulding is a complex technology with possible production problems.
They can be caused either by defects in the moulds, or more often by the
moulding process itself.[3]:47â85

**** Tolerances[edit] ****
Moulding tolerance is a specified allowance on the deviation in parameters such
as dimensions, weights, shapes, or angles, etc. To maximise control in setting
tolerances there is usually a minimum and maximum limit on thickness, based on
the process used.[17]:439 Injection moulding typically is capable of tolerances
equivalent to an IT_Grade of about 9â14. The possible tolerance of a
thermoplastic or a thermoset is Â±0.008 to Â±0.002 inches.[30] In specialised
applications tolerances as low as Â±5 Âµm on both diameters and linear features
are achieved in mass production. Surface finishes of 0.0500 to 0.1000 Âµm or
better can be obtained. Rough or pebbled surfaces are also possible.

|Thermoset____|Â±0.500___|Â±0.200____|
***** Power requirements[edit] *****
The power required for this process of injection moulding depends on many
things and varies between materials used. Manufacturing Processes Reference
Guide states that the power requirements depend on "a material's specific
gravity, melting point, thermal conductivity, part size, and molding rate."
Below is a table from page 243 of the same reference as previously mentioned
that best illustrates the characteristics relevant to the power required for
the most commonly used materials.

***** Robotic moulding[edit] *****
Automation means that the smaller size of parts permits a mobile inspection
system to examine multiple parts more quickly. In addition to mounting
inspection systems on automatic devices, multiple-axis robots can remove parts
from the mould and position them for further processes.[31]
Specific instances include removing of parts from the mould immediately after
the parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot
grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from
the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto
an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, as well as
the general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on
robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile
robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal
component, and inspect faster than a human can.[31]
