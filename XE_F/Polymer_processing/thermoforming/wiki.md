Animation of the thermoforming process. 1- The plastic sheet is heated. 2- The
sheet is formed to a specific shape in a mold. 3- The shapes are trimmed.
Thermoforming is a manufacturing process where a plastic sheet is heated to a
pliable forming temperature, formed to a specific shape in a mold, and trimmed
to create a usable product. The sheet, or "film" when referring to thinner
gauges and certain material types, is heated in an oven to a high-enough
temperature that permits it to be stretched into or onto a mold and cooled to a
finished shape. Its simplified version is vacuum_forming.

In its simplest form, a small tabletop or lab size machine can be used to heat
small cut sections of plastic sheet and stretch it over a mold using vacuum.
This method is often used for sample and prototype parts. In complex and high-
volume applications, very large production machines are utilized to heat and
form the plastic sheet and trim the formed parts from the sheet in a continuous
high-speed process and can produce many thousands of finished parts per hour
depending on the machine and mold size and the size of the parts being formed.
Thermoforming differs from injection_molding, blow_molding, rotational_molding
and other forms of processing plastics. Thin-gauge thermoforming is primarily
the manufacture of disposable_cups, containers, lids, trays, blisters,
clamshells, and other products for the food, medical, and general retail
industries. Thick-gauge thermoforming includes parts as diverse as vehicle door
and dash panels, refrigerator liners, utility vehicle beds and plastic pallets.
In the most common method of high-volume, continuous thermoforming of thin-
gauge products, plastic sheet is fed from a roll or from an extruder into a set
of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and
transport it through an oven for heating to forming temperature. The heated
sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box
close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull
the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the
plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (Plug-assists are typically used in
addition to vacuum in the case of taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to
provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished
parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated
from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred
to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out
of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for
ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas.
The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the
same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web or
indexes into a separate trim press where the formed parts are trimmed. The
sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto
a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling.
Most thermoforming companies recycle their scrap and waste plastic, either by
compressing in a baling machine or by feeding into a granulator (grinder) and
producing ground flake, for sale to reprocessing companies or re-use in their
own facility. Frequently, scrap and waste plastic from the thermoforming
process is converted back into extruded sheet for forming again.

***** Thin-gauge and heavy-gauge (thick) thermoforming[edit] *****
There are two general thermoforming process categories. Sheet thickness less
than 1.5 mm (0.060 inches) is usually delivered to the thermoforming machine
from rolls or from a sheet extruder. Thin-gauge roll-fed or inline extruded
thermoforming applications are dominated by rigid or semi-rigid disposable
packaging. Sheet thicknesses greater than 3 mm (0.120 inches) are usually
delivered to the forming machine by hand or an auto-feed method already cut to
final dimensions. Heavy, or thick-gauge, cut sheet thermoforming applications
are primarily used as permanent structural components. There is a small but
growing medium-gauge market that forms sheet 1.5 mm to 3 mm in thickness.
Heavy-gauge forming utilizes the same basic process as continuous thin-gauge
sheet forming, typically draping the heated plastic sheet over a mold. Many
heavy-gauge forming applications use vacuum only in the form process, although
some use two halves of mating form tooling and include air pressure to help
form. Aircraft windscreens and machine gun turret_windows spurred the advance
of heavy-gauge forming technology during World War II. Heavy-gauge parts are
used as cosmetic surfaces on permanent structures such as kiosks, automobiles,
trucks, medical equipment, material handling equipment, refrigerators, spas,
and shower enclosures, and electrical and electronic equipment. Unlike most
thin-gauge thermoformed parts, heavy-gauge parts are often hand-worked after
forming for trimming to final shape or for additional drilling, cutting, or
finishing, depending on the product. Heavy-gauge products typically are of a
"permanent" end use nature, while thin-gauge parts are more often designed to
be disposable or recyclable and are primarily used to package or contain a food
item or product. Heavy-gauge thermoforming is typically used for production
quantities of 250 to 3000 annually, with lower tooling costs and faster product
development than competing plastic technologies like injection_molding.
***** Engineering[edit] *****
Thermoforming has benefited from applications of engineering technology[3],
although the basic forming process is very similar to what was invented many
years ago. Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow
for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from
one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing
settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheet into an inline trim
station for more precise trim registration has been hugely improved due to the
common use of electric servo motors for chain indexing versus air cylinders,
gear racks, and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used
on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the
machine platens where form and trim tooling are mounted, rather than air
cylinders which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more
precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling.
Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and
thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for
zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat..
A new technology, ToolVu, has been developed to provide real-time feedback on
thermoformer machines[7]. This stand-alone system connects directly to the
thermoformer and utilizes multiple sensors to record production-run data in
real time including air pressure, temperature, tool strain gauge and other
specifications. The system sends out multiple warnings and alerts whenever pre-
set production parameters are compromised during a run. This reduces machine
down time, lowers startup time and decreases startup scrap.
An integral part of the thermoforming process is the tooling, which is specific
to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described
above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires
molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim
tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge
thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part
size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite
material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically, thick-gauge
parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand
routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited to the
quality of the tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have
design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside
tool-making shops to build the tooling.

***** Industry[edit] *****
The more than US\$10 billion North American market has traditionally been Â¾
thin gauge and Â¼ heavy gauge. In 2003 there were about 150 thin-gauge
thermoformers in North America. Sixty percent formed proprietary products.
Thirty percent were custom formers and 10 percent were OEMs with in-house
forming capability. There were nearly a dozen thin-gauge formers having annual
sales of at least US\$100 million. The largest had annual sales in excess of
US\$1,000 million. There were about 250 heavy-gauge formers in North America.
Nearly all were custom formers. Only two or three heavy-gauge formers had
annual sales of more than US\$100 million. The largest had annual sales of
about US\$140 million.[2] Beaverton,_Michigan, is known as the Plastic
Thermoforming capital of the world fueled by the proximity of Dow_Chemical
Company of Midland,_Michigan.
