or stay up overnight can lead to fatigue.
Specialty   Psychiatry
Fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness that has a gradual onset. Unlike
weakness, fatigue can be alleviated by periods of rest. Fatigue can have
physical or mental causes. Physical fatigue is the transient inability of
muscles to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by
intense physical_exercise.[1][2][3] Mental fatigue is a transient decrease in
maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive
activity. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed_attention
fatigue.[4]
Medically, fatigue is a non-specific_symptom, meaning it has many possible
causes and accompanies many different conditions. Fatigue is considered a
symptom, rather than a sign, because it is a subjective feeling reported by the
patient, rather than an objective sign that can be observed by others. Fatigue
and 'feelings of fatigue' are sometimes confused.[5]

**** Physical fatigue[edit] ****
Main article: Muscle_fatigue
Physical fatigue, or muscle fatigue, is the temporary physical inability of
muscles to perform optimally. The onset of muscle fatigue during physical
activity is gradual, and depends upon an individual's level of physical fitness
â other factors include sleep_deprivation and overall health. Fatigue can be
reversed by rest.[6] Physical fatigue can be caused by a lack of energy in the
muscle, by a decrease of the efficiency of the neuromuscular junction or by a
reduction of the drive originating from the central_nervous_system.[7] The
central component of fatigue is triggered by an increase of the level of
serotonin in the central nervous system.[8] During motor activity, serotonin
released in synapses that contact motoneurons promotes muscle contraction.[9]
During high level of motor activity, the amount of serotonin released increases
and a spillover occurs. Serotonin binds to extrasynaptic receptors located on
the axon initial segment of motoneurons with the result that nerve_impulse
initiation and thereby muscle contraction are inhibited.[10]
Muscle strength testing can be used to determine the presence of a
neuromuscular_disease, but cannot determine its cause. Additional testing, such
as electromyography, can provide diagnostic information, but information gained
from muscle strength testing alone is not enough to diagnose most neuromuscular
disorders.[11]
People with multiple_sclerosis experience a form of overwhelming lassitude or
tiredness that can occur at any time of the day, for any duration, and that
does not necessarily recur in a recognizable pattern for any given patient,
referred to as "neurological fatigue".[12][13]
**** Mental fatigue[edit] ****
Mental fatigue is a temporary inability to maintain optimal cognitive
performance. The onset of mental fatigue during any cognitive activity is
gradual, and depends upon an individual's cognitive ability, and also upon
other factors, such as sleep deprivation and overall health. Mental fatigue has
also been shown to decrease physical performance.[4] It can manifest as
somnolence, lethargy, or directed_attention_fatigue. Decreased attention may
also be described as a more or less decreased level_of_consciousness.[14] In
any case, this can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant
concentration, such as operating large vehicles. For instance, a person who is
sufficiently somnolent may experience microsleep. However, objective cognitive
testing can be used to differentiate the neurocognitive deficits of brain
disease from those attributable to tiredness.[citation_needed]
The perception of mental fatigue is believed to be modulated by the brain's
reticular_activating_system (RAS).[citation_needed]
***** Presentation[edit] *****
**** Complications[edit] ****
Fatigue impacts a driver's reaction time, awareness of hazards around them and
their attention. Drowsy drivers are three times more likely to be involved in a
car crash and if they are awake over 20 hours, is the equivalent of driving
with a blood-alcohol concentration level of 0.08%.[15]
***** Causes[edit] *****
Fatigue is a normal result of working, mental stress, overstimulation and
understimulation, jet_lag or active recreation, depression, boredom, disease,
and lack_of_sleep. It may also have chemical causes, such as dehydration,
poisoning, low_blood_sugar, or mineral or vitamin deficiencies. Chronic blood
loss frequently results in fatigue, as do other conditions that cause anemia.
Fatigue is different from drowsiness, where a patient feels that sleep is
required. Fatigue is a normal response to physical exertion or stress, but can
also be a sign of a physical disorder.
Temporary fatigue is likely to be a minor illness like the common_cold as one
part of the sickness_behavior response that happens when the immune_system
fights an infection.
**** Chronic fatigue[edit] ****
Prolonged fatigue is a self-reported, persistent (constant) fatigue lasting at
least one month. Chronic fatigue is a self-reported fatigue lasting at least
six consecutive months. Chronic fatigue may be either persistent or relapsing.
[16] Chronic fatigue is a symptom of many diseases and conditions. Some major
categories of conditions that feature fatigue include:
    * Autoimmune_diseases such as celiac_disease, lupus, multiple_sclerosis,
      myasthenia_gravis, SjÃ¶gren's_syndrome, and spondyloarthropathy
    * Blood_disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis
    * Cancer, in which case it is called cancer_fatigue
    * Chronic_fatigue_syndrome (CFS)[17]
    * Drug_abuse including alcohol_abuse[17]
    * Depression and other mental disorders that feature depressed_mood
    * Developmental_disorders such as autism_spectrum_disorder
    * Eating_disorders, which can produce fatigue due to inadequate nutrition
    * Endocrine_diseases: diabetes_mellitus and hypothyroidism
    * Fibromyalgia
    * Gulf_War_syndrome
    * Heart_diseases such as heart_failure
    * HIV
    * Inborn_errors_of_metabolism such as fructose_malabsorption.[18][19]
    * Infectious_diseases such as infectious_mononucleosis.
    * Irritable_bowel_syndrome
    * Leukemia or lymphoma
    * Liver_failure
    * Lyme_disease
    * Neurological_disorders such as narcolepsy, Parkinson's_disease and post-
      concussion_syndrome
    * Physical_trauma and other pain-causing conditions, such as arthritis
    * Sleep_deprivation or sleep_disorders
    * Spring_fever
    * Stroke
    * Thyroid_disease such as hypothyroidism
    * Uremia, which is caused by kidney_disease
Fatigue may also be a side effect of certain medications (e.g., lithium_salts,
ciprofloxacin); beta_blockers, which can induce exercise_intolerance; and many
cancer treatments, particularly chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
***** Diagnosis[edit] *****
Minor dark_circles, in addition to a hint of eye_bags, a combination which is
suggestive of sleep_deprivation and/or mental fatigue.
One study concluded about 50% of people who have fatigue receive a diagnosis
that could explain the fatigue after a year with the condition. In those people
who have a possible diagnosis, musculoskeletal (19.4%) and psychological
problems (16.5%) are the most common. Definitive physical conditions were only
found in 8.2% of cases.[20]
If a person with fatigue decides to seek medical advice, the overall goal is to
identify and rule out any treatable conditions. This is done by considering the
person's medical_history, any other symptoms that are present, and evaluating
of the qualities of the fatigue itself. The affected person may be able to
identify patterns to the fatigue, such as being more tired at certain times of
day, whether fatigue increases throughout the day, and whether fatigue is
reduced after taking a nap.
Because disrupted sleep is a significant contributor to fatigue, a diagnostic
evaluation considers the quality of sleep, the emotional state of the person,
sleep pattern, and stress level. The amount of sleep, the hours that are set
aside for sleep, and the number of times that a person awakens during the night
are important. A sleep_study may be ordered to rule out a sleep_disorder.
Depression and other psychological conditions can produce fatigue, so people
who report fatigue are routinely screened for these conditions, along with drug
abuse, poor diet, and lack of physical_exercise, which paradoxically increases
fatigue.
Basic medical_tests may be performed to rule out common causes of fatigue.
These include blood_tests to check for infection or anemia, a urinalysis to
look for signs of liver_disease or diabetes_mellitus, and other tests to check
for kidney and liver function, such as a comprehensive_metabolic_panel.[21]
Other tests may be chosen depending on the patient's social history, such as an
HIV_test or pregnancy_test.
**** Comparison with sleepiness[edit] ****
Fatigue is generally considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness
(somnolence).[22] Although sleepiness can be a symptom of medical issues, it
usually results from lack of restful sleep, or a lack of stimulation.[23]
Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, is a symptom of a greater medical problem
in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to
complete tasks at normal performance.[24] Both are often used interchangeably
and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Fatigue is often
described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas sleepiness is comfortable and
inviting.
**** Measurement[edit] ****
Fatigue can be quantitatively measured. Devices to measure medical fatigue have
been developed by Japanese companies, among them Nintendo.[25] Nevertheless
such devices are not in common use outside Japan.
