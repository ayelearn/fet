An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible
(unmixable or unblendable). Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-
phase systems of matter called colloids. Although the terms colloid and
emulsion are sometimes used interchangeably, emulsion should be used when both
phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid (the
dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of
emulsions include vinaigrettes, homogenized milk, and some cutting_fluids for
metal_working.
The word "emulsion" comes from the Latin mulgeo, mulgere "to milk",[specify] as
milk is an emulsion of fat and water, along with other components.
Two liquids can form different types of emulsions. As an example, oil and water
can form, first, an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the oil is the dispersed
phase, and water is the continuous phase. (Lipoproteins, used by all complex
living organisms, are one example of this.) Second, they can form a water-in-
oil emulsion, wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous
phase. Multiple emulsions are also possible, including a "water-in-oil-in-
water" emulsion and an "oil-in-water-in-oil" emulsion.[1]
Emulsions, being liquids, do not exhibit a static internal structure. The
droplets dispersed in the continuous phase (sometimes referred to as the
âdispersion mediumâ) are usually assumed to be statistically_distributed.
The term "emulsion" is also used to refer to the photo-sensitive side of
photographic_film. Such a photographic_emulsion consists of silver_halide
colloidal particles dispersed in a gelatin matrix. Nuclear_emulsions are
similar to photographic emulsions, except that they are used in particle
physics to detect high-energy elementary_particles.

***** Appearance and properties[edit] *****
IUPAC definition
Fluid system in which liquid droplets are dispersed in a liquid.
Note 1: The definition is based on the definition in ref.[2]
Note 2: The droplets may be amorphous, liquid-crystalline, or any
mixture thereof.
Note 3: The diameters of the droplets constituting the dispersed_phase
usually range from approximately 10 nm to 100 Î¼m; i.e., the droplets
may exceed the usual size limits for colloidal particles.
Note 4: An emulsion is termed an oil/water (o/w) emulsion if the
dispersed phase is an organic material and the continuous phase is
water or an aqueous solution and is termed water/oil (w/o) if the dispersed
phase is water or an aqueous solution and the continuous phase is an
organic liquid (an "oil").
Note 5: A w/o emulsion is sometimes called an inverse emulsion.
The term "inverse emulsion" is misleading, suggesting incorrectly that
the emulsion has properties that are the opposite of those of an emulsion.
Its use is, therefore, not recommended.[3]
Emulsions contain both a dispersed and a continuous phase, with the boundary
between the phases called the "interface"[4]. Emulsions tend to have a cloudy
appearance because the many phase_interfaces scatter light as it passes through
the emulsion. Emulsions appear white when all light is scattered equally. If
the emulsion is dilute enough, higher-frequency (low-wavelength) light will be
scattered more, and the emulsion will appear bluer â this is called the
"Tyndall_effect".[citation_needed]If the emulsion is concentrated enough, the
color will be distorted toward comparatively longer wavelengths, and will
appear more yellow. This phenomenon is easily observable when comparing skimmed
milk, which contains little fat, to cream, which contains a much higher
concentration of milk fat. One example would be a mixture of water and oil.
[citation_needed]
Two special classes of emulsions â microemulsions and nanoemulsions, with
droplet sizes below 100 nm â appear translucent.[5] This property is due to
the fact that light waves are scattered by the droplets only if their sizes
exceed about one-quarter of the wavelength of the incident light. Since the
visible_spectrum of light is composed of wavelengths between 390 and 750
nanometers (nm), if the droplet sizes in the emulsion are below about 100 nm,
the light can penetrate through the emulsion without being scattered.[6] Due to
their similarity in appearance, translucent nanoemulsions and microemulsions
are frequently confused. Unlike translucent nanoemulsions, which require
specialized equipment to be produced, microemulsions are spontaneously formed
by âsolubilizingâ oil molecules with a mixture of surfactants, co-
surfactants, and co-solvents.[5] The required surfactant concentration in a
microemulsion is, however, several times higher than that in a translucent
nanoemulsion, and significantly exceeds the concentration of the dispersed
phase. Because of many undesirable side-effects caused by surfactants, their
presence is disadvantageous or prohibitive in many applications. In addition,
the stability of a microemulsion is often easily compromised by dilution, by
heating, or by changing pH levels.[citation_needed]
Common emulsions are inherently unstable and, thus, do not tend to form
spontaneously. Energy input â through shaking, stirring, homogenizing, or
exposure to power ultrasound[7] â is needed to form an emulsion. Over time,
emulsions tend to revert to the stable state of the phases comprising the
emulsion. An example of this is seen in the separation of the oil and vinegar
components of vinaigrette, an unstable emulsion that will quickly separate
unless shaken almost continuously. There are important exceptions to this
rule â microemulsions are thermodynamically stable, while translucent
nanoemulsions are kinetically stable.[5]
Whether an emulsion of oil and water turns into a "water-in-oil" emulsion or an
"oil-in-water" emulsion depends on the volume fraction of both phases and the
type of emulsifier (surfactant) (see Emulsifier, below) present.[citation
needed] In general, the Bancroft_rule applies. Emulsifiers and emulsifying
particles tend to promote dispersion of the phase in which they do not dissolve
very well. For example, proteins dissolve better in water than in oil, and so
tend to form oil-in-water emulsions (that is, they promote the dispersion of
oil droplets throughout a continuous phase of water).[citation_needed]
The geometric structure of an emulsion mixture of two lyophobic liquids with a
large concentration of the secondary component is fractal: Emulsion particles
unavoidably form dynamic inhomogeneous structures on small length scale. The
geometry of these structures is fractal. The size of elementary irregularities
is governed by a universal function which depends on the volume content of the
components. The fractal dimension of these irregularities is 2.5.[8]
**** Instability[edit] ****
Emulsion stability refers to the ability of an emulsion to resist change in its
properties over time.[9][10] There are four types of instability in emulsions:
flocculation, creaming/sedimentation, coalescence, and Ostwald_ripening.
Flocculation occurs when there is an attractive force between the droplets, so
they form flocs, like bunches of grapes. This process can be desired, if
controlled in its extent, to tune physical properties of emulsions such as
their flow behaviour. [11] Coalescence occurs when droplets bump into each
other and combine to form a larger droplet, so the average droplet size
increases over time. Emulsions can also undergo creaming, where the droplets
rise to the top of the emulsion under the influence of buoyancy, or under the
influence of the centripetal_force induced when a centrifuge is used.[9]
Creaming is a common phenomenon in dairy and non-dairy beverages (i.e. milk,
coffee milk, almond milk, soy milk) and usually does not change the droplet
size.[12] Sedimentation is the opposite phenomenon of creaming and normally
observed in water-in-oil emulsions[4]. Sedimentation happens when the dispersed
phase is denser than the continuous phase and the gravitational forces pull the
denser globules towards the bottom of the emulsion. Similar to creaming,
sedimentation follows Stokeâs law.
An appropriate "surface active agent" (or "surfactant") can increase the
kinetic stability of an emulsion so that the size of the droplets does not
change significantly with time. The stability of an emulsion, like a
suspension, can be studied in terms of zeta_potential, which indicates the
repulsion between droplets or particles. If the size and dispersion of droplets
does not change over time, it is said to be stable.[citation_needed] For
example, oil-in-water emulsions containing mono-_and_diglycerides and milk
protein as surfactant showed that stable oil droplet size over 28 days storage
at 25Â°C.[12]
**** Monitoring physical stability[edit] ****
The stability of emulsions can be characterized using techniques such as light
scattering, focused beam reflectance measurement, centrifugation, and rheology.
Each method has advantages and disadvantages.[citation_needed]
**** Accelerating methods for shelf life prediction[edit] ****
The kinetic process of destabilization can be rather long â up to several
months, or even years for some products.[citation_needed] Often the formulator
must accelerate this process in order to test products in a reasonable time
during product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used â these
consist of increasing the emulsion temperature to accelerate destabilization
(if below critical temperatures for phase inversion or chemical degradation).
[citation_needed] Temperature affects not only the viscosity but also the
inter-facial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or, on a broader
scope, interactions of forces inside the system. Storing an emulsion at high
temperatures enables the simulation of realistic conditions for a product
(e.g., a tube of sunscreen emulsion in a car in the summer heat), but also to
accelerate destabilization processes up to 200 times.[citation_needed]
Mechanical methods of acceleration, including vibration, centrifugation, and
agitation, can also be used.[citation_needed]
These methods are almost always empirical, without a sound scientific basis.
[citation_needed]
***** Emulsifiers[edit] *****
An emulsifier (also known as an "emulgent") is a substance that stabilizes an
emulsion by increasing its kinetic_stability. One class of emulsifiers is known
as "surface active agents", or surfactants. Emulsifiers are compounds that
typically have a polar or hydrophilic (i.e. water-soluble) part and a non-polar
(i.e. hydrophobic or lipophilic) part. Because of this, emulsifiers tend to
have more or less solubility either in water or in oil.[citation_needed]
Emulsifiers that are more soluble in water (and conversely, less soluble in
oil) will generally form oil-in-water emulsions, while emulsifiers that are
more soluble in oil will form water-in-oil emulsions. [13]
Examples of food emulsifiers are:
    * Egg_yolk â in which the main emulsifying agent is lecithin. In fact,
      lecithos is the Greek word for egg yolk.
    * Mustard â where a variety of chemicals in the mucilage surrounding the
      seed hull act as emulsifiers
    * Soy_lecithin is another emulsifier and thickener
    * Pickering_stabilization â uses particles under certain circumstances
    * Sodium_phosphates
    * Mono-_and_diglycerides - a common emulsifier found in many food products
      (coffee creamers, ice-creams, spreads, breads, cakes)
    * Sodium_stearoyl_lactylate
    * DATEM (diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides) â an
      emulsifier used primarily in baking
    * Simple cellulose â a particulate_emulsifier derived from plant material
      using only water
Detergents are another class of surfactant, and will interact physically with
both oil and water, thus stabilizing the interface between the oil and water
droplets in suspension. This principle is exploited in soap, to remove grease
for the purpose of cleaning. Many different emulsifiers are used in pharmacy to
prepare emulsions such as creams and lotions. Common examples include
emulsifying_wax, polysorbate_20, and ceteareth_20.[14]
Sometimes the inner phase itself can act as an emulsifier, and the result is a
nanoemulsion, where the inner state disperses into "nano-size" droplets within
the outer phase. A well-known example of this phenomenon, the "ouzo_effect",
happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic anise-based beverage, such
as ouzo, pastis, absinthe, arak, or raki. The anisolic compounds, which are
soluble in ethanol, then form nano-size droplets and emulsify within the water.
The resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white.
***** Mechanisms of emulsification[edit] *****
A number of different chemical and physical processes and mechanisms can be
involved in the process of emulsification:[citation_needed]
    * Surface tension theory â according to this theory, emulsification takes
      place by reduction of interfacial tension between two phases
    * Repulsion theory â the emulsifying agent creates a film over one phase
      that forms globules, which repel each other. This repulsive force causes
      them to remain suspended in the dispersion medium
    * Viscosity modification â emulgents like acacia and tragacanth, which
      are hydrocolloids, as well as PEG (or polyethylene_glycol), glycerine,
      and other polymers like CMC (carboxymethyl_cellulose), all increase the
      viscosity of the medium, which helps create and maintain the suspension
      of globules of dispersed phase
***** Uses[edit] *****
**** In food[edit] ****
Oil-in-water emulsions are common in food products:
    * Crema (foam) in espresso â coffee oil in water (brewed coffee),
      unstable emulsion
    * Mayonnaise and Hollandaise_sauces â these are oil-in-water emulsions
      stabilized with egg yolk lecithin, or with other types of food additives,
      such as sodium_stearoyl_lactylate
    * Homogenized_milk â an emulsion of milk fat in water, with milk proteins
      as the emulsifier
    * Vinaigrette â an emulsion of vegetable oil in vinegar, if this is
      prepared using only oil and vinegar (i.e., without an emulsifier), an
      unstable emulsion results
Water-in-oil emulsions are less common in food, but still exist:
    * Butter â an emulsion of water in butterfat
    * Margarine
Other foods can be turned into products similar to emulsions, for example meat
emulsion is a suspension of meat in liquid that is similar to true emulsions.
**** Health care[edit] ****
In pharmaceutics, hairstyling, personal_hygiene, and cosmetics, emulsions are
frequently used. These are usually oil and water emulsions but dispersed, and
which is continuous depends in many cases on the pharmaceutical_formulation.
These emulsions may be called creams, ointments, liniments (balms), pastes,
films, or liquids, depending mostly on their oil-to-water ratios, other
additives, and their intended route_of_administration.[15][16] The first 5 are
topical dosage_forms, and may be used on the surface of the skin,
transdermally, ophthalmically, rectally, or vaginally. A highly liquid emulsion
may also be used orally, or may be injected in some cases.[15]
Microemulsions are used to deliver vaccines and kill microbes.[17] Typical
emulsions used in these techniques are nanoemulsions of soybean_oil, with
particles that are 400â600 nm in diameter.[18] The process is not chemical,
as with other types of antimicrobial treatments, but mechanical. The smaller
the droplet the greater the surface_tension and thus the greater the force
required to merge with other lipids. The oil is emulsified with detergents
using a high-shear_mixer to stabilize the emulsion so, when they encounter the
lipids in the cell_membrane or envelope of bacteria or viruses, they force the
lipids to merge with themselves. On a mass scale, in effect this disintegrates
the membrane and kills the pathogen. The soybean oil emulsion does not harm
normal human cells, or the cells of most other higher_organisms, with the
exceptions of sperm_cells and blood_cells, which are vulnerable to
nanoemulsions due to the peculiarities of their membrane structures. For this
reason, these nanoemulsions are not currently used intravenously (IV). The most
effective application of this type of nanoemulsion is for the disinfection of
surfaces. Some types of nanoemulsions have been shown to effectively destroy
HIV-1 and tuberculosis pathogens on non-porous surfaces.
**** In firefighting[edit] ****
Emulsifying agents are effective at extinguishing fires on small, thin-layer
spills of flammable liquids (class_B_fires). Such agents encapsulate the fuel
in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the flammable vapors in the water
phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an aqueous surfactant solution to
the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at
extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount
of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment is a function of the volume of
the fuel, whereas other agents such as aqueous_film-forming_foam need cover
only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.[19]
**** Chemical synthesis[edit] ****
Main article: Emulsion_polymerization
Emulsions are used to manufacture polymer dispersions â polymer production in
an emulsion 'phase' has a number of process advantages, including prevention of
coagulation of product. Products produced by such polymerisations may be used
as the emulsions â products including primary components for glues and
paints. Synthetic latexes (rubbers) are also produced by this process.
