***** Science and medicine[edit] *****
    * Kinetics_(physics), the study of motion and its causes
          o Rigid_body_kinetics, the study of the motion of rigid bodies
    * Chemical_kinetics, the study of chemical reaction rates
          o Enzyme_kinetics, the study of biochemical reaction rates catalysed
            by an enzyme

          o Receptorâligand_kinetics, a branch of chemical kinetics in which
            the kinetic species are defined by different non-covalent bindings
            and/or conformations of the molecules involved, which are denoted
            as receptor(s) and ligand(s)
                # Hill_kinetics
    * Pharmacokinetics, the study of the processes a substance undergoes in the
      human body, particularly the rates at which it is absorbed, distributed,
      metabolised and excreted
          o One-compartment_kinetics, for a chemical compound specifies that
            the uptake in the compartment is proportional to the concentration
            outside the compartment, and the elimination is proportional to the
            concentration inside the compartment
          o Flip-flop_kinetics, the pharmacokinetics of sustained-release or
            extended-release drug formulations
          o Toxicokinetics, the branch of pharmacokinetics dealing with
            compounds that are toxic or can be administered in toxic doses

***** See also[edit] *****
    * Dynamics_(disambiguation)
    * Kinetic_(disambiguation)
    * Kinematics, a branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of
      particles (alternatively "points"), objects ("bodies"), and groups of
      objects ("systems of bodies") without considering the mass of each or the
      forces that caused the motion
    * Analytical_mechanics, a collection of closely related alternative
      formulations of classical mechanics
    * Analytical_dynamics, concerned about the relationship between motion of
      bodies and its causes, namely the forces acting on the bodies and the
      properties of the bodies (particularly mass and moment of inertia)
