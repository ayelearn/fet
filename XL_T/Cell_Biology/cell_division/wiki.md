****** Cell division ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The process resulting in division and partitioning of components of a cell to
form more cells; may or may not be accompanied by the physical separation of a
cell into distinct, individually membrane-bounded daughter cells.
Not to be confused with cellular_differentiation.
Three types of cell division
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more
daughter cells.[1] Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell_cycle.
In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative
division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent
cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of
chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes
(meiosis).[2] Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one
round of DNA replication followed by two divisions. Homologous_chromosomes are
separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the
second division. Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of
sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be
present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.
Prokaryotes (bacteria) undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary
fission, where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter
cells. While binary fission may be the means of division by most prokaryotes,
there are alternative manners of division, such as budding, that have been
observed. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single
round of DNA_replication.
For simple unicellular microorganisms such as the amoeba, one cell division is
equivalent to reproduction â an entire new organism is created. On a larger
scale, mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms,
such as plants that grow from cuttings. Mitotic cell division enables sexually
reproducing organisms to develop from the one-celled zygote, which itself was
produced by meiotic cell division from gametes.[3][4] After growth, cell
division by mitosis allows for continual construction and repair of the
organism.[5] The human body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in
a lifetime.[6]
The primary concern of cell division is the maintenance of the original cell's
genome. Before division can occur, the genomic information that is stored in
chromosomes must be replicated, and the duplicated genome must be separated
cleanly between cells.[7] A great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved
in keeping genomic information consistent between generations.

**** Interphase[edit] ****
Interphase is the process a cell must go through before mitosis, meiosis, and
cytokinesis.[8] Interphase consists of three main phases: G1, S, and G2. G1 is
a time of growth for the cell where specialized cellular functions occur in
order to prepare the cell for DNA Replication.[9] There are checkpoints during
interphase that allow the cell to be either advance or halt further
development. In S phase, the chromosomes are replicated in order for the
genetic content to be maintained.[10] During G2, the cell undergoes the final
stages of growth before it enters the M phase, where spindles are synthesized.
The M phase, can be either mitosis or meiosis depending on the type of cell.
Germ_cells, or gametes, undergo meiosis, while somatic_cells will undergo
mitosis. After the cell proceeds successfully through the M phase, it may then
undergo cell division through cytokinesis. The control of each checkpoint is
controlled by cyclin and cyclin-dependent_kinases. The progression of
interphase is the result of the increased amount of cyclin. As the amount of
cyclin increases, more and more cyclin dependent kinases attach to cyclin
signaling the cell further into interphase. At the peak of the cyclin attached
to the cyclin dependent kinases this system pushes the cell out of interphase
and into the M phase, where mitosis, meiosis, and cytokinesis occur.[11] There
are three transition checkpoints the cell goes through before entering the M
phase. The most important being the G1-S transition checkpoint. If the cell
does not pass this checkpoint, then the cell will exit the cell cycle.[12]
**** Prophase[edit] ****
Prophase is the first stage of division. The nuclear envelope is broken down,
long strands of chromatin condense to form shorter more visible strands called
chromosomes, the nucleolus disappears, and microtubules attach to the
chromosomes at the kinetochores present in the centromere.[13] Microtubules
associated with the alignment and separation of chromosomes are referred to as
the spindle and spindle fibers. Chromosomes will also be visible under a
microscope and will be connected at the centromere. During this condensation
and alignment period in meiosis, the homologous chromosomes undergo a break in
their double-stranded DNA at the same locations followed by a recombination of
the now fragmented parental DNA strands into non-parental combinations, known
as crossing over.[14] This process is evidenced to be caused in a large part by
the highly conserved Spo11 protein through a mechanism similar to that seen
with toposomerase in DNA replication and transcription.[15]
**** Metaphase[edit] ****
In metaphase, the centromeres of the chromosomes convene themselves on the
metaphase plate (or equatorial plate), an imaginary line that is equidistant
from the two centrosome poles and held together by complex complexes known as
cohesins. Chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell by microtubule
organizing_centers (MTOCs) pushing and pulling on centromeres of both
chromatids thereby causing the chromosome to move to the center. At this point
the chromosomes are still condensing and are currently one step away from being
the most coiled and condensed they will be, and the spindle fibers have already
connected to the kinetochores.[16] During this phase all the microtubules, with
the exception of the kinetochores, are in a state of instability promoting
their progression towards anaphase.[17] At this point, the chromosomes are
ready to split into opposite poles of the cell towards the spindle to which
they are connected.[18]
**** Anaphase[edit] ****
Anaphase is a very short stage of the cell cycle and occurs after the
chromosomes align at the mitotic plate. Kinetochores emit anaphase-inhibition
signals until their attachment to the mitotic spindle. Once the final
chromosome is properly aligned and attached the final signal dissipates and
triggers the abrupt shift to anaphase.[19] This abrupt shift is caused by the
activation of the anaphase-promoting_complex and its function of tagging
degradation of proteins important towards the metaphase-anaphase transition.
One of these proteins that is broken down is securin which through its
breakdown releases the enzyme separase that cleaves the cohesin rings holding
together the sister chromatids thereby leading to the chromosomes separating.
[20] After the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell, the spindle
fibers will pull them apart. The chromosomes are split apart as the sister
chromatids move to opposite sides of the cell.[21] While the sister chromatids
are being pulled apart, the cell and plasma are elongated by non-kinetochore
microtubules.[22]
**** Telophase[edit] ****
Telophase is the last stage of the cell cycle in which a cleavage furrow splits
the cells cytoplasm (cytokinesis) and chromatin. This occurs through the
synthesis of a new nuclear envelopes that forms around the chromatin gathered
at each pole and the reformation of the nucleolus as the chromosomes decondense
their chromatin back to the loose state it possessed during interphase.[23][24]
The division of the cellular contents is not always equal and can vary by cell
type as seen with oocyte formation where one of the four daughter cells possess
the majority of the cytoplasm.[25]
***** Variants[edit] *****

chromosomes (DNA) in blue, and kinetochores in red.
Cells are broadly classified into two main categories: simple, non-nucleated
prokaryotic cells, and complex, nucleated eukaryotic cells. Due to their
structural differences, eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells do not divide in the
same way. Also, the pattern of cell division that transforms eukaryotic stem
cells into gametes (sperm cells in males or egg cells in females), termed
meiosis, is different from that of the division of somatic cells in the body.

[26]
***** Degradation[edit] *****
Multicellular organisms replace worn-out cells through cell division. In some
animals, however, cell division eventually halts. In humans this occurs, on
average, after 52 divisions, known as the Hayflick_limit. The cell is then
referred to as senescent. With each division the cells telomeres, protective
sequences of DNA on the end of a chromosome that prevent degradation of the
chromosomal DNA, shorten. This shortening has been correlated to negative
effects such as age related diseases and shortened lifespans in humans.[27][28]
Cancer cells, on the other hand, are not thought to degrade in this way, if at
all. An enzyme complex called telomerase, present in large quantities in
cancerous cells, rebuilds the telomeres through synthesis of telomeric DNA
repeats, allowing division to continue indefinitely.[29]
***** History[edit] *****
Kurt Michel with his phase-contrast microscope
A cell division under microscope was first discovered by German botanist Hugo
von_Mohl in 1835 as he worked over the green_alga Cladophora glomerata.[30]
In 1943, cell division was filmed for the first time[31] by Kurt_Michel using a
phase-contrast_microscope.[32]
