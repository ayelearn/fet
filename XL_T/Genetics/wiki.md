Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes, genetic
variation, and heredity in organisms.[1][2][3]
Though heredity had been observed for millennia, Gregor_Mendel, a scientist and
Augustinian friar working in the 19th century, was the first to study genetics
scientifically. Mendel studied "trait inheritance", patterns in the way traits
are handed down from parents to offspring. He observed that organisms (pea
plants) inherit traits by way of discrete "units of inheritance". This term,
still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as
a gene.
Trait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still
primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has
expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes.
Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the
context of the cell, the organism (e.g. dominance), and within the context of a
population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including
epigenetics and population_genetics. Organisms studied within the broad field
span the domains of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya).
Genetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and
experiences to influence development and behavior, often referred to as nature
versus_nurture. The intracellular or extracellular environment of a cell or
organism may switch gene transcription on or off. A classic example is two
seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one
in an arid climate. While the average height of the two corn stalks may be
genetically determined to be equal, the one in the arid_climate only grows to
half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and
nutrients in its environment.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word genetics stems from the ancient_Greek Î³ÎµÎ½ÎµÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ genetikos
meaning "genitive"/"generative", which in turn derives from Î³Î­Î½ÎµÏÎ¹Ï
genesis meaning "origin".[4][5][6]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_genetics
The observation that living things inherit traits from their parents has been
used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through
selective_breeding.[7] The modern science of genetics, seeking to understand
this process, began with the work of the Augustinian friar Gregor_Mendel in the
mid-19th century.[8]
Prior to Mendel, Imre_Festetics, a Hungarian noble, who lived in KÅszeg before
Mendel, was the first who used the word "genetics." He described several rules
of genetic inheritance in his work The genetic law of the Nature (Die
genetische GesÃ¤tze der Natur, 1819). His second law is the same as what Mendel
published. In his third law, he developed the basic principles of mutation (he
can be considered a forerunner of Hugo_de_Vries).[9]
Blending_inheritance leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which
as the engineer Fleeming_Jenkin pointed out, makes evolution by natural
selection impossible.
Other theories of inheritance preceded Mendel's work. A popular theory during
the 19th century, and implied by Charles_Darwin's 1859 On_the_Origin_of
Species, was blending_inheritance: the idea that individuals inherit a smooth
blend of traits from their parents.[10] Mendel's work provided examples where
traits were definitely not blended after hybridization, showing that traits are
produced by combinations of distinct genes rather than a continuous blend.
Blending of traits in the progeny is now explained by the action of multiple
genes with quantitative_effects. Another theory that had some support at that
time was the inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics: the belief that
individuals inherit traits strengthened by their parents. This theory (commonly
associated with Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck) is now known to be wrongâthe
experiences of individuals do not affect the genes they pass to their children,
[11] although evidence in the field of epigenetics has revived some aspects of
Lamarck's theory.[12] Other theories included the pangenesis of Charles_Darwin
(which had both acquired and inherited aspects) and Francis_Galton's
reformulation of pangenesis as both particulate and inherited.[13]
**** Mendelian and classical genetics[edit] ****
Morgan's observation of sex-linked_inheritance of a mutation causing white eyes
in Drosophila led him to the hypothesis that genes are located upon
chromosomes.
Further information: Mutationism and Modern_synthesis_(20th_century)
Modern genetics started with Mendel's studies of the nature of inheritance in
plants. In his paper "Versuche Ã¼ber Pflanzenhybriden" ("Experiments_on_Plant
Hybridization"), presented in 1865 to the Naturforschender Verein (Society for
Research in Nature) in BrÃ¼nn, Mendel traced the inheritance patterns of
certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically.[14] Although
this pattern of inheritance could only be observed for a few traits, Mendel's
work suggested that heredity was particulate, not acquired, and that the
inheritance patterns of many traits could be explained through simple rules and
ratios.
The importance of Mendel's work did not gain wide understanding until 1900,
after his death, when Hugo_de_Vries and other scientists rediscovered his
research. William_Bateson, a proponent of Mendel's work, coined the word
genetics in 1905[15][16] (the adjective genetic, derived from the Greek word
genesisâÎ³Î­Î½ÎµÏÎ¹Ï, "origin", predates the noun and was first used in a
biological sense in 1860[17]). Bateson both acted as a mentor and was aided
significantly by the work of other scientists from Newnham College at
Cambridge, specifically the work of Becky_Saunders, Nora_Darwin_Barlow, and
Muriel_Wheldale_Onslow.[18] Bateson popularized the usage of the word genetics
to describe the study of inheritance in his inaugural address to the Third
International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in 1906.[19]
After the rediscovery of Mendel's work, scientists tried to determine which
molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance. In 1911, Thomas_Hunt
Morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes, based on observations of a sex-
linked white_eye mutation in fruit_flies.[20] In 1913, his student Alfred
Sturtevant used the phenomenon of genetic_linkage to show that genes are
arranged linearly on the chromosome.[21]
**** Molecular genetics[edit] ****
DNA, the molecular basis for biological_inheritance. Each strand of DNA is a
chain of nucleotides, matching each other in the center to form what look like
rungs on a twisted ladder.
Although genes were known to exist on chromosomes, chromosomes are composed of
both protein and DNA, and scientists did not know which of the two is
responsible for inheritance. In 1928, Frederick_Griffith discovered the
phenomenon of transformation (see Griffith's_experiment): dead bacteria could
transfer genetic_material to "transform" other still-living bacteria. Sixteen
years later, in 1944, the AveryâMacLeodâMcCarty_experiment identified DNA
as the molecule responsible for transformation.[22] The role of the nucleus as
the repository of genetic information in eukaryotes had been established by
HÃ¤mmerling in 1943 in his work on the single celled alga Acetabularia.[23] The
HersheyâChase_experiment in 1952 confirmed that DNA (rather than protein) is
the genetic material of the viruses that infect bacteria, providing further
evidence that DNA is the molecule responsible for inheritance.[24]
James_Watson and Francis_Crick determined the structure of DNA in 1953, using
the X-ray_crystallography work of Rosalind_Franklin and Maurice_Wilkins that
indicated DNA has a helical structure (i.e., shaped like a corkscrew).[25][26]
Their double-helix model had two strands of DNA with the nucleotides pointing
inward, each matching a complementary nucleotide on the other strand to form
what look like rungs on a twisted ladder.[27] This structure showed that
genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of
DNA. The structure also suggested a simple method for replication: if the
strands are separated, new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based
on the sequence of the old strand. This property is what gives DNA its semi-
conservative nature where one strand of new DNA is from an original parent
strand.[28]
Although the structure of DNA showed how inheritance works, it was still not
known how DNA influences the behavior of cells. In the following years,
scientists tried to understand how DNA controls the process of protein
production.[29] It was discovered that the cell uses DNA as a template to
create matching messenger_RNA, molecules with nucleotides very similar to DNA.
The nucleotide sequence of a messenger RNA is used to create an amino_acid
sequence in protein; this translation between nucleotide sequences and amino
acid sequences is known as the genetic_code.[30]
With the newfound molecular understanding of inheritance came an explosion of
research.[31] A notable theory arose from Tomoko_Ohta in 1973 with her
amendment to the neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution through publishing the
nearly_neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution. In this theory, Ohta stressed the
importance of natural selection and the environment to the rate at which
genetic evolution occurs.[32] One important development was chain-termination
DNA_sequencing in 1977 by Frederick_Sanger. This technology allows scientists
to read the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule.[33] In 1983, Kary_Banks
Mullis developed the polymerase_chain_reaction, providing a quick way to
isolate and amplify a specific section of DNA from a mixture.[34] The efforts
of the Human_Genome_Project, Department of Energy, NIH, and parallel private
efforts by Celera_Genomics led to the sequencing of the human_genome in 2003.

***** Features of inheritance[edit] *****
**** Discrete inheritance and Mendel's laws[edit] ****
Main article: Mendelian_inheritance
A Punnett_square depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for
purple (B) and white (b) blossoms.
At its most fundamental level, inheritance in organisms occurs by passing
discrete heritable units, called genes, from parents to offspring.[37] This
property was first observed by Gregor_Mendel, who studied the segregation of
heritable traits in pea plants.[14][38] In his experiments studying the trait
for flower color, Mendel observed that the flowers of each pea plant were
either purple or whiteâbut never an intermediate between the two colors.
These different, discrete versions of the same gene are called alleles.
In the case of the pea, which is a diploid species, each individual plant has
two copies of each gene, one copy inherited from each parent.[39] Many species,
including humans, have this pattern of inheritance. Diploid organisms with two
copies of the same allele of a given gene are called homozygous at that gene
locus, while organisms with two different alleles of a given gene are called
heterozygous.
The set of alleles for a given organism is called its genotype, while the
observable traits of the organism are called its phenotype. When organisms are
heterozygous at a gene, often one allele is called dominant as its qualities
dominate the phenotype of the organism, while the other allele is called
recessive as its qualities recede and are not observed. Some alleles do not
have complete dominance and instead have incomplete_dominance by expressing an
intermediate phenotype, or codominance by expressing both alleles at once.[40]
When a pair of organisms reproduce_sexually, their offspring randomly inherit
one of the two alleles from each parent. These observations of discrete
inheritance and the segregation of alleles are collectively known as Mendel's
first_law or the Law of Segregation.
**** Notation and diagrams[edit] ****
Genetic pedigree charts help track the inheritance patterns of traits.
Geneticists use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance. A gene is
represented by one or a few letters. Often a "+" symbol is used to mark the
usual, non-mutant_allele for a gene.[41]
In fertilization and breeding experiments (and especially when discussing
Mendel's laws) the parents are referred to as the "P" generation and the
offspring as the "F1" (first filial) generation. When the F1 offspring mate
with each other, the offspring are called the "F2" (second filial) generation.
One of the common diagrams used to predict the result of cross-breeding is the
Punnett_square.
When studying human genetic diseases, geneticists often use pedigree_charts to
represent the inheritance of traits.[42] These charts map the inheritance of a
trait in a family tree.
**** Multiple gene interactions[edit] ****
Human height is a trait with complex genetic causes. Francis_Galton's data from
1889 shows the relationship between offspring height as a function of mean
parent height.
Organisms have thousands of genes, and in sexually reproducing organisms these
genes generally assort independently of each other. This means that the
inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the
inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers. This phenomenon, known as
"Mendel's_second_law" or the "law of independent assortment," means that the
alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with
many different combinations. (Some genes do not assort independently,
demonstrating genetic_linkage, a topic discussed later in this article.)
Often different genes can interact in a way that influences the same trait. In
the Blue-eyed_Mary (Omphalodes verna), for example, there exists a gene with
alleles that determine the color of flowers: blue or magenta. Another gene,
however, controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white. When a
plant has two copies of this white allele, its flowers are whiteâregardless
of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles. This interaction between
genes is called epistasis, with the second gene epistatic to the first.[43]
Many traits are not discrete features (e.g. purple or white flowers) but are
instead continuous features (e.g. human height and skin_color). These complex
traits are products of many genes.[44] The influence of these genes is
mediated, to varying degrees, by the environment an organism has experienced.
The degree to which an organism's genes contribute to a complex trait is called
heritability.[45] Measurement of the heritability of a trait is relativeâin a
more variable environment, the environment has a bigger influence on the total
variation of the trait. For example, human height is a trait with complex
causes. It has a heritability of 89% in the United States. In Nigeria, however,
where people experience a more variable access to good nutrition and health
care, height has a heritability of only 62%.[46]
***** Molecular basis for inheritance[edit] *****
**** DNA and chromosomes[edit] ****
Main articles: DNA and Chromosome
The molecular_structure of DNA. Bases pair through the arrangement of hydrogen
bonding between the strands.
The molecular basis for genes is deoxyribonucleic_acid (DNA). DNA is composed
of a chain of nucleotides, of which there are four types: adenine (A), cytosine
(C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Genetic information exists in the sequence
of these nucleotides, and genes exist as stretches of sequence along the DNA
chain.[47] Viruses are the only exception to this ruleâsometimes viruses use
the very similar molecule RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material.[48]
Viruses cannot reproduce without a host and are unaffected by many genetic
processes, so tend not to be considered living organisms.
DNA normally exists as a double-stranded molecule, coiled into the shape of a
double_helix. Each nucleotide in DNA preferentially pairs with its partner
nucleotide on the opposite strand: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Thus, in
its two-stranded form, each strand effectively contains all necessary
information, redundant with its partner strand. This structure of DNA is the
physical basis for inheritance: DNA_replication duplicates the genetic
information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for
synthesis of a new partner strand.[49]
Genes are arranged linearly along long chains of DNA base-pair sequences. In
bacteria, each cell usually contains a single circular genophore, while
eukaryotic organisms (such as plants and animals) have their DNA arranged in
multiple linear chromosomes. These DNA strands are often extremely long; the
largest human chromosome, for example, is about 247 million base_pairs in
length.[50] The DNA of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that
organize, compact, and control access to the DNA, forming a material called
chromatin; in eukaryotes, chromatin is usually composed of nucleosomes,
segments of DNA wound around cores of histone proteins.[51] The full set of
hereditary material in an organism (usually the combined DNA sequences of all
chromosomes) is called the genome.
While haploid organisms have only one copy of each chromosome, most animals and
many plants are diploid, containing two of each chromosome and thus two copies
of every gene.[39] The two alleles for a gene are located on identical loci of
the two homologous_chromosomes, each allele inherited from a different parent.
Walther_Flemming's 1882 diagram of eukaryotic cell division. Chromosomes are
copied, condensed, and organized. Then, as the cell divides, chromosome copies
separate into the daughter cells.
Many species have so-called sex_chromosomes that determine the gender of each
organism.[52] In humans and many other animals, the Y_chromosome contains the
gene that triggers the development of the specifically male characteristics. In
evolution, this chromosome has lost most of its content and also most of its
genes, while the X_chromosome is similar to the other chromosomes and contains
many genes. The X and Y chromosomes form a strongly heterogeneous pair.
**** Reproduction[edit] ****
Main articles: Asexual_reproduction and Sexual_reproduction
When cells divide, their full genome is copied and each daughter_cell inherits
one copy. This process, called mitosis, is the simplest form of reproduction
and is the basis for asexual_reproduction. Asexual reproduction can also occur
in multicellular organisms, producing offspring that inherit their genome from
a single parent. Offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are
called clones.
Eukaryotic organisms often use sexual_reproduction to generate offspring that
contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents. The
process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single
copies of the genome (haploid) and double copies (diploid).[39] Haploid cells
fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired
chromosomes. Diploid organisms form haploids by dividing, without replicating
their DNA, to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of
chromosomes. Most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their
lifespan, with the haploid form reduced to single cell gametes such as sperm or
eggs.
Although they do not use the haploid/diploid method of sexual reproduction,
bacteria have many methods of acquiring new genetic information. Some bacteria
can undergo conjugation, transferring a small circular piece of DNA to another
bacterium.[53] Bacteria can also take up raw DNA fragments found in the
environment and integrate them into their genomes, a phenomenon known as
transformation.[54] These processes result in horizontal_gene_transfer,
transmitting fragments of genetic information between organisms that would be
otherwise unrelated.
**** Recombination and genetic linkage[edit] ****
Main articles: Chromosomal_crossover and Genetic_linkage
Thomas_Hunt_Morgan's 1916 illustration of a double crossover between
chromosomes.
The diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to
assort_independently or be separated from their homologous pair during sexual
reproduction wherein haploid gametes are formed. In this way new combinations
of genes can occur in the offspring of a mating pair. Genes on the same
chromosome would theoretically never recombine. However, they do, via the
cellular process of chromosomal_crossover. During crossover, chromosomes
exchange stretches of DNA, effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the
chromosomes.[55] This process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during
meiosis, a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells.
The first cytological demonstration of crossing over was performed by Harriet
Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931. Their research and experiments on
corn provided cytological evidence for the genetic theory that linked genes on
paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog to the other.
[56]
The probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on
the chromosome is related to the distance between the points. For an
arbitrarily long distance, the probability of crossover is high enough that the
inheritance of the genes is effectively uncorrelated.[57] For genes that are
closer together, however, the lower probability of crossover means that the
genes demonstrate genetic_linkage; alleles for the two genes tend to be
inherited together. The amounts of linkage between a series of genes can be
combined to form a linear linkage_map that roughly describes the arrangement of
the genes along the chromosome.[58]
***** Gene expression[edit] *****
**** Genetic code[edit] ****
Main article: Genetic_code
The genetic_code: Using a triplet_code, DNA, through a messenger_RNA
intermediary, specifies a protein.
Genes generally express their functional effect through the production of
proteins, which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in the
cell. Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains, each of which is
composed of a sequence of amino_acids, and the DNA sequence of a gene (through
an RNA intermediate) is used to produce a specific amino_acid_sequence. This
process begins with the production of an RNA molecule with a sequence matching
the gene's DNA sequence, a process called transcription.
This messenger_RNA molecule is then used to produce a corresponding amino acid
sequence through a process called translation. Each group of three nucleotides
in the sequence, called a codon, corresponds either to one of the twenty
possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction_to_end_the_amino_acid
sequence; this correspondence is called the genetic_code.[59] The flow of
information is unidirectional: information is transferred from nucleotide
sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins, but it never transfers from
protein back into the sequence of DNAâa phenomenon Francis_Crick called the
central_dogma_of_molecular_biology.[60]
The specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three-dimensional
structure for that protein, and the three-dimensional structures of proteins
are related to their functions.[61][62] Some are simple structural molecules,
like the fibers formed by the protein collagen. Proteins can bind to other
proteins and simple molecules, sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating
chemical_reactions within the bound molecules (without changing the structure
of the protein itself). Protein structure is dynamic; the protein hemoglobin
bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture, transport,
and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood.
A single_nucleotide_difference within DNA can cause a change in the amino acid
sequence of a protein. Because protein structures are the result of their amino
acid sequences, some changes can dramatically change the properties of a
protein by destabilizing the structure or changing the surface of the protein
in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules. For
example, sickle-cell_anemia is a human genetic_disease that results from a
single base difference within the coding_region for the Î²-globin section of
hemoglobin, causing a single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin's
physical properties.[63] Sickle-cell versions of hemoglobin stick to
themselves, stacking to form fibers that distort the shape of red_blood_cells
carrying the protein. These sickle-shaped cells no longer flow smoothly through
blood_vessels, having a tendency to clog or degrade, causing the medical
problems associated with this disease.
Some DNA sequences are transcribed into RNA but are not translated into protein
productsâsuch RNA molecules are called non-coding_RNA. In some cases, these
products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions
(e.g. ribosomal_RNA and transfer_RNA). RNA can also have regulatory effects
through hybridization interactions with other RNA molecules (e.g. microRNA).
**** Nature and nurture[edit] ****
Main article: Nature_and_nurture
Siamese_cats have a temperature-sensitive pigment-production mutation.
Although genes contain all the information an organism uses to function, the
environment plays an important role in determining the ultimate phenotypes an
organism displays. The phrase "nature_and_nurture" refers to this complementary
relationship. The phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genes
and the environment. An interesting example is the coat coloration of the
Siamese_cat. In this case, the body temperature of the cat plays the role of
the environment. The cat's genes code for dark hair, thus the hair-producing
cells in the cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair. But these dark
hair-producing proteins are sensitive to temperature (i.e. have a mutation
causing temperature-sensitivity) and denature in higher-temperature
environments, failing to produce dark-hair pigment in areas where the cat has a
higher body temperature. In a low-temperature environment, however, the
protein's structure is stable and produces dark-hair pigment normally. The
protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colderâsuch as its legs,
ears, tail and faceâso the cat has dark hair at its extremities.[64]
Environment plays a major role in effects of the human genetic disease
phenylketonuria.[65] The mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts the
ability of the body to break down the amino acid phenylalanine, causing a toxic
build-up of an intermediate molecule that, in turn, causes severe symptoms of
progressive intellectual disability and seizures. However, if someone with the
phenylketonuria mutation follows a strict diet that avoids this amino acid,
they remain normal and healthy.
A common method for determining how genes and environment ("nature and
nurture") contribute to a phenotype involves studying_identical_and_fraternal
twins, or other siblings of multiple_births.[66] Identical siblings are
genetically the same since they come from the same zygote. Meanwhile, fraternal
twins are as genetically different from one another as normal siblings. By
comparing how often a certain disorder occurs in a pair of identical twins to
how often it occurs in a pair of fraternal twins, scientists can determine
whether that disorder is caused by genetic or postnatal environmental factors.
One famous example involved the study of the Genain_quadruplets, who were
identical_quadruplets all diagnosed with schizophrenia.[67] However, such tests
cannot separate genetic factors from environmental factors affecting fetal
development.
**** Gene regulation[edit] ****
Main article: Regulation_of_gene_expression
The genome of a given organism contains thousands of genes, but not all these
genes need to be active at any given moment. A gene is expressed when it is
being transcribed into mRNA and there exist many cellular methods of
controlling the expression of genes such that proteins are produced only when
needed by the cell. Transcription_factors are regulatory proteins that bind to
DNA, either promoting or inhibiting the transcription of a gene.[68] Within the
genome of Escherichia_coli bacteria, for example, there exists a series of
genes necessary for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. However, when
tryptophan is already available to the cell, these genes for tryptophan
synthesis are no longer needed. The presence of tryptophan directly affects the
activity of the genesâtryptophan molecules bind to the tryptophan_repressor
(a transcription factor), changing the repressor's structure such that the
repressor binds to the genes. The tryptophan repressor blocks the transcription
and expression of the genes, thereby creating negative_feedback regulation of
the tryptophan synthesis process.[69]
Transcription factors bind to DNA, influencing the transcription of associated
genes.
Differences in gene expression are especially clear within multicellular
organisms, where cells all contain the same genome but have very different
structures and behaviors due to the expression of different sets of genes. All
the cells in a multicellular organism derive from a single cell,
differentiating into variant cell types in response to external and
intercellular_signals and gradually establishing different patterns of gene
expression to create different behaviors. As no single gene is responsible for
the development of structures within multicellular organisms, these patterns
arise from the complex interactions between many cells.
Within eukaryotes, there exist structural features of chromatin that influence
the transcription of genes, often in the form of modifications to DNA and
chromatin that are stably inherited by daughter cells.[70] These features are
called "epigenetic" because they exist "on top" of the DNA sequence and retain
inheritance from one cell generation to the next. Because of epigenetic
features, different cell types grown within the same medium can retain very
different properties. Although epigenetic features are generally dynamic over
the course of development, some, like the phenomenon of paramutation, have
multigenerational inheritance and exist as rare exceptions to the general rule
of DNA as the basis for inheritance.[71]
***** Genetic change[edit] *****
**** Mutations[edit] ****
Main article: Mutation
Gene duplication allows diversification by providing redundancy: one gene can
mutate and lose its original function without harming the organism.
During the process of DNA_replication, errors occasionally occur in the
polymerization of the second strand. These errors, called mutations, can affect
the phenotype of an organism, especially if they occur within the protein
coding sequence of a gene. Error rates are usually very lowâ1 error in every
10â100 million basesâdue to the "proofreading" ability of DNA_polymerases.
[72][73] Processes that increase the rate of changes in DNA are called
mutagenic: mutagenic chemicals promote errors in DNA replication, often by
interfering with the structure of base-pairing, while UV_radiation induces
mutations by causing damage to the DNA structure.[74] Chemical damage to DNA
occurs naturally as well and cells use DNA_repair mechanisms to repair
mismatches and breaks. The repair does not, however, always restore the
original sequence.
In organisms that use chromosomal_crossover to exchange DNA and recombine
genes, errors in alignment during meiosis can also cause mutations.[75] Errors
in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner
chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment; this makes some regions in genomes
more prone to mutating in this way. These errors create large structural
changes in DNA sequence – duplications, inversions, deletions of entire
regions – or the accidental exchange of whole parts of sequences between
different chromosomes (chromosomal_translocation).
This is a diagram showing mutations in an RNA sequence. Figure (1) is a normal
RNA sequence, consisting of 4 codons. Figure (2) shows a missense, single
point, non silent mutation. Figures (3 and 4) both show frameshift_mutations,
which is why they are grouped together. Figure 3 shows a deletion of the second
base pair in the second codon. Figure 4 shows an insertion in the third base
pair of the second codon. Figure (5) shows a repeat expansion, where an entire
codon is duplicated.
**** Natural selection and evolution[edit] ****
Main article: Evolution
Further information: Natural_selection
Mutations alter an organism's genotype and occasionally this causes different
phenotypes to appear. Most mutations have little effect on an organism's
phenotype, health, or reproductive fitness.[76] Mutations that do have an
effect are usually detrimental, but occasionally some can be beneficial.[77]
Studies in the fly Drosophila_melanogaster suggest that if a mutation changes a
protein produced by a gene, about 70 percent of these mutations will be harmful
with the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.[78]
An evolutionary_tree of eukaryotic organisms, constructed by the comparison of
several orthologous_gene sequences.
Population_genetics studies the distribution of genetic differences within
populations and how these distributions change over time.[79] Changes in the
frequency_of_an_allele in a population are mainly influenced by natural
selection, where a given allele provides a selective or reproductive advantage
to the organism,[80] as well as other factors such as mutation, genetic_drift,
genetic_hitchhiking,[81] artificial_selection and migration.[82]
Over many generations, the genomes of organisms can change significantly,
resulting in evolution. In the process called adaptation, selection for
beneficial mutations can cause a species to evolve into forms better able to
survive in their environment.[83] New species are formed through the process of
speciation, often caused by geographical separations that prevent populations
from exchanging genes with each other.[84]
By comparing the homology between different species' genomes, it is possible to
calculate the evolutionary distance between them and when_they_may_have
diverged. Genetic comparisons are generally considered a more accurate method
of characterizing the relatedness between species than the comparison of
phenotypic characteristics. The evolutionary distances between species can be
used to form evolutionary_trees; these trees represent the common_descent and
divergence of species over time, although they do not show the transfer of
genetic material between unrelated species (known as horizontal_gene_transfer
and most common in bacteria).[85]
**** Model organisms[edit] ****
The common_fruit_fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a popular model_organism in
genetics research.
Although geneticists originally studied inheritance in a wide range of
organisms, researchers began to specialize in studying the genetics of a
particular subset of organisms. The fact that significant research already
existed for a given organism would encourage new researchers to choose it for
further study, and so eventually a few model_organisms became the basis for
most genetics research.[86] Common research topics in model organism genetics
include the study of gene_regulation and the involvement of genes in
development and cancer.
Organisms were chosen, in part, for convenienceâshort generation times and
easy genetic_manipulation made some organisms popular genetics research tools.
Widely used model organisms include the gut bacterium Escherichia_coli, the
plant Arabidopsis_thaliana, baker's yeast (Saccharomyces_cerevisiae), the
nematode Caenorhabditis_elegans, the common fruit fly (Drosophila
melanogaster), and the common house mouse (Mus_musculus).
**** Medicine[edit] ****
Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular_biology.
Medical_genetics seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human
health and disease.[87] When searching for an unknown gene that may be involved
in a disease, researchers commonly use genetic_linkage and genetic pedigree
charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease. At the
population level, researchers take advantage of Mendelian_randomization to look
for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases, a method
especially useful for multigenic_traits not clearly defined by a single gene.
[88] Once a candidate gene is found, further research is often done on the
corresponding (or homologous) genes of model organisms. In addition to studying
genetic diseases, the increased availability of genotyping methods has led to
the field of pharmacogenetics: the study of how genotype can affect drug
responses.[89]
Individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop cancer,[90] and
cancer is a genetic disease.[91] The process of cancer development in the body
is a combination of events. Mutations occasionally occur within cells in the
body as they divide. Although these mutations will not be inherited by any
offspring, they can affect the behavior of cells, sometimes causing them to
grow and divide more frequently. There are biological mechanisms that attempt
to stop this process; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that
should trigger cell_death, but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause
cells to ignore these messages. An internal process of natural_selection occurs
within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote
their own growth, creating a cancerous tumor that grows and invades various
tissues of the body.
Normally, a cell divides only in response to signals called growth_factors and
stops_growing_once_in_contact_with_surrounding_cells and in response to growth-
inhibitory signals. It usually then divides a limited number of times and dies,
staying within the epithelium where it is unable to migrate to other organs. To
become a cancer cell, a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes
(three to seven). A cancer cell can divide without growth factor and ignores
inhibitory signals. Also, it is immortal and can grow indefinitely, even after
it makes contact with neighboring cells. It may escape from the epithelium and
ultimately from the primary_tumor. Then, the escaped cell can cross the
endothelium of a blood vessel and get transported by the bloodstream to
colonize a new organ, forming deadly metastasis. Although there are some
genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers, the major fraction is
due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in
one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not
transmitted to the progeny (somatic_mutations). The most frequent mutations are
a loss of function of p53_protein, a tumor_suppressor, or in the p53 pathway,
and gain of function mutations in the Ras_proteins, or in other oncogenes.
**** Research methods[edit] ****
Colonies of E._coli produced by cellular_cloning. A similar methodology is
often used in molecular_cloning.
DNA can be manipulated in the laboratory. Restriction_enzymes are commonly used
enzymes that cut DNA at specific sequences, producing predictable fragments of
DNA.[92] DNA fragments can be visualized through use of gel_electrophoresis,
which separates fragments according to their length.
The use of ligation_enzymes allows DNA fragments to be connected. By binding
("ligating") fragments of DNA together from different sources, researchers can
create recombinant_DNA, the DNA often associated with genetically_modified
organisms. Recombinant DNA is commonly used in the context of plasmids: short
circular DNA molecules with a few genes on them. In the process known as
molecular_cloning, researchers can amplify the DNA fragments by inserting
plasmids into bacteria and then culturing them on plates of agar (to isolate
clones_of_bacteria_cellsâ"cloning" can also refer to the various means of
creating cloned ("clonal") organisms).
DNA can also be amplified using a procedure called the polymerase_chain
reaction (PCR).[93] By using specific short sequences of DNA, PCR can isolate
and exponentially amplify a targeted region of DNA. Because it can amplify from
extremely small amounts of DNA, PCR is also often used to detect the presence
of specific DNA sequences.
**** DNA sequencing and genomics[edit] ****
DNA_sequencing, one of the most fundamental technologies developed to study
genetics, allows researchers to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA
fragments. The technique of chain-termination_sequencing, developed in 1977 by
a team led by Frederick_Sanger, is still routinely used to sequence DNA
fragments.[94] Using this technology, researchers have been able to study the
molecular sequences associated with many human diseases.
As sequencing has become less expensive, researchers have sequenced_the_genomes
of many organisms using a process called genome_assembly, which utilizes
computational tools to stitch together sequences from many different fragments.
[95] These technologies were used to sequence the human_genome in the Human
Genome_Project completed in 2003.[35] New high-throughput_sequencing
technologies are dramatically lowering the cost of DNA sequencing, with many
researchers hoping to bring the cost of resequencing a human genome down to a
thousand dollars.[96]
Next-generation_sequencing (or high-throughput sequencing) came about due to
the ever-increasing demand for low-cost sequencing. These sequencing
technologies allow the production of potentially millions of sequences
concurrently.[97][98] The large amount of sequence data available has created
the field of genomics, research that uses computational tools to search for and
analyze patterns in the full genomes of organisms. Genomics can also be
considered a subfield of bioinformatics, which uses computational approaches to
analyze large sets of biological_data. A common problem to these fields of
research is how to manage and share data that deals with human subject and
personally_identifiable_information. See also genomics_data_sharing.
***** Society and culture[edit] *****

On 19 March 2015, a group of leading biologists urged a worldwide ban on
clinical use of methods, particularly the use of CRISPR and zinc_finger, to
edit the human_genome in a way that can be inherited.[99][100][101][102] In
April 2015, Chinese researchers reported results of basic_research to edit the
DNA of non-viable human_embryos using CRISPR.[103][104]
