Transmission of genes occurring outside the nucleus
Extranuclear inheritance or cytoplasmic inheritance is the transmission of
genes that occur outside the nucleus. It is found in most eukaryotes and is
commonly known to occur in cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and
chloroplasts or from cellular parasites like viruses or bacteria.[1][2][3]

***** Organelles[edit] *****
Mitochondria contain their own DNA. They are passed on by mothers to their
children via the cytoplasm of the egg.
Mitochondria are organelles which function to transform energy as a result of
cellular_respiration. Chloroplasts are organelles which function to produce
sugars via photosynthesis in plants and algae. The genes located in
mitochondria and chloroplasts are very important for proper cellular function,
yet the genomes replicate independently of the DNA located in the nucleus,
which is typically arranged in chromosomes that only replicate one time
preceding cellular division. The extranuclear genomes of mitochondria and
chloroplasts however replicate independently of cell division. They replicate
in response to a cell's increasing energy needs which adjust during that cell's
lifespan. Since they replicate independently, genomic recombination of these
genomes is rarely found in offspring, contrary to nuclear genomes in which
recombination is common. Mitochondrial diseases are inherited from the mother,
not from the father: mitochondria with their mitochondrial DNA from the
mother's egg cell are incorporated into the zygote and passed to daughter
cells, whereas those from the sperm are not.
***** Parasites[edit] *****
Extranuclear transmission of viral genomes and symbiotic bacteria is also
possible. An example of viral genome transmission is perinatal transmission.
This occurs from mother to fetus during the perinatal period, which begins
before birth and ends about 1 month after birth. During this time viral
material may be passed from mother to child in the bloodstream or breastmilk.
This is of particular concern with mothers carrying HIV or Hepatitis_C viruses.
[2][3] Symbiotic cytoplasmic bacteria are also inherited in organisms such as
insects and protists.[4]
***** Types[edit] *****
Three general types of extranuclear inheritance exist.
    * Vegetative segregation results from random replication and partitioning
      of cytoplasmic organelles. It occurs with chloroplasts and mitochondria
      during mitotic cell divisions and results in daughter cells that contain
      a random sample of the parent cell's organelles. An example of vegetative
      segregation is with mitochondria of asexually replicating yeast cells.[5]
    * Uniparental inheritance occurs in extranuclear genes when only one parent
      contributes organellar DNA to the offspring. A classic example of
      uniparental gene transmission is the maternal_inheritance of human
      mitochondria. The mother's mitochondria are transmitted to the offspring
      at fertilization via the egg. The father's mitochondrial genes are not
      transmitted to the offspring via the sperm. Very rare cases which require
      further investigation have been reported of paternal mitochondrial
      inheritance in humans, in which the father's mitochondrial genome is
      found in offspring.[6] Chloroplast genes can also inherit uniparentally
      during sexual_reproduction. They are historically thought to inherit
      maternally, but paternal inheritance in many species is increasingly
      being identified. The mechanisms of uniparental inheritance from species
      to species differ greatly and are quite complicated. For instance,
      chloroplasts have been found to exhibit maternal, paternal and biparental
      modes even within the same species.[7][8]
    * Biparental inheritance occurs in extranuclear genes when both parents
      contribute organellar DNA to the offspring. It may be less common than
      uniparental extranuclear inheritance, and usually occurs in a permissible
      species only a fraction of the time. An example of biparental
      mitochondrial inheritance is in the yeast Saccharomyces_cerevisiae. When
      two haploid cells of opposite mating type fuse they can both contribute
      mitochondria to the resulting diploid offspring.[1][5]
***** Mutant mitochondria[edit] *****
Poky is a mutant of the fungus Neurospora_crassa that has extranuclear
inheritance. Poky is characterized by slow growth, a defect in mitochondrial
ribosome assembly and deficiencies in several cytochromes.[9] The studies of
poky mutants were among the first to establish an extranuclear mitochondrial
basis for inheritance of a particular genotype. It was initially found, using
genetic crosses, that poky is maternally inherited.[10] Subsequently, the
primary defect in the poky mutants was determined to be a deletion in the
mitochondrial DNA sequence encoding the small subunit of mitochondrial
ribosomal_RNA.[11]
