From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
An organism's active control of the osmotic pressure of its fluids to maintain
homeostasis
Osmoregulation is the active regulation of the osmotic_pressure of an
organism's body_fluids, detected by osmoreceptors, to maintain the homeostasis
of the organism's water content; that is, it maintains the fluid_balance and
the concentration of electrolytes (salts in solution which in this case is
represented by body fluid) to keep the body fluids from becoming too diluted or
concentrated. Osmotic pressure is a measure of the tendency of water to move
into one solution from another by osmosis.[1] The higher the osmotic pressure
of a solution, the more water tends to move into it. Pressure must be exerted
on the hypertonic side of a selectively permeable membrane to prevent diffusion
of water by osmosis from the side containing pure water.
Organisms in aquatic and terrestrial environments must maintain the right
concentration of solutes and amount of water in their body fluids; this
involves excretion (getting rid of metabolic_nitrogen_wastes and other
substances such as hormones that would be toxic if allowed to accumulate in the
blood) through organs such as the skin and the kidneys.

***** Regulators and conformers[edit] *****
Movement of water and ions in freshwater fish
Movement of water and ions in saltwater fish
Two major types of osmoregulation are osmoconformers and osmoregulators.
Osmoconformers match their body osmolarity to their environment actively or
passively. Most marine invertebrates are osmoconformers, although their ionic
composition may be different from that of seawater.
Osmoregulators tightly regulate their body osmolarity, maintaining constant
internal conditions. They are more common in the animal kingdom. Osmoregulators
actively control salt concentrations despite the salt concentrations in the
environment. An example is freshwater fish. The gills actively_uptake salt from
the environment by the use of mitochondria-rich cells. Water will diffuse into
the fish, so it excretes a very hypotonic (dilute) urine to expel all the
excess water. A marine fish has an internal osmotic concentration lower than
that of the surrounding seawater, so it tends to lose water and gain salt. It
actively excretes salt out from the gills. Most fish are stenohaline, which
means they are restricted to either salt or fresh water and cannot survive in
water with a different salt concentration than they are adapted to. However,
some fish show a tremendous ability to effectively osmoregulate across a broad
range of salinities; fish with this ability are known as euryhaline species,
e.g., Flounder. Flounder have been observed to inhabit two utterly disparate
environments—marine and fresh water—and it is inherent to adapt to both by
bringing in behavioral and physiological modifications.
Some marine fish, like sharks, have adopted a different, efficient mechanism to
conserve water, i.e., osmoregulation. They retain urea in their blood in
relatively higher concentration. Urea damages living tissues so, to cope with
this problem, some fish retain trimethylamine_oxide. This provides a better
solution to urea's toxicity. Sharks, having slightly higher solute
concentration (i.e., above 1000 mOsm which is sea solute concentration), do not
drink water like fresh water fish.
***** In plants[edit] *****
While there are no specific osmoregulatory organs in higher plants, the stomata
are important in regulating water loss through evapotranspiration, and on the
cellular level the vacuole is crucial in regulating the concentration of
solutes in the cytoplasm. Strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures all
increase evapotranspiration from leaves. Abscisic_acid is an important hormone
in helping plants to conserve water—it causes stomata to close and stimulates
root growth so that more water can be absorbed.
Plants share with animals the problems of obtaining water but, unlike in
animals, the loss of water in plants is crucial to create a driving force to
move nutrients from the soil to tissues. Certain plants have evolved methods of
water conservation.
Xerophytes are plants that can survive in dry habitats, such as deserts, and
are able to withstand prolonged periods of water shortage. Succulent plants
such as the cacti store water in the vacuoles of large parenchyma tissues.
Other plants have leaf modifications to reduce water loss, such as needle-
shaped leaves, sunken stomata, and thick, waxy cuticles as in the pine. The
sand-dune_marram_grass has rolled leaves with stomata on the inner surface.
Hydrophytes are plants in water habitats. They mostly grow in water or in wet
or damp places. In these plants the water absorption occur through the whole
surface of the plant, e.g., the water_lily.
Halophytes are plants living in marshy areas (close to sea). They have to
absorb water from such a soil which has higher salt concentration and therefore
lower water potential(higher osmotic pressure). Halophytes cope with this
situation by activating salts in their roots. As a consequence, the cells of
the roots develop lower water potential which brings in water by osmosis. The
excess salt can be stored in cells or excreted out from salt glands on leaves.
The salt thus secreted by some species help them to trap water vapours from the
air, which is absorbed in liquid by leaf cells. Therefore, this is another way
of obtaining additional water from air, e.g., glasswort and cord-grass.
Mesophytes are plants living in lands of temperate zone, which grow in well-
watered soil. They can easily compensate the water lost by transpiration
through absorbing water from the soil. To prevent excessive transpiration they
have developed a waterproof external covering called cuticle.
***** In animals[edit] *****
Kidneys play a very large role in human osmoregulation by regulating the amount
of water reabsorbed from glomerular_filtrate in kidney tubules, which is
controlled by hormones such as antidiuretic_hormone (ADH), aldosterone, and
angiotensin_II. For example, a decrease in water_potential is detected by
osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which stimulates ADH release from the
pituitary_gland to increase the permeability of the walls of the collecting
ducts in the kidneys. Therefore, a large proportion of water is reabsorbed from
fluid in the kidneys to prevent too much water from being excreted.[citation

***** In protists[edit] *****
Protist Paramecium aurelia with contractile vacuoles.
Amoeba makes use of contractile_vacuoles to collect excretory wastes, such as
ammonia, from the intracellular fluid by diffusion and active transport. As
osmotic action pushes water from the environment into the cytoplasm, the
vacuole moves to the surface and disposes the contents into the environment.
***** In bacteria[edit] *****
Bacteria respond to osmotic stress by rapidly accumulating electrolytes or
small organic solutes via transporters whose activities are stimulated by
increases in osmolarity. The bacteria may also turn on genes encoding
transporters of osmolytes and enzymes that synthesize osmoprotectants.[2] The
EnvZ/OmpR two-component_system, which regulates the expression of porins, is
well characterized in the model_organism E._coli.[3]
***** Vertebrate excretory systems[edit] *****
**** Waste products of the nitrogen metabolism[edit] ****
Ammonia is a toxic by-product of protein metabolism and is generally converted
to less toxic substances after it is produced then excreted; mammals convert
ammonia to urea, whereas birds and reptiles form uric acid to be excreted with
other wastes via their cloacas.
**** Achieving osmoregulation in vertebrates[edit] ****
Four processes occur:
    * filtration – fluid portion of blood (plasma) is filtered from a nephron
      (functional unit of vertebrate kidney) structure known as the glomerulus
      into Bowman's_capsule or glomerular capsule (in the kidney's cortex) and
      flows down the proximal convoluted tubule to a "u-turn" called the Loop
      of_Henle (loop of the nephron) in the medulla portion of the kidney.
    * reabsorption – most of the viscous glomerular filtrate is returned to
      blood vessels that surround the convoluted tubules.
    * secretion – the remaining fluid becomes urine, which travels down
      collecting ducts to the medullary region of the kidney.
    * excretion – the urine (in mammals) is stored in the urinary bladder and
      exits via the urethra; in other vertebrates, the urine mixes with other
      wastes in the cloaca before leaving the body (frogs also have a urinary
      bladder).
