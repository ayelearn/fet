Communication (from Latin communicare, meaning "to share")[1] is the act of
conveying meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of
mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules.
The main steps inherent to all communication are:[2]
   1. The formation of communicative motivation or reason.
   2. Message composition (further internal or technical elaboration on what
      exactly to express).
   3. Message encoding (for example, into digital_data, written_text, speech,
      pictures, gestures and so on).
   4. Transmission of the encoded message as a sequence of signals using a
      specific channel or medium.
   5. Noise sources such as natural forces and in some cases human activity
      (both intentional and accidental) begin influencing the quality of
      signals propagating from the sender to one or more receivers.
   6. Reception of signals and reassembling of the encoded message from a
      sequence of received signals.
   7. Decoding of the reassembled encoded message.
   8. Interpretation and making_sense of the presumed original message.
The scientific_study of communication can be divided into:
    * Information_theory which studies the quantification, storage, and
      communication of information in general;
    * Communication_studies which concerns human communication;
    * Biosemiotics which examines communication in and between living organisms
      in general.
The channel of communication can be visual, auditory, tactile (such as in
Braille) and haptic, olfactory, electromagnetic, or biochemical.
Human communication is unique for its extensive use of abstract_language.
Development of civilization has been closely linked with progress in
telecommunication.

***** Non-verbal[edit] *****
Main article: Nonverbal_communication
Nonverbal_communication describes the processes of conveying a type of
information in the form of non-linguistic representations. Examples of
nonverbal communication include haptic_communication, chronemic_communication,
gestures, body_language, facial_expressions, eye_contact etc. Nonverbal
communication also relates to the intent of a message. Examples of intent are
voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as
involuntary, such as sweating.[3] Speech also contains nonverbal elements known
as paralanguage, e.g. rhythm, intonation, tempo, and stress. It affects
communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust. Likewise,
written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, the spatial
arrangement of words and the use of emoticons to convey emotion.
Nonverbal communication demonstrates one of Paul_Wazlawick's laws: you cannot
not communicate. Once proximity has formed awareness, living creatures begin
interpreting any signals received.[4] Some of the functions of nonverbal
communication in humans are to complement and illustrate, to reinforce and
emphasize, to replace and substitute, to control and regulate, and to
contradict the denotative message.
Nonverbal cues are heavily relied on to express communication and to interpret
others' communication and can replace or substitute verbal messages. However,
non-verbal communication is ambiguous. When verbal messages contradict non-
verbal messages, observation of non-verbal behaviour is relied on to judge
another's attitudes and feelings, rather than assuming the truth of the verbal
message alone.
There are several reasons as to why non-verbal communication plays a vital role
in communication:
"Non-verbal communication is omnipresent." [5] They are included in every
single communication act. To have total communication, all non-verbal channels
such as the body, face, voice, appearance, touch, distance, timing, and other
environmental forces must be engaged during face-to-face interaction. Written
communication can also have non-verbal attributes. E-mails and web chats allow
an individual's the option to change text font colours, stationary, emoticons,
and capitalization in order to capture non-verbal cues into a verbal medium.
"Non-verbal behaviours are multifunctional." [6] Many different non-verbal
channels are engaged at the same time in communication acts and allow the
chance for simultaneous messages to be sent and received.
"Non-verbal behaviours may form a universal language system." [6] Smiling,
crying, pointing, caressing, and glaring are non-verbal behaviours that are
used and understood by people regardless of nationality. Such non-verbal
signals allow the most basic form of communication when verbal communication is
not effective due to language barriers.
***** Verbal[edit] *****
Verbal_communication is the spoken or written conveyance of a message. Human
language can be defined as a system of symbols (sometimes known as lexemes) and
the grammars (rules) by which the symbols are manipulated. The word "language"
also refers to common properties of languages. Language_learning normally
occurs most intensively during human childhood. Most of the thousands of human
languages use patterns of sound or gesture for symbols which enable
communication with others around them. Languages tend to share certain
properties, although there are exceptions. There is no_defined_line between a
language and a dialect. Constructed_languages such as Esperanto, programming
languages, and various mathematical formalisms are not necessarily restricted
to the properties shared by human languages.
As previously mentioned, language can be characterized as symbolic. Charles
Ogden and I.A Richards developed The Triangle of Meaning model to explain the
symbol (the relationship between a word), the referent (the thing it
describes), and the meaning (the thought associated with the word and the
thing).
The properties of language are governed by rules. Language follows phonological
rules (sounds that appear in a language), syntactic rules (arrangement of words
and punctuation in a sentence), semantic rules (the agreed upon meaning of
words), and pragmatic rules (meaning derived upon context).
The meanings that are attached to words can be literal, or otherwise known as
denotative; relating to the topic being discussed, or, the meanings take
context and relationships into account, otherwise known as connotative;
relating to the feelings, history, and power dynamics of the communicators.[7]
Contrary to popular belief, signed_languages of the world (e.g., American_Sign
Language) are considered to be verbal communication because their sign
vocabulary, grammar, and other linguistic structures abide by all the necessary
classifications as spoken languages. There are however, nonverbal elements to
signed languages, such as the speed, intensity, and size of signs that are
made. A signer might sign "yes" in response to a question, or they might sign a
sarcastic-large slow yes to convey a different nonverbal meaning. The sign yes
is the verbal message while the other movements add nonverbal meaning to the
message.
***** Written communication and its historical development[edit] *****
Over time the forms of and ideas about communication have evolved through the
continuing progression of technology. Advances include communications
psychology and media psychology, an emerging field of study.
The progression of written communication can be divided into three "information
communication revolutions":[8]
   1. Written communication first emerged through the use of pictographs. The
      pictograms were made in stone, hence written communication was not yet
      mobile. Pictograms began to develop standardized and simplified forms.
   2. The next step occurred when writing began to appear on paper, papyrus,
      clay, wax, and other media with commonly shared writing systems, leading
      to adaptable alphabets. Communication became mobile.
   3. The final stage is characterized by the transfer of information through
      controlled waves of electromagnetic_radiation (i.e., radio, microwave,
      infrared) and other electronic_signals.
Communication is thus a process by which meaning is assigned and conveyed in an
attempt to create shared understanding. Gregory Bateson called it "the
replication of tautologies in the universe.[9] This process, which requires a
vast repertoire of skills in interpersonal processing, listening, observing,
speaking, questioning, analyzing, gestures, and evaluating enables
collaboration and cooperation.[10]
***** Business[edit] *****
Main article: Business_communication
Business communication is used for a wide variety of activities including, but
not limited to: strategic communications planning, media relations, public
relations (which can include social media, broadcast and written
communications, and more), brand management, reputation_management, speech-
writing, customer-client relations, and internal/employee communications.
Companies with limited resources may choose to engage in only a few of these
activities, while larger organizations may employ a full spectrum of
communications. Since it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills,
communications professionals often specialize in one or two of these areas but
usually have at least a working knowledge of most of them. By far, the most
important qualifications communications professionals can possess are excellent
writing ability, good 'people' skills, and the capacity to think critically and
strategically.
***** Political[edit] *****
Communication is one of the most relevant tools in political strategies,
including persuasion and propaganda. In mass media research and online media
research, the effort of the strategist is that of getting a precise decoding,
avoiding "message reactance", that is, message refusal. The reaction to a
message is referred also in terms of approach to a message, as follows:
    * In "radical reading" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and
      viewpoints built into the text by its makers. Effect: message refusal.
    * In "dominant reading", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and
      viewpoints built into the text by its makers. Effect: message acceptance.
    * In "subordinate reading" the audience accepts, by and large, the
      meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makers.
      Effect: obey to the message.[11]
Holistic approaches are used by communication campaign leaders and
communication strategists in order to examine all the options, "actors" and
channels that can generate change in the semiotic landscape, that is, change in
perceptions, change in credibility, change in the "memetic background", change
in the image of movements, of candidates, players and managers as perceived by
key influencers that can have a role in generating the desired "end-state".
The modern political communication field is highly influenced by the framework
and practices of "information operations" doctrines that derive their nature
from strategic and military studies. According to this view, what is really
relevant is the concept of acting on the Information Environment. The
information environment is the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and
systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This
environment consists of three interrelated dimensions, which continuously
interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are
known as physical, informational, and cognitive.[12]
***** Family[edit] *****
Family communication is the study of the communication perspective in a broadly
defined family, with intimacy and trusting relationship.[13] The main goal of
family communication is to understand the interactions of family and the
pattern of behaviors of family members in different circumstances. Open and
honest communication creates an atmosphere that allows family members to
express their differences as well as love and admiration for one another. It
also helps to understand the feelings of one another.
Family communication study looks at topics such as family rules, family roles
or family dialectics and how those factors could affect the communication
between family members. Researchers develop theories to understand
communication behaviors. Family communication study also digs deep into certain
time periods of family life such as marriage, parenthood or divorce and how
communication stands in those situations. It is important for family members to
understand communication as a trusted way which leads to a well constructed
family.
***** Interpersonal[edit] *****
Main article: Interpersonal_communication
In simple terms, interpersonal_communication is the communication between one
person and another (or others). It is often referred to as face-to-face
communication between two (or more) people. Both verbal and nonverbal
communication, or body_language, play a part in how one person understands
another. In verbal interpersonal communication there are two types of messages
being sent: a content message and a relational message. Content messages are
messages about the topic at hand and relational messages are messages about the
relationship itself.[14] This means that relational messages come across in how
one says something and it demonstrates a person's feelings, whether positive or
negative, towards the individual they are talking to, indicating not only how
they feel about the topic at hand, but also how they feel about their
relationship with the other individual.[14]
There are many different aspects of interpersonal_communication including:
    * Audiovisual Perception of Communication Problems.[15] The concept follows
      the idea that our words change what form they take based on the stress
      level or urgency of the situation. It also explores the concept that
      stuttering during speech shows the audience that there is a problem or
      that the situation is more stressful.
    * The Attachment Theory.[16] This is the combined work of John Bowlby and
      Mary Ainsworth (Ainsworth & Bowlby, 1991) This theory follows the
      relationships that builds between a mother and child, and the impact it
      has on their relationships with others.
    * Emotional Intelligence and Triggers.[17] Emotional Intelligence focuses
      on the ability to monitor ones own emotions as well as those of others.
      Emotional Triggers focus on events or people that tend to set off
      intense, emotional reactions within individuals.
    * Attribution Theory.[18] This is the study of how individuals explain what
      causes different events and behaviors.
    * The Power of Words (Verbal communications).[19] Verbal communication
      focuses heavily on the power of words, and how those words are said. It
      takes into consideration tone, volume, and choice of words.
    * Nonverbal Communication. It focuses heavily on the setting that the words
      are conveyed in, as well as the physical tone of the words.
    * Ethics in Personal Relations.[20] It is about a space of mutual
      responsibility between two individuals, it's about giving and receiving
      in a relationship. This theory is explored by Dawn J. Lipthrott in the
      article What IS Relationship? What is Ethical Partnership?
    * Deception in Communication.[21] This concept goes into that everyone
      lies, and how this can impact relationships. This theory is explored by
      James Hearn in his article Interpersonal Deception Theory: Ten Lessons
      for Negotiators
    * Conflict in Couples.[22] This focuses on the impact that social media has
      on relationships, as well as how to communicate through conflict. This
      theory is explored by Amanda Lenhart and Maeve Duggan in their paper
      Couples, the Internet, and Social Media
***** Barriers to effectiveness[edit] *****
Barriers to effective communication can retard or distort the message or
intention of the message being conveyed. This may result in failure of the
communication process or cause an effect that is undesirable. These include
filtering, selective perception, information overload, emotions, language,
silence, communication apprehension, gender differences and political
correctness.[23]
This also includes a lack of expressing "knowledge-appropriate" communication,
which occurs when a person uses ambiguous or complex legal words, medical
jargon, or descriptions of a situation or environment that is not understood by
the recipient.
    * Physical barriers â Physical barriers are often due to the nature of
      the environment. An example of this is the natural barrier which exists
      if staff is located in different buildings or on different sites.
      Likewise, poor or outdated equipment, particularly the failure of
      management to introduce new technology, may also cause problems. Staff
      shortages are another factor which frequently causes communication
      difficulties for an organization.
    * System design â System_design faults refer to problems with the
      structures or systems in place in an organization. Examples might include
      an organizational structure which is unclear and therefore makes it
      confusing to know whom to communicate with. Other examples could be
      inefficient or inappropriate information systems, a lack of supervision
      or training, and a lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities which
      can lead to staff being uncertain about what is expected of them.
    * Attitudinal barriersâ Attitudinal barriers come about as a result of
      problems with staff in an organization. These may be brought about, for
      example, by such factors as poor management, lack of consultation with
      employees, personality conflicts which can result in people delaying or
      refusing to communicate, the personal attitudes of individual employees
      which may be due to lack of motivation or dissatisfaction at work,
      brought about by insufficient training to enable them to carry out
      particular tasks, or simply resistance to change due to entrenched
      attitudes and ideas.[citation_needed]
    * Ambiguity of words/phrases â Words sounding the same but having
      different meaning can convey a different meaning altogether. Hence the
      communicator must ensure that the receiver receives the same meaning. It
      is better if such words are avoided by using alternatives whenever
      possible.
    * Individual linguistic ability â The use of jargon, difficult or
      inappropriate words in communication can prevent the recipients from
      understanding the message. Poorly explained or misunderstood messages can
      also result in confusion. However, research in communication has shown
      that confusion can lend legitimacy to research when persuasion fails.[24]
      [25]
    * Physiological barriers â These may result from individuals' personal
      discomfort, causedâfor exampleâby ill health, poor eyesight or
      hearing difficulties.
    * Bypassing â These happens when the communicators (sender and the
      receiver) do not attach the same symbolic meanings to their words. It is
      when the sender is expressing a thought or a word but the receiver takes
      it in a different meaning. For example- ASAP, Rest room
    * Technological multi-tasking and absorbency â With a rapid increase in
      technologically-driven communication in the past several decades,
      individuals are increasingly faced with condensed communication in the
      form of e-mail, text, and social updates. This has, in turn, led to a
      notable change in the way younger generations communicate and perceive
      their own self-efficacy to communicate and connect with others. With the
      ever-constant presence of another "world" in one's pocket, individuals
      are multi-tasking both physically and cognitively as constant reminders
      of something else happening somewhere else bombard them. Though perhaps
      too new of an advancement to yet see long-term effects, this is a notion
      currently explored by such figures as Sherry Turkle.[26]
    * Fear of being criticized â This is a major factor that prevents good
      communication. If we exercise simple practices to improve our
      communication skill, we can become effective communicators. For example,
      read an article from the newspaper or collect some news from the
      television and present it in front of the mirror. This will not only
      boost your confidence but also improve your language and vocabulary.
    * Gender barriers â Most communicators whether aware or not, often have a
      set agenda. This is very notable among the different genders. For
      example, many women are found to be more critical in addressing conflict.
      It's also been noted that men are more than likely to withdraw from
      conflict when in comparison to women.[27] This breakdown and comparison
      not only shows that there are many factors to communication between two
      specific genders but also room for improvement as well as established
      guidelines for all.
**** Cultural aspects[edit] ****
Cultural differences exist within countries (tribal/regional differences,
dialects etc.), between religious groups and in organisations or at an
organisational level â where companies, teams and units may have different
expectations, norms and idiolects. Families and family groups may also
experience the effect of cultural barriers to communication within and between
different family members or groups. For example: words, colours and symbols
have different meanings in different cultures. In most parts of the world,
nodding your head means agreement, shaking your head means no, except in some
parts of the world.[28]
Communication to a great extent is influenced by culture and cultural
variables.[29][30][31][32] Understanding cultural aspects of communication
refers to having knowledge of different cultures in order to communicate
effectively with cross culture people. Cultural aspects of communication are of
great relevance in today's world which is now a global_village, thanks to
globalisation. Cultural aspects of communication are the cultural differences
which influences communication across borders. Impact of cultural differences
on communication components are explained below:
   1. Verbal_communication refers to form of communication which uses spoken
      and written words for expressing and transferring views and ideas.
      Language is the most important tool of verbal communication and it is the
      area where cultural difference play its role. All countries have
      different languages and to have a better understanding of different
      culture it is required to have knowledge of languages of different
      countries.
   2. Non-verbal_communication is a very wide concept and it includes all the
      other forms of communication which do not uses written or spoken words.
      Non verbal communication takes following forms:
          o Paralinguistics are the voice involved in communication other than
            actual language and involves tones, pitch, vocal cues etc. It also
            include sounds from throat and all these are greatly influenced by
            cultural differences across borders.
          o Proxemics deals with the concept of the space element in
            communication. Proxemics explains four zones of spaces, namely
            intimate, personal, social and public. This concept differs from
            culture to culture as the permissible space varies in different
            countries.
          o Artifactics studies the non_verbal_signals or communication which
            emerges from personal accessories such as the dress or fashion
            accessories worn and it varies with culture as people of different
            countries follow different dressing codes.
          o Chronemics deals with the time aspects of communication and also
            includes the importance given to time. Some issues explaining this
            concept are pauses, silences and response lag during an
            interaction. This aspect of communication is also influenced by
            cultural_differences as it is well known that there is a great
            difference in the value given by different cultures to time.
          o Kinesics mainly deals with body_language such as postures,
            gestures, head_nods, leg movements, etc. In different countries,
            the same gestures and postures are used to convey different
            messages. Sometimes even a particular kinesic indicating something
            good in a country may have a negative meaning in another culture.
So in order to have an effective communication across the world it is desirable
to have a knowledge of cultural variables effecting communication.
According to Michael Walsh and Ghil'ad_Zuckermann, Western conversational
interaction is typically "dyadic", between two particular people, where eye
contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and "contained"
in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Aboriginal
conversational interaction is "communal", broadcast to many people, eye contact
is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and "continuous",
spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.[33][34]
***** Nonhuman[edit] *****
See also: Biocommunication_(science), Interspecies_communication, and
Biosemiotics
Every information_exchange between living organisms â i.e. transmission of
signals that involve a living sender and receiver can be considered a form of
communication; and even primitive creatures such as corals are competent to
communicate. Nonhuman communication also include cell_signaling, cellular
communication, and chemical transmissions between primitive organisms like
bacteria and within the plant and fungal kingdoms.
**** Animals[edit] ****
The broad field of animal_communication encompasses most of the issues in
ethology. Animal_communication can be defined as any behavior of one animal
that affects the current or future behavior of another animal. The study of
animal communication, called zoo semiotics (distinguishable from
anthroposemiotics, the study of human communication) has played an important
part in the development of ethology, sociobiology, and the study of animal
cognition. Animal communication, and indeed the understanding of the animal
world in general, is a rapidly growing field, and even in the 21st century so
far, a great share of prior understanding related to diverse fields such as
personal symbolic name use, animal_emotions, animal_culture and learning, and
even sexual_conduct, long thought to be well understood, has been
revolutionized.
**** Plants and fungi[edit] ****
Communication is observed within the plant organism, i.e. within plant_cells
and between plant cells, between plants of the same or related species, and
between plants and non-plant organisms, especially in the root_zone. Plant
roots communicate with rhizome bacteria, fungi, and insects within the soil.
Recent research has shown that most of the microorganism plant communication
processes are neuron-like.[35] Plants also communicate via volatiles when
exposed to herbivory attack behavior, thus warning neighboring plants.[36] In
parallel they produce other volatiles to attract parasites which attack these
herbivores.
Fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such
as the formation of Marcelia and fruiting_bodies. Fungi communicate with their
own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety
of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, unicellular eukaryote,
plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals
trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same
chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the
fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate
between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being
irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules
are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation,
mating, growth, and pathogenicity. Behavioral coordination and production of
signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables
the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic
message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out
"noise", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.
**** Bacteria quorum sensing[edit] ****
Communication is not a tool used only by humans, plants and animals, but it is
also used by microorganisms like bacteria. The process is called quorum
sensing. Through quorum sensing, bacteria are able to sense the density of
cells, and regulate gene expression accordingly. This can be seen in both gram
positive and gram negative bacteria. This was first observed by Fuqua et al. in
marine microorganisms like V._harveyi and V._fischeri.[37]
***** Models[edit] *****
Main article: Models_of_communication
Shannon and Weaver Model of Communication
Communication major dimensions scheme
Interactional Model of Communication
Berlo's Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver Model of Communication
Transactional model of communication
Communication code scheme
Linear Communication Model
The first major model for communication was introduced by Claude_Shannon and
Warren_Weaver for Bell Laboratories in 1949[38] The original model was designed
to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technologies. Their initial
model consisted of three primary parts: sender, channel, and receiver. The
sender was the part of a telephone a person spoke into, the channel was the
telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone where one could
hear the other person. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that often there is
static that interferes with one listening to a telephone conversation, which
they deemed noise.
In a simple model, often referred to as the transmission model or standard view
of communication, information or content (e.g. a message in natural_language)
is sent in some form (as spoken_language) from an emitter (emisor in the
picture)/ sender/ encoder to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. This common
conception of communication simply views communication as a means of sending
and receiving information. The strengths of this model are simplicity,
generality, and quantifiability. Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured
this model based on the following elements:
   1. An information source, which produces a message.
   2. A transmitter, which encodes the message into signals
   3. A channel, to which signals are adapted for transmission
   4. A noise source, which distorts the signal while it propagates through the
      channel
   5. A receiver, which 'decodes' (reconstructs) the message from the signal.
   6. A destination, where the message arrives.
Shannon and Weaver argued that there were three levels of problems for
communication within this theory.
      The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
      The semantic problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
      The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning
      affect behavior?
Daniel_Chandler[39] critiques the transmission model by stating:
      It assumes communicators are isolated individuals.
      No allowance for differing purposes.
      No allowance for differing interpretations.

In 1960, David Berlo expanded on Shannon and Weaver's (1949) linear model of
communication and created the SMCR Model of Communication.[40] The Sender-
Message-Channel-Receiver Model of communication separated the model into clear
parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.
Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what
type of things are communicated), source / emisor / sender / encoder (by whom),
form (in which form), channel (through which medium), destination / receiver /
target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. Wilbur Schram (1954) also indicated
that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and
undesired) on the target of the message.[41] Between parties, communication
includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands,
and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various
manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group
communicating. Together, communication content and form make messages that are
sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another person or being,
another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).
Communication can be seen as processes of information_transmission with three
levels of semiotic rules:
   1. Pragmatic (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and
      their users)
   2. Semantic (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they
      represent) and
   3. Syntactic (formal properties of signs and symbols).
Therefore, communication is social_interaction where at least two interacting
agents share a common set of signs and a common set of semiotic rules. This
commonly held rule in some sense ignores autocommunication, including
intrapersonal_communication via diaries or self-talk, both secondary phenomena
that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within
social interactions.
In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (2008) proposed a transactional model of
communication.[42] The basic premise of the transactional model of
communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending
and receiving of messages.
In a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked
reciprocally. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the
constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual
communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be
interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which
information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes
separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication
is called a speech_act. The sender's personal filters and the receiver's
personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions,
cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.
In the presence of "communication_noise" on the transmission channel (air, in
this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the
speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-
transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding
imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a
codebook, and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not
identical. Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are
nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.
Theories of coregulation describe communication as a creative and dynamic
continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian
media scholar Harold_Innis had the theory that people use different types of
media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different
possibilities for the shape and durability of society.[43][page needed] His
famous example of this is using ancient_Egypt and looking at the ways they
built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus.
Papyrus is what he called 'Space_Binding'. it made possible the transmission of
written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military
campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and 'Time_Binding',
through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their
authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and
shape communication in their society.[43][page needed]
***** Noise[edit] *****
In any communication model, noise is interference with the decoding of messages
sent over a channel by an encoder. There are many examples of noise:
    * Environmental noise. Noise that physically disrupts communication, such
      as standing next to loud speakers at a party, or the noise from a
      construction site next to a classroom making it difficult to hear the
      professor.
    * Physiological-impairment noise. Physical maladies that prevent effective
      communication, such as actual deafness or blindness preventing messages
      from being received as they were intended.
    * Semantic noise. Different interpretations of the meanings of certain
      words. For example, the word "weed" can be interpreted as an undesirable
      plant_in_a_yard, or as a euphemism for marijuana.
    * Syntactical noise. Mistakes in grammar can disrupt communication, such as
      abrupt changes in verb_tense during a sentence.
    * Organizational noise. Poorly structured communication can prevent the
      receiver from accurate interpretation. For example, unclear and badly
      stated directions can make the receiver even more lost.
    * Cultural noise. Stereotypical assumptions can cause misunderstandings,
      such as unintentionally offending a non-Christian person by wishing them
      a "Merry Christmas".
    * Psychological noise. Certain attitudes can also make communication
      difficult. For instance, great anger or sadness may cause someone to lose
      focus on the present moment. Disorders such as autism may also severely
      hamper effective communication.[44]
To face communication noise, redundancy and acknowledgement must often be used.
Acknowledgements are messages from the addressee informing the originator that
his/her communication has been received and is understood.[45] Message
repetition and feedback about message received are necessary in the presence of
noise to reduce the probability of misunderstanding. The act of disambiguation
regards the attempt of reducing noise and wrong interpretations, when the
semantic value or meaning of a sign can be subject to noise, or in presence of
multiple meanings, which makes the sense-making difficult. Disambiguation
attempts to decrease the likelihood of misunderstanding. This is also a
fundamental skill in communication processes activated by counselors,
psychotherapists, interpreters, and in coaching sessions based on colloquium.
In Information Technology, the disambiguation process and the automatic
disambiguation of meanings of words and sentences has also been an interest and
concern since the earliest days of computer treatment of language.[46]
***** As academic discipline[edit] *****
Main article: Communication_studies
The academic discipline that deals with processes of human communication is
communication studies. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-
to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting.
Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the
political, cultural, economic, semiotic, hermeneutic, and social dimensions of
their contexts. Statistics, as a quantitative approach to communication
science, has also been incorporated into research on communication science in
order to help substantiate claims.[47]
