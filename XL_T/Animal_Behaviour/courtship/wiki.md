Courtship is the period of development towards an intimate_relationship wherein
a couple get to know each other and decide if there will be an engagement,
followed by a marriage. A courtship may be an informal and private matter
between two people or may be a public affair, or a formal arrangement with
family approval. Traditionally, in the case of a formal engagement, it has been
perceived that it is the role of a male to actively "court" or "woo" a female,
thus encouraging her to understand him and her receptiveness to a marriage
proposal.

***** Duration[edit] *****
The average duration of courtship varies considerably throughout the world.
Furthermore, there is vast individual variation between couples. Courtship may
be completely omitted, as in cases of some arranged_marriages where the couple
do not meet before the wedding.
In the United_Kingdom, a poll of 3,000[1] engaged or married couples resulted
in an average duration between first meeting and accepted proposal_of_marriage
of 2 years and 11 months,[1][2] with the women feeling ready to accept at an
average of 2 years and 7 months.[1] Regarding duration between proposal and
wedding, the UK poll above gave an average of 2 years and 3 months.[2]
***** Traditions[edit] *****
Youth conversing with suitors
from the Haft Awrang of Jami, in the story A Father Advises his Son About Love.
The date is fairly casual in most European-influenced cultures, but in some
traditional societies, courtship is a highly structured activity, with very
specific formal rules.
In some societies, the parents or community propose potential partners and then
allow limited dating to determine whether the parties are suited. In Japan,
there is a such type of courtship called Omiai, with similar practices called
"Xiangqin" (ç¸è¦ª) in the Greater_China_Area.[3] Parents will hire a
matchmaker to provide pictures and rÃ©sumÃ©s of potential mates, and if the
couple agrees, there will be a formal meeting with the matchmaker and often
parents in attendance.[3] The matchmaker and parents will often exert pressure
on the couple to decide whether they want to marry or not after a few dates.
Courtship_in_the_Philippines is one known complex form of courtship. Unlike
what is regularly seen in other societies, it takes a far more subdued and
indirect approach.[4] It is complex in that it involves stages, and it is
considered normal for courtship to last a year or longer. It is common to see
the male showing off by sending love letters and love poems, singing romantic
songs, and buying gifts for the female. The parents are also seen as part of
the courtship practice, as their approval is commonly needed before courtship
may begin or before the female gives the male an answer to his advances.[4]
In more closed societies, courtship is virtually eliminated altogether by the
practice of arranged marriages[3] in which partners are chosen for young
people, typically by their parents. Forbidding experimental and serial
courtship and sanctioning only arranged matches is partly a means of guarding
the chastity of young people and partly a matter of furthering family
interests, which, in such cultures, may be considered more important than
individual romantic preferences.
Throughout history, courtship has often included traditions such as exchanging
valentines, written correspondence (which was facilitated by the creation of
the postal service in the nineteenth century), and similar communication-based
courting.[5] Over recent decades, though, the concept of arranged marriage has
changed or simply been mixed with other forms of dating, including Eastern and
Indian ones; potential couples have the opportunity to meet and date each other
before one decides on whether or not to continue the relationship.
***** Modern people[edit] *****
Main article: Dating
In the earlier 1800s, young adults were expected to court with the intention of
finding a marriage partner, rather than for social reasons. In more traditional
forms of Christianity, this concept of courtship has been retained, with John
Piper defining courtship and distinguishing this concept from dating, stating
that:[6]
     Courtship ordinarily begins when a single man approaches a single
     woman by going through the woman's father, and then conducts his
     relationship with the woman under the authority of her father,
     family, or church, whichever is most appropriate. Courtship always
     has marriage as its direct goal...Dating, a more modern approach,
     begins when either the man or the woman initiates a more-than-friends
     relationship with the other, and then they conduct that relationship
     outside of any oversight or authority. Dating may or may not have
     marriage as its goal.[6]
Christian_minister Patricia Bootsma delineates this distinction, writing that
in contrast to the modern conception of dating, in "courtship, time together in
groups with family or friends is encouraged, and there is oversight by and
accountability to parents or mentors".[7] She further states that with
courtship, "commitment happens before intimacy".[7]
In America, in the 1820s, the phrase "date" was most closely associated with
prostitution. However, by the Jazz_Age of the 1920s, dating for fun was
becoming a cultural expectation, and by the 1930s, it was assumed that any
popular young person would have lots of dates. This form of dating, though, was
usually more chaste than is seen today, since premarital sex was not considered
the norm.
**** Courtship in social theory[edit] ****
Courtship is used by a number of theorists to explain gendering processes and
sexual identity. Scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s after
which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern
dating practices and norms. Researchers have found that, contrary to popular
beliefs, courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women, [8][9][10]
[11][12] driven mainly by non-verbal behaviours to which men respond.
This is generally supported by other theorists who specialise in the study of
body language.[13] There are some feminist scholars, however, who regard
courtship as a socially constructed (and male-led) process organised to
subjugate women.[14][15] Farrell reports, for example, that magazines about
marriage and romantic fiction continue to attract a 98% female readership.[16]
Systematic research into courtship processes inside the workplace[17] as well
two 10-year studies examining norms in different international settings[18][19]
continue to support a view that courtship is a social process that socialises
both sexes into accepting forms of relationship that maximise the chances of
successfully raising children.
**** Courtship in Australia[edit] ****
Courtship in Australia is generally reserved to those with religious
affiliation. As a standard rule, dating is widely accepted; along with inter-
racial relationships, gay/lesbian relationships, pre-marital sex and abortion.
[20] A lot of the Australian values are derived from British courtship culture;
therefore, marriage practices are much the same. Modern western culture has
taken over, leading to more and more people committing to partnerships through
dating. Before entering marriage, a lot of Australian couples like to live with
each other to get an idea of what married life would be like. This would not
happen in a courtship as both people vow to chastity and often like to keep a
chaperone around.[20]
**** Commercial dating services[edit] ****
As technology progressed the dating world followed. In a Time-line by Metro, a
statistic match-making business opened in 1941, the first reality TV dating
show was developed in 1965 and by the 1980s the public was introduced to video
dating.[21] Video Dating was a way for singles to sit in front of a camera and
tell whomever may be watching something about themselves. The process_of
elimination was significant because now the viewer was able hear their voice,
see their face and watch their body language to determine a physical_attraction
to the candidates.
In online_dating, individuals create profiles where they disclose personal
information, photographs, hobbies, interests, religion and expectations. Then
the user can search through hundreds of thousands of accounts and connect with
multiple people at once which in return, gives the user more options and more
opportunity to find what meets their standards. Online dating has influenced
the idea of choice. In Modern_Romance:_An_Investigation, Aziz_Ansari states
that one third of marriages in the United States between 2005-2012 met through
online dating services.[22] Today there are hundreds of sites to choose from
and websites designed to fit specific needs such as Match, eHarmony, OkCupid,
Zoosk, and ChristianMingle. Mobile apps, such as Grindr and Tinder allow users
to upload profiles that are then judged by others on the service; one can
either swipe right on a profile (indicating interest) or swipe left (which
presents another possible mate).
***** In animals[edit] *****
Further information: Mating, Mating_system, and Courtship_display
Many animal species have mate-selection rituals also referred to as "courtship"
anthropomorphically. Animal courtship may involve complicated dances or
touching, vocalizations, or displays of beauty or fighting prowess. Most animal
courtship occurs out of sight of humans and so it is often the least documented
of animal behaviors. One animal whose courtship rituals are well studied is the
bower_bird whose male builds a "bower" of collected objects.
From the scientific point of view, courtship in the animal kingdom is the
process in which the different species select their partners for reproduction
purposes. Generally speaking, the male initiates the courtship and the female
chooses to either mate or reject the male based on his "performance".
**** Sea turtles[edit] ****
Courtship of green_turtles
All animals have different courtship rituals that reflect fitness,
compatibility with others and ability to provide. Sea turtles court during a
limited receptive time. During the courtship males will either nuzzle the
females head to show affection or by gently biting the back of her neck.[23]
This may go on for long periods of time depending on if the female responds to
the male. If the female does respond, by not fleeing, the male will attach
himself onto the back of the femaleâs shell using his front flippers.[23] He
will stretch his long tail under the back of the females shell to begin
copulation.
Courting can be competitive among males. The male that has better endurance
will win the female. To a female, endurance is a great trait to be passed on to
their offspring, the higher the endurance in the male the higher the endurance
will be in her offspring and the more likely they will be to survive.[23]
Female Leatherback sea turtles will also choose many different males to
copulate with in order to diversify their offspring since it is known that
Leatherback sea turtles have female-biased offspring.
**** Hippopotamus[edit] ****
Hippopotamus are commonly misconceived as being aggressive animals, when in
actuality the mothers are very nurturing and sensitive.[24] Mating and birth
both occur in the water for hippopotamus. This because it gives them privacy
when conceiving and it helps conserve energy during birth. The female hippo
normally averages around 5â6 years while males are average an age of 7-8.[24]
During mating season the male hippopotamus will find a mate out of the herd,
showing interest by smelling the femaleâs dorsal end.[25] As long as the male
acts submissive during courting season the adults in the herd will not
interfere. Once the male finds the female he wants to mate with, he begins
provoking the female. He then will push the female into the water and mounts
her. In order to alert the herd or other animals that may be lurking around the
male will let a loud wheezing sound.[25] Preceding birth the female exhibits
aggressive behavior leaving the herd until after the birth of the calf.
Although hippopotamus can mate anytime of the year, the mating season ranges
from February to August. Because the energy cost is high, the female generally
only has one offspring in a two years span.[24]
**** Honeybees[edit] ****
The courtship behaviour of honey bees follows through two distinct types:
Apiary Vicinity Mating and Drone Assembly Mating respectively.[26] Apiary
vicinity mating usually takes place in weather that is cool and is more local
to the apiary from which the queen resides.[26] The drones are in the same
apiary too but do not mean that it will lead to inbreeding. Drones assemble in
a bulb of warm air close or far from the apiary. They are alert when the queen
has flown out of the hive and will follow her route. This is followed by a sort
of fast hum or buzz in the general bee population that follows an upward
temperature gradient.[26] The male drone mounts on the virgin queen and inserts
his endophallus, ejaculating semen.[27] The male honey bee will then pull away
from the queen, but his endophallus will be ripped from his body and remain
attached to the newly fertilized queen. The next male honey bee will remove the
endophallus that was previously left by the other male honey bee and will
eventually ejaculate and lose his own.[27] The frequency of mating for the male
honey bees is seven to 10 times during a mating flight. Most of the drones die
quickly immediately after mating, and their abdomen rips open since the
endophallus has been removed.[27] The few that survive are usually ejected from
their nests, as they have served their sole purpose by mating .
They only attend one mating flight and queen stores up to 100 million sperm
within her oviducts during this flight, but only five to six million are stored
in the spermatheca of the queen.[27] Only a few of this sperm are used by the
queen at a time to fertilize the eggs throughout her life. New queen
generations will mate and produce their colonies if the queen runs out of sperm
in her lifetime. The sex of the offspring is controlled by the honey bee queens
as the eggs passing through the oviduct can be determined whether they are
fertilized or not by the queen.[27] Research has indicated that eggs that are
fertilized develop into female workers and queens while the unfertilized eggs
become drone honey bees. Female workers can lay infertile eggs but do not mate.
The infertile eggs become male honey bees. The eggs of the queen are laid in
oval-shaped structural cells that usually stick to the nest ceiling. Royal
jelly is then filled with these cells to prevent larvae from falling.[27] Soon-
to-be workers are fed royal jelly during the first two days. The future queens
are given royal jelly throughout the entire larval period. Each member colony
development depends on caste. For proper growth from eggs to adult, the male
honey bees need 24 days, 21 for workers and only 16 for the queens.
