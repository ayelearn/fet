Instinct or innate behavior is the inherent inclination of a living organism
towards a particular complex behavior. The simplest example of an instinctive
behavior is a fixed_action_pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium
length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a
corresponding clearly defined stimulus.

Any behavior is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior
experience (that is, in the absence of learning), and is therefore an
expression of innate biological factors. Sea_turtles, newly hatched on a beach,
will automatically move toward the ocean. A marsupial climbs into its mother's
pouch upon being born. Honeybees communicate by dancing in the direction of a
food source without formal instruction. Other examples include animal fighting,
animal courtship behavior, internal escape functions, and the building of
nests. Though an instinct is defined by its invariant innate characteristics,
details of its performance can be changed by experience; for example, a dog can
improve its fighting skills by practice.
Instincts are inborn complex patterns of behavior that exist in most members of
the species, and should be distinguished from reflexes, which are simple
responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the
pupil in response to bright light or the spasmodic movement of the lower leg
when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be
confused with an inability to modify fixed action patterns. For example, people
may be able to modify a stimulated fixed action pattern by consciously
recognizing the point of its activation and simply stop doing it, whereas
animals without a sufficiently strong volitional capacity may not be able to
disengage from their fixed action patterns, once activated.[1]

***** History[edit] *****
Primitive_reflexes
**** In animal biology[edit] ****
Jean_Henri_Fabre (1823-1915), an entomologist, considered instinct to be any
behavior which did not require cognition or consciousness to perform. Fabre's
inspiration was his intense study of insects, some of whose behaviors he
wrongly considered fixed and not subject to environmental influence.[2]
Instinct as a concept fell out of favor in the 1920s with the rise of
behaviorism and such thinkers as B._F._Skinner, which held that most
significant behavior is learned.
An interest in innate behaviors arose again in the 1950s with Konrad_Lorenz and
Nikolaas_Tinbergen, who made the distinction between instinct and learned
behaviors. Our modern understanding of instinctual behavior in animals owes
much to their work. For instance, there exists a sensitive period for a bird in
which it learns the identity of its mother. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose
imprint on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whoever wore the boots.
This suggests that the identity of the goose's mother was learned, but the
goose's behavior towards what it perceived as its mother was instinctive.
**** In psychology[edit] ****
The term "instinct" in psychology was first used in the 1870s by Wilhelm_Wundt.
By the close of the 19th century, most repeated behavior was considered
instinctual. In a survey of the literature at that time, one researcher[who?]
chronicled 4,000 human "instincts," having applied this label to any behavior
that was repetitive.[citation_needed] In the early twentieth century, there was
recognized a "union of instinct and emotion".[3] William_McDougall held that
many instincts have their respective associated specific emotions.[4] As
research became more rigorous and terms better defined, instinct as an
explanation for human behavior became less common. In 1932, McDougall argued
that the word 'instinct' is more suitable for describing animal behaviour,
while he recommended the word 'propensity' for goal directed combinations of
the many innate human abilities, which are loosely and variably linked, in a
way that shows strong plasticity.[5] In a conference in 1960, chaired by Frank
Beach, a pioneer in comparative_psychology, and attended by luminaries in the
field, the term 'instinct' was restricted in its application.[citation_needed]
During the 1960s and 1970s, textbooks still contained some discussion of
instincts in reference to human behavior. By the year 2000, a survey of the 12
best selling textbooks in Introductory Psychology revealed only one reference
to instincts, and that was in regard to Sigmund_Freud's referral to the "id"
instincts.[citation_needed] In this sense, the term 'instinct' appeared to have
become outmoded for introductory textbooks on human psychology.
Sigmund Freud considered that mental images of bodily needs, expressed in the
form of desires, are called instincts. [6]
Psychologist Abraham_Maslow argued that humans no longer have instincts because
we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what
is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong
drives. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and
therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer
does.[7]
The book Instinct: an enduring problem in psychology (1961)[8] selected a range
of writings about the topic.
F.B. Mandal proposed a set of criteria by which a behavior might be considered
instinctual: a) be automatic, b) be irresistible, c) occur at some point in
development, d) be triggered by some event in the environment, e) occur in
every member of the species, f) be unmodifiable, and g) govern behavior for
which the organism needs no training (although the organism may profit from
experience and to that degree the behavior is modifiable).[9]
In a classic paper published in 1972,[10] the psychologist Richard_Herrnstein
wrote: "A comparison of McDougall's theory of instinct and Skinner's
reinforcement theory â representing nature and nurture â shows remarkable,
and largely unrecognized, similarities between the contending sides in the
nature-nurture dispute as applied to the analysis of behavior."
In Information behavior: An Evolutionary Instinct (2010, pp. 35â42), Amanda
Spink notes that "currently in the behavioral sciences instinct is generally
understood as the innate part of behavior that emerges without any training or
education in humans." She claims that the viewpoint that information behavior
has an instinctive basis is grounded in the latest thinking on human behavior.
Furthermore, she notes that "behaviors such as cooperation, sexual behavior,
child rearing and aesthetics are [also] seen as 'evolved psychological
mechanisms' with an instinctive basis."[11][12][13] Spink adds that Steven
Pinker similarly asserts that language acquisition is instinctive in humans in
his book The_Language_Instinct (1994). In 1908, William_McDougall wrote about
the "instinct of curiosity" and its associated "emotion of wonder",[14] though
Spink's book does not mention this.
M.S. Blumberg in 2017 examined the use of the word instinct, and found it
varied significantly.[15]
***** The existence of instincts in humans[edit] *****
The simplest instincts in humans is a widely debated topic.
   1. Congenital fear of snakes and spiders was found in six-month-old babies.
      [16]
   2. Infant cry is a manifestation of instinct. The infant cannot otherwise
      protect itself for survival during its long period of maturation. The
      maternal instinct, manifest particularly in response to the infant cry,
      has long been respected as one of the most powerful. Its mechanism has
      been partly elucidated by observations with functional MRI of the
      motherâs brain.[17]
   3. The herd instinct is found in human children and chimpanzee cubs, but is
      apparently absent in the young orangutans.[18]
   4. Testosterone (main male sex hormone) primes several instincts, especially
      sexuality; also dominance, manifest in self-affirmation, the urge to win
      over rivals, to dominate a hierarchy, and to respond to violent signals
      in men, with weakening of empathy.[19] In men, a decrease in testosterone
      level after the birth of a child in the family was found, so that the
      fatherâs energies are more directed to nurturing, protecting and caring
      for the child.[20][21] Unduly high levels of this hormone are often
      associated in a person with aggressiveness, illegal behavior, violence
      against others, such phenomena as banditry, etc.[22] This is confirmed by
      studies conducted in prisons.[23][24] The amount of testosterone in men
      may increase dramatically in response to any competition.[25] In men, the
      level of testosterone varies depending on whether it is susceptible to
      the smell of an ovulating or non-ovulatory woman. Men exposed to the
      odors of ovulating women maintained a stable level of testosterone, which
      was higher than the level of testosterone in men exposed to non-ovulatory
      signals. This is due to the fact that an ovulating woman is capable of
      conceiving, and therefore a man who feels the smell of an ovulating woman
      is given a signal to sexual activity.[26]
   5. Squeamishness and disgust in humans is an instinct developed during
      evolution to protect the body and avoid infection by various diseases.
      [27]
***** Reflexes[edit] *****
Main article: Reflex
Examples of behaviors that do not require conscious will include many reflexes.
The stimulus in a reflex may not require brain activity but instead may travel
to the spinal cord as a message that is then transmitted back through the body,
tracing a path called the reflex_arc. Reflexes are similar to fixed_action
patterns in that most reflexes meet the criteria of a FAP. However, a fixed
action pattern can be processed in the brain as well; a male stickleback's
instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an
example. Examples of instinctive behaviors in humans include many of the
primitive_reflexes, such as rooting and suckling, behaviors which are present
in mammals. In rats, it has been observed that innate responses are related to
specific chemicals, and these chemicals are detected by two organs located in
the nose: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE).
[28]
***** Maturational[edit] *****
Some instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear. For
instance, we commonly refer to birds "learning" to fly. However, young birds
have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their
wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying. These
birds flew immediately and normally when released, showing that their
improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning.[29]
***** In evolution[edit] *****
Imprinting provides one example of instinct.[15] This complex response may
involve visual, auditory, and olfactory cues in the environment surrounding an
organism. In some cases, imprinting attaches an offspring to its parent, which
is a reproductive benefit to offspring survival.[30][31] If an offspring has
attachment to a parent, it is more likely to stay nearby under parental
protection. Attached offspring are also more likely to learn from a parental
figure when interacting closely. (Reproductive benefits are a driving force
behind natural_selection.)
Environment is an important factor in how innate behavior has evolved. A
hypothesis of Michael McCollough, a positive_psychologist, explains that
environment plays a key role in human behaviors such as forgiveness and
revenge. This hypothesis theorizes that various social environments cause
either forgiveness or revenge to prevail. McCollough relates his theory to game
theory.[32] In a tit-for-tat strategy, cooperation and retaliation are
comparable to forgiveness and revenge. The choice between the two can be
beneficial or detrimental, depending on what the partner-organism chooses.
Though this psychological example of game theory does not have such directly
measurable results, it provides an interesting theory of unique thought. From a
more biological standpoint, the brain's limbic_system operates as the main
control-area for response to certain stimuli, including a variety of
instinctual behavior. The limbic system processes external stimuli related to
emotions, social activity, and motivation, which propagates a behavioral
response. Some behaviors include maternal care, aggression, defense, and social
hierarchy. These behaviors are influenced by sensory input â sight, sound,
touch, and smell.
Within the circuitry of the limbic system, there are various places where
evolution could have taken place, or could take place in the future. For
example, many rodents have receptors in the vomeronasal_organ that respond
explicitly to predator stimuli that specifically relate to that individual
species of rodent. The reception of a predatory stimulus usually creates a
response of defense or fear.[28] Mating in rats follows a similar mechanism.
The vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, together called the
olfactory_system, detect pheromones from the opposite sex. These signals then
travel to the medial amygdala, which disperses the signal to a variety of brain
parts. The pathways involved with innate circuitry are extremely specialized
and specific.[28] Various organs and sensory receptors play parts in this
complex process.
Instinct is a phenomenon that can be investigated from a multitude of angles:
genetics, limbic system, nervous pathways, and environment. Researchers can
study levels of instincts, from molecular to groups of individuals. Extremely
specialized systems have evolved, resulting in individuals which exhibit
behaviors without learning them.
