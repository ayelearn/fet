Glycolysis

The metabolic_pathway of glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate by via a
series of intermediate metabolites. Each chemical modification (red box) is
performed by a different enzyme. Steps 1 and 3 consume ATP (blue) and steps 7
and 10 produce ATP (yellow). Since steps 6-10 occur twice per glucose molecule,
this leads to a net production of ATP.
Summary of aerobic respiration
Glycolysis (from glycose, an older term[1] for glucose + -lysis degradation) is
the metabolic_pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOOâ
+ H+. The free_energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy
molecules ATP (adenosine_triphosphate) and NADH (reduced_nicotinamide_adenine
dinucleotide).[2][3] Glycolysis is a sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed
reactions. Most monosaccharides, such as fructose and galactose, can be
converted to one of these intermediates. The intermediates may also be directly
useful rather than just utilized as steps in the overall reaction. For example,
the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is a source of the glycerol
that combines with fatty acids to form fat.
Glycolysis is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway. The wide occurrence of
glycolysis indicates that it is an ancient metabolic pathway.[4] Indeed, the
reactions that constitute glycolysis and its parallel pathway, the pentose
phosphate_pathway, occur metal-catalyzed under the oxygen-free_conditions of
the Archean oceans, also in the absence of enzymes.[5]
In most organisms, glycolysis occurs in the cytosol. The most common type of
glycolysis is the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP pathway), which was discovered by
Gustav_Embden, Otto_Meyerhof, and Jakub_Karol_Parnas. Glycolysis also refers to
other pathways, such as the EntnerâDoudoroff_pathway and various
heterofermentative and homofermentative pathways. However, the discussion here
will be limited to the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway.[6]
The glycolysis pathway can be separated into two phases:[2]
   1. The Preparatory/Investment Phase – wherein ATP is consumed.
   2. The Pay Off Phase – wherein ATP is produced.

The overall reaction of glycolysis is:

The use of symbols in this equation makes it appear unbalanced with respect to
oxygen atoms, hydrogen atoms, and charges. Atom balance is maintained by the
two phosphate (Pi) groups:[7]
    * Each exists in the form of a hydrogen_phosphate anion (HPO42â),
      dissociating to contribute 2 H+ overall
    * Each liberates an oxygen atom when it binds to an ADP (adenosine
      diphosphate) molecule, contributing 2 O overall
Charges are balanced by the difference between ADP and ATP. In the cellular
environment, all three hydroxyl groups of ADP dissociate into âOâ and H+,
giving ADP3â, and this ion tends to exist in an ionic bond with Mg2+, giving
ADPMgâ. ATP behaves identically except that it has four hydroxyl groups,
giving ATPMg2â. When these differences along with the true charges on the two
phosphate groups are considered together, the net charges of â4 on each side
are balanced.
For simple fermentations, the metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two
molecules of pyruvate has a net yield of two molecules of ATP. Most cells will
then carry out further reactions to 'repay' the used NAD+ and produce a final
product of ethanol or lactic_acid. Many bacteria use inorganic compounds as
hydrogen acceptors to regenerate the NAD+.
Cells performing aerobic_respiration synthesize much more ATP, but not as part
of glycolysis. These further aerobic reactions use pyruvate and NADH + H+ from
glycolysis. Eukaryotic aerobic respiration produces approximately 34 additional
molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule, however most of these are produced
by a vastly different mechanism to the substrate-level_phosphorylation in
glycolysis.
The lower-energy production, per glucose, of anaerobic respiration relative to
aerobic respiration, results in greater flux through the pathway under hypoxic
(low-oxygen) conditions, unless alternative sources of anaerobically oxidizable
substrates, such as fatty acids, are found.

***** History[edit] *****
The pathway of glycolysis as it is known today took almost 100 years to fully
discover.[8] The combined results of many smaller experiments were required in
order to understand the pathway as a whole.
The first steps in understanding glycolysis began in the nineteenth century
with the wine industry. For economic reasons, the French wine industry sought
to investigate why wine sometime turned distasteful, instead of fermenting into
alcohol. French scientist Louis_Pasteur researched this issue during the 1850s,
and the results of his experiments began the long road to elucidating the
pathway of glycolysis.[9] His experiments showed that fermentation occurs by
the action of living microorganisms; and that yeast's glucose consumption
decreased under aerobic conditions of fermentation, in comparison to anaerobic
conditions (the Pasteur_effect).[10]
Eduard Buchner. Discovered cell-free fermentation.
While Pasteur's experiments were groundbreaking, insight into the component
steps of glycolysis were provided by the non-cellular fermentation experiments
of Eduard_Buchner during the 1890s.[11][12] Buchner demonstrated that the
conversion of glucose to ethanol was possible using a non-living extract of
yeast (due to the action of enzymes in the extract).[13] This experiment not
only revolutionized biochemistry, but also allowed later scientists to analyze
this pathway in a more controlled lab setting. In a series of experiments
(1905-1911), scientists Arthur_Harden and William_Young discovered more pieces
of glycolysis.[14] They discovered the regulatory effects of ATP on glucose
consumption during alcohol fermentation. They also shed light on the role of
one compound as a glycolysis intermediate: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.[15]
The elucidation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was accomplished by measuring CO2
levels when yeast juice was incubated with glucose. CO2 production increased
rapidly then slowed down. Harden and Young noted that this process would
restart if an inorganic phosphate (Pi) was added to the mixture. Harden and
Young deduced that this process produced organic phosphate esters, and further
experiments allowed them to extract fructose diphosphate (F-1,6-DP).
Arthur_Harden and William_Young along with Nick Sheppard determined, in a
second experiment, that a heat-sensitive high-molecular-weight subcellular
fraction (the enzymes) and a heat-insensitive low-molecular-weight cytoplasm
fraction (ADP, ATP and NAD+ and other cofactors) are required together for
fermentation to proceed. This experiment begun by observing that dialyzed
(purified) yeast juice could not ferment or even create a sugar phosphate. This
mixture was rescued with the addition of undialyzed yeast extract that had been
boiled. Boiling the yeast extract renders all proteins inactive (as it
denatures them). The ability of boiled extract plus dialyzed juice to complete
fermentation suggests that the cofactors were non-protein in character.[14]
Otto Meyerhof. One of the main scientists involved in completing the puzzle of
glycolysis
In the 1920s Otto_Meyerhof was able to link together some of the many
individual pieces of glycolysis discovered by Buchner, Harden, and Young.
Meyerhof and his team were able to extract different glycolytic enzymes from
muscle_tissue, and combine them to artificially create the pathway from
glycogen to lactic acid.[16][17]
In one paper, Meyerhof and scientist Renate Junowicz-Kockolaty investigated the
reaction that splits fructose 1,6-diphosphate into the two triose phosphates.
Previous work proposed that the split occurred via 1,3-diphosphoglyceraldehyde
plus an oxidizing enzyme and cozymase. Meyerhoff and Junowicz found that the
equilibrium constant for the isomerase and aldoses reaction were not affected
by inorganic phosphates or any other cozymase or oxidizing enzymes. They
further removed diphosphoglyceraldehyde as a possible intermediate in
glycolysis.[17]
With all of these pieces available by the 1930s, Gustav_Embden proposed a
detailed, step-by-step outline of that pathway we now know as glycolysis.[18]
The biggest difficulties in determining the intricacies of the pathway were due
to the very short lifetime and low steady-state concentrations of the
intermediates of the fast glycolytic reactions. By the 1940s, Meyerhof, Embden
and many other biochemists had finally completed the puzzle of glycolysis.[17]
The understanding of the isolated pathway has been expanded in the subsequent
decades, to include further details of its regulation and integration with
other metabolic pathways.

The first step in glycolysis is phosphorylation of glucose by a family of
enzymes called hexokinases to form glucose_6-phosphate (G6P). This reaction
consumes ATP, but it acts to keep the glucose concentration low, promoting
continuous transport of glucose into the cell through the plasma membrane
transporters. In addition, it blocks the glucose from leaking out – the cell
lacks transporters for G6P, and free diffusion out of the cell is prevented due
to the charged nature of G6P. Glucose may alternatively be formed from the
phosphorolysis or hydrolysis of intracellular starch or glycogen.
In animals, an isozyme of hexokinase called glucokinase is also used in the
liver, which has a much lower affinity for glucose (Km in the vicinity of
normal glycemia), and differs in regulatory properties. The different substrate
affinity and alternate regulation of this enzyme are a reflection of the role
of the liver in maintaining blood sugar levels.

G6P is then rearranged into fructose_6-phosphate (F6P) by glucose_phosphate
isomerase. Fructose can also enter the glycolytic pathway by phosphorylation at
this point.
The change in structure is an isomerization, in which the G6P has been
converted to F6P. The reaction requires an enzyme, phosphoglucose isomerase, to
proceed. This reaction is freely reversible under normal cell conditions.
However, it is often driven forward because of a low concentration of F6P,
which is constantly consumed during the next step of glycolysis. Under
conditions of high F6P concentration, this reaction readily runs in reverse.
This phenomenon can be explained through Le_Chatelier's_Principle.
Isomerization to a keto sugar is necessary for carbanion stabilization in the
fourth reaction step (below).

The energy expenditure of another ATP in this step is justified in 2 ways: The
glycolytic process (up to this step) becomes irreversible, and the energy
supplied destabilizes the molecule. Because the reaction catalyzed by
Phosphofructokinase_1 (PFK-1) is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP (an
energetically favorable step) it is, in essence, irreversible, and a different
pathway must be used to do the reverse conversion during gluconeogenesis. This
makes the reaction a key regulatory point (see below). This is also the rate-
limiting step.
Furthermore, the second phosphorylation event is necessary to allow the
formation of two charged groups (rather than only one) in the subsequent step
of glycolysis, ensuring the prevention of free diffusion of substrates out of
the cell.
The same reaction can also be catalyzed by pyrophosphate-dependent
phosphofructokinase (PFP or PPi-PFK), which is found in most plants, some
bacteria, archea, and protists, but not in animals. This enzyme uses
pyrophosphate (PPi) as a phosphate donor instead of ATP. It is a reversible
reaction, increasing the flexibility of glycolytic metabolism.[19] A rarer ADP-
dependent PFK enzyme variant has been identified in archaean species.[20]

Destabilizing the molecule in the previous reaction allows the hexose ring to
be split by aldolase into two triose sugars: dihydroxyacetone_phosphate (a
ketose), and glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate (an aldose). There are two classes of
aldolases: class I aldolases, present in animals and plants, and class II
aldolases, present in fungi and bacteria; the two classes use different
mechanisms in cleaving the ketose ring.
Electrons delocalized in the carbon-carbon bond cleavage associate with the
alcohol group. The resulting carbanion is stabilized by the structure of the
carbanion itself via resonance charge distribution and by the presence of a
charged ion prosthetic group.

Triosephosphate_isomerase rapidly interconverts dihydroxyacetone phosphate with
glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate (GADP) that proceeds further into glycolysis. This
is advantageous, as it directs dihydroxyacetone phosphate down the same pathway
as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, simplifying regulation.
**** Pay-off phase[edit] ****
The second half of glycolysis is known as the pay-off phase, characterised by a
net gain of the energy-rich molecules ATP and NADH.[2] Since glucose leads to
two triose sugars in the preparatory phase, each reaction in the pay-off phase
occurs twice per glucose molecule. This yields 2 NADH molecules and 4 ATP
molecules, leading to a net gain of 2 NADH molecules and 2 ATP molecules from
the glycolytic pathway per glucose.

The aldehyde groups of the triose sugars are oxidised, and inorganic_phosphate
is added to them, forming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.
The hydrogen is used to reduce two molecules of NAD+, a hydrogen carrier, to
give NADH + H+ for each triose.
Hydrogen atom balance and charge balance are both maintained because the
phosphate (Pi) group actually exists in the form of a hydrogen_phosphate anion
(HPO42â),[7] which dissociates to contribute the extra H+ ion and gives a net
charge of -3 on both sides.
Here, Arsenate (AsO43â), an anion akin to inorganic phosphate may replace
phosphate as a substrate to form 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate. This, however, is
unstable and readily hydrolyzes to form 3-phosphoglycerate, the intermediate in
the next step of the pathway. As a consequence of bypassing this step, the
molecule of ATP generated from 1-3_bisphosphoglycerate in the next reaction
will not be made, even though the reaction proceeds. As a result, arsenate is
an uncoupler of glycolysis.[21]

This step is the enzymatic transfer of a phosphate group from 1,3-
bisphosphoglycerate to ADP by phosphoglycerate_kinase, forming ATP and 3-
phosphoglycerate. At this step, glycolysis has reached the break-even point: 2
molecules of ATP were consumed, and 2 new molecules have now been synthesized.
This step, one of the two substrate-level_phosphorylation steps, requires ADP;
thus, when the cell has plenty of ATP (and little ADP), this reaction does not
occur. Because ATP decays relatively quickly when it is not metabolized, this
is an important regulatory point in the glycolytic pathway.
ADP actually exists as ADPMgâ, and ATP as ATPMg2â, balancing the charges at
-5 both sides.

**** Biochemical logic[edit] ****
The existence of more than one point of regulation indicates that intermediates
between those points enter and leave the glycolysis pathway by other processes.
For example, in the first regulated step, hexokinase converts glucose into
glucose-6-phosphate. Instead of continuing through the glycolysis pathway, this
intermediate can be converted into glucose storage molecules, such as glycogen
or starch. The reverse reaction, breaking down, e.g., glycogen, produces mainly
glucose-6-phosphate; very little free glucose is formed in the reaction. The
glucose-6-phosphate so produced can enter glycolysis after the first control
point.
In the second regulated step (the third step of glycolysis),
phosphofructokinase converts fructose-6-phosphate into fructose-1,6-
bisphosphate, which then is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be removed from
glycolysis by conversion into glycerol-3-phosphate, which can be used to form
triglycerides.[22] Conversely, triglycerides can be broken down into fatty
acids and glycerol; the latter, in turn, can be converted into dihydroxyacetone
phosphate, which can enter glycolysis after the second control point.

The change in free energy, ÎG, for each step in the glycolysis pathway can be
calculated using ÎG = ÎGÂ°' + RTln Q, where Q is the reaction_quotient. This
requires knowing the concentrations of the metabolites. All of these values are
available for erythrocytes, with the exception of the concentrations of NAD+
and NADH. The ratio of NAD+_to_NADH in the cytoplasm is approximately 1000,
which makes the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (step 6) more
favourable.
Using the measured concentrations of each step, and the standard free energy
changes, the actual free energy change can be calculated. (Neglecting this is
very common - the delta G of ATP hydrolysis in cells is not the standard free
energy change of ATP hydrolysis quoted in textbooks).

From measuring the physiological concentrations of metabolites in an
erythrocyte it seems that about seven of the steps in glycolysis are in
equilibrium for that cell type. Three of the steps â the ones with large
negative free energy changes â are not in equilibrium and are referred to as
irreversible; such steps are often subject to regulation.
Step 5 in the figure is shown behind the other steps, because that step is a
side-reaction that can decrease or increase the concentration of the
intermediate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. That compound is converted to
dihydroxyacetone phosphate by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase, which is a
catalytically_perfect enzyme; its rate is so fast that the reaction can be
assumed to be in equilibrium. The fact that ÎG is not zero indicates that the
actual concentrations in the erythrocyte are not accurately known.
**** Regulation of the rate limiting enzymes[edit] ****
The four regulatory_enzymes are hexokinase (or glucokinase in the liver),
phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate_kinase. The flux through the glycolytic
pathway is adjusted in response to conditions both inside and outside the cell.
The internal factors that regulate glycolysis do so primarily to provide ATP in
adequate quantities for the cellâs needs. The external factors act primarily
on the liver, fat_tissue, and muscles, which can remove large quantities of
glucose from the blood after meals (thus preventing hyperglycemia by storing
the excess glucose as fat or glycogen, depending on the tissue type). The liver
is also capable of releasing glucose into the blood between meals, during
fasting, and exercise thus preventing hypoglycemia by means of glycogenolysis
and gluconeogenesis. These latter reactions coincide with the halting of
glycolysis in the liver.
In animals, regulation of blood glucose levels by the pancreas in conjunction
with the liver is a vital part of homeostasis. The beta_cells in the pancreatic
islets are sensitive to the blood glucose concentration.[25] A rise in the
blood glucose concentration causes them to release insulin into the blood,
which has an effect particularly on the liver, but also on fat and muscle
cells, causing these tissues to remove glucose from the blood. When the blood
sugar falls the pancreatic beta cells cease insulin production, but, instead,
stimulate the neighboring pancreatic alpha_cells to release glucagon into the
blood.[25] This, in turn, causes the liver to release glucose into the blood by
breaking down stored glycogen, and by means of gluconeogenesis. If the fall in
the blood glucose level is particularly rapid or severe, other glucose sensors
cause the release of epinephrine from the adrenal_glands into the blood. This
has the same action as glucagon on glucose metabolism, but its effect is more
pronounced.[25] In the liver glucagon and epinephrine cause the phosphorylation
of the key, rate limiting enzymes of glycolysis, fatty_acid_synthesis,
cholesterol_synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis. Insulin has the
opposite effect on these enzymes.[26] The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
of these enzymes (ultimately in response to the glucose level in the blood) is
the dominant manner by which these pathways are controlled in the liver, fat,
and muscle cells. Thus the phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase inhibits
glycolysis, whereas its dephosphorylation through the action of insulin
stimulates glycolysis.[26]
In addition hexokinase and glucokinase act independently of the hormonal
effects as controls at the entry points of glucose into the cells of different
tissues. Hexokinase responds to the glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) level in the
cell, or, in the case of glucokinase, to the blood sugar level in the blood to
impart entirely intracellular controls of the glycolytic pathway in different
tissues (see below).[26]
When glucose has been converted into G6P by hexokinase or glucokinase, it can
either be converted to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) for conversion to glycogen, or
it is alternatively converted by glycolysis to pyruvate, which enters the
mitochondrion where it is converted into acetyl-CoA and then into citrate.
Excess citrate is exported from the mitochondrion back into the cytosol, where
ATP_citrate_lyase regenerates acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate (OAA). The acetyl-CoA
is then used for fatty_acid_synthesis and cholesterol_synthesis, two important
ways of utilizing excess glucose when its concentration is high in blood. The
rate limiting enzymes catalyzing these reactions perform these functions when
they have been dephosphorylated through the action of insulin on the liver
cells. Between meals, during fasting, exercise or hypoglycemia, glucagon and
epinephrine are released into the blood. This causes liver glycogen to be
converted back to G6P, and then converted to glucose by the liver-specific
enzyme glucose_6-phosphatase and released into the blood. Glucagon and
epinephrine also stimulate gluconeogenesis, which coverts non-carbohydrate
substrates into G6P, which joins the G6P derived from glycogen, or substitutes
for it when the liver glycogen store have been depleted. This is critical for
brain function, since the brain utilizes glucose as an energy source under most
conditions.[27] The simultaneously phosphorylation of, particularly,
phosphofructokinase, but also, to a certain extent pyruvate_kinase, prevents
glycolysis occurring at the same time as gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
*** Hexokinase and glucokinase[edit] ***
Yeast hexokinase B (PDB: 1IG8​)
All cells contain the enzyme hexokinase, which catalyzes the conversion of
glucose that has entered the cell into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Since the
cell membrane is impervious to G6P, hexokinase essentially acts to transport
glucose into the cells from which it can then no longer escape. Hexokinase is
inhibited by high levels of G6P in the cell. Thus the rate of entry of glucose
into cells partially depends on how fast G6P can be disposed of by glycolysis,
and by glycogen_synthesis (in the cells which store glycogen, namely liver and
muscles).[26][28]
Glucokinase, unlike hexokinase, is not inhibited by G6P. It occurs in liver
cells, and will only phosphorylate the glucose entering the cell to form
glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), when the sugar in the blood is abundant. This being
the first step in the glycolytic pathway in the liver, it therefore imparts an
additional layer of control of the glycolytic pathway in this organ.[26]
*** Phosphofructokinase[edit] ***
Bacillus_stearothermophilus phosphofructokinase (PDB: 6PFK​)
Phosphofructokinase is an important control point in the glycolytic pathway,
since it is one of the irreversible steps and has key allosteric effectors, AMP
and fructose_2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP).
Fructose_2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) is a very potent activator of
phosphofructokinase (PFK-1) that is synthesized when F6P is phosphorylated by a
second phosphofructokinase (PFK2). In the liver, when blood sugar is low and
glucagon elevates cAMP, PFK2 is phosphorylated by protein_kinase_A. The
phosphorylation inactivates PFK2, and another domain on this protein becomes
active as fructose_bisphosphatase-2, which converts F2,6BP back to F6P. Both
glucagon and epinephrine cause high levels of cAMP in the liver. The result of
lower levels of liver fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is a decrease in activity of
phosphofructokinase and an increase in activity of fructose_1,6-bisphosphatase,
so that gluconeogenesis (in essence, "glycolysis in reverse") is favored. This
is consistent with the role of the liver in such situations, since the response
of the liver to these hormones is to release glucose to the blood.
ATP competes with AMP for the allosteric effector site on the PFK enzyme. ATP
concentrations in cells are much higher than those of AMP, typically 100-fold
higher,[29] but the concentration of ATP does not change more than about 10%
under physiological conditions, whereas a 10% drop in ATP results in a 6-fold
increase in AMP.[30] Thus, the relevance of ATP as an allosteric effector is
questionable. An increase in AMP is a consequence of a decrease in energy
charge in the cell.
Citrate inhibits phosphofructokinase when tested in vitro by enhancing the
inhibitory effect of ATP. However, it is doubtful that this is a meaningful
effect in vivo, because citrate in the cytosol is utilized mainly for
conversion to acetyl-CoA for fatty_acid and cholesterol synthesis.
TIGAR, a p53 induced enzyme, is responsible for the regulation of
Phosphofructokinase and acts to protect against oxidative stress.[31] TIGAR is
a single enzyme with dual function that regulates F2,6BP. It can behave as a
phosphatase (Fructuose-2,6-Bisphosphatase) which cleaves the phosphate at
carbon-2 producing F6P. It can also behave as a kinase (PFK2) adding a
phosphate onto carbon-2 of F6P which produces F2,6BP. In humans, the TIGAR
protein is encoded by C12orf5 gene. The TIGAR enzyme will hinder the forward
progression of glycolysis, by creating a build up of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P)
which is isomerized into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). The accumulation of G6P
will shunt carbons into the pentose phosphate pathway.[32][33]
*** Pyruvate kinase[edit] ***
Yeast pyruvate_kinase (PDB: 1A3W​)
Main article: Pyruvate_kinase
Pyruvate kinase enzyme catalyzes the last step of glycolysis, in which pyruvate
and ATP are formed. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate_group
from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP, yielding one molecule of pyruvate and
one molecule of ATP.
Liver pyruvate kinase is indirectly regulated by epinephrine and glucagon,
through protein_kinase_A. This protein kinase phosphorylates liver pyruvate
kinase to deactivate it. Muscle pyruvate kinase is not inhibited by epinephrine
activation of protein kinase A. Glucagon signals fasting (no glucose
available). Thus, glycolysis is inhibited in the liver but unaffected in muscle
when fasting. An increase in blood sugar leads to secretion of insulin, which
activates phosphoprotein phosphatase I, leading to dephosphorylation and
activation of pyruvate kinase. These controls prevent pyruvate kinase from
being active at the same time as the enzymes that catalyze the reverse reaction
(pyruvate_carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase), preventing a
futile_cycle.
***** Post-glycolysis processes[edit] *****
The overall process of glycolysis is:
      Glucose + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi â 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2 ATP
If glycolysis were to continue indefinitely, all of the NAD+ would be used up,
and glycolysis would stop. To allow glycolysis to continue, organisms must be
able to oxidize NADH back to NAD+. How this is performed depends on which
external electron acceptor is available.
**** Anoxic regeneration of NAD+[edit] ****
One method of doing this is to simply have the pyruvate do the oxidation; in
this process, pyruvate is converted to lactate (the conjugate_base of lactic
acid) in a process called lactic_acid_fermentation:
      Pyruvate + NADH + H+ â Lactate + NAD+
This process occurs in the bacteria involved in making yogurt (the lactic acid
causes the milk to curdle). This process also occurs in animals under hypoxic
(or partially anaerobic) conditions, found, for example, in overworked muscles
that are starved of oxygen. In many tissues, this is a cellular last resort for
energy; most animal tissue cannot tolerate anaerobic conditions for an extended
period of time.
Some organisms, such as yeast, convert NADH back to NAD+ in a process called
ethanol_fermentation. In this process, the pyruvate is converted first to
acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide, and then to ethanol.
Lactic_acid_fermentation and ethanol_fermentation can occur in the absence of
oxygen. This anaerobic fermentation allows many single-cell organisms to use
glycolysis as their only energy source.
Anoxic regeneration of NAD+ is only an effective means of energy production
during short, intense exercise in vertebrates, for a period ranging from 10
seconds to 2 minutes during a maximal effort in humans. (At lower exercise
intensities it can sustain muscle activity in diving_animals, such as seals,
whales and other aquatic vertebrates, for very much longer periods of time.)
Under these conditions NAD+ is replenished by NADH donating its electrons to
pyruvate to form lactate. This produces 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule,
or about 5% of glucose's energy potential (38 ATP molecules in bacteria). But
the speed at which ATP is produced in this manner is about 100 times that of
oxidative phosphorylation. The pH in the cytoplasm quickly drops when hydrogen
ions accumulate in the muscle, eventually inhibiting the enzymes involved in
glycolysis.
The burning sensation in muscles during hard exercise can be attributed to the
release of hydrogen ions during the shift to glucose fermentation from glucose
oxidation to carbon dioxide and water, when aerobic metabolism can no longer
keep pace with the energy demands of the muscles. These hydrogen ions form a
part of lactic acid. The body falls back on this less efficient but faster
method of producing ATP under low oxygen conditions. This is thought to have
been the primary means of energy production in earlier organisms before oxygen
reached high concentrations in the atmosphere between 2000 and 2500 million
years ago (see diagram above right), and thus would represent a more ancient
form of energy production than the aerobic replenishment of NAD+ in cells.
The liver in mammals gets rid of this excess lactate by transforming it back
into pyruvate under aerobic conditions; see Cori_cycle.
Fermentation of pyruvate to lactate is sometimes also called "anaerobic
glycolysis", however, glycolysis ends with the production of pyruvate
regardless of the presence or absence of oxygen.
In the above two examples of fermentation, NADH is oxidized by transferring two
electrons to pyruvate. However, anaerobic bacteria use a wide variety of
compounds as the terminal electron acceptors in cellular_respiration:
nitrogenous compounds, such as nitrates and nitrites; sulfur compounds, such as
sulfates, sulfites, sulfur dioxide, and elemental sulfur; carbon dioxide; iron
compounds; manganese compounds; cobalt compounds; and uranium compounds.
**** Aerobic regeneration of NAD+, and disposal of pyruvate[edit] ****
In aerobic_organisms, a complex mechanism has been developed to use the oxygen
in air as the final electron acceptor.
    * Firstly, the NADH_+_H+ generated by glycolysis has to be transferred to
      the mitochondrion to be oxidized, and thus to regenerate the NAD+
      necessary for glycolysis to continue. However the inner mitochondrial
      membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+.[34] Use is therefore made of
      two âshuttlesâ to transport the electrons from NADH across the
      mitochondrial membrane. They are the malate-aspartate_shuttle and the
      glycerol_phosphate_shuttle. In the former the electrons from NADH are
      transferred to cytosolic oxaloacetate to form malate. The malate then
      traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix,
      where it is reoxidized by NAD+ forming intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate
      and NADH. The oxaloacetate is then re-cycled to the cytosol via its
      conversion to aspartate which is readily transported out of the
      mitochondrion. In the glycerol phosphate shuttle electrons from cytosolic
      NADH are transferred to dihydroxyacetone to form glycerol-3-phosphate
      which readily traverses the outer mitochondrial membrane. Glycerol-3-
      phosphate is then reoxidized to dihydroxyacetone, donating its electrons
      to FAD instead of NAD+.[34] This reaction takes place on the inner
      mitochondrial membrane, allowing FADH2 to donate its electrons directly
      to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) which is part of the electron_transport_chain
      which ultimately transfers electrons to molecular oxygen (O2), with the
      formation of water, and the release of energy eventually captured in the
      form of ATP.
    * The glycolytic end-product, pyruvate (plus NAD+) is converted to acetyl-
      CoA, CO2 and NADH + H+ within the mitochondria in a process called
      pyruvate_decarboxylation.
    * The resulting acetyl-CoA enters the citric_acid_cycle (or Krebs Cycle),
      where the acetyl group of the acetyl-CoA is converted into carbon dioxide
      by two decarboxylation reactions with the formation of yet more intra-
      mitochondrial NADH + H+.
    * The intra-mitochondrial NADH + H+ is oxidized to NAD+ by the electron
      transport_chain, using oxygen as the final electron acceptor to form
      water. The energy released during this process is used to create a
      hydrogen ion (or proton) gradient across the inner membrane of the
      mitochondrion.
    * Finally, the proton gradient is used to produce about 2.5 ATP for every
      NADH + H+ oxidized in a process called oxidative_phosphorylation.[34]
**** Conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol[edit] ****
The pyruvate produced by glycolysis is an important intermediary in the
conversion of carbohydrates into fatty_acids and cholesterol.[35] This occurs
via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However,
this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of
fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain
cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with
oxaloacetate) is removed from the citric_acid_cycle and carried across the
inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol.[35] There it is cleaved by ATP
citrate_lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is returned to
mitochondrion as malate (and then back into oxaloacetate to transfer more
acetyl-CoA out of the mitochondrion). The cytosolic acetyl-CoA can be
carboxylated by acetyl-CoA_carboxylase into malonyl_CoA, the first committed
step in the synthesis_of_fatty_acids, or it can be combined with acetoacetyl-
CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) which is the rate limiting
step controlling the synthesis_of_cholesterol.[36] Cholesterol can be used as
is, as a structural component of cellular membranes, or it can be used to
synthesize the steroid_hormones, bile_salts, and vitamin_D.[28][35][36]
**** Conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetate for the citric acid cycle[edit]
****
Pyruvate molecules produced by glycolysis are actively_transported across the
inner mitochondrial membrane, and into the matrix where they can either be
oxidized and combined with coenzyme_A to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH,[28] or
they can be carboxylated (by pyruvate_carboxylase) to form oxaloacetate. This
latter reaction "fills up" the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle,
and is therefore an anaplerotic_reaction (from the Greek meaning to "fill up"),
increasing the cycleâs capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the tissue's
energy needs (e.g. in heart and skeletal_muscle) are suddenly increased by
activity.[37] In the citric_acid_cycle all the intermediates (e.g. citrate,
iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate)
are regenerated during each turn of the cycle. Adding more of any of these
intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount
is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is
converted into the other. Hence the addition of oxaloacetate greatly increases
the amounts of all the citric acid intermediates, thereby increasing the
cycle's capacity to metabolize acetyl CoA, converting its acetate component
into CO2 and water, with the release of enough energy to form 11 ATP and 1 GTP
molecule for each additional molecule of acetyl CoA that combines with
oxaloacetate in the cycle.[37]
To cataplerotically remove oxaloacetate from the citric cycle, malate can be
transported from the mitochondrion into the cytoplasm, decreasing the amount of
oxaloacetate that can be regenerated.[37] Furthermore, citric acid
intermediates are constantly_used_to_form_a_variety_of_substances_such_as_the
purines,_pyrimidines_and_porphyrins.[37]

***** Intermediates for other pathways[edit] *****
This article concentrates on the catabolic role of glycolysis with regard to
converting potential chemical energy to usable chemical energy during the
oxidation of glucose to pyruvate. Many of the metabolites in the glycolytic
pathway are also used by anabolic pathways, and, as a consequence, flux through
the pathway is critical to maintain a supply of carbon skeletons for
biosynthesis.
The following metabolic pathways are all strongly reliant on glycolysis as a
source of metabolites: and many more.
    * Pentose_phosphate_pathway, which begins with the dehydrogenation of
      glucose-6-phosphate, the first intermediate to be produced by glycolysis,
      produces various pentose sugars, and NADPH for the synthesis of fatty
      acids and cholesterol.
    * Glycogen_synthesis also starts with glucose-6-phosphate at the beginning
      of the glycolytic pathway.
    * Glycerol, for the formation of triglycerides and phospholipids, is
      produced from the glycolytic intermediate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
    * Various post-glycolytic pathways:
          * Fatty_acid_synthesis
          * Cholesterol_synthesis
          * The citric_acid_cycle which in turn leads to:
                * Amino_acid_synthesis
                * Nucleotide_synthesis
                * Tetrapyrrole_synthesis
Although gluconeogenesis and glycolysis share many intermediates the one is not
functionally a branch or tributary of the other. There are two regulatory steps
in both pathways which, when active in the one pathway, are automatically
inactive in the other. The two processes can therefore not be simultaneously
active.[38] Indeed, if both sets of reactions were highly active at the same
time the net result would be the hydrolysis of four high energy phosphate bonds
(two ATP and two GTP) per reaction cycle.[38]
NAD+ is the oxidizing agent in glycolysis, as it is in most other energy
yielding metabolic reactions (e.g. beta-oxidation of fatty acids, and during
the citric_acid_cycle). The NADH thus produced is primarily used to ultimately
transfer electrons to O2 to produce water, or, when O2 is not available, to
produced compounds such as lactate or ethanol (see Anoxic regeneration of NAD+
above). NADH is rarely used for synthetic processes, the notable exception
being gluconeogenesis. During fatty_acid and cholesterol_synthesis the reducing
agent is NADPH. This difference exemplifies a general principle that NADPH is
consumed during biosynthetic reactions, whereas NADH is generated in energy-
yielding reactions.[38] The source of the NADPH is two-fold. When malate is
oxidatively decarboxylated by âNADP+-linked malic enzyme" pyruvate, CO2 and
NADPH are formed. NADPH is also formed by the pentose_phosphate_pathway which
converts glucose into ribose, which can be used in synthesis of nucleotides and
nucleic_acids, or it can be catabolized to pyruvate.[38]
***** Glycolysis in disease[edit] *****
**** Diabetes[edit] ****
Cellular uptake of glucose occurs in response to insulin signals, and glucose
is subsequently broken down through glycolysis, lowering blood sugar levels.
However, the low insulin levels seen in diabetes result in hyperglycemia, where
glucose levels in the blood rise and glucose is not properly taken up by cells.
Hepatocytes further contribute to this hyperglycemia through gluconeogenesis.
Glycolysis in hepatocytes controls hepatic glucose production, and when glucose
is overproduced by the liver without having a means of being broken down by the
body, hyperglycemia results.[39]
**** Genetic diseases[edit] ****
Glycolytic mutations are generally rare due to importance of the metabolic
pathway, this means that the majority of occurring mutations result in an
inability for the cell to respire, and therefore cause the death of the cell at
an early stage. However, some mutations are seen with one notable example being
Pyruvate_kinase_deficiency, leading to chronic hemolytic anemia.
**** Cancer[edit] ****
Malignant tumor cells perform glycolysis at a rate that is ten times faster
than their noncancerous tissue counterparts.[40] During their genesis, limited
capillary support often results in hypoxia (decreased O2 supply) within the
tumor cells. Thus, these cells rely on anaerobic metabolic processes such as
glycolysis for ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Some tumor cells overexpress
specific glycolytic enzymes which result in higher rates of glycolysis.[41]
Often these enzymes are Isoenzymes, of traditional glycolysis enzymes, that
vary in their susceptibility to traditional feedback inhibition. The increase
in glycolytic activity ultimately counteracts the effects of hypoxia by
generating sufficient ATP from this anaerobic pathway.[42] This phenomenon was
first described in 1930 by Otto_Warburg and is referred to as the Warburg
effect. The Warburg_hypothesis claims that cancer is primarily caused by
dysfunctionality in mitochondrial metabolism, rather than because of the
uncontrolled growth of cells. A number of theories have been advanced to
explain the Warburg effect. One such theory suggests that the increased
glycolysis is a normal protective process of the body and that malignant change
could be primarily caused by energy metabolism.[43]
This high glycolysis rate has important medical applications, as high aerobic
glycolysis by malignant tumors is utilized clinically to diagnose and monitor
treatment responses of cancers by imaging uptake of 2-18F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)
(a radioactive modified hexokinase substrate) with positron_emission_tomography
(PET).[44][45]
There is ongoing research to affect mitochondrial metabolism and treat cancer
by reducing glycolysis and thus starving cancerous cells in various new ways,
including a ketogenic_diet.[46][47][48]
