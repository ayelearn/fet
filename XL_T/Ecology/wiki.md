Ecology addresses the full scale of life, from tiny bacteria to processes that
span the entire planet. Ecologists study many diverse and complex_relations
among species, such as predation and pollination. The diversity of life is
organized into different habitats, from terrestrial (middle) to aquatic
ecosystems.
Ecology (from Greek: Î¿á¼¶ÎºÎ¿Ï, "house", or "environment"; -Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±,
"study of")[A] is the branch of biology[1] which studies the interactions among
organisms and their environment. Objects of study include interactions of
organisms that include biotic and abiotic_components of their environment.
Topics of interest include the biodiversity, distribution, biomass, and
populations of organisms, as well as cooperation and competition within and
between species. Ecosystems are dynamically interacting systems of organisms,
the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their
environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary_production, pedogenesis,
nutrient_cycling, and niche_construction, regulate the flux of energy and
matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with
specific life history traits. Biodiversity means the varieties of species,
genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem_services.
Ecology is not synonymous with environmentalism, natural history, or
environmental_science. It overlaps with the closely related sciences of
evolutionary_biology, genetics, and ethology. An important focus for ecologists
is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological
function. Ecologists seek to explain:
    * Life processes, interactions, and adaptations
    * The movement of materials and energy through living communities
    * The successional development of ecosystems
    * The abundance and distribution of organisms and biodiversity in the
      context of the environment.
Ecology has practical applications in conservation_biology, wetland management,
natural_resource_management (agroecology, agriculture, forestry, agroforestry,
fisheries), city planning (urban_ecology), community_health, economics, basic
and applied_science, and human social interaction (human_ecology). For example,
the Circles_of_Sustainability approach treats ecology as more than the
environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms
(including humans) and resources compose ecosystems which, in turn, maintain
biophysical feedback mechanisms that moderate processes acting on living
(biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain
life-supporting functions and produce natural_capital like biomass_production
(food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of climate, global
biogeochemical_cycles, water_filtration, soil_formation, erosion control, flood
protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical,
economic, or intrinsic value.
The word "ecology" ("Ãkologie") was coined in 1866 by the German scientist
Ernst_Haeckel. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in
philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics.[2] Ancient Greek
philosophers such as Hippocrates and Aristotle laid the foundations of ecology
in their studies on natural_history. Modern ecology became a much more rigorous
science in the late 19th century. Evolutionary concepts relating to adaptation
and natural_selection became the cornerstones of modern ecological_theory.

***** Levels, scope, and scale of organization[edit] *****
The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of
organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g.,
biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and
interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into
populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems
are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are
always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take
thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional
stages of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A
single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest
ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it.[3] Several
generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single
leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities.[4]
The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by
knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern
is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an
integrated whole.[5] Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective
properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole,
such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births
over a designated time frame.[6]
The main subdisciplines of ecology, population (or community) ecology and
ecosystem_ecology, exhibit a difference not only of scale, but also of two
contrasting paradigms in the field. The former focus on organisms' distribution
and abundance, while the later focus on materials and energy fluxes.[7]
**** Hierarchy[edit] ****
See also: Biological_organisation and Biological_classification
System behaviors must first be arrayed into different levels of organization.
Behaviors corresponding to higher levels occur at slow rates. Conversely, lower
organizational levels exhibit rapid rates. For example, individual tree leaves
respond rapidly to momentary changes in light intensity, CO2 concentration, and
the like. The growth of the tree responds more slowly and integrates these
short-term changes.
O'Neill et al. (1986)[8]:76
The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as
aphids migrating on a single tree, while at the same time remain open with
regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence,
ecologists classify ecosystems hierarchically by analyzing data collected from
finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types,
and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform
organization and processes that operate on local to regional, landscape, and
chronological scales.
To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the
biological world is organized into a nested_hierarchy, ranging in scale from
genes, to cells, to tissues, to organs, to organisms, to species, to
populations, to communities, to ecosystems, to biomes, and up to the level of
the biosphere.[9] This framework forms a panarchy[10] and exhibits non-linear
behaviors; this means that "effect and cause are disproportionate, so that
small changes to critical variables, such as the number of nitrogen_fixers, can
lead to disproportionate, perhaps irreversible, changes in the system
properties."[11]:14
**** Biodiversity[edit] ****
Main article: Biodiversity
Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes. It includes the
variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, the
communities and ecosystems in which they occur, and the ecological and
evolutionary processes that keep them functioning, yet ever changing and
adapting.
Noss & Carpenter (1994)[12]:5
Biodiversity (an abbreviation of "biological diversity") describes the
diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological
organization. The term has several interpretations, and there are many ways to
index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization.[13][14]
[15] Biodiversity includes species_diversity, ecosystem_diversity, and genetic
diversity and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects
the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective
levels.[14][16][17] Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem_services
which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life.[15][18][19]
Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches
and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity.
Natural_capital that supports populations is critical for maintaining ecosystem
services[20][21] and species migration (e.g., riverine fish runs and avian
insect control) has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service
losses are experienced.[22] An understanding of biodiversity has practical
applications for species and ecosystem-level conservation planners as they make
management recommendations to consulting firms, governments, and industry.[23]
**** Habitat[edit] ****
Main article: Habitat
Biodiversity of a coral_reef. Corals adapt to and modify their environment by
forming calcium_carbonate skeletons. This provides growing conditions for
future generations and forms a habitat for many other species.[24]
Long-tailed_broadbill building its nest
The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is
known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result.[25] More
specifically, "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that
are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic
environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the
environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly
(e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal."[26]:745 For example,
a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further
categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important
evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the
habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one
population of a species of tropical lizard (Tropidurus hispidus) has a
flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The
population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its
flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the
developmental life_history of amphibians, and in insects that transition from
aquatic to terrestrial habitats. Biotope and habitat are sometimes used
interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas
the latter applies to a species' environment.[25][27][28]
**** Niche[edit] ****
Main article: Ecological_niche
Termite mounds with varied heights of chimneys regulate gas exchange,
temperature and other environmental parameters that are needed to sustain the
internal physiology of the entire colony.[29][30]
Definitions of the niche date back to 1917,[31] but G._Evelyn_Hutchinson made
conceptual advances in 1957[32][33] by introducing a widely adopted definition:
"the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist
and maintain stable population sizes."[31]:519 The ecological niche is a
central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the
fundamental and the realized niche. The fundamental niche is the set of
environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized
niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a
species persists.[31][33][34] The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more
technically as a "Euclidean hyperspace whose dimensions are defined as
environmental variables and whose size is a function of the number of values
that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has positive
fitness."[35]:71
Biogeographical patterns and range distributions are explained or predicted
through knowledge of a species' traits and niche requirements.[36] Species have
functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is
a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may
influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of
development and environmental expression of traits.[37] Resident species evolve
traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment.
This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly
adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive
exclusion_principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by
living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other.
When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection
reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements.
[38] Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can
stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species
inhabiting species-rich communities.[39] The habitat plus the niche is called
the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological
variables affecting an entire species.[25]
**** Niche construction[edit] ****
Main article: Niche_construction
See also: Ecosystem_engineering
Organisms are subject to environmental pressures, but they also modify their
habitats. The regulatory_feedback between organisms and their environment can
affect conditions from local (e.g., a beaver pond) to global scales, over time
and even after death, such as decaying logs or silica skeleton deposits from
marine organisms.[40] The process and concept of ecosystem_engineering is
related to niche_construction, but the former relates only to the physical
modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary
implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this
causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as:
"organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources
to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic
materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats."[41]:373
The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the
influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The
term "niche construction" is more often used in reference to the under-
appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the
abiotic niche.[29][42] An example of natural selection through ecosystem
engineering occurs in the nests of social_insects, including ants, bees, wasps,
and termites. There is an emergent homeostasis or homeorhesis in the structure
of the nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire
colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature
through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests
themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can
survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic
material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.[6][29][30]
**** Biome[edit] ****
Main article: Biome
Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth's
ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation.
[43] There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes
dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are
limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other
environmental variables. Biomes include tropical_rainforest, temperate
broadleaf_and_mixed_forest, temperate_deciduous_forest, taiga, tundra, hot
desert, and polar_desert.[44] Other researchers have recently categorized other
biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, the human body
is a habitat and a landscape.[45] Microbiomes were discovered largely through
advances in molecular_genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of
microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays a significant
role in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.[46]
**** Biosphere[edit] ****
Main article: Biosphere
See also: Earth's_spheres
The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere: the total sum of
ecosystems on the planet. Ecological_relationships regulate the flux of energy,
nutrients, and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example, the
dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been
affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and
photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology
and evolution of plants and animals.[47] Ecological theory has also been used
to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for
example, the Gaia_hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological
theory.[48] The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback_loop
generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core
temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-
regulating range of tolerance.[49]
**** Population ecology[edit] ****
Main article: Population_ecology
See also: Lists_of_organisms_by_population
Population ecology studies the dynamics of species populations and how these
populations interact with the wider environment.[6] A population consists of
individuals of the same species that live, interact, and migrate through the
same niche and habitat.[50]
A primary law of population ecology is the Malthusian_growth_model[51] which
states, "a population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the
environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant."
[51]:18 Simplified population models usually start with four variables: death,
birth, immigration, and emigration.
An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population,
such as on an island, where immigration and emigration does not take place.
Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that
random processes create the observed data. In these island models, the rate of
population change is described by:
            d &#x2061; N   d &#x2061; T    = b N &#x2212; d N = ( b &#x2212; d
      ) N = r N ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {\operatorname {d} N}{\operatorname
      {d} T}}=bN-dN=(b-d)N=rN,}  [{\frac {\operatorname {d} N}{\operatorname
      {d} T}}=bN-dN=(b-d)N=rN,]
where N is the total number of individuals in the population, b and d are the
per capita rates of birth and death respectively, and r is the per capita rate
of population change.[51][52]
Using these modelling techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was
later transformed into a model known as the logistic_equation:
            d N   d T    = a N  (  1 &#x2212;   N K    )  ,   {\displaystyle
      {\frac {dN}{dT}}=aN\left(1-{\frac {N}{K}}\right),}  [{\frac {dN}
      {dT}}=aN\left(1-{\frac {N}{K}}\right),]
where N is the number of individuals measured as biomass density, a is the
maximum per-capita rate of change, and K is the carrying_capacity of the
population. The formula states that the rate of change in population size (dN/
dT) is equal to growth (aN) that is limited by carrying capacity (1 â N/K).
Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand
demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data
include life_history, fecundity, and survivorship, and these are analysed using
mathematical techniques such as matrix_algebra. The information is used for
managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas.[52][53] In cases where
basic models are insufficient, ecologists may adopt different kinds of
statistical methods, such as the Akaike_information_criterion,[54] or use
models that can become mathematically complex as "several competing hypotheses
are simultaneously confronted with the data."[55]
**** Metapopulations and migration[edit] ****
Main article: Metapopulation
See also: Animal_migration
The concept of metapopulations was defined in 1969[56] as "a population of
populations which go extinct locally and recolonize".[57]:105 Metapopulation
ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in conservation
research.[58] Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of
varying levels of quality,[59] and metapopulations are linked by the migratory
behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of
movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals
from a habitat.[60] Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with
the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial
environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify
in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative
to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an
expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another.
There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging,
territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished
from migration; because, it involves the one way permanent movement of
individuals from their birth population into another population.[61][62]
In metapopulation terminology, migrating individuals are classed as emigrants
(when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites
are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to
places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling
areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal
supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are
unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will
disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental
conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics
over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology.
The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and
colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or
rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation
structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years
and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture
of computer models and field_studies to explain metapopulation structure.[63]
[64]
**** Community ecology[edit] ****
Interspecific interactions such as predation are a key aspect of community
ecology.
Main article: Community_ecology
Community ecology examines how interactions among species and their environment
affect the abundance, distribution and diversity of species within communities.
Johnson & Stinchcomb (2007)[65]:250
Community ecology is the study of the interactions among a collections of
species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the
determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species.
Research in community ecology might measure species_diversity in grasslands in
relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey
dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions
between crabs and corals.
**** Ecosystem ecology[edit] ****
Main article: Ecosystem_ecology
These ecosystems, as we may call them, are of the most various kinds and sizes.
They form one category of the multitudinous physical systems of the universe,
which range from the universe as a whole down to the atom.
Tansley (1935)[66]:299
A riparian_forest in the White_Mountains, New_Hampshire (USA) is an example of
ecosystem_ecology
Ecosystems may be habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a
dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes.
Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials (e.g.
carbon, phosphorus) between different pools (e.g., tree biomass, soil organic
material). Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine the underlying causes of
these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure primary_production (g
C/m^2) in a wetland in relation to decomposition and consumption rates (g C/
m^2/y). This requires an understanding of the community connections between
plants (i.e., primary producers) and the decomposers (e.g., fungi and
bacteria),[67]
The underlying concept of ecosystem can be traced back to 1864 in the published
work of George_Perkins_Marsh ("Man and Nature").[68][69] Within an ecosystem,
organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their
environment to which they are adapted.[66] Ecosystems are complex adaptive
systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns
across different scales of time and space.[70] Ecosystems are broadly
categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences
stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the
biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are
technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human
activity.[6]
**** Food webs[edit] ****
Main article: Food_web
See also: Food_chain
Generalized food web of waterbirds from Chesapeake_Bay
A food web is the archetypal ecological_network. Plants capture solar_energy
and use it to synthesize simple_sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow,
they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy
is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified
linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic_species to a top
consumer is called the food_chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food
chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a
type of concept_map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study
pathways of energy and material flows.[8][71][72]
Food webs are often limited relative to the real world. Complete empirical
measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or
a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated
to larger systems.[73] Feeding relations require extensive investigations into
the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult to decipher, or stable
isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a
food web.[74] Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in
understanding community ecosystems.[75]
Food webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of
trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g.,
omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links
(e.g., primary_predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-
random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how
ecological communities remain stable over time.[76] Food webs are composed of
subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and
the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web
stability.[77] Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is
illustrated.[72][78][79][80]
**** Trophic levels[edit] ****
Main article: Trophic_level
A trophic pyramid (a) and a food-web (b) illustrating ecological_relationships
among creatures that are typical of a northern boreal terrestrial ecosystem.
The trophic pyramid roughly represents the biomass (usually measured as total
dry-weight) at each level. Plants generally have the greatest biomass. Names of
trophic categories are shown to the right of the pyramid. Some ecosystems, such
as many wetlands, do not organize as a strict pyramid, because aquatic plants
are not as productive as long-lived terrestrial plants such as trees.
Ecological trophic pyramids are typically one of three kinds: 1) pyramid of
numbers, 2) pyramid of biomass, or 3) pyramid of energy.[6]:598
A trophic level (from Greek troph, ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ®, trophÄ, meaning "food" or
"feeding") is "a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its
energy from the lower adjacent level (according to ecological_pyramids) nearer
the abiotic source."[81]:383 Links in food webs primarily connect feeding
relations or trophism among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be
organized into trophic pyramids, in which the vertical dimension represents
feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain
up toward top predators, and the horizontal dimension represents the abundance
or biomass at each level.[82] When the relative abundance or biomass of each
species is sorted into its respective trophic level, they naturally sort into a
'pyramid of numbers'.[83]
Species are broadly categorized as autotrophs (or primary_producers),
heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are
organisms that produce their own food (production is greater than respiration)
by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed
on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production).[6]
Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups,
including primary_consumers (strict herbivores), secondary_consumers
(carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary
consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators).[84]
Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both
plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater
functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are
relatively inefficient at grazing.[85]
Trophic levels are part of the holistic or complex_systems view of ecosystems.
[86][87] Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped
together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic
view of the system.[88] While the notion of trophic levels provides insight
into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the
prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to
"reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete,
homogeneous trophic levels is fiction."[89]:815 Nonetheless, recent studies
have shown that real trophic levels do exist, but "above the herbivore trophic
level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores."[90]:

A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large
number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of
biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The
many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the
organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone
species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic
dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other
species.[91][92]
Sea_otters (Enhydra lutris) are commonly cited as an example of a keystone
species; because, they limit the density of sea_urchins that feed on kelp. If
sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds
disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure.[93] Hunting
of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction
of the Steller's_sea_cow (Hydrodamalis gigas).[94] While the keystone species
concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been
criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult
to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each
ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not
be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be
applied.[93][95]
***** Ecological complexity[edit] *****
Main article: Complexity
See also: Emergence
Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece
together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of
the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This
biocomplexity stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate
and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as
transitional areas or ecotones spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the
interplay among levels of biological organization as energy, and matter is
integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. "What
were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one."[96]:209 Small scale
patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena, otherwise captured
in the expression (coined by Aristotle) 'the sum is greater than the parts'.
[97][98][E]
"Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types: spatial, temporal,
structural, process, behavioral, and geometric."[99]:3 From these principles,
ecologists have identified emergent and self-organizing phenomena that operate
at different environmental scales of influence, ranging from molecular to
planetary, and these require different explanations at each integrative level.
[49][100] Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems
that transition to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random
fluctuations of history.[10][101] Long-term ecological studies provide
important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of
ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales. These studies are
managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network (LTER).[102] The
longest experiment in existence is the Park_Grass_Experiment, which was
initiated in 1856.[103] Another example is the Hubbard_Brook_study, which has
been in operation since 1960.[104]
**** Holism[edit] ****
Main article: Holism
Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary
ecological studies. Holism addresses the biological_organization of life that
self-organizes into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to
non-reducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole
functional system, such as an ecosystem, cannot be predicted or understood by a
simple summation of the parts.[105] "New properties emerge because the
components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is
changed."[6]:8
Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to reductionistic.[37]
[100][106] Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with
ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical
description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations
may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without
reference to the whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy
whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference
to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has
appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in
the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The
reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to
principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or
understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.[107]
***** Relation to evolution[edit] *****
Main article: Evolutionary_ecology
Ecology and evolutionary biology are considered sister disciplines of the life
sciences. Natural_selection, life_history, development, adaptation,
populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into
ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic
traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the
historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in
different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of
ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and
investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or
the Linnaean_system_of_taxonomy.[108] The two disciplines often appear
together, such as in the title of the journal Trends_in_Ecology_and_Evolution.
[109] There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they
differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and
explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different
spatial or temporal scales of organization.[37][49] While the boundary between
ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and
biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes,[110][111] and evolution
can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.
[112]
**** Behavioural ecology[edit] ****
Main article: Behavioural_ecology
Social display and colour variation in differently adapted species of
chameleons (Bradypodion spp.). Chameleons change their skin colour to match
their background as a behavioural defence mechanism and also use colour to
communicate with other members of their species, such as dominant (left) versus
submissive (right) patterns shown in the three species (A-C) above.[113]
All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour,
including memory and communication.[114] Behavioural ecology is the study of an
organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary
implications. Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in
animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile
phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of
fungi by weevils, the mating dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of
amoeba.[115][116][117][118][119]
Adaptation is the central unifying concept in behavioural ecology.[120]
Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the same way that
eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as
adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive
fitness.[121][122]
Symbiosis: Leafhoppers (Eurymela fenestrata) are protected by ants (Iridomyrmex
purpureus) in a symbiotic relationship. The ants protect the leafhoppers from
predators and in return the leafhoppers feeding on plants exude honeydew from
their anus that provides energy and nutrients to tending ants.[123]
Predator-prey interactions are an introductory concept into food-web studies as
well as behavioural ecology.[124] Prey species can exhibit different kinds of
behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey
species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger
posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms
must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their
life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their
habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on
adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency.[34][110][125]
For example, "[t]he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts
that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and
match their behaviour according to current levels of risk"[126] or "[t]he
optimal flight_initiation_distance occurs where expected postencounter fitness
is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable
by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to
predation risk."[127]
Elaborate sexual displays and posturing are encountered in the behavioural
ecology of animals. The birds-of-paradise, for example, sing and display
elaborate ornaments during courtship. These displays serve a dual purpose of
signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The
displays are driven by sexual_selection as an advertisement of quality of
traits among suitors.[128]
**** Cognitive ecology[edit] ****
Cognitive ecology integrates theory and observations from evolutionary_ecology
and neurobiology, primarily cognitive_science, in order to understand the
effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive
systems and how those systems restrict behavior within an ecological and
evolutionary framework.[129] "Until recently, however, cognitive scientists
have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive
traits evolved under particular natural settings. With consideration of the
selection pressure on cognition, cognitive ecology can contribute intellectual
coherence to the multidisciplinary study of cognition."[130][131] As a study
involving the 'coupling' or interactions between organism and environment,
cognitive ecology is closely related to enactivism,[129] a field based upon the
view that "...we must see the organism and environment as bound together in
reciprocal specification and selection...".[132]
**** Social ecology[edit] ****
Main article: Social_ecology_(academic_field)
Social ecological behaviours are notable in the social_insects, slime_moulds,
social_spiders, human_society, and naked_mole-rats where eusocialism has
evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin
and nest mates[117][122][133] and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin
selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an
altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic
copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including
ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied for this type of relationship
because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every
other male in the colony.[122] In contrast, group_selectionists find examples
of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection
acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if
their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with
predominantly altruistic members survive better than groups with predominantly
selfish members.[122][134]
**** Coevolution[edit] ****
Main article: Coevolution
Bumblebees and the flowers they pollinate have coevolved so that both have
become dependent on each other for survival.
Parasitism: A harvestman arachnid being parasitized by mites. The harvestman is
being consumed, while the mites benefit from traveling on and feeding off of
their host.
Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a host and an associate
relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the
associate.[135] Relationships within_a_species that are mutually or
reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include
fungus-growing_ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the
guts of insects and other organisms, the fig_wasp and yucca_moth pollination
complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with
photosynthetic algae.[136][137] If there is a physical connection between host
and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all
plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular_mycorrhizal
fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for
mineral_nutrients.[138]
Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example, trees
living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the
atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet.
This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the
benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen.[6][139]
If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called
parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to
their reproductive organs or propagules, denying the services of a beneficial
partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and,
thus, becomes difficult to forecast.[140][141] Co-evolution is also driven by
competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner
of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red
Queen_Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize
on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the
evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of
populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.[142][143]
**** Biogeography[edit] ****
Main article: Biogeography
Biogeography (an amalgamation of biology and geography) is the comparative
study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding
evolution of their traits in space and time.[144] The Journal_of_Biogeography
was established in 1974.[145] Biogeography and ecology share many of their
disciplinary roots. For example, the_theory_of_island_biogeography, published
by the Robert MacArthur and Edward_O._Wilson in 1967[146] is considered one of
the fundamentals of ecological theory.[147]
Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial
distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the
explanatory context for biogeographical studies.[144] Biogeographical patterns
result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as
migration and dispersal.[147] and from historical processes that split
populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that
result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern
distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is
called vicariance_biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography.[148]
There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning
ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of
biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious
concern and active area of research in the context of global_warming.[149][150]
*** r/K selection theory[edit] ***
Main article: r/K_selection_theory
A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory,[D] one of the first
predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history_evolution. The
premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures
change according to population_density. For example, when an island is first
colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population
size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources
for rapid population growth. These early phases of population_growth experience
density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection.
As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying
capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available
resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-
dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.[151]
In the r/K-selection model, the first variable r is the intrinsic rate of
natural increase in population size and the second variable K is the carrying
capacity of a population.[34] Different species evolve different life-history
strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-
selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental
investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity.
Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of
insects and invasive_species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a
K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental
investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature.
Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected
characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more
resources into fewer offspring.[146][152]
**** Molecular ecology[edit] ****
Main article: Molecular_ecology
The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates
modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became
more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic
technologies, such as the polymerase_chain_reaction_(PCR). The rise of
molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new
ecological field resulted in the publication Molecular_Ecology in 1992.[153]
Molecular_ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an
evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, John_Avise also played a leading
role in this area of science with the publication of his book, Molecular
Markers, Natural History and Evolution.[154] Newer technologies opened a wave
of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological
or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Molecular
ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological
questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed
previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved
resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical
ecology.[154] For example, molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual
behaviour and multiple male partners in tree_swallows previously thought to be
socially monogamous.[155] In a biogeographical context, the marriage between
genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called
phylogeography.[156]
***** Human ecology[edit] *****
Main article: Human_ecology
The history of life on Earth has been a history of interaction between living
things and their surroundings. To a large extent, the physical form and the
habits of the earth's vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the
environment. Considering the whole span of earthly time, the opposite effect,
in which life actually modifies its surroundings, has been relatively slight.
Only within the moment of time represented by the present century has one
species man acquired significant power to alter the nature of his world.
Rachel Carson, "Silent Spring"[157]
Ecology is as much a biological science as it is a human science.[6] Human
ecology is an interdisciplinary investigation into the ecology of our species.
"Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study
of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems;
(2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and
being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow
different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified
environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human
ecology will most likely address itself to all three."[158]:3 The term was
formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists,
and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems
centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.[158][159]
The ecological complexities human beings are facing through the technological
transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The
unique set of circumstances has generated the need for a new unifying science
called coupled_human_and_natural_systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the
field of human ecology.[105] Ecosystems tie into human societies through the
critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In
recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic
valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of
interest in social-natural_capital, which provides the means to put a value on
the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem_goods
and_services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of
critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and
physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference
function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive
development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world.
Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base
foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for
exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.[105][160][161][162]
**** Restoration and management[edit] ****
Main article: Restoration_ecology
See also: Natural_resource_management
Ecosystem management is not just about science nor is it simply an extension of
traditional resource management; it offers a fundamental reframing of how
humans may work with nature.
Grumbine (1994)[163]:27
Ecology is an employed science of restoration, repairing disturbed sites
through human intervention, in natural resource management, and in
environmental_impact_assessments. Edward O. Wilson predicted in 1992 that the
21st century "will be the era of restoration in ecology".[164] Ecological
science has boomed in the industrial investment of restoring ecosystems and
their processes in abandoned sites after disturbance. Natural resource
managers, in forestry, for example, employ ecologists to develop, adapt, and
implement ecosystem_based_methods into the planning, operation, and restoration
phases of land-use. Ecological science is used in the methods of sustainable
harvesting, disease, and fire outbreak management, in fisheries stock
management, for integrating land-use with protected areas and communities, and
conservation in complex geo-political landscapes.[23][163][165][166]
***** Relation to the environment[edit] *****
Main article: Natural_environment
The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic
attributes. It is dynamically interlinked, and contains resources for organisms
at any time throughout their life cycle.[6][167] Like ecology, the term
environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of
nature. Environment "includes the physical world, the social world of human
relations and the built world of human creation."[168]:62 The physical
environment is external to the level of biological organization under
investigation, including abiotic factors such as temperature, radiation, light,
chemistry, climate and geology. The biotic environment includes genes, cells,
organisms, members of the same species (conspecifics) and other species that
share a habitat.[169]
The distinction between external and internal environments, however, is an
abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are
inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect
between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example,
apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of
metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and
material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the
environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to
conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective
environmental components are understood through reference to their causes;
however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or
holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical
approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but
integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt).
Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the
dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.[37][170]
**** Disturbance and resilience[edit] ****
Main article: Resilience_(ecology)
Ecosystems are regularly confronted with natural environmental variations and
disturbances over time and geographic space. A disturbance is any process that
removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation.
[171] Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as
well as distances and time periods,[172] and are both the cause and product of
natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities
within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal
where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and
opportunity.[171][173][174] Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in
ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting as
a kind of regenerative insurance.[174]
**** Metabolism and the early atmosphere[edit] ****
Metabolism â the rate at which energy and material resources are taken up
from the environment, transformed within an organism, and allocated to
maintenance, growth and reproduction â is a fundamental physiological trait.
Ernest et al.[175]:991
The Earth was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago.[176] As it cooled and
a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by
hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia. Over the next billion
years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture
of carbon_dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. These gases changed the way that
light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat.
There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing_and
oxidizing gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in
turn, the atmosphere also evolved.[177]
The leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis in most plants.
Throughout history, the Earth's atmosphere and biogeochemical_cycles have been
in a dynamic_equilibrium with planetary ecosystems. The history is
characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of
years of stability.[178] The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely
anaerobic methanogen microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric
hydrogen into methane (4H2 + CO2 â CH4 + 2H2O). Anoxygenic_photosynthesis
reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by
converting hydrogen_sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds (for example,
2H2S + CO2 + hv â CH2O + H2O + 2S). Early forms of fermentation also
increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant
atmosphere (the Great_Oxidation) did not begin until approximately
2.4â2.3 billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to
1 billion years prior.[178][179]
**** Radiation: heat, temperature and light[edit] ****
The biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures. Heat is a
form of energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity,
behaviour, and primary_production. Temperature is largely dependent on the
incidence of solar_radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial
variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the
distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different
ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly
to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that
is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external
environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature
by expending metabolic_energy.[110][111][170]
There is a relationship between light, primary production, and ecological
energy_budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's
ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic_energy of different
wavelengths. Radiant_energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of
light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also
acts as a catalyst for genetic_mutation.[110][111][170] Plants, algae, and some
bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis.
Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic
fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophsâresponsible for primary
productionâassimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as
potential_energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds.[110][111][170]
**** Physical environments[edit] ****
*** Water[edit] ***
Main article: Aquatic_ecosystem
Wetland conditions such as shallow water, high plant productivity, and
anaerobic substrates provide a suitable environment for important physical,
biological, and chemical processes. Because of these processes, wetlands play a
vital role in global nutrient and element cycles.
Cronk & Fennessy (2001)[180]:29
Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in
water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming
hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually
completely anoxic where anaerobic_bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also
influences the intensity and spectral_composition of light as it reflects off
the water surface and submerged particles.[180] Aquatic plants exhibit a wide
variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to
survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots
and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient
transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and
photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized
adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and
osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine,
brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic
environments use nitrate, manganese_ions, ferric_ions, sulfate, carbon_dioxide,
and some organic_compounds; other microorganisms are facultative_anaerobes and
use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil
microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction
potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane
(CH4) by methanogenic bacteria.[180] The physiology of fish is also specially
adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation.
Their gills form electrochemical_gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt
water and uptake in fresh water.[181]
*** Gravity[edit] ***
The shape and energy of the land is significantly affected by gravitational
forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth
is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic_plates as well as
influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces
govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological
biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide
directional cues for plant and fungal growth (gravitropism), orientation cues
for animal migrations, and influence the biomechanics and size of animals.[110]
Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are
subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position
and structure of branches and leaves.[182] The cardiovascular_systems of
animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces
that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape),
their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied
(e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).[183]
*** Pressure[edit] ***
Climatic and osmotic_pressure places physiological constraints on organisms,
especially those that fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean
depths.[184] These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the
biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to
atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences.[110] For example, oxygen
levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at
higher altitudes.[185] Water_transportation by plants is another important
ecophysiological process affected by osmotic pressure gradients.[186][187][188]
Water_pressure in the depths of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these
conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are
specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure
differences.[189] Differences between hagfish species provide another example
of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.
[190]
*** Wind and turbulence[edit] ***
The architecture of the inflorescence in grasses is subject to the physical
pressures of wind and shaped by the forces of natural selection facilitating
wind-pollination (anemophily).[191][192]
Turbulent_forces in air and water affect the environment and ecosystem
distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected
by circulation patterns in the global trade_winds. Wind power and the turbulent
forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of
ecosystems.[110] For example, wind running over the surface of a lake creates
turbulence, mixing the water_column and influencing the environmental profile
to create thermally_layered_zones, affecting how fish, algae, and other parts
of the aquatic_ecosystem are structured.[193][194] Wind speed and turbulence
also influence evapotranspiration_rates and energy budgets in plants and
animals.[180][195] Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as
winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the
westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western
North America to produce a rain_shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The
air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is
called orographic_lift and can cause precipitation.[clarification_needed] This
environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species
adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain
valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the
Columbia_Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that
are segregated to the interior mountain systems.[196][197]
*** Fire[edit] ***
Main article: Fire_ecology
Forest fires modify the land by leaving behind an environmental mosaic that
diversifies the landscape into different seral stages and habitats of varied
quality (left). Some species are adapted to forest fires, such as pine trees
that open their cones only after fire exposure (right).
Plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere.
By approximately 350 million years ago (the end of the Devonian_period),
photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17%,
which allowed combustion to occur.[198] Fire releases CO2 and converts fuel
into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many
issues pertaining to its control and suppression.[199] While the issue of fire
in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time,[200]
Charles_Cooper brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to
the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s.[201][202]
Native_North_Americans were among the first to influence fire regimes by
controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the
production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials.[203] Fire creates a
heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient
supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling
establishment.[204][205] Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles.
Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with
forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus_halepensis) cannot germinate until
after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain
compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called
serotiny.[206][207] Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience
of ecosystems.[173]
*** Soils[edit] ***
Main article: Soil_ecology
Soil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the
surface of the planet. It is the chief organizing centre of most ecosystem
functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and
ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the
forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed
into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the
pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into
trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example,
create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively,
these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation.[208][209]
Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders,
mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all
work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite
phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole
community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace
materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and
stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are
influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No
single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from
geomorphological systems in soils.[210][211] Paleoecological studies of soils
places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other
events, such as the evolution_of_trees and the colonization_of_land in the
Devonian period played a significant role in the early development of
ecological trophism in soils.[209][212][213]
*** Biogeochemistry and climate[edit] ***
Main article: Biogeochemistry
See also: Nutrient_cycle and Climate
Ecologists study and measure nutrient budgets to understand how these materials
are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment.[110][111][170] This
research has led to an understanding that there is global feedback between
ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals,
soil, pH, ions, water, and atmospheric gases. Six major elements (hydrogen,
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form
the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's
geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect
of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately
regulate the biogeochemical_cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations
and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has
significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.[214]
The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between
biodiversity and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold
40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and
that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year.[215] There have been
major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history,
regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through
the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in
wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide)
concentrations to levels as high as 3500 ppm.[216]
In the Oligocene, from twenty-five to thirty-two million years ago, there was
another significant restructuring of the global carbon_cycle as grasses evolved
a new mechanism of photosynthesis, C4_photosynthesis, and expanded their
ranges. This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO2
concentrations below 550 ppm.[217] The relative abundance and distribution of
biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such
that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change.
Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance,
biodiversity_loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse
gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is
projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in
weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect
of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting
mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions
are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration
patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate.
Large sections of permafrost are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded
areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane
(CH4) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the
context of the global carbon cycle, because methane is a greenhouse_gas that is
23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO2 on a 100-year
time scale.[218] Hence, there is a relationship between global warming,
decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant
climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.[105][219][220]

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_ecology
**** Early beginnings[edit] ****
By ecology, we mean the whole science of the relations of the organism to the
environment including, in the broad sense, all the "conditions of existence.
"Thus the theory of evolution explains the housekeeping relations of organisms
mechanistically as the necessary consequences of effectual causes and so forms
the monistic groundwork of ecology.
Ernst Haeckel (1866)[224]:140 [B]
Ecology has a complex origin, due in large part to its interdisciplinary
nature.[225] Ancient Greek philosophers such as Hippocrates and Aristotle were
among the first to record observations on natural history. However, they viewed
life in terms of essentialism, where species were conceptualized as static
unchanging things while varieties were seen as aberrations of an idealized
type. This contrasts against the modern understanding of ecological_theory
where varieties are viewed as the real phenomena of interest and having a role
in the origins of adaptations by means of natural_selection.[6][226][227] Early
conceptions of ecology, such as a balance and regulation in nature can be
traced to Herodotus (died c. 425 BC), who described one of the earliest
accounts of mutualism in his observation of "natural dentistry". Basking Nile
crocodiles, he noted, would open their mouths to give sandpipers safe access to
pluck leeches out, giving nutrition to the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the
crocodile.[225] Aristotle was an early influence on the philosophical
development of ecology. He and his student Theophrastus made extensive
observations on plant and animal migrations, biogeography, physiology, and on
their behaviour, giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an
ecological niche.[228][229]
Nowhere can one see more clearly illustrated what may be called the sensibility
of such an organic complex, â expressed by the fact that whatever affects any
species belonging to it, must speedily have its influence of some sort upon the
whole assemblage. He will thus be made to see the impossibility of studying any
form completely, out of relation to the other forms, â the necessity for
taking a comprehensive survey of the whole as a condition to a satisfactory
understanding of any part.
Stephen Forbes (1887)[230]
[Nicola_Perscheid_-_Ernst_Haeckel.jpg] [Warming,Eugen-c1900.jpg]
Ernst_Haeckel (left) and Eugenius_Warming (right), two founders of ecology
Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and
productivity were first developed in the 1700s, through the published works of
microscopist Antoni_van_Leeuwenhoek (1632â1723) and botanist Richard_Bradley
(1688?â1732).[6] Biogeographer Alexander_von_Humboldt (1769â1859) was an
early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize
ecological gradients, where species are replaced or altered in form along
environmental_gradients, such as a cline forming along a rise in elevation.
Humboldt drew inspiration from Isaac_Newton as he developed a form of
"terrestrial physics". In Newtonian fashion, he brought a scientific exactitude
for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the
foundation of a modern ecological law on species-to-area relationships.[231]
[232][233] Natural historians, such as Humboldt, James_Hutton, and Jean-
Baptiste_Lamarck (among others) laid the foundations of the modern ecological
sciences.[234] The term "ecology" (German: Oekologie, Ãkologie) was coined by
Ernst_Haeckel in his book Generelle Morphologie der Organismen (1866).[235]
Haeckel was a zoologist, artist, writer, and later in life a professor of
comparative anatomy.[224][236]
Opinions differ on who was the founder of modern ecological theory. Some mark
Haeckel's definition as the beginning;[237] others say it was Eugenius_Warming
with the writing of Oecology_of_Plants:_An_Introduction_to_the_Study_of_Plant
Communities (1895),[238] or Carl_Linnaeus' principles on the economy of nature
that matured in the early 18th century.[239][240] Linnaeus founded an early
branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature.[239] His works
influenced Charles Darwin, who adopted Linnaeus' phrase on the economy or
polity of nature in The_Origin_of_Species.[224] Linnaeus was the first to frame
the balance_of_nature as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel, who admired Darwin's
work, defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature, which has led some
to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous.[240]
The layout of the first ecological experiment, carried out in a grass garden at
Woburn_Abbey in 1816, was noted by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species. The
experiment studied the performance of different mixtures of species planted in
different kinds of soils.[241][242]
From Aristotle until Darwin, the natural world was predominantly considered
static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little
appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between
organisms, their adaptations, and the environment.[226] An exception is the
1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert_White (1720â1793),
considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology.[243] While
Charles_Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution,[244] he was one
of the founders of soil_ecology,[245] and he made note of the first ecological
experiment in The Origin of Species.[241] Evolutionary theory changed the way
that researchers approached the ecological sciences.[246]
**** Since 1900[edit] ****
Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific
attention toward the end of the 19th century (around the same time that
evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest). The scientist Ellen
Swallow_Richards may have first introduced the term "oekology" (which
eventually morphed into home_economics) in the U.S. as early 1892.[247]
In the early 20th century, ecology transitioned from a more descriptive_form of
natural_history to a more analytical_form of scientific natural history.[231]
[234] Frederic_Clements published the first American ecology book in 1905,[248]
presenting the idea of plant communities as a superorganism. This publication
launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until
the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress
through regular and determined stages of seral_development that are analogous
to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was
challenged by Henry_Gleason,[249] who stated that ecological communities
develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms.
This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of
individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community
associations.[250]
The Clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an
idealistic_form of holism.[37][107] The term "holism" was coined in 1926 by Jan
Christiaan_Smuts, a South African general and polarizing historical figure who
was inspired by Clements' superorganism concept.[251][C] Around the same time,
Charles_Elton pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book Animal
Ecology.[83] Elton[83] defined ecological relations using concepts of food
chains, food cycles, and food size, and described numerical relations among
different functional groups and their relative abundance. Elton's 'food cycle'
was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text.[252] Alfred_J.
Lotka brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to
ecology.
In 1942, Raymond_Lindeman wrote a landmark paper on the trophic_dynamics of
ecology, which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for
its theoretical emphasis. Trophic dynamics became the foundation for much of
the work to follow on energy and material flow through ecosystems. Robert
MacArthur advanced mathematical theory, predictions, and tests in ecology in
the 1950s, which inspired a resurgent school of theoretical mathematical
ecologists.[234][253][254] Ecology also has developed through contributions
from other nations, including Russia's Vladimir_Vernadsky and his founding of
the biosphere concept in the 1920s[255] and Japan's Kinji_Imanishi and his
concepts of harmony in nature and habitat segregation in the 1950s.[256]
Scientific recognition of contributions to ecology from non-English-speaking
cultures is hampered by language and translation barriers.[255]
This whole chain of poisoning, then, seems to rest on a base of minute plants
which must have been the original concentrators. But what of the opposite end
of the food chainâthe human being who, in probable ignorance of all this
sequence of events, has rigged his fishing tackle, caught a string of fish from
the waters of Clear Lake, and taken them home to fry for his supper?
Rachel Carson (1962)[257]:48
Ecology surged in popular and scientific interest during the 1960â1970s
environmental_movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between
ecology, environmental management, and protection.[234] The historical emphasis
and poetic naturalistic writings advocating the protection of wild places by
notable ecologists in the history of conservation_biology, such as Aldo_Leopold
and Arthur_Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it
is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is
located.[234][258] Palamar (2008)[258] notes an overshadowing by mainstream
environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban
health ecology (then called euthenics)[247] and brought about changes in
environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen_Swallow_Richards and Julia
Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental
movements after the 1950s.
In 1962, marine biologist and ecologist Rachel_Carson's book Silent_Spring
helped to mobilize the environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic
pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used
ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and
ecosystem_health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge their
understanding of the degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental
politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.[23][234][258]
