Conservation biology is the management of nature and of Earth's biodiversity
with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from
excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions.[1][2][3]
It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences, and
the practice of natural_resource_management.[4][5][6][7]:478
The conservation_ethic is based on the findings of conservation biology.

***** Origins[edit] *****
The term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with
the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in
Conservation Biology" held at the University_of_California,_San_Diego in La
Jolla, California in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and
Michael_E._SoulÃ© with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and
conservationists including Kurt_Benirschke, Sir Otto_Frankel, Thomas_Lovejoy,
and Jared_Diamond. The meeting was prompted by the concern over tropical
deforestation, disappearing species, eroding genetic_diversity within species.
[8] The conference and proceedings that resulted[2] sought to initiate the
bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the
one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other.[9] Conservation
biology and the concept of biological diversity (biodiversity) emerged
together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and
policy. The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led
to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, conservation
behavior and conservation physiology.[10] It stimulated further development of
conservation_genetics which Otto_Frankel had originated first but is now often
considered a subdiscipline as well.
***** Description[edit] *****
The rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that
conservation biology is often referred to as a "Discipline with a deadline".
[11] Conservation biology is tied closely to ecology in researching the
population_ecology (dispersal, migration, demographics, effective_population
size, inbreeding_depression, and minimum_population_viability) of rare or
endangered_species.[12][13] Conservation biology is concerned with phenomena
that affect the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the
science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population,
species, and ecosystem diversity.[5][6][7][13] The concern stems from estimates
suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within
the next 50 years,[14] which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will
reset the course of evolution on this planet.[15][16]
Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of
biodiversity_loss, species extinctions, and the negative effect these are
having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society.
Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government,
universities, non-profit organizations and industry. The topics of their
research are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with
professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those
dedicated to the cause and profession advocate for a global response to the
current_biodiversity_crisis based on morals, ethics, and scientific reason.
Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through
conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education
programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.[4][5][6][7]
***** History[edit] *****
The conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem. Unless we
solve that problem, it will avail us little to solve all others.
â Theodore Roosevelt[17]
**** Natural resource conservation[edit] ****
Conscious efforts to conserve and protect global biodiversity are a recent
phenomenon.[7][18] Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that
extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity
through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became
necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally
sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the
community.[7] This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management
is often called the "Tragedy_of_the_Commons".[19][20]
From this principle, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based
ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict.[7] For
example, the Alaskan Tlingit peoples and the Haida of the Pacific_Northwest had
resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the
fishing of sockeye_salmon. These rules were guided by clan elders who knew
lifelong details of each river and stream they managed.[7][21] There are
numerous examples in history where cultures have followed rules, rituals, and
organized practice with respect to communal natural resource management.[22]
[23]
The Mauryan emperor Ashoka around 250 B.C. issued edicts restricting the
slaughter of animals and certain kinds of birds, as well as opened veterinary
clinics.
Conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical
writings. There are examples in the Tao, Shinto, Hindu, Islamic and Buddhist
traditions.[7][24] In Greek philosophy, Plato lamented about pasture land
degradation: "What is left now is, so to say, the skeleton of a body wasted by
disease; the rich, soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework
of the district left."[25] In the bible, through Moses, God commanded to let
the land rest from cultivation every seventh year.[7][26] Before the 18th
century, however, much of European culture considered it a pagan_view to admire
nature. Wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised.
[27] However, as early as AD 680 a wildlife_sanctuary was founded on the Farne
Islands by St_Cuthbert in response to his religious beliefs.[7]
**** Early naturalists[edit] ****
White gyrfalcons drawn by John_James_Audubon
Natural_history was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand
expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in Europe and North
America. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in Germany, 250 in
Great_Britain, 250 in the United_States, and 300 in France.[28] Preservationist
or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th
centuries.
Before Charles Darwin set sail on HMS Beagle, most people in the world,
including Darwin, believed in special creation and that all species were
unchanged.[29] George-Louis Leclerc was one of the first naturalist that
questioned this belief. He proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that
species evolve due to environmental influences.[29] Erasmus Darwin was also a
naturalist who also suggested that species evolved. Erasmus Darwin noted that
some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that
have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful
for the species' ancestors.[29] The thinking of these early 18th century
naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century
naturalist.
By the early 19th century biogeography was ignited through the efforts of
Alexander_von_Humboldt, Charles_Lyell and Charles_Darwin.[30] The 19th-century
fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect
rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other
such collectors.[27][28] Although the work of many 18th and 19th century
naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and conservation_organizations,
their writings, by modern standards, showed insensitivity towards conservation
as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections.[28]
**** Conservation movement[edit] ****
Main article: Conservation_movement
The modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century
Enlightenment period particularly in England and Scotland.[27][31] A number of
thinkers, among them notably Lord_Monboddo,[31] described the importance of
"preserving nature"; much of this early emphasis had its origins in Christian
theology.
Scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the
forests of British_India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included
three core principles: that human activity damaged the environment, that there
was a civic_duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and that
scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was
carried out. Sir James_Ranald_Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology,
publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of
damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying
extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in
British_India through the establishment of Forest_Departments.[32]
The Madras Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed
by Alexander_Gibson, a professional botanist who systematically adopted a
forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first
case of state conservation management of forests in the world.[33] Governor-
General Lord_Dalhousie introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest
conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to other
colonies, as well the United States,[34][35][36] where Yellowstone_National
Park was opened in 1872 as the world's first national park.[37]
The term conservation came into widespread use in the late 19th century and
referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural
resources as timber, fish, game, topsoil, pastureland, and minerals. In
addition it referred to the preservation of forests (forestry), wildlife
(wildlife_refuge), parkland, wilderness, and watersheds. This period also saw
the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the
first nature conservation societies. The Sea_Birds_Preservation_Act_of_1869 was
passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world[38] after
extensive lobbying from the Association for the Protection of Seabirds[39] and
the respected ornithologist Alfred_Newton.[40] Newton was also instrumental in
the passage of the first Game_laws from 1872, which protected animals during
their breeding season so as to prevent the stock from being brought close to
extinction.[41]
One of the first conservation societies was the Royal_Society_for_the
Protection_of_Birds, founded in 1889 in Manchester[42] as a protest_group
campaigning against the use of great_crested_grebe and kittiwake skins and
feathers in fur_clothing. Originally known as "the Plumage League",[43] the
group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather
League in Croydon, and formed the RSPB.[44] The National_Trust formed in 1895
with the manifesto to "...promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit
of the nation, of lands, ...to preserve (so far practicable) their natural
aspect." In May 1912, a month after the Titanic sank, banker and expert
naturalist Charles_Rothschild held a meeting at the Natural_History_Museum in
London to discuss his idea for a new organisation to save the best places for
wildlife in the British Isles. This meeting led to the formation of the Society
for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, which later became the Wildlife_Trusts.
In the United_States, the Forest_Reserve_Act_of_1891 gave the President power
to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain. John_Muir
founded the Sierra_Club in 1892, and the New_York_Zoological_Society was set up
in 1895. A series of national_forests_and_preserves were established by
Theodore_Roosevelt from 1901 to 1909.[45][46] The 1916 National Parks Act,
included a 'use without impairment' clause, sought by John Muir, which
eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in Dinosaur
National_Monument in 1959.[47]

In the 20th century, Canadian civil servants, including Charles_Gordon_Hewitt
[48] and James_Harkin spearheaded the movement toward wildlife_conservation.
[49]
**** Global conservation efforts[edit] ****
In the mid-20th century, efforts arose to target individual species for
conservation, notably efforts in big_cat conservation in South_America led by
the New York Zoological Society.[50] In the early 20th century the New York
Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing
preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation
studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as
conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., Carl_E.
Akeley, Archie_Carr and his son Archie Carr III is notable in this era.[51][52]
[citation_needed] Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the Virunga
Mountains and observed the mountain_gorilla in the wild, became convinced that
the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in
persuading Albert_I_of_Belgium to act in defense of the mountain_gorilla and
establish Albert_National_Park (since renamed Virunga_National_Park) in what is
now Democratic_Republic_of_Congo.[53]
By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the Endangered
Species_Act[54] along with the Species_at_Risk_Act (SARA) of Canada,
Biodiversity_Action_Plans developed in Australia, Sweden, the United_Kingdom,
hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United
Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance
to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General
Conference of UNESCO in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644
cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological
conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed
back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act[55] (1966) and National
Environmental_Policy_Act (1970),[56] which together injected major funding and
protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species
research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout
the world. India, for example, passed the Wildlife_Protection_Act_of_1972.[57]
In 1980, a significant development was the emergence of the urban_conservation
movement. A local organization was established in Birmingham, UK, a development
followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although
perceived as a grassroots_movement, its early development was driven by
academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the
movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human
activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable
research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The Society_for
Conservation_Biology originated in 1985.[7]:2
By 1992, most of the countries of the world had become committed to the
principles of conservation of biological diversity with the Convention_on
Biological_Diversity;[58] subsequently many countries began programmes of
Biodiversity_Action_Plans to identify and conserve threatened species within
their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw
increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations
such as the Institute_of_Ecology_and_Environmental_Management and the Society
for_the_Environment.
Since 2000, the concept of landscape_scale_conservation has risen to
prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-
habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most
mainstream conservationists, although concerns have been expressed by those
working to protect some high-profile species.
Ecology has clarified the workings of the biosphere; i.e., the complex
interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment.
The burgeoning_human_population and associated agriculture, industry, and the
ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be
disrupted.[59]
    The last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant:
    "What good is it?" If the land mechanism as a whole is good, then every
âpart is good, whether we understand it or not. If the biota, in the     â
    course of aeons, has built something we like but do not understand,
    then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts? To keep
    every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.

***** Concepts and foundations[edit] *****
**** Measuring extinction rates[edit] ****

labels of the traditional "Big Five" extinction events and the more recently
recognised End-Capitanian_extinction_event are clickable hyperlinks; see
Extinction_event for more details. (source_and_image_info)
Extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways. Conservation biologists
measure and apply statistical_measures of fossil_records,[1][60] rates of
habitat_loss, and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity
as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy[61] to obtain such
estimates.[62] The_Theory_of_Island_Biogeography[63] is possibly the most
significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the
process and how to measure the rate of species extinction. The current
background_extinction_rate is estimated to be one species every few years.[64]
The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most
of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary
greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-
111,700,000)[65] to how many have received a species_binomial (estimated range:
1.5-8 million).[65] Less than 1% of all species that have been described beyond
simply noting its existence.[65] From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23%
of vertebrates, 5% of invertebrates and 70% of plants that have been evaluated
are designated as endangered or threatened.[66][67] Better knowledge is being
constructed by The_Plant_List for actual numbers of species.
**** Systematic conservation planning[edit] ****
Systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify
efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the
highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of
local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the
systematic planning approach:[68]
   1. Compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
   2. Identify conservation goals for the planning region
   3. Review existing conservation areas
   4. Select additional conservation areas
   5. Implement conservation actions
   6. Maintain the required values of conservation areas
Conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for grant
proposals or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify
best management practices (e.g.[69]). Systematic strategies generally employ
the services of Geographic_Information_Systems to assist in the decision making
process.
**** Conservation physiology: a mechanistic approach to conservation[edit] ****
Conservation physiology was defined by Steven_J._Cooke and colleagues as: 'An
integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts, tools, and
knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological
implications; understanding and predicting how organisms, populations, and
ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors; and solving
conservation problems across the broad range of taxa (i.e. including microbes,
plants, and animals). Physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms
to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales, and conservation
includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations,
restore ecosystems, inform conservation policy, generate decision-support
tools, and manage natural resources.'[10] Conservation physiology is
particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate
cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to
population declines.
**** Conservation biology as a profession[edit] ****
The Society_for_Conservation_Biology is a global community of conservation
professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving
biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into
subjects such as philosophy, law, economics, humanities, arts, anthropology,
and education.[5][6] Within biology, conservation_genetics and evolution are
immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance
to the practice and profession of conservation biology.
Conservationists introduce bias when they support policies using qualitative
description, such as habitat_degradation, or healthy ecosystems. Conservation
biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources
and do so with a disclosed combination of science, reason, logic, and values in
their conservation management plans.[5] This sort of advocacy is similar to the
medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are
beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach.
There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership
is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline
that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large.
[70] The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an
adaptive_management approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or
leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority,
and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more
equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward
meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring,
purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring
programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations
such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program.[71]
**** Approaches[edit] ****
Conservation may be classified as either in-situ_conservation, which is
protecting an endangered species in its natural habitat, or ex-situ
conservation, which occurs outside the natural habitat.[72] In-situ
conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ
conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's
natural habitat, such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances
where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat.[72]
Also, non-interference may be used, which is termed a preservationist method.
Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected
existence that halts interference from the humans.[5] In this regard,
conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as
conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both
society and ecosystems. Some preservationists emphasize the potential of
biodiversity in a world without humans.
**** Ethics and values[edit] ****
See also: Conservation_(ethic) and Land_ethic
Conservation biologists are interdisciplinary researchers that practice ethics
in the biological and social sciences. Chan states[73] that conservationists
must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner
by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values.
A conservationist may be inspired by the resource conservation ethic,[7]:15
which seeks to identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the
greatest number of people for the longest time."[5]:13 In contrast, some
conservation biologists argue that nature has an intrinsic_value that is
independent of anthropocentric usefulness or utilitarianism.[7]:3,12,16â17
Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have
a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. Aldo_Leopold was a classical thinker
and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings
are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists.[7]:16â17
**** Conservation priorities[edit] ****

biodiversity (right). Notice that the biomass of social insects (middle) far
outweighs the number of species (right).
See also: Biodiversity_Â§ Benefits_of_biodiversity
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has organized a
global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to
monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction
crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation
through its Red List.[74] The IUCN_Red_List serves as an international
conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation
attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity.[75]
More than the dramatic rates of species loss, however, conservation scientists
note that the sixth mass extinction is a biodiversity crisis requiring far more
action than a priority focus on rare, endemic or endangered_species. Concerns
for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at
ecological processes, such as migration, and a holistic examination of
biodiversity at levels beyond the species, including genetic, population and
ecosystem diversity.[76] Extensive, systematic, and rapid rates of biodiversity
loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of
ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving
holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity. While the conservation
status of species is employed extensively in conservation management,[75] some
scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source
of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species
are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem
services.[77][78]
While most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of
sustaining_biodiversity,[79] there is debate on how to prioritize genes,
species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen,
1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on
endangered species by conserving biodiversity_hotspots, some scientists (e.g)
[80] and conservation organizations, such as the Nature_Conservancy, argue that
it is more cost-effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in
biodiversity coldspots.[81] The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out
the distribution of every species, they argue, is an ill-advised conservation
venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the
ecological roles of species.[76]
Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial
concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on
the Earth's surface. For example, "[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants
and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots
comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."[82]
Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there
are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity. They point out that
emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological
connections to vast areas of the Earth's ecosystems where biomass, not
biodiversity, reigns supreme.[83] It is estimated that 36% of the Earth's
surface, encompassing 38.9% of the worlds vertebrates, lacks the endemic
species to qualify as biodiversity hotspot.[84] Moreover, measures show that
maximizing protections for biodiversity does not capture ecosystem services any
better than targeting randomly chosen regions.[85] Population level
biodiversity (mostly in coldspots) are disappearing at a rate that is ten times
that at the species level.[80][86] The level of importance in addressing
biomass versus endemism as a concern for conservation biology is highlighted in
literature measuring the level of threat to global ecosystem carbon stocks that
do not necessarily reside in areas of endemism.[87][88] A hotspot priority
approach[89] would not invest so heavily in places such as steppes, the
Serengeti, the Arctic, or taiga. These areas contribute a great abundance of
population (not species) level biodiversity[86] and ecosystem_services,
including cultural value and planetary nutrient_cycling.[81]
[IUCN conservation statuses]
Summary of 2006 IUCN_Red_List categories
Those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable
components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are
most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections.
[90] The IUCN_Red_List categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles,
is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are
not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their Wikipedia articles
tend to be ranked low on the importance scale.[dubious  – discuss] This is a
hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns
over population level or biomass.[86][failed_verification] Species richness and
genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability,
ecosystem processes, evolutionary adaptability, and biomass.[91] Both sides
agree, however, that conserving biodiversity is necessary to reduce the
extinction rate and identify an inherent value in nature; the debate hinges on
how to prioritize limited conservation resources in the most cost-effective
way.
**** Economic values and natural capital[edit] ****
Tadrart_Acacus desert in western Libya, part of the Sahara
See also: Ecosystem_services and Biodiversity
Conservation biologists have started to collaborate with leading global
economists to determine how to measure the wealth and services of nature and to
make these values apparent in global_market_transactions.[92] This system of
accounting is called natural_capital and would, for example, register the value
of an ecosystem before it is cleared to make way for development.[93] The WWF
publishes its Living_Planet_Report and provides a global index of biodiversity
by monitoring approximately 5,000 populations in 1,686 species of vertebrate
(mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians) and report on the trends in
much the same way that the stock market is tracked.[94]
This method of measuring the global economic benefit of nature has been
endorsed by the G8+5 leaders and the European_Commission.[92] Nature sustains
many ecosystem_services[95] that benefit humanity.[96] Many of the Earth's
ecosystem_services are public_goods without a market and therefore no price or
value.[92] When the stock market registers a financial crisis, traders on Wall
Street are not in the business of trading stocks for much of the planet's
living natural capital stored in ecosystems. There is no natural stock market
with investment portfolios into sea horses, amphibians, insects, and other
creatures that provide a sustainable supply of ecosystem services that are
valuable to society.[96] The ecological footprint of society has exceeded the
bio-regenerative capacity limits of the planet's ecosystems by about
30 percent, which is the same percentage of vertebrate populations that have
registered decline from 1970 through 2005.[94]
The ecological credit crunch is a global challenge. The Living Planet Report
2008 tells us that more than three-quarters of the world's people live in
nations that are ecological debtors â their national consumption has
outstripped their country's biocapacity. Thus, most of us are propping up our
current lifestyles, and our economic growth, by drawing (and increasingly
overdrawing) upon the ecological capital of other parts of the world.
WWF Living Planet Report[94]
The inherent natural_economy plays an essential role in sustaining humanity,
[97] including the regulation of global atmospheric_chemistry, pollinating
crops, pest_control,[98] cycling_soil_nutrients, purifying our water_supply,
[99] supplying medicines and health benefits,[100] and unquantifiable quality
of life improvements. There is a relationship, a correlation, between markets
and natural_capital, and social_income_inequity and biodiversity loss. This
means that there are greater rates of biodiversity loss in places where the
inequity of wealth is greatest[101]
Although a direct market comparison of natural_capital is likely insufficient
in terms of human_value, one measure of ecosystem services suggests the
contribution amounts to trillions of dollars yearly.[102][103][104][105] For
example, one segment of North_American forests has been assigned an annual
value of 250 billion dollars;[106] as another example, honey-bee pollination is
estimated to provide between 10 and 18 billion dollars of value yearly.[107]
The value of ecosystem services on one New_Zealand island has been imputed to
be as great as the GDP of that region.[108] This planetary wealth is being lost
at an incredible rate as the demands of human society is exceeding the bio-
regenerative capacity of the Earth. While biodiversity and ecosystems are
resilient, the danger of losing them is that humans cannot recreate many
ecosystem functions through technological_innovation.
**** Strategic species concepts[edit] ****
*** Keystone species[edit] ***
Main article: Keystone_species
Some species, called a keystone species form a central supporting hub unique to
their ecosystem.[109] The loss of such a species results in a collapse in
ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species.[5] Keystone
species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of
prey in their ecosystem.[109] The importance of a keystone species was shown by
the extinction of the Steller's_sea_cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) through its
interaction with sea_otters, sea_urchins, and kelp. Kelp_beds grow and form
nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the food_chain.
Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid
decline of sea otters due to overhunting, sea urchin populations grazed
unrestricted on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the
urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the
Steller's sea cow's diet and hastened their demise.[110] The sea otter was
thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological
associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival. However this
was later questioned by Turvey and Risley,[111] who showed that hunting alone
would have driven the Steller's sea cow extinct.
*** Indicator species[edit] ***
Main article: Indicator_species
An indicator species has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore
they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some
animals, such as amphibians with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to
wetlands, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as
a miner's_canary. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture
environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate
human activities.[5] Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine
if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or
modify practice, such as through different forest silviculture treatments and
management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a pesticide may
impart on the health of an ecosystem.
Government regulators, consultants, or NGOs regularly monitor indicator
species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical
considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective.[112] It
is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species,
communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement
that prevents harm to the complex, and often unpredictable, response from
ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997[113]:88â89).
*** Umbrella and flagship species[edit] ***
Main articles: Umbrella_species and Flagship_species
An example of an umbrella species is the monarch_butterfly, because of its
lengthy migrations and aesthetic value. The monarch migrates across North
America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist.
Any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time
umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as
flagship species, which are species, such as the giant_panda, the blue_whale,
the tiger, the mountain_gorilla and the monarch butterfly, that capture the
public's attention and attract support for conservation measures.[5]
Paradoxically, however, conservation bias towards flagship species sometimes
threatens other species of chief concern.[114]
***** Context and trends[edit] *****
Conservation biologists study trends and process from the paleontological past
to the ecological present as they gain an understanding of the context related
to species_extinction.[1] It is generally accepted that there have been five
major global mass extinctions that register in Earth's history. These include:
the Ordovician (440 mya), Devonian (370 mya), PermianâTriassic (245 mya),
TriassicâJurassic (200 mya), and CretaceousâPaleogene_extinction_event (66
mya) extinction spasms. Within the last 10,000 years, human influence over the
Earth's ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty
estimating the number of species lost;[115] that is to say the rates of
deforestation, reef_destruction, wetland_draining and other human acts are
proceeding much faster than human assessment of species. The latest Living
Planet_Report by the World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature estimates that we have exceeded
the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet, requiring 1.6 Earths to support
the demands placed on our natural resources.[116]
**** Holocene extinction[edit] ****
Main article: Holocene_extinction
An art scape image showing the relative importance of animals in a rain forest
through a summary of (a) child's perception compared with (b) a scientific
estimate of the importance. The size of the animal represents its importance.
The child's mental image places importance on big cats, birds, butterflies, and
then reptiles versus the actual dominance of social insects (such as ants).
Conservation biologists are dealing with and have published evidence from all
corners of the planet indicating that humanity may be causing the sixth and
fastest planetary extinction_event.[117][118][119] It has been suggested that
an unprecedented number of species is becoming extinct in what is known as the
Holocene_extinction_event.[120] The global extinction rate may be approximately
1,000 times higher than the natural background extinction rate.[121] It is
estimated that two-thirds of all mammal genera and one-half of all mammal
species weighing at least 44 kilograms (97 lb) have gone extinct in the last
50,000 years.[111][122][123][124] The Global Amphibian Assessment[125] reports
that amphibians_are_declining on a global scale faster than any other
vertebrate group, with over 32% of all surviving species being threatened with
extinction. The surviving populations are in continual decline in 43% of those
that are threatened. Since the mid-1980s the actual rates of extinction have
exceeded 211 times rates measured from the fossil_record.[126] However, "The
current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the
background extinction rate for amphibians."[126] The global extinction trend
occurs in every major vertebrate group that is being monitored. For example,
23% of all mammals and 12% of all birds are Red_Listed by the International
Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature (IUCN), meaning they too are threatened with
extinction. Even though extinction is natural, the decline in species is
happening at such an incredible rate that evolution can simply not match,
therefore, leading to the greatest continual mass extinction on Earth.[127]
Humans have dominated the planet and our high consumption of resources, along
with the pollution generated is affecting the environments in which other
species live.[127][128] There are a wide variety of species that humans are
working to protect such as the Hawaiian Crow and the Whooping Crane of Texas.
[129] People can also take action on preserving species by advocating and
voting for global and national policies that improve climate, under the
concepts of climate_mitigation and climate_restoration. The Earth's oceans
demand particular attention as climate change continues to alter pH levels,
making it uninhabitable for organisms with shells which dissolve as a result.
[121]
**** Status of oceans and reefs[edit] ****
See also: Ocean, Coral_reef, Marine_pollution, and Marine_conservation
Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and
rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had
effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic
"bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in
the world disappeared in less than a year. Coral_bleaching is caused by a
mixture of environmental_stresses, including increases in ocean temperatures
and acidity, causing both the release of symbiotic algae and death of corals.
[130] Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen
dramatically in the past ten years. The loss of coral reefs, which are
predicted to go extinct in the next century, threatens the balance of global
biodiversity, will have huge economic impacts, and endangers food security for
hundreds of millions of people.[131] Conservation biology plays an important
role in international agreements covering the world's oceans[130] (and other
issues pertaining to biodiversity[132]).
These predictions will undoubtedly appear extreme, but it is difficult to
imagine how such changes will not come to pass without fundamental changes in
human behavior.
J.B. Jackson[16]:11463
The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO2 levels.
This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic natural
resources. A concern is that the majority of all marine species will not be
able to evolve or acclimate in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.
[133]
The prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when "[...] 90% of all
of the large (average approximately â¥50 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and
sharks in the ocean"[16] are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of
current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving multi-cellular
organisms with only microbes left to dominate marine_ecosystems.[16]
**** Groups other than vertebrates[edit] ****
Serious concerns also being raised about taxonomic_groups that do not receive
the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates. These
include fungal (including lichen-forming species),[134] invertebrate
(particularly insect[14][135][136]) and plant communities where the vast
majority of biodiversity is represented. Conservation of fungi and conservation
of insects, in particular, are both of pivotal importance for conservation
biology. As mycorrhizal symbionts, and as decomposers and recyclers, fungi are
essential for sustainability of forests.[134] The value of insects in the
biosphere is enormous because they outnumber all other living groups in measure
of species_richness. The greatest bulk of biomass on land is found in plants,
which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects
is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these
aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures.[137][138]
One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the
mysterious case of missing honey_bees (Apis mellifera). Honey bees provide an
indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting
a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become
vastly used throughout the world.[139] The sudden disappearance of bees leaving
empty hives or colony_collapse_disorder (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in 16-
month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 beekeepers across the United
States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden
demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector.
The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. Pests,
pesticides, and global_warming are all being considered as possible causes.
[140][141]
Another highlight that links conservation biology to insects, forests, and
climate change is the mountain_pine_beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic
of British_Columbia, Canada, which has infested 470,000 km2 (180,000 sq mi) of
forested land since 1999.[87] An action plan has been prepared by the
Government of British Columbia to address this problem.[142][143]
     This impact [pine beetle epidemic] converted the forest from a small
     net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and
     immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts
     resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were
     equivalent to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions
     from all of Canada during 1959â1999.
     â Kurz et al.[88]
**** Conservation biology of parasites[edit] ****
Main article: Conservation_biology_of_parasites
A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of
them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most
of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host
populations, or the extinction of host species.
**** Threats to biodiversity[edit] ****
Main article: Biodiversity_threats
Today, many threats to Biodiversity exist. An acronym that can be used to
express the top threats of present-day H.I.P.P.O stands for Habitat Loss,
Invasive Species, Pollution, Human Population, and Overharvesting.[144] The
primary threats to biodiversity are habitat_destruction (such as deforestation,
agricultural_expansion, urban_development), and overexploitation (such as
wildlife_trade).[115][145][146][147][148][149] Habitat_fragmentation also poses
challenges, because the global network of protected areas only covers 11.5% of
the Earth's surface.[150] A significant consequence of fragmentation and lack
of linked_protected_areas is the reduction of animal migration on a global
scale. Considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for
nutrient_cycling across the earth, the reduction of migration is a serious
matter for conservation biology.[151][152]
Human activities are associated directly or indirectly with nearly every aspect
of the current extinction spasm.
Wake and Vredenburg[117]
However, human activities need not necessarily cause irreparable harm to the
biosphere. With conservation_management_and_planning for biodiversity at all
levels, from genes to ecosystems, there are examples where humans mutually
coexist in a sustainable way with nature.[153] Even with the current threats to
biodiversity there are ways we can improve the current condition and start
anew.
Many of the threats to biodiversity, including disease and climate change, are
reaching inside borders of protected areas, leaving them 'not-so protected'
(e.g. Yellowstone_National_Park).[154] Climate_change, for example, is often
cited as a serious threat in this regard, because there is a feedback_loop
between species extinction and the release of carbon_dioxide into the
atmosphere.[87][88] Ecosystems store and cycle large amounts of carbon which
regulates global conditions.[155] In present day, there have been major climate
shifts with temperature changes making survival of some species difficult.[144]
The effects_of_global_warming add a catastrophic threat toward a mass
extinction of global biological diversity.[156] Conservationists have claimed
that not all the species can be saved, and they have to decide which their
efforts should be used to protect. This concept is known as the Conservation
Triage.[144] The extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 37 percent
of all species by 2050,[156] or 50 percent of all species over the next 50
years.[14] The current extinction rate is 100-100,000 times more rapid today
than the last several billion years.[144]

  10. ^ Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between
      genetics and ecology. SoulÃ©, was an evolutionary geneticist working with
      wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance conservation_genetics as a
      new field at the time. Jared_Diamond, who suggested the idea for a
      conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community
      ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and Thomas
      Lovejoy, who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977
      when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at World_Wildlife_Fund,
      felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested
      use of a new term conservation biology, complementing Frankel's
      conception and coining of "conservation genetics", to encompass the
      application of biological sciences in general to conservation.
      Subsequently, SoulÃ© and Wilcox wrote conceived the agenda for the
      meeting they jointly convened on September 6â9, 1978, titled First
      International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology, in which
      the program described "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate
      and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called
      conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights
      and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology,
      sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This
      inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected
      participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities.
