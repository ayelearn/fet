Study of microscopic organisms
An agar_plate streaked with microorganisms
Microbiology (from Greek Î¼á¿ÎºÏÎ¿Ï, mÄ«kros, "small"; Î²Î¯Î¿Ï, bios,
"life"; and -Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±, -logia) is the study of microorganisms, those being
unicellular (single cell), multicellular (cell colony), or acellular (lacking
cells).[1] Microbiology encompasses numerous sub-disciplines including
virology, parasitology, mycology and bacteriology.
Eukaryotic microorganisms possess membrane-bound cell organelles and include
fungi and protists, whereas prokaryotic organismsâall of which are
microorganismsâare conventionally classified as lacking membrane-bound
organelles and include Bacteria and Archaea.[2][3] Microbiologists
traditionally relied on culture, staining, and microscopy. However, less than
1% of the microorganisms present in common environments can be cultured in
isolation using current means.[4] Microbiologists often rely on molecular
biology tools such as DNA sequence based identification, for example 16s rRNA
gene sequence used for bacteria identification.
Viruses have been variably classified as organisms,[5] as they have been
considered either as very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules.
Prions, never considered as microorganisms, have been investigated by
virologists, however, as the clinical effects traced to them were originally
presumed due to chronic viral infections, and virologists took
searchâdiscovering "infectious proteins".
The existence of microorganisms was predicted many centuries before they were
first observed, for example by the Jains in India and by Marcus_Terentius_Varro
in ancient Rome. The first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting
bodies of moulds, by Robert_Hooke in 1666, but the Jesuit priest Athanasius
Kircher was likely the first to see microbes, which he mentioned observing in
milk and putrid material in 1658. Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek is considered a
father_of_microbiology as he observed and experimented with microscopic
organisms in 1676, using simple microscopes of his own design. Scientific
microbiology developed in the 19th century through the work of Louis_Pasteur
and in medical microbiology Robert_Koch.

***** History[edit] *****
Avicenna hypothesized the existence of microorganisms.
The existence of microorganisms was hypothesized for many centuries before
their actual discovery. The existence of unseen microbiological life was
postulated by Jainism which is based on Mahaviraâs teachings as early as 6th
century BCE.[6] Paul Dundas notes that Mahavira asserted the existence of
unseen microbiological creatures living in earth, water, air and fire.[7] Jain
scriptures describe nigodas which are sub-microscopic creatures living in large
clusters and having a very short life, said to pervade every part of the
universe, even in tissues of plants and flesh of animals.[8] The Roman Marcus
Terentius_Varro made references to microbes when he warned against locating a
homestead in the vicinity of swamps "because there are bred certain minute
creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter
the body through the mouth and nose and thereby cause serious diseases."[9]
In the golden age of Islamic civilization, Iranian scientists hypothesized the
existence of microorganisms, such as Avicenna in his book The_Canon_of
Medicine, Ibn_Zuhr (also known as Avenzoar) who discovered scabies mites, and
Al-Razi who gave the earliest known description of smallpox in his book The
Virtuous Life (al-Hawi).[10]
In 1546, Girolamo_Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by
transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or
indirect contact, or vehicle transmission.[11]
Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek, often cited as the first to experiment with
microorganisms.[12][13][14][15]

Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes by Henry_Baker[16]
Martinus_Beijerinck, the founding father of the Delft School of Microbiology,
in his laboratory. Beijerinck is often considered as a founder_of_virology,
environmental_microbiology, and industrial_microbiology.[17]
In 1676, Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek, who lived most of his life in Delft, Holland,
observed bacteria and other microorganisms using a single-lens microscope of
his own design.[18][1] He is considered a father_of_microbiology as he
pioneered the use of simple single-lensed microscopes of his own design.[18]
While Van Leeuwenhoek is often cited as the first to observe microbes, Robert
Hooke made his first recorded microscopic observation, of the fruiting bodies
of moulds, in 1665.[19] It has, however, been suggested that a Jesuit priest
called Athanasius_Kircher was the first to observe microorganisms.[20]
Kircher was among the first to design magic lanterns for projection purposes,
so he must have been well acquainted with the properties of lenses.[20] He
wrote "Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by
Microscope" in 1646, stating "who would believe that vinegar and milk abound
with an innumerable multitude of worms." He also noted that putrid material is
full of innumerable creeping animalcules. He published his Scrutinium Pestis
(Examination of the Plague) in 1658, stating correctly that the disease was
caused by microbes, though what he saw was most likely red or white blood cells
rather than the plague agent itself.[20]
***** The birth of bacteriology[edit] *****
Innovative laboratory_glassware and experimental methods developed by Louis
Pasteur and other biologists contributed to the young field of bacteriology in
the late 19th century.
The field of bacteriology (later a subdiscipline of microbiology) was founded
in the 19th century by Ferdinand_Cohn, a botanist whose studies on algae and
photosynthetic_bacteria led him to describe several bacteria including Bacillus
and Beggiatoa. Cohn was also the first to formulate a scheme for the taxonomic
classification of bacteria, and to discover endospores.[21] Louis_Pasteur and
Robert_Koch were contemporaries of Cohn, and are often considered to be the
father of microbiology[20] and medical_microbiology, respectively.[22] Pasteur
is most famous for his series of experiments designed to disprove the then
widely held theory_of_spontaneous_generation, thereby solidifying
microbiology's identity as a biological science.[23] One of his students,
Adrien Certes, is considered the founder of marine microbiology.[24] Pasteur
also designed methods for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines
against several diseases such as anthrax, fowl cholera and rabies.[1] Koch is
best known for his contributions to the germ_theory_of_disease, proving that
specific diseases were caused by specific pathogenic microorganisms. He
developed a series of criteria that have become known as the Koch's_postulates.
Koch was one of the first scientists to focus on the isolation of bacteria in
pure_culture resulting in his description of several novel bacteria including
Mycobacterium_tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis.[1]
While Pasteur and Koch are often considered the founders of microbiology, their
work did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world
because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical
relevance. It was not until the late 19th century and the work of Martinus
Beijerinck and Sergei_Winogradsky that the true breadth of microbiology was
revealed.[1] Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the
discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment_culture techniques.[25]
While his work on the tobacco_mosaic_virus established the basic principles of
virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most
immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation of a wide
range of microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first
to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential
role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes.[26] He was responsible
for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing
bacteria.[1] French-Canadian microbiologist Felix_d'Herelle co-discovered
bacteriophages in 1917 and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.[27]
Joseph_Lister was the first to use phenol disinfectant on the open wounds of
patients.[28]
***** Branches[edit] *****

Main article: Branches_of_microbiology
The branches_of_microbiology can be classified into applied sciences, or
divided according to taxonomy, as is the case with bacteriology, mycology,
protozoology, and phycology. There is considerable overlap between the specific
branches of microbiology with each other and with other disciplines, and
certain aspects of these branches can extend beyond the traditional scope of
microbiology[29][30] A pure research branch of microbiology is termed cellular
microbiology.
***** Applications[edit] *****
While some fear_microbes due to the association of some microbes with various
human diseases, many microbes are also responsible for numerous beneficial
processes such as industrial_fermentation (e.g. the production of alcohol,
vinegar and dairy_products), antibiotic production and act as molecular
vehicles to transfer DNA to complex organisms such as plants and animals.
Scientists have also exploited their knowledge of microbes to produce
biotechnologically important enzymes such as Taq_polymerase, reporter_genes for
use in other genetic systems and novel molecular biology techniques such as the
yeast_two-hybrid_system.[citation_needed]
Bacteria can be used for the industrial production of amino_acids.
Corynebacterium glutamicum is one of the most important bacterial species with
an annual production of more than two million tons of amino acids, mainly L-
glutamate and L-lysine.[31] Since some bacteria have the ability to synthesize
antibiotics, they are used for medicinal purposes, such as Streptomyces to make
aminoglycoside_antibiotics.[32]
Fermenting tanks with yeast being used to brew beer
A variety of biopolymers, such as polysaccharides, polyesters, and polyamides,
are produced by microorganisms. Microorganisms are used for the
biotechnological production of biopolymers with tailored properties suitable
for high-value medical application such as tissue_engineering and drug
delivery. Microorganisms are for example used for the biosynthesis of xanthan,
alginate, cellulose, cyanophycin, poly(gamma-glutamic acid), levan, hyaluronic
acid, organic acids, oligosaccharides polysaccharide and polyhydroxyalkanoates.
[33]
Microorganisms are beneficial for microbial_biodegradation or bioremediation of
domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes and subsurface pollution in soils,
sediments and marine environments. The ability of each microorganism to degrade
toxic_waste depends on the nature of each contaminant. Since sites typically
have multiple pollutant types, the most effective approach to microbial
biodegradation is to use a mixture of bacterial and fungal species and strains,
each specific to the biodegradation of one or more types of contaminants.[34]
Symbiotic microbial communities confer benefits to their human and animal hosts
health including aiding digestion, producing beneficial vitamins and amino
acids, and suppressing pathogenic microbes. Some benefit may be conferred by
eating fermented foods, probiotics (bacteria potentially beneficial to the
digestive system) or prebiotics (substances consumed to promote the growth of
probiotic microorganisms).[35][36] The ways the microbiome influences human and
animal health, as well as methods to influence the microbiome are active areas
of research.[37]
Research has suggested that microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of
cancer. Various strains of non-pathogenic clostridia can infiltrate and
replicate within solid tumors. Clostridial vectors can be safely administered
and their potential to deliver therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated in a
variety of preclinical models.[38]
