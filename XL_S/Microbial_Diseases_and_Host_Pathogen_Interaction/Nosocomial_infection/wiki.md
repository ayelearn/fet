Specialty Infectious_disease
A hospital-acquired infection (HAI), also known as a nosocomial infection, is
an infection that is acquired in a hospital or other health_care facility. To
emphasize both hospital and nonhospital settings, it is sometimes instead
called a health careâassociated infection (HAI or HCAI).[1] Such an infection
can be acquired in hospital, nursing_home, rehabilitation_facility, outpatient
clinic, or other clinical settings. Infection is spread to the susceptible
patient in the clinical setting by various means. Health care staff also spread
infection, in addition to contaminated equipment, bed linens, or air droplets.
The infection can originate from the outside environment, another infected
patient, staff that may be infected, or in some cases, the source of the
infection cannot be determined. In some cases the microorganism originates from
the patient's own skin microbiota, becoming opportunistic after surgery or
other procedures that compromise the protective skin barrier. Though the
patient may have contracted the infection from their own skin, the infection is
still considered nosocomial since it develops in the health care setting.
In the United States, the Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention estimated
roughly 1.7 million hospital-associated infections, from all types of
microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi combined, cause or contribute to
99,000 deaths each year.[2] In Europe, where hospital surveys have been
conducted, the category of gram-negative infections are estimated to account
for two-thirds of the 25,000 deaths each year.[citation_needed] Nosocomial
infections can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary_tract,
bloodstream and other parts of the body.[3][4] Many types display antimicrobial
resistance, which can complicate treatment.

**** Transmission[edit] ****
In-dwelling_catheters have recently been identified with hospital acquired
infections.[6] To deal with this complication procedures are used, called
intravascular antimicrobial lock therapy that can reduce infections that are
unexposed to blood-borne antibiotics.[7] Introducing antibiotics, including
ethanol, into the catheter (without flushing it into the bloodstream) reduces
the formation of biofilms.[5]
                                Main routes of transmission
Route        Description
Contact      The most important and frequent mode of transmission of nosocomial infections
transmission is by direct contact.
             Transmission occurs when droplets containing microbes from the infected person
Droplet      are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the patient's
transmission body; droplets are generated from the source person mainly by coughing,
             sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures, such
             as bronchoscopy.
             Dissemination can be either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue {5
             Âµm or smaller in size} of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that
             remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles
             containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be
Airborne     dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host
transmission within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient,
             depending on environmental factors; therefore, special air-handling and
             ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Microorganisms
             transmitted by airborne transmission include Legionella, Mycobacterium
             tuberculosis and the rubeola and varicella viruses.
Common       This applies to microorganisms transmitted to the host by contaminated items,
vehicle      such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment.
transmission
Vector_borne This occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin
transmission transmit microorganisms.
Contact transmission is divided into two subgroups: direct-contact transmission
and indirect-contact transmission.
                        Routes of contact transmission
Route                         Description
                              This involves a direct body surface-to-body
                              surface contact and physical transfer of
                              microorganisms between a susceptible host and an
                              infected or colonized person, such as when a
                              person turns a patient, gives a patient a bath,
Direct-contact transmission   or performs other patient-care activities that
                              require direct personal contact. Direct-contact
                              transmission also can occur between two patients,
                              with one serving as the source of the infectious
                              microorganisms and the other as a susceptible
                              host.
                              This involves contact of a susceptible host with
                              a contaminated intermediate object, usually
                              inanimate, such as contaminated instruments,
                              needles, or dressings, or contaminated gloves
                              that are not changed between patients. In
Indirect-contact transmission addition, the improper use of saline flush
                              syringes, vials, and bags has been implicated in
                              disease transmission in the US, even when
                              healthcare workers had access to gloves,
                              disposable needles, intravenous devices, and
                              flushes.[8]
***** Prevention[edit] *****
[Making_Health_Care_Safer-CDC_Vital_Signs-March_2012.pdf]
Controlling nosocomial infection is to implement QA/QC measures to the health
care sectors, and evidence-based management can be a feasible approach. For
those with ventilator-associated or hospital-acquired pneumonia, controlling
and monitoring hospital indoor_air_quality needs to be on agenda in management,
[9] whereas for nosocomial rotavirus infection, a hand_hygiene protocol has to
be enforced.[10][11][12]
To reduce HAIs, the state of Maryland implemented the Maryland Hospital-
Acquired Conditions Program that provides financial rewards and penalties for
individual hospitals based on their ability to avoid HAIs. An adaptation of the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services payment policy causes poor-performing
hospitals to lose up to 3% of their inpatient revenues, whereas hospitals that
are able to avoid HAIs can earn up to 3% in rewards. During the programâs
first 2 years, complication rates fell by 15.26 percent across all hospital-
acquired conditions tracked by the state (including those not covered by the
program), from a risk-adjusted complication rate of 2.38 per 1,000 people in
2009 to a rate of 2.02 in 2011. The 15.26-percent decline translates into more
than $100 million in cost savings for the health care system in Maryland, with
the largest savings coming from avoidance of urinary tract infections, sepsis
and other severe infections, and pneumonia and other lung infections. If
similar results could be achieved nationwide, the Medicare program would save
an estimated $1.3 billion over 2 years, while the health care system as a whole
would save $5.3 billion.[13]
Hospitals have sanitation protocols regarding uniforms, equipment
sterilization, washing, and other preventive measures. Thorough hand_washing
and/or use of alcohol_rubs by all medical personnel before and after each
patient contact is one of the most effective ways to combat nosocomial
infections.[14] More careful use of antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics,
is also considered vital.[15]
Despite sanitation protocol, patients cannot be entirely isolated from
infectious agents. Furthermore, patients are often prescribed antibiotics and
other antimicrobial drugs to help treat illness; this may increase the
selection_pressure for the emergence of resistant strains.[16]
**** Sterilization[edit] ****
Sterilization goes further than just sanitizing. It kills all microorganisms on
equipment and surfaces through exposure to chemicals, ionizing radiation, dry
heat, or steam under pressure.[17]
**** Isolation[edit] ****
Main article: Isolation_(health_care)
Isolation is the implementation of isolating precautions designed to prevent
transmission of microorganisms by common routes in hospitals. (See Universal
precautions and Transmission-based_precautions.) Because agent and host factors
are more difficult to control, interruption of transfer of microorganisms is
directed primarily at transmission for example isolation of infectious cases in
special hospitals and isolation of patient with infected wounds in special
rooms also isolation of joint transplantation patients on specific rooms.
**** Handwashing[edit] ****
Handwashing frequently is called the single most important measure to reduce
the risks of transmitting skin_microorganisms from one person to another or
from one site to another on the same patient. Washing hands as promptly and
thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with blood,
body_fluids, secretions, excretions, and equipment or articles contaminated by
them is an important component of infection control and isolation precautions.
The spread of nosocomial infections, among immunocompromised patients is
connected with health care workers' hand contamination in almost 40% of cases,
and is a challenging problem in the modern hospitals. The best way for workers
to overcome this problem is conducting correct hand-hygiene procedures; this is
why the WHO launched in 2005 the GLOBAL Patient Safety Challenge.[18] Two
categories of micro-organisms can be present on health care workers' hands:
transient flora and resident flora. The first is represented by the micro-
organisms taken by workers from the environment, and the bacteria in it are
capable of surviving on the human skin and sometimes to grow. The second group
is represented by the permanent micro-organisms living on the skin surface (on
the stratum corneum or immediately under it). They are capable of surviving on
the human skin and to grow freely on it. They have low pathogenicity and
infection rate, and they create a kind of protection from the colonization from
other more pathogenic bacteria. The skin of workers is colonized by 3.9 x 104
â 4.6 x 106 cfu/cm2. The microbes comprising the resident flora are:
Staphylococcus_epidermidis, S. hominis, and Microccocus, Propionibacterium,
Corynebacterium, Dermobacterium, and Pitosporum spp., while transient organisms
are S. aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter, Enterobacter and
Candida spp. The goal of hand hygiene is to eliminate the transient flora with
a careful and proper performance of hand washing, using different kinds of
soap, (normal and antiseptic), and alcohol-based gels. The main problems found
in the practice of hand hygiene is connected with the lack of available sinks
and time-consuming performance of hand washing. An easy way to resolve this
problem could be the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, because of faster
application compared to correct hand-washing.[19]
Improving patient hand washing has also been shown to reduce the rate of
nosocomial infection. Patients who are bed-bound often do not have as much
access to clean their hands at mealtimes or after touching surfaces or handling
waste such as tissues. By reinforcing the importance of handwashing and
providing santizing gel or wipes within reach of the bed, nurses were directly
able to reduce infection rates. A study published in 2017 demonstrated this by
improving patient education on both proper hand-washing procedure and important
times to use sanitizer and successfully reduced the rate of enterococci and "S.
aureus".[20]
All visitors must follow the same procedures as hospital staff to adequately
control the spread of infections. Moreover, multidrug-resistant infections can
leave the hospital and become part of the community flora if steps are not
taken to stop this transmission.
It is unclear whether or not nail polish or rings affected surgical wound
infection rates.[21]
**** Gloves[edit] ****
In addition to hand washing, gloves play an important role in reducing the
risks of transmission of microorganisms. Gloves are worn for three important
reasons in hospitals. First, they are worn to provide a protective barrier for
personnel, preventing large scale contamination of the hands when touching
blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and non-intact
skin. In the United States, the Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration
has mandated wearing gloves to reduce the risk of bloodborne_pathogen
infections.[22] Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that
microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to
patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching
a patient's mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, they are worn to reduce
the likelihood that the hands of personnel contaminated with micro-organisms
from a patient or a fomite can transmit those micro-organisms to another
patient. In this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts,
and hands should be washed after gloves are removed.
Wearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing due to the possibility
of contamination when gloves are replaced, or by damage to the glove. Doctors
wearing the same gloves for multiple patient operations presents an infection
control hazard.[23]
**** Surface sanitation[edit] ****
Sanitizing surfaces is part of nosocomial infection in health care
environments. Modern sanitizing methods such as Non-flammable_Alcohol_Vapor_in
Carbon_Dioxide_systems have been effective against gastroenteritis, MRSA, and
influenza agents. Use of hydrogen_peroxide vapor has been clinically proven to
reduce infection rates and risk of acquisition. Hydrogen peroxide is effective
against endospore-forming bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile, where
alcohol has been shown to be ineffective.[24][non-primary_source_needed]
Ultraviolet cleaning devices may also be used to disinfect the rooms of
patients infected with Clostridium difficile or MRSA after discharge.[25][non-
primary_source_needed]
**** Antimicrobial surfaces[edit] ****
Micro-organisms are known to survive on inanimate âtouchâ surfaces for
extended periods of time.[26] This can be especially troublesome in hospital
environments where patients with immunodeficiencies are at enhanced risk for
contracting nosocomial infections.
Touch surfaces commonly found in hospital rooms, such as bed rails, call
buttons, touch plates, chairs, door handles, light switches, grab rails,
intravenous poles, dispensers (alcohol gel, paper towel, soap), dressing
trolleys, and counter and table tops are known to be contaminated with
Staphylococcus, MRSA (one of the most virulent strains of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria) and vancomycin-resistant_Enterococcus (VRE).[27] Objects in closest
proximity to patients have the highest levels of MRSA and VRE. This is why
touch surfaces in hospital rooms can serve as sources, or reservoirs, for the
spread of bacteria from the hands of healthcare workers and visitors to
patients.
A number of compounds can decrease the risk of bacteria growing on surfaces
including: copper, silver, and germicides.[28]
There have been a number of studies evaluating the use of no-touch cleaning
systems particularly the use of ultraviolet C devices. One review was
inconclusive due to lack of, or of poor quality evidence.[29] Other reviews
have found some evidence, and growing evidence of their effectiveness.[30][31]
***** Treatment[edit] *****
Two of the bacteria species most likely to infect patients are the gram-
positive strains of methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus (MRSA), and
gram-negative Acinetobacter_baumannii. While antibiotic drugs to treat diseases
caused by MRSA are available, few effective drugs are available for
Acinetobacter. Acinetobacter bacteria are evolving and becoming immune to
existing antibiotics, so in many cases, polymyxin-type antibacterials need to
be used. "In many respects itâs far worse than MRSA," said a specialist at
Case_Western_Reserve_University.[32]
Another growing disease, especially prevalent in New_York_City hospitals, is
the drug-resistant, gram-negative Klebsiella_pneumoniae. An estimated more than
20% of the Klebsiella infections in Brooklyn hospitals "are now resistant to
virtually all modern antibiotics, and those supergerms are now spreading
worldwide."[32]
The bacteria, classified as gram-negative because of their reaction to the Gram
stain test, can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary_tract,
bloodstream, and other parts of the body. Their cell structures make them more
difficult to attack with antibiotics than gram-positive organisms like MRSA. In
some cases, antibiotic resistance is spreading to gram-negative bacteria that
can infect people outside the hospital. "For gram-positives we need better
drugs; for gram-negatives we need any drugs," said Dr. Brad Spellberg, an
infectious-disease specialist at Harbor-UCLA_Medical_Center, and the author of
Rising Plague, a book about drug-resistant pathogens.[32]
One-third of nosocomial infections are considered preventable. The CDC
estimates 2 million people in the United States are infected annually by
hospital-acquired infections, resulting in 99,000 deaths.[33] The most common
nosocomial infections are of the urinary_tract, surgical site and various
pneumonias.[34]
An alternative treatment targeting localised infections is the use of
irradiation by ultraviolet C.[35]
***** Epidemiology[edit] *****
The methods used differ from country to country (definitions used, type of
nosocomial infections covered, health units surveyed, inclusion or exclusion of
imported infections, etc.), so the international comparisons of nosocomial
infection rates should be made with the utmost care.
**** Belgium[edit] ****
In Belgium the prevalence of nosocomial infections is about 6.2%. Annually
about 125,500 patients become infected by a nosocomial infection, resulting in
almost 3000 deaths. The extra costs for the health insurance are estimated to
be approximately â¬400 million/year.[36]
**** France[edit] ****
Estimates ranged from 6.7% in 1990 to 7.4% (patients may have several
infections).[37] At national level, prevalence among patients in health care
facilities was 6.7% in 1996,[38] 5.9% in 2001[39] and 5.0% in 2006.[40] The
rates for nosocomial infections were 7.6% in 1996, 6.4% in 2001 and 5.4% in
2006.
In 2006, the most common infection sites were urinary_tract_infections (30,3%),
pneumopathy (14,7%), infections of surgery site (14,2%). Infections of the skin
and mucous_membrane (10,2%), other respiratory infections (6,8%) and bacterial
infections / blood poisoning (6,4%).[41] The rates among adult patients in
intensive_care were 13,5% in 2004, 14,6% in 2005, 14,1% in 2006 and 14.4% in
2007.[42]
Nosocomial infections are estimated to make patients stay in the hospital four
to five additional days. Around 2004-2005, about 9,000 people died each year
with a nosocomial infection, of which about 4,200 would have survived without
this infection.[43]
**** Finland[edit] ****
Rate were estimated at 8.5% of patients in 2005.[44]
**** Italy[edit] ****
Since 2000, estimates show about a 6.7% infection rate, i.e. between 450,000
and 700,000 patients, which caused between 4,500 and 7,000 deaths.[45] A survey
in Lombardy gave a rate of 4.9% of patients in 2000.[46]
**** Switzerland[edit] ****
Estimates range between 2 and 14%.[47] A national survey gave a rate of 7.2% in
2004.[48]
**** United Kingdom[edit] ****
In 2012 the Health_Protection_Agency reported the prevalence rate of HAIs in
England was 6.4% in 2011, against a rate of 8.2% in 2006.[49] with respiratory
tract, urinary_tract and surgical_site_infections the most common types of HAI
reported.[49] In 2018 it was reported that in-hospital infections had risen
from 5,972 in 2008 to 48,815 in 2017. [50]
**** United States[edit] ****
The Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention (CDC) estimated roughly 1.7
million hospital-associated infections, from all types of bacteria combined,
cause or contribute to 99,000 deaths each year.[51] Other estimates indicate
10%, or 2 million, patients a year become infected, with the annual cost
ranging from $4.5 billion to $11 billion. In the USA, the most frequent type of
infection hospitalwide is urinary tract infection (36%), followed by surgical
site infection (20%), and bloodstream infection and pneumonia (both 11%).[32]

***** History[edit] *****
Mortality rates 1841â1846 in two clinics documented by Semmelweis
In 1841, Ignaz_Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician was working at a Vienna
maternity hospital. He was "shocked" by the death rate of women who developed
puerperal_fever. He documented that the infection was 20 times higher in the
ward where the medical_students were delivering babies than in the next ward
that was staffed by midwifery students. The medical students were also
routinely working with cadavers. He compared the rates_of_infection with a
similar hospital in Dublin,_Ireland and hypothesized that it was the medical
students who somehow were infecting the women after labor. He instituted
mandatory hand-washing in May 1847 and infection rates dropped dramatically.
Louis_Pasteur proposed the germ theory of disease and began his work on cholera
in 1865 by identifying that it was microorganisms that were associated with
disease.[52][53]
