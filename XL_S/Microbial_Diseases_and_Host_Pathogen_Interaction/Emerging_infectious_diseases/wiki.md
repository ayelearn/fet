An emerging infectious disease (EID) is an infectious_disease whose incidence
has increased in the past 20 years and could increase in the near future.
Emerging infections account for at least 12% of all human pathogens.[1] EIDs
are caused by newly identified species or strains (e.g. Severe_acute
respiratory_syndrome, HIV/AIDS)[2] that may have evolved from a known infection
(e.g. influenza) or spread to a new population (e.g. West_Nile_fever) or to an
area undergoing ecologic transformation (e.g. Lyme_disease), or be reemerging
infections, like drug_resistant tuberculosis. Nosocomial (hospital-acquired)
infections, such as methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus are emerging in
hospitals, and extremely problematic in that they are resistant to many
antibiotics.[3] Of growing concern are adverse synergistic interactions between
emerging diseases and other infectious and non-infectious_conditions leading to
the development of novel syndemics. Many emerging diseases are zoonotic - an
animal reservoir incubates the organism, with only occasional transmission into
human populations.

***** Contributing factors[edit] *****
The U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention (CDC) publishes a journal
Emerging_Infectious_Diseases that identifies the following factors contributing
to disease emergence:
    * Microbial adaption; e.g. genetic_drift and genetic_shift in Influenza_A
    * Changing human susceptibility; e.g. mass immunocompromisation with HIV/
      AIDS
    * Climate and weather; e.g. diseases with zoonotic_vectors such as West
      Nile Disease (transmitted by mosquitoes) are moving further from the
      tropics as the climate warms
    * Change in human demographics and trade; e.g. rapid travel enabled SARS to
      rapidly propagate around the globe
    * Economic development; e.g. use of antibiotics to increase meat yield of
      farmed cows leads to antibiotic_resistance
    * Breakdown of public health; e.g. the current situation in Zimbabwe
    * Poverty and social inequality; e.g. tuberculosis is primarily a problem
      in low-income areas
    * War and famine
    * Bioterrorism; e.g. 2001_Anthrax_attacks
    * Dam and irrigation system construction; e.g. malaria and other mosquito-
      borne diseases

***** Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus[edit] *****
Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus (MRSA) evolved from Methicillin-
susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) otherwise known as common S. aureus.
Many people are natural carriers of S. aureus, without being affected in any
way. MSSA was treatable with the antibiotic methicillin until it acquired the
gene for antibiotic resistance.[6] Though genetic mapping of various strains of
MRSA, scientists have found that MSSA acquired the mecA gene in the 1960s,
which accounts for its pathogenicity, before this it had a predominantly
commensal relationship with humans. It is theorized that when this S. aureus
strain that had acquired the mecA gene was introduced into hospitals, it came
into contact with other hospital bacteria that had already been exposed to high
levels of antibiotics. When exposed to such high levels of antibiotics, the
hospital bacteria suddenly found themselves in an environment that had a high
level of selection for antibiotic resistance, and thus resistance to multiple
antibiotics formed within these hospital populations. When S. aureus came into
contact with these populations, the multiple genes that code for antibiotic
resistance to different drugs were then acquired by MRSA, making it nearly
impossible to control.[7] It is thought that MSSA acquired the resistance gene
through the horizontal gene transfer, a method in which genetic information can
be passed within a generation, and spread rapidly through its own population as
was illustrated in multiple studies.[8] Horizontal gene transfer speeds the
process of genetic transfer since there is no need to wait an entire generation
time for gene to be passed on.[8] Since most antibiotics do not work on MRSA,
physicians have to turn to alternative methods based in Darwinian_medicine.
However prevention is the most preferred method of avoiding antibiotic
resistance. By reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in human and animal
populations, antibiotics resistance can be slowed.
