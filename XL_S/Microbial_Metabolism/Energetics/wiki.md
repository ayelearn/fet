Energetics (also called energy economics) is the study of energy under
transformation. Because energy flows at all scales, from the quantum level to
the biosphere and cosmos, energetics is a very broad discipline, encompassing
for example thermodynamics, chemistry, biological_energetics, biochemistry and
ecological_energetics. Where each branch of energetics begins and ends is a
topic of constant debate. For example, Lehninger (1973, p. 21) contended that
when the science of thermodynamics deals with energy exchanges of all types, it
can be called energetics.

***** Aims[edit] *****
In general, energetics is concerned with defining relationships to describe the
tendencies of energy_flows and storages under transformation, defined here as
phenomena which behave like historical invariants under repeated observations.
When some critical number of people have observed such invariance, such a
principle is usually then given the status of a 'fundamental_law' of science.
As in all scientific inquiry, whether a theorem or principle is considered a
fundamental law appears to depend on how many people agree to the proposition.
The ultimate aim of energetics therefore is the description of fundamental
laws. Philosophers of science have held that the fundamental laws_of
thermodynamics can be treated as laws of energetics, (Reiser 1926, p. 432). By
continuing to more accurately describe these laws, energetics aims to produce
reliable predictions about energy flow and storage transformations at any
scale.
***** History[edit] *****
Energetics has a controversial history. Some authors maintain that the its
origins may be found in the work of the ancient Greeks, but that the
mathematical formalisation began with the work of Leibniz. Richard_de_Villamil
(1928) said that Rankine formulated the science of energetics in his paper
Outlines of the Science of Energetics published in the Proceedings of the
Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1855. W. Ostwald and E. Mach subsequently
developed the study, and by the late 1800s energetics was understood to be
incompatible with the atomic view of the atom forwarded by Boltzmann's gas
theory. Proof of the atom settled the dispute but not without significant
damage. In the 1920s Lotka attempted to build on Boltzmann's views through a
mathematical synthesis of energetics with biological evolutionary theory. Lotka
proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the
maximum useful energy flow transformation. This view subsequently influenced
the further development of ecological energetics, especially the work of Howard
T._Odum.
De Villamil attempted to clarify the scope of energetics with respect to other
branches of physics by positing a system that divides mechanics into two
branches; energetics (the science of energy), and "pure", "abstract" or "rigid"
dynamics (the science of momentum). According to Villamil energetics can be
mathematically characterised by scalar equations, and rigid dynamics by vector
equations. In this division the dimensions for dynamics are space, time and
mass, and for energetics, length, time and mass (Villamil 1928, p. 9). This
division is made according to fundamental suppositions about the properties of
bodies, e.g.:
   1. Are the particles comprising the system rigidly fixed together?
   2. Is there any machinery for stopping moving bodies?
In Villamil's classification system, dynamics says yes to 1 and no to 2,
whereas energetics says no to 1 and yes to 2. Therefore, in Villamil's system,
dynamics assumes that particles are rigidly fixed together and cannot vibrate,
and consequently must all be at zero kelvin. The conservation_of_momentum is a
consequence of this view, however it is considered valid only in logic and not
to be a true representation of the facts (Villamil, p. 96). In contrast
energetics does not assume that particles are rigidly fixed together, and thus
are free to vibrate, and consequently can be at non-zero temperatures.
***** Theories[edit] *****
Ecological analysis of CO2 in an ecosystem
As a general statement of energy flows under transformation, the principles of
energetics include the first four laws_of_thermodynamics which seek a rigorous
description. However the precise place of the laws of thermodynamics within the
principles of energetics is a topic currently under debate. If the ecologist
Howard_T._Odum was right, the principles of energetics take into consideration
a hierarchical ordering of energy forms, which aims to account for the concept
of energy_quality, and the evolution of the universe. Albert_Lehninger (1973,
p. 2) called these hierarchical orderings the
     ... successive stages in the flow of energy through the biological
     macrocosm
Odum proposed 3 further energetic principles and one corollary that take energy
hierarchy into account. The first four principles of energetics are related to
the same numbered laws of thermodynamics, and are expanded upon in that
article.
