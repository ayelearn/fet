The Golgi apparatus, also known as the Golgi complex, Golgi body, or simply the
Golgi, is an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells.[1] It was identified in
1897 by the Italian scientist Camillo_Golgi and named after him in 1898.[2]
Part of the endomembrane_system in the cytoplasm, the Golgi apparatus packages
proteins into membrane-bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are
sent to their destination. The Golgi apparatus resides at the intersection of
the secretory, lysosomal, and endocytic pathways. It is of particular
importance in processing proteins for secretion, containing a set of
glycosylation enzymes that attach various sugar monomers to proteins as the
proteins move through the apparatus.

***** Discovery *****
Owing to its large size and distinctive structure, the Golgi apparatus was one
of the first organelles to be discovered and observed in detail. It was
discovered in 1898 by Italian physician Camillo_Golgi during an investigation
of the nervous_system.[3][2] After first observing it under his microscope, he
termed the structure as apparato reticolare interno ("internal reticular
apparatus"). Some doubted the discovery at first, arguing that the appearance
of the structure was merely an optical illusion created by the observation
technique used by Golgi. With the development of modern microscopes in the 20th
century, the discovery was confirmed.[4] Early references to the Golgi
apparatus referred to it by various names including the "GolgiâHolmgren
apparatus", "GolgiâHolmgren ducts", and "GolgiâKopsch apparatus".[2] The
term "Golgi apparatus" was used in 1910 and first appeared in the scientific
literature in 1913, while "Golgi complex" was introduced in 1956.[2]
***** Subcellular localization *****
The subcellular localization of the Golgi apparatus varies among eukaryotes. In
mammals, a single Golgi apparatus is usually located near the cell_nucleus,
close to the centrosome. Tubular connections are responsible for linking the
stacks together. Localization and tubular connections of the Golgi apparatus
are dependent on microtubules. In experiments it is seen that as microtubules
are depolymerized the Golgi apparatuses lose mutual connections and become
individual stacks throughout the cytoplasm.[5] In yeast, multiple Golgi
apparatuses are scattered throughout the cytoplasm (as observed in
Saccharomyces_cerevisiae). In plants, Golgi stacks are not concentrated at the
centrosomal region and do not form Golgi ribbons.[6] Organization of the plant
Golgi depends on actin cables and not microtubules.[6] The common feature among
Golgi is that they are adjacent to endoplasmic_reticulum (ER) exit sites.[7]
***** Structure *****
3D rendering of Golgi apparatus
Diagram of a single "stack" of Golgi
In most eukaryotes, the Golgi apparatus is made up of a series of compartments
and is a collection of fused, flattened membrane-enclosed disks known as
cisternae (singular: cisterna, also called "dictyosomes"), originating from
vesicular clusters that bud off the endoplasmic_reticulum. A mammalian cell
typically contains 40 to 100 stacks of cisternae.[8] Between four and eight
cisternae are usually present in a stack; however, in some protists as many as
sixty cisternae have been observed.[4] This collection of cisternae is broken
down into cis, medial, and trans compartments, making up two main networks: the
cis Golgi network (CGN) and the trans Golgi network (TGN). The CGN is the first
cisternal structure, and the TGN is the final, from which proteins are packaged
into vesicles destined to lysosomes, secretory vesicles, or the cell surface.
The TGN is usually positioned adjacent to the stack, but can also be separate
from it. The TGN may act as an early endosome in yeast and plants.[6]
There are structural and organizational differences in the Golgi apparatus
among eukaryotes. In some yeasts, Golgi stacking is not observed. Pichia
pastoris does have stacked Golgi, while Saccharomyces_cerevisiae does not.[6]
In plants, the individual stacks of the Golgi apparatus seem to operate
independently.[6]
The Golgi apparatus tends to be larger and more numerous in cells that
synthesize and secrete large amounts of substances; for example, the antibody-
secreting plasma_B_cells of the immune system have prominent Golgi complexes.
In all eukaryotes, each cisternal stack has a cis entry face and a trans exit
face. These faces are characterized by unique morphology and biochemistry.[9]
Within individual stacks are assortments of enzymes responsible for selectively
modifying protein cargo. These modifications influence the fate of the protein.
The compartmentalization of the Golgi apparatus is advantageous for separating
enzymes, thereby maintaining consecutive and selective processing steps:
enzymes catalyzing early modifications are gathered in the cis face cisternae,
and enzymes catalyzing later modifications are found in trans face cisternae of
the Golgi stacks.[5][9]
***** Function *****
The Golgi apparatus (salmon pink) in context of the secretory pathway.
The Golgi apparatus is a major collection and dispatch station of protein
products received from the endoplasmic_reticulum (ER). Proteins synthesized in
the ER are packaged into vesicles, which then fuse with the Golgi apparatus.
These cargo proteins are modified and destined for secretion via exocytosis or
for use in the cell. In this respect, the Golgi can be thought of as similar to
a post office: it packages and labels items which it then sends to different
parts of the cell or to the extracellular_space. The Golgi apparatus is also
involved in lipid transport and lysosome formation.[10]
The structure and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked.
Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for
progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to
the trans Golgi face.[5][9] Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur
exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This
feature is in contrast to the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its
lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational_modification of
proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal
proteins occurs in the early CGN.[5] Cis cisterna are associated with the
removal of mannose residues.[5][9] Removal of mannose residues and addition of
N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae.[5] Addition of galactose and
sialic_acid occurs in the trans cisternae.[5] Sulfation of tyrosines and
carbohydrates occurs within the TGN.[5] Other general post-translational
modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation)
[11] and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal
sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the
Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for
lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the
formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to
glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans.[12] Glycosaminoglycans are
long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular_matrix of
animals.
***** Vesicular transport *****

Golgi Apparatus
The vesicles that leave the rough_endoplasmic_reticulum are transported to the
cis face of the Golgi apparatus, where they fuse with the Golgi membrane and
empty their contents into the lumen. Once inside the lumen, the molecules are
modified, then sorted for transport to their next destinations.
Those proteins destined for areas of the cell other than either the endoplasmic
reticulum or the Golgi apparatus are moved through the Golgi cisternae towards
the trans face, to a complex network of membranes and associated vesicles known
as the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This area of the Golgi is the point at which
proteins are sorted and shipped to their intended destinations by their
placement into one of at least three different types of vesicles, depending
upon the signal_sequence they carry.

                     received they move toward

                     fuses with the late
                     endosome, and the contents
                     are then transferred to the
                     lysosome via unknown
                     mechanisms.
***** Current models of vesicular transport and trafficking *****
**** Model 1: Anterograde vesicular transport between stable compartments ****
    * In this model, the Golgi is viewed as a set of stable compartments that
      work together. Each compartment has a unique collection of enzymes that
      work to modify protein cargo. Proteins are delivered from the ER to the
      cis face using COPII-coated vesicles. Cargo then progress toward the
      trans face in COPI-coated vesicles. This model proposes that COPI
      vesicles move in two directions: anterograde vesicles carry secretory
      proteins, while retrograde vesicles recycle Golgi-specific trafficking
      proteins.[13]
          o Strengths: The model explains observations of compartments,
            polarized distribution of enzymes, and waves of moving vesicles. It
            also attempts to explain how Golgi-specific enzymes are recycled.
            [13]
          o Weaknesses: Since the amount of COPI vesicles varies drastically
            among types of cells, this model cannot easily explain high
            trafficking activity within the Golgi for both small and large
            cargoes. Additionally, there is no convincing evidence that COPI
            vesicles move in both the anterograde and retrograde directions.
            [13]
    * This model was widely accepted from the early 1980s until the late 1990s.
      [13]
**** Model 2: Cisternal progression/maturation ****
    * In this model, the fusion of COPII vesicles from the ER begins the
      formation of the first cis-cisterna of the Golgi stack, which progresses
      later to become mature TGN cisternae. Once matured, the TGN cisternae
      dissolve to become secretory vesicles. While this progression occurs,
      COPI vesicles continually recycle Golgi-specific proteins by delivery
      from older to younger cisternae. Different recycling patterns may account
      for the differing biochemistry throughout the Golgi stack. Thus, the
      compartments within the Golgi are seen as discrete kinetic stages of the
      maturing Golgi apparatus.[13]
          o Strengths: The model addresses the existence of Golgi compartments,
            as well as differing biochemistry within the cisternae, transport
            of large proteins, transient formation and disintegration of the
            cisternae, and retrograde mobility of native Golgi proteins, and it
            can account for the variability seen in the structures of the
            Golgi.[13]
          o Weaknesses: This model cannot easily explain the observation of
            fused Golgi networks, tubular connections among cisternae, and
            differing kinetics of secretory cargo exit.[13]
**** Model 3: Cisternal progression/maturation with heterotypic tubular
transport ****
    * This model is an extension of the cisternal progression/maturation model.
      It incorporates the existence of tubular connections among the cisternae
      that form the Golgi ribbon, in which cisternae within a stack are linked.
      This model posits that the tubules are important for bidirectional
      traffic in the ER-Golgi system: they allow for fast anterograde traffic
      of small cargo and/or the retrograde traffic of native Golgi proteins.
      [13]
          o Strengths: This model encompasses the strengths of the cisternal
            progression/maturation model that also explains rapid trafficking
            of cargo, and how native Golgi proteins can recycle independently
            of COPI vesicles.[13]
          o Weaknesses: This model cannot explain the transport kinetics of
            large protein cargo, such as collagen. Additionally, tubular
            connections are not prevalent in plant cells. The roles that these
            connections have can be attributed to a cell-specific
            specialization rather than a universal trait. If the membranes are
            continuous, that suggests the existence of mechanisms that preserve
            the unique biochemical gradients observed throughout the Golgi
            apparatus.[13]
**** Model 4: Rapid partitioning in a mixed Golgi ****
    * This rapid partitioning model is the most drastic alteration of the
      traditional vesicular trafficking point of view. Proponents of this model
      hypothesize that the Golgi works as a single unit, containing domains
      that function separately in the processing and export of protein cargo.
      Cargo from the ER move between these two domains, and randomly exit from
      any level of the Golgi to their final location. This model is supported
      by the observation that cargo exits the Golgi in a pattern best described
      by exponential kinetics. The existence of domains is supported by
      fluorescence microscopy data.[13]
          o Strengths: Notably, this model explains the exponential kinetics of
            cargo exit of both large and small proteins, whereas other models
            cannot.[13]
          o Weaknesses: This model cannot explain the transport kinetics of
            large protein cargo, such as collagen. This model falls short on
            explaining the observation of discrete compartments and polarized
            biochemistry of the Golgi cisternae. It also does not explain
            formation and disintegration of the Golgi network, nor the role of
            COPI vesicles.[13]
**** Model 5: Stable compartments as cisternal model progenitors ****
    * This is the most recent model. In this model, the Golgi is seen as a
      collection of stable compartments defined by Rab_(G-protein) GTPases.[13]
          o Strengths: This model is consistent with numerous observations and
            encompasses some of the strengths of the cisternal progression/
            maturation model. Additionally, what is known of the Rab GTPase
            roles in mammalian endosomes can help predict putative roles within
            the Golgi. This model is unique in that it can explain the
            observation of "megavesicle" transport intermediates.[13]
          o Weaknesses: This model does not explain morphological variations in
            the Golgi apparatus, nor define a role for COPI vesicles. This
            model does not apply well for plants, algae, and fungi in which
            individual Golgi stacks are observed (transfer of domains between
            stacks is not likely). Additionally, megavesicles are not
            established to be intra-Golgi transporters.[13]
Though there are multiple models that attempt to explain vesicular traffic
throughout the Golgi, no individual model can independently explain all
observations of the Golgi apparatus. Currently, the cisternal progression/
maturation model is the most accepted among scientists, accommodating many
observations across eukaryotes. The other models are still important in framing
questions and guiding future experimentation. Among the fundamental unanswered
questions are the directionality of COPI vesicles and role of Rab GTPases in
modulating protein cargo traffic.[13]
***** Brefeldin A *****
Brefeldin_A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite used experimentally to disrupt the
secretion pathway as a method of testing Golgi function.[14] BFA blocks the
activation of some ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs).[15] ARFs are small GTPases
which regulate vesicular trafficking through the binding of COPs to endosomes
and the Golgi.[15] BFA inhibits the function of several guanine_nucleotide
exchange_factors (GEFs) that mediate GTP-binding of ARFs.[15] Treatment of
cells with BFA thus disrupts the secretion pathway, promoting disassembly of
the Golgi apparatus and distributing Golgi proteins to the endosomes and ER.
