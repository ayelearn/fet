Chemical reaction engineering (reaction engineering or reactor engineering) is
a specialty in chemical_engineering or industrial chemistry dealing with
chemical_reactors. Frequently the term relates specifically to catalytic
reaction systems where either a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst is
present in the reactor. Sometimes a reactor per se is not present by itself,
but rather is integrated into a process, for example in reactive separations
vessels, retorts, certain fuel_cells, and photocatalytic surfaces. The issue of
solvent_effects on reaction kinetics is also considered as an integral part.[1]

***** Origin of chemical reaction engineering[edit] *****
Chemical reaction engineering as a discipline started in the early 1950s under
the impulse of researchers at the Shell Amsterdam research center and the
university of Delft. The term chemical reaction engineering was apparently
coined by J.C. Vlugter while preparing the 1st European Symposium on Chemical
Reaction Engineering which was held in Amsterdam in 1957.
***** Discipline[edit] *****
Chemical reaction engineering aims at studying and optimizing chemical
reactions in order to define the best reactor design. Hence, the interactions
of flow phenomena, mass_transfer, heat_transfer, and reaction_kinetics are of
prime importance in order to relate reactor performance to feed composition and
operating conditions. Although originally applied to the petroleum and
petrochemical industries, its general methodology combining reaction chemistry
and chemical_engineering concepts allows optimization of a variety of systems
where modeling or engineering of reactions is needed. Chemical reaction
engineering approaches are indeed tailored for the development of new processes
and the improvement of existing technologies.

***** ISCRE Symposia[edit] *****
The most important series of symposia are the International Symposia on
Chemical Reaction Engineering or ISCRE_conferences.[2] These three-day
conferences are held every two years, rotating among sites in North America,
Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, on a six-year cycle. These conferences
bring together for three days distinguished international researchers in
reaction engineering, prominent industrial practitioners, and new researchers
and students of this multifaceted field. ISCRE symposia are a unique gathering
place for reaction engineers where research gains are consolidated and new
frontiers explored. The state of the art of various sub-disciplines of reaction
engineering is reviewed in a timely manner, and new research initiatives are
discussed.[3]
***** Awards in Chemical Reaction Engineering[edit] *****
The ISCRE Board administers two premiere awards in chemical reaction
engineering for senior and junior researchers every three years.
**** Neal R. Amundson Award for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering
[edit] ****
In 1996, the ISCRE Board of Directors established the Neal R. Amundson Award
for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering. This award recognizes a
pioneer in the field of Chemical Reaction Engineering who has exerted a major
influence on the theory or practice of the field, through originality,
creativity, and novelty of concept or application. The award is made every
three years at an ISCRE meeting, and consists of a Plaque and a check in the
amount of $5000. The Amundson Award is generously supported by a grant from the
ExxonMobil Corporation. Winners of the award include:
    * 1996: Neal_Amundson, Professor - University of Minnesota, University of
      Houston
    * 1998: Rutherford_Aris, Professor - University of Minnesota
    * 2001: Octave_Levenspiel, Professor - Oregon State University
    * 2004: Vern Weekman, Mobil
    * 2007: Gilbert_Froment, Professor - University of Gent, Texas A&M
      University
    * 2010: Dan_Luss, Professor - University of Houston
    * 2013: Lanny_Schmidt, Professor - University of Minnesota
    * 2016: Milorad P. Dudukovic, Professor - Washington University
    * 2019: W._Harmon_Ray, Professor - University of Wisconsin
    * 2022: Announced at NASCRE-5
**** Rutherford Aris Young Investigator Award in Chemical Reaction Engineering
[edit] ****
In 2016, the ISCRE, Inc. Board of Directors will bestow the first Rutherford
Aris Young Investigator Award for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering.
[4] This award will recognize outstanding contributions in experimental and/or
theoretical reaction engineering research of investigators in early stages of
their career. The recipient must be less than 40 years of age at the end of the
calendar year in which the award is presented. The Aris Award is generously
supported by a grant from the UOP, L.L.C., a Honeywell Company. The award
consists of a plaque, an honorarium of $3000, and up to $2000 in travel funds
to present at an ISCRE/NASCRE conference and to present a lecture at UOP. This
award complements ISCRE's other major honor, the Neal R. Amundson Award.
Winners of the award include:
    * 2016: Paul J. Dauenhauer, Professor - University of Minnesota, USA
    * 2019: Yuriy Roman-Leschkov, Professor, MIT, USA.
    * 2022: Announced at NASCRE-5
