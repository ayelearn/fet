Film, also called movie or motion picture, is a medium used to simulate
experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or
atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with
other sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is
often used to refer to filmmaking and the film_industry, and to the art form
that is the result of it.
The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a
motion-picture_camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using
traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer_animation, or by
a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual_effects.
Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film through a photochemical
process and then shown through a movie_projector onto a large screen.
Contemporary films are often fully_digital through the entire process of
production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a
photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical_soundtrack (a
graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany
the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it,
and is not projected).
Films are cultural_artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those
cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art
form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for
educatingâor indoctrinatingâcitizens. The visual basis of film gives it a
universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide
attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog
into other languages.
The individual images that make up a film are called frames. In the projection
of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness
as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer
does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence_of
vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after
its source disappears. The perception of motion is partly due to a
psychological effect called the phi_phenomenon.
The name "film" originates from the fact that photographic_film (also called
film_stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying
motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture,
including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay, and flick. The most
common term in the United_States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred.
Common terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver
screen, the movies, and cinema; the last of these is commonly used, as an
overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the
word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen.

The Berlin_Wintergarten_theatre was the site of the first cinema ever, with a
short_film presented by the Skladanowsky_brothers on 1 November 1895. (Pictured
here is a variety_show at the theater in July 1940.)
**** Preceding technologies ****
Preceding film in origin by thousands of years, early plays and dances had
elements common to film: scripts, sets, costumes, production, direction,
actors, audiences, storyboards and scores. Much terminology later used in film
theory and criticism apply, such as mise_en_scÃ¨ne (roughly, the entire visual
picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for doing so, the
moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.
The magic_lantern, probably created by Christiaan_Huygens in the 1650s, could
be used to project animation, which was achieved by various types of mechanical
slides. Typically, two glass slides, one with the stationary part of the
picture and the other with the part that was to move, would be placed one on
top of the other and projected together, then the moving slide would be hand-
operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism.
Chromotrope slides, which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously
cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors, were operated by means of a
small crank and pulley wheel that rotated a glass disc.[2]
In the mid-19th century, inventions such as Joseph_Plateau's phenakistoscope
and the later zoetrope demonstrated that a carefully designed sequence of
drawings, showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion, would
appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the
other at a sufficiently rapid rate. These devices relied on the phenomenon of
persistence_of_vision to make the display appear continuous even though the
observer's view was actually blocked at the moment a drawing rotated into the
location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed. Each sequence was
limited to a small number of drawings, usually twelve, so it could only show
endlessly repeating cyclical motions. By the late 1880s, the last major device
of this type, the praxinoscope, had been elaborated into a form that employed a
long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the
elements of a magic_lantern to project them onto a screen.
The use of sequences of photographs in such devices was initially limited to a
few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses because the
available emulsions were not sensitive enough to allow the short exposures
needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was
gradually improved and in the late 1870s, Eadweard_Muybridge created the first
image sequences photographed in real-time. A row of cameras was used, each, in
turn, capturing one image on a photographic_glass_plate, so the total number of
images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras, about two dozen
at most. Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety
of animal and human subjects. Hand-painted images based on the photographs were
projected as moving images by means of his zoopraxiscope.[3]

**** First motion pictures ****
By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic
film and the invention of motion_picture_cameras, which could photograph an
indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several
minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film.
Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a "peep
show" device such as the Kinetoscope and the mutoscope. Others were intended
for a projector, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the
same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed
and printed film and into a projection lens so that these "moving pictures"
could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire
audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was Blacksmith
Scene, produced by Edison_Manufacturing_Company in 1893. The following year the
company would begin Edison_Studios, which became an early leader in the film
industry with notable early shorts including The_Kiss, and would go on to
produce close to 1,200 films.
The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made
in 1895 by the American Woodville_Latham and his sons, using films produced by
their Eidoloscope company,[4] and by the â arguably better known â French
brothers Auguste_and_Louis_LumiÃ¨re with ten of their own productions.[citation
needed] Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's
slightly predating the LumiÃ¨re brothers'.[citation_needed] Another opinion is
that the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at
Brooklyn_Institute in New_York_City 9 May 1893.
**** Early evolution ****
The earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action
with no editing or other cinematic_techniques. Around the turn of the 20th
century, films started stringing several scenes together to tell a story. The
scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different
distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed
as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until sound_film became
commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely visual
art, but these innovative silent_films had gained a hold on the public
imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector
as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a pianist or organist or, in large
urban theaters, a full orchestra to play music that fit the mood of the film at
any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of
sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete film_scores were composed
for major productions.
[File:Charlie Chaplin, the Marriage Bond.ogv]Play_media
A clip from the Charlie_Chaplin silent film The_Bond (1918)
The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of World_War_I,
while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of
Hollywood, typified most prominently by the innovative work of D._W._Griffith
in The_Birth_of_a_Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916). However, in the 1920s,
European filmmakers such as Sergei_Eisenstein, F._W._Murnau and Fritz_Lang, in
many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith,
along with the contributions of Charles_Chaplin, Buster_Keaton and others,
quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance
the medium.
**** Sound ****
In the 1920s, the development of electronic sound_recording technologies made
it practical to incorporate a soundtrack of speech, music and sound_effects
synchronized with the action on the screen.[citation_needed] The resulting
sound_films were initially distinguished from the usual silent "moving
pictures" or "movies" by calling them "talking pictures" or "talkies."[citation
needed] The revolution they wrought was swift. By 1930, silent film was
practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as "the old
medium."[citation_needed]
**** Color ****
Another major technological development was the introduction of "natural
color," which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather
than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or
other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded
colors which were far from "natural" in appearance.[citation_needed] While the
advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete,
color replaced black-and-white much more gradually.[citation_needed] The
pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the
Technicolor process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for
live-action short_films and isolated sequences in a few feature_films, then for
an entire feature film, Becky_Sharp, in 1935. The expense of the process was
daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased box_office
receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color
slowly increased year after year.
**** 1950s: growing influence of television ****
In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started
seriously depressing North American theater attendance.[citation_needed] In an
attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed,
widescreen processes, polarized_3D_projection, and stereophonic_sound were
introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule
rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still
being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end
of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the
mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in
color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became
common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was
clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in
mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with the
usual exceptions made only at the insistence of "star" filmmakers such as Peter
Bogdanovich and Martin_Scorsese.[citation_needed]
**** 1960s and later ****
The decades following the decline of the studio_system in the 1960s saw changes
in the production and style of film. Various New Wave movements (including the
French_New_Wave, Indian_New_Wave, Japanese_New_Wave, and New_Hollywood) and the
rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes
the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century.[citation_needed]
Digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s
and into the 2000s. Digital 3D projection largely replaced earlier problem-
prone 3D film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s.[citation
needed]
***** Film theory *****
[16_mm_spring-wound_Bolex_H16_Reflex_camera]
This 16_mm spring-wound Bolex "H16" Reflex camera is a popular entry level
camera used in film_schools.
"Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to
the study of film as art. The concept of film as an art-form began in 1911 with
Ricciotto_Canudo's The Birth of the Sixth Art. Formalist_film_theory, led by
Rudolf_Arnheim, BÃ©la_BalÃ¡zs, and Siegfried_Kracauer, emphasized how film
differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid fine_art. AndrÃ©
Bazin reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay
in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its differences from
reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by
Jacques_Lacan's psychoanalysis and Ferdinand_de_Saussure's semiotics among
other things has given rise to psychoanalytic_film_theory, structuralist_film
theory, feminist_film_theory, and others. On the other hand, critics from the
analytical_philosophy tradition, influenced by Wittgenstein, try to clarify
misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's
vocabulary and its link to a form_of_life.
**** Language ****
Film is considered to have its own language. James_Monaco wrote a classic text
on film theory, titled "How to Read a Film," that addresses this. Director
Ingmar_Bergman famously said, "Andrei_Tarkovsky for me is the greatest
director, the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as
it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream." An example of the language
is a sequence of back and forth images of one speaking actor's left profile,
followed by another speaking actor's right profile, then a repetition of this,
which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. This
describes another theory of film, the 180-degree_rule, as a visual story-
telling device with an ability to place a viewer in a context of being
psychologically present through the use of visual composition and editing. The
"Hollywood_style" includes this narrative theory, due to the overwhelming
practice of the rule by movie studios based in Hollywood, California, during
film's classical era. Another example of cinematic language is having a shot
that zooms in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent
reflection that cuts to a shot of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the
first actor, indicating that the first person is remembering a past self, an
edit of compositions that causes a time transition.
**** Montage ****
Main article: Montage
Montage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited,
and then pieced together to make a new section of film. A scene could show a
man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and
with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. As
these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final
version is called a montage. Directors developed a theory of montage, beginning
with Eisenstein and the complex juxtaposition of images in his film Battleship
Potemkin.[5] Incorporation of musical and visual counterpoint, and scene
development through mise_en_scene, editing, and effects has led to more complex
techniques comparable to those used in opera and ballet.
**** Film criticism ****
Main article: Film_criticism
Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works
can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and
journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in newspapers and other
media. Film critics working for newspapers, magazines, and broadcast_media
mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have
only a day or two to formulate their opinions. Despite this, critics have an
important impact on the audience response and attendance at films, especially
those of certain genres. Mass marketed action, horror, and comedy_films tend
not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot
summary and description of a film and the assessment of the director's and
screenwriters' work that makes up the majority of most film reviews can still
have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige
films such as most dramas and art_films, the influence of reviews is important.
Poor reviews from leading critics at major papers and magazines will often
reduce audience interest and attendance.
The impact of a reviewer on a given film's box_office performance is a matter
of debate. Some observers claim that movie_marketing in the 2000s is so
intense, well-coordinated and well financed that reviewers cannot prevent a
poorly written or filmed blockbuster from attaining market success. However,
the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted films which were harshly
reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent
films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable
influence. Other observers note that positive film reviews have been shown to
spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films
in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give
reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However,
this usually backfires, as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public
that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a
result. Journalist film critics are sometimes called film reviewers. Critics
who take a more academic approach to films, through publishing in film journals
and writing books about films using film_theory or film_studies approaches,
study how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on
people. Rather than having their reviews published in newspapers or appearing
on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals or up-market
magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities as
professors or instructors.

[Babelsberg_Studio_near_Berlin_gate_with_pedestrian_island]
Founded in 1912, the Babelsberg_Studio near Berlin was the first large-scale
film studio in the world, and the forerunner to Hollywood. It still produces
global blockbusters every year.
The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as
soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new
invention, and its product, was in their native France, the LumiÃ¨res quickly
set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty
and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local
scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the
various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export,
import, and screen additional product commercially. The Oberammergau_Passion
Play of 1898[citation_needed] was the first commercial motion picture ever
produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate
industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated theaters and
companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion
picture actors became major celebrities and commanded huge fees for their
performances. By 1917 Charlie_Chaplin had a contract that called for an annual
salary of one million dollars. From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image
storage and playback system for television_programming until the introduction
of videotape_recorders.
In the United States, much of the film industry is centered around Hollywood,
California. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, such as
Mumbai-centered Bollywood, the Indian_film_industry's Hindi cinema which
produces the largest number of films in the world.[6] Though the expense
involved in making films has led cinema production to concentrate under the
auspices of movie_studios, recent advances in affordable film making equipment
have allowed independent film productions to flourish.
Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of
filmmaking; many films have large cost_overruns, an example being Kevin
Costner's Waterworld. Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting
social significance. The Academy_Awards (also known as "the Oscars") are the
most prominent film awards in the United_States, providing recognition each
year to films, based on their artistic merits. There is also a large industry
for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to
lectures and texts. Revenue in the industry is sometimes volatile due to the
reliance on blockbuster_films released in movie_theaters. The rise of
alternative home entertainment has raised questions about the future of the
cinema industry, and Hollywood employment has become less reliable,
particularly for medium and low-budget films.[7]
***** Associated fields *****
Further information: Film_theory, Product_placement, and Propaganda
Derivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop
independently of filmmaking, as in film_theory and analysis. Fields of academic
study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of
film, such as film_criticism, film_history, divisions of film_propaganda in
authoritarian governments, or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g., of a
flashing soda can during a screening). These fields may further create
derivative fields, such as a movie_review section in a newspaper or a
television guide. Sub-industries can spin off from film, such as popcorn
makers, and film-related toys (e.g., Star_Wars_figures). Sub-industries of pre-
existing industries may deal specifically with film, such as product_placement
and other advertising within films.
***** Terminology *****
The terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between
British_and_American_English. In British usage, the name of the medium is
"film". The word "movie" is understood but seldom used.[8][9] Additionally,
"the pictures" (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where
movies are exhibited, while in American English this may be called "the
movies", but it is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where
movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or movie_theatre. By contrast, in
the United States, "movie" is the predominant form. Although the words "film"
and "movie" are sometimes used interchangeably, "film" is more often used when
considering artistic, theoretical, or technical aspects. The term "movies" more
often refers to entertainment or commercial aspects, as where to go for fun
evening on a date. For example, a book titled "How to Understand a Film" would
probably be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while a book entitled
"Let's Go to the Movies" would probably be about the history of entertaining
movies and blockbusters.
Further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media used in the
film industry. "Motion pictures" and "moving pictures" are frequently used
terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical
exhibition, such as, for instance, Batman. "DVD" and "videotape" are video
formats that can reproduce a photochemical film. A reproduction based on such
is called a "transfer." After the advent of theatrical film as an industry, the
television industry began using videotape as a recording medium. For many
decades, tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be
either recorded or transferred. "Film" and "filming" refer to the photochemical
medium that chemically records a visual image and the act of recording
respectively. However, the act of shooting images with other visual media, such
as with a digital camera, is still called "filming" and the resulting works
often called "films" as interchangeable to "movies," despite not being shot on
film. "Silent_films" need not be utterly silent, but are films and movies
without an audible dialogue, including those that have a musical accompaniment.
The word, "Talkies," refers to the earliest sound films created to have audible
dialogue recorded for playback along with the film, regardless of a musical
accompaniment. "Cinema" either broadly encompasses both films and movies, or it
is roughly synonymous with film and theatrical exhibition, and both are
capitalized when referring to a category of art. The "silver_screen" refers to
the projection screen used to exhibit films and, by extension, is also used as
a metonym for the entire film industry.
"Widescreen" refers to a larger width to height in the frame, compared to
earlier historic aspect_ratios.[10] A "feature-length film", or "feature_film",
is of a conventional full length, usually 60 minutes or more, and can
commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening.[11] A
"short" is a film that is not as long as a feature-length film, often screened
with other shorts, or preceding a feature-length film. An "independent" is a
film made outside the conventional film industry.
In US usage, one talks of a "screening" or "projection" of a movie or video on
a screen at a public or private "theater." In British English, a "film showing"
happens at a cinema (never a "theatre", which is a different medium and place
altogether).[9] A cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to
exhibit films, where the screen is affixed to a wall, while a theater usually
refers to a place where live, non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs
from a podium or other type of stage, including the amphitheater. Theaters can
still screen movies in them, though the theater would be retrofitted to do so.
One might propose "going to the cinema" when referring to the activity, or
sometimes "to the pictures" in British English, whereas the US expression is
usually "going to the movies." A cinema usually shows a mass-marketed movie
using a front-projection screen process with either a film projector or, more
recently, with a digital projector. But, cinemas may also show theatrical
movies from their home video transfers that include Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and
videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon
need, such as movies that exist only in their transferred state, which may be
due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the
movie originally existed. Due to the advent of digital_film_production_and
distribution, physical film might be absent entirely. A "double_feature" is a
screening of two independently marketed, stand-alone feature films. A "viewing"
is a watching of a film. "Sales" and "at the box office" refer to tickets sold
at a theater, or more currently, rights sold for individual showings. A
"release" is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film. A
"preview" is a screening in advance of the main release.
Any film may also have a "sequel", which portrays events following those in the
film. Bride_of_Frankenstein is an early example. When there are more films than
one with the same characters, story arcs, or subject themes, these movies
become a "series," such as the James_Bond series. And, existing outside a
specific story timeline usually, does not exclude a film from being part of a
series. A film that portrays events occurring earlier in a timeline with those
in another film, but is released after that film, is sometimes called a
"prequel," an example being Butch_and_Sundance:_The_Early_Days.
The "credits," or "end credits," is a list that gives credit to the people
involved in the production of a film. Films from before the 1970s usually start
a film with credits, often ending with only a title card, saying "The End" or
some equivalent, often an equivalent that depends on the language of the
production[citation_needed]. From then onward, a film's credits usually appear
at the end of most films. However, films with credits that end a film often
repeat some credits at or near the start of a film and therefore appear twice,
such as that film's acting leads, while less frequently some appearing near or
at the beginning only appear there, not at the end, which often happens to the
director's credit. The credits appearing at or near the beginning of a film are
usually called "titles" or "beginning titles." A post-credits_scene is a scene
shown after the end of the credits. Ferris_Bueller's_Day_Off has a post-credit
scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the film is over and they should
go home.
A film's "cast" refers to a collection of the actors and actresses who appear,
or "star," in a film. A star is an actor or actress, often a popular one, and
in many cases, a celebrity who plays a central character in a film.
Occasionally the word can also be used to refer to the fame of other members of
the crew, such as a director or other personality, such as Martin_Scorsese. A
"crew" is usually interpreted as the people involved in a film's physical
construction outside cast participation, and it could include directors, film
editors, photographers, grips, gaffers, set decorators, prop masters, and
costume designers. A person can both be part of a film's cast and crew, such as
Woody_Allen, who directed and starred in Take_the_Money_and_Run.
A "film goer," "movie goer," or "film buff" is a person who likes or often
attends films and movies, and any of these, though more often the latter, could
also see oneself as a student to films and movies or the filmic process.
Intense interest in films, film theory, and film criticism, is known as
cinephilia. A film enthusiast is known as a cinephile or cineaste.
**** Preview ****
Main article: Test_screening
A preview performance refers to a showing of a film to a select audience,
usually for the purposes of corporate promotions, before the public film
premiere itself. Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction, which
if unexpectedly negative, may result in recutting or even refilming certain
sections based on the audience_response. One example of a film that was changed
after a negative response from the test screening is 1982's First_Blood. After
the test audience responded very negatively to the death of protagonist John
Rambo, a Vietnam_veteran, at the end of the film, the company wrote and re-shot
a new ending in which the character survives.[12]
**** Trailer and teaser ****
Main article: Film_trailer
Trailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3
months at a cinema. Back in the early days of cinema, with theaters that had
only one or two screens, only certain trailers were shown for the films that
were going to be shown there. Later, when theaters added more screens or new
theaters were built with a lot of screens, all different trailers were shown
even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater. Film studios
realized that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be
shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different
theater to see the film when it came out. The term "trailer" comes from their
having originally been shown at the end of a film program. That practice did
not last long because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films
ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the
"A film" in a double_feature program) begins. Film trailers are also common on
DVDs and Blu-ray_Discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Trailers
are created to be engaging and interesting for viewers. As a result, in the
Internet era, viewers often seek out trailers to watch them. Of the ten billion
videos watched online annually in 2008, film trailers ranked third, after news
and user-created videos.[13] Teasers are a much shorter preview or
advertisement that lasts only 10 to 30 seconds. Teasers are used to get patrons
excited about a film coming out in the next six to twelve months. Teasers may
be produced even before the film production is completed.
***** Education and propaganda *****
Main articles: Educational_film and Propaganda_film
Film is used for a range of goals, including education and propaganda. When the
purpose is primarily educational, a film is called an "educational_film".
Examples are recordings of academic lectures and experiments, or a film based
on a classic novel. Film may be propaganda, in whole or in part, such as the
films made by Leni_Riefenstahl in Nazi Germany, US war film trailers during
World War II, or artistic films made under Stalin by Eisenstein. They may also
be works of political protest, as in the films of Andrzej_Wajda, or more
subtly, the films of Andrei_Tarkovsky. The same film may be considered
educational by some, and propaganda by others as the categorization of a film
can be subjective.
***** Production *****
Main article: Filmmaking
At its core, the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker
wishes to show, and the apparatus for displaying it: the zoetrope merely
requires a series of images on a strip of paper. Film production can,
therefore, take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a
camera, as in Stan_Brakhage's 1963 film Mothlight), or thousands of actors,
extras, and crew members for a live-action, feature-length epic.
The necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception,
planning, execution, revision, and distribution. The more involved the
production, the more significant each of the steps becomes. In a typical
production_cycle of a Hollywood-style film, these main stages are defined as
development, pre-production, production, post-production and distribution.
This production cycle usually takes three years. The first year is taken up
with development. The second year comprises preproduction and production. The
third year, post-production and distribution. The bigger the production, the
more resources it takes, and the more important financing becomes; most feature
films are artistic works from the creators' perspective (e.g., film_director,
cinematographer, screenwriter) and for-profit business entities for the
production companies.
**** Crew ****
Main article: Film_crew
A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company, employed during the
"production" or "photography" phase, for the purpose of producing a film or
motion picture. Crew is distinguished from cast, who are the actors who appear
in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film. The crew
interacts with but is also distinct from the production staff, consisting of
producers, managers, company representatives, their assistants, and those whose
primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases, such
as screenwriters and film_editors. Communication between production and crew
generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants. Medium-
to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well-defined
hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the
departments. Other than acting, the crew handles everything in the photography
phase: props and costumes, shooting, sound, electrics (i.e., lights), sets, and
production special effects. Caterers (known in the film industry as "craft
services") are usually not considered part of the crew.
**** Technology ****
See also: Cinematic_techniques
Film_stock consists of transparent celluloid, acetate, or polyester base coated
with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was
the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its
flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the
film_format for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large
commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as 35 mm
prints. Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds
using hand-cranked cameras and projectors; though 1000 frames per minute (162/
3 frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates
most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18
frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should
be shown).[14] When sound_film was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant
speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second were chosen because
it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound
quality.[citation_needed] Improvements since the late 19th century include the
mechanization of cameras â allowing them to record at a consistent speed,
quiet camera design â allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without
requiring large "blimps" to encase the camera, the invention of more
sophisticated filmstocks and lenses, allowing directors to film in increasingly
dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be
recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack
can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action
pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.
As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology
developed as the basis for photography. It can be used to present a progressive
sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been
incorporated into multimedia presentations and often has importance as primary
historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of
preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many
alternatives. Most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern
safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of separation
masters: three B&W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters
(essentially a reverse of the Technicolor process). Digital methods have also
been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes
them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. Film_preservation
of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and
archivists and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in
order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase
revenue). Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-
strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black-and-white films on
safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to
keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.
Some films in recent decades have been recorded using analog video technology
similar to that used in television_production. Modern digital_video_cameras and
digital_projectors are gaining ground as well. These approaches are preferred
by some film-makers, especially because footage shot with digital_cinema can be
evaluated and edited with non-linear_editing_systems (NLE) without waiting for
the film stock to be processed. The migration was gradual, and as of 2005, most
major motion pictures were still shot on film.[needs_update]
**** Independent ****
Main article: Independent_film
[Auguste_and_Louis_LumiÃ¨re_brothers_seated_looking_left]
The_LumiÃ¨re_Brothers, who were among the first filmmakers
Independent filmmaking often takes place outside Hollywood, or other major
studio_systems. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially
produced without financing or distribution from a major_film_studio. Creative,
business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the
indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century. On the business side,
the costs of big-budget studio films also lead to conservative choices in cast
and crew. There is a trend in Hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds
of the films put out by Warner_Bros. in 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10%
in 1987).[15] A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a
job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry
experience in film or television. Also, the studios rarely produce films with
unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.
Before the advent of digital alternatives, the cost of professional film
equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star
in a traditional studio film. But the advent of consumer camcorders in 1985,
and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution digital_video in the early
1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to film production significantly.
Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; in
the 2000s, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a
commodity-based personal_computer. Technologies such as DVDs, FireWire
connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade video_editing
software make film-making relatively affordable.
Since the introduction of digital video DV technology, the means of production
have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot a film with a
digital video camera and edit the film, create and edit the sound and music,
and mix the final cut on a high-end home computer. However, while the means of
production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain
difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent
filmmakers rely on film_festivals to get their films noticed and sold for
distribution. The arrival of internet-based video websites such as YouTube and
Veoh has further changed the filmmaking landscape, enabling indie filmmakers to
make their films available to the public.
**** Open content film ****
Main article: Open_content_film
An open content film is much like an independent film, but it is produced
through open collaborations; its source material is available under a license
which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create fan_fiction or
derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like independent filmmaking,
open source filmmaking takes place outside Hollywood, or other major studio
systems.
**** Fan film ****
Main article: Fan_film
A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, television_program, comic
book or a similar source, created by fans rather than by the source's copyright
holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs, but some
of the most notable films have actually been produced by professional
filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films
vary tremendously in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent
motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures.
***** Distribution *****
Main articles: Film_distribution and Film_release
Film distribution is the process through which a film is made available for
viewing by an audience. This is normally the task of a professional film
distributor, who would determine the marketing strategy of the film, the media
by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing, and may set
the release_date and other matters. The film may be exhibited directly to the
public either through a movie_theater (historically the main way films were
distributed) or television for personal_home_viewing (including on DVD-Video or
Blu-ray_Disc, video-on-demand, online downloading, television_programs through
broadcast_syndication etc.). Other ways of distributing a film include rental
or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats, such as VHS
tape or DVD, or Internet downloading of streaming using a computer.
***** Animation *****
Main article: Animation
An animated image of a horse, made using eight pictures.
Animation is a technique in which each frame of a film is produced
individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a
drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see
claymation and stop_motion), and then photographing the result with a special
animation_camera. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is
viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of
continuous movement (due to the phi_phenomenon). Generating such a film is very
labor-intensive and tedious, though the development of computer_animation has
greatly sped up the process. Because animation is very time-consuming and often
very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for TV and films comes
from professional animation studios. However, the field of independent
animation has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced
by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent
animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.
Limited_animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of
animation by using "short cuts" in the animation process. This method was
pioneered by UPA and popularized by Hanna-Barbera in the United_States, and by
Osamu_Tezuka in Japan, and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from
movie_theaters to television.[16] Although most animation studios are now using
digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of
animation that depends on film. Camera-less animation, made famous by film-
makers like Norman_McLaren, Len_Lye, and Stan_Brakhage, is painted and drawn
directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.
