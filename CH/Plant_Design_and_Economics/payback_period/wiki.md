****** Payback period ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Payback period in capital_budgeting refers to the period of time required to
recoup the funds expended in an investment, or to reach the break-even_point.
[1] For example, a $1000 investment made at the start of year 1 which returned
$500 at the end of year 1 and year 2 respectively would have a two-year payback
period. Payback period is usually expressed in years. Starting from investment
year by calculating Net Cash Flow for each year: Net Cash Flow Year 1 = Cash
Inflow Year 1 - Cash Outflow Year 1. Then Cumulative Cash Flow = (Net Cash Flow
Year 1 + Net Cash Flow Year 2 + Net Cash Flow Year 3, etc.) Accumulate by year
until Cumulative Cash Flow is a positive number: that year is the payback year.
A simplified cash flow model shows the payback period as the time from the
project completion to the break-even. The payback period can be also calculated
from the beginning of the project. The approach is used in project management
simulation SimulTrain.
The time_value_of_money is not taken into account. Payback period intuitively
measures how long something takes to "pay for itself." All_else_being_equal,
shorter payback periods are preferable to longer payback periods. Payback
period is popular due to its ease of use despite the recognized limitations
described below.
The term is also widely used in other types of investment areas, often with
respect to energy_efficiency technologies, maintenance, upgrades, or other
changes. For example, a compact_fluorescent light bulb may be described as
having a payback period of a certain number of years or operating hours,
assuming certain costs. Here, the return to the investment consists of reduced
operating costs. Although primarily a financial term, the concept of a payback
period is occasionally extended to other uses, such as energy_payback_period[2]
[3] (the period of time over which the energy savings of a project equal the
amount of energy expended since project inception); these other terms may not
be standardized or widely used.

***** Purpose[edit] *****
Payback period as a tool of analysis is often used because it is easy to apply
and easy to understand for most individuals, regardless of academic training or
field of endeavor. When used carefully or to compare similar investments, it
can be quite useful. As a stand-alone tool to compare an investment to "doing
nothing," payback period has no explicit criteria for decision-making (except,
perhaps, that the payback period should be less than infinity).
The payback period is considered a method of analysis with serious limitations
and qualifications for its use, because it does not account for the time_value
of_money, risk, financing, or other important considerations, such as the
opportunity_cost. Whilst the time value of money can be rectified by applying a
weighted average cost of capital discount, it is generally agreed that this
tool for investment decisions should not be used in isolation. Alternative
measures of "return" preferred by economists are net_present_value and internal
rate_of_return. An implicit assumption in the use of payback period is that
returns to the investment continue after the payback period. Payback period
does not specify any required comparison to other investments or even to not
making an investment.
***** Construction[edit] *****
Payback period is usually expressed in years. Start by calculating Net Cash
Flow for each year: Net Cash Flow Year 1 = Cash Inflow Year 1 - Cash Outflow
Year 1. Then Cumulative Cash Flow = (Net Cash Flow Year 1 + Net Cash Flow Year
2 + Net Cash Flow Year 3, etc.) Accumulate by year until Cumulative Cash Flow
is a positive number: that year is the payback year.
To calculate a more exact payback period: Payback Period = Amount to be
Invested/Estimated Annual Net Cash Flow.[4]
It can also be calculated using the formula:
              Payback Period = (p - n)Ã·p  + ny
                             = 1 + ny - nÃ·p    (unit:years)
Where
ny= The number of years after the initial investment at which the last negative
value of cumulative cash flow occurs.
n= The value of cumulative cash flow at which the last negative value of
cumulative cash flow occurs.
p= The value of cash flow at which the first positive value of cumulative cash
flow occurs.
This formula can only be used to calculate the soonest payback period; that is,
the first period after which the investment has paid for itself. If the
cumulative cash flow drops to a negative value some time after it has reached a
positive value, thereby changing the payback period, this formula can't be
applied. This formula ignores values that arise after the payback period has
been reached.
Additional complexity arises when the cash flow changes sign several times;
i.e., it contains outflows in the midst or at the end of the project lifetime.
The modified payback period algorithm may be applied then. First, the sum of
all of the cash outflows is calculated. Then the cumulative positive cash flows
are determined for each period. The modified payback is calculated as the
moment in which the cumulative positive cash flow exceeds the total cash
outflow.
***** Shortcomings[edit] *****
Payback period doesn't take into consideration the time value of money and
therefore may not present the true picture when it comes to evaluating cash
flows of a project. This issue is addressed by using DPP, which uses discounted
cash flows. Payback also ignores the cash flows beyond the payback period. Most
major capital expenditures have a long life span and continue to provide cash
flows even after the payback period. Since the payback period focuses on short
term profitability, a valuable project may be overlooked if the payback period
is the only consideration.
