The particle-size distribution (PSD) of a powder, or granular material, or
particles dispersed in fluid, is a list of values or a mathematical function
that defines the relative amount, typically by mass, of particles present
according to size.[1] Significant energy is usually required to disintegrate
soil, etc. particles into the PSD that is then called a grain size
distribution.[2]

***** Significance[edit] *****
The PSD of a material can be important in understanding its physical and
chemical properties. It affects the strength and load-bearing properties of
rocks and soils. It affects the reactivity of solids participating in chemical
reactions, and needs to be tightly controlled in many industrial products such
as the manufacture of printer toner, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products.
***** Significance in the collection of particulate matter[edit] *****
Particle size distribution can greatly affect the efficiency of any collection
device.
Settling_chambers will normally only collect very large particles, those that
can be separated using sieve trays.
Centrifugal_collectors will normally collect particles down to about 20 Î¼m.
Higher efficiency models can collect particles down to 10 Î¼m.
Fabric_filters are one of the most efficient and cost effective types of dust
collectors available and can achieve a collection efficiency of more than 99%
for very fine particles.
Wet_scrubbers that use liquid are commonly known as wet scrubbers. In these
systems, the scrubbing liquid (usually water) comes into contact with a gas
stream containing dust particles. The greater the contact of the gas and liquid
streams, the higher the dust removal efficiency.
Electrostatic_precipitators use electrostatic forces to separate dust particles
from exhaust gases. They can be very efficient at the collection of very fine
particles.
Filter_Press used for filtering liquids by cake filtration mechanism. The PSD
plays an important part in the cake formation, cake resistance, and cake
characteristics. The filterability of the liquid is determined largely by the
size of the particles.
***** Nomenclature[edit] *****
Ïp: Actual particle density (g/cm3)
Ïg: Gas or sample matrix density (g/cm3)
r2: Least-squares coefficient_of_determination. The closer this value is to
1.0, the better the data fit to a hyperplane representing the relationship
between the response variable and a set of covariate variables. A value equal
to 1.0 indicates all data fit perfectly within the hyperplane.
Î»: Gas mean_free_path (cm)
D50: Mass-median-diameter (MMD). The log-normal distribution mass median
diameter. The MMD is considered to be the average particle diameter by mass.
Ïg: Geometric_standard_deviation. This value is determined mathematically by
the equation:
      Ïg = D84.13/D50 = D50/D15.87
The value of Ïg determines the slope of the least-squares regression curve.
Î±: Relative standard deviation or degree of polydispersity. This value is also
determined mathematically. For values less than 0.1, the particulate sample can
be considered to be monodisperse.
      Î± = Ïg/D50
Re(P) : Particle Reynolds_Number. In contrast to the large numerical values
noted for flow Reynolds number, particle Reynolds number for fine particles in
gaseous mediums is typically less than 0.1.
Ref : Flow Reynolds_number.
Kn: Particle Knudsen_number.
***** Types[edit] *****
The way PSD is usually defined by the method by which it is determined. The
most easily understood method of determination is sieve_analysis, where powder
is separated on sieves of different sizes. Thus, the PSD is defined in terms of
discrete size ranges: e.g. "% of sample between 45 Î¼m and 53 Î¼m", when sieves
of these sizes are used. The PSD is usually determined over a list of size
ranges that covers nearly all the sizes present in the sample. Some methods of
determination allow much narrower size ranges to be defined than can be
obtained by use of sieves, and are applicable to particle sizes outside the
range available in sieves. However, the idea of the notional "sieve", that
"retains" particles above a certain size, and "passes" particles below that
size, is universally used in presenting PSD data of all kinds.
The PSD may be expressed as a "range" analysis, in which the amount in each
size range is listed in order. It may also be presented in "cumulative" form,
in which the total of all sizes "retained" or "passed" by a single notional
"sieve" is given for a range of sizes. Range analysis is suitable when a
particular ideal mid-range particle size is being sought, while cumulative
analysis is used where the amount of "under-size" or "over-size" must be
controlled.
The way in which "size" is expressed is open to a wide range of
interpretations. A simple treatment assumes the particles are spheres that will
just pass through a square hole in a "sieve". In practice, particles are
irregular â often extremely so, for example in the case of fibrous materials
â and the way in which such particles are characterized during analysis is
very dependent on the method of measurement used.
***** Sampling[edit] *****
Before a PSD can be determined, it is vital that a representative sample is
obtained. In the case where the material to be analysed is flowing, the sample
must be withdrawn from the stream in such a way that the sample has the same
proportions of particle sizes as the stream. The best way to do this is to take
many samples of the whole stream over a period, instead of taking a portion of
the stream for the whole time.[3]p. 6 In the case where the material is in a
heap, scoop or thief sampling needs to be done, which is inaccurate: the sample
should ideally have been taken while the powder was flowing towards the heap.
[3]p. 10 After sampling, the sample volume typically needs to be reduced. The
material to be analysed must be carefully blended, and the sample withdrawn
using techniques that avoid size segregation, for example using a rotary
divider[3]p. 5. Particular attention must be paid to avoidance of loss of fines
during manipulation of the sample.
***** Measurement techniques[edit] *****
**** Sieve analysis[edit] ****
This continues to be used for many measurements because of its simplicity,
cheapness, and ease of interpretation. Methods may be simple shaking of the
sample in sieves until the amount retained becomes more or less constant.
Alternatively, the sample may be washed through with a non-reacting liquid
(usually water) or blown through with an air current.
Advantages: this technique is well-adapted for bulk materials. A large amount
of materials can be readily loaded into 8-inch-diameter (200 mm) sieve trays.
Two common uses in the powder industry are wet-sieving of milled limestone and
dry-sieving of milled coal.
Disadvantages: many PSDs are concerned with particles too small for separation
by sieving to be practical. A very fine sieve, such as 37 Î¼m sieve, is
exceedingly fragile, and it is very difficult to get material to pass through
it. Another disadvantage is that the amount of energy used to sieve the sample
is arbitrarily determined. Over-energetic sieving causes attrition of the
particles and thus changes the PSD, while insufficient energy fails to break
down loose agglomerates. Although manual sieving procedures can be ineffective,
automated sieving technologies using image fragmentation_analysis software are
available. These technologies can sieve material by capturing and analyzing a
photo of material.
**** Air elutriation analysis[edit] ****
Material may be separated by means of an elutriator, which consists of a
vertical tube up which fluid is passed at a controlled velocity. When the
particles are introduced, often through a side tube, the smaller particles are
carried over in the fluid stream while the large particles settle against the
upward current. If we start with low flow rates small less dense particle
attain terminal velocities, and flow with the stream, the particle from the
stream is collected in overflow and hence will be separated from the feed. Flow
rates can be increased to separate higher size ranges. Further size fractions
may be collected if the overflow from the first tube is passed vertically
upwards through a second tube of greater cross-section, and any number of such
tubes can be arranged in series.
Advantages: a bulk sample is analyzed using centrifugal classification and the
technique is non-destructive. Each cut-point can be recovered for future size-
respective chemical analyses. This technique has been used for decades in the
air pollution control industry (data used for design of control devices). This
technique determines particle size as a function of settling velocity in an air
stream (as opposed to water, or some other liquid).
Disadvantages: a bulk sample (about ten grams) must be obtained. It is a fairly
time-consuming analytical technique. The actual test method [4] has been
withdrawn by ASME due to obsolescence. Instrument calibration materials are
therefore no longer available.
**** Photoanalysis[edit] ****
Main article: Optical_granulometry
Materials can now be analysed through photoanalysis procedures. Unlike sieve
analyses which can be time-consuming and inaccurate, taking a photo of a sample
of the materials to be measured and using software to analyze the photo can
result in rapid, accurate measurements. Another advantage is that the material
can be analyzed without being handled. This is beneficial in the agricultural
industry, as handling of food products can lead to contamination. Photoanalysis
equipment and software is currently being used in mining, forestry and
agricultural industries worldwide.
**** Optical counting methods[edit] ****
PSDs can be measured microscopically by sizing against a graticule and
counting, but for a statistically valid analysis, millions of particles must be
measured. This is impossibly arduous when done manually, but automated analysis
of electron_micrographs is now commercially available. It is used to determine
the particle size within the range of 0.2 to 100 micrometers.
**** Electroresistance counting methods[edit] ****
An example of this is the Coulter_counter, which measures the momentary changes
in the conductivity of a liquid passing through an orifice that take place when
individual non-conducting particles pass through. The particle count is
obtained by counting pulses. This pulse is proportional to the volume of the
sensed particle.
Advantages: very small sample aliquots can be examined.
Disadvantages: sample must be dispersed in a liquid medium... some particles
may (partially or fully) dissolve in the medium altering the size distribution.
The results are only related to the projected cross-sectional area that a
particle displaces as it passes through an orifice. This is a physical
diameter, not really related to mathematical descriptions of particles (e.g.
terminal_settling_velocity).
**** Sedimentation techniques[edit] ****
These are based upon study of the terminal velocity acquired by particles
suspended in a viscous liquid. Sedimentation time is longest for the finest
particles, so this technique is useful for sizes below 10 Î¼m, but sub-
micrometer particles cannot be reliably measured due to the effects of Brownian
motion. Typical apparatus disperses the sample in liquid, then measures the
density of the column at timed intervals. Other techniques determine the
optical density of successive layers using visible light or x-rays.
Advantages: this technique determines particle size as a function of settling
velocity.
Disadvantages: Sample must be dispersed in a liquid medium... some particles
may (partially or fully) dissolve in the medium altering the size distribution,
requiring careful selection of the dispersion media. Density is highly
dependent upon fluid temperature remaining constant. X-Rays will not count
carbon (organic) particles. Many of these instruments can require a bulk sample
(e.g. two to five grams).
**** Laser diffraction methods[edit] ****
These depend upon analysis of the "halo" of diffracted light produced when a
laser beam passes through a dispersion of particles in air or in a liquid. The
angle of diffraction increases as particle size decreases, so that this method
is particularly good for measuring sizes between 0.1 and 3,000 Î¼m. Advances in
sophisticated data processing and automation have allowed this to become the
dominant method used in industrial PSD determination. This technique is
relatively fast and can be performed on very small samples. A particular
advantage is that the technique can generate a continuous measurement for
analyzing process streams. Laser diffraction measures particle size
distributions by measuring the angular variation in intensity of light
scattered as a laser beam passes through a dispersed particulate sample. Large
particles scatter light at small angles relative to the laser beam and small
particles scatter light at large angles, as illustrated below. The angular
scattering intensity data is then analyzed to calculate the size of the
particles responsible for creating the scattering pattern, using the Mie theory
or Fraunhofer_approximation of light scattering. The particle size is reported
as a volume equivalent sphere diameter.
**** Laser Obscuration Time" (LOT) or "Time Of Transition" (TOT)[edit] ****
A focused laser beam rotates in a constant frequency and interacts with
particles within the sample medium. Each randomly scanned particle obscures the
laser beam to its dedicated photo diode, which measures the time of
obscuration.
The time of obscuration directly relates to the particle's Diameter, by a
simple calculation principle of multiplying the known beam rotation Velocity in
the directly measured Time of obscuration, (D=V*t).
**** Acoustic spectroscopy or ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy[edit] ****
Instead of light, this method employs ultrasound for collecting information on
the particles that are dispersed in fluid. Dispersed_particles absorb and
scatter ultrasound similarly to light. This has been known since Lord_Rayleigh
developed the first theory of ultrasound scattering and published a book "The
Theory of Sound" in 1878.[5] There have been hundreds of papers studying
ultrasound propagation through fluid particulates in the 20th century.[6] It
turns out that instead of measuring scattered energy versus angle, as with
light, in the case of ultrasound, measuring the transmitted energy versus
frequency is a better choice. The resulting ultrasound attenuation frequency
spectra are the raw data for calculating particle size distribution. It can be
measured for any fluid system with no dilution or other sample preparation.
This is a big advantage of this method. Calculation of particle size
distribution is based on theoretical models that are well verified for up to
50% by volume of dispersed particles. However, as concentration increases and
the particle sizes approach the nanoscale, conventional modelling gives way to
the necessity to include shear-wave re-conversion effects in order for the
models to accurately reflect the real attenuation spectra.[7]
**** Air pollution emissions measurements[edit] ****
Cascade impactors â particulate matter is withdrawn isokinetically from a
source and segregated by size in a cascade_impactor at the sampling point
exhaust conditions of temperature, pressure, etc. Cascade impactors use the
principle of inertial separation to size segregate particle samples from a
particle laden gas stream. The mass of each size fraction is determined
gravimetrically. The California Air Resources Board Method 501[8] is currently
the most widely accepted test method for particle size distribution emissions
measurements.
***** Mathematical models[edit] *****
**** Probability distributions[edit] ****
    * The log-normal_distribution is often used to approximate the particle
      size distribution of aerosols, aquatic particles and pulverized material.
    * The Weibull_distribution or RosinâRammler distribution is a useful
      distribution for representing particle size distributions generated by
      grinding, milling and crushing operations.
    * The log-hyperbolic distribution was proposed by Bagnold and Barndorff-
      Nielsen[9] to model the particle-size distribution of naturally occurring
      sediments. This model suffers from having non-unique solutions for a
      range of probability coefficients.
    * The skew log-Laplace model was proposed by Fieller, Gilbertson and
      Olbricht [10] as a simpler alternative to the log-hyperbolic
      distribution.
*** RosinâRammler distribution[edit] ***
The Weibull_distribution, now named for Waloddi_Weibull was first identified by
FrÃ©chet_(1927) and first applied by Rosin_&_Rammler_(1933) to describe
particle size distributions. It is still widely used in mineral_processing to
describe particle size distributions in comminution processes.
         f ( x ;  P   80    , m ) =   {    1 &#x2212;  e  ln &#x2061;  ( 0.2 )

      {\displaystyle f(x;P_{\rm {80}},m)={\begin{cases}1-e^{\ln \left

      0,\\0&x<0,\end{cases}}}  [{\displaystyle f(x;P_{\rm {80}},m)={\begin
      {cases}1-e^{\ln \left(0.2\right)\left({\frac {x}{P_{\rm {80}}}}\right)^
      {m}}&x\geq 0,\\0&x<0,\end{cases}}}]
where
         x   {\displaystyle x}  [x]: Particle size
          P   80      {\displaystyle P_{\rm {80}}}  [P_{\rm{80}}]: 80th
      percentile of the particle size distribution
         m   {\displaystyle m}  [m]: Parameter describing the spread of the
      distribution
The inverse distribution is given by:
         f ( F ;  P   80    , m ) =   {     P   80        ln &#x2061; ( 1
      &#x2212; F )   ln &#x2061; ( 0.2 )    m      F > 0 ,     0   F &#x2264; 0
      ,         {\displaystyle f(F;P_{\rm {80}},m)={\begin{cases}P_{\rm {80}}
      {\sqrt[{m}]{\frac {\ln(1-F)}{\ln(0.2)}}}&F>0,\\0&F\leq 0,\end{cases}}}  [
      {\displaystyle f(F;P_{\rm {80}},m)={\begin{cases}P_{\rm {80}}{\sqrt[{m}]
      {\frac {\ln(1-F)}{\ln(0.2)}}}&F>0,\\0&F\leq 0,\end{cases}}}]
where
         F   {\displaystyle F}  [F]: Mass fraction
** Parameter estimation[edit] **
The parameters of the RosinâRammler distribution can be determined by
refactoring the distribution function to the form[11]
         ln &#x2061;  (  &#x2212; ln &#x2061;  (  1 &#x2212; F )  )   )  = m ln
      &#x2061; ( x ) + ln &#x2061;  (    &#x2212; ln &#x2061; ( 0.2 )   (  P
      80     )  m      )    {\displaystyle \ln \left(-\ln \left(1-
      F)\right)\right)=m\ln(x)+\ln \left({\frac {-\ln(0.2)}{(P_{\rm {80}})^
      {m}}}\right)}  [\ln \left(-\ln \left(1-F)\right)\right)=m\ln(x)+\ln \left
      ({\frac  {-\ln(0.2)}{(P_{{{\rm {{80}}}}})^{m}}}\right)]
Hence the slope of the line in a plot of
         ln &#x2061;  (  &#x2212; ln &#x2061;  (  1 &#x2212; F )  )   )
      {\displaystyle \ln \left(-\ln \left(1-F)\right)\right)}  [\ln \left(-\ln
      \left(1-F)\right)\right)] versus     ln &#x2061; ( x )   {\displaystyle
      \ln(x)}  [\ln(x)]
yields the parameter     m   {\displaystyle m}  [m] and      P   80
{\displaystyle P_{\rm {80}}}  [P_{\rm{80}}] is determined by substitution into
          P   80    =   (    &#x2212; ln &#x2061; ( 0.2 )   e  i n t e r c e p
      t     )    1 m      {\displaystyle P_{\rm {80}}=\left({\frac {-\ln(0.2)}
      {e^{intercept}}}\right)^{\frac {1}{m}}}  [P_{{{\rm {{80}}}}}=\left({\frac
      {-\ln(0.2)}{e^{{intercept}}}}\right)^{{\frac  {1}{m}}}]
