Pressure (symbol: p or P) is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of
an object per unit area over which that force is distributed. Gauge_pressure
(also spelled gage pressure)[a] is the pressure relative to the ambient
pressure.
Various units are used to express pressure. Some of these derive from a unit of
force divided by a unit of area; the SI unit of pressure, the pascal (Pa), for
example, is one newton per square_metre(N/m2); similarly, the pound-force per
square_inch (psi) is the traditional unit of pressure in the imperial and US
customary systems. Pressure may also be expressed in terms of standard
atmospheric_pressure; the atmosphere (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the
torr is defined as &#x200b;1⁄760 of this. Manometric units such as the
centimetre_of_water, millimetre_of_mercury, and inch_of_mercury are used to
express pressures in terms of the height of column_of_a_particular_fluid in a
manometer.

***** Definition[edit] *****
Pressure is the amount of force applied at right_angles to the surface of an
object per unit area. The symbol for it is p or P.[1] The IUPAC recommendation
for pressure is a lower-case p.[2] However, upper-case P is widely used. The
usage of P vs p depends upon the field in which one is working, on the nearby
presence of other symbols for quantities such as power and momentum, and on
writing style.

Mathematically:
         p =   F A   ,   {\displaystyle p={\frac {F}{A}},}  [{\displaystyle p=
      {\frac {F}{A}},}][3]
where:
         p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] is the pressure,
         F   {\displaystyle F}  [F] is the magnitude of the normal_force,
         A   {\displaystyle A}  [A] is the area of the surface on contact.
Pressure is a scalar quantity. It relates the vector_area element (a vector
normal to the surface) with the normal_force acting on it. The pressure is the
scalar proportionality_constant that relates the two normal vectors:
         d   F   n   = &#x2212; p  d  A  = &#x2212; p   n   d A .
      {\displaystyle d\mathbf {F} _{n}=-p\,d\mathbf {A} =-p\,\mathbf {n} \,dA.}
      [{\displaystyle d\mathbf {F} _{n}=-p\,d\mathbf {A} =-p\,\mathbf {n}
      \,dA.}]
The minus sign comes from the fact that the force is considered towards the
surface element, while the normal vector points outward. The equation has
meaning in that, for any surface S in contact with the fluid, the total force
exerted by the fluid on that surface is the surface_integral over S of the
right-hand side of the above equation.
It is incorrect (although rather usual) to say "the pressure is directed in
such or such direction". The pressure, as a scalar, has no direction. The force
given by the previous relationship to the quantity has a direction, but the
pressure does not. If we change the orientation of the surface element, the
direction of the normal force changes accordingly, but the pressure remains the
same.
Pressure is distributed to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of
fluid normal to these boundaries or sections at every point. It is a
fundamental parameter in thermodynamics, and it is conjugate to volume.
**** Units[edit] ****
Mercury column
The SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa), equal to one newton per square
metre (N/m2, or kgÂ·mâ1Â·sâ2). This name for the unit was added in 1971;[4]
before that, pressure in SI was expressed simply in newtons per square metre.
Other units of pressure, such as pounds_per_square_inch (Ibf/in2)and bar, are
also in common use. The CGS unit of pressure is the barye (Ba), equal to
1 dynÂ·cmâ2, or 0.1 Pa. Pressure is sometimes expressed in grams-force or
kilograms-force per square centimetre (g/cm2 or kg/cm2) and the like without
properly identifying the force units. But using the names kilogram, gram,
kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as units of force is expressly
forbidden in SI. The technical_atmosphere (symbol: at) is 1 kgf/cm2
(98.0665 kPa, or 14.223 psi).
Since a system under pressure has the potential to perform work on its
surroundings, pressure is a measure of potential energy stored per unit volume.
It is therefore related to energy density and may be expressed in units such as
joules per cubic metre (J/m3, which is equal to Pa). Mathematically:
         p =    F &#x00D7;  distance    A &#x00D7;  distance     =   work
      volume   =   energy (J)   volume&#xA0;  (   m   3   )    .
      {\displaystyle p={\frac {F\times {\text{distance}}}{A\times {\text
      {distance}}}}={\frac {\text{work}}{\text{volume}}}={\frac {\text{energy
      (J)}}{{\text{volume }}({\text{m}}^{3})}}.}  [{\displaystyle p={\frac
      {F\times {\text{distance}}}{A\times {\text{distance}}}}={\frac {\text
      {work}}{\text{volume}}}={\frac {\text{energy (J)}}{{\text{volume }}(
      {\text{m}}^{3})}}.}]
Some meteorologists prefer the hectopascal (hPa) for atmospheric air pressure,
which is equivalent to the older unit millibar (mbar). Similar pressures are
given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, where the hecto- prefix is
rarely used. The inch of mercury is still used in the United States.
Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in decibars (dbar) because
pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth.
The standard_atmosphere (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately
equal to typical air pressure at Earth mean_sea_level and is defined as
101325 Pa.
Because pressure is commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of
liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular
fluid (e.g., centimetres_of_water, millimetres_of_mercury or inches_of
mercury). The most common choices are mercury (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic
and readily available, while mercury's high density allows a shorter column
(and so a smaller manometer) to be used to measure a given pressure. The
pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height h and density Ï is given by
the hydrostatic pressure equation p = Ïgh, where g is the gravitational
acceleration. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to
another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not
define pressure precisely. When millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury are
quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury;
rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms
of SI units.[citation_needed] One millimetre of mercury is approximately equal
to one torr. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a
measured, rather than defined, quantity. These manometric units are still
encountered in many fields. Blood_pressure is measured in millimetres of
mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are
still common.
Underwater_divers use the metre_sea_water (msw or MSW) and foot_sea_water (fsw
or FSW) units of pressure, and these are the standard units for pressure gauges
used to measure pressure exposure in diving_chambers and personal_decompression
computers. A msw is defined as 0.1 bar (= 100000 Pa = 10000 Pa), is not the
same as a linear metre of depth. 33.066 fsw = 1 atm[5] (1 atm = 101325 Pa /
33.066 = 3064.326 Pa). Note that the pressure conversion from msw to fsw is
different from the length conversion: 10 msw = 32.6336 fsw, while 10 m =
32.8083 ft.[6]
Gauge pressure is often given in units with "g" appended, e.g. "kPag", "barg"
or "psig", and units for measurements of absolute pressure are sometimes given
a suffix of "a", to avoid confusion, for example "kPaa", "psia". However, the
US National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology recommends that, to avoid
confusion, any modifiers be instead applied to the quantity being measured
rather than the unit of measure.[7] For example, "pg = 100 psi" rather than "p
= 100 psig".
Differential pressure is expressed in units with "d" appended; this type of
measurement is useful when considering sealing performance or whether a valve
will open or close.
Presently or formerly popular pressure units include the following:
    * atmosphere (atm)
    * manometric units:
          o centimetre, inch, millimetre (torr) and micrometre (mTorr, micron)
            of mercury,
          o height of equivalent column of water, including millimetre (mm H
            2O), centimetre (cm H
            2O), metre, inch, and foot of water;
    * imperial and customary units:
          o kip, short_ton-force, long_ton-force, pound-force, ounce-force, and
            poundal per square inch,
          o short ton-force and long ton-force per square inch,
          o fsw (feet sea water) used in underwater diving, particularly in
            connection with diving pressure exposure and decompression;
    * non-SI metric units:
          o bar, decibar, millibar,
                # msw (metres sea water), used in underwater diving,
                  particularly in connection with diving pressure exposure and
                  decompression,
          o kilogram-force, or kilopond, per square centimetre (technical
            atmosphere),
          o gram-force and tonne-force (metric ton-force) per square
            centimetre,
          o barye (dyne per square centimetre),
          o kilogram-force and tonne-force per square metre,
          o sthene per square metre (pieze).

**** Examples[edit] ****
The effects of an external pressure of 700 bar on an aluminum cylinder with
5 mm (0.197 in) wall thickness
As an example of varying pressures, a finger can be pressed against a wall
without making any lasting impression; however, the same finger pushing a
thumbtack can easily damage the wall. Although the force applied to the surface
is the same, the thumbtack applies more pressure because the point concentrates
that force into a smaller area. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or
across arbitrary sections of fluid normal to these boundaries or sections at
every point. Unlike stress, pressure is defined as a scalar_quantity. The
negative gradient of pressure is called the force_density.
Another example is a knife. If we try to cut with the flat edge, force is
distributed over a larger surface area resulting in less pressure, and it will
not cut. Whereas using the sharp edge, which has less surface area, results in
greater pressure, and so the knife cuts smoothly. This is one example of a
practical application of pressure.
For gases, pressure is sometimes measured not as an absolute pressure, but
relative to atmospheric_pressure; such measurements are called gauge pressure.
An example of this is the air pressure in an automobile tire, which might be
said to be "220 kPa (32 psi)", but is actually 220 kPa (32 psi) above
atmospheric pressure. Since atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 100 kPa
(14.7 psi), the absolute pressure in the tire is therefore about 320 kPa
(46 psi). In technical work, this is written "a gauge pressure of 220 kPa
(32 psi)". Where space is limited, such as on pressure_gauges, name_plates,
graph labels, and table headings, the use of a modifier in parentheses, such as
"kPa (gauge)" or "kPa (absolute)", is permitted. In non-SI technical work, a
gauge pressure of 32 psi (220 kPa) is sometimes written as "32 psig", and an
absolute pressure as "32 psia", though the other methods explained above that
avoid attaching characters to the unit of pressure are preferred.[8]
Gauge pressure is the relevant measure of pressure wherever one is interested
in the stress on storage_vessels and the plumbing components of fluidics
systems. However, whenever equation-of-state properties, such as densities or
changes in densities, must be calculated, pressures must be expressed in terms
of their absolute values. For instance, if the atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa
(15 psi), a gas (such as helium) at 200 kPa (29 psi) (gauge) (300 kPa or 44 psi
[absolute]) is 50% denser than the same gas at 100 kPa (15 psi) (gauge)
(200 kPa or 29 psi [absolute]). Focusing on gauge values, one might erroneously
conclude the first sample had twice the density of the second one.
**** Scalar nature[edit] ****
In a static gas, the gas as a whole does not appear to move. The individual
molecules of the gas, however, are in constant random_motion. Because we are
dealing with an extremely large number of molecules and because the motion of
the individual molecules is random in every direction, we do not detect any
motion. If we enclose the gas within a container, we detect a pressure in the
gas from the molecules colliding with the walls of our container. We can put
the walls of our container anywhere inside the gas, and the force per unit area
(the pressure) is the same. We can shrink the size of our "container" down to a
very small point (becoming less true as we approach the atomic scale), and the
pressure will still have a single value at that point. Therefore, pressure is a
scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has magnitude but no direction sense
associated with it. Pressure force acts in all directions at a point inside a
gas. At the surface of a gas, the pressure force acts perpendicular (at right
angle) to the surface.
A closely related quantity is the stress tensor Ï, which relates the vector
force      F    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }  [\mathbf {F} ] to the vector_area
A    {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }  [\mathbf {A} ] via the linear relation
F  = &#x03C3;  A    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\sigma \mathbf {A} }  [
{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\sigma \mathbf {A} }].
This tensor may be expressed as the sum of the viscous_stress_tensor minus the
hydrostatic pressure. The negative of the stress tensor is sometimes called the
pressure tensor, but in the following, the term "pressure" will refer only to
the scalar pressure.
According to the theory of general_relativity, pressure increases the strength
of a gravitational field (see stressâenergy_tensor) and so adds to the mass-
energy cause of gravity. This effect is unnoticeable at everyday pressures but
is significant in neutron_stars, although it has not been experimentally
tested.[9]
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Fluid pressure[edit] ****
Fluid pressure is most often the compressive stress at some point within a
fluid. (The term fluid refers to both liquids and gases â for more
information specifically about liquid pressure, see section_below.)
Water shooting out a damaged hydrant at high pressure
Fluid pressure occurs in one of two situations:
   1. An open condition, called "open channel flow", e.g. the ocean, a swimming
      pool, or the atmosphere.
   2. A closed condition, called "closed conduit", e.g. a water line or gas
      line.
Pressure in open conditions usually can be approximated as the pressure in
"static" or non-moving conditions (even in the ocean where there are waves and
currents), because the motions create only negligible changes in the pressure.
Such conditions conform with principles of fluid_statics. The pressure at any
given point of a non-moving (static) fluid is called the hydrostatic pressure.
Closed bodies of fluid are either "static", when the fluid is not moving, or
"dynamic", when the fluid can move as in either a pipe or by compressing an air
gap in a closed container. The pressure in closed conditions conforms with the
principles of fluid_dynamics.
The concepts of fluid pressure are predominantly attributed to the discoveries
of Blaise_Pascal and Daniel_Bernoulli. Bernoulli's_equation can be used in
almost any situation to determine the pressure at any point in a fluid. The
equation makes some assumptions about the fluid, such as the fluid being ideal
[10] and incompressible.[10] An ideal fluid is a fluid in which there is no
friction, it is inviscid [10] (zero viscosity).[10] The equation for all points
of a system filled with a constant-density fluid is[11]
           p &#x03B3;   +    v  2    2 g    + z =  c o n s t  ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{\gamma }}+{\frac {v^{2}}{2g}}+z=\mathrm {const}
      ,}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {p}{\gamma }}+{\frac {v^{2}}{2g}}+z=\mathrm
      {const} ,}]
where:
      p = pressure of the fluid,
          &#x03B3;    {\displaystyle {\gamma }}  [{\gamma }] = Ïg = density Â·
      acceleration of gravity = specific_weight of the fluid,[10]
      v = velocity of the fluid,
      g = acceleration_of_gravity,
      z = elevation,
           p &#x03B3;     {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{\gamma }}}  [{\frac {p}
      {\gamma }}] = pressure head,
            v  2    2 g      {\displaystyle {\frac {v^{2}}{2g}}}  [\frac{v^2}
      {2g}] = velocity head.

**** Explosion or deflagration pressures[edit] ****
Explosion or deflagration pressures are the result of the ignition of explosive
gases, mists, dust/air suspensions, in unconfined and confined spaces.
**** Negative pressures[edit] ****
Low-pressure chamber in Bundesleistungszentrum_Kienbaum, Germany
While pressures are, in general, positive, there are several situations in
which negative pressures may be encountered:
    * When dealing in relative (gauge) pressures. For instance, an absolute
      pressure of 80 kPa may be described as a gauge pressure of â21 kPa
      (i.e., 21 kPa below an atmospheric pressure of 101 kPa).
    * When attractive intermolecular_forces (e.g., van_der_Waals_forces or
      hydrogen_bonds) between the particles of a fluid exceed repulsive forces
      due to thermal motion. These forces explain ascent_of_sap in tall plants.
      A negative pressure acts on water molecules at the top of any tree taller
      than 10 m, which is the pressure_head of water that balances the
      atmospheric pressure. Intermolecular forces maintain cohesion of columns
      of sap that run continuously in xylem from the roots to the top leaves.
      [12]
    * The Casimir_effect can create a small attractive force due to
      interactions with vacuum_energy; this force is sometimes termed "vacuum
      pressure" (not to be confused with the negative gauge pressure of a
      vacuum).
    * For non-isotropic stresses in rigid bodies, depending on how the
      orientation of a surface is chosen, the same distribution of forces may
      have a component of positive pressure along one surface_normal, with a
      component of negative pressure acting along another surface normal.
          o The stresses in an electromagnetic_field are generally non-
            isotropic, with the pressure normal to one surface element (the
            normal_stress) being negative, and positive for surface elements
            perpendicular to this.
    * In the cosmological_constant.
**** Stagnation pressure[edit] ****
Stagnation_pressure is the pressure a fluid exerts when it is forced to stop
moving. Consequently, although a fluid moving at higher speed will have a lower
static_pressure, it may have a higher stagnation pressure when forced to a
standstill. Static pressure and stagnation pressure are related by:
          p  0   =   1 2   &#x03C1;  v  2   + p   {\displaystyle p_{0}={\frac
      {1}{2}}\rho v^{2}+p}  [p_{0} = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + p]
where
          p  0     {\displaystyle p_{0}}  [p_{0}] is the stagnation_pressure
         v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] is the flow velocity
         p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] is the static pressure.
The pressure of a moving fluid can be measured using a Pitot_tube, or one of
its variations such as a Kiel_probe or Cobra_probe, connected to a manometer.
Depending on where the inlet holes are located on the probe, it can measure
static pressures or stagnation pressures.
**** Surface pressure and surface tension[edit] ****
There is a two-dimensional analog of pressure â the lateral force per unit
length applied on a line perpendicular to the force.
Surface pressure is denoted by Ï:
         &#x03C0; =   F l     {\displaystyle \pi ={\frac {F}{l}}}  [\pi = \frac
      {F}{l}]
and shares many similar properties with three-dimensional pressure. Properties
of surface chemicals can be investigated by measuring pressure/area isotherms,
as the two-dimensional analog of Boyle's_law, ÏA = k, at constant temperature.
Surface_tension is another example of surface pressure, but with a reversed
sign, because "tension" is the opposite to "pressure".
**** Pressure of an ideal gas[edit] ****
Main article: Ideal_gas_law
In an ideal_gas, molecules have no volume and do not interact. According to the
ideal_gas_law, pressure varies linearly with temperature and quantity, and
inversely with volume:
         p =    n R T  V   ,   {\displaystyle p={\frac {nRT}{V}},}  [
      {\displaystyle p={\frac {nRT}{V}},}]
where:
      p is the absolute pressure of the gas,
      n is the amount_of_substance,
      T is the absolute temperature,
      V is the volume,
      R is the ideal_gas_constant.
Real_gases exhibit a more complex dependence on the variables of state.[13]
**** Vapour pressure[edit] ****
Main article: Vapour_pressure
Vapour pressure is the pressure of a vapour in thermodynamic_equilibrium with
its condensed phases in a closed system. All liquids and solids have a tendency
to evaporate into a gaseous form, and all gases have a tendency to condense
back to their liquid or solid form.
The atmospheric_pressure boiling_point of a liquid (also known as the normal
boiling_point) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the
ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that
temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric
pressure and lift the liquid to form vapour bubbles inside the bulk of the
substance. Bubble formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher pressure,
and therefore higher temperature, because the fluid pressure increases above
the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases.
The vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the
total pressure in the system is called partial_vapor_pressure.

When a person swims under the water, water pressure is felt acting on the
person's eardrums. The deeper that person swims, the greater the pressure. The
pressure felt is due to the weight of the water above the person. As someone
swims deeper, there is more water above the person and therefore greater
pressure. The pressure a liquid exerts depends on its depth.
Liquid pressure also depends on the density of the liquid. If someone was
submerged in a liquid more dense than water, the pressure would be
correspondingly greater. thus we can say that the depth, density and liquid
pressure are directly proportionate. The pressure due to a liquid in liquid
columns of constant density or at a depth within a substance is represented by
the following formula:
         p = &#x03C1; g h ,   {\displaystyle p=\rho gh,}  [{\displaystyle
      p=\rho gh,}]
where:
      p is liquid pressure,
      g is gravity at the surface of overlaying material,
      Ï is density of liquid,
      h is height of liquid column or depth within a substance.
Another way of saying the same formula is the following:
         p =  weight density  &#x00D7;  depth  .   {\displaystyle p={\text
      {weight density}}\times {\text{depth}}.}  [{\displaystyle p={\text{weight
      density}}\times {\text{depth}}.}]
Derivation of this equation
This is derived from the definitions of pressure and weight density. Consider
an area at the bottom of a vessel of liquid. The weight of the column of liquid
directly above this area produces pressure. From the definition
          weight density  =   weight volume     {\displaystyle {\text{weight
      density}}={\frac {\text{weight}}{\text{volume}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\text
      {weight density}}={\frac {\text{weight}}{\text{volume}}}}]
we can express this weight of liquid as
          weight  =  weight density  &#x00D7;  volume  ,   {\displaystyle
      {\text{weight}}={\text{weight density}}\times {\text{volume}},}  [
      {\displaystyle {\text{weight}}={\text{weight density}}\times {\text
      {volume}},}]
where the volume of the column is simply the area multiplied by the depth. Then
we have
          pressure  =   force area   =   weight area   =     weight density
      &#x00D7;  volume   area   ,   {\displaystyle {\text{pressure}}={\frac
      {\text{force}}{\text{area}}}={\frac {\text{weight}}{\text{area}}}={\frac
      {{\text{weight density}}\times {\text{volume}}}{\text{area}}},}  [
      {\displaystyle {\text{pressure}}={\frac {\text{force}}{\text{area}}}=
      {\frac {\text{weight}}{\text{area}}}={\frac {{\text{weight
      density}}\times {\text{volume}}}{\text{area}}},}]
          pressure  =     weight density  &#x00D7;  (area  &#x00D7;  depth)
      area   .   {\displaystyle {\text{pressure}}={\frac {{\text{weight
      density}}\times {\text{(area}}\times {\text{depth)}}}{\text{area}}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle {\text{pressure}}={\frac {{\text{weight density}}\times
      {\text{(area}}\times {\text{depth)}}}{\text{area}}}.}]
With the "area" in the numerator and the "area" in the denominator canceling
each other out, we are left with
          pressure  =  weight density  &#x00D7;  depth  .   {\displaystyle
      {\text{pressure}}={\text{weight density}}\times {\text{depth}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle {\text{pressure}}={\text{weight density}}\times {\text
      {depth}}.}]
Written with symbols, this is our original equation:
         p = &#x03C1; g h .   {\displaystyle p=\rho gh.}  [{\displaystyle
      p=\rho gh.}]
The pressure a liquid exerts against the sides and bottom of a container
depends on the density and the depth of the liquid. If atmospheric pressure is
neglected, liquid pressure against the bottom is twice as great at twice the
depth; at three times the depth, the liquid pressure is threefold; etc. Or, if
the liquid is two or three times as dense, the liquid pressure is
correspondingly two or three times as great for any given depth. Liquids are
practically incompressible â that is, their volume can hardly be changed by
pressure (water volume decreases by only 50 millionths of its original volume
for each atmospheric increase in pressure). Thus, except for small changes
produced by temperature, the density of a particular liquid is practically the
same at all depths.
Atmospheric pressure pressing on the surface of a liquid must be taken into
account when trying to discover the total pressure acting on a liquid. The
total pressure of a liquid, then, is Ïgh plus the pressure of the atmosphere.
When this distinction is important, the term total pressure is used. Otherwise,
discussions of liquid pressure refer to pressure without regard to the normally
ever-present atmospheric pressure.
It is important to recognize that the pressure does not depend on the amount of
liquid present. Volume is not the important factor â depth is. The average
water pressure acting against a dam depends on the average depth of the water
and not on the volume of water held back. For example, a wide but shallow lake
with a depth of 3 m (10 ft) exerts only half the average pressure that a small
6 m (20 ft) deep pond does (note that the total force applied to the longer dam
will be greater, due to the greater total surface area for the pressure to act
upon, but for a given 5-foot (1.5 m) section of each dam, the 10 ft (3.0 m)
deep water will apply half the force of 20 ft (6.1 m) deep water). A person
will feel the same pressure whether his/her head is dunked a metre beneath the
surface of the water in a small pool or to the same depth in the middle of a
large lake. If four vases contain different amounts of water but are all filled
to equal depths, then a fish with its head dunked a few centimetres under the
surface will be acted on by water pressure that is the same in any of the
vases. If the fish swims a few centimetres deeper, the pressure on the fish
will increase with depth and be the same no matter which vase the fish is in.
If the fish swims to the bottom, the pressure will be greater, but it makes no
difference what vase it is in. All vases are filled to equal depths, so the
water pressure is the same at the bottom of each vase, regardless of its shape
or volume. If water pressure at the bottom of a vase were greater than water
pressure at the bottom of a neighboring vase, the greater pressure would force
water sideways and then up the narrower vase to a higher level until the
pressures at the bottom were equalized. Pressure is depth dependent, not volume
dependent, so there is a reason that water seeks its own level.
Restating this as energy equation, the energy per unit volume in an ideal,
incompressible liquid is constant throughout its vessel. At the surface,
gravitational potential energy is large but liquid pressure energy is low. At
the bottom of the vessel, all the gravitational potential energy is converted
to pressure energy. The sum of pressure energy and gravitational potential
energy per unit volume is constant throughout the volume of the fluid and the
two energy components change linearly with the depth.[14] Mathematically, it is
described by Bernoulli's_equation, where velocity head is zero and comparisons
per unit volume in the vessel are
           p &#x03B3;   + z =  c o n s t  .   {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{\gamma
      }}+z=\mathrm {const} .}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {p}{\gamma }}+z=\mathrm
      {const} .}]
Terms have the same meaning as in section_Fluid_pressure.
**** Direction of liquid pressure[edit] ****
An experimentally determined fact about liquid pressure is that it is exerted
equally in all directions.[15] If someone is submerged in water, no matter
which way that person tilts his/her head, the person will feel the same amount
of water pressure on his/her ears. Because a liquid can flow, this pressure
isn't only downward. Pressure is seen acting sideways when water spurts
sideways from a leak in the side of an upright can. Pressure also acts upward,
as demonstrated when someone tries to push a beach ball beneath the surface of
the water. The bottom of a boat is pushed upward by water pressure (buoyancy).
When a liquid presses against a surface, there is a net force that is
perpendicular to the surface. Although pressure doesn't have a specific
direction, force does. A submerged triangular block has water forced against
each point from many directions, but components of the force that are not
perpendicular to the surface cancel each other out, leaving only a net
perpendicular point.[15] This is why water spurting from a hole in a bucket
initially exits the bucket in a direction at right angles to the surface of the
bucket in which the hole is located. Then it curves downward due to gravity. If
there are three holes in a bucket (top, bottom, and middle), then the force
vectors perpendicular to the inner container surface will increase with
increasing depth â that is, a greater pressure at the bottom makes it so that
the bottom hole will shoot water out the farthest. The force exerted by a fluid
on a smooth surface is always at right angles to the surface. The speed of
liquid out of the hole is        2 g h      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt
{2gh}}}  [\scriptstyle \sqrt{2gh}], where h is the depth below the free
surface.[15] This is the same speed the water (or anything else) would have if
freely falling the same vertical distance h.
**** Kinematic pressure[edit] ****
         P = p  /   &#x03C1;  0     {\displaystyle P=p/\rho _{0}}  [P=p/\rho_0]
is the kinematic pressure, where     p   {\displaystyle p}  [p] is the pressure
and      &#x03C1;  0     {\displaystyle \rho _{0}}  [\rho _{0}] constant mass
density. The SI unit of P is m2/s2. Kinematic pressure is used in the same
manner as kinematic_viscosity     &#x03BD;   {\displaystyle \nu }  [\nu ] in
order to compute NavierâStokes_equation without explicitly showing the
density      &#x03C1;  0     {\displaystyle \rho _{0}}  [\rho _{0}].
  NavierâStokes equation with kinematic quantities
            &#x2202; u   &#x2202; t    + ( u &#x2207; ) u = &#x2212; &#x2207; P
      + &#x03BD;  &#x2207;  2   u .   {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}
      {\partial t}}+(u\nabla )u=-\nabla P+\nu \nabla ^{2}u.}  [{\displaystyle
      {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}+(u\nabla )u=-\nabla P+\nu \nabla ^
      {2}u.}]
