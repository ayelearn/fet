In fluid_dynamics, turbulence or turbulent flow is fluid motion characterized
by chaotic changes in pressure and flow_velocity. It is in contrast to a
laminar_flow, which occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no
disruption between those layers.[1]
Turbulence is commonly observed in everyday phenomena such as surf, fast
flowing rivers, billowing storm clouds, or smoke from a chimney, and most fluid
flows occurring in nature or created in engineering applications are turbulent.
[2][3]:2 Turbulence is caused by excessive kinetic energy in parts of a fluid
flow, which overcomes the damping effect of the fluid's viscosity. For this
reason turbulence is commonly realized in low viscosity fluids. In general
terms, in turbulent flow, unsteady vortices appear of many sizes which interact
with each other, consequently drag due to friction effects increases. This
increases the energy needed to pump fluid through a pipe. Turbulence can be
exploited, for example, by devices such as aerodynamic spoilers on aircraft
that "spoil" the laminar flow to increase drag and reduce lift.
The onset of turbulence can be predicted by the dimensionless Reynolds_number,
the ratio of kinetic energy to viscous damping in a fluid flow. However,
turbulence has long resisted detailed physical analysis, and the interactions
within turbulence create a very complex phenomenon. Richard_Feynman has
described turbulence as the most important unsolved problem in classical
physics.[4]

***** Examples of turbulence[edit] *****
Laminar and turbulent water flow over the hull of a submarine. As the relative
velocity of the water increases turbulence occurs.
Turbulence in the tip_vortex from an airplane wing
    * Smoke rising from a cigarette. For the first few centimeters, the smoke
      is laminar. The smoke plume becomes turbulent as its Reynolds_number
      increases with increases in flow velocity and characteristic lengthscale.
    * Flow over a golf_ball. (This can be best understood by considering the
      golf ball to be stationary, with air flowing over it.) If the golf ball
      were smooth, the boundary_layer flow over the front of the sphere would
      be laminar at typical conditions. However, the boundary layer would
      separate early, as the pressure gradient switched from favorable
      (pressure decreasing in the flow direction) to unfavorable (pressure
      increasing in the flow direction), creating a large region of low
      pressure behind the ball that creates high form_drag. To prevent this,
      the surface is dimpled to perturb the boundary layer and promote
      turbulence. This results in higher skin friction, but it moves the point
      of boundary layer separation further along, resulting in lower drag.
    * Clear-air_turbulence experienced during airplane flight, as well as poor
      astronomical_seeing (the blurring of images seen through the atmosphere).
    * Most of the terrestrial atmospheric_circulation.
    * The oceanic and atmospheric mixed_layers and intense oceanic currents.
    * The flow conditions in many industrial equipment (such as pipes, ducts,
      precipitators, gas scrubbers, dynamic_scraped_surface_heat_exchangers,
      etc.) and machines (for instance, internal_combustion_engines and gas
      turbines).
    * The external flow over all kinds of vehicles such as cars, airplanes,
      ships, and submarines.
    * The motions of matter in stellar atmospheres.
    * A jet exhausting from a nozzle into a quiescent fluid. As the flow
      emerges into this external fluid, shear layers originating at the lips of
      the nozzle are created. These layers separate the fast moving jet from
      the external fluid, and at a certain critical Reynolds_number they become
      unstable and break down to turbulence.
    * Biologically generated turbulence resulting from swimming animals affects
      ocean mixing.[5]

    * Snow_fences work by inducing turbulence in the wind, forcing it to drop
      much of its snow load near the fence.
    * Bridge supports (piers) in water. In the late summer and fall, when river
      flow is slow, water flows smoothly around the support legs. In the
      spring, when the flow is faster, a higher Reynolds number is associated
      with the flow. The flow may start off laminar but is quickly separated
      from the leg and becomes turbulent.
    * In many geophysical flows (rivers, atmospheric boundary layer), the flow
      turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events.
      A turbulent event is a series of turbulent fluctuations that contain more
      energy than the average flow turbulence.[6][7] The turbulent events are
      associated with coherent flow structures such as eddies and turbulent
      bursting, and they play a critical role in terms of sediment scour,
      accretion and transport in rivers as well as contaminant mixing and
      dispersion in rivers and estuaries, and in the atmosphere.
    * In the medical field of cardiology, a stethoscope is used to detect heart
      sounds and bruits, which are due to turbulent blood flow. In normal
      individuals, heart sounds are a product of turbulent flow as heart valves
      close. However, in some conditions turbulent flow can be audible due to
      other reasons, some of them pathological. For example, in advanced
      atherosclerosis, bruits (and therefore turbulent flow) can be heard in
      some vessels that have been narrowed by the disease process.
    * Recently, turbulence in porous media became a highly debated subject.[8]
***** Features[edit] *****

turbulent flows.
Turbulence is characterized by the following features:
  Irregularity 
      Turbulent flows are always highly irregular. For this reason, turbulence
      problems are normally treated statistically rather than
      deterministically. Turbulent flow is chaotic. However, not all chaotic
      flows are turbulent.
  Diffusivity 
      The readily available supply of energy in turbulent flows tends to
      accelerate the homogenization (mixing) of fluid mixtures. The
      characteristic which is responsible for the enhanced mixing and increased
      rates of mass, momentum and energy transports in a flow is called
      "diffusivity".
Turbulent diffusion is usually described by a turbulent diffusion_coefficient.
This turbulent diffusion coefficient is defined in a phenomenological sense, by
analogy with the molecular diffusivities, but it does not have a true physical
meaning, being dependent on the flow conditions, and not a property of the
fluid itself. In addition, the turbulent diffusivity concept assumes a
constitutive relation between a turbulent flux and the gradient of a mean
variable similar to the relation between flux and gradient that exists for
molecular transport. In the best case, this assumption is only an
approximation. Nevertheless, the turbulent diffusivity is the simplest approach
for quantitative analysis of turbulent flows, and many models have been
postulated to calculate it. For instance, in large bodies of water like oceans
this coefficient can be found using Richardson's four-third power law and is
governed by the random_walk principle. In rivers and large ocean currents, the
diffusion coefficient is given by variations of Elder's formula.
  Rotationality 
      Turbulent flows have non-zero vorticity and are characterized by a strong
      three-dimensional vortex generation mechanism known as vortex_stretching.
      In fluid dynamics, they are essentially vortices subjected to stretching
      associated with a corresponding increase of the component of vorticity in
      the stretching directionâdue to the conservation of angular momentum.
      On the other hand, vortex stretching is the core mechanism on which the
      turbulence energy cascade relies to establish the structure function.
      [clarification_needed] In general, the stretching mechanism implies
      thinning of the vortices in the direction perpendicular to the stretching
      direction due to volume conservation of fluid elements. As a result, the
      radial length scale of the vortices decreases and the larger flow
      structures break down into smaller structures. The process continues
      until the small scale structures are small enough that their kinetic
      energy can be transformed by the fluid's molecular viscosity into heat.
      This is why turbulence is always rotational and three dimensional. For
      example, atmospheric cyclones are rotational but their substantially two-
      dimensional shapes do not allow vortex generation and so are not
      turbulent. On the other hand, oceanic flows are dispersive but
      essentially non rotational and therefore are not turbulent.
  Dissipation 
      To sustain turbulent flow, a persistent source of energy supply is
      required because turbulence dissipates rapidly as the kinetic energy is
      converted into internal energy by viscous shear stress. Turbulence causes
      the formation of eddies of many different length scales. Most of the
      kinetic energy of the turbulent motion is contained in the large-scale
      structures. The energy "cascades" from these large-scale structures to
      smaller scale structures by an inertial and essentially inviscid
      mechanism. This process continues, creating smaller and smaller
      structures which produces a hierarchy of eddies. Eventually this process
      creates structures that are small enough that molecular diffusion becomes
      important and viscous dissipation of energy finally takes place. The
      scale at which this happens is the Kolmogorov_length_scale.
Via this energy_cascade, turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a
spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean_flow. The eddies
are loosely defined as coherent patterns of flow velocity, vorticity and
pressure. Turbulent flows may be viewed as made of an entire hierarchy of
eddies over a wide range of length scales and the hierarchy can be described by
the energy spectrum that measures the energy in flow velocity fluctuations for
each length scale (wavenumber). The scales in the energy cascade are generally
uncontrollable and highly non-symmetric. Nevertheless, based on these length
scales these eddies can be divided into three categories.
  Integral time scale
The integral time scale for a Lagrangian flow can be defined as:
         T =  (   1  &#x27E8;  u &#x2032;   u &#x2032;  &#x27E9;    )
      &#x222B;  0   &#x221E;   &#x27E8;  u &#x2032;   u &#x2032;  ( &#x03C4; )
      &#x27E9;  d &#x03C4;   {\displaystyle T=\left({\frac {1}{\langle
      u'u'\rangle }}\right)\int _{0}^{\infty }\langle u'u'(\tau )\rangle
      \,d\tau }  [{\displaystyle T=\left({\frac {1}{\langle u'u'\rangle
      }}\right)\int _{0}^{\infty }\langle u'u'(\tau )\rangle \,d\tau }]
where u′ is the velocity fluctuation, and     &#x03C4;   {\displaystyle \tau }
[\tau ] is the time lag between measurements.[9]
  Integral length scales
      Large eddies obtain energy from the mean flow and also from each other.
      Thus, these are the energy production eddies which contain most of the
      energy. They have the large flow velocity fluctuation and are low in
      frequency. Integral scales are highly anisotropic and are defined in
      terms of the normalized two-point flow velocity correlations. The maximum
      length of these scales is constrained by the characteristic length of the
      apparatus. For example, the largest integral length scale of pipe flow is
      equal to the pipe diameter. In the case of atmospheric turbulence, this
      length can reach up to the order of several hundreds kilometers.: The
      integral length scale can be defined as
               L =  (   1  &#x27E8;  u &#x2032;   u &#x2032;  &#x27E9;    )
            &#x222B;  0   &#x221E;   &#x27E8;  u &#x2032;   u &#x2032;  ( r )
            &#x27E9;  d r   {\displaystyle L=\left({\frac {1}{\langle
            u'u'\rangle }}\right)\int _{0}^{\infty }\langle u'u'(r)\rangle
            \,dr}  [{\displaystyle L=\left({\frac {1}{\langle u'u'\rangle
            }}\right)\int _{0}^{\infty }\langle u'u'(r)\rangle \,dr}]
      where r is the distance between two measurement locations, and u′ is the
      velocity fluctuation in that same direction.[9]
  Kolmogorov_length_scales 
      Smallest scales in the spectrum that form the viscous sub-layer range. In
      this range, the energy input from nonlinear interactions and the energy
      drain from viscous dissipation are in exact balance. The small scales
      have high frequency, causing turbulence to be locally isotropic and
      homogeneous.
  Taylor_microscales 
      The intermediate scales between the largest and the smallest scales which
      make the inertial subrange. Taylor microscales are not dissipative scale
      but pass down the energy from the largest to the smallest without
      dissipation. Some literatures do not consider Taylor microscales as a
      characteristic length scale and consider the energy cascade to contain
      only the largest and smallest scales; while the latter accommodate both
      the inertial subrange and the viscous sublayer. Nevertheless, Taylor
      microscales are often used in describing the term âturbulenceâ more
      conveniently as these Taylor microscales play a dominant role in energy
      and momentum transfer in the wavenumber space.
Although it is possible to find some particular solutions of the
NavierâStokes_equations governing fluid motion, all such solutions are
unstable to finite perturbations at large Reynolds numbers. Sensitive
dependence on the initial and boundary conditions makes fluid flow irregular
both in time and in space so that a statistical description is needed. The
Russian mathematician Andrey_Kolmogorov proposed the first statistical theory
of turbulence, based on the aforementioned notion of the energy cascade (an
idea originally introduced by Richardson) and the concept of self-similarity.
As a result, the Kolmogorov_microscales were named after him. It is now known
that the self-similarity is broken so the statistical description is presently
modified.[10]
A complete description of turbulence is one of the unsolved_problems_in
physics. According to an apocryphal story, Werner_Heisenberg was asked what he
would ask God, given the opportunity. His reply was: "When I meet God, I am
going to ask him two questions: Why relativity? And why turbulence? I really
believe he will have an answer for the first."[11] A similar witticism has been
attributed to Horace_Lamb (who had published a noted text book on
Hydrodynamics)âhis choice being quantum_electrodynamics (instead of
relativity) and turbulence. Lamb was quoted as saying in a speech to the
British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science, "I am an old man now, and
when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for
enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent
motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic."[12][13]
***** Onset of turbulence[edit] *****
The plume from this candle flame goes from laminar to turbulent. The Reynolds
number can be used to predict where this transition will take place
The onset of turbulence can be, to some extent, predicted by the Reynolds
number, which is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid
which is subject to relative internal movement due to different fluid
velocities, in what is known as a boundary_layer in the case of a bounding
surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the
introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a
flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a
factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity
of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more
kinetic energy is absorbed by a more viscous fluid. The Reynolds number
quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow
conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular
situation.[14]
This ability to predict the onset of turbulent flow is an important design tool
for equipment such as piping systems or aircraft wings, but the Reynolds number
is also used in scaling of fluid dynamics problems, and is used to determine
dynamic_similitude between two different cases of fluid flow, such as between a
model aircraft, and its full size version. Such scaling is not always linear
and the application of Reynolds numbers to both situations allows scaling
factors to be developed. A flow situation in which the kinetic_energy is
significantly absorbed due to the action of fluid molecular viscosity gives
rise to a laminar_flow regime. For this the dimensionless quantity the Reynolds
number (Re) is used as a guide.
With respect to laminar and turbulent flow regimes:
    * laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces are
      dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion;
    * turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers and is dominated by
      inertial forces, which tend to produce chaotic eddies, vortices and other
      flow instabilities.
The Reynolds number is defined as[15]
          R e  =    &#x03C1; v L  &#x03BC;    ,   {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} =
      {\frac {\rho vL}{\mu }}\,,}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho
      vL}{\mu }}\,,}]
where:
    * Ï is the density of the fluid (SI_units: kg/m3)
    * v is a characteristic velocity of the fluid with respect to the object
      (m/s)
    * L is a characteristic linear dimension (m)
    * Î¼ is the dynamic_viscosity of the fluid (PaÂ·s or NÂ·s/m2 or kg/(mÂ·s)).
While there is no theorem directly relating the non-dimensional Reynolds number
to turbulence, flows at Reynolds numbers larger than 5000 are typically (but
not necessarily) turbulent, while those at low Reynolds numbers usually remain
laminar. In Poiseuille_flow, for example, turbulence can first be sustained if
the Reynolds number is larger than a critical value of about 2040;[16]
moreover, the turbulence is generally interspersed with laminar flow until a
larger Reynolds number of about 4000.
The transition occurs if the size of the object is gradually increased, or the
viscosity of the fluid is decreased, or if the density of the fluid is
increased.
***** Heat and momentum transfer[edit] *****
When flow is turbulent, particles exhibit additional transverse motion which
enhances the rate of energy and momentum exchange between them thus increasing
the heat_transfer and the friction coefficient.
Assume for a two-dimensional turbulent flow that one was able to locate a
specific point in the fluid and measure the actual flow velocity v = (vx,vy) of
every particle that passed through that point at any given time. Then one would
find the actual flow velocity fluctuating about a mean value:
          v  x   =      v  x   &#x00AF;  &#x23DF;    mean value   +     v  x
      &#x2032;  &#x23DF;    fluctuation     and    v  y   =    v  y   &#x00AF;
      +  v  y  &#x2032;   ;   {\displaystyle v_{x}=\underbrace {\overline {v_
      {x}}} _{\text{mean value}}+\underbrace {v'_{x}} _{\text
      {fluctuation}}\quad {\text{and}}\quad v_{y}={\overline {v_{y}}}+v'_
      {y}\,;}  [{\displaystyle v_{x}=\underbrace {\overline {v_{x}}} _{\text
      {mean value}}+\underbrace {v'_{x}} _{\text{fluctuation}}\quad {\text
      {and}}\quad v_{y}={\overline {v_{y}}}+v'_{y}\,;}]
and similarly for temperature (T = T + Tâ²) and pressure (P = P + Pâ²), where
the primed quantities denote fluctuations superposed to the mean. This
decomposition of a flow variable into a mean value and a turbulent fluctuation
was originally proposed by Osborne_Reynolds in 1895, and is considered to be
the beginning of the systematic mathematical analysis of turbulent flow, as a
sub-field of fluid dynamics. While the mean values are taken as predictable
variables determined by dynamics laws, the turbulent fluctuations are regarded
as stochastic variables.
The heat flux and momentum transfer (represented by the shear stress Ï) in the
direction normal to the flow for a given time are
             q    =      v  y  &#x2032;  &#x03C1;  c  P    T &#x2032;
      &#x23DF;    experimental value   = &#x2212;  k  turb      &#x2202;   T
      &#x00AF;     &#x2202; y     ;     &#x03C4;    =     &#x2212; &#x03C1;
      v  y  &#x2032;   v  x  &#x2032;   &#x00AF;    &#x23DF;    experimental
      value   =  &#x03BC;  turb      &#x2202;    v  x   &#x00AF;     &#x2202; y
      ;       {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}q&=\underbrace {v'_{y}\rho c_
      {P}T'} _{\text{experimental value}}=-k_{\text{turb}}{\frac {\partial
      {\overline {T}}}{\partial y}}\,;\\\tau &=\underbrace {-\rho {\overline
      {v'_{y}v'_{x}}}} _{\text{experimental value}}=\mu _{\text{turb}}{\frac
      {\partial {\overline {v_{x}}}}{\partial y}}\,;\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}q&=\underbrace {v'_{y}\rho c_{P}T'} _
      {\text{experimental value}}=-k_{\text{turb}}{\frac {\partial {\overline

      {x}}}} _{\text{experimental value}}=\mu _{\text{turb}}{\frac {\partial

where cP is the heat_capacity at constant pressure, Ï is the density of the
fluid, Î¼turb is the coefficient of turbulent viscosity and kturb is the
turbulent thermal_conductivity.[3]
***** Kolmogorov's theory of 1941[edit] *****
Richardson's notion of turbulence was that a turbulent flow is composed by
"eddies" of different sizes. The sizes define a characteristic length scale for
the eddies, which are also characterized by flow velocity scales and time
scales (turnover time) dependent on the length scale. The large eddies are
unstable and eventually break up originating smaller eddies, and the kinetic
energy of the initial large eddy is divided into the smaller eddies that
stemmed from it. These smaller eddies undergo the same process, giving rise to
even smaller eddies which inherit the energy of their predecessor eddy, and so
on. In this way, the energy is passed down from the large scales of the motion
to smaller scales until reaching a sufficiently small length scale such that
the viscosity of the fluid can effectively dissipate the kinetic energy into
internal energy.
In his original theory of 1941, Kolmogorov postulated that for very high
Reynolds_numbers, the small scale turbulent motions are statistically isotropic
(i.e. no preferential spatial direction could be discerned). In general, the
large scales of a flow are not isotropic, since they are determined by the
particular geometrical features of the boundaries (the size characterizing the
large scales will be denoted as L). Kolmogorov's idea was that in the
Richardson's energy cascade this geometrical and directional information is
lost, while the scale is reduced, so that the statistics of the small scales
has a universal character: they are the same for all turbulent flows when the
Reynolds number is sufficiently high.
Thus, Kolmogorov introduced a second hypothesis: for very high Reynolds numbers
the statistics of small scales are universally and uniquely determined by the
kinematic_viscosity Î½ and the rate of energy dissipation Îµ. With only these
two parameters, the unique length that can be formed by dimensional analysis is
         &#x03B7; =   (    &#x03BD;  3   &#x03B5;   )    1 4     .
      {\displaystyle \eta =\left({\frac {\nu ^{3}}{\varepsilon }}\right)^{\frac
      {1}{4}}\,.}  [{\displaystyle \eta =\left({\frac {\nu ^{3}}{\varepsilon
      }}\right)^{\frac {1}{4}}\,.}]
This is today known as the Kolmogorov length scale (see Kolmogorov
microscales).
A turbulent flow is characterized by a hierarchy of scales through which the
energy cascade takes place. Dissipation of kinetic energy takes place at scales
of the order of Kolmogorov length Î·, while the input of energy into the
cascade comes from the decay of the large scales, of order L. These two scales
at the extremes of the cascade can differ by several orders of magnitude at
high Reynolds numbers. In between there is a range of scales (each one with its
own characteristic length r) that has formed at the expense of the energy of
the large ones. These scales are very large compared with the Kolmogorov
length, but still very small compared with the large scale of the flow (i.e. Î·
âª r âª L). Since eddies in this range are much larger than the dissipative
eddies that exist at Kolmogorov scales, kinetic energy is essentially not
dissipated in this range, and it is merely transferred to smaller scales until
viscous effects become important as the order of the Kolmogorov scale is
approached. Within this range inertial effects are still much larger than
viscous effects, and it is possible to assume that viscosity does not play a
role in their internal dynamics (for this reason this range is called "inertial
range").
Hence, a third hypothesis of Kolmogorov was that at very high Reynolds number
the statistics of scales in the range Î· âª r âª L are universally and
uniquely determined by the scale r and the rate of energy dissipation Îµ.
The way in which the kinetic energy is distributed over the multiplicity of
scales is a fundamental characterization of a turbulent flow. For homogeneous
turbulence (i.e., statistically invariant under translations of the reference
frame) this is usually done by means of the energy spectrum function E(k),
where k is the modulus of the wavevector corresponding to some harmonics in a
Fourier representation of the flow velocity field u(x):
          u  (  x  ) =  &#x222D;    R   3         u  &#x005E;    (  k  )  e  i
      k &#x22C5; x       d   3    k   ,   {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf
      {x} )=\iiint _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}{\hat {\mathbf {u} }}(\mathbf {k} )e^
      {i\mathbf {k\cdot x} }\,\mathrm {d} ^{3}\mathbf {k} \,,}  [{\displaystyle
      \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} )=\iiint _{\mathbb {R} ^{3}}{\hat {\mathbf {u}
      }}(\mathbf {k} )e^{i\mathbf {k\cdot x} }\,\mathrm {d} ^{3}\mathbf {k}
      \,,}]
where Ã»(k) is the Fourier transform of the flow velocity field. Thus, E(k) dk
represents the contribution to the kinetic energy from all the Fourier modes
with k < |k| < k + dk, and therefore,
            1 2     &#x27E8;   u  i    u  i    &#x27E9;  =  &#x222B;  0
      &#x221E;   E ( k )   d  k  ,   {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}\left\langle
      u_{i}u_{i}\right\rangle =\int _{0}^{\infty }E(k)\,\mathrm {d} k\,,}  [
      {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}\left\langle u_{i}u_{i}\right\rangle =\int
      _{0}^{\infty }E(k)\,\mathrm {d} k\,,}]
where 1/2â¨uiuiâ© is the mean turbulent kinetic energy of the flow. The
wavenumber k corresponding to length scale r is k = 2Ï/r. Therefore, by
dimensional analysis, the only possible form for the energy spectrum function
according with the third Kolmogorov's hypothesis is
         E ( k ) = C  &#x03B5;   2 3     k  &#x2212;   5 3      ,
      {\displaystyle E(k)=C\varepsilon ^{\frac {2}{3}}k^{-{\frac {5}{3}}}\,,}
      [{\displaystyle E(k)=C\varepsilon ^{\frac {2}{3}}k^{-{\frac {5}{3}}}\,,}]
where C would be a universal constant. This is one of the most famous results
of Kolmogorov 1941 theory, and considerable experimental evidence has
accumulated that supports it.[17]
In spite of this success, Kolmogorov theory is at present under revision. This
theory implicitly assumes that the turbulence is statistically self-similar at
different scales. This essentially means that the statistics are scale-
invariant in the inertial range. A usual way of studying turbulent flow
velocity fields is by means of flow velocity increments:
         &#x03B4;  u  ( r ) =  u  (  x  +  r  ) &#x2212;  u  (  x  )  ;
      {\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {u} (r)=\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} +\mathbf
      {r} )-\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} )\,;}  [{\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {u}
      (r)=\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} +\mathbf {r} )-\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x}
      )\,;}]
that is, the difference in flow velocity between points separated by a vector r
(since the turbulence is assumed isotropic, the flow velocity increment depends
only on the modulus of r). Flow velocity increments are useful because they
emphasize the effects of scales of the order of the separation r when
statistics are computed. The statistical scale-invariance implies that the
scaling of flow velocity increments should occur with a unique scaling exponent
Î², so that when r is scaled by a factor Î»,
         &#x03B4;  u  ( &#x03BB; r )   {\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {u}
      (\lambda r)}  [\delta \mathbf{u}(\lambda r)]
should have the same statistical distribution as
          &#x03BB;  &#x03B2;   &#x03B4;  u  ( r )  ,   {\displaystyle \lambda ^
      {\beta }\delta \mathbf {u} (r)\,,}  [{\displaystyle \lambda ^{\beta
      }\delta \mathbf {u} (r)\,,}]
with Î² independent of the scale r. From this fact, and other results of
Kolmogorov 1941 theory, it follows that the statistical moments of the flow
velocity increments (known as structure functions in turbulence) should scale
as
           &#x27E8;     (   &#x03B4;  u  ( r )    )    n     &#x27E9;   =  C  n
      ( &#x03B5; r  )   n 3     ,   {\displaystyle {\Big \langle }{\big
      (}\delta \mathbf {u} (r){\big )}^{n}{\Big \rangle }=C_{n}(\varepsilon r)^
      {\frac {n}{3}}\,,}  [{\displaystyle {\Big \langle }{\big (}\delta \mathbf
      {u} (r){\big )}^{n}{\Big \rangle }=C_{n}(\varepsilon r)^{\frac {n}
      {3}}\,,}]
where the brackets denote the statistical average, and the Cn would be
universal constants.
There is considerable evidence that turbulent flows deviate from this behavior.
The scaling exponents deviate from the n/3 value predicted by the theory,
becoming a non-linear function of the order n of the structure function. The
universality of the constants have also been questioned. For low orders the
discrepancy with the Kolmogorov n/3 value is very small, which explain the
success of Kolmogorov theory in regards to low order statistical moments. In
particular, it can be shown that when the energy spectrum follows a power law
         E ( k ) &#x221D;  k  &#x2212; p    ,   {\displaystyle E(k)\propto k^{-
      p}\,,}  [{\displaystyle E(k)\propto k^{-p}\,,}]
with 1 < p < 3, the second order structure function has also a power law, with
the form
           &#x27E8;     (   &#x03B4;  u  ( r )    )    2     &#x27E9;
      &#x221D;  r  p &#x2212; 1    ,   {\displaystyle {\Big \langle }{\big
      (}\delta \mathbf {u} (r){\big )}^{2}{\Big \rangle }\propto r^{p-1}\,,}  [
      {\displaystyle {\Big \langle }{\big (}\delta \mathbf {u} (r){\big )}^{2}
      {\Big \rangle }\propto r^{p-1}\,,}]
Since the experimental values obtained for the second order structure function
only deviate slightly from the 2/3 value predicted by Kolmogorov theory, the
value for p is very near to 5/3 (differences are about 2%[18]). Thus the
"Kolmogorov â5/3 spectrum" is generally observed in turbulence. However, for
high order structure functions the difference with the Kolmogorov scaling is
significant, and the breakdown of the statistical self-similarity is clear.
This behavior, and the lack of universality of the Cn constants, are related
with the phenomenon of intermittency in turbulence. This is an important area
of research in this field, and a major goal of the modern theory of turbulence
is to understand what is really universal in the inertial range.
