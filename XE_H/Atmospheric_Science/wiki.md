Atmospheric science is the study of the Earth's_atmosphere, its processes, the
effects other systems have on the atmosphere, and the effects of the atmosphere
on these other systems. Meteorology includes atmospheric_chemistry and
atmospheric_physics with a major focus on weather_forecasting. Climatology is
the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average
climates and their change over time, due to both natural and anthropogenic
climate_variability. Aeronomy is the study of the upper layers of the
atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. Atmospheric
science has been extended to the field of planetary_science and the study of
the atmospheres of the planets and natural_satellites of the solar_system.
Experimental instruments used in atmospheric science include satellites,
rocketsondes, radiosondes, weather_balloons, and lasers.
The term aerology (from Greek á¼Î®Ï, aÄr, "air"; and -Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±, -logia) is
sometimes used as an alternative term for the study of Earth's atmosphere;
[citation_needed] in other definitions, aerology is restricted to the free
atmosphere, the region above the planetary_boundary_layer.[1]
Early pioneers in the field include LÃ©on_Teisserenc_de_Bort and Richard
Assmann.[2]

***** Atmospheric chemistry[edit] *****
[Atmosphere_composition_diagram-en.svg]
Main article: Atmospheric_chemistry
Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry
of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets is studied. It is a
multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry,
physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology
and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of
study such as climatology.
The composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is of importance for several
reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and
living organisms. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere has been changed by
human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and
ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric
chemistry include acid rain, photochemical smog and global warming. Atmospheric
chemistry seeks to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a
theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and
the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.
***** Atmospheric dynamics[edit] *****
See also: Synoptic_scale_meteorology
Atmospheric dynamics involves the study of observations and theory dealing with
all motion systems of meteorological importance. Common topics studied include
diverse phenomena such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, gravity_waves, tropical
cyclones, extratropical_cyclones, jet_streams, and global-scale circulations.
The goal of dynamical studies is to explain the observed circulations on the
basis of fundamental principles from physics. The objectives of such studies
incorporate improving weather_forecasting, developing methods for predicting
seasonal and interannual climate fluctuations, and understanding the
implications of human-induced perturbations (e.g., increased carbon dioxide
concentrations or depletion of the ozone layer) on the global climate.[3]
***** Atmospheric physics[edit] *****
Main article: Atmospheric_physics
Atmospheric physics is the application of physics to the study of the
atmosphere. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model Earth's atmosphere and the
atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations, chemical models,
radiation balancing, and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere and
underlying oceans. In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists
employ elements of scattering theory, wave_propagation models, cloud_physics,
statistical_mechanics and spatial statistics, each of which incorporate high
levels of mathematics and physics. Atmospheric physics has close links to
meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of
instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they
provide, including remote sensing instruments.
In the United Kingdom, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the
Meteorological Office. Divisions of the U.S. National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) oversee research projects and weather modeling involving
atmospheric physics. The U.S._National_Astronomy_and_Ionosphere_Center also
carries out studies of the high atmosphere.
The Earth's_magnetic_field and the solar_wind interact with the atmosphere,
creating the ionosphere, Van_Allen_radiation_belts, telluric_currents, and
radiant_energy.
***** Climatology[edit] *****
Regional impacts of warm ENSO episodes (El NiÃ±o).
Main article: Climatology
In contrast to meteorology, which studies short term weather systems lasting up
to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems.
It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well
as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric
conditions. Climatologists, those who practice climatology, study both the
nature of climates â local, regional or global â and the natural or human-
induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past
and can help predict future climate_change.
Phenomena of climatological interest include the atmospheric_boundary_layer,
circulation_patterns, heat_transfer (radiative, convective and latent),
interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans and land surface
(particularly vegetation, land_use and topography), and the chemical and
physical composition of the atmosphere. Related disciplines include
astrophysics, atmospheric_physics, chemistry, ecology, physical_geography,
geology, geophysics, glaciology, hydrology, oceanography, and volcanology.
***** Atmospheres on other celestial bodies[edit] *****
Earth's atmosphere
All of the Solar System's planets have atmospheres. This is because their
gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface. Larger
gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen
and helium close by, while the smaller planets lose these gases into space.[4]
The composition of the Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets
because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have
introduced free molecular oxygen.[5] Much of Mercury's atmosphere has been
blasted away by the solar_wind.[6] The only moon that has retained a dense
atmosphere is Titan. There is a thin atmosphere on Triton, and a trace of an
atmosphere on the Moon.
Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying degrees of energy received
from either the Sun or their interiors, leading to the formation of dynamic
weather_systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust_storms (on
Mars), an Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the Great_Red_Spot), and
holes_in_the_atmosphere (on Neptune).[7] At least one extrasolar planet, HD
189733_b, has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the
Great Red Spot but twice as large.[8]
Hot Jupiters have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to
stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets.[9][10] These planets may have
vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides which produce
supersonic winds,[11] although the day and night sides of HD 189733b appear to
have very similar temperatures, indicating that planet's atmosphere effectively
redistributes the star's energy around the planet.[8]
