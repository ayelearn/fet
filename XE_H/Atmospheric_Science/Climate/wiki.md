On Earth, interactions between the five parts of the climate_system produce our
daily weather and long-term averages of weather are called "climate".[1][2]
Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are
temperature, humidity, atmospheric_pressure, wind, and precipitation. The
climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as
well as nearby water_bodies and their currents.
In a broader sense, the "climate" of a region is the general state of the
climate_system at that location.
Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of
different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most
commonly used classification scheme was the KÃ¶ppen_climate_classification. The
Thornthwaite system,[3] in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration
along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying
biological diversity and how climate_change affects it. The Bergeron and
Spatial_Synoptic_Classification_systems focus on the origin of air masses that
define the climate of a region.
Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of
climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred
from proxy_variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found
in lake_beds and ice_cores, and biotic evidence such as tree_rings and coral.
Climate_models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates.
Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of
factors; recent warming is discussed in global_warming. Global warming results
in redistributions. For example, "a 3Â°C change in mean annual temperature
corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300â400 km in latitude
(in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected
to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to
shifting climate zones".[4][5]

***** Definition[edit] *****
Generalistic map of global temperature in simple warm and cold differential.
Same but in threefold levels of temperature differential.
Climate (from Ancient_Greek klima, meaning inclination) is commonly defined as
the weather averaged over a long period.[6] The standard averaging period is
30 years,[7] but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate
also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-
to-day or year-to-year variations. The Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate
Change (IPCC) 2001 glossary definition is as follows:
     Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average
     weather," or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms
     of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period
     ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical
     period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological
     Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables
     such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider
     sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the
     climate system.[8]
The World_Meteorological_Organization (WMO) describes climate "normals" as
"reference points used by climatologists to compare current climatological
trends to that of the past or what is considered 'normal'. A Normal is defined
as the arithmetic average of a climate element (e.g. temperature) over a 30-
year period. A 30 year period is used, as it is long enough to filter out any
interannual variation or anomalies, but also short enough to be able to show
longer climatic trends."[9] The WMO originated from the International
Meteorological_Organization which set up a technical commission for climatology
in 1929. At its 1934 Wiesbaden meeting the technical commission designated the
thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for
climatological standard normals. In 1982 the WMO agreed to update climate
normals, and these were subsequently completed on the basis of climate data
from 1 January 1961 to 31 December 1990.[10]
The difference between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the
popular phrase "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."[11] Over
historical time spans there are a number of nearly constant variables that
determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water,
and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of
millions of years due to processes such as plate_tectonics. Other climate
determinants are more dynamic: the thermohaline_circulation of the ocean leads
to a 5 Â°C (9 Â°F) warming of the northern Atlantic_Ocean compared to other
ocean basins.[12] Other ocean_currents redistribute heat between land and water
on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation coverage affects
solar heat absorption,[13] water retention, and rainfall on a regional level.
Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse_gases determines the
amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to global_warming or
global_cooling. The variables which determine climate are numerous and the
interactions complex, but there is general agreement that the broad outlines
are understood, at least insofar as the determinants of historical climate
change are concerned.[14]
***** Climate classification[edit] *****
[Map_of_world_dividing_climate_zones,_largely_influenced_by_latitude._The

Moderate,_Continental_and_Polar._There_are_subzones_within_these_zones.]
                   Worldwide KÃ¶ppen climate classifications
There are several ways to classify_climates into similar regimes. Originally,
climes were defined in Ancient_Greece to describe the weather depending upon a
location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly
divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric
methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic
classification include methods based on the relative_frequency of different air
mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of
empiric classifications include climate_zones defined by plant_hardiness,[15]
evapotranspiration,[16] or more generally the KÃ¶ppen_climate_classification
which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain
biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification_schemes is that they
produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the
gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.
**** Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic[edit] ****
The simplest classification is that involving air_masses. The Bergeron
classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification.[17]
Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its
moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for
maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal
characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic
or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air
formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is
used to designate the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder
than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the
ground below it, it is labeled w.[18] While air mass identification was
originally used in weather_forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began
to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.[19]
Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the Spatial_Synoptic
Classification_system (SSC). There are six categories within the SSC scheme:
Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime
superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar
to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and
maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime
monsoon, or maritime equatorial).[20]

Main article: KÃ¶ppen_climate_classification
The KÃ¶ppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and
precipitation. The most commonly used form of the KÃ¶ppen classification has
five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A) tropical, B)
dry, C) mild mid-latitude, D) cold mid-latitude, and E) polar. The five primary
classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as
rainforest, monsoon, tropical_savanna, humid_subtropical, humid_continental,
oceanic_climate, Mediterranean_climate, desert, steppe, subarctic_climate,
tundra, and polar_ice_cap.
Rainforests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting
minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 millimetres (69 in) and 2,000
millimetres (79 in). Mean monthly temperatures exceed 18 Â°C (64 Â°F) during
all months of the year.[21]
A monsoon is a seasonal prevailing wind which lasts for several months,
ushering in a region's rainy season.[22] Regions within North_America, South
America, Sub-Saharan_Africa, Australia and East_Asia are monsoon regimes.[23]

collected between July 2002 and April 2015.[24]
A tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semiarid to semi-humid
climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes, with average
temperatures remain at or above 18 Â°C (64 Â°F) year round and rainfall between
750 millimetres (30 in) and 1,270 millimetres (50 in) a year. They are
widespread on Africa, and are found in India, the northern parts of South
America, Malaysia, and Australia.[25]

The humid subtropical climate zone where winter rainfall (and sometimes
snowfall) is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west
to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional
tropical_cyclones.[28] Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side of
continents, roughly between latitudes 20Â° and 40Â° degrees away from the
equator.[29]
                     Humid_continental_climate, worldwide
A humid continental climate is marked by variable weather patterns and a large
seasonal temperature variance. Places with more than three months of average
daily temperatures above 10 Â°C (50 Â°F) and a coldest month temperature below
â3 Â°C (27 Â°F) and which do not meet the criteria for an arid or semiarid
climate, are classified as continental.[30]
An oceanic climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle
latitudes of all the world's continents, and in southeastern Australia, and is
accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.[31]
The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the
Mediterranean_Basin, parts of western North_America, parts of Western and South
Australia, in southwestern South_Africa and in parts of central Chile. The
climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.[32]
A steppe is a dry grassland with an annual temperature range in the summer of
up to 40 Â°C (104 Â°F) and during the winter down to â40 Â°C (â40 Â°F).[33]
A subarctic climate has little precipitation,[34] and monthly temperatures
which are above 10 Â°C (50 Â°F) for one to three months of the year, with
permafrost in large parts of the area due to the cold winters. Winters within
subarctic climates usually include up to six months of temperatures averaging
below 0 Â°C (32 Â°F).[35]
                             Map of arctic tundra
Tundra occurs in the far Northern_Hemisphere, north of the taiga belt,
including vast areas of northern Russia and Canada.[36]
A polar ice cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region of a planet or
moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions
receive less energy as solar_radiation from the sun than equatorial regions,
resulting in lower surface_temperatures.[37]
A desert is a landscape form or region that receives very little precipitation.
Deserts usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range, with high
or low, depending on location daytime temperatures (in summer up to 45 Â°C or
113 Â°F), and low nighttime temperatures (in winter down to 0 Â°C or 32 Â°F)
due to extremely low humidity. Many deserts are formed by rain_shadows, as
mountains block the path of moisture and precipitation to the desert.[38]
**** Thornthwaite[edit] ****
See also: Microthermal, Mesothermal, and Megathermal
Precipitation by month
Devised by the American climatologist and geographer C._W._Thornthwaite, this
climate classification method monitors the soil water budget using
evapotranspiration.[39] It monitors the portion of total precipitation used to
nourish vegetation over a certain area.[40] It uses indices such as a humidity
index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon
its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type.[41] The
lower the value of the index in any given area, the drier the area is.
The moisture classification includes climatic classes with descriptors such as
hyperhumid, humid, subhumid, subarid, semi-arid (values of â20 to â40), and
arid (values below â40).[42] Humid regions experience more precipitation than
evaporation each year, while arid regions experience greater evaporation than
precipitation on an annual basis. A total of 33 percent of the Earth's landmass
is considered either arid or semi-arid, including southwest North America,
southwest South America, most of northern and a small part of southern Africa,
southwest and portions of eastern Asia, as well as much of Australia.[43]
Studies suggest that precipitation effectiveness (PE) within the Thornthwaite
moisture index is overestimated in the summer and underestimated in the winter.
[44] This index can be effectively used to determine the number of herbivore
and mammal species numbers within a given area.[45] The index is also used in
studies of climate change.[44]
Thermal classifications within the Thornthwaite scheme include microthermal,
mesothermal, and megathermal regimes. A microthermal climate is one of low
annual mean temperatures, generally between 0 Â°C (32 Â°F) and 14 Â°C (57 Â°F)
which experiences short summers and has a potential evaporation between 14
centimetres (5.5 in) and 43 centimetres (17 in).[46] A mesothermal climate
lacks persistent heat or persistent cold, with potential evaporation between 57
centimetres (22 in) and 114 centimetres (45 in).[47] A megathermal climate is
one with persistent high temperatures and abundant rainfall, with potential
annual evaporation in excess of 114 centimetres (45 in).[48]

measurements
Details of the modern climate record are known through the taking of
measurements from such weather instruments as thermometers, barometers, and
anemometers during the past few centuries. The instruments used to study
weather over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate
environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must be
considered when studying the climate of centuries past.[49]
**** Paleoclimatology[edit] ****
Main article: Paleoclimatology
Paleoclimatology is the study of past climate over a great period of the
Earth's history. It uses evidence from ice sheets, tree rings, sediments,
coral, and rocks to determine the past state of the climate. It demonstrates
periods of stability and periods of change and can indicate whether changes
follow patterns such as regular cycles.[50]

Climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time. It
reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over
time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be
caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in
sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.[51][52]
    2015 â Warmest_Global_Year on Record (since 1880) â Colors indicate
            temperature anomalies (NASA/NOAA; 20 January 2016).[53]
In recent usage, especially in the context of environmental_policy, the term
"climate change" often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the
rise in average surface temperature known as global_warming. In some cases, the
term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the United
Nations Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses
"climate variability" for non-human caused variations.[54]
Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major
ice_ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than
normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice
during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the
Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature.
Increases in greenhouse_gases, such as by volcanic_activity, can increase the
global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice
age periods include the positions of the continents, variations in the Earth's
orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.[55]
**** Climate models[edit] ****
See also: Climate_model and Climatology
Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the
atmosphere,[56] oceans, land surface and ice. They are used for a variety of
purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to
projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly
balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic
radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared)
electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in
the average temperature of the earth.
The most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been
their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere, primarily carbon_dioxide (see greenhouse_gas). These models predict
an upward trend in the global_mean_surface_temperature, with the most rapid
increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere.
Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
    * Simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single
      point and averages outgoing energy
    * this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or
      horizontally
    * finally, (coupled) atmosphereâoceanâsea_ice global_climate_models
      discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and
      radiant exchange.[57]
Climate forecasting is used by some scientists to predict climate change. In
1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for
Climate and Society at Columbia University began generating seasonal climate
forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite
of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach
that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating
interannual climate variability.[58]
