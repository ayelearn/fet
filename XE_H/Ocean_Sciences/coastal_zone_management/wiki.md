Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) or Integrated coastal management
(ICM) is a process for the management of the coast using an integrated
approach, regarding all aspects of the coastal zone, including geographical and
political boundaries, in an attempt to achieve sustainability
This concept was born in 1992 during the Earth_Summit of Rio_de_Janeiro. The
specifics regarding ICZM is set out in the proceedings of the summit within
Agenda_21, Chapter 17.
The European_Commission defines the ICZM as follows:-
     ICZM is a dynamic, multidisciplinary and iterative process to promote
     sustainable management of coastal zones. It covers the full cycle of
     information collection, planning (in its broadest sense), decision
     making, management and monitoring of implementation. ICZM uses the
     informed participation and cooperation of all stakeholders to assess
     the societal goals in a given coastal area, and to take actions
     towards meeting these objectives. ICZM seeks, over the long-term, to
     balance environmental, economic, social, cultural and recreational
     objectives, all within the limits set by natural dynamics.
     'Integrated' in ICZM refers to the integration of objectives and also
     to the integration of the many instruments needed to meet these
     objectives. It means integration of all relevant policy areas,
     sectors, and levels of administration. It means integration of the
     terrestrial and marine components of the target territory, in both
     time and space.
To further understand the idea of ICZM several aspects can be defined and
further explained. The coastal zone, the concept of sustainability and the term
integration all within a coastal management context can be individually
defined, while the expectations and framework of ICZM can be further explained.
This entry uses the example of the New Zealand national framework to illustrate
ICZM.

***** Defining the Coastal Zone[edit] *****
Defining the Coastal zone is of particular importance to the idea of ICZM. But
the fuzziness of borders due to the dynamic nature of the coast makes it
difficult to clearly define. Most simply the coast can be thought of as an area
of interaction between the land and the ocean. Ketchum (1972)[1] defined the
area as:
     The band of dry land and adjacent ocean space (water and submerged
     land) in which terrestrial processes and land uses directly affect
     oceanic processes and uses, and vice versa.
Issues arise with the diversity of features present on the coast and the
spatial scales of the interacting systems. Coasts being dynamic in nature are
influenced differently all around the world. Influences such as river systems,
may reach far inland increasing the complexity and scale of the zone. These
issues make it difficult to clearly identify hinterlands and subscribe any
subsequent management.
Whilst acknowledging a physical coastal zone, the inclusion of ecosystems,
resources and human activity within the zone is important. It is the human
activities that warrant management. These activities are responsible for
disrupting the natural coastal systems. To add to the complexity of this zone,
administrative boundaries use arbitrary lines that dissect the zone, often
leading to fragmented management. This sectored approach focuses on specific
activities such as land use and fisheries, often leading to adverse effects in
another sector.
***** The importance of the Coastal Zone and the need for management[edit]
*****
The dynamic processes that occur within the coastal zones produce diverse and
productive ecosystems which have been of great importance historically for
human populations.[2] Coastal margins equate to only 8% of the worlds surface
area but provide 25% of global productivity. Stress on this environment comes
with approximately 70% of the worldâs population being within a dayâs walk
of the coast.[3] Two-thirds of the worldâs cities occur on the coast.[4]
Valuable resources such as fish and minerals are considered to be common
property and are in high demand for coastal dwellers for subsistence use,
recreation and economic development.[5] Through the perception of common
property, these resources have been subjected to intensive and specific
exploitation. For example; 90% of the worldâs fish harvest comes from within
national exclusive_economic_zones, most of which are within the sight of shore.
[3] This type of practice has led to a problem that has cumulative effects. The
addition of other activities adds to the strain placed on this environment. As
a whole, human activity in the coastal zone generally degrades the systems by
taking unsustainable quantities of resources. The effects are further
exacerbated with the input of pollutant wastes. This provides the need for
management. Due to the complex nature of human activity in this zone a holistic
approach is required to obtain a sustainable outcome.
***** The concept of sustainability[edit] *****
The concept behind the idea of ICZM is sustainability. For ICZM to succeed, it
must be sustainable. Sustainability entails a continuous process of decision
making, so there is never an end-state just a readjustment of the equilibrium
between development and the protection of the environment.[6] The concept of
Sustainability or sustainable development came to fruition in the 1987 report
of the World Commission on Environment and Development, Our_Common_Future. It
stated sustainable development is âto meet the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needsâ.[7]
Highlighted are three main standpoints which summarise the idea of Sustainable
development, they are:
    * Economic development to improve the quality of life of people
    * Environmentally appropriate development
    * Equitable development[6]
To simplify these points, sustainability should acknowledge the right of humans
to live a life that is healthy and productive. It should allow for equal
distribution of benefits to all people and in doing so protect the environment
through appropriate use.[6]
Sustainability is by no means a set of prescriptive actions, more accurately it
is a way of thinking. Adapting this way of thinking paves the way for a longer-
term view with a more holistic approach, something successful ICZM can achieve.
[8]
***** Expectations of ICZM[edit] *****
As previously stated, for ICZM to be successful it must adhere to the
principles that define sustainability and act upon them in ways that are
integrated. An optimal balance between environmental protection and the
development of economic and social sectors is paramount.[9] As part of the
holistic approach ICZM applies, many aspects within a coastal zone are expected
to be considered and accounted for. These include but are not limited to: the
spatial, functional, legal, policy, knowledge, and participation dimensions.
[10] Below are four identified goals of ICZM:
    * Maintaining the functional integrity of the coastal resource systems;
    * Reducing resource-use conflicts;
    * Maintaining the health of the environment;
    * Facilitating the progress of multisectoral development[11]
Failure to include these aspects and goals would lead to a form of
unsustainable management, undermining the paradigms explicit to ICZM.
***** Defining Integration[edit] *****
The term âintegrationâ can be adopted for many different purposes, it is
therefore quite important to define the term in the context of the management
of the coastal zone to appreciate the intentions of ICZM. Integration within
ICZM occurs in and between many different levels, 5 types of integration that
occur within ICZM,[6] are explained below;
Integration among sectors: Within the coastal environment there are many
sectors that operate. These human activities are largely economic activities
such as tourism, fisheries, and port companies. A sense of co-operation between
sectors is the main requirement for sector integration within ICZM. This comes
from the realisation of a common goal focused around sustainability and the
appreciation of one another within the area.
Integration between land and water elements of the coastal zone: This is the
realisation of the physical environment being a whole. The coastal environment
is a dynamic relationship between many processes all of which are
interdependent. The link must be made between imposing a change on one system
or feature and its inevitable âflow onâ effects.
Integration among levels of government: Between levels of governance,
consistency and co-operation is needed throughout planning and policy making.
ICZM is most effective where initiatives have common purpose at local,
regional, and national levels. Common goals and actions increase efficiency and
mitigate confusion.
Integration between nations: This sees ICZM as an important tool on a global
scale. If goals and beliefs are common on a supranational scale, large scale
problems could be mitigated or avoided.
Integration among disciplines: Throughout ICZM, knowledge should be accepted
from all disciplines. All means of scientific, cultural, traditional, political
and local expertise need to be accounted for. By including all these elements a
truly holistic approach towards management can be achieved.
The term integration in a coastal management context has many horizontal and
vertical aspects, which reflects the complexity of the task and it proves a
challenge to implement.
***** ICZM Framework[edit] *****
Management must embrace a holistic viewpoint of the functions that makeup the
complex and dynamic nature of interactions in the coastal environment.[12]
Management framework must be applied to a defined geographical limit (often
complicated) and should operate with a high level of integration.[11] Due to
the diverse nature of the worldâs coastline and coastal environments, it is
not possible to create a framework that is âone-size-fits-all.â Different
activities, interests and issues also complicate matters. So management will
always be unique to countries, regions and ultimately on a local scale.
A common thought process and decision making framework however, can be fairly
uniform as a part of ICZM around the world. To achieve the principles set out
in sustainable types of management a step by step process can be adhered to.
Firstly, issues and problems need to be identified and assessments of these
need to be quantified. This first step will include integration between
government, sectoral entities and local residents. The assessments also have to
be broad in their application. Once the issues and problems have been
identified and weighted, an effective management plan can be made. The plan
will be specific to the area in question. Thirdly, the adoption of the plan can
be carried out. They can be legally binding statutory plans, strategies or
objectives which are generally quite powerful or they can be non-statutory
processes and can act as a guide for future development.[8] This duality is
largely beneficial as the future can be taken into account, but still provide
for a firm stance based in the present.[2] The fourth step is implementation,
this active phase includes; law enforcement, education, development etc. The
implementation activities will be of course, be as unique as their environments
and can take many forms. The last phase is evaluation of the whole process. The
principles of sustainability mean that there is no âend state.â ICZM is an
ongoing process which should constantly readjust the equilibrium between
economic development and the protection of the environment. Feedback is a
crucial part of the process and allows for continued effectiveness even when a
situation may change. Public participation and stakeholder involvement is
essential in ICZM processes, not only in terms of a democratic approach, but
also from a technicalâinstrumental point of view, in order to reduce
decisional conflicts (Ioppolo et al., 2013).[13]
***** ICZM in the Mediterranean[edit] *****
â¥âÃÃ At the Conference of the Plenipotentiaries on the ICZM Protocol that
took place on 20â21 January 2008 in Madrid, the ICZM Protocol was signed.
Under the presidency of the Minister of Environment of Spain, H.E. Ms. Cristina
Narbona Ruiz, fourteen Contracting Parties of the Barcelona Convention signed
the Protocol. These are the following: Algeria, Croatia, France, Greece,
Israel, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Slovenia, Spain, Syria and
Tunisia. All other Parties announced to do so in the very near future. This is
the 7th Protocol in the framework of the Barcelona Convention, and the decision
to approve the draft text and recommendation to the Conference of the
Plenipotentiaries to sign it was taken at the 15th Ordinary Meeting of the
Contracting Parties during their meeting in Almeria, on 15â18 January 2008.
All the parties are convinced that this Protocol is a crucial milestone in the
history of the Mediterranean_Action_Plan of the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP/MAP), the first-ever Regional Seas Programme under UNEP's
umbrella. It will allow the countries to better manage their coastal zones, as
well as to deal with the emerging coastal environmental challenges, such as the
climate change.
The ICZM_Protocol is a unique legal instrument in the entire international
community and the Mediterranean countries are proud of this fact. They are
willing to share these experiences with other coastal countries of the world.
The signing of the Protocol came after six years of dedicated work of all the
Parties. Syria entered history for being the sixth, and "enter-into-force",
country for the ICZM Protocol! Namely, the President of the Syrian Arab
Republic issued a Legislative Decree No. 85 dated 31 September 2010 for the
ratification of the ICZM Protocol. With this 6th ratification, the ICZM
Protocol entered into force one month later provided that Syria deposits the
instrument of ratification to the depositary country, i.e. Spain. In September
2012, Croatia and Morocco ratified the Protocol, which brought the number of
ratifications to 9 (Slovenia, Montenegro, Albania, Spain, France, European
Union, Syria, Croatia, Morocco).
The Action_Plan for the implementation of the ICZM Protocol 2012-2019 was
adopted on the occasion of the CoP 17, held in Paris from 8 to 10 February
2012. The core purposes and objectives of this Action Plan are to implement the
Protocol based on country-based planning and regional co-ordination, namely: 1.
Support the effective implementation of the ICZM Protocol at regional, national
and local levels including through a Common Regional Framework for ICZM; 2.
Strengthen the capacities of Contracting Parties to implement the Protocol and
use in an effective manner ICZM policies, instruments, tools and processes; and
3. Promote the ICZM Protocol and its implementation within the region, and
promote it globally by developing synergies with relevant Conventions and
Agreements.
A road-map for the implementation of the ICZM Process, prepared by Priority
Actions_Programme_Regional_Activity_Centre_(PAP/RAC), is available on the
Coastal Wiki platform of the PEGASO and ENCORA projects: ICZM_Process.
On May 8, 2014 the Israeli Government ratified the ICZM Protocol. This
Resolution (#1588) was made in accordance with Article 19(b) of the Government
Rules of Procedure. The ICZM Protocol ratification by Israel brings the number
of ratifications to 10.
It has become tradition in the Mediterranean to celebrate the Coast Day after
it had first been organised in 2007. The main purpose of the Mediterranean
Coast_Day is to raise awareness of the importance of the coast as both natural
and economic resource, as well as to warn of the risks to which it is exposed
due to natural phenomena and human actions. September 25 was chosen as the
Mediterranean Coast Day to honour the date when Slovenia ratified the ICZM
Protocol as the first Mediterranean country to do so. Each year the central
Mediterranean celebration is organised in a different country, while other
countries organise their own events. Thus, in 2007 and 2008 the central
celebration was organised in Sardinia, Italy. In 2009 the host to the central
celebration was Turkey, in 2010 Slovenia, in 2011 Algeria, in 2012 Croatia, in
2013 Italy and in 2014 Tunisia. In 2014, a short animated movie âA_good
climate_for_changeâ was produced by PAP/RAC (in co-operation with BONOBO
Studio Zagreb, Croatia) for the 2014 Mediterranean Coast Day. The movie was
officially launched on the occasion of the central regional celebration of the
Mediterranean Coast Day in Tunisia which was organised in the frame of the
MedPartnership project.
***** Constraints of ICZM[edit] *****
Major constraints of ICZM are mostly institutional, rather than technological.
[10] The âtop-downâ approach of administrative decision making sees
problematisation as a tool promoting ICZM through the idea of sustainability.
[10] Community-based âbottom-upâ approaches can perceive problems and
issues that are specific to a local area. The benefit of this is that the
problems are real and acknowledged rather than searched for to fit an imposed
strategy or policy. Public consultation and involvement is very important for
current âtop-downâ approaches, as it can incorporate this âbottom-upâ
idea into the policies made. Prescriptive âtop-downâ methods have not able
to effectively address problems of resource utilization in poor coastal
communities as perceptions of the coastal zone differ with regard to developed
and developing countries.[10] This leads on to another constraint to ICZM, the
idea of common property.
The coastal environment has huge historical and cultural connections with human
activity. Its wealth of resources have provided for millennia, with regard to
ICZM how does management become legally binding if the dominant perception of
the coast is of a common area available to all? And should it?[3] Enforcing
restrictions or change to activities within the coastal zone can be difficult
as these resources are often very important to peopleâs livelihoods. The idea
of the coast being common property fouls âtop-downâ approaches. The idea of
common property itself is not all that clean, This perception can lead to
cumulative exploitation of resources â the very problem this management seeks
to extinguish.
***** ICZM: The New Zealand case study[edit] *****
New Zealand is quite unique as it uses sustainable management within
legislation, with a high level of importance placed on to the coastal
environment.[2] The Resource_Management_Act (RMA) (1991) promoted sustainable
development and mandated the preparation of a New Zealand Coastal Policy
Statement (NZCPS), a national framework for coastal planning. It is the only
national policy statement that was mandatory.[14] All subsequent planning must
not be inconsistent with the NZCPS, making it a very important document.[2]
Regional authorities are required to produce Regional coastal policy plans
under the RMA (1991) but strangely enough, they only need to include the marine
environment seaward of the mean high water mark. But many regional councils
have chosen to integrate the âdryâ landward area within their plans,
breaking down the artificial barriers.[2] This attempt at ICZM is still in its
early days running into many legislative hurdles and is yet to achieve a fully
ecosystems-based approach. But as part of ICZM, evaluation and adoption of
changes is important and ongoing changes to the NZCPS in the form of reviews is
currently happening.[14] This will provide an excellent stepping stone for
future initiatives and the development of a fully integrated form of coastal
management.
***** ICZM: The Iran case study[edit] *****
Preparation of comprehensive management plans for optimum utilization of
existent sources and potentials in all developed and developing countries is
one of the appropriate approaches for constant and permanent utilization of
natural, human and financial sources. The versatility of natural sources in
coastal areas has made private and governmental users and investors to
participate in this section to gain the utmost profits. Therefore, the
necessity of preparation and implementation of management plans for perpetual
utilization of existent sources in coastal areas has become inevitable. Iran,
possessing some 6000 km of coastline in north and south, owns abundant economic
capacities in coastal zones and regarding the versatility of nature and coast
operators and management of coastal activities and operations, necessity of
attention to Integrated Coastal Zone Management becomes more significant. Such
necessity has gained its legal support through ratification of arrangements no.
40 from transportation chapter of third and article no. 63 of fourth economic,
social and cultural economic schedule and its executive regulations. The
General Director of coasts and ports engineering of Ports and Maritime
Organization was detailed to take the studies of ICZM into consideration. The
first phase of these studies began in spring 2003 and was fulfilled in autumn
2006. The outcome of this phase was compilation of following reports
accomplished by several national and international skilled consultants: 1-
Project Methodology 2- Scrutinized scope of services related to studies 3-
Investigation of studies' needs and project preparation and performance 4-
Study, definition and determination of Iranian coastal zones boundaries 6-
Investigation of International concepts, methods and experiences about
Integrated Coastal Zone Management 7- Study and investigation of different
features of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Iran 8- Preparation and
designation of geographic database 9- Purchasing and preparing basic data The
second phase of studies started up in autumn 2005 and since then this phase has
been fully accomplished and presented, In which six competent Iranian
consultants with some cooperation of international consultants are responsible
for preparing the eleven results of second part of the studies.[15]
***** The European Union[edit] *****
The European_Parliament and the European_Council "adopted in 2002 a
Recommendation on Integrated Coastal Zone Management which defines the
principles sound coastal planning and management. These include the need to
base planning on sound and shared knowledge, the need to take a long-term and
cross-sector perspective, to pro-actively involve stakeholders and the need to
take into account both the terrestrial and the marine components of the coastal
zone".[16]
***** Conclusion[edit] *****
The Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) appears to be a key element for
the sustainable development of these zones. However this recent notion may not
be adapted to all cases.[17] The natural disasters Sumatra_earthquake and the
Indian_Ocean_tsunami have made a lot of impact on the coastal environment and
also the stakeholder's perception on mitigation and management of coastal
hazards.[18] Successful implementation is still a major challenge to the idea
of ICZM .
