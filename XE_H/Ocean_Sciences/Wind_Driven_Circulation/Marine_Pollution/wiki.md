****** Marine pollution ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
While marine pollution can be obvious, as with the marine_debris shown above,
it is often the pollutants that cannot be seen that cause most harm.
Marine pollution occurs when harmful effects result from the entry into the
ocean of chemicals, particles, industrial, agricultural, and residential waste,
noise, or the spread of invasive_organisms. Eighty percent of marine pollution
comes from land. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off
pesticides or dirt into the ocean. Land and air pollution have proven to be
harmful to marine life and its habitats.[1]
The pollution often comes from nonpoint_sources such as agricultural runoff,
wind-blown debris, and dust. Nutrient_pollution, a form of water_pollution,
refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause
of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually
nitrates or phosphates, stimulate algae growth. Many potentially toxic
chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and
benthic_animals, most of which are either deposit_feeders or filter_feeders. In
this way, the toxins are concentrated_upward within ocean food_chains. Many
particles combine chemically in a manner highly depletive of oxygen, causing
estuaries to become anoxic.
When pesticides are incorporated into the marine_ecosystem, they quickly become
absorbed into marine food_webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can
cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as
the entire food web. Toxic_metals can also be introduced into marine food webs.
These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behaviour,
reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many animal_feeds have
a high fish_meal or fish_hydrolysate content. In this way, marine toxins can be
transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.
In order to protect the ocean from marine pollution, policies have been
developed internationally. There are different ways for the ocean to get
polluted, therefore there have been multiple laws, policies, and treaties put
into place throughout history.

***** History[edit] *****
Parties to the MARPOL_73/78 convention on marine pollution
Although marine pollution has a long history, significant international laws to
counter it were not enacted until the twentieth century. Marine pollution was a
concern during several United_Nations_Conventions_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea
beginning in the 1950s. Most scientists believed that the oceans were so vast
that they had unlimited ability to dilute, and thus render pollution harmless.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there were several controversies about
dumping radioactive waste off the coasts of the United States by companies
licensed by the Atomic_Energy_Commission, into the Irish Sea from the British
reprocessing facility at Windscale, and into the Mediterranean Sea by the
French Commissariat_Ã _l'Energie_Atomique. After the Mediterranean Sea
controversy, for example, Jacques_Cousteau became a worldwide figure in the
campaign to stop marine pollution. Marine pollution made further international
headlines after the 1967 crash of the oil tanker Torrey_Canyon, and after the
1969 Santa_Barbara_oil_spill off the coast of California.
Marine pollution was a major area of discussion during the 1972 United_Nations
Conference_on_the_Human_Environment, held in Stockholm. That year also saw the
signing of the Convention_on_the_Prevention_of_Marine_Pollution_by_Dumping_of
Wastes_and_Other_Matter, sometimes called the London Convention. The London
Convention did not ban marine pollution, but it established black and gray
lists for substances to be banned (black) or regulated by national authorities
(gray). Cyanide and high-level radioactive waste, for example, were put on the
black list. The London Convention applied only to waste dumped from ships, and
thus did nothing to regulate waste discharged as liquids from pipelines.[2]
***** Pathways of pollution[edit] *****
See also: Water_pollution
Septic river.
There are many ways to categorize and examine the inputs of pollution into
marine ecosystems. Patin (n.d.) notes that generally there are three main types
of inputs of pollution into the ocean: direct discharge of waste into the
oceans, runoff into the waters due to rain, and pollutants released from the
atmosphere.[3]
One common path of entry by contaminants to the sea are rivers. The evaporation
of water from oceans exceeds precipitation. The balance is restored by rain
over the continents entering rivers and then being returned to the sea. The
Hudson in New_York_State and the Raritan in New_Jersey, which empty at the
northern and southern ends of Staten_Island, are a source of mercury
contamination of zooplankton (copepods) in the open ocean. The highest
concentration in the filter-feeding copepods is not at the mouths of these
rivers but 70 miles (110 km) south, nearer Atlantic_City, because water flows
close to the coast. It takes a few days before toxins are taken up by the
plankton.[4]
Pollution is often classed as point_source or nonpoint_source_pollution. Point
source pollution occurs when there is a single, identifiable, localized source
of the pollution. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial
waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing
nations. Nonpoint source pollution occurs when the pollution comes from ill-
defined and diffuse sources. These can be difficult to regulate. Agricultural
runoff and wind blown debris are prime examples.
**** Direct discharge[edit] ****
Acid mine drainage in the Rio Tinto River.
See also: Sewerage, Industrial_waste, and Environmental_impact_of_mining
Pollutants enter rivers and the sea directly from urban sewerage and industrial
waste discharges, sometimes in the form of hazardous and toxic_wastes, or in
the form of plastics.
In a study published by Science, Jambeck et al (2015) estimated that the 10
largest emitters of oceanic plastic pollution worldwide are, from the most to
the least, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt,
Malaysia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh.[5]
Inland mining for copper, gold, etc., is another source of marine pollution.
Most of the pollution is simply soil, which ends up in rivers flowing to the
sea. However, some minerals discharged in the course of the mining can cause
problems, such as copper, a common industrial pollutant, which can interfere
with the life_history and development of coral polyps.[6] Mining has a poor
environmental track record. For example, according to the United_States
Environmental_Protection_Agency, mining has contaminated portions of the
headwaters of over 40% of watersheds in the western continental US.[7] Much of
this pollution finishes up in the sea.
**** Land runoff[edit] ****
Main article: Surface_runoff
See also: Urban_runoff, Stormwater, and Nutrient_pollution
Surface_runoff from farming, as well as urban_runoff and runoff from the
construction of roads, buildings, ports, channels, and harbours, can carry soil
and particles laden with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and minerals. This
nutrient-rich water can cause fleshy algae and phytoplankton to thrive in
coastal areas; known as algal_blooms, which have the potential to create
hypoxic conditions by using all available oxygen. In the coast of southwest
Florida, harmful algal_blooms have existed for over 100 years.[8] These algal
blooms have been a cause of species of fish, turtles, dolphins, and shrimp to
die and cause harmful effects on humans who swim in the water.[8]
Polluted runoff from roads and highways can be a significant source of water
pollution in coastal areas. About 75% of the toxic chemicals that flow into
Puget_Sound are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways,
rooftops, yards and other developed land.[9] In California, there are many
rainstorms that runoff into the ocean. These rainstorms occur from October to
March, and these runoff waters contain petroleum, heavy metals, pollutants from
emissions, etc.[10]
In China, there is a large coastal population that pollutes the ocean through
land runoff. This includes sewage discharge and pollution from urbanization and
land use. In 2001, more than 66,795 miÂ² of the Chinese coastal ocean waters
were rated less than Class I of the Sea Water Quality Standard of China.[11]
Much of this pollution came from Ag, Cu, Cd, Pb, As, DDT, PCBs, etc., which
occurred from contamination through land runoff.[11]
**** Ship pollution[edit] ****
Main article: Environmental_impact_of_shipping
See also: Ballast_water_discharge_and_the_environment
A cargo ship pumps ballast water over the side.
Ships can pollute waterways and oceans in many ways. Oil_spills can have
devastating effects. While being toxic to marine life, polycyclic_aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), found in crude_oil, are very difficult to clean up, and
last for years in the sediment and marine environment.[12][page needed]
Oil spills are probably the most emotive of marine pollution events. However,
while a tanker wreck may result in extensive newspaper headlines, much of the
oil in the world's seas comes from other smaller sources, such as tankers
discharging ballast water from oil tanks used on return ships, leaking
pipelines or engine oil disposed of down sewers.[13][page needed]
Discharge of cargo residues from bulk_carriers can pollute ports, waterways,
and oceans. In many instances vessels intentionally discharge illegal wastes
despite foreign and domestic regulation prohibiting such actions. An absence of
national standards provides an incentive for some cruise_liners to dump waste
in places where the penalties are inadequate.[14] It has been estimated that
container_ships lose over 10,000 containers at sea each year (usually during
storms).[15] Ships also create noise_pollution that disturbs natural wildlife,
and water from ballast tanks can spread harmful algae and other invasive
species.[16]
Ballast_water taken up at sea and released in port is a major source of
unwanted exotic marine life. The invasive freshwater zebra mussels, native to
the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas, were probably transported to the Great Lakes
via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel.[17] Meinesz believes that one of
the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can
be attributed to a seemingly harmless jellyfish. Mnemiopsis_leidyi, a species
of comb jellyfish that spread so it now inhabits estuaries in many parts of the
world. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to
the Black_Sea in a ship's ballast water. The population of the jellyfish grew
exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing
industry. "The anchovy catch fell from 204,000 tons in 1984 to 200 tons in
1993; sprat from 24,600 tons in 1984 to 12,000 tons in 1993; horse mackerel
from 4,000 tons in 1984 to zero in 1993."[16] Now that the jellyfish have
exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen
dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem.
Invasive_species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of
new diseases, introduce new genetic material, alter underwater seascapes, and
jeopardize the ability of native_species to obtain food. Invasive species are
responsible for about $138 billion annually in lost revenue and management
costs in the US alone.[18]
**** Atmospheric pollution[edit] ****
A graph linking atmospheric dust to various coral deaths across the Caribbean
Sea and Florida.[19]
Another pathway of pollution occurs through the atmosphere. Wind-blown dust and
debris, including plastic_bags, are blown seaward from landfills and other
areas. Dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the
subtropical_ridge moves into the Caribbean and Florida during the warm season
as the ridge builds and moves northward through the subtropical Atlantic. Dust
can also be attributed to a global transport from the Gobi and Taklamakan
deserts across Korea, Japan, and the Northern Pacific to the Hawaiian_Islands.
[20]
Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa.
There is a large variability in dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida
from year to year;[21] however, the flux is greater during positive phases of
the North_Atlantic_Oscillation.[22] The USGS links dust events to a decline in
the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the
1970s.[23]
Climate_change_is_raising_ocean_temperatures[24] and raising levels of carbon
dioxide_in_the_atmosphere. These rising levels of carbon dioxide are acidifying
the_oceans.[25] This, in turn, is altering aquatic_ecosystems and modifying
fish distributions,[26] with impacts on the sustainability_of_fisheries and the
livelihoods of the communities that depend on them. Healthy ocean ecosystems
are also important for the mitigation of climate change.[27]
**** Deep sea mining[edit] ****
Main article: Deep_sea_mining
Deep_sea_mining is a relatively new mineral retrieval process that takes place
on the ocean_floor. Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of
polymetallic_nodules or active and extinct hydrothermal_vents at about 1,400
â 3,700 meters below the ocean's surface.[28] The vents create sulfide
deposits, which contain precious_metals such as silver, gold, copper,
manganese, cobalt, and zinc.[29][30] The deposits are mined using either
hydraulic pumps or bucket systems that take ore to the surface to be processed.
As with all mining operations, deep sea mining raises questions about
environmental damages to the surrounding areas
Because deep sea mining is a relatively new field, the complete consequences of
full-scale mining operations are unknown. However, experts are certain that
removal of parts of the sea floor will result in disturbances to the benthic
layer, increased toxicity of the water_column, and sediment plumes from
tailings.[29] Removing parts of the sea floor disturbs the habitat of benthic
organisms, possibly, depending on the type of mining and location, causing
permanent disturbances.[28] Aside from direct impact of mining the area,
leakage, spills, and corrosion would alter the mining area's chemical makeup.
Among the impacts of deep sea mining, sediment plumes could have the greatest
impact. Plumes are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine
particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles
floating in the water. Two types of plumes occur: near-bottom plumes and
surface plumes.[28] Near-bottom plumes occur when the tailings are pumped back
down to the mining site. The floating particles increase the turbidity, or
cloudiness, of the water, clogging filter-feeding apparatuses used by benthic
organisms.[31] Surface plumes cause a more serious problem. Depending on the
size of the particles and water currents the plumes could spread over vast
areas.[28][32] The plumes could impact zooplankton and light penetration, in
turn affecting the food_web of the area.[28][32]
***** Types of pollution[edit] *****
**** Acidification[edit] ****
Main article: Ocean_acidification
An island with a fringing_reef in the Maldives. Coral_reefs are dying around
the world.[33]
The oceans are normally a natural carbon_sink, absorbing carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere. Because the levels of atmospheric_carbon_dioxide are
increasing, the oceans are becoming_more_acidic.[34][35] The potential
consequences of ocean acidification are not fully understood, but there are
concerns that structures made of calcium carbonate may become vulnerable to
dissolution, affecting corals and the ability of shellfish to form shells.[36]
Oceans and coastal_ecosystems play an important role in the global_carbon_cycle
and have removed about 25% of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities
between 2000 and 2007 and about half the anthropogenic CO2 released since the
start of the industrial revolution. Rising ocean temperatures and ocean
acidification means that the capacity of the ocean carbon sink will gradually
get weaker,[37] giving rise to global concerns expressed in the Monaco[38] and
Manado[39] Declarations.
A report from NOAA scientists published in the journal Science in May 2008
found that large amounts of relatively acidified water are upwelling to within
four miles of the Pacific continental_shelf area of North America. This area is
a critical zone where most local marine life lives or is born. While the paper
dealt only with areas from Vancouver to northern California, other continental
shelf areas may be experiencing similar effects.[40]
A related issue is the methane_clathrate reservoirs found under sediments on
the ocean floors. These trap large amounts of the greenhouse_gas methane, which
ocean warming has the potential to release. In 2004 the global inventory of
ocean methane clathrates was estimated to occupy between one and five million
cubic_kilometres.[41] If all these clathrates were to be spread uniformly
across the ocean floor, this would translate to a thickness between three and
fourteen metres.[42] This estimate corresponds to 500â2500 gigatonnes carbon
(Gt C), and can be compared with the 5000 Gt C estimated for all other fossil
fuel reserves.[41][43]
**** Eutrophication[edit] ****
Main article: Eutrophication
See also: Nutrient_pollution
A polluted lagoon.
The effect of eutrophication on marine benthic_life.
Eutrophication is an increase in chemical nutrients, typically compounds
containing nitrogen or phosphorus, in an ecosystem. It can result in an
increase in the ecosystem's primary_productivity (excessive plant growth and
decay), and further effects including lack of oxygen and severe reductions in
water quality, fish, and other animal populations.
The biggest culprit are rivers that empty into the ocean, and with it the many
chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock
and humans. An excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to
hypoxia and the creation of a dead_zone.[4]
Estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land-derived nutrients are
concentrated where runoff enters the marine environment in a confined channel.
The World_Resources_Institute has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around
the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and
Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan.[44] In the
ocean, there are frequent red_tide algae blooms[45] that kill fish and marine
mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when
the blooms reach close to shore.
In addition to land_runoff, atmospheric anthropogenic fixed_nitrogen can enter
the open ocean. A study in 2008 found that this could account for around one
third of the ocean's external (non-recycled) nitrogen supply and up to three
per cent of the annual new marine biological production.[46] It has been
suggested that accumulating reactive nitrogen in the environment may have
consequences as serious as putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.[47]
One proposed solution to eutrophication in estuaries is to restore shellfish
populations, such as oysters. Oyster reefs remove nitrogen from the water
column and filter out suspended solids, subsequently reducing the likelihood or
extent of harmful_algal_blooms or anoxic conditions.[48] Filter feeding
activity is considered beneficial to water quality[49] by controlling
phytoplankton density and sequestering nutrients, which can be removed from the
system through shellfish harvest, buried in the sediments, or lost through
denitrification.[50][51] Foundational work toward the idea of improving marine
water quality through shellfish cultivation to was conducted by Odd Lindahl et
al., using mussels in Sweden.[52]
**** Plastic debris[edit] ****
Main article: Marine_debris
See also: Plastic_pollution_Â§ Oceans
A mute_swan builds a nest using plastic garbage.
Marine debris is mainly discarded human rubbish which floats on, or is
suspended in the ocean. Eighty percent of marine debris is plastic â a
component that has been rapidly accumulating since the end of World War II.[53]
The mass of plastic in the oceans may be as high as 100,000,000_tonnes_
(98,000,000_long_tons;_110,000,000_short_tons).[54]
In a study published by Environmental_Science_&_Technology, Schmidt et al
(2017) calculated that the Yangtze, Indus, Yellow River, Hai River, Nile,
Ganges, Pearl River, Amur, Niger, and the Mekong "transport 88â95% of the
global [plastics] load into the sea."[55][56]
Discarded plastic_bags, six_pack_rings, cigarette_butts and other forms of
plastic waste which finish up in the ocean present dangers to wildlife and
fisheries.[57] Aquatic life can be threatened through entanglement,
suffocation, and ingestion.[58][59][60] Fishing_nets, usually made of plastic,
can be left or lost in the ocean by fishermen. Known as ghost_nets, these
entangle fish, dolphins, sea_turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds,
crabs, and other creatures, restricting movement, causing starvation,
laceration, infection, and, in those that need to return to the surface to
breathe, suffocation.[61]
The remains of an albatross containing ingested flotsam.
Many animals that live on or in the sea consume flotsam by mistake, as it often
looks similar to their natural prey.[62] Plastic debris, when bulky or tangled,
is difficult to pass, and may become permanently lodged in the digestive tracts
of these animals. Especially when evolutionary adaptions make it impossible for
the likes of turtles to reject plastic bags, which resemble jellyfish when
immersed in water, as they have a system in their throat to stop slippery foods
from otherwise escaping.[63] Thereby blocking the passage of food and causing
death through starvation or infection.[64][65]
Plastics accumulate because they don't biodegrade in the way many other
substances do. They will photodegrade on exposure to the sun, but they do so
properly only under dry conditions, and water inhibits this process.[66] In
marine environments, photodegraded plastic disintegrates into ever-smaller
pieces while remaining polymers, even down to the molecular_level. When
floating plastic particles photodegrade down to zooplankton sizes, jellyfish
attempt to consume them, and in this way the plastic enters the ocean food
chain.[67][68]
Many of these long-lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and
animals,[69] including sea_turtles, and black-footed_albatross.[70] In a 2008
Pacific Gyre voyage, Algalita Marine Research Foundation researchers began
finding that fish are ingesting plastic fragments and debris. Of the 672 fish
caught during that voyage, 35% had ingested plastic pieces.[71]
Plastic debris tends to accumulate at the centre of ocean_gyres. The North
Pacific_Gyre, for example, has collected the so-called "Great_Pacific_Garbage
Patch", which is now estimated to be one to twenty times the size of Texas
(approximately from 700,000 to 15,000,000 square kilometers). There could be as
much plastic as fish in the sea.[72] It has a very high level of plastic
particulate suspended in the upper water column. In samples taken in 1999, the
mass of plastic exceeded that of zooplankton (the dominant animal life in the
area) by a factor of six.[53][73]
Midway_Atoll, in common with all the Hawaiian_Islands, receives substantial
amounts of debris from the garbage patch. Ninety percent plastic, this debris
accumulates on the beaches of Midway where it becomes a hazard to the bird
population of the island. Midway Atoll is home to two-thirds (1.5 million) of
the global population of Laysan_albatross.[74] Nearly all of these albatross
have plastic in their digestive_system[75] and one-third of their chicks die.
[76]
Toxic additives used in the manufacture of plastic materials can leach out into
their surroundings when exposed to water. Waterborne hydrophobic pollutants
collect_and_magnify_on_the_surface of plastic debris,[54] thus making plastic
far more deadly in the ocean than it would be on land.[53] Hydrophobic
contaminants are also known to bioaccumulate in fatty tissues, biomagnifying up
the food chain and putting pressure on apex_predators. Some plastic additives
are known to disrupt the endocrine_system when consumed, others can suppress
the immune system or decrease reproductive rates.[73]
Floating debris can also absorb persistent_organic_pollutants from seawater,
including PCBs, DDT, and PAHs.[77] Aside from toxic effects,[78] when ingested
some of these affect animal brain cells similarly to estradiol, causing hormone
disruption in the affected wildlife.[70] Saido, a chemist with the College of
Pharmacy, conducted a study in Nihon University, Chiba,_Japan, that discovered,
when plastics eventually decompose, they produce potentially toxic bisphenol A
(BPA) and PS oligomer into the water.[79] These toxins are believed to bring
harm to the marine life living in the area.
A growing concern regarding plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem is the
use of microplastics. Microplastics are little beads of plastic less than 5
millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in hand soaps, face cleansers,
and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the microplastics go
through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their
small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment
screens on wastewater plants.[80] These beads are harmful to the organisms in
the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the
plastic and become sick. The microplastics are such a concern because it is
difficult to clean them up due to their size, so humans can try to avoid using
these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use environmentally safe
exfoliates.
**** Toxins[edit] ****
See also: Mercury_in_fish
Apart from plastics, there are particular problems with other toxins that do
not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment. Examples of persistent
toxins are PCBs, DDT, TBT, pesticides, furans, dioxins, phenols, and
radioactive_waste. Heavy_metals are metallic chemical elements that have a
relatively high density and are toxic or poisonous at low concentrations.
Examples are mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic, and cadmium. Such toxins can
accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called
bioaccumulation. They are also known to accumulate in benthic_environments,
such as estuaries and bay_muds: a geological record of human activities of the
last century.
  Specific examples
    * Chinese and Russian industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals
      in the Amur_River have devastated fish stocks and damaged its estuary
      soil.[81]
    * Wabamun_Lake in Alberta, Canada, once the best whitefish lake in the
      area, now has unacceptable levels of heavy metals in its sediment and
      fish.
    * Acute and chronic pollution events have been shown to impact southern
      California kelp forests, though the intensity of the impact seems to
      depend on both the nature of the contaminants and duration of exposure.
      [82][83][84][85][86]
    * Due to their high position in the food_chain and the subsequent
      accumulation of heavy_metals from their diet, mercury levels can be high
      in larger species such as bluefin and albacore. As a result, in March
      2004 the United_States FDA issued guidelines recommending that pregnant
      women, nursing mothers and children limit their intake of tuna and other
      types of predatory fish.[87]
    * Some shellfish and crabs can survive polluted environments, accumulating
      heavy metals or toxins in their tissues. For example, mitten_crabs have a
      remarkable ability to survive in highly modified aquatic_habitats,
      including polluted waters.[88] The farming and harvesting of such species
      needs careful management if they are to be used as a food.[89][90]
    * Surface runoff of pesticides can alter the gender of fish species
      genetically, transforming male into female fish.[91]
    * Heavy metals enter the environment through oil_spills â such as the
      Prestige_oil_spill on the Galician coast and Gulf of Mexico which
      unleashed an estimated 3.19 million barrels of oil[92] â or from other
      natural or anthropogenic_sources.
    * In 2005, the 'Ndrangheta, an Italian mafia syndicate, was accused of
      sinking_at_least_30_ships_loaded_with_toxic_waste,_much_of_it
      radioactive. This has led to widespread investigations into radioactive
      waste_disposal rackets.[93]
    * Since the end of World War II, various nations, including the Soviet
      Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, have disposed
      of chemical weapons in the Baltic_Sea, raising concerns of environmental
      contamination.[94][95]
    * The damaging of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 caused
      radioactive toxins to leak into the air and ocean. There are still many
      isotopes in the ocean, which directly affects the benthic food web and
      also affects the whole food chain. The concentration of 137Cs in the
      bottom sediment that was contaminated by water with high concentrations
      in AprilâMay 2011 remains quite high and is showing signs of very slow
      decrease with time.[96]
**** Underwater noise[edit] ****
See also: Noise_pollution, Acoustic_ecology, The_Effects_of_Noise_on_Aquatic
Life, and Marine_mammals_and_sonar
Marine life can be susceptible to noise or the sound pollution from sources
such as passing ships, oil exploration seismic surveys, and naval low-frequency
active sonar. Sound travels more rapidly and over larger distances in the sea
than in the atmosphere. Marine animals, such as cetaceans, often have weak
eyesight, and live in a world largely defined by acoustic information. This
applies also to many deeper sea fish, who live in a world of darkness.[97]
Between 1950 and 1975, ambient noise at one location in the Pacific Ocean
increased by about ten decibels (that is a tenfold increase in intensity).[98]
Noise also makes species communicate louder, which is called the Lombard vocal
response.[99] Whale_songs are longer when submarine-detectors are on.[100] If
creatures don't "speak" loud enough, their voice can be masked by anthropogenic
sounds. These unheard voices might be warnings, finding of prey, or
preparations of net-bubbling. When one species begins speaking louder, it will
mask other species voices, causing the whole ecosystem to eventually speak
louder.[101]
According to the oceanographer Sylvia_Earle, "Undersea noise pollution is like
the death of a thousand cuts. Each sound in itself may not be a matter of
critical concern, but taken all together, the noise from shipping, seismic
surveys, and military activity is creating a totally different environment than
existed even 50 years ago. That high level of noise is bound to have a hard,
sweeping impact on life in the sea."[102]
Noise from ships and human activity can damage Cnidarians and Ctenophora, which
are very important organisms in the marine ecosystem. They promote high
diversity and they are used as models for ecology and biology because of their
simple structures. When there is underwater noise, the vibrations in the water
damage the cilia hairs in the Coelenterates. In a study, the organisms were
exposed to sound waves for different numbers of times and the results showed
that damaged hair cells were extruded or missing or presented bent, flaccid or
missed kinocilia and stereocilia.[103]
***** Adaptation and mitigation[edit] *****
Aerosol can pollute beaches.
Much anthropogenic pollution ends up in the ocean. The 2011 edition of the
United_Nations_Environment_Programme Year Book identifies as the main emerging
environmental issues the loss to the oceans of massive amounts of phosphorus,
"a valuable fertilizer needed to feed a growing global population", and the
impact billions of pieces of plastic waste are having globally on the health of
marine environments.[104]
Bjorn Jennssen (2003) notes in his article, "Anthropogenic pollution may reduce
biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems, resulting in reduction and
depletion of human marine food resources".[105] There are two ways the overall
level of this pollution can be mitigated: either the human population is
reduced, or a way is found to reduce the ecological_footprint left behind by
the average human. If the second way is not adopted, then the first way may be
imposed as the world ecosystems falter.
The second way is for humans, individually, to pollute less. That requires
social and political will, together with a shift in awareness so more people
respect the environment and are less disposed to abuse it.[106] At an
operational level, regulations, and international government participation is
needed.[107] It is often very difficult to regulate marine pollution because
pollution spreads over international barriers, thus making regulations hard to
create as well as enforce.[108]
Without appropriate awareness of marine pollution, the necessary global will to
effectively address the issues may prove inadequate. Balanced information on
the sources and harmful effects of marine pollution need to become part of
general public awareness, and ongoing research is required to fully establish,
and keep current, the scope of the issues. As expressed in Daoji and Dag's
research,[109] one of the reasons why environmental concern is lacking among
the Chinese is because the public awareness is low and therefore should be
targeted.
The amount of awareness on marine pollution is vital to the support of keeping
the prevention of trash from entering waterways and ending up in our oceans.
The EPA reports that in 2014 Americans generated about 258 million tons of
waste, and only a third was recycled or composted. In 2015, there was over 8
million tons of plastic that made it into the ocean. The Ocean_Conservancy
reported that China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam dump more
plastic in the sea than all other countries combined.[110] Through more
sustainable packing this could lead to; eliminating toxic constituents, using
fewer materials, making more readily available recyclable plastic. However,
awareness can only take these initiatives so far. The most abundant plastic is
PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) and is the most resistant to biodegradables.
Researchers have been making great strides in combating this problem. In one
way has been by adding a special polymer called a tetrablock copolymer. The
tetrablock copolymer acts as a laminate between the PE and iPP which enables
for an easier breakdown but still be tough. Through more awareness, individuals
will become more cognizant of their carbon footprints. Also, from research and
technology, more strides can be made to aid in the plastic pollution problem.
[111][112]
In 2018 a survey of Global Oceanic Environmental Survey (GOES) Foundation find
that the ecosystem in seas and oceans can collapse in the next 25 years what
would fail the terrestrial ecosystem and end the life on earth as we know them.
The main causes: Plastic_pollution, Ocean_acidification, Ocean_pollution. For
prevent that scenario from happen, we need a total single use plastic ban, ban
on wood burning, planting as many trees as possible, " pollution-free recycling
of electronics and by 2030 all industries to be zero toxic discharge." "special
protection and perservation of peat bogs, wetlands, marshlands and mangrove
swamps to ensure carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere.[113][114]"
***** Laws and policies[edit] *****
    * In 1948, Harry Truman signed a law formerly known as the Federal_Water
      Pollution_Control_Act[115] that allowed the federal government to control
      marine pollution in United States of America.
    * In 1972, the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 was
      passed by the Council_on_Environmental_Quality which controls ocean
      dumping.[116][116]
    * In 1973 and 1978, MARPOL_73/78 was a treaty written to control vessel
      pollution, especially regarding oil. In 1983, the International
      Convention_for_the_Prevention_of_Pollution_from_Ships enforced the MARPOL
      73/78 treaty internationally.[117]
    * The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was
      established to protect the marine environment by governing states to
      control their pollution to the ocean. It put restrictions on the amount
      of toxins and pollutants that come from all ships internationally.[118]
