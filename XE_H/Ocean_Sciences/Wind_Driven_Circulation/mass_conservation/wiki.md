The law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that
for any system_closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the
system must remain constant over time, as system's mass cannot change, so
quantity can neither be added nor be removed. Hence, the quantity of mass is
conserved over time.
The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may
be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in
form. For example, in chemical_reactions, the mass of the chemical components
before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction.
Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic_processes in an
isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must
be equal to the mass of the products.
The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as
chemistry, mechanics, and fluid_dynamics. Historically, mass conservation was
demonstrated in chemical reactions independently by Mikhail_Lomonosov and later
rediscovered by Antoine_Lavoisier in the late 18th century. The formulation of
this law was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern
natural_science of chemistry.
The conservation of mass only holds approximately and is considered part of a
series of assumptions coming from classical_mechanics. The law has to be
modified to comply with the laws of quantum_mechanics and special_relativity
under the principle of mass-energy_equivalence, which states that energy and
mass form one conserved quantity. For very energetic systems the conservation
of mass-only is shown not to hold, as is the case in nuclear_reactions and
particle-antiparticle annihilation in particle_physics.
Mass is also not generally conserved in open_systems. Such is the case when
various forms of energy and matter are allowed into, or out of, the system.
However, unless radioactivity or nuclear reactions are involved, the amount of
energy escaping (or entering) such systems as heat, mechanical_work, or
electromagnetic_radiation is usually too small to be measured as a decrease (or
increase) in the mass of the system.
For systems where large gravitational fields are involved, general_relativity
has to be taken into account, where mass-energy conservation becomes a more
complex concept, subject to different definitions, and neither mass nor energy
is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity.

***** Formulation and examples[edit] *****
The law of conservation of mass can only be formulated in classical_mechanics
when the energy scales associated to an isolated system are much smaller than
m  c  2     {\displaystyle mc^{2}}  [mc^2], where     m   {\displaystyle m}
[m] is the mass of a typical object in the system, measured in the frame_of
reference where the object is at rest, and     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] is
the speed_of_light.
The law can be formulated mathematically in the fields of fluid_mechanics and
continuum_mechanics, where the conservation of mass is usually expressed using
the continuity_equation, given in differential_form as
           &#x2202; &#x03C1;   &#x2202; t    + &#x2207; &#x22C5;
     ( &#x03C1;  v  ) = 0 ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }
     {\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {v} )=0,}  [{\displaystyle
     {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {v}
     )=0,}]
where     &#x03C1;   {\textstyle \rho }  [{\textstyle \rho }] is the density
(mass per unit volume),     t   {\textstyle t}  [{\textstyle t}] is the time,
&#x2207; &#x22C5;   {\textstyle \nabla \cdot }  [{\textstyle \nabla \cdot }] is
the divergence, and      v    {\textstyle \mathbf {v} }  [{\textstyle \mathbf
{v} }] is the flow_velocity field. The interpretation of the continuity
equation for mass is the following: For a given closed surface in the system,
the change in time of the mass enclosed by the surface is equal to the mass
that traverses the surface, positive if matter goes in and negative if matter
goes out. For the whole isolated system, this condition implies that the total
mass     M   {\textstyle M}  [{\textstyle M}], sum of the masses of all
components in the system, does not change in time, i.e.
            d  M    d  t    =   d   d  t    &#x222B; &#x03C1;  d  V = 0
     {\displaystyle {\frac {{\text{d}}M}{{\text{d}}t}}={\frac {\text{d}}{
     {\text{d}}t}}\int \rho {\text{d}}V=0}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {{\text
     {d}}M}{{\text{d}}t}}={\frac {\text{d}}{{\text{d}}t}}\int \rho {\text
     {d}}V=0}],
where      d  V   {\textstyle {\text{d}}V}  [{\textstyle {\text{d}}V}] is the
differential that defines the integral over the whole volume of the system.
The continuity equation for the mass is part of Euler_equations of fluid
dynamics. Many other convectionâdiffusion_equations describe the conservation
and flow of mass and matter in a given system.
In chemistry, the calculation of the amount of reactant and products in a
chemical reaction, or stoichiometry, is founded on the principle of
conservation of mass. The principle implies that during a chemical reaction the
total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products. For
example, in the following reaction
      CH
      4 + 2 O
      2 â CO
      2 + 2 H
      2O,
where one molecule of methane (CH
4) and two oxygen molecules O
2 are converted into one molecule of carbon_dioxide (CO
2) and two of water (H
2O). The number of molecules as result from the reaction can be derived from
the principle of conservation of mass, as initially four hydrogen atoms, 4
oxygen atoms and one carbon atom are present (as well as in the final state),
then the number water molecules produced must be exactly two per molecule of
carbon dioxide produced.
Many engineering problems are solved by following the mass distribution in time
of a given system, this practice is known as mass_balance.
***** History[edit] *****
Russian scientist Mikhail_Lomonosov discovered the law of mass conservation in
1756 by experiments, and came to the conclusion that phlogiston_theory is
incorrect.[1][2][3]
Antoine_Lavoisier's discovery of the law of conservation of mass led to many
new findings in the 19th century. Joseph_Proust's law_of_definite_proportions
and John_Dalton's atomic_theory branched from the discoveries of Antoine
Lavoisier. Lavoisier's quantitative experiments revealed that combustion
involved oxygen rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston.
An important idea in ancient_Greek_philosophy was that "Nothing_comes_from
nothing", so that what exists now has always existed: no new matter can come
into existence where there was none before. An explicit statement of this,
along with the further principle that nothing can pass away into nothing, is
found in Empedocles (approx. 4th century BC): "For it is impossible for
anything to come to be from what is not, and it cannot be brought about or
heard of that what is should be utterly destroyed."[4]
A further principle of conservation was stated by Epicurus around 3rd century
BC, who, describing the nature of the Universe, wrote that "the totality of
things was always such as it is now, and always will be".[5]
Jain_philosophy, a non-creationist_philosophy based on the teachings of
Mahavira (6th century BC),[6] states that the universe and its constituents
such as matter cannot be destroyed or created. The Jain_text Tattvarthasutra
(2nd century CE) states that a substance is permanent, but its modes are
characterised by creation and destruction.[7] A principle of the conservation
of matter was also stated by NasÄ«r_al-DÄ«n_al-TÅ«sÄ« (around 13th century CE).
He wrote that "A body of matter cannot disappear completely. It only changes
its form, condition, composition, color and other properties and turns into a
different complex or elementary matter".[8]
**** Discoveries in chemistry[edit] ****
By the 18th_century the principle of conservation of mass during chemical
reactions was widely used and was an important assumption during experiments,
even before a definition was formally established,[9] as can be seen in the
works of Joseph_Black, Henry_Cavendish, and Jean_Rey.[10] The first to outline
the principle was given by Mikhail_Lomonosov in 1756. He demonstrated it by
experiments and had discussed the principle before in 1774 in correspondence
with Leonhard_Euler, though his claim on the subject is sometimes challenged.
[11][12] A more refined series of experiments were later carried out by Antoine
Lavoisier who expressed his conclusion in 1773 and popularized the principle of
conservation of mass. The demonstrations of the principle led alternatives
theories obsolete, like the phlogiston_theory that claimed that mass could be
gained or lost in combustion and heat processes.
The conservation of mass was obscure for millennia because of the buoyancy
effect of the Earth's atmosphere on the weight of gases. For example, a piece
of wood weighs less after burning; this seemed to suggest that some of its mass
disappears, or is transformed or lost. This was not disproved until careful
experiments were performed in which chemical reactions such as rusting were
allowed to take place in sealed glass ampoules; it was found that the chemical
reaction did not change the weight of the sealed container and its contents.
Weighing of gases using scales was not possible until the invention of the
vacuum_pump in 17th century.
Once understood, the conservation of mass was of great importance in
progressing from alchemy to modern chemistry. Once early chemists realized that
chemical substances never disappeared but were only transformed into other
substances with the same weight, these scientists could for the first time
embark on quantitative studies of the transformations of substances. The idea
of mass conservation plus a surmise that certain "elemental substances" also
could not be transformed into others by chemical reactions, in turn led to an
understanding of chemical_elements, as well as the idea that all chemical
processes and transformations (such as burning and metabolic reactions) are
reactions between invariant amounts or weights of these chemical elements.
Following the pioneering work of Lavoisier, the exhaustive experiments of Jean
Stas supported the consistency of this law in chemical reactions,[13] even
though they were carried out with other intentions. His research[14][15]
indicated that in certain reactions the loss or gain could not have been more
than from 2 to 4 parts in 100,000.[16] The difference in the accuracy aimed at
and attained by Lavoisier on the one hand, and by Morley and Stas on the other,
is enormous.[17]
**** Modern physics[edit] ****
The law of conservation of mass was challenged with the advent of special
relativity. In one of the Annus_Mirabilis_papers of Albert_Einstein in 1905, he
suggested an equivalence between mass and energy. This theory implied several
assertions, like the idea that internal energy of a system could contribute to
the mass of the whole system, or that mass could be converted into
electromagnetic_radiation. However, as Max_Planck pointed out, a change in mass
as a result of extraction or addition of chemical energy, as predicted by
Einstein's theory, is so small that it could not be measured with the available
instruments and could not be presented as a test to the special relativity.
Einstein speculated that the energies associated with newly discovered
radioactivity were significant enough, compared with the mass of systems
producing them, to enable their mass-change to be measured, once the energy of
the reaction had been removed from the system. This later indeed proved to be
possible, although it was eventually to be the first artificial nuclear
transmutation reaction in 1932, demonstrated by Cockcroft_and_Walton, that
proved the first successful test of Einstein's theory regarding mass-loss with
energy-loss.
The law conservation of mass and the analogous law of conservation_of_energy
were finally overruled by a more general principle known as the massâenergy
equivalence. Special relativity also redefines the concept of mass and energy,
which can be used interchangeably and are relative to the frame of reference.
Several definitions had to be defined for consistency like rest_mass of a
particle (mass in the rest frame of the particle) and relativistic mass (in
another frame). The latter term is usually less frequently used. For more
discussion, see Mass_in_special_relativity.
***** Generalization[edit] *****

**** Special relativity[edit] ****
Main article: Mass_in_special_relativity
In special relativity, the conservation of mass does not apply if the system is
open and energy escapes. However, it does continue to apply to totally closed
(isolated) systems. If energy cannot escape a system, its mass cannot decrease.
In relativity theory, so long as any type of energy is retained within a
system, this energy exhibits mass.
Also, mass must be differentiated from matter (see below), since matter may not
be perfectly conserved in isolated systems, even though mass is always
conserved in such systems. However, matter is so nearly conserved in chemistry
that violations of matter conservation were not measured until the nuclear age,
and the assumption of matter conservation remains an important practical
concept in most systems in chemistry and other studies that do not involve the
high energies typical of radioactivity and nuclear_reactions.
*** The mass associated with chemical amounts of energy is too small to measure
[edit] ***
The change in mass of certain kinds of open systems where atoms or massive
particles are not allowed to escape, but other types of energy (such as light
or heat) are allowed to enter or escape, went unnoticed during the 19th
century, because the change in mass associated with addition or loss of small
quantities of thermal or radiant energy in chemical reactions is very small.
(In theory, mass would not change at all for experiments conducted in isolated
systems where heat and work were not allowed in or out.)
*** Mass conservation remains correct if energy is not lost[edit] ***
The conservation of relativistic_mass implies the viewpoint of a single
observer (or the view from a single inertial frame) since changing inertial
frames may result in a change of the total energy (relativistic energy) for
systems, and this quantity determines the relativistic mass.
The principle that the mass of a system of particles must be equal to the sum
of their rest_masses, even though true in classical physics, may be false in
special_relativity. The reason that rest masses cannot be simply added is that
this does not take into account other forms of energy, such as kinetic and
potential energy, and massless particles such as photons, all of which may (or
may not) affect the total mass of systems.
For moving massive particles in a system, examining the rest masses of the
various particles also amounts to introducing many different inertial
observation frames (which is prohibited if total system energy and momentum are
to be conserved), and also when in the rest frame of one particle, this
procedure ignores the momenta of other particles, which affect the system mass
if the other particles are in motion in this frame.
For the special type of mass called invariant_mass, changing the inertial frame
of observation for a whole closed system has no effect on the measure of
invariant mass of the system, which remains both conserved and invariant
(unchanging), even for different observers who view the entire system.
Invariant mass is a system combination of energy and momentum, which is
invariant for any observer, because in any inertial frame, the energies and
momenta of the various particles always add to the same quantity (the momentum
may be negative, so the addition amounts to a subtraction). The invariant mass
is the relativistic mass of the system when viewed in the center_of_momentum
frame. It is the minimum mass which a system may exhibit, as viewed from all
possible inertial frames.
The conservation of both relativistic and invariant mass applies even to
systems of particles created by pair_production, where energy for new particles
may come from kinetic energy of other particles, or from one or more photons as
part of a system that includes other particles besides a photon. Again, neither
the relativistic nor the invariant mass of totally closed (that is, isolated)
systems changes when new particles are created. However, different inertial
observers will disagree on the value of this conserved mass, if it is the
relativistic mass (i.e., relativistic mass is conserved but not invariant).
However, all observers agree on the value of the conserved mass if the mass
being measured is the invariant mass (i.e., invariant mass is both conserved
and invariant).
The mass-energy equivalence formula gives a different prediction in non-
isolated_systems, since if energy is allowed to escape a system, both
relativistic_mass and invariant_mass will escape also. In this case, the mass-
energy equivalence formula predicts that the change in mass of a system is
associated with the change in its energy due to energy being added or
subtracted:     &#x0394; m = &#x0394; E  /   c  2   .   {\displaystyle \Delta
m=\Delta E/c^{2}.}  [\Delta m = \Delta E/c^2.] This form involving changes was
the form in which this famous equation was originally presented by Einstein. In
this sense, mass changes in any system are explained simply if the mass of the
energy added or removed from the system, are taken into account.
The formula implies that bound systems have an invariant mass (rest mass for
the system) less than the sum of their parts, if the binding energy has been
allowed to escape the system after the system has been bound. This may happen
by converting system potential energy into some other kind of active energy,
such as kinetic energy or photons, which easily escape a bound system. The
difference in system masses, called a mass defect, is a measure of the binding
energy in bound systems â in other words, the energy needed to break the
system apart. The greater the mass defect, the larger the binding energy. The
binding energy (which itself has mass) must be released (as light or heat) when
the parts combine to form the bound system, and this is the reason the mass of
the bound system decreases when the energy leaves the system.[18] The total
invariant mass is actually conserved, when the mass of the binding energy that
has escaped, is taken into account.
**** General relativity[edit] ****
Main article: Mass_in_general_relativity
In general relativity, the total invariant_mass of photons in an expanding
volume of space will decrease, due to the red_shift of such an expansions. The
conservation of both mass and energy therefore depends on various corrections
made to energy in the theory, due to the changing gravitational_potential
energy of such systems.
