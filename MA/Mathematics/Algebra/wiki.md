For the kind of algebraic structure, see Algebra_over_a_field.
The quadratic_formula expresses the solution of the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0,
where a is not zero, in terms of its coefficients a, b and c.
Algebra (from Arabic "al-jabr", literally meaning "reunion of broken parts"[1])
is one of the broad_parts of mathematics, together with number_theory, geometry
and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical
symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols;[2] it is a unifying
thread of almost all of mathematics.[3] It includes everything from elementary
equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and
fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary_algebra; the more
abstract parts are called abstract_algebra or modern algebra. Elementary
algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics,
science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and
economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied
primarily by professional mathematicians.
Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as
using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take
on many values.[4] For example, in     x + 2 = 5   {\displaystyle x+2=5}
[x+2=5] the letter     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x] is unknown, but applying
additive_inverses can reveal its value:     x = 3   {\displaystyle x=3}  [x=3].
In E_=_mc2, the letters     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] and     m
{\displaystyle m}  [m] are variables, and the letter     c   {\displaystyle c}
[c] is a constant, the speed of light in a vacuum. Algebra gives methods for
writing formulas and solving equations that are much clearer and easier than
the older method of writing everything out in words.
The word algebra is also used in certain specialized ways. A special kind of
mathematical object in abstract algebra is called an "algebra", and the word is
used, for example, in the phrases linear_algebra and algebraic_topology.
A mathematician who does research in algebra is called an algebraist.

***** Etymology *****
The name of algebra comes from the title of a book by Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-
Khwarizmi[5]
The word algebra comes from the Arabic Ø§ÙØ¬Ø¨Ø± (al-jabr lit. "the reunion of
broken parts") from the title of the book Ilm_al-jabr_wa'l-muá¸³Äbala by the
Persian mathematician and astronomer al-Khwarizmi. The word entered the English
language during the fifteenth century, from either Spanish, Italian, or
Medieval_Latin. It originally referred to the surgical procedure of setting
broken or dislocated bones. The mathematical meaning was first recorded in the
sixteenth century.[6]
***** Different meanings of "algebra" *****
The word "algebra" has several related meanings in mathematics, as a single
word or with qualifiers.
    * As a single word without an article, "algebra" names a broad part of
      mathematics.
    * As a single word with an article or in plural, "an algebra" or "algebras"
      denotes a specific mathematical structure, whose precise definition
      depends on the author. Usually, the structure has an addition,
      multiplication, and a scalar multiplication (see Algebra_over_a_field).
      When some authors use the term "algebra", they make a subset of the
      following additional assumptions: associative, commutative, unital, and/
      or finite-dimensional. In universal_algebra, the word "algebra" refers to
      a generalization of the above concept, which allows for n-ary_operations.
    * With a qualifier, there is the same distinction:
          o Without an article, it means a part of algebra, such as linear
            algebra, elementary_algebra (the symbol-manipulation rules taught
            in elementary courses of mathematics as part of primary and
            secondary_education), or abstract_algebra (the study of the
            algebraic structures for themselves).
          o With an article, it means an instance of some abstract structure,
            like a Lie_algebra, an associative_algebra, or a vertex_operator
            algebra.
          o Sometimes both meanings exist for the same qualifier, as in the
            sentence: Commutative_algebra is the study of commutative_rings,
            which are commutative_algebras over the integers.
***** Algebra as a branch of mathematics *****
Algebra began with computations similar to those of arithmetic, with letters
standing for numbers.[4] This allowed proofs of properties that are true no
matter which numbers are involved. For example, in the quadratic_equation
         a  x  2   + b x + c = 0 ,   {\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0,}  [ax^
      {2}+bx+c=0,]
   a , b , c   {\displaystyle a,b,c}  [a,b,c] can be any numbers whatsoever
(except that     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] cannot be     0   {\displaystyle 0}
[{\displaystyle 0}]), and the quadratic_formula can be used to quickly and
easily find the values of the unknown quantity     x   {\displaystyle x}  [x]
which satisfy the equation. That is to say, to find all the solutions of the
equation.
Historically, and in current teaching, the study of algebra starts with the
solving of equations such as the quadratic_equation above. Then more general
questions, such as "does an equation have a solution?", "how many solutions
does an equation have?", "what can be said about the nature of the solutions?"
are considered. These questions led extending algebra to non-numerical objects,
such as permutations, vectors, matrices, and polynomials. The structural
properties of these non-numerical objects were then abstracted into algebraic
structures such as groups, rings, and fields.
Before the 16th century, mathematics was divided into only two subfields,
arithmetic and geometry. Even though some methods, which had been developed
much earlier, may be considered nowadays as algebra, the emergence of algebra
and, soon thereafter, of infinitesimal_calculus as subfields of mathematics
only dates from the 16th or 17th century. From the second half of 19th century
on, many new fields of mathematics appeared, most of which made use of both
arithmetic and geometry, and almost all of which used algebra.
Today, algebra has grown until it includes many branches of mathematics, as can
be seen in the Mathematics_Subject_Classification[7] where none of the first
level areas (two digit entries) is called algebra. Today algebra includes
section 08-General algebraic systems, 12-Field_theory and polynomials, 13-
Commutative_algebra, 15-Linear and multilinear_algebra; matrix_theory, 16-
Associative_rings_and_algebras, 17-Nonassociative_rings and algebras, 18-
Category_theory; homological_algebra, 19-K-theory and 20-Group_theory. Algebra
is also used extensively in 11-Number_theory and 14-Algebraic_geometry.

**** Early history of algebra ****
A page from Al-KhwÄrizmÄ«'s al-KitÄb_al-muá¸«taá¹£ar_fÄ«_á¸¥isÄb_al-Äabr
wa-l-muqÄbala
The roots of algebra can be traced to the ancient Babylonians,[8] who developed
an advanced arithmetical system with which they were able to do calculations in
an algorithmic fashion. The Babylonians developed formulas to calculate
solutions for problems typically solved today by using linear_equations,
quadratic_equations, and indeterminate_linear_equations. By contrast, most
Egyptians of this era, as well as Greek and Chinese_mathematics in the 1st
millennium BC, usually solved such equations by geometric methods, such as
those described in the Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus, Euclid's_Elements, and The
Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art. The geometric work of the Greeks,
typified in the Elements, provided the framework for generalizing formulae
beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating
and solving equations, although this would not be realized until mathematics
developed_in_medieval_Islam.[9]
By the time of Plato, Greek mathematics had undergone a drastic change. The
Greeks created a geometric_algebra where terms were represented by sides of
geometric objects, usually lines, that had letters associated with them.[4]
Diophantus (3rd century AD) was an Alexandrian Greek mathematician and the
author of a series of books called Arithmetica. These texts deal with solving
algebraic_equations,[10] and have led, in number_theory to the modern notion of
Diophantine_equation.
Earlier traditions discussed above had a direct influence on the Persian
mathematician Muá¸¥ammad ibn MÅ«sÄ al-KhwÄrizmÄ« (c. 780â850). He later
wrote The_Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing, which
established algebra as a mathematical discipline that is independent of
geometry and arithmetic.[11]
The Hellenistic mathematicians Hero_of_Alexandria and Diophantus[12] as well as
Indian_mathematicians such as Brahmagupta continued the traditions of Egypt and
Babylon, though Diophantus' Arithmetica and Brahmagupta's
BrÄhmasphuá¹­asiddhÄnta are on a higher level.[13][better source needed] For
example, the first complete arithmetic solution (including zero and negative
solutions) to quadratic equations was described by Brahmagupta in his book
Brahmasphutasiddhanta.[citation_needed] Later, Persian and Arabic
mathematicians developed algebraic methods to a much higher degree of
sophistication. Although Diophantus and the Babylonians used mostly special ad
hoc methods to solve equations, Al-Khwarizmi's contribution was fundamental. He
solved linear and quadratic equations without algebraic symbolism, negative
numbers or zero, thus he had to distinguish several types of equations.[14]
In the context where algebra is identified with the theory_of_equations, the
Greek mathematician Diophantus has traditionally been known as the "father of
algebra" and in context where it is identified with rules for manipulating and
solving equations, Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi is regarded as "the
father of algebra".[15][16][17][18][19][20] A debate now exists whether who (in
general sense) is more entitled to be known as "the father of algebra". Those
who support Diophantus point to the fact that the algebra found in Al-Jabr is
slightly more elementary than the algebra found in Arithmetica and that
Arithmetica is syncopated while Al-Jabr is fully rhetorical.[21] Those who
support Al-Khwarizmi point to the fact that he introduced the methods of
"reduction" and "balancing" (the transposition of subtracted terms to the other
side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like_terms on opposite sides
of the equation) which the term al-jabr originally referred to,[22] and that he
gave an exhaustive explanation of solving quadratic equations,[23] supported by
geometric proofs, while treating algebra as an independent discipline in its
own right.[18] His algebra was also no longer concerned "with a series of
problems to be resolved, but an exposition which starts with primitive terms in
which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which
henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study". He also studied
an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not
simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on
to define an infinite class of problems".[24]
Another Persian mathematician Omar_Khayyam is credited with identifying the
foundations of algebraic_geometry and found the general geometric solution of
the cubic_equation. His book Treatise on Demonstrations of Problems of Algebra
(1070), which laid down the principles of algebra, is part of the body of
Persian mathematics that was eventually transmitted to Europe.[25] Yet another
Persian mathematician, Sharaf_al-DÄ«n_al-TÅ«sÄ«, found algebraic and numerical
solutions to various cases of cubic equations.[26] He also developed the
concept of a function.[27] The Indian mathematicians Mahavira and Bhaskara_II,
the Persian mathematician Al-Karaji,[28] and the Chinese mathematician Zhu
Shijie, solved various cases of cubic, quartic, quintic and higher-order
polynomial equations using numerical methods. In the 13th century, the solution
of a cubic equation by Fibonacci is representative of the beginning of a
revival in European algebra. AbÅ«_al-á¸¤asan_ibn_Ê¿AlÄ«_al-Qalaá¹£ÄdÄ«
(1412â1486) took "the first steps toward the introduction of algebraic
symbolism". He also computed ân2, ân3 and used the method of successive
approximation to determine square roots.[29]
**** Modern history of algebra ****
Italian mathematician Girolamo_Cardano published the solutions to the cubic and
quartic_equations in his 1545 book Ars_magna.
FranÃ§ois_ViÃ¨te's work on new_algebra at the close of the 16th century was an
important step towards modern algebra. In 1637, RenÃ©_Descartes published La
GÃ©omÃ©trie, inventing analytic_geometry and introducing modern algebraic
notation. Another key event in the further development of algebra was the
general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the
mid-16th century. The idea of a determinant was developed by Japanese
mathematician Seki_KÅwa in the 17th century, followed independently by
Gottfried_Leibniz ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of
simultaneous linear equations using matrices. Gabriel_Cramer also did some work
on matrices and determinants in the 18th century. Permutations were studied by
Joseph-Louis_Lagrange in his 1770 paper RÃ©flexions sur la rÃ©solution
algÃ©brique des Ã©quations devoted to solutions of algebraic equations, in
which he introduced Lagrange_resolvents. Paolo_Ruffini was the first person to
develop the theory of permutation_groups, and like his predecessors, also in
the context of solving algebraic equations.
Abstract_algebra was developed in the 19th century, deriving from the interest
in solving equations, initially focusing on what is now called Galois_theory,
and on constructibility issues.[30] George_Peacock was the founder of axiomatic
thinking in arithmetic and algebra. Augustus_De_Morgan discovered relation
algebra in his Syllabus of a Proposed System of Logic. Josiah_Willard_Gibbs
developed an algebra of vectors in three-dimensional space, and Arthur_Cayley
developed an algebra of matrices (this is a noncommutative algebra).[31]
***** Areas of mathematics with the word algebra in their name *****
Some areas of mathematics that fall under the classification abstract algebra
have the word algebra in their name; linear_algebra is one example. Others do
not: group_theory, ring_theory, and field_theory are examples. In this section,
we list some areas of mathematics with the word "algebra" in the name.
    * Elementary_algebra, the part of algebra that is usually taught in
      elementary courses of mathematics.
    * Abstract_algebra, in which algebraic_structures such as groups, rings and
      fields are axiomatically defined and investigated.

***** Elementary algebra *****
Main article: Elementary_algebra
Algebraic expression notation:
  1 â power (exponent)
  2 â coefficient

  4 â operator
  5 â constant term
  x y c â variables/constants
Elementary algebra is the most basic form of algebra. It is taught to students
who are presumed to have no knowledge of mathematics beyond the basic
principles of arithmetic. In arithmetic, only numbers and their arithmetical
operations (such as +, â, Ã, Ã·) occur. In algebra, numbers are often
represented by symbols called variables (such as a, n, x, y or z). This is
useful because:
    * It allows the general formulation of arithmetical laws (such as a + b = b
      + a for all a and b), and thus is the first step to a systematic
      exploration of the properties of the real_number_system.
    * It allows the reference to "unknown" numbers, the formulation of
      equations and the study of how to solve these. (For instance, "Find a
      number x such that 3x + 1 = 10" or going a bit further "Find a number x
      such that ax + b = c". This step leads to the conclusion that it is not
      the nature of the specific numbers that allows us to solve it, but that
      of the operations involved.)
    * It allows the formulation of functional relationships. (For instance, "If
      you sell x tickets, then your profit will be 3x â 10 dollars, or f(x) =
      3x â 10, where f is the function, and x is the number to which the
      function is applied".)
**** Polynomials ****
The graph of a polynomial function of degree 3.
Main article: Polynomial
A polynomial is an expression that is the sum of a finite number of non-zero
terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of
variables raised to whole number powers. For example, x2 + 2x â 3 is a
polynomial in the single variable x. A polynomial expression is an expression
that may be rewritten as a polynomial, by using commutativity, associativity
and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example, (x â 1)(x +
3) is a polynomial expression, that, properly speaking, is not a polynomial. A
polynomial function is a function that is defined by a polynomial, or,
equivalently, by a polynomial expression. The two preceding examples define the
same polynomial function.
Two important and related problems in algebra are the factorization_of
polynomials, that is, expressing a given polynomial as a product of other
polynomials that can not be factored any further, and the computation of
polynomial_greatest_common_divisors. The example polynomial above can be
factored as (x â 1)(x + 3). A related class of problems is finding algebraic
expressions for the roots of a polynomial in a single variable.
**** Education ****
See also: Mathematics_education
It has been suggested that elementary algebra should be taught to students as
young as eleven years old,[32] though in recent years it is more common for
public lessons to begin at the eighth grade level (â 13 y.o. Â±) in the
United States.[33] However, in some US schools, algebra is started in ninth
grade.
***** Abstract algebra *****
Main articles: Abstract_algebra and Algebraic_structure
Abstract algebra extends the familiar concepts found in elementary algebra and
arithmetic of numbers to more general concepts. Here are listed fundamental
concepts in abstract algebra.
Sets: Rather than just considering the different types of numbers, abstract
algebra deals with the more general concept of sets: a collection of all
objects (called elements) selected by property specific for the set. All
collections of the familiar types of numbers are sets. Other examples of sets
include the set of all two-by-two matrices, the set of all second-degree
polynomials (ax2 + bx + c), the set of all two dimensional vectors in the
plane, and the various finite_groups such as the cyclic_groups, which are the
groups of integers modulo n. Set_theory is a branch of logic and not
technically a branch of algebra.
Binary_operations: The notion of addition (+) is abstracted to give a binary
operation, â say. The notion of binary operation is meaningless without the
set on which the operation is defined. For two elements a and b in a set S, a
â b is another element in the set; this condition is called closure. Addition
(+), subtraction (â), multiplication (Ã), and division (Ã·) can be binary
operations when defined on different sets, as are addition and multiplication
of matrices, vectors, and polynomials.
Identity_elements: The numbers zero and one are abstracted to give the notion
of an identity element for an operation. Zero is the identity element for
addition and one is the identity element for multiplication. For a general
binary operator â the identity element e must satisfy a â e = a and e â a
= a, and is necessarily unique, if it exists. This holds for addition as a + 0
= a and 0 + a = a and multiplication a Ã 1 = a and 1 Ã a = a. Not all sets
and operator combinations have an identity element; for example, the set of
positive natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) has no identity element for addition.
Inverse_elements: The negative numbers give rise to the concept of inverse
elements. For addition, the inverse of a is written âa, and for
multiplication the inverse is written aâ1. A general two-sided inverse
element aâ1 satisfies the property that a â aâ1 = e and aâ1 â a = e,
where e is the identity element.
Associativity: Addition of integers has a property called associativity. That
is, the grouping of the numbers to be added does not affect the sum. For
example: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4). In general, this becomes (a â b) â c =
a â (b â c). This property is shared by most binary operations, but not
subtraction or division or octonion_multiplication.
Commutativity: Addition and multiplication of real numbers are both
commutative. That is, the order of the numbers does not affect the result. For
example: 2 + 3 = 3 + 2. In general, this becomes a â b = b â a. This
property does not hold for all binary operations. For example, matrix
multiplication and quaternion_multiplication are both non-commutative.
**** Groups ****
Main article: Group_(mathematics)
See also: Group_theory and Examples_of_groups
Combining the above concepts gives one of the most important structures in
mathematics: a group. A group is a combination of a set S and a single binary
operation â, defined in any way you choose, but with the following
properties:
    * An identity element e exists, such that for every member a of S, e â a
      and a â e are both identical to a.
    * Every element has an inverse: for every member a of S, there exists a
      member aâ1 such that a â aâ1 and aâ1 â a are both identical to
      the identity element.
    * The operation is associative: if a, b and c are members of S, then (a â
      b) â c is identical to a â (b â c).
If a group is also commutative â that is, for any two members a and b of S, a
â b is identical to b â a â then the group is said to be abelian.
For example, the set of integers under the operation of addition is a group. In
this group, the identity element is 0 and the inverse of any element a is its
negation, âa. The associativity requirement is met, because for any integers
a, b and c, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
The non-zero rational_numbers form a group under multiplication. Here, the
identity element is 1, since 1 Ã a = a Ã 1 = a for any rational number a. The
inverse of a is 1/a, since a Ã 1/a = 1.
The integers under the multiplication operation, however, do not form a group.
This is because, in general, the multiplicative inverse of an integer is not an
integer. For example, 4 is an integer, but its multiplicative inverse is Â¼,
which is not an integer.
The theory of groups is studied in group_theory. A major result in this theory
is the classification_of_finite_simple_groups, mostly published between about
1955 and 1983, which separates the finite simple_groups into roughly 30 basic
types.
Semi-groups, quasi-groups, and monoids are structures similar to groups, but
more general. They comprise a set and a closed binary operation, but do not
necessarily satisfy the other conditions. A semi-group has an associative
binary operation, but might not have an identity element. A monoid is a semi-
group which does have an identity but might not have an inverse for every
element. A quasi-group satisfies a requirement that any element can be turned
into any other by either a unique left-multiplication or right-multiplication;
however the binary operation might not be associative.
All groups are monoids, and all monoids are semi-groups.

Groups just have one binary operation. To fully explain the behaviour of the
different types of numbers, structures with two operators need to be studied.
The most important of these are rings, and fields.
A ring has two binary operations (+) and (Ã), with Ã distributive over +.
Under the first operator (+) it forms an abelian group. Under the second
operator (Ã) it is associative, but it does not need to have identity, or
inverse, so division is not required. The additive (+) identity element is
written as 0 and the additive inverse of a is written as âa.
Distributivity generalises the distributive law for numbers. For the integers
(a + b) Ã c = a Ã c + b Ã c and c Ã (a + b) = c Ã a + c Ã b, and Ã is
said to be distributive over +.
The integers are an example of a ring. The integers have additional properties
which make it an integral_domain.
A field is a ring with the additional property that all the elements excluding
0 form an abelian group under Ã. The multiplicative (Ã) identity is written
as 1 and the multiplicative inverse of a is written as aâ1.
The rational numbers, the real numbers and the complex numbers are all examples
of fields.

  17. ^ See (Boyer_1991), page 181: "If we think primarily of matter of
      notations, Diophantus has good claim to be known as the 'father of
      algebra', but in terms of motivation and concept, the claim is less
      appropriate. The Arithmetica is not a systematic exposition of the
      algebraic operations, or of algebraic functions or of the solution of
      algebraic equations".
  18. ^ See (Boyer_1991), page 230: "The six cases of equations given above
      exhaust all possiblities for linear and quadratic equations...In this
      sense, then, al-Khwarizmi is entitled to be known as 'the father of
      algebra'".
  19. ^ See (Boyer_1991), page 228: "Diophantus sometimes is called the father
      of algebra, but this title more appropriately belongs to al-Khowarizmi".
  20. ^ a b See (Gandz_1936), page 263â277: "In a sense, al-Khwarizmi is more
      entitled to be called "the father of algebra" than Diophantus because al-
      Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its
      own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers".

      clarifications on Diophantus' method of solution". Historia_Mathematica.
      34 (3): 289â305. doi:10.1016/j.hm.2006.10.003. It is true that if one
      starts from a conception of algebra that emphasizes the solution of
      equations, as was generally the case with the Arab mathematicians from
      al-KhwÄrizmÄ« onward as well as with the Italian algebraists of the
      Renaissance, then the work of Diophantus appears indeed very different
      from the works of those algebraists

      is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word al-jabr
      presumably meant something like "restoration" or "completion" and seems
      to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an
      equation; the word muqabalah is said to refer to "reduction" or
      "balancing" â that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides
      of the equation".
  25. ^ See (Boyer_1991), The Arabic Hegemony, p. 230: "The six cases of
      equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic
