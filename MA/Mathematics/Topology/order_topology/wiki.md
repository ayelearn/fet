****** Order topology ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In mathematics, an order topology is a certain topology that can be defined on
any totally_ordered_set. It is a natural generalization of the topology of the
real_numbers to arbitrary totally ordered sets.
If X is a totally ordered set, the order topology on X is generated by the
subbase of "open rays"
         ( a , &#x221E; ) = { x &#x2223; a < x }   {\displaystyle (a,\infty )=\
      {x\mid a<x\}}  [(a,\infty )=\{x\mid a<x\}]
         ( &#x2212; &#x221E; , b ) = { x &#x2223; x < b }   {\displaystyle (-
      \infty ,b)=\{x\mid x<b\}}  [(-\infty ,b)=\{x\mid x<b\}]
for all a,b in X. This is equivalent to saying that the open intervals
         ( a , b ) = { x &#x2223; a < x < b }   {\displaystyle (a,b)=\{x\mid
      a<x<b\}}  [(a,b)=\{x\mid a<x<b\}]
together with the above rays form a base for the order topology. The open sets
in X are the sets that are a union of (possibly infinitely many) such open
intervals and rays.
A topological_space X is called orderable if there exists a total order on its
elements such that the order topology induced by that order and the given
topology on X coincide. The order topology makes X into a completely_normal
Hausdorff_space.
The standard topologies on R, Q, Z, and N are the order topologies.

***** Induced order topology[edit] *****
If Y is a subset of X, then Y inherits a total order from X. The set Y
therefore has an order topology, the induced order topology. As a subset of X,
Y also has a subspace_topology. The subspace topology is always at least as
fine as the induced order topology, but they are not in general the same.
For example, consider the subset Y = {â1} ∪ {1/n}n∈N in the rationals. Under
the subspace topology, the singleton set {â1} is open in Y, but under the
induced order topology, any open set containing â1 must contain all but
finitely many members of the space.
***** An example of a subspace of a linearly ordered space whose topology is
not an order topology[edit] *****
Though the subspace topology of Y = {â1} ∪ {1/n}n∈N in the section above is
shown to be not generated by the induced order on Y, it is nonetheless an order
topology on Y; indeed, in the subspace topology every point is isolated (i.e.,
singleton {y} is open in Y for every y in Y), so the subspace topology is the
discrete topology on Y (the topology in which every subset of Y is an open
set), and the discrete topology on any set is an order topology. To define a
total order on Y that generates the discrete topology on Y, simply modify the
induced order on Y by defining -1 to be the greatest element of Y and otherwise
keeping the same order for the other points, so that in this new order (call it
say <1) we have 1/n <1 â1 for all n∈N. Then, in the order topology on Y
generated by <1, every point of Y is isolated in Y.
We wish to define here a subset Z of a linearly ordered topological space X
such that no total order on Z generates the subspace topology on Z, so that the
subspace topology will not be an order topology even though it is the subspace
topology of a space whose topology is an order topology.
Let     Z = { &#x2212; 1 } &#x222A; ( 0 , 1 )   {\displaystyle Z=\{-1\}\cup
(0,1)}  [Z=\{-1\}\cup (0,1)] in the real line. The same argument as before
shows that the subspace topology on Z is not equal to the induced order
topology on Z, but one can show that the subspace topology on Z cannot be equal
to any order topology on Z.
An argument follows. Suppose by way of contradiction that there is some strict
total_order < on Z such that the order topology generated by < is equal to the
subspace topology on Z (note that we are not assuming that < is the induced
order on Z, but rather an arbitrarily given total order on Z that generates the
subspace topology). In the following, interval notation should be interpreted
relative to the < relation. Also, if A and B are sets,     A < B
{\displaystyle A<B}  [{\displaystyle A<B}]shall mean that     a < b
{\displaystyle a<b}  [{\displaystyle a<b}] for each a in A and b in B.
Let M=Z\{-1}, the unit interval. M is connected. If m,n ∈ M and m<-1<n, then
( &#x2212; &#x221E; , &#x2212; 1 )   {\displaystyle (-\infty ,-1)}  [(-\infty
,-1)] and     ( &#x2212; 1 , &#x221E; )   {\displaystyle (-1,\infty )}  [(-
1,\infty )] separate M, a contradiction. Thus, M<{-1} or {-1}<M. Assume without
loss of generality that {-1}<M. Since {-1} is open in Z, there is some point p
in M such that the interval (-1,p) is empty. Since {-1}<M, -1 is the only
element of Z that is less than p, so p is the minimum of M. Then M\{p} = A ∪ B,
where A and B are nonempty open and disjoint connected subsets of M (removing a
point from an open interval yields two open intervals). By connectedness, no
point of Z\B can lie between two points of B, and no point of Z\A can lie
between two points of A. Therefore, either A < B or B < A. Assume without loss
of generality that A < B. If a is any point in A, then p < a and (p,a)
&#x2286;   {\displaystyle \subseteq }  [\subseteq ] A. Then (-1,a)=[p,a), so
[p,a) is open. {p}∪A=[p,a)∪A, so {p}∪A is an open subset of M and hence M = (
{p}∪A) ∪ B is the union of two disjoint open subsets of M so M is not
connected, a contradiction.
***** Left and right order topologies[edit] *****
Several variants of the order topology can be given:
    * The right order topology on X is the topology whose open sets consist of
      intervals of the form (a, ∞) (including (-∞, ∞)).[1]
    * The left order topology on X is the topology whose open sets consist of
      intervals of the form (−∞, b) (including (-∞, ∞)).
The left and right order topologies can be used to give counterexamples in
general topology. For example, the left or right order topology on a bounded
set provides an example of a compact_space that is not Hausdorff.
The left order topology is the standard topology used for many set-theoretic
purposes on a Boolean_algebra.
***** Ordinal space[edit] *****
For any ordinal_number λ one can consider the spaces of ordinal numbers
         [ 0 , &#x03BB; ) = { &#x03B1; &#x2223; &#x03B1; < &#x03BB; }
      {\displaystyle [0,\lambda )=\{\alpha \mid \alpha <\lambda \}}  [
      {\displaystyle [0,\lambda )=\{\alpha \mid \alpha <\lambda \}}]
         [ 0 , &#x03BB; ] = { &#x03B1; &#x2223; &#x03B1; &#x2264; &#x03BB; }
      {\displaystyle [0,\lambda ]=\{\alpha \mid \alpha \leq \lambda \}}  [
      {\displaystyle [0,\lambda ]=\{\alpha \mid \alpha \leq \lambda \}}]
together with the natural order topology. These spaces are called ordinal
spaces. (Note that in the usual set-theoretic construction of ordinal numbers
we have λ = [0,λ) and λ + 1 = [0,λ]). Obviously, these spaces are mostly of
interest when λ is an infinite ordinal; otherwise (for finite ordinals), the
order topology is simply the discrete_topology.
When λ = ω (the first infinite ordinal), the space [0,ω) is just N with the
usual (still discrete) topology, while [0,ω] is the one-point_compactification
of N.
Of particular interest is the case when λ = ω1, the set of all countable
ordinals, and the first_uncountable_ordinal. The element ω1 is a limit_point of
the subset [0,ω1) even though no sequence of elements in [0,ω1) has the element
ω1 as its limit. In particular, [0,ω1] is not first-countable. The subspace
[0,ω1) is first-countable however, since the only point without a countable
local_base is ω1. Some further properties include
    * neither [0,ω1) or [0,ω1] is separable or second-countable
    * [0,ω1] is compact while [0,ω1) is sequentially_compact and countably
      compact, but not compact or paracompact
***** Topology and ordinals[edit] *****
**** Ordinals as topological spaces[edit] ****
Any ordinal_number can be made into a topological_space by endowing it with the
order topology (since, being well-ordered, an ordinal is in particular totally
ordered): in the absence of indication to the contrary, it is always that order
topology that is meant when an ordinal is thought of as a topological space.
(Note that if we are willing to accept a proper class as a topological space,
then the class of all ordinals is also a topological space for the order
topology.)
The set of limit_points of an ordinal Î± is precisely the set of limit_ordinals
less than Î±. Successor ordinals (and zero) less than Î± are isolated_points in
Î±. In particular, the finite ordinals and Ï are discrete topological spaces,
and no ordinal beyond that is discrete. The ordinal Î± is compact as a
topological space if and only if Î± is a successor_ordinal.
The closed sets of a limit ordinal Î± are just the closed sets in the sense
that we have already_defined, namely, those that contain a limit ordinal
whenever they contain all sufficiently large ordinals below it.
Any ordinal is, of course, an open subset of any further ordinal. We can also
define the topology on the ordinals in the following inductive way: 0 is the
empty topological space, Î±+1 is obtained by taking the one-point
compactification of Î±, and for Î´ a limit ordinal, Î´ is equipped with the
inductive_limit topology. Note that if Î± is a successor ordinal, then Î± is
compact, in which case its one-point compactification Î±+1 is the disjoint
union of Î± and a point.
As topological spaces, all the ordinals are Hausdorff and even normal. They are
also totally_disconnected (connected components are points), scattered (every
non-empty set has an isolated point; in this case, just take the smallest
element), zero-dimensional (the topology has a clopen basis: here, write an
open interval (Î²,Î³) as the union of the clopen intervals (Î²,Î³'+1)=
[Î²+1,Î³'] for Î³'<Î³). However, they are not extremally_disconnected in
general (there are open sets, for example the even numbers from Ï, whose
closure is not open).
The topological spaces Ï1 and its successor Ï1+1 are frequently used as text-
book examples of non-countable topological spaces. For example, in the
topological space Ï1+1, the element Ï1 is in the closure of the subset Ï1
even though no sequence of elements in Ï1 has the element Ï1 as its limit: an
element in Ï1 is a countable set; for any sequence of such sets, the union of
these sets is the union of countably many countable sets, so still countable;
this union is an upper bound of the elements of the sequence, and therefore of
the limit of the sequence, if it has one.
The space Ï1 is first-countable, but not second-countable, and Ï1+1 has
neither of these two properties, despite being compact. It is also worthy of
note that any continuous function from Ï1 to R (the real_line) is eventually
constant: so the Stone-Äech_compactification of Ï1 is Ï1+1, just as its one-
point compactification (in sharp contrast to Ï, whose Stone-Äech
compactification is much larger than Ï).
**** Ordinal-indexed sequences[edit] ****
If Î± is a limit ordinal and X is a set, an Î±-indexed sequence of elements of
X merely means a function from Î± to X. This concept, a transfinite sequence or
ordinal-indexed sequence, is a generalization of the concept of a sequence. An
ordinary sequence corresponds to the case Î± = Ï.
If X is a topological space, we say that an Î±-indexed sequence of elements of
X converges to a limit x when it converges as a net, in other words, when given
any neighborhood U of x there is an ordinal Î²<Î± such that xÎ¹ is in U for all
Î¹â¥Î².
Ordinal-indexed sequences are more powerful than ordinary (Ï-indexed)
sequences to determine limits in topology: for example, Ï1 (omega-one, the set
of all countable ordinal numbers, and the smallest uncountable ordinal number),
is a limit point of Ï1+1 (because it is a limit ordinal), and, indeed, it is
the limit of the Ï1-indexed sequence which maps any ordinal less than Ï1 to
itself: however, it is not the limit of any ordinary (Ï-indexed) sequence in
Ï1, since any such limit is less than or equal to the union of its elements,
which is a countable union of countable sets, hence itself countable.
However, ordinal-indexed sequences are not powerful enough to replace nets (or
filters) in general: for example, on the Tychonoff_plank (the product space
(  &#x03C9;  1   + 1 ) &#x00D7; ( &#x03C9; + 1 )   {\displaystyle (\omega _
{1}+1)\times (\omega +1)}  [(\omega _{1}+1)\times (\omega +1)]), the corner
point     (  &#x03C9;  1   , &#x03C9; )   {\displaystyle (\omega _{1},\omega )}
[(\omega _{1},\omega )] is a limit point (it is in the closure) of the open
subset      &#x03C9;  1   &#x00D7; &#x03C9;   {\displaystyle \omega _{1}\times
\omega }  [\omega _{1}\times \omega ], but it is not the limit of an ordinal-
indexed sequence.
