In thermodynamics, the internal energy of a system is the total energy
contained within the system. It is the energy necessary to create or prepare
the system in any given state, but does not include the kinetic_energy of
motion of the system as a whole, nor the potential energy of the system as a
whole due to external force fields which includes the energy of displacement of
the system's surroundings. It keeps account of the gains and losses of energy
of the system that are due to changes in its internal state.[1][2]
The internal energy of a system can be increased by introduction of matter, by
heat, or by doing thermodynamic_work on the system.[3] When matter transfer is
prevented by impermeable containing walls, the system is said to be closed and
the first_law_of_thermodynamics may be regarded as defining the internal energy
as the algebraic sum of the "heat added to" and "work done by" the system on
its surroundings. If the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy, the
system is said to be isolated and its internal energy cannot change.
The internal energy of a given state of a system cannot be directly measured
and knowledge of all components is rarely interesting. Thermodynamics is
chiefly concerned only with changes in the internal energy, not with its
absolute value. Changes, relative to a reference state, are determined from
convenient chains of thermodynamic_operations and thermodynamic_processes by
which a given state can be prepared. Such a process can be described by certain
extensive state variables of the system, for example, entropy, mole numbers, or
electric_dipole_moment. For practical considerations in thermodynamics and
engineering it is rarely necessary or convenient to consider all energies
belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a system, such as the energy given
by the equivalence of mass. Customarily, thermodynamic descriptions include
only items relevant to the processes under study.
The internal energy is one of the two cardinal state_functions of the state
variables, and its value depends only on the current state of the system and
not on the processes undergone to prepare it. It is an extensive_quantity. It
is the one and only cardinal thermodynamic_potential.[4] All other
thermodynamic potentials are formulated from the internal energy. In practical
considerations in thermodynamics it is rarely necessary, nor convenient, to
consider all intrinsic energies of a system, such as the energy given by the
mass-energy_equivalence. Conveniently, it can be explained in microscopic terms
by the random kinetic energy due to the microscopic motion of the system's
particles from translations, rotations, and vibrations, and by the potential
energy associated with microscopic forces, including chemical_bonds. In
statistical_mechanics, internal energy is the ensemble_average of the sum of
the microscopic kinetic and potential energies of the system. For study of
thermonuclear reactions, the static rest mass energy of the constituents of
matter are important.
The unit of energy in the International_System_of_Units (SI) is the joule (J).
Sometimes it is convenient to use a corresponding intensive energy density,
called specific internal energy, which is either relative to the mass of the
system, with the unit J/kg, or relative to the amount_of_substance with unit J/
mol (molar internal energy).

***** Cardinal functions[edit] *****
The internal energy, U(S,V,{Nj}), expresses the thermodynamics of a system in
the energy-language, or in the energy representation. As a function_of_state,
its arguments are exclusively extensive variables of state. Alongside the
internal energy, the other cardinal function of state of a thermodynamic system
is its entropy, as a function, S(U,V,{Nj}), of the same list of extensive
variables of state, except that the entropy, S, is replaced in the list by the
internal energy, U. It expresses the entropy representation.[4][5][6]
Each cardinal function is a monotonic function of each of its natural or
canonical variables. Each provides its characteristic or fundamental equation,
for example U = U(S,V,{Nj}), that by itself contains all thermodynamic
information about the system. The fundamental equations for the two cardinal
functions can in principle be interconverted by solving, for example, U = U
(S,V,{Nj}) for S, to get S = S(U,V,{Nj}).
In contrast, Legendre transforms are necessary to derive fundamental equations
for other thermodynamic potentials and Massieu_functions. The entropy as a
function only of extensive state variables is the one and only cardinal
function of state for the generation of Massieu functions. It is not itself
customarily designated a 'Massieu function', though rationally it might be
thought of as such, corresponding to the term 'thermodynamic potential', which
includes the internal energy.[5][7][8]
For real and practical systems, explicit expressions of the fundamental
equations are almost always unavailable, but the functional relations exist in
principle. Formal, in principle, manipulations of them are valuable for the
understanding of thermodynamics.
***** Description and definition[edit] *****
The internal energy U of a given state of the system is determined relative to
that of a standard state of the system, by adding up the macroscopic transfers
of energy that accompany a change of state from the reference state to the
given state:
         &#x0394; U =  &#x2211;  i    E  i      {\displaystyle \Delta U=\sum _
      {i}E_{i}\,}  [\Delta U = \sum_i  E_i\,]
where ÎU denotes the difference between the internal energy of the given state
and that of the reference state, and the Ei are the various energies
transferred to the system in the steps from the reference state to the given
state. It is the energy needed to create the given state of the system from the
reference state.
From a non-relativistic microscopic point of view, it may be divided into
microscopic potential energy, Umicro pot, and microscopic kinetic energy,
Umicro kin, components:
         U =  U   m i c r o  p o t    +  U   m i c r o  k i n
      {\displaystyle U=U_{\mathrm {micro\,pot} }+U_{\mathrm {micro\,kin} }}  [U
      = U_{\mathrm{micro\,pot}} + U_{\mathrm{micro\,kin}}]
The microscopic kinetic energy of a system arises as the sum of the motions of
all the system's particles with respect to the center-of-mass frame, whether it
be the motion of atoms, molecules, atomic nuclei, electrons, or other
particles. The microscopic potential energy algebraic summative components are
those of the chemical and nuclear particle bonds, and the physical force fields
within the system, such as due to internal induced electric or magnetic dipole
moment, as well as the energy of deformation of solids (stress-strain).
Usually, the split into microscopic kinetic and potential energies is outside
the scope of macroscopic thermodynamics.
Internal energy does not include the energy due to motion or location of a
system as a whole. That is to say, it excludes any kinetic or potential energy
the body may have because of its motion or location in external gravitational,
electrostatic, or electromagnetic fields. It does, however, include the
contribution of such a field to the energy due to the coupling of the internal
degrees of freedom of the object with the field. In such a case, the field is
included in the thermodynamic description of the object in the form of an
additional external parameter.
For practical considerations in thermodynamics or engineering, it is rarely
necessary, convenient, nor even possible, to consider all energies belonging to
the total intrinsic energy of a sample system, such as the energy given by the
equivalence of mass. Typically, descriptions only include components relevant
to the system under study. Indeed, in most systems under consideration,
especially through thermodynamics, it is impossible to calculate the total
internal energy.[9] Therefore, a convenient null reference point may be chosen
for the internal energy.
The internal energy is an extensive_property: it depends on the size of the
system, or on the amount_of_substance it contains.
At any temperature greater than absolute_zero, microscopic potential energy and
kinetic energy are constantly converted into one another, but the sum remains
constant in an isolated_system (cf. table). In the classical picture of
thermodynamics, kinetic energy vanishes at zero temperature and the internal
energy is purely potential energy. However, quantum mechanics has demonstrated
that even at zero temperature particles maintain a residual energy of motion,
the zero_point_energy. A system at absolute zero is merely in its quantum-
mechanical ground state, the lowest energy state available. At absolute zero a
system of given composition has attained its minimum attainable entropy.
The microscopic kinetic energy portion of the internal energy gives rise to the
temperature of the system. Statistical_mechanics relates the pseudo-random
kinetic energy of individual particles to the mean kinetic energy of the entire
ensemble of particles comprising a system. Furthermore, it relates the mean
microscopic kinetic energy to the macroscopically observed empirical property
that is expressed as temperature of the system. This energy is often referred
to as the thermal energy of a system,[10] relating this energy, like the
temperature, to the human experience of hot and cold.
Statistical mechanics considers any system to be statistically distributed
across an ensemble of N microstates. Each microstate has an energy Ei and is
associated with a probability pi. The internal energy is the mean value of the
system's total energy, i.e., the sum of all microstate energies, each weighted
by their probability of occurrence:
         U =  &#x2211;  i = 1   N    p  i     E  i   &#xA0; .   {\displaystyle
      U=\sum _{i=1}^{N}p_{i}\,E_{i}\ .}  [U = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i \,E_i\ .]
This is the statistical expression of the first_law_of_thermodynamics.

Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with the changes, ÎU, in internal
energy.
For a closed system, with matter transfer excluded, the changes in internal
energy are due to heat transfer Q and due to work. The latter can be split into
two kinds, pressure-volume work Wpressure-volume, and frictional and other
kinds, such as electrical_polarization, which do not alter the volume of the
system, and are called isochoric, Wisochoric. Accordingly, the internal energy
change ÎU for a process may be written[3]
         &#x0394; U = Q +  W   p r e s s u r e &#x2212; v o l u m e    +  W   i
      s o c h o r i c                                          ( c l o s e d
      s y s t e m ,   n o   t r a n s f e r   o f   m a t t e r )  .
      {\displaystyle \Delta U=Q+W_{\mathrm {pressure-volume} }+W_{\mathrm
      {isochoric}
      }\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm
      {(closed\,\,system,\,\,no\,\,transfer\,\,of\,\,matter)} .}  [ \Delta U =
      Q + W_{\mathrm{pressure-volume}} + W_{\mathrm
      {isochoric}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm
      {(closed\,\,system,\,\,no\,\,transfer\,\,of\,\,matter)}.][note_1]
When a closed system receives energy as heat, this energy increases the
internal energy. It is distributed between microscopic kinetic and microscopic
potential energies. In general, thermodynamics does not trace this
distribution. In an ideal gas all of the extra energy results in a temperature
increase, as it is stored solely as microscopic kinetic energy; such heating is
said to be sensible.
A second mechanism of change of internal energy of a closed system is the doing
of work on the system, either in mechanical form by changing pressure or
volume, or by other perturbations, such as directing an electric current
through the system.
If the system is not closed, the third mechanism that can increase the internal
energy is transfer of matter into the system. This increase, ÎUmatter cannot
be split into heat and work components. If the system is so set up physically
that heat and work can be done on it by pathways separate from and independent
of matter transfer, then the transfers of energy add to change the internal
energy:
         &#x0394; U = Q +  W   p r e s s u r e &#x2212; v o l u m e    +  W   i

      {\mathrm {matter} }}  [ \Delta U = Q + W_{\mathrm{pressure-volume}} + W_
      {\mathrm{isochoric}} + \Delta U_{\mathrm{matter}}]
          ( s e p a r a t e   p a t h w a y   f o r   m a t t e r   t r a n s f
      e r   f r o m   h e a t   a n d   w o r k   t r a n s f e r   p a t h w a

      .}  [\mathrm{
      (separate\,\,pathway\,\,for\,\,matter\,\,transfer\,\,from\,\,heat\,\,and\,\,work\,\,transfer\,\,pathways)}.]
If a system undergoes certain phase transformations while being heated, such as
melting and vaporization, it may be observed that the temperature of the system
does not change until the entire sample has completed the transformation. The
energy introduced into the system while the temperature did not change is
called a latent energy, or latent_heat, in contrast to sensible heat, which is
associated with temperature change.
***** Internal energy of the ideal gas[edit] *****
Thermodynamics often uses the concept of the ideal_gas for teaching purposes,
and as an approximation for working systems. The ideal gas is a gas of
particles considered as point objects that interact only by elastic collisions
and fill a volume such that their free mean path between collisions is much
larger than their diameter. Such systems approximate the monatomic gases,
helium and the other noble_gases. Here the kinetic energy consists only of the
translational energy of the individual atoms. Monatomic particles do not rotate
or vibrate, and are not electronically_excited to higher energies except at
very high temperatures.
Therefore, internal energy changes in an ideal gas may be described solely by
changes in its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the internal energy of
the perfect gas and depends entirely on its pressure, volume and thermodynamic
temperature.
The internal energy of an ideal gas is proportional to its mass (number of
moles) n and to its temperature T
         U = c n T ,   {\displaystyle U=cnT,}  [{\displaystyle U=cnT,}]
where c is the heat capacity (at constant volume) of the gas. The internal
energy may be written as a function of the three extensive properties S, V, n
(entropy, volume, mass) in the following way [11][12]
         U ( S , V , n ) =  c o n s t  &#x22C5;  e   S  c n      V    &#x2212;
      R  c     n    R + c  c    ,   {\displaystyle U(S,V,n)=\mathrm {const}
      \cdot e^{\frac {S}{cn}}V^{\frac {-R}{c}}n^{\frac {R+c}{c}},}  [
      {\displaystyle U(S,V,n)=\mathrm {const} \cdot e^{\frac {S}{cn}}V^{\frac
      {-R}{c}}n^{\frac {R+c}{c}},}]
where const is an arbitrary positive constant and where R is the universal_gas
constant. It is easily seen that U is a linearly homogeneous_function of the
three variables (that is, it is extensive in these variables), and that it is
weakly convex. Knowing temperature and pressure to be the derivatives     T =
&#x2202; U   &#x2202; S    ,   {\displaystyle T={\frac {\partial U}{\partial
S}},}  [T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S},]     p = &#x2212;    &#x2202; U
&#x2202; V    ,   {\displaystyle p=-{\frac {\partial U}{\partial V}},}  [p = -
\frac{\partial U}{\partial V},] the ideal_gas_law     p V = n R T
{\displaystyle pV=nRT}  [pV=nRT] immediately follows.

The above summation of all components of change in internal energy assumes that
a positive energy denotes heat added to the system or work done on the system,
while a negative energy denotes work of the system on the environment.
Typically this relationship is expressed in infinitesimal terms using the
differentials of each term. Only the internal energy is an exact_differential.
For a system undergoing only thermodynamics processes, i.e. a closed system
that can exchange only heat and work, the change in the internal energy is
         d U = &#x03B4; Q + &#x03B4; W    {\displaystyle dU=\delta Q+\delta
      W\,}  [ d U = \delta Q + \delta W \, ]
which constitutes the first_law_of_thermodynamics.[note_1] It may be expressed
in terms of other thermodynamic parameters. Each term is composed of an
intensive_variable (a generalized force) and its conjugate infinitesimal
extensive_variable (a generalized displacement).
For example, for a non-viscous fluid, the mechanical work done on the system
may be related to the pressure p and volume V. The pressure is the intensive
generalized force, while the volume is the extensive generalized displacement:
         &#x03B4; W = &#x2212; p  d  V    {\displaystyle \delta W=-p\mathrm {d}
      V\,}  [\delta W = - p \mathrm{d}V\,].
This defines the direction of work, W, to be energy flow from the working
system to the surroundings, indicated by a negative term.[note_1] Taking the
direction of heat transfer Q to be into the working fluid and assuming a
reversible_process, the heat is
         &#x03B4; Q = T  d  S    {\displaystyle \delta Q=T\mathrm {d} S\,}
      [\delta Q = T \mathrm{d}S\,].
               T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] is temperature
               S   {\displaystyle S}  [S] is entropy
and the change in internal energy becomes
          d  U = T  d  S &#x2212; p  d  V    {\displaystyle \mathrm {d}
      U=T\mathrm {d} S-p\mathrm {d} V\!}  [\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S-p\mathrm
      {d}V \!]
**** Changes due to temperature and volume[edit] ****
The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature
and volume is
         d U =  C  V   d T +  [  T   (    &#x2202; p   &#x2202; T    )   V
      &#x2212; p  ]  d V    &#xA0;(1)  .    {\displaystyle dU=C_{V}dT+\left
      [T\left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}-p\right]dV\,\,{\text
      { (1)}}.\,}  [dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial
      T}\right)_{V}  - p\right]dV\,\,\text{   (1)}.\,]
This is useful if the equation_of_state is known.
In case of an ideal gas, we can derive that     d U =  C  V   d T
{\displaystyle dU=C_{V}dT}  [{\displaystyle dU=C_{V}dT}], i.e. the internal
energy of an ideal gas can be written as a function that depends only on the
temperature.
Proof of pressure independence for an ideal gas
The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature
and volume is
         d U =  C  V   d T +  [  T   (    &#x2202; p   &#x2202; T    )   V
      &#x2212; p  ]  d V .    {\displaystyle dU=C_{V}dT+\left[T\left({\frac
      {\partial p}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}-p\right]dV.\,}  [dU =C_{V}dT +\left
      [T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - p\right]dV.\,]
The equation of state is the ideal gas law
         p V = n R T .    {\displaystyle pV=nRT.\,}  [p V = n R T.\,]
Solve for pressure:
         p =    n R T  V   .   {\displaystyle p={\frac {nRT}{V}}.}  [p = \frac
      {n R T}{V}.]
Substitute in to internal energy expression:
         d U =  C  V   d T +  [  T   (    &#x2202; p   &#x2202; T    )   V
      &#x2212;    n R T  V    ]  d V .    {\displaystyle dU=C_{V}dT+\left
      [T\left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}-{\frac {nRT}
      {V}}\right]dV.\,}  [dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial
      T}\right)_{V}  - \frac{n R T}{V}\right]dV.\,]
Take the derivative of pressure with respect to temperature:
           (    &#x2202; p   &#x2202; T    )   V   =    n R  V   .
      {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}={\frac
      {nR}{V}}.}  [\left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial T} \right)_{V} = \frac{n
      R}{V}.]
Replace:
         d U =  C  V   d T +  [     n R T  V   &#x2212;    n R T  V    ]  d V .
      {\displaystyle dU=C_{V}dT+\left[{\frac {nRT}{V}}-{\frac {nRT}
      {V}}\right]dV.}  [dU = C_{V}dT + \left[ \frac{n R T}{V}  - \frac{n R T}
      {V} \right] dV.]
And simplify:
         d U =  C  V   d T .    {\displaystyle dU=C_{V}dT.\,}  [dU =C_{V}dT.\,]
Derivation of dU in terms of dT and dV
To express dU in terms of dT and dV, the term
         d S =   (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; T    )   V   d T +   (    &#x2202;
      S   &#x2202; V    )   T   d V    {\displaystyle dS=\left({\frac {\partial
      S}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}dT+\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial
      V}}\right)_{T}dV\,}  [dS = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_
      {V}dT + \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T}dV \,]
is substituted in the fundamental_thermodynamic_relation
         d U = T d S &#x2212; p d V .    {\displaystyle dU=TdS-pdV.\,}  [dU = T
      dS - p dV.\,]
This gives:
         d U = T   (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; T    )   V   d T +  [  T
      (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; V    )   T   &#x2212; p  ]  d V .
      {\displaystyle dU=T\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial T}}\right)_
      {V}dT+\left[T\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial V}}\right)_{T}-
      p\right]dV.\,}  [dU = T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}dT
      +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} - p\right]dV.\,]
The term     T   (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; T    )   V     {\displaystyle
T\left({\frac {\partial S}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}}  [T\left(\frac{\partial S}
{\partial T}\right)_{V}] is the heat_capacity_at_constant_volume      C  V   .
{\displaystyle C_{V}.}  [C_{V}.]
The partial derivative of S with respect to V can be evaluated if the equation
of state is known. From the fundamental thermodynamic relation, it follows that
the differential of the Helmholtz_free_energy A is given by:
         d A = &#x2212; S d T &#x2212; p d V .    {\displaystyle dA=-SdT-
      pdV.\,}  [dA = -S dT - p dV.\,]
The symmetry_of_second_derivatives of A with respect to T and V yields the
Maxwell_relation:
           (    &#x2202; S   &#x2202; V    )   T   =   (    &#x2202; p
      &#x2202; T    )   V   .    {\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial S}
      {\partial V}}\right)_{T}=\left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial T}}\right)_
      {V}.\,}  [\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} = \left(\frac
      {\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}.\,]
This gives the expression above.
**** Changes due to temperature and pressure[edit] ****
When dealing with fluids or solids, an expression in terms of the temperature
and pressure is usually more useful:
         d U =  (   C  p   &#x2212; &#x03B1; p V  )  d T +  (   &#x03B2;  T   p
      &#x2212; &#x03B1; T  )  V d p    {\displaystyle dU=\left(C_{p}-\alpha
      pV\right)dT+\left(\beta _{T}p-\alpha T\right)Vdp\,}  [dU = \left(C_{p}-
      \alpha p V\right)dT +\left(\beta_{T}p-\alpha T\right)Vdp\,]
where it is assumed that the heat capacity at constant pressure is related to
the heat capacity at constant volume according to:
          C  p   =  C  V   + V T    &#x03B1;  2    &#x03B2;  T
      {\displaystyle C_{p}=C_{V}+VT{\frac {\alpha ^{2}}{\beta _{T}}}\,}  [C_{p}
      = C_{V} + V T\frac{\alpha^{2}}{\beta_{T}}\,]
Derivation of dU in terms of dT and dP
The partial derivative of the pressure with respect to temperature at constant
volume can be expressed in terms of the coefficient_of_thermal_expansion
         &#x03B1; &#x2261;   1 V     (    &#x2202; V   &#x2202; T    )   p
      {\displaystyle \alpha \equiv {\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}
      {\partial T}}\right)_{p}\,}  [\alpha \equiv \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac
      {\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}\,]
and the isothermal compressibility
          &#x03B2;  T   &#x2261; &#x2212;   1 V     (    &#x2202; V   &#x2202;
      p    )   T      {\displaystyle \beta _{T}\equiv -{\frac {1}{V}}\left(
      {\frac {\partial V}{\partial p}}\right)_{T}\,}  [\beta_{T} \equiv -\frac
      {1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}\,]
by writing:
         d V =   (    &#x2202; V   &#x2202; p    )   T   d p +   (    &#x2202;
      V   &#x2202; T    )   p   d T = V  (  &#x03B1; d T &#x2212;  &#x03B2;  T
      d p  )     &#xA0;(2)     {\displaystyle dV=\left({\frac {\partial V}
      {\partial p}}\right)_{T}dp+\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial T}}\right)_
      {p}dT=V\left(\alpha dT-\beta _{T}dp\right)\,\,{\text{ (2)}}\,}  [dV =
      \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}dp + \left(\frac{\partial
      V}{\partial T}\right)_{p} dT = V\left(\alpha dT-\beta_{T}dp
      \right)\,\,\text{  (2)} \,]
and equating dV to zero and solving for the ratio dp/dT. This gives:
           (    &#x2202; p   &#x2202; T    )   V   = &#x2212;     (    &#x2202;
      V   &#x2202; T    )   p     (    &#x2202; V   &#x2202; p    )   T     =
      &#x03B1;  &#x03B2;  T        &#xA0;(3)     {\displaystyle \left({\frac
      {\partial p}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}=-{\frac {\left({\frac {\partial V}
      {\partial T}}\right)_{p}}{\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial p}}\right)_
      {T}}}={\frac {\alpha }{\beta _{T}}}\,\,{\text{ (3)}}\,}  [\left(\frac
      {\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}= -\frac{\left(\frac{\partial V}
      {\partial T}\right)_{p}}{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}}=
      \frac{\alpha}{\beta_{T}}\,\,\text{   (3)}\,]
Substituting (2) and (3) in (1) gives the above expression.
**** Changes due to volume at constant temperature[edit] ****
The internal_pressure is defined as a partial_derivative of the internal energy
with respect to the volume at constant temperature:
          &#x03C0;  T   =   (    &#x2202; U   &#x2202; V    )   T
      {\displaystyle \pi _{T}=\left({\frac {\partial U}{\partial V}}\right)_
      {T}}  [ \pi _T  = \left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T  ]
**** Consistency with statistical definition[edit] ****
Differentiating, we have:
   d U =  &#x2211;  i    E  i   d  p  i   +  &#x2211;  i    p  i   d  E  i
{\displaystyle dU=\sum _{i}E_{i}dp_{i}+\sum _{i}p_{i}dE_{i}}  [{\displaystyle
dU=\sum _{i}E_{i}dp_{i}+\sum _{i}p_{i}dE_{i}}]
And associating[13]
   &#x03B4; Q =  &#x2211;  i    E  i   d  p  i     {\displaystyle \delta Q=\sum
_{i}E_{i}dp_{i}}  [{\displaystyle \delta Q=\sum _{i}E_{i}dp_{i}}]
   &#x03B4; W =  &#x2211;  i    p  i   d  E  i     {\displaystyle \delta W=\sum
_{i}p_{i}dE_{i}}  [{\displaystyle \delta W=\sum _{i}p_{i}dE_{i}}]
We obtain the first law of thermodynamics:
   d U = &#x03B4; Q + &#x03B4; W   {\displaystyle dU=\delta Q+\delta W}  [
{\displaystyle dU=\delta Q+\delta W}]

In addition to including the entropy S and volume V terms in the internal
energy, a system is often described also in terms of the number of particles or
chemical species it contains:
         U = U ( S , V ,  N  1   , &#x2026; ,  N  n   )    {\displaystyle U=U
      (S,V,N_{1},\ldots ,N_{n})\,}  [U = U(S,V,N_1,\ldots,N_n)\,]
where Nj are the molar amounts of constituents of type j in the system. The
internal energy is an extensive function of the extensive variables S, V, and
the amounts Nj, the internal energy may be written as a linearly homogeneous
function of first degree:
         U ( &#x03B1; S , &#x03B1; V , &#x03B1;  N  1   , &#x03B1;  N  2   ,
      &#x2026; ) = &#x03B1; U ( S , V ,  N  1   ,  N  2   , &#x2026; )
      {\displaystyle U(\alpha S,\alpha V,\alpha N_{1},\alpha N_{2},\ldots
      )=\alpha U(S,V,N_{1},N_{2},\ldots )\,}  [U(\alpha S,\alpha V,\alpha N_
      {1},\alpha N_{2},\ldots )
       = \alpha U(S,V,N_{1},N_{2},\ldots)\,]
where α is a factor describing the growth of the system. The differential
internal energy may be written as
    d  U =    &#x2202; U   &#x2202; S     d  S +    &#x2202; U   &#x2202; V
d  V +  &#x2211;  i   &#xA0;    &#x2202; U   &#x2202;  N  i       d   N  i
&#xA0; = T   d  S &#x2212; p   d  V +  &#x2211;  i    &#x03BC;  i    d   N  i
{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U={\frac {\partial U}{\partial S}}\mathrm {d} S+
{\frac {\partial U}{\partial V}}\mathrm {d} V+\sum _{i}\ {\frac {\partial U}
{\partial N_{i}}}\mathrm {d} N_{i}\ =T\,\mathrm {d} S-p\,\mathrm {d} V+\sum _
{i}\mu _{i}\mathrm {d} N_{i}\,}  [\mathrm{d} U = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}
\mathrm{d} S  + \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \mathrm{d} V + \sum_i\ \frac
{\partial U}{\partial N_i} \mathrm{d} N_i\ = T \,\mathrm{d} S - p \,\mathrm{d}
V + \sum_i\mu_i \mathrm{d} N_i\,]
which shows (or defines) temperature T to be the partial derivative of U with
respect to entropy S and pressure p to be the negative of the similar
derivative with respect to volume V
   T =    &#x2202; U   &#x2202; S    ,   {\displaystyle T={\frac {\partial U}
{\partial S}},}  [T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S},]
   p = &#x2212;    &#x2202; U   &#x2202; V    ,   {\displaystyle p=-{\frac
{\partial U}{\partial V}},}  [p = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial V},]
and where the coefficients      &#x03BC;  i     {\displaystyle \mu _{i}}  [\mu_
{i}] are the chemical_potentials for the components of type i in the system.
The chemical potentials are defined as the partial derivatives of the energy
with respect to the variations in composition:
          &#x03BC;  i   =   (    &#x2202; U   &#x2202;  N  i      )   S , V ,
      N  j &#x2260; i       {\displaystyle \mu _{i}=\left({\frac {\partial U}
      {\partial N_{i}}}\right)_{S,V,N_{j\neq i}}}  [\mu_i = \left( \frac
      {\partial U}{\partial N_i} \right)_{S,V, N_{j \ne i}}]
As conjugate variables to the composition     {  N  j   }   {\displaystyle
\lbrace N_{j}\rbrace }  [\lbrace N_{j} \rbrace], the chemical potentials are
intensive_properties, intrinsically characteristic of the qualitative nature of
the system, and not proportional to its extent. Under conditions of constant T
and p, because of the extensive nature of U and its independent variables,
using Euler's_homogeneous_function_theorem, the differential dU may be
integrated and yields an expression for the internal energy:
         U = T S &#x2212; p V +  &#x2211;  i    &#x03BC;  i    N  i
      {\displaystyle U=TS-pV+\sum _{i}\mu _{i}N_{i}\,}  [U=TS-pV+\sum _{i}\mu _
      {i}N_{i}\,].
The sum over the composition of the system is the Gibbs_free_energy:
         G =  &#x2211;  i    &#x03BC;  i    N  i      {\displaystyle G=\sum _
      {i}\mu _{i}N_{i}\,}  [G = \sum_i \mu_i N_i\,]
that arises from changing the composition of the system at constant temperature
and pressure. For a single component system, the chemical potential equals the
Gibbs energy per amount of substance, i.e. particles or moles according to the
original definition of the unit for     {  N  j   }   {\displaystyle \lbrace N_
{j}\rbrace }  [\lbrace N_{j} \rbrace].
***** Internal energy in an elastic medium[edit] *****
For an elastic medium the mechanical energy term of the internal energy must be
replaced by the more general expression involving the stress      &#x03C3;  i j
{\displaystyle \sigma _{ij}}  [\sigma _{ij}] and strain      &#x03B5;  i j
{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{ij}}  [\varepsilon _{ij}]. The infinitesimal
statement is:
          d  U = T  d  S + V  &#x03C3;  i j    d   &#x03B5;  i j
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U=T\mathrm {d} S+V\sigma _{ij}\mathrm {d}
      \varepsilon _{ij}}  [\mathrm{d}U=T\mathrm{d}S+V\sigma_{ij}\mathrm
      {d}\varepsilon_{ij}]
where Einstein_notation has been used for the tensors, in which there is a
summation over all repeated indices in the product term. The Euler theorem
yields for the internal energy:[14]
         U = T S +   1 2    &#x03C3;  i j    &#x03B5;  i j     {\displaystyle
      U=TS+{\frac {1}{2}}\sigma _{ij}\varepsilon _{ij}}  [U=TS+\frac{1}
      {2}\sigma_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}]
For a linearly elastic material, the stress is related to the strain by:
          &#x03C3;  i j   =  C  i j k l    &#x03B5;  k l     {\displaystyle
      \sigma _{ij}=C_{ijkl}\varepsilon _{kl}}  [\sigma_{ij}=C_{ijkl}
      \varepsilon_{kl}]
where the Cijkl are the components of the 4th-rank elastic constant tensor of
the medium.
***** History[edit] *****
James_Joule studied the relationship between heat, work, and temperature. He
observed that if he did mechanical work on a fluid, such as water, by agitating
the fluid, its temperature increased. He proposed that the mechanical work he
was doing on the system was converted to thermal_energy. Specifically, he found
that 4185.5 joules of energy were needed to raise the temperature of a kilogram
of water by one degree Celsius.[15]
***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ a b c In this article we choose the sign convention of the mechanical
      work as typically defined in chemistry, which is different from the
      convention used in physics. In chemistry, work performed by the system
      against the environment, e.g., a system expansion, is negative, while in
      physics this is taken to be positive.
