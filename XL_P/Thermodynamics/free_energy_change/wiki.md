The thermodynamic free energy is a concept useful in the thermodynamics of
chemical or thermal processes in engineering and science. The change in the
free energy is the maximum amount of work that a thermodynamic_system can
perform in a process at constant temperature, and its sign indicates whether a
process is thermodynamically favorable or forbidden. Since free energy usually
contains potential_energy, it is not absolute but depends on the choice of a
zero point. Therefore, only relative free energy values, or changes in free
energy, are physically meaningful.
The free energy is a thermodynamic state_function, like the internal_energy,
enthalpy, and entropy.

***** Overview[edit] *****
Free energy is that portion of any first-law energy that is available to
perform thermodynamic work at constant temperature, i.e., work mediated by
thermal_energy. Free energy is subject to irreversible loss in the course of
such work.[1] Since first-law energy is always conserved, it is evident that
free energy is an expendable, second-law kind of energy. Several free energy
functions may be formulated based on system criteria. Free energy functions are
Legendre_transforms of the internal_energy.
The Gibbs_free_energy is given by G = H â TS, where H is the enthalpy, T is
the absolute_temperature, and S is the entropy. H = U + pV, where U is the
internal energy, p is the pressure, and V is the volume. G is the most useful
for processes involving a system at constant pressure p and temperature T,
because, in addition to subsuming any entropy change due merely to heat, a
change in G also excludes the p dV work needed to "make space for additional
molecules" produced by various processes. Gibbs free energy change therefore
equals work not associated with system expansion or compression, at constant
temperature and pressure. (Hence its utility to solution-phase chemists,
including biochemists.)
The historically earlier Helmholtz_free_energy is defined as A = U â TS. Its
change is equal to the amount of reversible work done on, or obtainable from, a
system at constant T. Thus its appellation "work content", and the designation
A from Arbeit, the German word for work. Since it makes no reference to any
quantities involved in work (such as p and V), the Helmholtz function is
completely general: its decrease is the maximum amount of work which can be
done by a system at constant temperature, and it can increase at most by the
amount of work done on a system isothermally. The Helmholtz free energy has a
special theoretical importance since it is proportional to the logarithm of the
partition_function for the canonical_ensemble in statistical_mechanics. (Hence
its utility to physicists; and to gas-phase chemists and engineers, who do not
want to ignore p dV work.)
Historically, the term 'free energy' has been used for either quantity. In
physics, free energy most often refers to the Helmholtz free energy, denoted by
A or F, while in chemistry, free energy most often refers to the Gibbs free
energy. The values of the two free energies are usually quite similar and the
intended free energy function is often implicit in manuscripts and
presentations.
**** Meaning of "free"[edit] ****
The basic definition of "energy" is a measure of a body's (in thermodynamics,
the system's) ability to cause change. For example, when a person pushes a
heavy box a few meters forward, that person exerts mechanical energy, also
known as work, on the box over a distance of a few meters forward. The
mathematical definition of this form of energy is the product of the force
exerted on the object and the distance by which the box moved (Work=Force x
Distance). Because the person changed the stationary position of the box, that
person exerted energy on that box. The work exerted can also be called "useful
energy". Because energy was converted from one form into the intended purpose,
i.e. mechanical utilisation. For the case of the person pushing the box, the
energy in the form of internal (or potential) energy obtained through
metabolism was converted into work in order to push the box. This energy
conversion, however, was not straight-forward. In other words, while some
internal energy went into pushing the box, some was diverted away (lost) in the
form of heat (transferred thermal energy). For a reversible process, heat is
the product of the absolute temperature T and the change in entropy S of a body
(entropy is a measure of disorder in a system). The difference between the
change in internal energy, which is ÎU, and the energy lost in the form of
heat is what is called the "useful energy" of the body, or the work of the body
performed on an object. In thermodynamics, this is what is known as "free
energy". In other words, free energy is a measure of work (useful energy) a
system can perform at constant temperature. Mathematically, free energy is
expressed as:
free energy A = U - TS
This expression has commonly been interpreted to mean that work is extracted
from the internal energy U while TS represents energy not available to perform
work. However, this is incorrect. For instance, in an isothermal expansion of
an ideal gas, the internal energy change is ÎU = 0 and the expansion work w =
-T ÎS is derived exclusively from the TS term supposedly not available to
perform work.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the theory_of_heat, i.e., that heat is a form
of energy having relation to vibratory motion, was beginning to supplant both
the caloric_theory, i.e., that heat is a fluid, and the four_element_theory, in
which heat was the lightest of the four elements. In a similar manner, during
these years, heat was beginning to be distinguished into different
classification categories, such as âfree heatâ, âcombined heatâ,
âradiant heatâ, specific_heat, heat_capacity, âabsolute heatâ,
âlatent caloricâ, âfreeâ or âperceptibleâ caloric (calorique
sensible), among others.
In 1780, for example, Laplace and Lavoisier stated: âIn general, one can
change the first hypothesis into the second by changing the words âfree heat,
combined heat, and heat releasedâ into âvis_viva, loss of vis viva, and
increase of vis viva.ââ In this manner, the total mass of caloric in a
body, called absolute heat, was regarded as a mixture of two components; the
free or perceptible caloric could affect a thermometer, whereas the other
component, the latent caloric, could not.[2] The use of the words âlatent
heatâ implied a similarity to latent heat in the more usual sense; it was
regarded as chemically bound to the molecules of the body. In the adiabatic
compression of a gas, the absolute heat remained constant but the observed rise
in temperature implied that some latent caloric had become âfreeâ or
perceptible.
During the early 19th century, the concept of perceptible or free caloric began
to be referred to as âfree heatâ or heat set free. In 1824, for example,
the French physicist Sadi_Carnot, in his famous âReflections on the Motive
Power of Fireâ, speaks of quantities of heat âabsorbed or set freeâ in
different transformations. In 1882, the German physicist and physiologist
Hermann_von_Helmholtz coined the phrase âfree energyâ for the expression E
â TS, in which the change in F (or G) determines the amount of energy
âfreeâ for work under the given conditions, specifically constant
temperature.[3]:235
Thus, in traditional use, the term âfreeâ was attached to Gibbs free energy
for systems at constant pressure and temperature, or to Helmholtz free energy
for systems at constant temperature, to mean âavailable in the form of useful
work.â[4] With reference to the Gibbs free energy, we need to add the
qualification that it is the energy free for non-volume work.[5]:77â79
An increasing number of books and journal articles do not include the
attachment âfreeâ, referring to G as simply Gibbs energy (and likewise for
the Helmholtz_energy). This is the result of a 1988 IUPAC meeting to set
unified terminologies for the international scientific community, in which the
adjective âfreeâ was supposedly banished.[6][7][8] This standard, however,
has not yet been universally adopted, and many published articles and books
still include the descriptive âfreeâ.[citation_needed]
***** Application[edit] *****
Just like the general concept of energy, free energy has a few definitions
suitable for different conditions. In physics, chemistry, and biology, these
conditions are thermodynamic parameters (temperature T, volume V, pressure p,
etc.). Scientists have come up with several ways to define free energy. The
mathematical expression of Helmholtz free energy is:
         A = U &#x2212; T S   {\displaystyle A=U-TS}  [{\displaystyle A=U-TS}]
This definition of free energy is useful for gas-phase reactions or in physics
when modeling the behavior of isolated systems kept at a constant volume. For
example, if a researcher wanted to perform a combustion reaction in a bomb
calorimeter, the volume is kept constant throughout the course of a reaction.
Therefore, the heat of the reaction is a direct measure of the free energy
change, q = ÎU. In solution chemistry, on the other hand, most chemical
reactions are kept at constant pressure. Under this condition, the heat q of
the reaction is equal to the enthalpy change ÎH of the system. Under constant
pressure and temperature, the free energy in a reaction is known as Gibbs free
energy G.
         G = H &#x2212; T S   {\displaystyle G=H-TS}  [{\displaystyle G=H-TS}]
These functions have a minimum in chemical equilibrium, as long as certain
variables (T, and V or p) are held constant. In addition, they also have
theoretical importance in deriving Maxwell_relations. Work other than p dV may
be added, e.g., for electrochemical cells, or f dx work in elastic materials
and in muscle contraction. Other forms of work which must sometimes be
considered are stress-strain, magnetic, as in adiabatic demagnetization used in
the approach to absolute_zero, and work due to electric polarization. These are
described by tensors.
In most cases of interest there are internal degrees_of_freedom and processes,
such as chemical_reactions and phase_transitions, which create entropy. Even
for homogeneous "bulk" materials, the free energy functions depend on the
(often suppressed) composition, as do all proper thermodynamic_potentials
(extensive_functions), including the internal energy.

If these quantities do not appear, it is impossible to describe compositional
changes. The differentials for processes at uniform pressure and temperature

Any decrease in the Gibbs function of a system is the upper limit for any
isothermal, isobaric work that can be captured in the surroundings, or it may
simply be dissipated, appearing as T times a corresponding increase in the
entropy of the system and/or its surrounding.
An example is surface_free_energy, the amount of increase of free energy when
the area of surface increases by every unit area.
The path_integral_Monte_Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining
the values of free energies, based on quantum dynamical principles.
**** Work and free energy change[edit] ****
For a reversible isothermal process, ÎS = qrev/T and therefore the definition
of A results in
         &#x0394; A = &#x0394; U &#x2212; T &#x0394; S = &#x0394; U &#x2212;  q
      r e v   =  w  r e v     {\displaystyle \Delta A=\Delta U-T\Delta S=\Delta
      U-q_{rev}=w_{rev}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta A=\Delta U-T\Delta S=\Delta U-
      q_{rev}=w_{rev}}] (at constant temperature)
This tells us that the change in free energy equals the reversible or maximum
work for a process performed at constant temperature. Under other conditions,
free-energy change is not equal to work; for instance, for a reversible
adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas,     &#x0394; A =  w  r e v   &#x2212; S
&#x0394; T   {\displaystyle \Delta A=w_{rev}-S\Delta T}  [{\displaystyle \Delta
A=w_{rev}-S\Delta T}]. Importantly, for a heat engine, including the Carnot
cycle, the free-energy change after a full cycle is zero,      &#x0394;  c y c
A = 0   {\displaystyle \Delta _{cyc}A=0}  [{\displaystyle \Delta _{cyc}A=0}],
while the engine produces nonzero work.
**** Free energy change and spontaneous processes[edit] ****
According to the second_law_of_thermodynamics, for any process that occurs in a
closed system, the inequality_of_Clausius, ÎS > q/Tsurr, applies. For a
process at constant temperature and pressure without non-PV work, this
inequality transforms into     &#x0394; G < 0   {\displaystyle \Delta G<0}  [
{\displaystyle \Delta G<0}]. Similarly, for a process at constant temperature
and volume,     &#x0394; F < 0   {\displaystyle \Delta F<0}  [{\displaystyle
\Delta F<0}]. Thus, a negative value of the change in free energy is a
necessary condition for a process to be spontaneous; this is the most useful
form of the second law of thermodynamics in chemistry. In chemical equilibrium
at constant T and p without electrical work, dG = 0.
***** History[edit] *****
The quantity called "free energy" is a more advanced and accurate replacement
for the outdated term affinity, which was used by chemists in previous years to
describe the force that caused chemical_reactions. The term affinity, as used
in chemical relation, dates back to at least the time of Albertus_Magnus in
1250.[citation_needed]
From the 1998 textbook Modern Thermodynamics[9] by Nobel Laureate and chemistry
professor Ilya_Prigogine we find: "As motion was explained by the Newtonian
concept of force, chemists wanted a similar concept of âdriving forceâ for
chemical change. Why do chemical reactions occur, and why do they stop at
certain points? Chemists called the âforceâ that caused chemical reactions
affinity, but it lacked a clear definition."
During the entire 18th century, the dominant view with regard to heat and light
was that put forth by Isaac_Newton, called the Newtonian hypothesis, which
states that light and heat are forms of matter attracted or repelled by other
forms of matter, with forces analogous to gravitation or to chemical affinity.
In the 19th century, the French chemist Marcellin_Berthelot and the Danish
chemist Julius_Thomsen had attempted to quantify affinity using heats_of
reaction. In 1875, after quantifying the heats of reaction for a large number
of compounds, Berthelot proposed the principle_of_maximum_work, in which all
chemical changes occurring without intervention of outside energy tend toward
the production of bodies or of a system of bodies which liberate heat.
In addition to this, in 1780 Antoine_Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon_Laplace laid
the foundations of thermochemistry by showing that the heat given out in a
reaction is equal to the heat absorbed in the reverse reaction. They also
investigated the specific_heat and latent_heat of a number of substances, and
amounts of heat given out in combustion. In a similar manner, in 1840 Swiss
chemist Germain_Hess formulated the principle that the evolution of heat in a
reaction is the same whether the process is accomplished in one-step process or
in a number of stages. This is known as Hess'_law. With the advent of the
mechanical_theory_of_heat in the early 19th century, Hess's law came to be
viewed as a consequence of the law of conservation_of_energy.
Based on these and other ideas, Berthelot and Thomsen, as well as others,
considered the heat given out in the formation of a compound as a measure of
the affinity, or the work done by the chemical forces. This view, however, was
not entirely correct. In 1847, the English physicist James_Joule showed that he
could raise the temperature of water by turning a paddle wheel in it, thus
showing that heat and mechanical work were equivalent or proportional to each
other, i.e., approximately, dW â dQ. This statement came to be known as the
mechanical_equivalent_of_heat and was a precursory form of the first_law_of
thermodynamics.
By 1865, the German physicist Rudolf_Clausius had shown that this equivalence
principle needed amendment. That is, one can use the heat derived from a
combustion_reaction in a coal furnace to boil water, and use this heat to
vaporize steam, and then use the enhanced high-pressure energy of the vaporized
steam to push a piston. Thus, we might naively reason that one can entirely
convert the initial combustion heat of the chemical reaction into the work of
pushing the piston. Clausius showed, however, that we must take into account
the work that the molecules of the working body, i.e., the water molecules in
the cylinder, do on each other as they pass or transform from one step of or
state of the engine_cycle to the next, e.g., from (P1,V1) to (P2,V2). Clausius
originally called this the âtransformation contentâ of the body, and then
later changed the name to entropy. Thus, the heat used to transform the working
body of molecules from one state to the next cannot be used to do external
work, e.g., to push the piston. Clausius defined this transformation heat as dQ
= T dS.
In 1873, Willard_Gibbs published A Method of Geometrical Representation of the
Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces, in which he
introduced the preliminary outline of the principles of his new equation able
to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue
when bodies or systems are brought into contact. By studying the interactions
of homogeneous substances in contact, i.e., bodies, being in composition part
solid, part liquid, and part vapor, and by using a three-dimensional volume-
entropy-internal_energy graph, Gibbs was able to determine three states of
equilibrium, i.e., "necessarily stable", "neutral", and "unstable", and whether
or not changes will ensue. In 1876, Gibbs built on this framework by
introducing the concept of chemical_potential so to take into account chemical
reactions and states of bodies that are chemically different from each other.
In his own words, to summarize his results in 1873, Gibbs states:
If we wish to express in a single equation the necessary and sufficient
condition of thermodynamic_equilibrium for a substance when surrounded by a
medium of constant pressure p and temperature T, this equation may be written:
      Î´(Îµ â TÎ· + pÎ½) = 0
when Î´ refers to the variation produced by any variations in the state of the
parts of the body, and (when different parts of the body are in different
states) in the proportion in which the body is divided between the different
states. The condition of stable equilibrium is that the value of the expression
in the parenthesis shall be a minimum.
In this description, as used by Gibbs, Îµ refers to the internal_energy of the
body, Î· refers to the entropy of the body, and Î½ is the volume of the body.
Hence, in 1882, after the introduction of these arguments by Clausius and
Gibbs, the German scientist Hermann_von_Helmholtz stated, in opposition to
Berthelot and Thomasâ hypothesis that chemical affinity is a measure of the
heat of reaction of chemical reaction as based on the principle of maximal
work, that affinity is not the heat given out in the formation of a compound
but rather it is the largest quantity of work which can be gained when the
reaction is carried out in a reversible manner, e.g., electrical work in a
reversible cell. The maximum work is thus regarded as the diminution of the
free, or available, energy of the system (Gibbs_free_energy G at T = constant,
P = constant or Helmholtz_free_energy F at T = constant, V = constant), whilst
the heat given out is usually a measure of the diminution of the total energy
of the system (Internal_energy). Thus, G or F is the amount of energy
âfreeâ for work under the given conditions.
Up until this point, the general view had been such that: âall chemical
reactions drive the system to a state of equilibrium in which the affinities of
the reactions vanishâ. Over the next 60 years, the term affinity came to be
replaced with the term free energy. According to chemistry historian Henry
Leicester, the influential 1923 textbook Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of
Chemical Reactions by Gilbert_N._Lewis and Merle_Randall led to the replacement
of the term âaffinityâ by the term âfree energyâ in much of the
English-speaking world.
