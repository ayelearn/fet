In chemistry, pH (/piËËeÉªtÊ/) is a scale used to specify how acidic or
basic a water-based_solution is. Acidic solutions have a lower pH, while basic
solutions have a higher pH. At room temperature (25 Â°C), pure_water is neither
acidic nor basic and has a pH of 7.
The pH scale is logarithmic and approximates the negative of the base 10
logarithm of the molar_concentration (measured in units of moles per liter) of
hydrogen_ions in a solution. More precisely it is the negative of the base 10
logarithm of the activity of the hydrogen ion.[1] At 25 Â°C, solutions with a
pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. The
neutral value of the pH depends on the temperature, being lower than 7 if the
temperature increases. The pH value can be less than 0 for very strong acids,
or greater than 14 for very strong bases.[2]
The pH scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose pH is
established by international agreement.[3] Primary pH standard values are
determined using a concentration_cell_with_transference, by measuring the
potential difference between a hydrogen_electrode and a standard electrode such
as the silver_chloride_electrode. The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured
with a glass_electrode and a pH_meter, or a color-changing indicator.
Measurements of pH are important in chemistry, agronomy, medicine, water
treatment, and many other applications.

***** History *****
The concept of pH was first introduced by the Danish chemist SÃ¸ren_Peder
Lauritz_SÃ¸rensen at the Carlsberg_Laboratory in 1909[4] and revised to the
modern pH in 1924 to accommodate definitions and measurements in terms of
electrochemical cells. In the first papers, the notation had the "H" as a
subscript to the lowercase "p", as so: pH.
The exact meaning of the "p" in "pH" is disputed, as SÃ¸rensen did not explain
why he used it.[5] He describes a way of measuring it using potential
differences, and it represents the negative power of 10 in the concentration of
hydrogen ions. All the words for these start with p in French, German and
Danish, all languages SÃ¸rensen published in: Carlsberg Laboratory was French-
speaking, German was the dominant language of scientific publishing, and
SÃ¸rensen was Danish. He also used "q" in much the same way elsewhere in the
paper. So the "p" could stand for the French puissance, German Potenz, or
Danish potens, meaning "power", or it could mean "potential". He might also
just have labelled the test solution "p" and the reference solution "q"
arbitrarily; these letters are often paired.[6] There is little to support the
suggestion that "pH" stands for the Latin_terms pondus hydrogenii (quantity of
hydrogen) or potentia hydrogenii (power of hydrogen).
Currently in chemistry, the p stands for "decimal cologarithm of", and is also
used in the term pKa, used for acid_dissociation_constants[7] and pOH, the
equivalent for hydroxide ions.
Bacteriologist Alice_C._Evans, famed for her work's influence on dairying and
food_safety, credited William Mansfield Clark and colleagues (of whom she was
one) with developing pH measuring methods in the 1910s, which had a wide
influence on laboratory and industrial use thereafter. In her memoir, she does
not mention how much, or how little, Clark and colleagues knew about
SÃ¸rensen's work a few years prior.[8]:10 She said:
     In these studies [of bacterial metabolism] Dr. Clark's attention was
     directed to the effect of acid on the growth of bacteria. He found
     that it is the intensity of the acid in terms of hydrogen-ion
     concentration that affects their growth. But existing methods of
     measuring acidity determined the quantity, not the intensity, of the
     acid. Next, with his collaborators, Dr. Clark developed accurate
     methods for measuring hydrogen-ion concentration. These methods
     replaced the inaccurate titration method of determining acid content
     in use in biologic laboratories throughout the world. Also they were
     found to be applicable in many industrial and other processes in
     which they came into wide usage.[8]:10
The first electronic method for measuring pH was invented by Arnold_Orville
Beckman, a professor at California_Institute_of_Technology in 1934.[9] It was
in response to local citrus grower Sunkist that wanted a better method for
quickly testing the pH of lemons they were picking from their nearby orchards.

***** Definition and measurement *****
**** pH ****
pH is defined as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen_ion
activity, aH+, in a solution.[3]
          pH  = &#x2212;  log  10   &#x2061; (  a    H  +      ) =  log  10
      &#x2061;  (   1  a    H  +        )    {\displaystyle {\ce {pH}}=-\log _
      {10}(a_{{\ce {H+}}})=\log _{10}\left({\frac {1}{a_{{\ce {H+}}}}}\right)}
      [{\displaystyle {\ce {pH}}=-\log _{10}(a_{{\ce {H+}}})=\log _{10}\left(
      {\frac {1}{a_{{\ce {H+}}}}}\right)}]
For example, for a solution with a hydrogen ion activity of 5×10â6 (at that
level, this is essentially the number of moles of hydrogen ions per liter of
solution) there is 1/(5×10â6) = 2×105, thus such a solution has a pH of log10
(2×105) = 5.3. For a commonplace example based on the facts that the masses of
a mole of water, a mole of hydrogen ions, and a mole of hydroxide_ions are
respectively 18 g, 1 g, and 17 g, a quantity of 107 moles of pure (pH 7) water,
or 180 tonnes (18×107 g), contains close to 1 g of dissociated hydrogen ions
(or rather 19 g of H3O+ hydronium ions) and 17 g of hydroxide ions.
Note that pH depends on temperature. For instance at 0 Â°C the pH of pure water
is 7.47. At 25 Â°C it's 7.00, and at 100 Â°C it's 6.14.
This definition was adopted because ion-selective_electrodes, which are used to
measure pH, respond to activity. Ideally, electrode potential, E, follows the
Nernst_equation, which, for the hydrogen ion can be written as
         E =  E  0   +    R T  F   ln &#x2061; (  a    H  +      ) =  E  0
      &#x2212;    2.303 R T  F    pH    {\displaystyle E=E^{0}+{\frac {RT}
      {F}}\ln(a_{{\ce {H+}}})=E^{0}-{\frac {2.303RT}{F}}{\ce {pH}}}  [
      {\displaystyle E=E^{0}+{\frac {RT}{F}}\ln(a_{{\ce {H+}}})=E^{0}-{\frac
      {2.303RT}{F}}{\ce {pH}}}]
where E is a measured potential, E0 is the standard electrode potential, R is
the gas_constant, T is the temperature in kelvins, F is the Faraday_constant.
For H+ number of electrons transferred is one. It follows that electrode
potential is proportional to pH when pH is defined in terms of activity.
Precise measurement of pH is presented in International Standard ISO_31-8 as
follows:[11] A galvanic_cell is set up to measure the electromotive_force
(e.m.f.) between a reference electrode and an electrode sensitive to the
hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed in the same aqueous solution.
The reference electrode may be a silver_chloride_electrode or a calomel
electrode. The hydrogen-ion selective electrode is a standard_hydrogen
electrode.
      Reference electrode | concentrated solution of KCl || test solution | H2
      | Pt[clarification_needed]
Firstly, the cell is filled with a solution of known hydrogen ion activity and
the emf, ES, is measured. Then the emf, EX, of the same cell containing the
solution of unknown pH is measured.
          pH  ( X )   =  pH  ( S )   +     E   S    &#x2212;  E   X     z
      {\displaystyle {\ce {pH(X)}}={\ce {pH(S)}}+{\frac {E_{{\ce {S}}}-E_{{\ce
      {X}}}}{z}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {pH(X)}}={\ce {pH(S)}}+{\frac {E_{{\ce
      {S}}}-E_{{\ce {X}}}}{z}}}]
The difference between the two measured emf values is proportional to pH. This
method of calibration avoids the need to know the standard electrode potential.
The proportionality constant, 1/z is ideally equal to       1  2.303 R T  /  F
&#xA0;   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2.303RT/F}}\ }  [{\frac {1}{2.303RT/F}}\ ]
the "Nernstian slope".
To apply this process in practice, a glass_electrode is used rather than the
cumbersome hydrogen electrode. A combined glass electrode has an in-built
reference electrode. It is calibrated against buffer_solutions of known
hydrogen ion activity. IUPAC has proposed the use of a set of buffer solutions
of known H+ activity.[3] Two or more buffer solutions are used in order to
accommodate the fact that the "slope" may differ slightly from ideal. To
implement this approach to calibration, the electrode is first immersed in a
standard solution and the reading on a pH_meter is adjusted to be equal to the
standard buffer's value. The reading from a second standard buffer solution is
then adjusted, using the "slope" control, to be equal to the pH for that
solution. Further details, are given in the IUPAC recommendations.[3] When more
than two buffer solutions are used the electrode is calibrated by fitting
observed pH values to a straight line with respect to standard buffer values.
Commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information on the value
at 25 Â°C and a correction factor to be applied for other temperatures.
The pH scale is logarithmic and therefore pH is a dimensionless_quantity.
**** p[H] ****
This was the original definition of SÃ¸rensen in 1909,[12] which was superseded
in favor of pH in 1924. [H] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, denoted [H+]
in modern chemistry, which appears to have units of concentration. More
correctly, the thermodynamic activity of H+ in dilute solution should be
replaced by [H+]/c0, where the standard state concentration c0 = 1 mol/L. This
ratio is a pure number whose logarithm can be defined.
However, it is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly,
if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One way
to do this, which has been used extensively, is to titrate a solution of known
concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong
alkaline in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background
electrolyte. Since the concentrations of acid and alkaline are known, it is
easy to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions so that the measured
potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually
carried out using a Gran_plot.[13] The calibration yields a value for the
standard electrode potential, E0, and a slope factor, f, so that the Nernst
equation in the form
         E =  E  0   + f    2.303 R T  F   log &#x2061; [   H  +    ]
      {\displaystyle E=E^{0}+f{\frac {2.303RT}{F}}\log[{\ce {H+}}]}  [
      {\displaystyle E=E^{0}+f{\frac {2.303RT}{F}}\log[{\ce {H+}}]}]
can be used to derive hydrogen ion concentrations from experimental
measurements of E. The slope factor, f, is usually slightly less than one. A
slope factor of less than 0.95 indicates that the electrode is not functioning
correctly. The presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion
activity coefficient is effectively constant during the titration. As it is
constant, its value can be set to one by defining the standard_state as being
the solution containing the background electrolyte. Thus, the effect of using
this procedure is to make activity equal to the numerical value of
concentration.
The glass electrode (and other ion_selective_electrodes) should be calibrated
in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes
to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a
solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition, as detailed below.
The difference between p[H] and pH is quite small. It has been stated[14] that
pH = p[H] + 0.04. It is common practice to use the term "pH" for both types of
measurement.
**** pH indicators ****
Main article: Universal_indicator
Chart showing the variation of color of universal indicator paper with pH
Indicators may be used to measure pH, by making use of the fact that their
color changes with pH. Visual comparison of the color of a test solution with a
standard color chart provides a means to measure pH accurate to the nearest
whole number. More precise measurements are possible if the color is measured
spectrophotometrically, using a colorimeter or spectrophotometer. Universal
indicator consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous
color change from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is made from
absorbent paper that has been impregnated with universal indicator. Another
method of measuring pH is using an electronic pH_meter.
**** pOH ****
Relation between p[OH] and p[H] (red = acidic region, blue = basic region)
pOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions.
OHâ. pOH values are derived from pH measurements. The concentration of
hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by
         [   OH  &#x2212;    ] =    K   W     [   H  +    ]      {\displaystyle
      [{\ce {OH^-}}]={\frac {K_{{\ce {W}}}}{[{\ce {H^+}}]}}}  [{\displaystyle [
      {\ce {OH^-}}]={\frac {K_{{\ce {W}}}}{[{\ce {H^+}}]}}}]
where KW is the self-ionisation constant of water. Taking logarithms
          pOH  =  p   K   W    &#x2212;  pH    {\displaystyle {\ce {pOH}}={\ce
      {p}}K_{{\ce {W}}}-{\ce {pH}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {pOH}}={\ce {p}}K_{
      {\ce {W}}}-{\ce {pH}}}]
So, at room temperature, pOH â 14 â pH. However this relationship is not
strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of soil
alkalinity.
**** Extremes of pH ****
Measurement of pH below about 2.5 (ca. 0.003 mol dmâ3 acid) and above about
10.5 (ca. 0.0003 mol dmâ3 alkaline) requires special procedures because, when
using the glass electrode, the Nernst_law breaks down under those conditions.
Various factors contribute to this. It cannot be assumed that liquid_junction
potentials are independent of pH.[15] Also, extreme pH implies that the
solution is concentrated, so electrode potentials are affected by ionic
strength variation. At high pH the glass electrode may be affected by "alkaline
error", because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations
such as Na+ and K+ in the solution.[16] Specially constructed electrodes are
available which partly overcome these problems.
Runoff from mines or mine tailings can produce some very low pH values.[17]
**** Non-aqueous solutions ****
Hydrogen ion concentrations (activities) can be measured in non-aqueous
solvents. pH values based on these measurements belong to a different scale
from aqueous pH values, because activities relate to different standard_states.
Hydrogen ion activity, aH+, can be defined[18][19] as:
          a    H  +      = exp &#x2061;  (     &#x03BC;    H  +      &#x2212;
      &#x03BC;    H  +      &#x2296;     R T    )    {\displaystyle a_{{\ce
      {H+}}}=\exp \left({\frac {\mu _{{\ce {H+}}}-\mu _{{\ce {H+}}}^{\ominus }}
      {RT}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle a_{{\ce {H+}}}=\exp \left({\frac {\mu _{
      {\ce {H+}}}-\mu _{{\ce {H+}}}^{\ominus }}{RT}}\right)}]
where Î¼H+ is the chemical_potential of the hydrogen ion,      &#x03BC;    H  +
&#x2296;     {\displaystyle \mu _{{\ce {H+}}}^{\ominus }}  [{\displaystyle \mu
_{{\ce {H+}}}^{\ominus }}] is its chemical potential in the chosen standard
state, R is the gas_constant and T is the thermodynamic_temperature. Therefore,
pH values on the different scales cannot be compared directly due to different
solvated proton ions such as lyonium ions, requiring an intersolvent scale
which involves the transfer activity coefficient of hydronium/lyonium_ion.
pH is an example of an acidity_function. Other acidity functions can be
defined. For example, the Hammett_acidity_function, H0, has been developed in
connection with superacids.
**** Unified absolute pH scale ****
The concept of "unified pH scale" has been developed on the basis of the
absolute chemical potential of the proton. This model uses the Lewis
acidâbase definition. This scale applies to liquids, gases and even solids.
[20] In 2010, a new "unified absolute pH scale" has been proposed that would
allow various pH ranges across different solutions to use a common proton
reference standard.[21]
***** Applications *****
Pure water is neutral. When an acid is dissolved in water, the pH will be less
than 7 (25 Â°C). When a base, or alkali, is dissolved in water, the pH will be
greater than 7. A solution of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric_acid, at
concentration 1 mol dmâ3 has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such
as sodium_hydroxide, at concentration 1 mol dmâ3, has a pH of 14. Thus,
measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14, though negative pH
values and values above 14 are entirely possible. Since pH is a logarithmic
scale, a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in
hydrogen ion concentration.
The pH of neutrality is not exactly 7 (25 Â°C), although this is a good
approximation in most cases. Neutrality is defined as the condition where [H+]
= [OHâ] (or the activities are equal). Since self-ionization_of_water holds
the product of these concentration [H+]×[OHâ] = Kw, it can be seen that at
neutrality [H+] = [OHâ] = √Kw, or pH = pKw/2. pKw is approximately 14 but
depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does
also. Pure water and a solution of NaCl in pure water are both neutral, since
dissociation_of_water produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of
the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure
water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on ionic
strength, so Kw varies with ionic strength.
If pure water is exposed to air it becomes mildly acidic. This is because water
absorbs carbon_dioxide from the air, which is then slowly converted into
bicarbonate and hydrogen ions (essentially creating carbonic_acid).

**** pH in soil ****
*** Classification of soil pH ranges ***
The United States Department of Agriculture Natural_Resources_Conservation
Service, formerly Soil Conservation Service classifies soil pH ranges as
follows: [22]
Nutritional elements availability within soil varies with pH. Light blue color
represents the ideal range for most plants.
Denomination           pH range
Ultra acidic           < 3.5
Extremely acidic       3.5â4.4
Very strongly acidic   4.5â5.0
Strongly acidic        5.1â5.5
Moderately acidic      5.6â6.0
Slightly acidic        6.1â6.5
Neutral                6.6â7.3
Slightly alkaline      7.4â7.8
Moderately alkaline    7.9â8.4
Strongly alkaline      8.5â9.0
Very strongly alkaline > 9.0
**** pH in nature ****
Lemon_juice tastes sour because it contains 5% to 6% citric_acid and has a pH
of 2.2. (high acidity)
pH-dependent plant_pigments that can be used as pH_indicators occur in many
plants, including hibiscus, red_cabbage (anthocyanin) and red_wine. The juice
of citrus fruits is acidic mainly because it contains citric_acid. Other
carboxylic_acids occur in many living systems. For example, lactic_acid is
produced by muscle activity. The state of protonation of phosphate derivatives,
such as ATP, is pH-dependent. The functioning of the oxygen-transport enzyme
hemoglobin is affected by pH in a process known as the Root_effect.
**** Seawater ****
See also: Ocean_acidification
The pH of seawater is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4.[23] It
plays an important role in the ocean's carbon_cycle, and there is evidence of
ongoing ocean_acidification caused by carbon_dioxide_emissions.[24] However, pH
measurement is complicated by the chemical_properties of seawater, and several
distinct pH scales exist in chemical_oceanography.[25]
As part of its operational_definition of the pH scale, the IUPAC defines a
series of buffer_solutions across a range of pH values (often denoted with NBS
or NIST designation). These solutions have a relatively low ionic_strength
(â0.1) compared to that of seawater (â0.7), and, as a consequence, are not
recommended for use in characterizing the pH of seawater, since the ionic
strength differences cause changes in electrode_potential. To resolve this
problem, an alternative series of buffers based on artificial_seawater was
developed.[26] This new series resolves the problem of ionic strength
differences between samples and the buffers, and the new pH scale is referred
to as the 'total scale', often denoted as pHT. The total scale was defined
using a medium containing sulfate ions. These ions experience protonation, H+ +
SO2â
4 â HSOâ
4, such that the total scale includes the effect of both protons (free hydrogen
ions) and hydrogen sulfate ions:
      [H+]T = [H+]F + [HSOâ
      4]
An alternative scale, the 'free scale', often denoted 'pHF', omits this
consideration and focuses solely on [H+]F, in principle making it a simpler
representation of hydrogen ion concentration. Only [H+]T can be determined,[27]
therefore [H+]F must be estimated using the [SO2â
4] and the stability constant of HSOâ
4, K*
S:
      [H+]F = [H+]T â [HSOâ
      4] = [H+]T ( 1 + [SO2â
      4] / K*
      S )â1
However, it is difficult to estimate K*
S in seawater, limiting the utility of the otherwise more straightforward free
scale.
Another scale, known as the 'seawater scale', often denoted 'pHSWS', takes
account of a further protonation relationship between hydrogen ions and
fluoride ions, H+ + Fâ â HF. Resulting in the following expression for
[H+]SWS:
      [H+]SWS = [H+]F + [HSOâ
      4] + [HF]
However, the advantage of considering this additional complexity is dependent
upon the abundance of fluoride in the medium. In seawater, for instance,
sulfate ions occur at much greater concentrations (>400 times) than those of
fluoride. As a consequence, for most practical purposes, the difference between
the total and seawater scales is very small.
The following three equations summarise the three scales of pH:
      pHF = â log [H+]F
      pHT = â log ( [H+]F + [HSOâ
      4] ) = â log [H+]T
      pHSWS = â log ( [H+]F + [HSOâ
      4] + [HF] ) = â log [H+]SWS
In practical terms, the three seawater pH scales differ in their values by up
to 0.12 pH units, differences that are much larger than the accuracy of pH
measurements typically required, in particular, in relation to the ocean's
carbonate_system.[25] Since it omits consideration of sulfate and fluoride
ions, the free scale is significantly different from both the total and
seawater scales. Because of the relative unimportance of the fluoride ion, the
total and seawater scales differ only very slightly.

tightly regulated in a process called acid-base_homeostasis. The most common
disorder in acid-base homeostasis is acidosis, which means an acid overload in
the body, generally defined by pH falling below 7.35. Alkalosis is the opposite
condition, with blood pH being excessively high.
The pH of blood is usually slightly basic with a value of pH 7.365. This value
is often referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine. Plaque can
create a local acidic environment that can result in tooth_decay by
demineralization. Enzymes and other proteins have an optimum pH range and can
become inactivated or denatured outside this range.
***** Calculations of pH *****
The calculation of the pH of a solution containing acids and/or bases is an
example of a chemical speciation calculation, that is, a mathematical procedure
for calculating the concentrations of all chemical species that are present in
the solution. The complexity of the procedure depends on the nature of the
solution. For strong acids and bases no calculations are necessary except in
extreme situations. The pH of a solution containing a weak acid requires the
solution of a quadratic_equation. The pH of a solution containing a weak base
may require the solution of a cubic_equation. The general case requires the
solution of a set of non-linear simultaneous_equations.
A complicating factor is that water itself is a weak acid and a weak base (see
amphoterism). It dissociates according to the equilibrium
          2   H  2      O       &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;
      &#x21C0;        H  3       O  +    ( aq )  + OH  &#x2212;   ( aq )
      {\displaystyle {\ce {2H2O <=> H3O+ (aq) + OH^-(aq)}}}  [{\displaystyle
      {\ce {2H2O <=> H3O+ (aq) + OH^-(aq)}}}]
with a dissociation_constant, Kw defined as
          K  w   =   [  H  +   ]   [ OH  &#x2212;  ]     {\displaystyle K_{w}=
      {\ce {[H+][OH^-]}}}  [{\displaystyle K_{w}={\ce {[H+][OH^-]}}}]
where [H+] stands for the concentration of the aqueous hydronium_ion and
[OHâ] represents the concentration of the hydroxide_ion. This equilibrium
needs to be taken into account at high pH and when the solute concentration is
extremely low.
**** Strong acids and bases ****
Strong_acids and bases are compounds that, for practical purposes, are
completely dissociated in water. Under normal circumstances this means that the
concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic solution can be taken to be equal to
the concentration of the acid. The pH is then equal to minus the logarithm of
the concentration value. Hydrochloric_acid (HCl) is an example of a strong
acid. The pH of a 0.01M solution of HCl is equal to âlog10(0.01), that is, pH
= 2. Sodium_hydroxide, NaOH, is an example of a strong base. The p[OH] value of
a 0.01M solution of NaOH is equal to âlog10(0.01), that is, p[OH] = 2. From
the definition of p[OH] above, this means that the pH is equal to about 12. For
solutions of sodium hydroxide at higher concentrations the self-ionization
equilibrium must be taken into account.
Self-ionization must also be considered when concentrations are extremely low.
Consider, for example, a solution of hydrochloric acid at a concentration of
5Ã10â8M. The simple procedure given above would suggest that it has a pH of
7.3. This is clearly wrong as an acid solution should have a pH of less than 7.
Treating the system as a mixture of hydrochloric acid and the amphoteric
substance water, a pH of 6.89 results.[31]
**** Weak acids and bases ****
A weak acid or the conjugate acid of a weak base can be treated using the same
formalism.
           {     Acid :     HA       &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;
      &#x21C0;        H  +   +  A  &#x2212;         Base :      HA  +
      &#x21BD;     &#x2212;         &#x2212;     &#x21C0;        H  +   + A
      {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}{\ce {Acid:}}&{\ce {HA <=> H+ + A^-}}\\{\ce
      {Base:}}&{\ce {HA+ <=> H+ + A}}\end{cases}}}  [{\displaystyle {\begin
      {cases}{\ce {Acid:}}&{\ce {HA <=> H+ + A^-}}\\{\ce {Base:}}&{\ce {HA+ <=>
      H+ + A}}\end{cases}}}]
First, an acid dissociation constant is defined as follows. Electrical charges
are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake of generality
          K  a   =     [ H ]   [ A ]     [ HA ]       {\displaystyle K_{a}=
      {\frac {{\ce {[H] [A]}}}{{\ce {[HA]}}}}}  [{\displaystyle K_{a}={\frac {
      {\ce {[H] [A]}}}{{\ce {[HA]}}}}}]
and its value is assumed to have been determined by experiment. This being so,
there are three unknown concentrations, [HA], [H+] and [Aâ] to determine by
calculation. Two additional equations are needed. One way to provide them is to
apply the law of mass_conservation in terms of the two "reagents" H and A.
          C   A    =   [ A ]   +   [ HA ]     {\displaystyle C_{{\ce {A}}}={\ce
      {[A]}}+{\ce {[HA]}}}  [{\displaystyle C_{{\ce {A}}}={\ce {[A]}}+{\ce {
      [HA]}}}]
          C   H    =   [ H ]   +   [ HA ]     {\displaystyle C_{{\ce {H}}}={\ce
      {[H]}}+{\ce {[HA]}}}  [{\displaystyle C_{{\ce {H}}}={\ce {[H]}}+{\ce {
      [HA]}}}]
C stands for analytical_concentration. In some texts, one mass balance equation
is replaced by an equation of charge balance. This is satisfactory for simple
cases like this one, but is more difficult to apply to more complicated cases
as those below. Together with the equation defining Ka, there are now three
equations in three unknowns. When an acid is dissolved in water CA = CH = Ca,
the concentration of the acid, so [A] = [H]. After some further algebraic
manipulation an equation in the hydrogen ion concentration may be obtained.
         [  H   ]  2   +  K  a   [  H  ] &#x2212;  K  a    C  a   = 0
      {\displaystyle [{\ce {H}}]^{2}+K_{a}[{\ce {H}}]-K_{a}C_{a}=0}  [
      {\displaystyle [{\ce {H}}]^{2}+K_{a}[{\ce {H}}]-K_{a}C_{a}=0}]
Solution of this quadratic_equation gives the hydrogen ion concentration and
hence p[H] or, more loosely, pH. This procedure is illustrated in an ICE_table
which can also be used to calculate the pH when some additional (strong) acid
or alkaline has been added to the system, that is, when CA â  CH.
For example, what is the pH of a 0.01M solution of benzoic_acid, pKa = 4.19?
    * Step 1:      K  a   =  10  &#x2212; 4.19   = 6.46 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212;
      5     {\displaystyle K_{a}=10^{-4.19}=6.46\times 10^{-5}}  [
      {\displaystyle K_{a}=10^{-4.19}=6.46\times 10^{-5}}]
    * Step 2: Set up the quadratic equation.     [  H   ]  2   + 6.46 &#x00D7;
      10  &#x2212; 5   [  H  ] &#x2212; 6.46 &#x00D7;  10  &#x2212; 7   = 0
      {\displaystyle [{\ce {H}}]^{2}+6.46\times 10^{-5}[{\ce {H}}]-6.46\times
      10^{-7}=0}  [{\displaystyle [{\ce {H}}]^{2}+6.46\times 10^{-5}[{\ce
      {H}}]-6.46\times 10^{-7}=0}]
    * Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation.     [   H  +    ] = 7.74 &#x00D7;
      10  &#x2212; 4   ;   p H  = 3.11   {\displaystyle [{\ce {H+}}]=7.74\times
      10^{-4};\quad \mathrm {pH} =3.11}  [{\displaystyle [{\ce
      {H+}}]=7.74\times 10^{-4};\quad \mathrm {pH} =3.11}]
For alkaline solutions an additional term is added to the mass-balance equation
for hydrogen. Since addition of hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion
concentration, and the hydroxide ion concentration is constrained by the self-
ionization equilibrium to be equal to        K  w     [  H  +   ]
{\displaystyle {\frac {K_{w}}{{\ce {[H+]}}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {K_{w}}{
{\ce {[H+]}}}}}]
          C  H   =    [  H  ] + [  HA  ] &#x2212;  K  w     [ H ]
      {\displaystyle C_{\ce {H}}={\frac {[{\ce {H}}]+[{\ce {HA}}]-K_{w}}{\ce {
      [H]}}}}  [{\displaystyle C_{\ce {H}}={\frac {[{\ce {H}}]+[{\ce {HA}}]-K_
      {w}}{\ce {[H]}}}}]
In this case the resulting equation in [H] is a cubic equation.
**** General method ****
Some systems, such as with polyprotic acids, are amenable to spreadsheet
calculations.[32] With three or more reagents or when many complexes are formed
with general formulae such as ApBqHr,the following general method can be used
to calculate the pH of a solution. For example, with three reagents, each
equilibrium is characterized by an equilibrium constant, Î².
         [   A   p     B   q     H   r   ] =  &#x03B2;  p q r   [  A   ]  p
      [  B   ]  q   [  H   ]  r     {\displaystyle [{\ce {A}}_{p}{\ce {B}}_{q}
      {\ce {H}}_{r}]=\beta _{pqr}[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce {B}}]^{q}[{\ce {H}}]^{r}}
      [{\displaystyle [{\ce {A}}_{p}{\ce {B}}_{q}{\ce {H}}_{r}]=\beta _{pqr}[
      {\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce {B}}]^{q}[{\ce {H}}]^{r}}]
Next, write down the mass-balance equations for each reagent:
              C  A      = [  A  ] + &#x03A3; p  &#x03B2;  p q r   [  A   ]  p
      [  B   ]  q   [  H   ]  r        C  B      = [  B  ] + &#x03A3; q
      &#x03B2;  p q r   [  A   ]  p   [  B   ]  q   [  H   ]  r        C  H
      = [  H  ] + &#x03A3; r  &#x03B2;  p q r   [  A   ]  p   [  B   ]  q
      [  H   ]  r   &#x2212;  K  w   [  H   ]  &#x2212; 1
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}C_{\ce {A}}&=[{\ce {A}}]+\Sigma p\beta _
      {pqr}[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce {B}}]^{q}[{\ce {H}}]^{r}\\C_{\ce {B}}&=[{\ce
      {B}}]+\Sigma q\beta _{pqr}[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce {B}}]^{q}[{\ce {H}}]^
      {r}\\C_{\ce {H}}&=[{\ce {H}}]+\Sigma r\beta _{pqr}[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce
      {B}}]^{q}[{\ce {H}}]^{r}-K_{w}[{\ce {H}}]^{-1}\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}C_{\ce {A}}&=[{\ce {A}}]+\Sigma p\beta _
      {pqr}[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce {B}}]^{q}[{\ce {H}}]^{r}\\C_{\ce {B}}&=[{\ce
      {B}}]+\Sigma q\beta _{pqr}[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce {B}}]^{q}[{\ce {H}}]^
      {r}\\C_{\ce {H}}&=[{\ce {H}}]+\Sigma r\beta _{pqr}[{\ce {A}}]^{p}[{\ce
      {B}}]^{q}[{\ce {H}}]^{r}-K_{w}[{\ce {H}}]^{-1}\end{aligned}}}]
Note that there are no approximations involved in these equations, except that
each stability constant is defined as a quotient of concentrations, not
activities. Much more complicated expressions are required if activities are to
be used.
There are 3 non-linear simultaneous_equations in the three unknowns, [A], [B]
and [H]. Because the equations are non-linear, and because concentrations may
range over many powers of 10, the solution of these equations is not
straightforward. However, many computer programs are available which can be
used to perform these calculations. There may be more than three reagents. The
calculation of hydrogen ion concentrations, using this formalism, is a key
element in the determination_of_equilibrium_constants by potentiometric
titration.
