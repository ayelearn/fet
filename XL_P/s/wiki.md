***** History *****
**** Origin ****
Further information: Shin_(letter), Sigma, San_(letter), and Sho_(letter)
Northwest_Semitic Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ®n represented a voiceless_postalveolar_fricative /ÃŠÂƒ/ (as
in 'ship'). It originated most likely as a pictogram of a tooth (Ã—Â©Ã—Â Ã—Â) and
represented the phoneme /ÃŠÂƒ/ via the acrophonic principle.[3]
Greek did not have a /ÃŠÂƒ/ phoneme, so the derived Greek letter sigma (ÃÂ£) came
to represent the voiceless_alveolar_sibilant /s/. While the letter shape ÃÂ£
continues Phoenician Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ®n, its name sigma is taken from the letter samekh,
while the shape and position of samekh but name of Ã…Â¡ÃƒÂ®n is continued in the
xi.[citation_needed] Within Greek, the name of sigma was influenced by its
association with the Greek word ÃÂƒÃÂ¯ÃÂ¶ÃÂ‰ (earlier *sigj-) "to hiss". The
original name of the letter "sigma" may have been san, but due to the
complicated early history of the Greek epichoric alphabets, "san" came to be
identified as a separate letter, ÃÂº.[4] Herodotus reports that "San" was the
name given by the Dorians to the same letter called "Sigma" by the Ionians.[5]
The Western_Greek_alphabet used in Cumae was adopted by the Etruscans and
Latins in the 7th century BC, over the following centuries developing into a
range of Old_Italic_alphabets including the Etruscan_alphabet and the early
Latin_alphabet. In Etruscan, the value /s/ of Greek sigma (Ã°ÂÂŒÂ”) was
maintained, while san (Ã°ÂÂŒÂ‘) represented a separate phoneme, most likely /ÃŠÂƒ/
(transliterated as Ã…Â›). The early Latin alphabet adopted sigma, but not san, as
Old Latin did not have a /ÃŠÂƒ/ phoneme.
The shape of Latin S arises from Greek ÃÂ£ by dropping one out of the four
strokes of that letter. The (angular) S-shape composed of three strokes existed
as a variant of the four-stroke letter ÃÂ£ already in the epigraphy in Western
Greek_alphabets, and the three and four strokes variants existed alongside one
another in the classical Etruscan alphabet. In other Italic_alphabets (Venetic,
Lepontic), the letter could be represented as a zig-zagging line of any number
between three and six strokes.
The Italic letter was also adopted into Elder_Futhark, as SowilÃ…Â (
Ã¡Â›ÂŠ), and appears with four to eight strokes in the earliest runic
inscriptions, but is occasionally reduced to three strokes (
Ã¡Â›Â‹) from the later 5th century, and appears regularly with three strokes in
Younger_Futhark.
**** Long s ****
Late medieval German script (Swabian bastarda, dated 1496) illustrating the use
of long and round s: prieÃ…Â¿ters tochter ("priest's daughter").
Main article: long_s
The minuscule_form Ã…Â¿, called the long_s, developed in the early medieval
period, within the Visigothic and Carolingian hands, with predecessors in the
half-uncial and cursive scripts of Late_Antiquity. It remained standard in
western writing throughout the medieval period and was adopted in early
printing with movable types. It existed alongside minuscule "round" or "short"
s, which was at the time only used at the end of words.
In most western orthographies, the Ã…Â¿ gradually fell out of use during the
second half of the 18th century, although it remained in occasional use into
the 19th century. In Spain, the change was mainly accomplished between the
years 1760 and 1766. In France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793.
Printers in the United States stopped using the long s between 1795 and 1810.
In English orthography, the London printer John_Bell (1745Ã¢Â€Â“1831) pioneered
the change. His edition of Shakespeare, in 1785, was advertised with the claim
that he "ventured to depart from the common mode by rejecting the long 'Ã…Â¿' in
favor of the round one, as being less liable to error....."[6] The_Times of
London made the switch from the long to the short s with its issue of 10
September 1803. EncyclopÃƒÂ¦dia_Britannica's 5th edition, completed in 1817, was
the last edition to use the long s.
In German_orthography, long s was retained in Fraktur (Schwabacher) type as
well as in standard cursive (SÃƒÂ¼tterlin) well into the 20th century, and was
officially abolished in 1941.[7] The ligature of Ã…Â¿s (or Ã…Â¿z) was retained,
however, giving rise to the Eszett, ÃƒÂŸ in contemporary German orthography.
***** Use in writing systems *****
The letter &#x27e8;s&#x27e9; is the seventh most common letter in English and
the third-most common consonant after &#x27e8;t&#x27e9; and &#x27e8;n&#x27e9;.
[8] It is the most common letter in starting and ending position.[citation
needed]
In English and several other languages, primarily Western_Romance ones like
Spanish and French, final &#x27e8;s&#x27e9; is the usual mark of plural nouns.
It is the regular ending of English third_person present_tense verbs.
&#x27e8;s&#x27e9; represents the voiceless_alveolar or voiceless_dental
sibilant /s/ in most languages as well as in the International_Phonetic
Alphabet. It also commonly represents the voiced_alveolar or voiced_dental
sibilant /z/, as in Portuguese mesa (table) or English 'rose' and 'bands', or
it may represent the voiceless_palato-alveolar_fricative [ÃŠÂƒ], as in most
Portuguese_dialects when syllable-finally, in Hungarian, in German (before
&#x27e8;p&#x27e9;, &#x27e8;t&#x27e9;) and some English words as 'sugar', since
yod-coalescence became a dominant feature, and [ÃŠÂ’], as in English 'measure'
(also because of yod-coalescence), European_Portuguese IslÃƒÂ£o (Islam) or, in
many sociolects of Brazilian_Portuguese, esdrÃƒÂºxulo (proparoxytone) in some
Andalusian_dialects, it merged with Peninsular_Spanish &#x27e8;c&#x27e9; and
&#x27e8;z&#x27e9; and is now pronounced [ÃÂ¸]. In some English words of French
origin, the letter &#x27e8;s&#x27e9; is silent, as in 'isle' or 'debris'.
The &#x27e8;sh&#x27e9;_digraph for English /ÃŠÂƒ/ arises in Middle English
(alongside &#x27e8;sch&#x27e9;), replacing the Old English &#x27e8;sc&#x27e9;
digraph. Similarly, Old High German &#x27e8;sc&#x27e9; was replaced by
&#x27e8;sch&#x27e9; in Early Modern High German orthography.
