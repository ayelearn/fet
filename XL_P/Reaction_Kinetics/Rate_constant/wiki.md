****** Reaction rate constant ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In chemical_kinetics a reaction rate constant or reaction rate coefficient, k,
quantifies the rate of a chemical_reaction.[1]
For a reaction between reactants A and B to form product C
      a A + b B â c C
the reaction_rate is often found to have the form:
         r = k ( T ) [  A   ]  m   [  B   ]  n     {\displaystyle r=k(T)
      [\mathrm {A} ]^{m}[\mathrm {B} ]^{n}}  [{\displaystyle r=k(T)[\mathrm {A}
      ]^{m}[\mathrm {B} ]^{n}}]
Here k(T) is the reaction rate constant that depends on temperature. [A] and
[B] are the molar_concentrations of substances A and B in moles per unit volume
of solution, assuming the reaction is taking place throughout the volume of the
solution. (For a reaction taking place at a boundary one would use instead
moles of A or B per unit area.)
The exponents m and n are called partial orders of reaction and are not
generally equal to the stoichiometric_coefficients a and b. Instead they depend
on the reaction_mechanism and can be determined experimentally.

***** Elementary steps[edit] *****
For an elementary_step, there is a relationship between stoichiometry and rate
law, as determined by the law_of_mass_action. Almost all elementary steps are
either unimolecular or bimolecular. For a unimolecular step
      A â P
the reaction rate is described by     r =  k  1   [  A  ]   {\displaystyle r=k_
{1}[\mathrm {A} ]}  [{\displaystyle r=k_{1}[\mathrm {A} ]}], where      k  1
{\displaystyle k_{1}}  [k_{1}] is a unimolecular rate constant. Since a
reaction requires a change in molecular geometry, unimolecular rate constants
cannot be larger than the frequency of a molecular vibration. Thus, in general,
a unimolecular rate constant has an upper limit of k1 â¤ ~1013 sâ1.
For a bimolecular step
      A + B â P
the reaction rate is described by     r =  k  2   [  A  ] [  B  ]
{\displaystyle r=k_{2}[\mathrm {A} ][\mathrm {B} ]}  [{\displaystyle r=k_{2}
[\mathrm {A} ][\mathrm {B} ]}], where      k  2     {\displaystyle k_{2}}  [k_
{2}] is a bimolecular rate constant. Bimolecular rate constants have an upper
limit that is determined by how frequently molecules can collide, and the
fastest such processes are limited by diffusion. Thus, in general, a
bimolecular rate constant has an upper limit of k2 â¤ ~1010 Mâ1sâ1.
For a termolecular step
      A + B + C â P
the reaction rate is described by     r =  k  3   [  A  ] [  B  ] [  C  ]
{\displaystyle r=k_{3}[\mathrm {A} ][\mathrm {B} ][\mathrm {C} ]}  [
{\displaystyle r=k_{3}[\mathrm {A} ][\mathrm {B} ][\mathrm {C} ]}], where
k  3     {\displaystyle k_{3}}  [k_{3}] is a termolecular rate constant.
There are few examples of elementary steps that are termolecular or higher
order, due to the low probability of three or more molecules colliding in their
reactive conformations and in the right orientation relative to each other to
reach a particular transition state.[2] There are, however, some termolecular
examples in the gas phase. Most involve the recombination of two atoms or small
radicals or molecules in the presence of an inert third body which carries off
excess energy, such as O + O2 + N2 â O3 + N2. One well-established example is
the termolecular step 2 I + H2 â 2 HI in the hydrogen-iodine_reaction.[3][4]
[5] In cases where a termolecular step might plausibly be proposed, one of the
reactants is generally present in high concentration (e.g., as a solvent or
diluent gas).[6]
***** Relationship to other parameters[edit] *****
For a first-order reaction (including a unimolecular one-step process), there
is a direct relationship between the unimolecular rate constant and the half-
life of the reaction:      t  1  /  2   =    ln &#x2061; 2  k
{\displaystyle t_{1/2}={\frac {\ln 2}{k}}}  [{\displaystyle t_{1/2}={\frac {\ln
2}{k}}}]. Transition state theory gives a relationship between the rate
constant and the Gibbs free energy of activation, a quantity that can be
regarded as the free energy change needed to reach the transition state. In
particular, this energy barrier incorporates both enthalpic and entropic
changes that need to be achieved for the reaction to take place:     k ( T ) =
k   B    T  h    e  &#x2212; &#x0394;  G  &#x2021;    /  R T     {\displaystyle
k(T)={\frac {k_{\mathrm {B} }T}{h}}e^{-\Delta G^{\ddagger }/RT}}  [
{\displaystyle k(T)={\frac {k_{\mathrm {B} }T}{h}}e^{-\Delta G^{\ddagger }/
RT}}]. As useful rules of thumb, a first-order reaction with a rate constant of
10â4 sâ1 will have a half-life (t1/2) of approximately 2 hours. For a one-
step process taking place at room temperature, the corresponding Gibbs free
energy of activation (ÎGâ¡) is approximately 23 kcal/mol.
***** Temperature dependence[edit] *****
The Arrhenius_equation is an elementary treatment that gives the quantitative
basis of the relationship between the activation_energy and the reaction_rate
at which a reaction proceeds. The rate constant as a function of thermodynamic
temperature is then given by
         k ( T ) = A  e  &#x2212;  E   a     /  R T     {\displaystyle k(T)=Ae^
      {-E_{\mathrm {a} }/RT}}  [{\displaystyle k(T)=Ae^{-E_{\mathrm {a} }/RT}}]
and the reaction rate by
         r = A  e  &#x2212;  E   a     /  R T   [  A   ]  m   [  B   ]  n   ,
      {\displaystyle r=Ae^{-E_{\mathrm {a} }/RT}[\mathrm {A} ]^{m}[\mathrm {B}
      ]^{n},}  [{\displaystyle r=Ae^{-E_{\mathrm {a} }/RT}[\mathrm {A} ]^{m}
      [\mathrm {B} ]^{n},}]
where Ea is the activation_energy, and R is the gas_constant, and m and n are
experimentally determined partial orders in [A] and [B], respectively. Since at
temperature T the molecules have energies according to a Boltzmann
distribution, one can expect the proportion of collisions with energy greater
than Ea to vary with e&#x200b;âEa⁄RT. The constant of proportionality A is
the pre-exponential_factor, or frequency factor (not to be confused here with
the reactant A) takes into consideration the frequency at which reactant
molecules are colliding and the likelihood that a collision leads to a
successful reaction. Here, A has the same dimensions as an (m + n)-order rate
constant (see Units below).
Another popular model that is derived using more sophisticated statistical
mechanical considerations is the Eyring_equation from transition_state_theory:
         k ( T ) = &#x03BA;     k   B    T  h   (  c  &#x2296;    )  1 &#x2212;
      M    e  &#x2212; &#x0394;  G  &#x2021;    /  R T   =  (  &#x03BA;     k
      B    T  h   (  c  &#x2296;    )  1 &#x2212; M    )   e  &#x0394;  S
      &#x2021;    /  R    e  &#x2212; &#x0394;  H  &#x2021;    /  R T
      {\displaystyle k(T)=\kappa {\frac {k_{\mathrm {B} }T}{h}}(c^{\ominus })^
      {1-M}e^{-\Delta G^{\ddagger }/RT}=\left(\kappa {\frac {k_{\mathrm {B} }T}
      {h}}(c^{\ominus })^{1-M}\right)e^{\Delta S^{\ddagger }/R}e^{-\Delta H^
      {\ddagger }/RT}}  [{\displaystyle k(T)=\kappa {\frac {k_{\mathrm {B} }T}
      {h}}(c^{\ominus })^{1-M}e^{-\Delta G^{\ddagger }/RT}=\left(\kappa {\frac
      {k_{\mathrm {B} }T}{h}}(c^{\ominus })^{1-M}\right)e^{\Delta S^{\ddagger
      }/R}e^{-\Delta H^{\ddagger }/RT}}],
where ÎGâ¡ is the free energy of activation, a parameter that incorporates
both the enthalpy and entropy change needed to reach the transition state. The
temperature dependence of ÎGâ¡ is used to compute these parameters, the
enthalpy of activation ÎHâ¡ and the entropy of activation ÎSâ¡, based on
the defining formula ÎGâ¡ = ÎHâ¡ â TÎSâ¡. In effect, the free energy of
activation takes into account both the activation energy and the likelihood of
successful collision, while the factor kBT/h gives the frequency of molecular
collision.
The factor (câ)1-M ensures the dimensional correctness of the rate constant
when the transition state in question is bimolecular or higher. Here, câ is
the standard concentration, generally chosen based on the unit of concentration
used (usually câ = 1 mol Lâ1 = 1 M), and M is the molecularity of the
transition state. Lastly, Îº, usually set to unity, is known as the
transmission_coefficient, a parameter which essentially serves as a "fudge
factor" for transition state theory.
The biggest difference between the two theories is that Arrhenius theory
attempts to model the reaction (single- or multi-step) as a whole, while
transition state theory models the individual elementary steps involved. Thus,
they are not directly comparable, unless the reaction in question involves only
a single elementary step.
Finally, in the past, collision_theory, in which reactants are viewed as hard
spheres with a particular cross-section, provided yet another common way to
rationalize and model the temperature dependence of the rate constant, although
this approach has gradually fallen into disuse. The equation for the rate
constant is similar in functional form to both the Arrhenius and Eyring
equations:
         k ( T ) = P Z  e  &#x2212; &#x0394; E  /  R T     {\displaystyle k
      (T)=PZe^{-\Delta E/RT}}  [{\displaystyle k(T)=PZe^{-\Delta E/RT}}],
where P is the steric (or probability) factor and Z is the collision frequency,
and ÎE is energy input required to overcome the activation barrier. Of note,
Z &#x221D;  T  1  /  2     {\displaystyle Z\propto T^{1/2}}  [{\displaystyle
Z\propto T^{1/2}}], making the temperature dependence of k different from both
the Arrhenius and Eyring models.
**** Comparison of models[edit] ****
All three theories model the temperature dependence of k using an equation of
the form
         k ( T ) = C  T  &#x03B1;    e  &#x2212; &#x0394; E  /  R T
      {\displaystyle k(T)=CT^{\alpha }e^{-\Delta E/RT}}  [{\displaystyle k
      (T)=CT^{\alpha }e^{-\Delta E/RT}}]
for some constant C, where Î± = 0, Â½, and 1 give Arrhenius theory, collision
theory, and transition state theory, respectively, although the imprecise
notion of ÎE, the energy needed to overcome the activation barrier, has a
slightly different meaning in each theory. In practice, experimental data does
not generally allow a determination to be made as to which is "correct" in
terms of best fit. Hence, it must be remembered that all three are conceptual
frameworks that make numerous assumptions, both realistic and unrealistic, in
their derivations. As a result, they are capable of providing different
insights into a system.[7]
***** Units[edit] *****
The units of the rate constant depend on the global order_of_reaction:[8] If
concentration is measured in units of molÂ·Lâ1 (sometimes abbreviated as M),
then
    * For order (m + n), the rate constant has units of mol1â(m+n)Â·L
      (m+n)â1Â·sâ1
    * For order zero, the rate constant has units of molÂ·Lâ1Â·sâ1 (or
      MÂ·sâ1)
    * For order one, the rate constant has units of sâ1
    * For order two, the rate constant has units of LÂ·molâ1Â·sâ1 (or
      Mâ1Â·sâ1)
    * And for order three, the rate constant has units of L2Â·molâ2Â·sâ1
      (or Mâ2Â·sâ1)
***** Plasma and gases[edit] *****
Calculation of rate constants of the processes of generation and relaxation of
electronically and vibrationally excited particles are of significant
importance. It is used, for example, in the computer simulation of processes in
plasma_chemistry or microelectronics. First-principle based models should be
used for such calculation. It can be done with the help of computer_simulation
software.
***** Rate constant calculations[edit] *****
Rate constant can be calculated for elementary reactions by molecular dynamics
simulations. One possible approach is to calculate the mean residence time of
the molecule in the reactant state. Although this is feasible for small systems
with short residence times, this approach is not widely applicable as reactions
are often rare events on molecular scale. One simple approach to overcome this
problem is Divided Saddle Theory.[9] Such other methods as the Bennett Chandler
procedure,[10][11] and Milestoning[12] are also developed for rate constant
calculations.
***** Divided saddle theory[edit] *****
The theory is based on the assumption that the reaction can be described by a
reaction coordinate, and that we can apply Boltzmann distribution at least in
the reactant state. A new, especially reactive segment of the reactant, called
the saddle domain, is introduced, and the rate constant is factored:
         k =  k   S D    &#x22C5;  &#x03B1;   R S     S D      {\displaystyle
      k=k_{\mathrm {SD} }\cdot \alpha _{\mathrm {RS} }^{\mathrm {SD} }}  [
      {\displaystyle k=k_{\mathrm {SD} }\cdot \alpha _{\mathrm {RS} }^{\mathrm
      {SD} }}]
where Î±SD
RS is the conversion factor between the reactant state and saddle domain, while
kSD is the rate constant from the saddle domain. The first can be simply
calculated from the free energy surface, the latter is easily accessible from
short molecular dynamics simulations [9]
