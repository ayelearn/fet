study of rates of chemical processes
Chemical kinetics, also known as reaction kinetics, is the branch of physical
chemistry that is concerned with understanding the rates of chemical reactions.
It is to be contrasted with thermodynamics, which deals with the direction in
which a process occurs but in itself tells nothing about its rate. Chemical
kinetics includes investigations of how different experimental conditions can
influence the speed of a chemical_reaction and yield information about the
reaction's_mechanism and transition_states, as well as the construction of
mathematical_models that also can describe the characteristics of a chemical
reaction.

***** History[edit] *****
In 1864, Peter_Waage and Cato_Guldberg pioneered the development of chemical
kinetics by formulating the law_of_mass_action, which states that the speed of
a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of the reacting substances.
[1][2][3]
Van_'t_Hoff studied chemical dynamics and in 1884 published his famous "Ãtudes
de dynamique chimique".[4] In 1901 he was awarded by the first Nobel Prize in
Chemistry "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the
discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions".
[5] After van 't Hoff, chemical kinetics deals with the experimental
determination of reaction_rates from which rate_laws and rate_constants are
derived. Relatively simple rate_laws exist for zero_order_reactions (for which
reaction rates are independent of concentration), first_order_reactions, and
second_order_reactions, and can be derived for others. Elementary_reactions
follow the law_of_mass_action, but the rate law of stepwise_reactions has to be
derived by combining the rate laws of the various elementary steps, and can
become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining_step
often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first order reactions, a steady
state approximation can simplify the rate_law. The activation_energy for a
reaction is experimentally determined through the Arrhenius_equation and the
Eyring_equation. The main factors that influence the reaction_rate include: the
physical_state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the
temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are
present in the reaction.
Gorban and Yablonsky have suggested that the history of chemical dynamics can
be divided into three eras.[6] The first is the van 't Hoff wave searching for
the general laws of chemical reactions and relating kinetics to thermodynamics.
The second may be called the Semenov--Hinshelwood wave with emphasis on
reaction mechanisms, especially for chain_reactions. The third is associated
with Aris and the detailed mathematical description of chemical reaction
networks.
***** Factors affecting reaction rate[edit] *****
**** Nature of the reactants[edit] ****
The reaction rate varies depending upon what substances are reacting. Acid/base
reactions, the formation of salts, and ion_exchange are usually fast reactions.
When covalent bond formation takes place between the molecules and when large
molecules are formed, the reactions tend to be slower.
The nature and strength of bonds in reactant molecules greatly influence the
rate of their transformation into products.
**** Physical state[edit] ****
The physical_state (solid, liquid, or gas) of a reactant is also an important
factor of the rate of change. When reactants are in the same phase, as in
aqueous solution, thermal motion brings them into contact. However, when they
are in different phases, the reaction is limited to the interface between the
reactants. Reaction can occur only at their area of contact; in the case of a
liquid and a gas, at the surface of the liquid. Vigorous shaking and stirring
may be needed to bring the reaction to completion. This means that the more
finely divided a solid or liquid reactant the greater its surface_area per unit
volume and the more contact it with the other reactant, thus the faster the
reaction. To make an analogy, for example, when one starts a fire, one uses
wood chips and small branches â one does not start with large logs right
away. In organic chemistry, on_water_reactions are the exception to the rule
that homogeneous reactions take place faster than heterogeneous reactions.
**** Surface area of solids[edit] ****
In a solid, only those particles that are at the surface can be involved in a
reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are
present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and
reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example,
Sherbet_(powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic_acid (a weak organic
acid) and sodium_hydrogen_carbonate. On contact with the saliva in the mouth,
these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon_dioxide and
providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the
surface area of solid reactants to control the rate at which the fuels in
fireworks are oxidised, using this to create different effects. For example,
finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger
pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as
pieces of burning metal are ejected.
**** Concentration[edit] ****
Main article: Rate_equation
The reactions are due to collisions of reactant species. The frequency with
which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their concentrations. The more
crowded the molecules are, the more likely they are to collide and react with
one another. Thus, an increase in the concentrations of the reactants will
usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a
decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example,
combustion will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen).
The rate_equation shows the detailed dependence of the reaction rate on the
concentrations of reactants and other species present. Different mathematical
forms are possible depending on the reaction_mechanism. The actual rate
equation for a given reaction is determined experimentally and provides
information about the reaction mechanism. The mathematical expression of the
rate equation is often given by
         v =     d  c    d  t    = k  &#x220F;  i    c  i    m  i
      {\displaystyle v={\frac {\mathrm {d} c}{\mathrm {d} t}}=k\prod _{i}c_{i}^
      {m_{i}}}  [{\displaystyle v={\frac {\mathrm {d} c}{\mathrm {d} t}}=k\prod
      _{i}c_{i}^{m_{i}}}]
Here     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] is the reaction_rate_constant,      c  i
{\displaystyle c_{i}}  [c_{i}] is the molar concentration of reactant i and
m  i     {\displaystyle m_{i}}  [m_{i}] is the partial order of reaction for
this reactant. The partial_order for a reactant can only be determined
experimentally and is often different from its stoichiometric_coefficient.
**** Temperature[edit] ****
Main article: Arrhenius_equation
Temperature usually has a major effect on the rate of a chemical reaction.
Molecules at a higher temperature have more thermal_energy. Although collision
frequency is greater at higher temperatures, this alone contributes only a very
small proportion to the increase in rate of reaction. Much more important is
the fact that the proportion of reactant molecules with sufficient energy to
react (energy greater than activation_energy: E > Ea) is significantly higher
and is explained in detail by the Maxwell–Boltzmann_distribution of molecular
energies.
The 'rule of thumb' that the rate of chemical reactions doubles for every
10 Â°C temperature rise is a common misconception. This may have been
generalized from the special case of biological systems, where the Î±_
(temperature_coefficient) is often between 1.5 and 2.5.
A reaction's kinetics can also be studied with a temperature_jump approach.
This involves using a sharp rise in temperature and observing the relaxation
time of the return to equilibrium. A particularly useful form of temperature
jump apparatus is a shock_tube, which can rapidly jump a gas's temperature by
more than 1000 degrees.
**** Catalysts[edit] ****
Main article: Catalysis
Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in a
hypothetical endothermic chemical reaction. The presence of the catalyst opens
a different reaction pathway (shown in red) with a lower activation energy. The
final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same.
A catalyst is a substance that alters the rate of a chemical reaction but
remains chemically unchanged afterwards. The catalyst increases the rate of the
reaction by providing a different reaction_mechanism to occur with a lower
activation_energy. In autocatalysis a reaction product is itself a catalyst for
that reaction leading to positive_feedback. Proteins that act as catalysts in
biochemical reactions are called enzymes. MichaelisâMenten_kinetics describe
the rate_of_enzyme_mediated_reactions. A catalyst does not affect the position
of the equilibrium, as the catalyst speeds up the backward and forward
reactions equally.
In certain organic molecules, specific substituents can have an influence on
reaction rate in neighbouring_group_participation.[citation_needed]
**** Pressure[edit] ****
Increasing the pressure in a gaseous reaction will increase the number of
collisions between reactants, increasing the rate of reaction. This is because
the activity of a gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the
gas. This is similar to the effect of increasing the concentration of a
solution.
In addition to this straightforward mass-action effect, the rate coefficients
themselves can change due to pressure. The rate coefficients and products of
many high-temperature gas-phase reactions change if an inert gas is added to
the mixture; variations on this effect are called fall-off and chemical
activation. These phenomena are due to exothermic or endothermic reactions
occurring faster than heat transfer, causing the reacting molecules to have
non-thermal energy distributions (non-Boltzmann_distribution). Increasing the
pressure increases the heat transfer rate between the reacting molecules and
the rest of the system, reducing this effect.
Condensed-phase rate coefficients can also be affected by (very high) pressure;
this is a completely different effect than fall-off or chemical-activation. It
is often studied using diamond_anvils.
A reaction's kinetics can also be studied with a pressure_jump approach. This
involves making fast changes in pressure and observing the relaxation_time of
the return to equilibrium.
**** Absorption of light[edit] ****
The activation energy for a chemical reaction can be provided when one reactant
molecule absorbs light of suitable wavelength and is promoted to an excited
state. The study of reactions initiated by light is photochemistry, one
prominent example being photosynthesis.
***** Experimental methods[edit] *****
The Spinco Division Model 260 Reaction Kinetics System measured the precise
rate constants of molecular reactions.
The experimental determination of reaction rates involves measuring how the
concentrations of reactants or products change over time. For example, the
concentration of a reactant can be measured by spectrophotometry at a
wavelength where no other reactant or product in the system absorbs light.
For reactions which take at least several minutes, it is possible to start the
observations after the reactants have been mixed at the temperature of
interest.
**** Fast reactions[edit] ****
For faster reactions, the time required to mix the reactants and bring them to
a specified temperature may be comparable or longer than the half-life of the
reaction.[7] Special methods to start fast reactions without slow mixing step
include
    * Stopped_flow methods, which can reduce the mixing time to the order of a
      millisecond[7][8][9]
    * Chemical_relaxation methods such as temperature_jump and pressure_jump,
      in which a pre-mixed system initially at equilibrium is perturbed by
      rapid heating or depressurization so that it is no longer at equilibrium,
      and the relaxation back to equilibrium is observed.[7][10][11][12] For
      example, this method has been used to study the neutralization H3O+ +
      OHâ with a half-life of 1 Î¼s or less under ordinary conditions.[7][12]
    * Flash_photolysis, in which a laser pulse produces highly excited species
      such as free_radicals, whose reactions are then studied.[9][13][14][15]
***** Equilibrium[edit] *****
While chemical kinetics is concerned with the rate of a chemical reaction,
thermodynamics determines the extent to which reactions occur. In a reversible
reaction, chemical equilibrium is reached when the rates of the forward and
reverse reactions are equal [the principle of dynamic_equilibrium ] and the
concentrations of the reactants and Products no longer change. This is
demonstrated by, for example, the Haber–Bosch_process for combining nitrogen
and hydrogen to produce ammonia. Chemical_clock reactions such as the
Belousov–Zhabotinsky_reaction demonstrate that component concentrations can
oscillate for a long time before finally attaining the equilibrium.
***** Free energy[edit] *****
In general terms, the free_energy_change_(ÎG) of a reaction determines whether
a chemical change will take place, but kinetics describes how fast the reaction
is. A reaction can be very exothermic and have a very positive entropy change
but will not happen in practice if the reaction is too slow. If a reactant can
produce two different products, the thermodynamically most stable one will in
general form, except in special circumstances when the reaction is said to be
under kinetic_reaction_control. The Curtin–Hammett_principle applies when
determining the product ratio for two reactants interconverting rapidly, each
going to a different product. It is possible to make predictions about reaction
rate constants for a reaction from free-energy_relationships.
The kinetic_isotope_effect is the difference in the rate of a chemical reaction
when an atom in one of the reactants is replaced by one of its isotopes.
Chemical kinetics provides information on residence_time and heat_transfer in a
chemical_reactor in chemical_engineering and the molar_mass_distribution in
polymer_chemistry. It is also provides information in corrosion_engineering.
***** Applications and models[edit] *****
The mathematical models that describe chemical reaction kinetics provide
chemists and chemical engineers with tools to better understand and describe
chemical processes such as food decomposition, microorganism growth,
stratospheric ozone decomposition, and the chemistry of biological systems.
These models can also be used in the design or modification of chemical
reactors to optimize product yield, more efficiently separate products, and
eliminate environmentally harmful by-products. When performing catalytic
cracking of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline and light gas, for example,
kinetic models can be used to find the temperature and pressure at which the
highest yield of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline will occur.
Chemical Kinetics is frequently validated and explored through modeling in
specialized packages as a function of ordinary_differential_equation-solving
(ODE-solving) and curve-fitting.[16]
