***** Management science[edit] *****
In work place, performance or job performance means good ranking with the
hypothesized conception of requirements of a role. There are two types of job
performances: contextual and task. Task performance is related to cognitive
ability while contextual performance is dependent upon personality.[2] Task
performance are behavioral roles that are recognized in job descriptions and by
remuneration systems, they are directly related to organizational performance,
whereas, contextual performance are value based and additional behavioral roles
that are not recognized in job descriptions and covered by compensation; they
are extra roles that are indirectly related to organizational performance.[3]
Citizenship performance like contextual performance means a set of individual
activity/contribution (prosocial organizational behavior) that supports the
organizational_culture.[4][5]
***** Arts[edit] *****
In the performing_arts, a performance generally comprises an event in which a
performer or group of performers present one or more works_of_art to an
audience. In instrumental music (and in drama), performance is typically
described as "play".[6] Usually the performers participate in rehearsals
beforehand.
An effective performance is determined by achievement skills and competency of
the performer - level of skill and knowledge. Spencer and McClelland in 1994
defined competency as "a combination of motives, traits, self-concepts,
attitudes, cognitive behavior skills (content knowledge)" that helps a
performer to differentiate themselves superior from average performers.[7] A
performance may also describe the way in which an actor performs. In a solo
capacity, it may also refer to a mime_artist, comedian, conjurer, or other
entertainer.
***** Performance state[edit] *****
English rock band Deep_Purple performing in Hoyos_del_Espino, Spain (2013)
Williams and Krane found the following characteristics define an ideal
performance state:[8]
    * Absence of fear
    * Not thinking about the performance
    * Adaptive focus on the activity
    * A sense of effortlessness and belief in confidence or self-efficacy
    * A sense of personal control
    * A distortion of time and space where time does not affect the activity
Other related factors are motivation to achieve success or avoid failure, task
relevant attention, positive self-talk and cognitive regulation to achieve
automaticity. Performance is also dependent on adaptation of eight areas:
Handling crisis, managing stress, creative problem solving, knowing necessary
functional tools and skills, agile management of complex processes,
interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical fitness.[9]
Performance is not always a result of practice, it is about honing the skill,
even over practice itself can result in failure due to ego_depletion.[10]
**** Stage fright[edit] ****
Kristin_Chenoweth performs the national anthem of the United States at a
baseball game
Theatrical performances, especially when the audience is limited to only a few
observers, can lead to significant increases in the performer's heart rate
above his or her baseline heart rate. This increase takes place in several
stages relative to the performance itself, including anticipatory activation
(one minute before the start of subject's speaking role), confrontation
activation (during the subject's speaking role, at which point their heart rate
peaks) and release period (one minute after the conclusion of the subject's
speech).[11] The same physiological reactions can be experienced in other
mediums, such as instrumental performance. When experiments were conducted to
determine whether there was a correlation between audience size and heart rate
(an indicator of anxiety) of instrumental performers, the researcher's findings
ran contrary to previous studies, showing a positive correlation rather than a
negative one.[12]
Heart rate shares a strong, positive correlation with the self reported anxiety
of performers.[13] Other physiological responses to public performance include
perspiration, secretion of the adrenal_glands, and increased blood pressure.
