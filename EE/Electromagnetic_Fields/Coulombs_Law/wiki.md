Coulomb's law, or Coulomb's inverse-square law, is an experimental law[1] of
physics that quantifies the amount of force between two stationary,
electrically_charged particles. The electric force between charged bodies at
rest is conventionally called electrostatic force[2] or Coulomb force.[3] The
quantity of electrostatic force between stationary charges is always described
by Coulomb's law.[4] The law was first published in 1785 by French physicist
Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb, and was essential to the development of the theory
of_electromagnetism, maybe even its starting point,[5] because it was now
possible to discuss quantity of electric charge in a meaningful way.[6]
In its scalar form, the law is:
         F =  k  e       q  1    q  2     r  2     ,   {\displaystyle F=k_{e}
      {\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}},}  [{\displaystyle F=k_{e}{\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}
      {r^{2}}},}]
where ke is Coulomb's_constant (ke â 9Ã109 Nâm2âCâ2),[7] q1 and q2 are
the signed magnitudes of the charges, and the scalar r is the distance between
the charges. The force of the interaction between the charges is attractive if
the charges have opposite signs (i.e., F is negative) and repulsive if like-
signed (i.e., F is positive).
Being an inverse-square_law, the law is analogous to Isaac_Newton's inverse-
square law_of_universal_gravitation, but gravitational forces are always
attractive, while electrostatic forces can be attractive or repulsive.[8]
Coulomb's law can be used to derive Gauss's_law, and vice versa. The two laws
are equivalent, expressing the same physical law in different ways.[9] The law
has been tested_extensively, and observations have upheld the law on a scale
from 10â16 m to 108 m.[10]

***** History[edit] *****
Charles-Augustin de Coulomb
Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as
rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like
feathers and papers. Thales_of_Miletus made a series of observations on static
electricity around 600 BC, from which he believed that friction rendered amber
magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.
[11][12] Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic
effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity.
Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for
millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William_Gilbert made a careful
study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from
static_electricity produced by rubbing amber.[11] He coined the New_Latin word
electricus ("of amber" or "like amber", from á¼¤Î»ÎµÎºÏÏÎ¿Î½ [elektron], the
Greek word for "amber") to refer to the property of attracting small objects
after being rubbed.[13] This association gave rise to the English words
"electric" and "electricity", which made their first appearance in print in
Thomas_Browne's Pseudodoxia_Epidemica of 1646.[14]
Early investigators of the 18th century who suspected that the electrical force
diminished with distance as the force of gravity did (i.e., as the inverse
square of the distance) included Daniel_Bernoulli[15] and Alessandro_Volta,
both of whom measured the force between plates of a capacitor, and Franz
Aepinus who supposed the inverse-square law in 1758.[16]
Based on experiments with electrically_charged spheres, Joseph_Priestley of
England was among the first to propose that electrical force followed an
inverse-square_law, similar to Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation. However,
he did not generalize or elaborate on this.[17] In 1767, he conjectured that
the force between charges varied as the inverse square of the distance.[18][19]
Coulomb's torsion_balance
In 1769, Scottish physicist John_Robison announced that, according to his
measurements, the force of repulsion between two spheres with charges of the
same sign varied as xâ2.06.[20]
In the early 1770s, the dependence of the force between charged bodies upon
both distance and charge had already been discovered, but not published, by
Henry_Cavendish of England.[21]
Finally, in 1785, the French physicist Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb published
his first three reports of electricity and magnetism where he stated his law.
This publication was essential to the development of the theory_of
electromagnetism.[22] He used a torsion_balance to study the repulsion and
attraction forces of charged_particles, and determined that the magnitude of
the electric force between two point_charges is directly proportional to the
product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between them.
The torsion balance consists of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin
fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak torsion_spring. In Coulomb's experiment,
the torsion balance was an insulating rod with a metal-coated ball attached to
one end, suspended by a silk thread. The ball was charged with a known charge
of static_electricity, and a second charged ball of the same polarity was
brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber
through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the instrument. By
knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle,
Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls and derive his
inverse-square proportionality law.
***** The law[edit] *****
Coulomb's law states that:
     The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion
     between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of
     the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of
     the distance between them.[22]
     The force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges
     have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is
     repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is
     attractive.
[A_graphical_representation_of_Coulomb's_law]
Coulomb's law can also be stated as a simple mathematical expression. The
scalar and vector forms of the mathematical equation are
          |   F   |  =  k  e       |   q  1    q  2    |    r  2
      {\displaystyle |\mathbf {F} |=k_{e}{|q_{1}q_{2}| \over r^{2}}\qquad }
      [|\mathbf F|=k_e{|q_1q_2|\over r^2}\qquad] and        F   1   =  k  e
      q  1    q  2       |    r   21    |    2         r &#x005E;     21   ,
      {\displaystyle \qquad \mathbf {F} _{1}=k_{e}{\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{{|\mathbf
      {r} _{21}|}^{2}}}\mathbf {\widehat {r}} _{21},\qquad }  [{\displaystyle
      \qquad \mathbf {F} _{1}=k_{e}{\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{{|\mathbf {r} _{21}|}^
      {2}}}\mathbf {\widehat {r}} _{21},\qquad }] respectively,
where ke is Coulomb's_constant (ke = 8.9875517873681764Ã109 Nâm2âCâ2),
q1 and q2 are the signed magnitudes of the charges, the scalar r is the
distance between the charges, the vector r21 = r1 â r2 is the vectorial
distance between the charges, and rÌ21 = r21/|r21| (a unit vector pointing
from q2 to q1). The vector form of the equation calculates the force F1 applied
on q1 by q2. If r12 is used instead, then the effect on q2 can be found. It can
be also calculated using Newton's_third_law: F2 = âF1.
**** Units[edit] ****
When the electromagnetic_theory is expressed in the International_System_of
Units, force is measured in newtons, charge in coulombs, and distance in
meters. Coulomb's constant is given by ke = 1/4ÏÎµ0. The constant Îµ0 is the
vacuum_electric_permittivity (also known as "electric constant") [23] in
C2âmâ2âNâ1. It should not be confused with Îµr, which is the
dimensionless relative_permittivity of the material in which the charges are
immersed, or with their product Îµa = Îµ0Îµr , which is called "absolute
permittivity of the material" and is still used in electrical_engineering.
The SI_derived_units for the electric field are volts per meter, newtons per
coulomb, or tesla meters per second.
Coulomb's law and Coulomb's_constant can also be interpreted in various terms:
    * Atomic_units. In atomic units the force is expressed in hartrees per Bohr
      radius, the charge in terms of the elementary_charge, and the distances
      in terms of the Bohr radius.
    * Electrostatic_units or Gaussian_units. In electrostatic units and
      Gaussian units, the unit charge (esu or statcoulomb) is defined in such a
      way that the Coulomb constant k disappears because it has the value of
      one and becomes dimensionless.
    * LorentzâHeaviside_units (also called rationalized). In
      LorentzâHeaviside units the Coulomb constant is ke = 1/4ÏÎµ0 and
      becomes dimensionless.
Gaussian_units and LorentzâHeaviside_units are both CGS_unit_systems.
Gaussian units are more amenable for microscopic problems such as the
electrodynamics of individual electrically charged particles.[24] SI units are
more convenient for practical, large-scale phenomena, such as engineering
applications.[24]

Main article: Electric_field
If two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is
repulsive; if they have different sign, the force between them is attractive.
An electric field is a vector_field that associates to each point in space the
Coulomb force experienced by a test_charge. In the simplest case, the field is
considered to be generated solely by a single source point_charge. The strength
and direction of the Coulomb force F on a test charge qt depends on the
electric field E that it finds itself in, such that F = qtE. If the field is
generated by a positive source point charge q, the direction of the electric
field points along lines directed radially outwards from it, i.e. in the
direction that a positive point test charge qt would move if placed in the
field. For a negative point source charge, the direction is radially inwards.
The magnitude of the electric field E can be derived from Coulomb's_law. By
choosing one of the point charges to be the source, and the other to be the
test charge, it follows from Coulomb's law that the magnitude of the electric
field E created by a single source point_charge q at a certain distance from it
r in vacuum is given by:
          |   E   |  =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0          |  q  |    r  2
      {\displaystyle |{\boldsymbol {E}}|={1 \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}{|q|
      \over r^{2}}}  [|\boldsymbol{E}|={1\over4\pi\varepsilon_0}{|q|\over r^2}]
**** Coulomb's constant[edit] ****
Main article: Coulomb's_constant
Coulomb's constant is a proportionality factor that appears in Coulomb's law as
well as in other electric-related formulas. The value of this constant is
dependent upon the medium that the charged objects are immersed in. Denoted ke,
it is also called the electric force constant or electrostatic constant,[8]
hence the subscript e.
The exact value of Coulomb's constant in the case of air or vacuum is:
              k  e      =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0      =     c  0   2

There are three conditions to be fulfilled for the validity of Coulomb's law:
   1. The charges must have a spherically symmetric distribution (e.g. be point
      charges, or a charged metal sphere).
   2. The charges must not overlap (e.g. they must be distinct point charges).
   3. The charges must be stationary with respect to each other.
The last of these is known as the electrostatic_approximation. When movement
takes place, Einstein's theory_of_relativity must be taken into consideration,
and a result, an extra factor is introduced, which alters the force produced on
the two objects. This extra part of the force is called the magnetic force, and
is described by magnetic_fields. For slow movement, the magnetic force is
minimal and Coulomb's law can still be considered approximately correct, but
when the charges are moving more quickly in relation to each other, the full
electrodynamic rules (incorporating the magnetic force) must be considered.

The most basic Feynman diagram for QED interaction between two fermions
In simple terms, the Coulomb_potential derives from the QED Lagrangian as
follows. The Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics is normally written in
natural_units, but in SI units, it is:
            L     Q E D    =    &#x03C8; &#x00AF;    ( i &#x210F; c  &#x03B3;
      &#x03BC;    D  &#x03BC;   &#x2212; m  c  2   ) &#x03C8; &#x2212;   1  4
      &#x210F; c     F  &#x03BC; &#x03BD;    F  &#x03BC; &#x03BD;
      {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\mathrm {QED} }={\bar {\psi }}(i\hbar
      c\gamma ^{\mu }D_{\mu }-mc^{2})\psi -{\frac {1}{4\hbar c}}F_{\mu \nu }F^
      {\mu \nu }}  [{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\mathrm {QED} }={\bar {\psi
      }}(i\hbar c\gamma ^{\mu }D_{\mu }-mc^{2})\psi -{\frac {1}{4\hbar c}}F_
      {\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu }}]
where the covariant derivative (in SI units) is:
           D   &#x03BC;   =  &#x2202;  &#x03BC;   +    i g   &#x210F; c     A
      &#x03BC;     {\displaystyle {D}_{\mu }=\partial _{\mu }+{\frac {ig}{\hbar
      c}}A_{\mu }}  [{\displaystyle {D}_{\mu }=\partial _{\mu }+{\frac {ig}
      {\hbar c}}A_{\mu }}]
where     g   {\displaystyle g}  [g] is the gauge_coupling_parameter. By
putting the covariant derivative into the lagrangian explicitly, the
interaction term (the term involving both     A   {\displaystyle A}  [A] and
&#x03C8;   {\displaystyle \psi }  [\psi ]) is seen to be:
            L     i n t    = i g    &#x03C8; &#x00AF;     &#x03B3;  &#x03BC;
      A  &#x03BC;   &#x03C8;   {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\mathrm {int}
      }=ig{\bar {\psi }}\gamma ^{\mu }A_{\mu }\psi }  [{\displaystyle {\mathcal
      {L}}_{\mathrm {int} }=ig{\bar {\psi }}\gamma ^{\mu }A_{\mu }\psi }]
The most basic Feynman_diagram for a QED interaction between two fermions is
the exchange of a single photon, with no loops. Following the Feynman_rules,
this therefore contributes two QED vertex factors (    i g Q  &#x03B3;
&#x03BC;     {\displaystyle igQ\gamma _{\mu }}  [{\displaystyle igQ\gamma _{\mu
}}]) to the potential, where Q is the QED-charge_operator (Q gives the charge
in terms of the electron charge, and hence is exactly â1 for electrons,
etc.). For the photon in the diagram, the Feynman rules demand the contribution
of one bosonic massless propagator      (    &#x210F; c   k  2     )
{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\hbar c}{k^{2}}}\right)}  [{\displaystyle \left(
{\frac {\hbar c}{k^{2}}}\right)}]. Ignoring the momentum on the external legs
(the fermions), the potential is therefore:
         V (  r  ) =   1  ( 2 &#x03C0;  )  3      &#x222B;  e    i  k &#x22C5;
      r   &#x210F;    ( i  Q  1    g  2    &#x03B3;  &#x03BC;   ) ( i  Q  2
      g  2    &#x03B3;  &#x03BD;   )  (    &#x210F; c   k  2     )    d  3   k
      {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{3}}}\int e^{\frac
      {i\mathbf {k\cdot r} }{\hbar }}(iQ_{1}g^{2}\gamma _{\mu })(iQ_{2}g^
      {2}\gamma _{\nu })\left({\frac {\hbar c}{k^{2}}}\right)\;d^{3}k}  [
      {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{3}}}\int e^{\frac
      {i\mathbf {k\cdot r} }{\hbar }}(iQ_{1}g^{2}\gamma _{\mu })(iQ_{2}g^
      {2}\gamma _{\nu })\left({\frac {\hbar c}{k^{2}}}\right)\;d^{3}k}]
which can be more usefully written as
         V (  r  ) =    &#x2212;  g  2   &#x210F; c  Q  1    Q  2     4
      &#x03C0;      1  ( 2 &#x03C0;  )  3      &#x222B;  e    i  k &#x22C5; r
      &#x210F;       4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B7;  &#x03BC; &#x03BD;     k  2       d
      3   k   {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {-g^{2}\hbar cQ_{1}Q_{2}}
      {4\pi }}{\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{3}}}\int e^{\frac {i\mathbf {k\cdot r} }
      {\hbar }}{\frac {4\pi \eta _{\mu \nu }}{k^{2}}}\;d^{3}k}  [{\displaystyle
      V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {-g^{2}\hbar cQ_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi }}{\frac {1}{(2\pi
      )^{3}}}\int e^{\frac {i\mathbf {k\cdot r} }{\hbar }}{\frac {4\pi \eta _
      {\mu \nu }}{k^{2}}}\;d^{3}k}]
where      Q  i     {\displaystyle Q_{i}}  [Q_{i}] is the QED-charge on the ith
particle. Recognising the integral as just being a Fourier_transform enables
the equation to be simplified:
         V (  r  ) =    &#x2212;  g  2   &#x210F; c  Q  1    Q  2     4
      &#x03C0;      1 r   .   {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {-g^
      {2}\hbar cQ_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi }}{\frac {1}{r}}.}  [{\displaystyle V(\mathbf
      {r} )={\frac {-g^{2}\hbar cQ_{1}Q_{2}}{4\pi }}{\frac {1}{r}}.}]
For various reasons, it is more convenient to define the fine-structure
constant     &#x03B1; =    g  2    4 &#x03C0;      {\displaystyle \alpha =
{\frac {g^{2}}{4\pi }}}  [{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {g^{2}}{4\pi }}}], and
then define     e =   4 &#x03C0; &#x03B1;  &#x03B5;  0   &#x210F; c
{\displaystyle e={\sqrt {4\pi \alpha \varepsilon _{0}\hbar c}}}  [
{\displaystyle e={\sqrt {4\pi \alpha \varepsilon _{0}\hbar c}}}]. Rearranging
these definitions gives:
          g  2   &#x210F; c =    e  2    &#x03B5;  0       {\displaystyle g^
      {2}\hbar c={\frac {e^{2}}{\varepsilon _{0}}}}  [{\displaystyle g^{2}\hbar
      c={\frac {e^{2}}{\varepsilon _{0}}}}]
It is worth noting that     g = e   {\displaystyle g=e}  [{\displaystyle g=e}]
in natural units (since, in those units,     &#x210F; = 1   {\displaystyle
\hbar =1}  [\hbar = 1],     c = 1   {\displaystyle c=1}  [c=1], and
&#x03B5;  0   = 1   {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}=1}  [{\displaystyle
\varepsilon _{0}=1}]). Continuing in SI units, the potential is therefore
         V (  r  ) =    &#x2212;  e  2     4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0          Q
      1    Q  2    r     {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {-e^{2}}{4\pi
      \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r}}}  [{\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r}
      )={\frac {-e^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r}}}]
Defining      q  i   = e  Q  i     {\displaystyle q_{i}=eQ_{i}}  [
{\displaystyle q_{i}=eQ_{i}}], as the macroscopic 'electric charge', makes e
the macroscopic 'electric charge' for an electron, and enables the formula to
be put into the familiar form of the Coulomb potential:
         V (  r  ) =    &#x2212; 1   4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0          q  1    q
      2    r     {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {-1}{4\pi \varepsilon _
      {0}}}{\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{r}}}  [{\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {-
      1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{r}}}]
The force (       d V (  r  )   d r      {\displaystyle {\frac {dV(\mathbf {r}
)}{dr}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {dV(\mathbf {r} )}{dr}}}]) is therefore :
         F (  r  ) =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0          q  1    q  2     r
      2       {\displaystyle F(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}
      {\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {1}
      {4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}}}]
The derivation makes clear that the force law is only an approximation â it
ignores the momentum of the input and output fermion lines, and ignores all
quantum corrections (i.e. the myriad possible diagrams with internal loops).
The Coulomb potential, and its derivation, can be seen as a special case of the
Yukawa_potential (specifically, the case where the exchanged boson â the
photon â has no rest mass).
***** Scalar form[edit] *****
The absolute value of the force F between two point_charges q and Q relates to
the distance between the point charges and to the simple product of their
charges. The diagram shows that like charges repel each other, and opposite
charges mutually attract.
When it is of interest to know the magnitude of the electrostatic force (and
not its direction), it may be easiest to consider a scalar version of the law.
The scalar_form of Coulomb's Law relates the magnitude and sign of the
electrostatic force F acting simultaneously on two point charges q1 and q2 as
follows:
          |   F   |  =  k  e       |   q  1    q  2    |    r  2
      {\displaystyle |{\boldsymbol {F}}|=k_{e}{|q_{1}q_{2}| \over r^{2}}}
      [|\boldsymbol{F}|=k_e{|q_1q_2|\over r^2}]
where r is the separation distance and ke is Coulomb's constant. If the product
q1q2 is positive, the force between the two charges is repulsive; if the
product is negative, the force between them is attractive.[25]
***** Vector form[edit] *****
In the image, the vector F1 is the force experienced by q1, and the vector F2
is the force experienced by q2. When q1q2 > 0 the forces are repulsive (as in
the image) and when q1q2 < 0 the forces are attractive (opposite to the image).
The magnitude of the forces will always be equal.
Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic force F1 experienced by a charge,
q1 at position r1, in the vicinity of another charge, q2 at position r2, in a
vacuum is equal to:
           F  1    =     q  1    q  2     4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0         (   r
      1   &#x2212;  r  2    )    |    r  1   &#x2212;  r  2      |   3      =
      q  1    q  2     4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0             r &#x005E;     21
      |    r  21      |   2      ,   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F_{1}}}={q_
      {1}q_{2} \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}{({\boldsymbol {r_{1}-r_{2}}}) \over
      |{\boldsymbol {r_{1}-r_{2}}}|^{3}}={q_{1}q_{2} \over 4\pi \varepsilon _
      {0}}{{\boldsymbol {{\widehat {r}}_{21}}} \over |{\boldsymbol {r_{21}}}|^
      {2}},}  [{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F_{1}}}={q_{1}q_{2} \over 4\pi
      \varepsilon _{0}}{({\boldsymbol {r_{1}-r_{2}}}) \over |{\boldsymbol {r_
      {1}-r_{2}}}|^{3}}={q_{1}q_{2} \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}{{\boldsymbol {
      {\widehat {r}}_{21}}} \over |{\boldsymbol {r_{21}}}|^{2}},}]
where r21 = r1 â r2, the unit vector rÌ21 = r21/|r21|, and Îµ0 is the
electric_constant.
The vector form of Coulomb's law is simply the scalar definition of the law
with the direction given by the unit_vector, rÌ21, parallel with the line from
charge q2 to charge q1.[26] If both charges have the same sign (like charges)
then the product q1q2 is positive and the direction of the force on q1 is given
by rÌ21; the charges repel each other. If the charges have opposite signs then
the product q1q2 is negative and the direction of the force on q1 is given by
ârÌ21 = rÌ12; the charges attract each other.
The electrostatic force F2 experienced by q2, according to Newton's_third_law,
is F2 = âF1.
**** System of discrete charges[edit] ****
The law_of_superposition allows Coulomb's law to be extended to include any
number of point charges. The force acting on a point charge due to a system of
point charges is simply the vector_addition of the individual forces acting
alone on that point charge due to each one of the charges. The resulting force
vector is parallel to the electric_field vector at that point, with that point
charge removed.
The force F on a small charge q at position r, due to a system of N discrete
charges in vacuum is:
          F ( r )  =   q  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0       &#x2211;  i = 1   N
      q  i      r &#x2212;  r  i      |   r &#x2212;  r  i      |   3      =
      q  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0       &#x2211;  i = 1   N    q  i         R  i
      &#x005E;      |    R  i      |   2      ,   {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol
      {F(r)}}={q \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}q_{i}{{\boldsymbol
      {r-r_{i}}} \over |{\boldsymbol {r-r_{i}}}|^{3}}={q \over 4\pi \varepsilon
      _{0}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}q_{i}{{\boldsymbol {\widehat {R_{i}}}} \over |
      {\boldsymbol {R_{i}}}|^{2}},}  [{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F(r)}}={q
      \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}\sum _{i=1}^{N}q_{i}{{\boldsymbol {r-r_{i}}}
      \over |{\boldsymbol {r-r_{i}}}|^{3}}={q \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}\sum
      _{i=1}^{N}q_{i}{{\boldsymbol {\widehat {R_{i}}}} \over |{\boldsymbol {R_
      {i}}}|^{2}},}]
where qi and ri are the magnitude and position respectively of the ith charge,
RÌi is a unit vector in the direction of Ri = r â ri (a vector pointing from
charges qi to q).[26]
**** Continuous charge distribution[edit] ****
In this case, the principle of linear_superposition is also used. For a
continuous charge distribution, an integral over the region containing the
charge is equivalent to an infinite summation, treating each infinitesimal
element of space as a point charge dq. The distribution of charge is usually
linear, surface or volumetric.
For a linear charge distribution (a good approximation for charge in a wire)
where Î»(râ²) gives the charge per unit length at position râ², and dââ²
is an infinitesimal element of length,
         d q = &#x03BB; (   r &#x2032;   )  d  &#x2113; &#x2032;  .
      {\displaystyle dq=\lambda ({\boldsymbol {r'}})\,d\ell '.}  [
      {\displaystyle dq=\lambda ({\boldsymbol {r'}})\,d\ell '.}][27]
For a surface charge distribution (a good approximation for charge on a plate
in a parallel plate capacitor) where Ï(râ²) gives the charge per unit area at
position râ², and dAâ² is an infinitesimal element of area,
         d q = &#x03C3; (   r &#x2032;   )  d  A &#x2032;  .   {\displaystyle
      dq=\sigma ({\boldsymbol {r'}})\,dA'.}  [dq = \sigma(\boldsymbol
      {r'})\,dA'.]
For a volume charge distribution (such as charge within a bulk metal) where Ï
(râ²) gives the charge per unit volume at position râ², and dVâ² is an
infinitesimal element of volume,
         d q = &#x03C1; (   r &#x2032;   )  d  V &#x2032;  .   {\displaystyle
      dq=\rho ({\boldsymbol {r'}})\,dV'.}  [dq = \rho(\boldsymbol{r'})\,dV'.]
      [26]
The force on a small test charge qâ² at position r in vacuum is given by the
integral over the distribution of charge:
          F  =    q &#x2032;   4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0      &#x222B; d q     r
      &#x2212;   r &#x2032;      |   r  &#x2212;   r &#x2032;     |   3      .
      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F}}={q' \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}\int dq{
      {\boldsymbol {r}}-{\boldsymbol {r'}} \over |{\boldsymbol {r}}-
      {\boldsymbol {r'}}|^{3}}.}  [\boldsymbol{F} = {q'\over
      4\pi\varepsilon_0}\int dq {\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'} \over
      |\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'}|^3}.]
***** Simple experiment to verify Coulomb's law[edit] *****
Experiment to verify Coulomb's law.
It is possible to verify Coulomb's law with a simple experiment. Consider two
small spheres of mass m and same-sign charge q, hanging from two ropes of
negligible mass of length l. The forces acting on each sphere are three: the
weight mg, the rope tension T and the electric force F.
In the equilibrium state:
         T &#xA0; sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1   =  F  1             
      {\displaystyle T\ \sin \theta _{1}=F_{1}\,\!}  [T \ \sin      (1)
      \theta_1 =F_1 \,\!]
and:
         T &#xA0; cos &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1   = m g                     
      {\displaystyle T\ \cos \theta _{1}=mg\,\!}  [T \ \cos \theta_1      (2)
      =mg \,\!]
Dividing (1) by (2):
            sin &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1     cos &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1
      =    F  1    m g    &#x21D2;  F  1   = m g tan &#x2061;
      &#x03B8;  1     {\displaystyle {\frac {\sin \theta _{1}}{\cos    (3)
      \theta _{1}}}={\frac {F_{1}}{mg}}\Rightarrow F_{1}=mg\tan        
      \theta _{1}}  [\frac {\sin \theta_1}{\cos \theta_1 }=
      \frac {F_1}{mg}\Rightarrow F_1= mg \tan \theta_1 ]
Let L1 be the distance between the charged spheres; the repulsion force between
them F1, assuming Coulomb's law is correct, is equal to

          F  1   =    q  2    4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0
      L  1   2        {\displaystyle F_{1}={\frac {q^{2}}    
      {4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{1}^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle      (Coulomb's law)
      F_{1}={\frac {q^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{1}^
      {2}}}}]
so:
            q  2    4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0    L  1   2      = m g
      tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1       {\displaystyle {\frac {q^{2}}    
      {4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{1}^{2}}}=mg\tan \theta _{1}\,\!}  [       (4)
      {\displaystyle {\frac {q^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{1}^
      {2}}}=mg\tan \theta _{1}\,\!}]
If we now discharge one of the spheres, and we put it in contact with the
charged sphere, each one of them acquires a charge q/2. In the equilibrium
state, the distance between the charges will be L2 < L1 and the repulsion force
between them will be:
          F  2   =     (   q 2   )   2    4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0
      L  2   2      =     q  2   4   4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0    L  2
      2          {\displaystyle F_{2}={\frac {{({\frac {q}{2}})}^{2}}
      {4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{2}^{2}}}={\frac {\frac {q^{2}}{4}}        (5)
      {4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{2}^{2}}}\,\!}  [{\displaystyle F_{2}=     
      {\frac {{({\frac {q}{2}})}^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{2}^
      {2}}}={\frac {\frac {q^{2}}{4}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{2}^
      {2}}}\,\!}]
We know that F2 = mg tan Î¸2. And:
             q  2   4   4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0    L  2   2      = m g tan
      &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  2     {\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {q^{2}}{4}}{4\pi
      \varepsilon _{0}L_{2}^{2}}}=mg\tan \theta _{2}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac
      {\frac {q^{2}}{4}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{2}^{2}}}=mg\tan \theta _{2}}]
Dividing (4) by (5), we get:
            (          q  2            4 &#x03C0;  &#x03B5;  0    L
      1   2        )   (           q  2   4           4 &#x03C0;
      &#x03B5;  0    L  2   2        )    =    m g tan &#x2061;
      &#x03B8;  1     m g tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  2      &#x21D2; 4
      (    L  2    L  1     )    2   =    tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1
      tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  2        {\displaystyle {\frac {\left(
      {\cfrac {q^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{1}^{2}}}\right)}{\left(
      {\cfrac {\frac {q^{2}}{4}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{2}^             
      {2}}}\right)}}={\frac {mg\tan \theta _{1}}{mg\tan \theta _           (6)
      {2}}}\Rightarrow 4{\left({\frac {L_{2}}{L_{1}}}\right)}^{2}=
      {\frac {\tan \theta _{1}}{\tan \theta _{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle
      {\frac {\left({\cfrac {q^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}L_{1}^
      {2}}}\right)}{\left({\cfrac {\frac {q^{2}}{4}}{4\pi \varepsilon
      _{0}L_{2}^{2}}}\right)}}={\frac {mg\tan \theta _{1}}{mg\tan
      \theta _{2}}}\Rightarrow 4{\left({\frac {L_{2}}{L_
      {1}}}\right)}^{2}={\frac {\tan \theta _{1}}{\tan \theta _
      {2}}}}]
Measuring the angles Î¸1 and Î¸2 and the distance between the charges L1 and L2
is sufficient to verify that the equality is true taking into account the
experimental error. In practice, angles can be difficult to measure, so if the
length of the ropes is sufficiently great, the angles will be small enough to
make the following approximation:
         tan &#x2061; &#x03B8; &#x2248; sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; =    L
      2  &#x2113;   =   L  2 &#x2113;    &#x21D2;    tan &#x2061;
      &#x03B8;  1     tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  2      &#x2248;     L
      1    2 &#x2113;     L  2    2 &#x2113;       {\displaystyle
      \tan \theta \approx \sin \theta ={\frac {\frac {L}{2}}{\ell }}=
      {\frac {L}{2\ell }}\Rightarrow {\frac {\tan \theta _{1}}{\tan      (7)
      \theta _{2}}}\approx {\frac {\frac {L_{1}}{2\ell }}{\frac {L_      
      {2}}{2\ell }}}}  [{\displaystyle \tan \theta \approx \sin
      \theta ={\frac {\frac {L}{2}}{\ell }}={\frac {L}{2\ell
      }}\Rightarrow {\frac {\tan \theta _{1}}{\tan \theta _
      {2}}}\approx {\frac {\frac {L_{1}}{2\ell }}{\frac {L_{2}}{2\ell
      }}}}]
Using this approximation, the relationship (6) becomes the much simpler
expression:
             L  1    2 &#x2113;     L  2    2 &#x2113;     &#x2248; 4
      (    L  2    L  1     )    2   &#x21D2;     {\displaystyle
      {\frac {\frac {L_{1}}{2\ell }}{\frac {L_{2}}{2\ell }}}\approx 4
      {\left({\frac {L_{2}}{L_{1}}}\right)}^{2}\Rightarrow \,\!}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\frac {L_{1}}{2\ell }}{\frac {L_{2}}
      {2\ell }}}\approx 4{\left({\frac {L_{2}}{L_{1}}}\right)}^
      {2}\Rightarrow \,\!}]        L  1    L  2     &#x2248; 4           (8)
      (    L  2    L  1     )    2   &#x21D2;    L  1    L  2            
      &#x2248;   4  3        {\displaystyle {\frac {L_{1}}{L_
      {2}}}\approx 4{\left({\frac {L_{2}}{L_{1}}}\right)}^
      {2}\Rightarrow {\frac {L_{1}}{L_{2}}}\approx {\sqrt[{3}]
      {4}}\,\!}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {L_{1}}{L_{2}}}\approx 4
      {\left({\frac {L_{2}}{L_{1}}}\right)}^{2}\Rightarrow {\frac {L_
      {1}}{L_{2}}}\approx {\sqrt[{3}]{4}}\,\!}]
In this way, the verification is limited to measuring the distance between the
charges and check that the division approximates the theoretical value.
***** Atomic forces[edit] *****
See also: Coulomb_explosion
Coulomb's law holds even within atoms, correctly describing the force between
the positively charged atomic_nucleus and each of the negatively charged
electrons. This simple law also correctly accounts for the forces that bind
atoms together to form molecules and for the forces that bind atoms and
molecules together to form solids and liquids. Generally, as the distance
between ions increases, the force of attraction, and binding energy, approach
zero and ionic_bonding is less favorable. As the magnitude of opposing charges
increases, energy increases and ionic bonding is more favorable.

           May we not infer from this experiment, that the attraction of
           electricity is subject to the same laws with that of
           gravitation, and is therefore according to the squares of the
           distances; since it is easily demonstrated, that were the earth
           in the form of a shell, a body in the inside of it would not be
           attracted to one side more than another?

      On page_68, the author states that in 1769 he announced his findings
      regarding the force between spheres of like charge. On page_73, the
      author states the force between spheres of like charge varies as
      xâ2.06:
           The result of the whole was, that the mutual repulsion of two
           spheres, electrified positively or negatively, was very nearly
           in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distances of
           their centres, or rather in a proportion somewhat greater,
           approaching to xâ2.06.
  24. When making experiments with charged spheres of opposite charge the
      results were similar, as stated on page_73:
           When the experiments were repeated with balls having opposite
           electricities, and which therefore attracted each other, the
           results were not altogether so regular and a few irregularities
           amounted to &#x200b;1⁄6 of the whole; but these anomalies were
           as often on one side of the medium as on the other. This series
           of experiments gave a result which deviated as little as the
           former (or rather less) from the inverse duplicate ratio of the
           distances; but the deviation was in defect as the other was in
           excess.
  25. Nonetheless, on page_74 the author infers that the actual action is
      related exactly to the inverse duplicate of the distance:
           We therefore think that it may be concluded, that the action
           between two spheres is exactly in the inverse duplicate ratio
           of the distance of their centres, and that this difference
           between the observed attractions and repulsions is owing to
           some unperceived cause in the form of the experiment.
  26. On page_75, the authour compares the electric and gravitational forces:
           Therefore we may conclude, that the law of electric attraction
           and repulsion is similar to that of gravitation, and that each
           of those forces diminishes in the same proportion that the
           square of the distance between the particles increases.

  28.
      On pages_111_and_112 the author states:
           We may therefore conclude that the electric attraction and
           repulsion must be inversely as some power of the distance
           between that of the 2 + &#x200b;1⁄50 th and that of the 2 â
           &#x200b;1⁄50 th, and there is no reason to think that it
           differs at all from the inverse duplicate ratio.

      magnÃ©tisme," Histoire de lâAcadÃ©mie Royale des Sciences, pp.
      569â577 â Coulomb studied the repulsive force between bodies having
      electrical charges of the same sign:
           Il rÃ©sulte donc de ces trois essais, que l'action rÃ©pulsive
           que les deux balles Ã©lectrifÃ©es de la mÃªme nature
           d'Ã©lectricitÃ© exercent l'une sur l'autre, suit la raison
           inverse du carrÃ© des distances.
           Translation: It follows therefore from these three tests, that
           the repulsive force that the two balls â [that were]
           electrified with the same kind of electricity â exert on each
           other, follows the inverse proportion of the square of the
           distance.
  30. Coulomb also showed that oppositely charged bodies obey an inverse-square
      law of attraction.
