An electromagnetic field (also EMF or EM field) is a physical field produced by
moving electrically_charged_objects.[1] It affects the behavior of non-comoving
charged objects at any distance of the field. The electromagnetic field extends
indefinitely throughout space and describes the electromagnetic_interaction. It
is one of the four fundamental_forces of nature (the others are gravitation,
weak_interaction and strong_interaction).
The field can be viewed as the combination of an electric_field and a magnetic
field. The electric field is produced by stationary charges, and the magnetic
field by moving charges (currents); these two are often described as the
sources of the field. The way in which charges and currents interact with the
electromagnetic field is described by Maxwell's_equations and the Lorentz_force
law.[2] The force created by the electric field is much stronger than the force
created by the magnetic field.[3]
From a classical perspective in the history_of_electromagnetism, the
electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth, continuous field, propagated
in a wavelike manner; whereas from the perspective of quantum_field_theory, the
field is seen as quantized, being composed of individual particles.

***** Structure[edit] *****
The electromagnetic field may be viewed in two distinct ways: a continuous
structure or a discrete structure.
**** Continuous structure[edit] ****
Classically, electric and magnetic fields are thought of as being produced by
smooth motions of charged objects. For example, oscillating charges produce
variations in electric and magnetic fields that may be viewed in a 'smooth',
continuous, wavelike fashion. In this case, energy is viewed as being
transferred continuously through the electromagnetic field between any two
locations. For instance, the metal atoms in a radio transmitter appear to
transfer energy continuously. This view is useful to a certain extent
(radiation of low frequency), but problems are found at high frequencies (see
ultraviolet_catastrophe).[4]
**** Discrete structure[edit] ****
The electromagnetic field may be thought of in a more 'coarse' way. Experiments
reveal that in some circumstances electromagnetic energy transfer is better
described as being carried in the form of packets called quanta (in this case,
photons) with a fixed frequency. Planck's relation links the photon_energy E of
a photon to its frequency f through the equation:[5]
         E =  h f   {\displaystyle E=\,hf}  [{\displaystyle E=\,hf}]
where h is Planck's_constant, and f is the frequency of the photon . Although
modern quantum optics tells us that there also is a semi-classical explanation
of the photoelectric_effectâthe emission of electrons from metallic surfaces
subjected to electromagnetic_radiationâthe photon was historically (although
not strictly necessarily) used to explain certain observations. It is found
that increasing the intensity of the incident radiation (so long as one remains
in the linear regime) increases only the number of electrons ejected, and has
almost no effect on the energy distribution of their ejection. Only the
frequency of the radiation is relevant to the energy of the ejected electrons.
This quantum picture of the electromagnetic field (which treats it as analogous
to harmonic_oscillators) has proven very successful, giving rise to quantum
electrodynamics, a quantum_field_theory describing the interaction of
electromagnetic radiation with charged matter. It also gives rise to quantum
optics, which is different from quantum electrodynamics in that the matter
itself is modelled using quantum_mechanics rather than quantum field theory.
***** Dynamics[edit] *****
In the past, electrically_charged objects were thought to produce two
different, unrelated types of field associated with their charge property. An
electric_field is produced when the charge is stationary with respect to an
observer measuring the properties of the charge, and a magnetic_field as well
as an electric field is produced when the charge moves, creating an electric
current with respect to this observer. Over time, it was realized that the
electric and magnetic fields are better thought of as two parts of a greater
whole â the electromagnetic field. Until 1820, when the Danish physicist H.
C._Ãrsted showed the effect of electric current on a compass needle,
electricity and magnetism had been viewed as unrelated phenomena[6]. In 1831,
Michael_Faraday made the seminal observation that time-varying magnetic fields
could induce electric currents and then, in 1864, James_Clerk_Maxwell published
his famous paper A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.[7]
Once this electromagnetic field has been produced from a given charge
distribution, other charged or magnetised objects in this field may experience
a force. If these other charges and currents are comparable in size to the
sources producing the above electromagnetic field, then a new net
electromagnetic field will be produced. Thus, the electromagnetic field may be
viewed as a dynamic entity that causes other charges and currents to move, and
which is also affected by them. These interactions are described by Maxwell's
equations and the Lorentz_force_law. This discussion ignores the radiation
reaction_force.
***** Feedback loop[edit] *****
The behavior of the electromagnetic field can be divided into four different
parts of a loop:[8]
    * the electric and magnetic fields are generated by moving electric
      charges,
    * the electric and magnetic fields interact with each other,
    * the electric and magnetic fields produce forces on electric charges,
    * the electric charges move in space.
A common misunderstanding is that (a) the quanta of the fields act in the same
manner as (b) the charged particles, such as electrons, that generate the
fields. In our everyday world, electrons travel slowly through conductors with
a drift_velocity of a fraction of a centimeter (or inch) per second and through
a vacuum_tube at speeds of around 1 thousand km/s,[9] but fields propagate at
the speed_of_light, approximately 300 thousand kilometers (or 186 thousand
miles) a second. The speed ratio between charged particles in a conductor and
field quanta is on the order of one to a million. Maxwell's_equations relate
(a) the presence and movement of charged particles with (b) the generation of
fields. Those fields can then affect the force on, and can then move other
slowly moving charged particles. Charged particles can move at relativistic
speeds nearing field propagation speeds, but, as Einstein showed[citation
needed], this requires enormous field energies, which are not present in our
everyday experiences with electricity, magnetism, matter, and time and space.
The feedback loop can be summarized in a list, including phenomena belonging to
each part of the loop:[citation_needed]
    * charged particles generate electric and magnetic fields
    * the fields interact with each other
          o changing electric field acts like a current, generating 'vortex' of
            magnetic field
          o Faraday_induction: changing magnetic field induces (negative)
            vortex of electric field
          o Lenz's_law: negative feedback loop between electric and magnetic
            fields
    * fields act upon particles
          o Lorentz force: force due to electromagnetic field
                # electric force: same direction as electric field
                # magnetic force: perpendicular both to magnetic field and to
                  velocity of charge
    * particles move
          o current is movement of particles
    * particles generate more electric and magnetic fields; cycle repeats
***** Mathematical description[edit] *****
Main article: Mathematical_descriptions_of_the_electromagnetic_field
There are different mathematical ways of representing the electromagnetic
field. The first one views the electric and magnetic fields as three-
dimensional vector_fields. These vector fields each have a value defined at
every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the
space and time coordinates. As such, they are often written as E(x, y, z, t)
(electric_field) and B(x, y, z, t) (magnetic_field).
If only the electric field (E) is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field
is said to be an electrostatic_field. Similarly, if only the magnetic field (B)
is non-zero and is constant in time, the field is said to be a magnetostatic
field. However, if either the electric or magnetic field has a time-dependence,
then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field
using Maxwell's_equations.[10]
With the advent of special_relativity, physical laws became susceptible to the
formalism of tensors. Maxwell's equations can be written in tensor form,
generally viewed by physicists as a more elegant means of expressing physical
laws.
The behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, whether in cases of
electrostatics, magnetostatics, or electrodynamics (electromagnetic fields), is
governed by Maxwell's equations. In the vector field formalism, these are:
         &#x2207; &#x22C5;  E  =   &#x03C1;  &#x03B5;  0       {\displaystyle
      \nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} ={\frac {\rho }{\varepsilon _{0}}}}  [\nabla
      \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}] (Gauss's_law)
         &#x2207; &#x22C5;  B  = 0   {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {B}
      =0}  [\nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} =0] (Gauss's_law_for_magnetism)
         &#x2207; &#x00D7;  E  = &#x2212;    &#x2202;  B    &#x2202; t
      {\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {E} =-{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }
      {\partial t}}}  [\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac {\partial \mathbf{B}}
      {\partial t}] (Faraday's_law)
         &#x2207; &#x00D7;  B  =  &#x03BC;  0    J  +  &#x03BC;  0    &#x03B5;
      0      &#x2202;  E    &#x2202; t      {\displaystyle \nabla \times
      \mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}\mathbf {J} +\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac
      {\partial \mathbf {E} }{\partial t}}}  [{\displaystyle \nabla \times
      \mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}\mathbf {J} +\mu _{0}\varepsilon _{0}{\frac
      {\partial \mathbf {E} }{\partial t}}}] (MaxwellâAmpÃ¨re_law)
where     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is the charge density,
which can (and often does) depend on time and position,      &#x03F5;  0
{\displaystyle \epsilon _{0}}  [\epsilon _{0}] is the permittivity of free
space,      &#x03BC;  0     {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}  [\mu _{0}] is the
permeability of free space, and J is the current density vector, also a
function of time and position. The units used above are the standard SI units.
Inside a linear material, Maxwell's equations change by switching the
permeability and permittivity of free space with the permeability and
permittivity of the linear material in question. Inside other materials which
possess more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these terms are often
represented by complex numbers, or tensors.
The Lorentz_force_law governs the interaction of the electromagnetic field with
charged matter.
When a field travels across to different media, the properties of the field
change according to the various boundary conditions. These equations are
derived from Maxwell's equations. The tangential components of the electric and
magnetic fields as they relate on the boundary of two media are as follows:[11]
           E   1   =   E   2     {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} _{1}=\mathbf {E} _
      {2}}  [\mathbf{E}_{1} = \mathbf{E}_{2} ]
           H   1   =   H   2     {\displaystyle \mathbf {H} _{1}=\mathbf {H} _
      {2}}  [\mathbf{H}_{1} = \mathbf{H}_{2} ] (current-free)
           D   1   =   D   2     {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} _{1}=\mathbf {D} _
      {2}}  [\mathbf{D}_{1} = \mathbf{D}_{2} ] (charge-free)
           B   1   =   B   2     {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} _{1}=\mathbf {B} _
      {2}}  [\mathbf{B}_{1} = \mathbf{B}_{2} ]
The angle of refraction of an electric field between media is related to the
permittivity     ( &#x03B5; )   {\displaystyle (\varepsilon )}  [(\varepsilon)]
of each medium:
            tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1     tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  2      =
      &#x03B5;  r 2    &#x03B5;  r 1       {\displaystyle {\frac {\tan \theta _
      {1}}{\tan \theta _{2}}}={\frac {\varepsilon _{r2}}{\varepsilon _{r1}}}}
      [\frac{{\tan\theta_1}}{{\tan\theta_2}} = \frac{{\varepsilon_{r2}}}{
      {\varepsilon_{r1}}}]
The angle of refraction of a magnetic field between media is related to the
permeability     ( &#x03BC; )   {\displaystyle (\mu )}  [(\mu)] of each medium:
            tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  1     tan &#x2061;  &#x03B8;  2      =
      &#x03BC;  r 2    &#x03BC;  r 1       {\displaystyle {\frac {\tan \theta _
      {1}}{\tan \theta _{2}}}={\frac {\mu _{r2}}{\mu _{r1}}}}  [\frac{
      {\tan\theta_1}}{{\tan\theta_2}} = \frac{{\mu_{r2}}}{{\mu_{r1}}}]
***** Properties of the field[edit] *****
**** Reciprocal behavior of electric and magnetic fields[edit] ****
The two Maxwell equations, Faraday's Law and the AmpÃ¨re-Maxwell Law,
illustrate a very practical feature of the electromagnetic field. Faraday's Law
may be stated roughly as 'a changing magnetic field creates an electric field'.
This is the principle behind the electric_generator.
Ampere's Law roughly states that 'a changing electric field creates a magnetic
field'. Thus, this law can be applied to generate a magnetic field and run an
electric_motor.
**** Behavior of the fields in the absence of charges or currents[edit] ****
Maxwell's_equations take the form of an electromagnetic_wave in a volume of
space not containing charges or currents (free_space) â that is, where
&#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] and J are zero. Under these
conditions, the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the electromagnetic_wave
equation:[12]
          (   &#x2207;  2   &#x2212;   1   c   2        &#x2202;  2    &#x2202;
      t  2       )   E  &#xA0; &#xA0; = &#xA0; &#xA0; 0   {\displaystyle \left
      (\nabla ^{2}-{1 \over {c}^{2}}{\partial ^{2} \over \partial t^
      {2}}\right)\mathbf {E} \ \ =\ \ 0}  [{\displaystyle \left(\nabla ^{2}-{1
      \over {c}^{2}}{\partial ^{2} \over \partial t^{2}}\right)\mathbf {E} \ \
      =\ \ 0}]
          (   &#x2207;  2   &#x2212;   1   c   2        &#x2202;  2    &#x2202;
      t  2       )   B  &#xA0; &#xA0; = &#xA0; &#xA0; 0   {\displaystyle \left
      (\nabla ^{2}-{1 \over {c}^{2}}{\partial ^{2} \over \partial t^
      {2}}\right)\mathbf {B} \ \ =\ \ 0}  [{\displaystyle \left(\nabla ^{2}-{1
      \over {c}^{2}}{\partial ^{2} \over \partial t^{2}}\right)\mathbf {B} \ \
      =\ \ 0}]
James_Clerk_Maxwell was the first to obtain this relationship by his completion
of Maxwell's_equations with the addition of a displacement_current term to
Ampere's_circuital_law.
***** Relation to and comparison with other physical fields[edit] *****
Main article: Fundamental_forces
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (June
         2008)
Being one of the four fundamental forces of nature, it is useful to compare the
electromagnetic field with the gravitational, strong and weak fields. The word
'force' is sometimes replaced by 'interaction' because modern particle_physics
models electromagnetism as an exchange of particles known as gauge_bosons.
**** Electromagnetic and gravitational fields[edit] ****
Sources of electromagnetic fields consist of two types of charge â positive
and negative. This contrasts with the sources of the gravitational field, which
are masses. Masses are sometimes described as gravitational charges, the
important feature of them being that there are only positive masses and no
negative_masses. Further, gravity differs from electromagnetism in that
positive masses attract other positive masses whereas same charges in
electromagnetism repel each other.
The relative strengths and ranges of the four interactions and other
information are tabulated below:

***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Static E and M fields and static EM fields[edit] ****
Main articles: electrostatics, magnetostatics, and magnetism
When an EM field (see electromagnetic_tensor) is not varying in time, it may be
seen as a purely electrical field or a purely magnetic field, or a mixture of
both. However the general case of a static EM field with both electric and
magnetic components present, is the case that appears to most observers.
Observers who see only an electric or magnetic field component of a static EM
field, have the other (electric or magnetic) component suppressed, due to the
special case of the immobile state of the charges that produce the EM field in
that case. In such cases the other component becomes manifest in other observer
frames.
A consequence of this, is that any case that seems to consist of a "pure"
static electric or magnetic field, can be converted to an EM field, with both E
and M components present, by simply moving the observer into a frame_of
reference which is moving with regard to the frame in which only the âpureâ
electric or magnetic field appears. That is, a pure static electric field will
show the familiar magnetic field associated with a current, in any frame_of
reference where the charge moves. Likewise, any new motion of a charge in a
region that seemed previously to contain only a magnetic field, will show that
the space now contains an electric field as well, which will be found to
produces an additional Lorentz force upon the moving charge.
Thus, electrostatics, as well as magnetism and magnetostatics, are now seen as
studies of the static EM field when a particular frame has been selected to
suppress the other type of field, and since an EM field with both electric and
magnetic will appear in any other frame, these "simpler" effects are merely the
observer's. The "applications" of all such non-time varying (static) fields are
discussed in the main articles linked in this section.
**** Time-varying EM fields in Maxwellâs equations[edit] ****
Main articles: near_and_far_field, near_field_optics, virtual_particle,
dielectric_heating, and Electromagnetic_induction
An EM field that varies in time has two âcausesâ in Maxwellâs equations.
One is charges and currents (so-called âsourcesâ), and the other cause for
an E or M field is a change in the other type of field (this last cause also
appears in âfree spaceâ very far from currents and charges).
An electromagnetic field very far from currents and charges (sources) is called
electromagnetic_radiation (EMR) since it radiates from the charges and currents
in the source, and has no "feedback" effect on them, and is also not affected
directly by them in the present time (rather, it is indirectly produced by a
sequences of changes in fields radiating out from them in the past). EMR
consists of the radiations in the electromagnetic_spectrum, including radio
waves, microwave, infrared, visible_light, ultraviolet_light, X-rays, and gamma
rays. The many commercial applications of these radiations are discussed in the
named and linked articles.
A notable application of visible light is that this type of energy from the Sun
powers all life on Earth that either makes or uses oxygen.
A changing electromagnetic field which is physically close to currents and
charges (see near_and_far_field for a definition of âcloseâ) will have a
dipole characteristic that is dominated by either a changing electric_dipole,
or a changing magnetic_dipole. This type of dipole field near sources is called
an electromagnetic near-field.
Changing electric dipole fields, as such, are used commercially as near-fields
mainly as a source of dielectric_heating. Otherwise, they appear parasitically
around conductors which absorb EMR, and around antennas which have the purpose
of generating EMR at greater distances.
Changing magnetic dipole fields (i.e., magnetic near-fields) are used
commercially for many types of magnetic_induction devices. These include motors
and electrical transformers at low frequencies, and devices such as metal
detectors and MRI scanner coils at higher frequencies. Sometimes these high-
frequency magnetic fields change at radio frequencies without being far-field
waves and thus radio waves; see RFID tags. See also near-field_communication.
Further uses of near-field EM effects commercially, may be found in the article
on virtual_photons, since at the quantum level, these fields are represented by
these particles. Far-field effects (EMR) in the quantum picture of radiation,
are represented by ordinary photons.

    * Old televisions can be traced with Electromagnetic fields.
***** Health and safety[edit] *****
The potential effects of electromagnetic fields on human health vary widely
depending on the frequency and intensity of the fields.
The potential health effects of the very low frequency EMFs surrounding power
lines and electrical devices are the subject of on-going research and a
significant amount of public debate. The US National_Institute_for_Occupational
Safety_and_Health (NIOSH) and other US government agencies do not consider EMFs
a proven health hazard. NIOSH has issued some cautionary advisories but
stresses that the data are currently too limited to draw good conclusions.[13]
On the other hand, radiation from other parts of the electromagnetic_spectrum,
such as ultraviolet light and gamma_rays, are known to cause significant harm
in some circumstances. For more information on the health effects due to
specific electromagnetic phenomena and parts of the electromagnetic_spectrum,
