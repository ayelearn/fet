A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to
protect an electrical_circuit from damage caused by excess current from an
overload or short_circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow
after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be
replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to
resume normal operation.
Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect
low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear
designed to protect high_voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic
function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse, as an automatic means of removing
power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as OCPD (Over Current
Protection Device).

***** Origins[edit] *****
An early form of circuit breaker was described by Thomas_Edison in an 1879
patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used
fuses.[1] Its purpose was to protect lighting circuit wiring from accidental
short circuits and overloads. A modern miniature circuit breaker similar to the
ones now in use was patented by Brown,_Boveri_&_Cie in 1924. Hugo Stotz, an
engineer who had sold his company to BBC, was credited as the inventor on DRP
(Deutsches Reichspatent) 458392.[2] Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the
modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this
day.
Interconnection of multiple generator sources into an electrical grid required
the development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and
increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short-circuit currents
produced by networks. Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs
when interrupting high voltages; these gave way to oil-enclosed contacts, and
various forms using the directed flow of pressurized air, or of pressurized
oil, to cool and interrupt the arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit
breakers used at the Boulder_Dam project use eight series breaks and
pressurized oil flow to interrupt faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three cycles of
the AC power frequency.[3]
***** Operation[edit] *****
All circuit breaker systems have common features in their operation, but
details vary substantially depending on the voltage class, current rating and
type of the circuit breaker.
The circuit breaker must first detect a fault condition. In small mains and low
voltage circuit breakers, this is usually done within the device itself.
Typically, the heating or magnetic effects of electric current are employed.
Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with
protective_relay pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the
opening mechanism. These typically require a separate power source, such as a
battery, although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with
current_transformers, protective_relays, and an internal control power source.
Once a fault is detected, the circuit breaker contacts must open to interrupt
the circuit; this is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained
within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the
contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault
to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small
circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to switch off the load
or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use solenoids to trip the
mechanism, and electric_motors to restore energy to the springs.
The circuit breaker contacts must carry the load current without excessive
heating, and must also withstand the heat of the arc produced when interrupting
(opening) the circuit. Contacts are made of copper or copper alloys, silver
alloys and other highly conductive materials. Service life of the contacts is
limited by the erosion of contact material due to arcing while interrupting the
current. Miniature and molded-case circuit breakers are usually discarded when
the contacts have worn, but power circuit breakers and high-voltage circuit
breakers have replaceable contacts.
When a high current or voltage is interrupted, an arc is generated. The length
of the arc is generally proportional to the voltage while the intensity (or
heat) is proportional to the current. This arc must be contained, cooled and
extinguished in a controlled way, so that the gap between the contacts can
again withstand the voltage in the circuit. Different circuit breakers use
vacuum, air, insulating_gas, or oil as the medium the arc forms in. Different
techniques are used to extinguish the arc including:
    * Lengthening or deflecting the arc
    * Intensive cooling (in jet chambers)
    * Division into partial arcs
    * Zero point quenching (contacts open at the zero current time crossing of
      the AC waveform, effectively breaking no load current at the time of
      opening. The zero crossing occurs at twice the line frequency; i.e., 100
      times per second for 50 Hz and 120 times per second for 60 Hz AC.)
    * Connecting capacitors in parallel with contacts in DC circuits.
Finally, once the fault condition has been cleared, the contacts must again be
closed to restore power to the interrupted circuit.
***** Arc interruption[edit] *****
Low-voltage miniature circuit breakers (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the
arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually
insulated parallel metal plates that divide and cool the arc. By splitting the
arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased
and serves as an additional impedance that limits the current through the
circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy
deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current
path, although magnetic_blowout coils or permanent_magnets could also deflect
the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings). The
number of plates in the arc chute is dependent on the short-circuit rating and
nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.
In larger ratings, oil circuit breakers rely upon vaporization of some of the
oil to blast a jet of oil through the arc.[4]
Gas (usually sulfur_hexafluoride) circuit breakers sometimes stretch the arc
using a magnetic field, and then rely upon the dielectric_strength of the
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) to quench the stretched arc.
Vacuum circuit breakers have minimal arcing (as there is nothing to ionize
other than the contact material). The arc quenches when it is stretched a very
small amount (less than 2â3 mm (0.08â0.1 in)). Vacuum circuit breakers are
frequently used in modern medium-voltage switchgear to 38,000 volts.
Air circuit breakers may use compressed_air to blow out the arc, or
alternatively, the contacts are rapidly swung into a small sealed chamber, the
escaping of the displaced air thus blowing out the arc.
Circuit breakers are usually able to terminate all current very quickly:
typically the arc is extinguished between 30 ms and 150 ms after the mechanism
has been tripped, depending upon age and construction of the device. The
maximum current value and let-through energy determine the quality of the
circuit breakers.
***** Short-circuit[edit] *****
Circuit breakers are rated both by the normal current that they are expected to
carry, and the maximum short-circuit current that they can safely interrupt.
This latter figure is the ampere interrupting capacity (AIC) of the breaker.
Under short-circuit conditions, the calculated or measured maximum prospective
short-circuit_current may be many times the normal, rated current of the
circuit. When electrical contacts open to interrupt a large current, there is a
tendency for an arc to form between the opened contacts, which would allow the
current to continue. This condition can create conductive ionized gases and
molten or vaporized metal, which can cause further continuation of the arc, or
creation of additional short circuits, potentially resulting in the explosion
of the circuit breaker and the equipment that it is installed in. Therefore,
circuit breakers must incorporate various features to divide and extinguish the
arc.
The maximum short-circuit current that a breaker can interrupt is determined by
testing. Application of a breaker in a circuit with a prospective short-circuit
current higher than the breaker's interrupting capacity rating may result in
failure of the breaker to safely interrupt a fault. In a worst-case scenario
the breaker may successfully interrupt the fault, only to explode when reset.
Typical domestic panel circuit breakers are rated to interrupt 10 kA (10000 A)
short-circuit current.
Miniature circuit breakers used to protect control circuits or small appliances
may not have sufficient interrupting capacity to use at a panel board; these
circuit breakers are called "supplemental circuit protectors" to distinguish
them from distribution-type circuit breakers.
***** Standard current ratings[edit] *****
Time till trip versus current as multiple of nominal current
Circuit breakers are manufactured in standard sizes, using a system of
preferred_numbers to cover a range of ratings. Miniature circuit breakers have
a fixed trip setting; changing the operating current value requires changing
the whole circuit breaker. Larger circuit breakers can have adjustable trip
settings, allowing standardized elements to be applied but with a setting
intended to improve protection. For example, a circuit breaker with a 400
ampere "frame size" might have its overcurrent detection set to operate at only
300 amperes, to protect a feeder cable.
International_Standards, IEC 60898-1 and European_Standard EN 60898-1, define
the rated current In of a circuit breaker for low voltage distribution
applications as the maximum current that the breaker is designed to carry
continuously (at an ambient air temperature of 30 Â°C). The commonly available
preferred values for the rated current are 1 A, 2 A, 4 A, 6 A, 10 A, 13 A,
16 A, 20 A, 25 A, 32 A, 40 A, 50 A, 63 A, 80 A, 100 A,[5] and 125 A (similar to
the R10 Renard_series, but using 6, 13, and 32 instead of 6.3, 12.5, and 31.5
â it includes the 13 A current limit of British BS_1363 sockets). The circuit
breaker is labeled with the rated current in amperes, but excluding the unit
symbol, A. Instead, the ampere figure is preceded by a letter, B, C, or D,
which indicates the instantaneous tripping current — that is, the minimum value
of current that causes the circuit breaker to trip without intentional time
delay (i.e., in less than 100 ms), expressed in terms of In:
Type Instantaneous tripping current
B    Above 3 In
C    Above 5 In up to and including 10 In
D    Above 10 In up to and including 20 In
     Above 8 In up to and including 12 In
K    For the protection of loads that cause frequent short duration
     (approximately 400 ms to 2 s) current peaks in normal operation.
     Above 2 In up to and including 3 In for periods in the order of tens of
Z    seconds.
     For the protection of loads such as semiconductor devices or measuring
     circuits using current transformers.
Circuit breakers are also rated by the maximum fault current that they can
interrupt; this allows use of more economical devices on systems unlikely to
develop the high short-circuit current found on, for example, a large
commercial building distribution system.
In the United States, Underwriters_Laboratories (UL) certifies equipment
ratings, called Series Ratings (or "integrated equipment ratings") for circuit
breaker equipment used for buildings. Power circuit breakers and medium- and
high-voltage circuit breakers used for industrial or electric power systems are
designed and tested to ANSI or IEEE standards in the C37 series.
***** Types[edit] *****
Front panel of a 1250 A air circuit breaker manufactured by ABB. This low-
voltage power circuit breaker can be withdrawn from its housing for servicing.
Trip characteristics are configurable via DIP_switches on the front panel.
Many classifications of circuit breakers can be made, based on their features
such as voltage class, construction type, interrupting type, and structural
features.
**** Low-voltage[edit] ****
Low-voltage (less than 1,000 VAC) types are common in domestic, commercial and
industrial application, and include:
    * Miniature circuit breaker (MCB)—rated current not more than 100 A. Trip
      characteristics normally not adjustable. Thermal or thermal-magnetic
      operation. Breakers illustrated above are in this category.
    * Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB)—rated current up to 2,500 A. Thermal
      or thermal-magnetic operation. Trip current may be adjustable in larger
      ratings.
    * Low-voltage power circuit breakers can be mounted in multi-tiers in low-
      voltage switchboards or switchgear cabinets.
The characteristics of low-voltage circuit breakers are given by international
standards such as IEC 947. These circuit breakers are often installed in draw-
out enclosures that allow removal and interchange without dismantling the
switchgear.
Large low-voltage molded case and power circuit breakers may have electric
motor operators so they can open and close under remote control. These may form
part of an automatic_transfer_switch system for standby power.
Low-voltage circuit breakers are also made for direct-current (DC)
applications, such as DC for subway lines. Direct current requires special
breakers because the arc is continuousâunlike an AC arc, which tends to go
out on each half cycle. A direct current circuit breaker has blow-out coils
that generate a magnetic field that rapidly stretches the arc. Small circuit
breakers are either installed directly in equipment, or are arranged in a
breaker_panel.
Inside of a circuit breaker
The DIN_rail-mounted thermal-magnetic miniature circuit breaker is the most
common style in modern domestic consumer_units and commercial electrical
distribution_boards throughout Europe. The design includes the following
components:
   1. Actuator lever - used to manually trip and reset the circuit breaker.
      Also indicates the status of the circuit breaker (On or Off/tripped).
      Most breakers are designed so they can still trip even if the lever is
      held or locked in the "on" position. This is sometimes referred to as
      "free trip" or "positive trip" operation.
   2. Actuator mechanism - forces the contacts together or apart.
   3. Contacts - allow current when touching and break the current when moved
      apart.
   4. Terminals
   5. Bimetallic strip - separates contacts in response to smaller, longer-term
      overcurrents
   6. Calibration screw - allows the manufacturer to precisely adjust the trip
      current of the device after assembly.
   7. Solenoid - separates contacts rapidly in response to high overcurrents
   8. Arc divider/extinguisher
**** Solid state[edit] ****
Solid-state circuit breakers, also known as digital circuit breakers are a
technological innovation which promises advance circuit breaker technology out
of the mechanical level, into the electrical. This promises several advantages,
such as cutting the circuit in fractions of microseconds, better monitoring of
circuit loads and longer lifetimes.[6]
**** Magnetic[edit] ****
Magnetic circuit breakers use a solenoid (electromagnet) whose pulling force
increases with the current. Certain designs utilize electromagnetic forces in
addition to those of the solenoid. The circuit breaker contacts are held closed
by a latch. As the current in the solenoid increases beyond the rating of the
circuit breaker, the solenoid's pull releases the latch, which lets the
contacts open by spring action. They are the most commonly used circuit
breakers in the USA.
**** Thermal-magnetic[edit] ****
Shihlin Electric MCCB with SHT
Thermal magnetic circuit breakers, which are the type found in most
distribution_boards in Europe and countries with a similar wiring arrangements,
incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously
to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding
to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of
the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit
breaker sooner for larger over currents but allows smaller overloads to persist
for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a
motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents
during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no
intentional additional delay.[7]
**** Magnetic-hydraulic[edit] ****
A magnetic-hydraulic circuit breaker uses a solenoid coil to provide operating
force to open the contacts. Magnetic-hydraulic breakers incorporate a hydraulic
time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the
current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, the speed of the
solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current
surges beyond normal running current for motor starting, energizing equipment,
etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the
latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient
temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a
magnetic breaker.[8]
Large power circuit breakers, applied in circuits of more than 1000 volts, may
incorporate hydraulic elements in the contact operating mechanism. Hydraulic
energy may be supplied by a pump, or stored in accumulators. These form a
distinct type from oil-filled circuit breakers where oil is the arc
extinguishing medium.[9]
**** Common trip (ganged) breakers[edit] ****
Three-pole common trip breaker for supplying a three-phase device. This breaker
has a 2 A rating.
To provide simultaneous breaking on multiple circuits from a fault on any one,
circuit breakers may be made as a ganged assembly. This is a very common
requirement for 3 phase systems, where breaking may be either 3 or 4 pole
(solid or switched neutral). Some makers make ganging kits to allow groups of
single phase breakers to be interlinked as required.
In the US, where split phase supplies are common, in branch circuits with more
than one live conductor, each live conductor must be protected by a breaker
pole. To ensure that all live conductors are interrupted when any pole trips, a
"common trip" breaker must be used. These may either contain two or three
tripping mechanisms within one case, or for small breakers, may externally tie
the poles together via their operating handles. Two-pole common trip breakers
are common on 120/240-volt systems where 240 volt loads (including major
appliances or further distribution boards) span the two live wires. Three-pole
common trip breakers are typically used to supply three-phase_electric_power to
large motors or further distribution boards.
Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if
the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a very
dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't
work), but wires remain live and some residual-current_devices (RCDs) may not
trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip).
This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching
is needed.
**** Shunt-trip units[edit] ****
A shunt-trip unit appears similar to a normal breaker and the moving actuators
are 'ganged' to a normal breaker mechanism to operate together in a similar
way, but the shunt trip is a solenoid intended to be operated by an external
constant voltage signal, rather than a current, commonly the local mains
voltage or   DC. These are often used to cut the power when a high risk event
occurs, such as a fire or flood alarm, or another electrical condition, such as
over voltage detection. Shunt trips may be a user fitted accessory to a
standard breaker, or supplied as an integral part of the circuit breaker.
**** Medium-voltage[edit] ****
An air circuit breaker of Siemens brand mounted on a motor control cubicle
Medium-voltage circuit breakers rated between 1 and 72 kV may be assembled into
metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, or may be individual
components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break circuit breakers
replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being
replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high
voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current
sensing protective relays operated through current_transformers. The
characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC
62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current
sensors and protective_relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or
magnetic overcurrent sensors.
Medium-voltage circuit breakers can be classified by the medium used to
extinguish the arc:
    * Vacuum_circuit_breakers—With rated current up to 6,300 A, and higher for
      generator circuit breakers application (up to 16,000 A & 140 kA). These
      breakers interrupt the current by creating and extinguishing the arc in a
      vacuum container - aka "bottle". Long life bellows are designed to travel
      the 6â10 mm the contacts must part. These are generally applied for
      voltages up to about 40,500 V,[10] which corresponds roughly to the
      medium-voltage range of power systems. Vacuum circuit breakers have
      longer life expectancy between overhaul than do other circuit breakers.
      In addition their global_warming_potential is by far lower than SF6
      circuit_breaker.
    * Air circuit breakers—Rated current up to 6,300 A and higher for generator
      circuit breakers. Trip characteristics are often fully adjustable
      including configurable trip thresholds and delays. Usually electronically
      controlled, though some models are microprocessor controlled via an
      integral electronic trip unit. Often used for main power distribution in
      large industrial plant, where the breakers are arranged in draw-out
      enclosures for ease of maintenance.
    * SF6_circuit_breakers extinguish the arc in a chamber filled with sulfur
      hexafluoride gas.
Medium-voltage circuit breakers may be connected into the circuit by bolted
connections to bus bars or wires, especially in outdoor switchyards. Medium-
voltage circuit breakers in switchgear line-ups are often built with draw-out
construction, allowing breaker removal without disturbing power circuit
connections, using a motor-operated or hand-cranked mechanism to separate the
breaker from its enclosure.
**** High-voltage[edit] ****
Main article: High-voltage_switchgear
Three single-phase Soviet/Russian 110-kV oil circuit breakers
400 kV SF6 live-tank circuit breakers
72.5 kV hybrid_switchgear_module
Electrical power_transmission networks are protected and controlled by high-
voltage breakers. The definition of high voltage varies but in power
transmission work is usually thought to be 72.5 kV or higher, according to a
recent definition by the International_Electrotechnical_Commission (IEC). High-
voltage breakers are nearly always solenoid-operated, with current sensing
protective_relays operated through current_transformers. In substations the
protective relay scheme can be complex, protecting equipment and buses from
various types of overload or ground/earth fault.
High-voltage breakers are broadly classified by the medium used to extinguish
the arc:
    * Bulk oil
    * Minimum oil
    * Air blast
    * Vacuum
    * SF6
    * CO2
Due to environmental and cost concerns over insulating oil spills, most new
breakers use SF6 gas to quench the arc.
Circuit breakers can be classified as live tank, where the enclosure that
contains the breaking mechanism is at line potential, or dead tank with the
enclosure at earth potential. High-voltage AC circuit breakers are routinely
available with ratings up to 765 kV. 1,200 kV breakers were launched by Siemens
in November 2011,[11] followed by ABB in April the following year.[12]
High-voltage circuit breakers used on transmission systems may be arranged to
allow a single pole of a three-phase line to trip, instead of tripping all
three poles; for some classes of faults this improves the system stability and
availability.
High-voltage_direct_current circuit breakers are still a field of research as
of 2015. Such breakers would be useful to interconnect HVDC transmission
systems.[13]
**** Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) high-voltage[edit] ****
Main article: Sulfur_hexafluoride_circuit_breaker
A sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker uses contacts surrounded by sulfur
hexafluoride gas to quench the arc. They are most often used for transmission-
level voltages and may be incorporated into compact gas-insulated switchgear.
In cold climates, supplemental heating or de-rating of the circuit breakers may
be required due to liquefaction of the SF6 gas.
**** Disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB)[edit] ****
72.5 kV carbon dioxide high-voltage circuit breaker
The disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB) was introduced in 2000[14] and is a
high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. It presents a
technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the
breaking chamber, eliminating the need for separate disconnectors. This
increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts
need maintenance every 2â6 years, while modern circuit breakers have
maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the
space requirements within the substation, and increases the reliability, due to
the lack of separate disconnectors.[15][16]
In order to further reduce the required space of substation, as well as
simplifying the design and engineering of the substation, a fiber_optic_current
sensor (FOCS) can be integrated with the DCB. A 420 kV DCB with integrated FOCS
can reduce a substation's footprint with over 50% compared to a conventional
solution of live_tank_breakers with disconnectors and current_transformers, due
to reduced material and no additional insulation medium.[17]
**** Carbon dioxide (CO2) high-voltage[edit] ****
In 2012 ABB presented a 75 kV high-voltage breaker that uses carbon dioxide as
the medium to extinguish the arc. The carbon dioxide breaker works on the same
principles as an SF6 breaker and can also be produced as a disconnecting
circuit breaker. By switching from SF6 to CO2 it is possible to reduce the CO2
emissions by 10 tons during the product's life cycle.[18]
***** "Smart" circuit breakers[edit] *****
Several firms have looked at adding monitoring for appliances via electronics
or using a digital circuit breaker to monitor the breakers remotely. Utility
companies in the United States have been reviewing use of the technology to
turn on and off appliances, as well as potentially turning off charging of
electric cars during periods of high electrical grid load. These devices under
research and testing would have wireless capability to monitor the electrical
in a house via a smartphone app or other means.[19]
***** Other breakers[edit] *****
Residual_current_circuit_breaker with overload protection
The following types are described in separate articles.
    * Breakers for protections against earth faults too small to trip an over-
      current device:
          o RCCB (Residual Current Operated Circuit-Breaker without Integral
            Overcurrent Protection) as a type of Residual-current_device (RCD,
            formerly known as a residual current device) â detects current
            imbalance, but does not provide over-current protection. In the
            United States and Canada these are called ground fault circuit
            interrupters (GFCI).
          o Residual current breaker with over-current protection (RCBO) â
            combines the functions of an RCD and an MCB in one package. In the
            United States and Canada these are called GFCI breakers.
          o Earth_leakage_circuit_breaker (ELCB) â This detects current in
            the earth wire directly rather than detecting imbalance. They are
            no longer seen in new installations as they cannot detect any
            dangerous condition where the current is returning to earth by
            another route - such as via a person on the ground or via plumbing.
            (also called VOELCB in the UK).
    * Recloser â A type of circuit breaker that closes automatically after a
      delay. These are used on overhead electric_power_distribution systems, to
      prevent short duration faults from causing sustained outages.
    * Polyswitch (polyfuse) â A small device commonly described as an
      automatically resetting fuse rather than a circuit breaker.
