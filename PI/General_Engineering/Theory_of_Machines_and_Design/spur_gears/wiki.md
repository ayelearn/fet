Two meshing gears transmitting rotational motion. Note that the smaller gear is
rotating faster. Since the larger gear is rotating less quickly, its torque is
proportionally greater. One subtlety of this particular arrangement is that the
linear speed at the pitch diameter is the same on both gears.

A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth, or in the case
of a cogwheel, inserted teeth (called cogs), which mesh with another toothed
part to transmit torque. Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and
direction of a power_source. Gears almost always produce a change in torque,
creating a mechanical_advantage, through their gear_ratio, and thus may be
considered a simple_machine. The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the
same shape.[1] Two or more meshing gears, working in a sequence, are called a
gear_train or a transmission. A gear can mesh with a linear toothed part,
called a rack, producing translation instead of rotation.
The gears in a transmission are analogous to the wheels in a crossed, belt
pulley system. An advantage of gears is that the teeth of a gear prevent
slippage.
When two gears mesh, if one gear is bigger than the other, a mechanical
advantage is produced, with the rotational_speeds, and the torques, of the two
gears differing in proportion to their diameters.
In transmissions with multiple gear ratiosâsuch as bicycles, motorcycles, and
carsâthe term "gear" as in "first gear" refers to a gear ratio rather than an
actual physical gear. The term describes similar devices, even when the gear
ratio is continuous rather than discrete, or when the device does not actually
contain gears, as in a continuously_variable_transmission.[2]

***** History[edit] *****
Early examples of gears date from the 4th century BC in China[3] (Zhan Guo
times â Late East Zhou_dynasty), which have been preserved at the Luoyang
Museum of Henan Province, China. The earliest preserved gears in Europe were
found in the Antikythera_mechanism, an example of a very early and intricate
geared device, designed to calculate astronomical positions. Its time of
construction is now estimated between 150 and 100 BC.[4] Gears appear in works
connected to Hero_of_Alexandria, in Roman_Egypt circa AD 50,[5] but can be
traced back to the mechanics of the Alexandrian_school in 3rd-century BC
Ptolemaic_Egypt, and were greatly developed by the Greek polymath Archimedes
(287â212 BC).[6]
Single-stage gear reducer
The segmental gear, which receives/communicates reciprocating_motion from/to a
cogwheel, consisting of a sector of a circular gear/ring having cogs on the
periphery,[7] was invented by Arab engineer Al-Jazari in 1206.[8] The worm_gear
was invented in the Indian_subcontinent, for use in roller cotton_gins, some
time during the 13thâ14th centuries.[9] Differential gears may have been used
in some of the Chinese south-pointing_chariots,[10] but the first verifiable
use of differential gears was by the British clock maker Joseph Williamson in
1720.
Examples of early gear applications include:
    * The Antikythera_mechanism (2nd century BC)
    * Ma_Jun (c. 200â265 AD) used gears as part of a south-pointing_chariot.
    * The first geared mechanical_clocks were built in China in 725.
    * Al-Jazari (c. 1206) invented the segmental gear as part of a water-
      lifting device.[8]
    * The worm_gear was invented as part of a roller cotton_gin in the Indian
      subcontinent (c. 13thâ14th centuries).[9]
    * The 1386 Salisbury_cathedral_clock may be the world's oldest still
      working geared mechanical clock.
***** Etymology[edit] *****
Wooden cogwheel driving a lantern pinion or cage gear
A cast gearwheel (above) meshing with a cogged mortise wheel (below). The
wooden cogs are held in place by nails.
A cog is a tooth on a wheel. From Middle_English cogge, from Old_Norse (compare
Norwegian kugg ('cog'), Swedish kugg, kugge ('cog, tooth')), from Proto-
Germanic *kuggÅ (compare Dutch kogge ('cogboat'), German Kock), from Proto-
Indo-European *gugÄ ('hump, ball') (compare Lithuanian gugÃ  ('pommel, hump,
hill'), from PIE *gÄw- ('to bend, arch').[11]
Historically, cogs were teeth made of wood rather than metal, and a cogwheel
technically consisted of a series of wooden gear teeth located around a mortise
(or mortice) wheel, each tooth forming a type of specialised 'through'_mortise
and_tenon joint. The wheel can be made of wood, cast_iron, or other material.
Wooden cogs were formerly used when large metal gears could not be cut, when
the cast tooth was not even approximately of the proper shape, or the size of
the wheel made manufacture impractical.[12]
The cogs were often made of maple wood. In 1967 the Thompson Manufacturing
Company of Lancaster,_New_Hampshire still had a very active business in
supplying tens of thousands of maple gear teeth per year, mostly for use in
paper_mills and grist_mills, some dating back over 100 years.[13] Since a
wooden cog performs exactly the same function as a cast or machined metal
tooth, the word was applied by extension to both, and the distinction has been
generally lost.
***** Comparison with drive mechanisms[edit] *****
The definite ratio that teeth give gears provides an advantage over other
drives (such as traction drives and V-belts) in precision machines such as
watches that depend upon an exact velocity ratio. In cases where driver and
follower are proximal, gears also have an advantage over other drives in the
reduced number of parts required. The downside is that gears are more expensive
to manufacture and their lubrication requirements may impose a higher operating
cost per hour.
***** Types[edit] *****
**** External vs internal gears[edit] ****
Internal gear
An external gear is one with the teeth formed on the outer surface of a
cylinder or cone. Conversely, an internal gear is one with the teeth formed on
the inner surface of a cylinder or cone. For bevel_gears, an internal gear is
one with the pitch angle exceeding 90 degrees. Internal gears do not cause
output shaft direction reversal.[14]
**** Spur[edit] ****
Spur gear
Spur gears or straight-cut gears are the simplest type of gear. They consist of
a cylinder or disk with teeth projecting radially. Though the teeth are not
straight-sided (but usually of special form to achieve a constant drive ratio,
mainly involute but less commonly cycloidal), the edge of each tooth is
straight and aligned parallel to the axis of rotation. These gears mesh
together correctly only if fitted to parallel shafts.[15] No axial thrust is
created by the tooth loads. Spur gears are excellent at moderate speeds but
tend to be noisy at high speeds.[16]
**** Helical[edit] ****
An external contact helical gear in action
Helical gears
Top: parallel configuration
Bottom: crossed configuration
Helical or "dry fixed" gears offer a refinement over spur gears. The leading
edges of the teeth are not parallel to the axis of rotation, but are set at an
angle. Since the gear is curved, this angling makes the tooth shape a segment
of a helix. Helical gears can be meshed in parallel or crossed orientations.
The former refers to when the shafts are parallel to each other; this is the
most common orientation. In the latter, the shafts are non-parallel, and in
this configuration the gears are sometimes known as "skew gears".
The angled teeth engage more gradually than do spur gear teeth, causing them to
run more smoothly and quietly.[17] With parallel helical gears, each pair of
teeth first make contact at a single point at one side of the gear wheel; a
moving curve of contact then grows gradually across the tooth face to a
maximum, then recedes until the teeth break contact at a single point on the
opposite side. In spur gears, teeth suddenly meet at a line contact across
their entire width, causing stress and noise. Spur gears make a characteristic
whine at high speeds. For this reason spur gears are used in low-speed
applications and in situations where noise control is not a problem, and
helical gears are used in high-speed applications, large power transmission, or
where noise_abatement is important.[18] The speed is considered high when the
pitch line velocity exceeds 25 m/s.[19]
A disadvantage of helical gears is a resultant thrust along the axis of the
gear, which must be accommodated by appropriate thrust_bearings, and a greater
degree of sliding_friction between the meshing teeth, often addressed with
additives in the lubricant.
*** Skew gears[edit] ***
For a "crossed" or "skew" configuration, the gears must have the same pressure
angle and normal pitch; however, the helix angle and handedness can be
different. The relationship between the two shafts is actually defined by the
helix angle(s) of the two shafts and the handedness, as defined:[20]
         E =  &#x03B2;  1   +  &#x03B2;  2     {\displaystyle E=\beta _
      {1}+\beta _{2}}  [E=\beta _{1}+\beta _{2}] for gears of the same
      handedness,
         E =  &#x03B2;  1   &#x2212;  &#x03B2;  2     {\displaystyle E=\beta _
      {1}-\beta _{2}}  [E=\beta _{1}-\beta _{2}] for gears of opposite
      handedness,
where     &#x03B2;   {\displaystyle \beta }  [\beta ] is the helix angle for
the gear. The crossed configuration is less mechanically sound because there is
only a point contact between the gears, whereas in the parallel configuration
there is a line contact.[20]
Quite commonly, helical gears are used with the helix angle of one having the
negative of the helix angle of the other; such a pair might also be referred to
as having a right-handed helix and a left-handed helix of equal angles. The two
equal but opposite angles add to zero: the angle between shafts is zeroâthat
is, the shafts are parallel. Where the sum or the difference (as described in
the equations above) is not zero, the shafts are crossed. For shafts crossed at
right angles, the helix angles are of the same hand because they must add to 90
degrees. (This is the case with the gears in the illustration above: they mesh
correctly in the crossed configuration: for the parallel configuration, one of
the helix angles should be reversed. The gears illustrated cannot mesh with the
shafts parallel.)

**** Double helical[edit] ****
Herringbone gears
Double helical gears overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single
helical gears by using a double set of teeth, slanted in opposite directions. A
double helical gear can be thought of as two mirrored helical gears mounted
closely together on a common axle. This arrangement cancels out the net axial
thrust, since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction,
resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can also remove the
need for thrust bearings. However, double helical gears are more difficult to
manufacture due to their more complicated shape.
Herringbone_gears are a special type of helical gears. They do not have a
groove in the middle like some other double helical gears do; the two mirrored
helical gears are joined together so that their teeth form a V shape. This can
also be applied to bevel_gears, as in the final_drive of the CitroÃ«n_Type_A.
For both possible rotational directions, there exist two possible arrangements
for the oppositely-oriented helical gears or gear faces. One arrangement is
called stable, and the other unstable. In a stable arrangement, the helical
gear faces are oriented so that each axial force is directed toward the center
of the gear. In an unstable arrangement, both axial forces are directed away
from the center of the gear. In either arrangement, the total (or net) axial
force on each gear is zero when the gears are aligned correctly. If the gears
become misaligned in the axial direction, the unstable arrangement generates a
net force that may lead to disassembly of the gear train, while the stable
arrangement generates a net corrective force. If the direction of rotation is
reversed, the direction of the axial thrusts is also reversed, so a stable
configuration becomes unstable, and conversely.
Stable double helical gears can be directly interchanged with spur gears
without any need for different bearings.
**** Bevel[edit] ****
Main article: Bevel_gear
Bevel gear operating a lock_gate
Wooden cogs set in bevel mortise wheels driving a millstone. Note wooden spur
gears in the background.
A bevel gear is shaped like a_right_circular_cone_with_most_of_its_tip_cut_off.
When two bevel gears mesh, their imaginary vertices must occupy the same point.
Their shaft axes also intersect at this point, forming an arbitrary non-
straight angle between the shafts. The angle between the shafts can be anything
except zero or 180 degrees. Bevel gears with equal numbers of teeth and shaft
axes at 90 degrees are called miter (US) or mitre (UK) gears.
**** Spiral bevels[edit] ****
Spiral bevel gears
Main article: Spiral_bevel_gear
Spiral bevel gears can be manufactured as Gleason types (circular arc with non-
constant tooth depth), Oerlikon and Curvex types (circular arc with constant
tooth depth), Klingelnberg Cyclo-Palloid (Epicycloid with constant tooth depth)
or Klingelnberg Palloid. Spiral bevel gears have the same advantages and
disadvantages relative to their straight-cut cousins as helical gears do to
spur gears. Straight bevel gears are generally used only at speeds below 5 m/s
(1000 ft/min), or, for small gears, 1000 r.p.m.[21]
Note: The cylindrical gear tooth profile corresponds to an involute, but the
bevel gear tooth profile to an octoid. All traditional bevel gear generators
(like Gleason, Klingelnberg, Heidenreich & Harbeck, WMW Modul) manufacture
bevel gears with an octoidal tooth profile. IMPORTANT: For 5-axis milled bevel
gear sets it is important to choose the same calculation / layout like the
conventional manufacturing method. Simplified calculated bevel gears on the
basis of an equivalent cylindrical gear in normal section with an involute
tooth form show a deviant tooth form with reduced tooth strength by 10-28%
without offset and 45% with offset [Diss. HÃ¼necke, TU Dresden]. Furthermore,
the "involute bevel gear sets" cause more noise.
**** Hypoid[edit] ****
Hypoid gear
Hypoid gears resemble spiral bevel gears except the shaft axes do not
intersect. The pitch surfaces appear conical but, to compensate for the offset
shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution.[22][23] Hypoid gears are almost
always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side
the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between
hypoid gear teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with spiral bevel
gear teeth, but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it
rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear
oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally
designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also,
the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral bevel pinion, with
the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set
of hypoid gears.[24] This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive
trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-
pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle
drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does.
Bringing hypoid gears to market for mass-production applications was an
engineering improvement of the 1920s.
**** Crown[edit] ****
Crown gear
Main article: Crown_gear
Crown gears or contrate gears are a particular form of bevel gear whose teeth
project at right angles to the plane of the wheel; in their orientation the
teeth resemble the points on a crown. A crown gear can only mesh accurately
with another bevel gear, although crown gears are sometimes seen meshing with
spur gears. A crown gear is also sometimes meshed with an escapement such as
found in mechanical clocks.
**** Worm[edit] ****
Worm gear
4-start worm and wheel
Main articles: Worm_drive and Slewing_drive
Worms resemble screws. A worm is meshed with a worm wheel, which looks similar
to a spur_gear.
Worm-and-gear sets are a simple and compact way to achieve a high torque, low
speed gear ratio. For example, helical gears are normally limited to gear
ratios of less than 10:1 while worm-and-gear sets vary from 10:1 to 500:1.[25]
A disadvantage is the potential for considerable sliding action, leading to low
efficiency.[26]
A worm gear is a species of helical gear, but its helix angle is usually
somewhat large (close to 90 degrees) and its body is usually fairly long in the
axial direction. These attributes give it screw like qualities. The distinction
between a worm and a helical gear is that at least one tooth persists for a
full rotation around the helix. If this occurs, it is a 'worm'; if not, it is a
'helical gear'. A worm may have as few as one tooth. If that tooth persists for
several turns around the helix, the worm appears, superficially, to have more
than one tooth, but what one in fact sees is the same tooth reappearing at
intervals along the length of the worm. The usual screw nomenclature applies: a
one-toothed worm is called single thread or single start; a worm with more than
one tooth is called multiple thread or multiple start. The helix angle of a
worm is not usually specified. Instead, the lead angle, which is equal to 90
degrees minus the helix angle, is given.
In a worm-and-gear set, the worm can always drive the gear. However, if the
gear attempts to drive the worm, it may or may not succeed. Particularly if the
lead angle is small, the gear's teeth may simply lock against the worm's teeth,
because the force component circumferential to the worm is not sufficient to
overcome friction. In traditional music boxes, however, the gear drives the
worm, which has a large helix angle. This mesh drives the speed-limiter vanes
which are mounted on the worm shaft.
Worm-and-gear sets that do lock are called self locking, which can be used to
advantage, as when it is desired to set the position of a mechanism by turning
the worm and then have the mechanism hold that position. An example is the
machine_head found on some types of stringed_instruments.
If the gear in a worm-and-gear set is an ordinary helical gear only a single
point of contact is achieved.[24][27] If medium to high power transmission is
desired, the tooth shape of the gear is modified to achieve more intimate
contact by making both gears partially envelop each other. This is done by
making both concave and joining them at a saddle_point; this is called a cone-
drive[28] or "Double enveloping".
Worm gears can be right or left-handed, following the long-established practice
for screw threads.[14]

**** Non-circular[edit] ****
Non-circular gears
Main article: Non-circular_gear
Non-circular gears are designed for special purposes. While a regular gear is
optimized to transmit torque to another engaged member with minimum noise and
wear and maximum efficiency, a non-circular gear's main objective might be
ratio variations, axle displacement oscillations and more. Common applications
include textile machines, potentiometers and continuously_variable
transmissions.
**** Rack and pinion[edit] ****
Rack and pinion gearing
Main article: Rack_and_pinion
A rack is a toothed bar or rod that can be thought of as a sector gear with an
infinitely large radius of curvature. Torque can be converted to linear force
by meshing a rack with a pinion: the pinion turns; the rack moves in a straight
line. Such a mechanism is used in automobiles to convert the rotation of the
steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the tie rod(s). Racks also
feature in the theory of gear geometry, where, for instance, the tooth shape of
an interchangeable set of gears may be specified for the rack, (infinite
radius), and the tooth shapes for gears of particular actual radii are then
derived from that. The rack and pinion gear type is employed in a rack_railway.
**** Epicyclic[edit] ****
Epicyclic gearing
Main article: Epicyclic_gearing
In epicyclic gearing one or more of the gear axes moves. Examples are sun and
planet gearing (see below), cycloidal_drive, and mechanical_differentials.
*** Sun and planet[edit] ***
Sun (yellow) and planet (red) gearing
Main article: Sun_and_planet_gear
Sun_and_planet_gearing is a method of converting reciprocating_motion into
rotary_motion that was used in steam_engines. James_Watt used it on his early
steam engines to get around the patent on the crank, but it also provided the
advantage of increasing the flywheel speed so Watt could use a lighter
flywheel.
In the illustration, the sun is yellow, the planet red, the reciprocating arm
is blue, the flywheel is green and the driveshaft is gray.
**** Harmonic gear[edit] ****
Harmonic gearing
Main article: Harmonic_Drive
A harmonic gear or strain_wave_gear is a specialized gearing mechanism often
used in industrial motion_control, robotics and aerospace for its advantages
over traditional gearing systems, including lack of backlash, compactness and
high gear ratios.
**** Cage gear[edit] ****
Cage gear in Pantigo Windmill, Long Island (with the driving gearwheel
disengaged)
A cage gear, also called a lantern gear or lantern pinion, has cylindrical rods
for teeth, parallel to the axle and arranged in a circle around it, much as the
bars on a round bird cage or lantern. The assembly is held together by disks at
each end, into which the tooth rods and axle are set. Cage gears are more
efficient than solid pinions,[citation_needed] and dirt can fall through the
rods rather than becoming trapped and increasing wear. They can be constructed
with very simple tools as the teeth are not formed by cutting or milling, but
rather by drilling holes and inserting rods.
Sometimes used in clocks, the cage gear should always be driven by a gearwheel,
not used as the driver. The cage gear was not initially favoured by
conservative clock makers. It became popular in turret clocks where dirty
working conditions were most commonplace. Domestic American clock movements
often used them.
**** Cycloidal gear[edit] ****
Main article: Cycloid_gear
**** Magnetic gear[edit] ****
Main article: magnetic_coupling
Main article: Magnetic_gear
All cogs of each gear component of magnetic gears act as a constant magnet with
periodic alternation of opposite magnetic poles on mating surfaces. Gear
components are mounted with a backlash capability similar to other mechanical
gearings. Although they cannot exert as much force as a traditional gear, such
gears work without touching and so are immune to wear, have very low noise and
can slip without damage making them very reliable.[29] They can be used in
configurations that are not possible for gears that must be physically touching
and can operate with a non-metallic barrier completely separating the driving
force from the load. The magnetic_coupling can transmit force into a
hermetically_sealed enclosure without using a radial_shaft_seal, which may
leak.
***** Nomenclature[edit] *****
Main article: Gear_nomenclature
**** General nomenclature[edit] ****
[Gear_words.png]
  Rotational frequency, n 
      Measured in rotation over time, such as revolutions_per_minute (RPM or
      rpm).
  Angular_frequency, Ï 
      Measured in radians/second. 1 RPM = 2Ï rad/minute = Ï/30 rad/second.
  Number of teeth, N 
      How many teeth a gear has, an integer. In the case of worms, it is the
      number of thread starts that the worm has.
  Gear, wheel 
      The larger of two interacting gears or a gear on its own.
  Pinion 
      The smaller of two interacting gears.
  Path of contact 
      Path followed by the point of contact between two meshing gear teeth.
  Line of action, pressure line 
      Line along which the force between two meshing gear teeth is directed. It
      has the same direction as the force vector. In general, the line of
      action changes from moment to moment during the period of engagement of a
      pair of teeth. For involute_gears, however, the tooth-to-tooth force is
      always directed along the same lineâthat is, the line of action is
      constant. This implies that for involute gears the path of contact is
      also a straight line, coincident with the line of actionâas is indeed
      the case.
  Axis 
      Axis of revolution of the gear; center line of the shaft.
  Pitch point 
      Point where the line of action crosses a line joining the two gear axes.
  Pitch circle, pitch line 
      Circle centered on and perpendicular to the axis, and passing through the
      pitch point. A predefined diametral position on the gear where the
      circular tooth thickness, pressure angle and helix angles are defined.
  Pitch diameter, d 
      A predefined diametral position on the gear where the circular tooth
      thickness, pressure angle and helix angles are defined. The standard
      pitch diameter is a basic dimension and cannot be measured, but is a
      location where other measurements are made. Its value is based on the
      number of teeth, the normal module (or normal diametral pitch), and the
      helix angle. It is calculated as:
         d =    N  m  n     cos &#x2061; &#x03C8;      {\displaystyle d={\frac
      {Nm_{n}}{\cos \psi }}}  [d={\frac {Nm_{n}}{\cos \psi }}] in metric units
      or     d =   N   P  d   cos &#x2061; &#x03C8;      {\displaystyle d=
      {\frac {N}{P_{d}\cos \psi }}}  [d={\frac {N}{P_{d}\cos \psi }}] in
      imperial units.[30]
  Module or modulus, m 
      Since it is impractical to calculate circular pitch with irrational
      numbers, mechanical engineers usually use a scaling factor that replaces
      it with a regular value instead. This is known as the module or modulus
      of the wheel and is simply defined as
         m = p  /  &#x03C0;   {\displaystyle m=p/\pi }  [m=p/\pi ]
      where m is the module and p the circular pitch. The units of module are
      customarily millimeters; an English Module is sometimes used with the
      units of inches. When the diametral pitch, DP, is in English units,
         m = 25.4  /  D P   {\displaystyle m=25.4/DP}  [m=25.4/DP] in
      conventional metric units.
      The distance between the two axis becomes
         a = m (  z  1   +  z  2   )  /  2   {\displaystyle a=m(z_{1}+z_{2})/2}
      [a= m(z_1 + z_2)/2]
      where a is the axis distance, z1 and z2 are the number of cogs (teeth)
      for each of the two wheels (gears). These numbers (or at least one of
      them) is often chosen among primes to create an even contact between
      every cog of both wheels, and thereby avoid unnecessary wear and damage.
      An even uniform gear wear is achieved by ensuring the tooth counts of the
      two gears meshing together are relatively_prime to each other; this
      occurs when the greatest_common_divisor_(GCD) of each gear tooth count
      equals 1, e.g. GCD(16,25)=1; if a 1:1 gear ratio is desired a relatively
      prime gear may be inserted in between the two gears; this maintains the
      1:1 ratio but reverses the gear direction; a second relatively prime gear
      could also be inserted to restore the original rotational direction while
      maintaining uniform wear with all 4 gears in this case. Mechanical
      engineers, at least in continental Europe, usually use the module instead
      of circular pitch. The module, just like the circular pitch, can be used
      for all types of cogs, not just evolvent based straight cogs.[31]
  Operating pitch diameters 
      Diameters determined from the number of teeth and the center distance at
      which gears operate.[14] Example for pinion:
          d  w   =    2 a   u + 1    =    2 a      z  2    z  1     + 1    .
      {\displaystyle d_{w}={\frac {2a}{u+1}}={\frac {2a}{{\frac {z_{2}}{z_
      {1}}}+1}}.}  [ d_w = \frac{2a}{u+1} = \frac{2a}{\frac{z_2}{z_1}+1}. ]
  Pitch surface 
      In cylindrical gears, cylinder formed by projecting a pitch circle in the
      axial direction. More generally, the surface formed by the sum of all the
      pitch circles as one moves along the axis. For bevel gears it is a cone.

      force on each other, and the line joining the centers of the two gears.
      For involute gears, the teeth always exert force along the line of
      action, which, for involute gears, is a straight line; and thus, for
      involute gears, the pressure angle is constant.

      2}  [a=(D_o-D)/2]
  Dedendum, b 
      Radial distance from the depth of the tooth trough to the pitch surface.

      adjacent tooth on the same gear, measured along the pitch circle.
  Diametral pitch, DP 
         D P = N  /  d = &#x03C0;  /  p   {\displaystyle DP=N/d=\pi /p}  [DP=N/
      d=\pi/p]
      Ratio of the number of teeth to the pitch diameter. Could be measured in
      teeth per inch or teeth per centimeter, but conventionally has units of
      per inch of diameter. Where the module, m, is in metric units
         D P = 25.4  /  m   {\displaystyle DP=25.4/m}  [DP=25.4/m] in English
      units

      Angle between a tangent to the helix and the gear axis. It is zero in the
      limiting case of a spur gear, albeit it can considered as the hypotenuse

      selected, not necessarily the standard pitch diameter.
  Chordal addendum (chordal height) 
      Height from the top of the tooth to the chord subtending the circular

**** Pitch nomenclature[edit] ****
For other uses, see Pitch.
Pitch is the distance between a point on one tooth and the corresponding point
on an adjacent tooth.[14] It is a dimension measured along a line or curve in
the transverse, normal, or axial directions. The use of the single word pitch
without qualification may be ambiguous, and for this reason it is preferable to
use specific designations such as transverse circular pitch, normal base pitch,
axial pitch.
    * Pitch
    * Tooth pitch
    * Base pitch relationships
    * Principal pitches
  Circular pitch, p 
      Arc distance along a specified pitch circle or pitch line between
      corresponding profiles of adjacent teeth.
  Transverse circular pitch, pt 
      Circular pitch in the transverse plane.
  Normal circular pitch, pn, pe 
      Circular pitch in the normal plane, and also the length of the arc along
      the normal pitch helix between helical teeth or threads.
  Axial pitch, px 
      Linear pitch in an axial plane and in a pitch surface. In helical gears
      and worms, axial pitch has the same value at all diameters. In gearing of
      other types, axial pitch may be confined to the pitch surface and may be
      a circular measurement. The term axial pitch is preferred to the term
      linear pitch. The axial pitch of a helical worm and the circular pitch of
      its worm gear are the same.
  Normal base pitch, pN, pbn
      An involute helical gear is the base pitch in the normal plane. It is the
      normal distance between parallel helical involute surfaces on the plane
      of action in the normal plane, or is the length of arc on the normal base
      helix. It is a constant distance in any helical involute gear.
  Transverse base pitch, pb, pbt 
      In an involute gear, the pitch is on the base circle or along the line of
      action. Corresponding sides of involute gear teeth are parallel curves,
      and the base pitch is the constant and fundamental distance between them
      along a common normal in a transverse plane.
  Diametral pitch (transverse), Pd 
      Ratio of the number of teeth to the standard pitch diameter in inches.

***** Backlash[edit] *****
Main article: Backlash_(engineering)
Backlash is the error in motion that occurs when gears change direction. It
exists because there is always some gap between the trailing face of the
driving tooth and the leading face of the tooth behind it on the driven gear,
and that gap must be closed before force can be transferred in the new
direction. The term "backlash" can also be used to refer to the size of the
gap, not just the phenomenon it causes; thus, one could speak of a pair of
gears as having, for example, "0.1 mm of backlash." A pair of gears could be
designed to have zero backlash, but this would presuppose perfection in
manufacturing, uniform thermal expansion characteristics throughout the system,
and no lubricant. Therefore, gear pairs are designed to have some backlash. It
is usually provided by reducing the tooth thickness of each gear by half the
desired gap distance. In the case of a large gear and a small pinion, however,
the backlash is usually taken entirely off the gear and the pinion is given
full sized teeth. Backlash can also be provided by moving the gears further
apart. The backlash of a gear_train equals the sum of the backlash of each pair
of gears, so in long trains backlash can become a problem.
For situations that require precision, such as instrumentation and control,
backlash can be minimised through one of several techniques. For instance, the
gear can be split along a plane perpendicular to the axis, one half fixed to
the shaft in the usual manner, the other half placed alongside it, free to
rotate about the shaft, but with springs between the two halves providing
relative torque between them, so that one achieves, in effect, a single gear
with expanding teeth. Another method involves tapering the teeth in the axial
direction and letting the gear slide in the axial direction to take up slack.
***** Shifting of gears[edit] *****
In some machines (e.g., automobiles) it is necessary to alter the gear ratio to
suit the task, a process known as gear shifting or changing gear. There are
several ways of shifting gears, for example:
    * Manual_transmission
    * Automatic_transmission
    * Derailleur_gears, which are actually sprockets in combination with a
      roller_chain
    * Hub_gears (also called epicyclic gearing or sun-and-planet gears)
There are several outcomes of gear shifting in motor vehicles. In the case of
vehicle_noise_emissions, there are higher sound_levels emitted when the vehicle
is engaged in lower gears. The design life of the lower ratio gears is shorter,
so cheaper gears may be used, which tend to generate more noise due to smaller
overlap ratio and a lower mesh stiffness etc. than the helical gears used for
the high ratios. This fact has been used to analyze vehicle-generated sound
since the late 1960s, and has been incorporated into the simulation of urban
roadway noise and corresponding design of urban noise_barriers along roadways.
[32]
***** Tooth profile[edit] *****
    * Profile of a spur gear
    * Undercut
A profile is one side of a tooth in a cross section between the outside circle
and the root circle. Usually a profile is the curve of intersection of a tooth
surface and a plane or surface normal to the pitch surface, such as the
transverse, normal, or axial plane.
The fillet curve (root fillet) is the concave portion of the tooth profile
where it joins the bottom of the tooth space.2
As mentioned near the beginning of the article, the attainment of a
nonfluctuating velocity ratio is dependent on the profile of the teeth.
Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the tooth profile.
There are a great many tooth profiles that provide constant velocity ratios. In
many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a tooth
profile for the mating gear that provides a constant velocity ratio. However,
two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern
times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late
1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in
drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and
flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to
manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary
over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. Cycloidal
gears only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. Cycloidal
gears are still used in mechanical clocks.
An undercut is a condition in generated gear teeth when any part of the fillet
curve lies inside of a line drawn tangent to the working profile at its point
of juncture with the fillet. Undercut may be deliberately introduced to
facilitate finishing operations. With undercut the fillet curve intersects the
working profile. Without undercut the fillet curve and the working profile have
a common tangent.
***** Gear materials[edit] *****
Wooden gears of a historic windmill
Numerous nonferrous alloys, cast irons, powder-metallurgy and plastics are used
in the manufacture of gears. However, steels are most commonly used because of
their high strength-to-weight ratio and low cost. Plastic is commonly used
where cost or weight is a concern. A properly designed plastic gear can replace
steel in many cases because it has many desirable properties, including dirt
tolerance, low speed meshing, the ability to "skip" quite well[33] and the
ability to be made with materials that don't need additional lubrication.
Manufacturers have used plastic gears to reduce costs in consumer items
including copy machines, optical storage devices, cheap dynamos, consumer audio
equipment, servo motors, and printers. Another advantage of the use of
plastics, formerly (such as in the 1980s), was the reduction of repair costs
for certain expensive machines. In cases of severe jamming (as of the paper in
a printer), the plastic gear teeth would be torn free of their substrate,
allowing the drive mechanism to then spin freely (instead of damaging itself by
straining against the jam). This use of "sacrificial" gear teeth avoided
destroying the much more expensive motor and related parts. This method has
been superseded, in more recent designs, by the use of clutches and torque- or
current-limited motors.
***** Standard pitches and the module system[edit] *****
Although gears can be made with any pitch, for convenience and
interchangeability standard pitches are frequently used. Pitch is a property
associated with linear dimensions and so differs whether the standard values
are in the imperial (inch) or metric systems. Using inch measurements, standard
diametral pitch values with units of "per inch" are chosen; the diametral pitch
is the number of teeth on a gear of one inch pitch diameter. Common standard
values for spur gears are 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 72,
80, 96, 100, 120, and 200.[34] Certain standard pitches such as 1/10 and 1/20
in inch measurements, which mesh with linear rack, are actually (linear)
circular pitch values with units of "inches"[34]
When gear dimensions are in the metric system the pitch specification is
generally in terms of module or modulus, which is effectively a length
measurement across the pitch diameter. The term module is understood to mean
the pitch diameter in millimeters divided by the number of teeth. When the
module is based upon inch measurements, it is known as the English module to
avoid confusion with the metric module. Module is a direct dimension, unlike
diametral pitch, which is an inverse dimension ("threads per inch"). Thus, if
the pitch diameter of a gear is 40 mm and the number of teeth 20, the module is
2, which means that there are 2 mm of pitch diameter for each tooth.[35] The
preferred standard module values are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0,
1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40 and 50.[36]
***** Manufacture[edit] *****
Main article: Gear_manufacturing
As of 2014, an estimated 80% of all gearing produced worldwide is produced by
net_shape molding. Molded gearing is usually either powder_metallurgy or
plastic.[37] Many gears are done when they leave the mold (including injection
molded plastic and die_cast metal gears), but powdered metal gears require
sintering and sand_castings or investment_castings require gear_cutting or
other machining to finish them. The most common form of gear cutting is
hobbing, but gear_shaping, milling, and broaching also exist. 3D_printing as a
production method is expanding rapidly. For metal gears in the transmissions of
cars and trucks, the teeth are heat_treated to make them hard and more wear
resistant while leaving the core soft and tough. For large gears that are prone
to warp, a quench_press is used.
***** Gear model in modern physics[edit] *****
Modern_physics adopted the gear model in different ways. In the nineteenth
century, James_Clerk_Maxwell developed a model of electromagnetism in which
magnetic field lines were rotating tubes of incompressible fluid. Maxwell used
a gear wheel and called it an "idle wheel" to explain the electric current as a
rotation of particles in opposite directions to that of the rotating field
lines.[38]
More recently, quantum_physics uses "quantum gears" in their model. A group of
gears can serve as a model for several different systems, such as an
artificially constructed nanomechanical device or a group of ring molecules.

The three_wave_hypothesis compares the waveâparticle_duality to a bevel gear.

The gear mechanism was previously considered exclusively artificial, but in
2013, scientists from the University_of_Cambridge announced their discovery
that the juvenile form of a common insect Issus (species Issus_coleoptratus),
found in many European gardens, has a gear-like mechanism in its hind legs.
Each leg has a 400 micrometer strip, pitch radius 200 micrometers, with 12
fully interlocking spur-type gear teeth, including filleted curves at the base
of each tooth to reduce the risk of shearing. The joint rotates like mechanical
gears and synchronizes Issus's legs when it jumps to within 30 microseconds,
preventing yaw rotation.[41][42][43][44]
