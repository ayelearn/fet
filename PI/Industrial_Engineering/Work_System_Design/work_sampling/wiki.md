Work sampling is the statistical technique for determining the proportion of
time spent by workers in various defined categories of activity (e.g. setting
up a machine, assembling two parts, idleâ¦etc.).[1] It is as important as all
other statistical techniques because it permits quick analysis, recognition,
and enhancement of job responsibilities, tasks, performance competencies, and
organizational work flows. Other names used for it are 'activity sampling',
'occurrence sampling', and 'ratio delay study'.[2]
In a work sampling study, a large number of observations are made of the
workers over an extended period of time. For statistical accuracy, the
observations must be taken at random times during the period of study, and the
period must be representative of the types of activities performed by the
subjects.
One important usage of the work sampling technique is the determination of the
standard time for a manual manufacturing task. Similar techniques for
calculating the standard time are time_study, standard data, and predetermined
motion_time_systems.........

***** Characteristics of work sampling study[edit] *****
The study of work sampling has some general characteristics related to the work
condition:
    * One of them is the sufficient time available to perform the study. A work
      sampling study usually requires a substantial period of time to complete.
      There must be enough time available (several weeks or more) to conduct
      the study.
    * Another characteristic is multiple workers. Work sampling is commonly
      used to study the activities of multiple workers rather than one worker.
    * The third characteristic is long cycle time. The job covered in the study
      has relatively a long cycle time.
    * The last condition is the non-repetitive work cycles. The work is not
      highly repetitive. The jobs consist of various tasks rather than a single
      repetitive task. However, it must be possible to classify the work
      activities into a distinct number of categories.
***** Steps in conducting a work sampling study[edit] *****
There are several recommended steps when starting to prepare a work sampling
study:[1]
   1. Define the manufacturing tasks for which the standard time is to be
      determined.
   2. Define the task elements. These are the defined broken-down steps of the
      task that will be observed during the study. Since a worker is going to
      be observed, additional categories will likely be included as well, such
      as "idle", "waiting for work", and "absent".
   3. Design the study. This includes designing the forms that will be used to
      record the observations, determining how many observations will be
      required, deciding on the number of days or shifts to be included in the
      study, scheduling the observations, and finally determining the number of
      observers needed.
   4. Identify the observers who will do the sampling.
   5. Start the study. All those who are affected by the study should be
      informed about it.
   6. Make random visits to the plant and collect the observations.
   7. After completing the study, analyze and present the results. This is done
      by preparing a report that summarizes and analyzes all data and making
      recommendations when required.
***** Determining the number of observations needed in work sampling[edit]
*****
After the work elements are defined, the number of observations for the desired
accuracy at the desired confidence level must be determined. The formula used
in this method is:
    &#x03C3;  P   =     p q  n      {\displaystyle \sigma _{P}={\sqrt {\frac
{pq}{n}}}}  [\sigma _{P}={\sqrt  {{\frac  {pq}{n}}}}]
   n =    p q     &#x03C3;  P     2       {\displaystyle n={\frac {pq}{{\sigma
_{P}}^{2}}}}  [n={\frac  {pq}{{\sigma _{P}}^{2}}}]
    &#x03C3;  P   =   {\displaystyle \sigma _{P}=}  [\sigma _{P}=] standard
error of proportion
   p =   {\displaystyle p=}  [p=] percentage of idle time
   q =   {\displaystyle q=}  [q=] percentage of working time
   n =   {\displaystyle n=}  [n=] number of observations
***** Additional applications of work sampling[edit] *****
Work sampling was initially developed for determining time allocation among
workers' tasks in manufacturing environments.[3] However, the technique has
also been applied more broadly to examine work in a number of different
environments, such as healthcare[4] and construction.[5] More recently, in the
academic fields of organizational_psychology and organizational_behaviour, the
basic technique has been developed into a detailed job_analysis method for
examining a range of different research questions.[6]
