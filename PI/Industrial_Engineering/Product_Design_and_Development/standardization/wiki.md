Implementation of technical standards based on the consensus of different
parties
Standardization or standardisation is the process of implementing and
developing technical_standards based on the consensus of different parties that
include firms, users, interest groups, standards organizations and governments.
[1] Standardization can help maximize compatibility, interoperability, safety,
repeatability, or quality. It can also facilitate commoditization of formerly
custom processes. In social_sciences, including economics,[2] the idea of
standardization is close to the solution for a coordination_problem, a
situation in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making
mutually consistent decisions. This view includes the case of "spontaneous
standardization processes", to produce de_facto_standards.

***** History[edit] *****
**** Early examples[edit] ****
Standard weights and measures were developed by the Indus_Valley_Civilization.
[3] The centralized weight and measure system served the commercial interest of
Indus merchants as smaller weight measures were used to measure luxury goods
while larger weights were employed for buying bulkier items, such as food
grains etc.[4] Weights existed in multiples of a standard weight and in
categories.[4] Technical_standardisation enabled gauging devices to be
effectively used in angular_measurement and measurement for construction.[5]
Uniform units of length were used in the planning of towns such as Lothal,
Surkotada, Kalibangan, Dolavira, Harappa, and Mohenjo-daro.[3] The weights and
measures of the Indus civilization also reached Persia and Central_Asia, where
they were further modified.[6] Shigeo Iwata describes the excavated weights
unearthed from the Indus civilization:
     A total of 558 weights were excavated from Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and
     Chanhu-daro, not including defective weights. They did not find
     statistically significant differences between weights that were
     excavated from five different layers, each measuring about 1.5 m in
     depth. This was evidence that strong control existed for at least a
     500-year period. The 13.7-g weight seems to be one of the units used
     in the Indus valley. The notation was based on the binary and decimal
     systems. 83% of the weights which were excavated from the above three
     cities were cubic, and 68% were made of chert.[3]
**** 18th century attempts[edit] ****
Henry_Maudslay's famous early screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.
The implementation of standards in industry and commerce became highly
important with the onset of the Industrial_Revolution and the need for high-
precision machine_tools and interchangeable_parts.
Henry_Maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting_lathe
in 1800. This allowed for the standardisation of screw_thread sizes for the
first time and paved the way for the practical application of
interchangeability (an idea that was already taking hold) to nuts and bolts.[7]
Before this, screw threads were usually made by chipping and filing (that is,
with skilled freehand use of chisels and files). Nuts were rare; metal screws,
when made at all, were usually for use in wood. Metal bolts passing through
wood framing to a metal fastening on the other side were usually fastened in
non-threaded ways (such as clinching or upsetting against a washer). Maudslay
standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of taps
and_dies that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so
that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This
was a major advance in workshop technology.[8]
**** National standard[edit] ****
Maudslay's work, as well as the contributions of other engineers, accomplished
a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies' in-house standards
spread a bit within their industries.
Graphic representation of formulae for the pitches of threads of screw bolts
Joseph_Whitworth's screw thread measurements were adopted as the first
(unofficial) national standard by companies around the country in 1841. It came
to be known as the British_Standard_Whitworth, and was widely adopted in other
countries.[9][10]
This new standard specified a 55Â° thread angle and a thread depth of 0.640327p
and a radius of 0.137329p, where p is the pitch. The thread pitch increased
with diameter in steps specified on a chart. An example of the use of the
Whitworth thread is the Royal_Navy's Crimean_War gunboats. These were the first
instance of "mass-production" techniques being applied to marine engineering.
[7]
With the adoption of BSW by British railway lines, many of which had previously
used their own standard both for threads and for bolt head and nut profiles,
and improving manufacturing techniques, it came to dominate British
manufacturing.
American_Unified_Coarse was originally based on almost the same imperial
fractions. The Unified thread angle is 60Â° and has flattened crests (Whitworth
crests are rounded). Thread pitch is the same in both systems except that the
thread pitch for the &#x200b;1⁄2 in bolt is 12 threads per inch (tpi) in BSW
versus 13 tpi in the UNC.
**** National standards body[edit] ****
By the end of the 19th century, differences in standards between companies, was
making trade increasingly difficult and strained. For instance, an iron and
steel dealer recorded his displeasure in The_Times: "Architects and engineers
generally specify such unnecessarily diverse types of sectional material or
given work that anything like economical and continuous manufacture becomes
impossible. In this country no two professional men are agreed upon the size
and weight of a girder to employ for given work."
The Engineering_Standards_Committee was established in London in 1901 as the
world's first national standards body.[11][12] It subsequently extended its
standardization work and became the British Engineering Standards Association
in 1918, adopting the name British Standards Institution in 1931 after
receiving its Royal Charter in 1929. The national standards were adopted
universally throughout the country, and enabled the markets to act more
rationally and efficiently, with an increased level of cooperation.
After the First_World_War, similar national bodies were established in other
countries. The Deutsches_Institut_fÃ¼r_Normung was set up in Germany in 1917,
followed by its counterparts, the American National_Standard_Institute and the
French Commission_Permanente_de_Standardisation, both in 1918.[7]
**** International standards[edit] ****
The first modern International_Organization (Intergovernmental_Organization)
the International Telegraph Union (now International_Telecommunication_Union)
was created in 1865[13] to set international standards in order to connect
national telegraph networks, as a merger of two predescessor organizations
(Bern and Paris treaties) that had similar objectives, but in more limited
territories.[14][15] With the advent of radiocommunication soon after the
creation, the work of the ITU quickly expanded from the standardization of
Telegraph communications, to developing standards for telecommunications in
general.
Parallely, by the mid to late 19th century, efforts were being made to
standardize electrical measurement. Lord_Kelvin was an important figure in this
process, introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity.
In 1857, he introduced a series of effective instruments, including the
quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic
measurement. He invented the current_balance, also known as the Kelvin balance
or Ampere balance (SiC), for the precise specification of the ampere, the
standard unit of electric_current.[16]
R._E._B._Crompton drew up the International_Electrotechnical_Commission, in
1906.
Another important figure was R._E._B._Crompton, who became concerned by the
large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering
companies and scientists in the early 20th century. Many companies had entered
the market in the 1890s and all chose their own settings for voltage,
frequency, current and even the symbols used on circuit diagrams. Adjacent
buildings would have totally incompatible electrical systems simply because
they had been fitted out by different companies. Crompton could see the lack of
efficiency in this system and began to consider proposals for an international
standard for electric engineering.[17]
In 1904, Crompton represented Britain at the International_Electrical_Congress,
held in connection with Louisiana_Purchase_Exposition in Saint_Louis as part of
a delegation by the Institute_of_Electrical_Engineers. He presented a paper on
standardisation, which was so well received that he was asked to look into the
formation of a commission to oversee the process.[18] By 1906 his work was
complete and he drew up a permanent constitution for the International
Electrotechnical_Commission.[19] The body held its first meeting that year in
London, with representatives from 14 countries. In honour of his contribution
to electrical standardisation, Lord Kelvin was elected as the body's first
President.[20]
Memorial plaque of founding ISA in Prague.
The International_Federation_of_the_National_Standardizing_Associations (ISA)
was founded in 1926 with a broader remit to enhance international cooperation
for all technical standards and specifications. The body was suspended in 1942
during World_War II.
After the war, ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations
Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global
standards body. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met
in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International
Organization_for_Standardization (ISO); the new organization officially began
operations in February 1947.[21]
In general, each country or economy has a single recognized National Standards
Body (NSB). Examples include ABNT, AENOR, AFNOR, ANSI, BSI, DGN, DIN, IRAM,
JISC, KATS, SABS, SAC, SCC, SIS. An NSB is likely the sole member from that
economy in ISO.
NSBs may be either public or private sector organizations, or combinations of
the two. For example, the three NSBs of Canada, Mexico and the United States
are respectively the Standards Council of Canada (SCC), the General Bureau of
Standards (DirecciÃ³n General de Normas, DGN), and the American_National
Standards_Institute (ANSI). SCC is a Canadian Crown_Corporation, DGN is a
governmental agency within the Mexican Ministry of Economy, and ANSI and AENOR
are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with members from both the private and
public sectors. The determinants of whether an NSB for a particular economy is
a public or private sector body may include the historical and traditional
roles that the private sector fills in public affairs in that economy or the
development stage of that economy.
***** Usage[edit] *****
Standards can be:
    * de_facto_standards which means they are followed by informal convention
      or dominant usage.
    * de_jure standards which are part of legally binding contracts, laws or
      regulations.
    * Voluntary standards which are published and available for people to
      consider for use.
The existence of a published standard does not necessarily imply that it is
useful or correct. Just because an item is stamped with a standard number does
not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for any particular use. The
people who use the item or service (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify
it (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to
consider the available standards, specify the correct one, enforce compliance,
and use the item correctly: validation_and_verification.
Standardization is implemented greatly when companies release new products to
market. Compatibility is important for products to be successful; this allows
consumers to use their new items along with what they already own.
**** Clinical assessment[edit] ****
In the context of assessment, standardization may define how a measuring
instrument or procedure is similar to every subjects or patients.[22]:399[23]:
71 For example, educational psychologist may adopt structured_interview to
systematically interview the people in concern. By delivering the same
procedures, all subjects is evaluated using same criteria and minimising any
confounding_variable that reduce the validity. [23]:72 Some other example
includes mental_status_examination and personality_test.
**** Social science[edit] ****
In the context of social criticism and social_science, standardization often
means the process of establishing standards of various kinds and improving
efficiency to handle people, their interactions, cases, and so forth. Examples
include formalization of judicial procedure in court, and establishing uniform
criteria for diagnosing mental disease. Standardization in this sense is often
discussed along with (or synonymously to) such large-scale social changes as
modernization, bureaucratization, homogenization, and centralization of
society.
**** Information exchange[edit] ****
In the context of information exchange, standardization refers to the process
of developing standards for specific business processes using specific formal
languages. These standards are usually developed in voluntary consensus
standards bodies such as the United Nations Center for Trade Facilitation and
Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), the World Wide Web Consortium W3C, the
Telecommunications_Industry_Association (TIA), and the Organization for the
Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).
There are many specifications that govern the operation and interaction of
devices and software on the Internet, but they are rarely referred to as
standards, so as to preserve that word as the domain of relatively
disinterested bodies such as ISO. The W3C, for example, publishes
"Recommendations", and the IETF publishes "Requests_for_Comments" (RFCs).
However, these publications are sometimes referred to as standards.
**** Customer service[edit] ****
In the context of customer_service, standardization refers to the process of
developing an international standard that enables organizations to focus on
customer service, while at the same time providing recognition of success
[clarification_needed] through a third party organization, such as the British
Standards_Institution. An international standard has been developed by The
International_Customer_Service_Institute.
**** Supply and materials management[edit] ****
In the context of supply_chain_management and materials_management,
standardization covers the process of specification and use of any item the
company must buy in or make, allowable substitutions, and build_or_buy
decisions.
**** Defense[edit] ****
In the context of defense, standardization has been defined by NATO as The
development and implementation of concepts, doctrines, procedures and designs
to achieve and maintain the required levels of compatibility,
interchangeability or commonality in the operational, procedural, material,
technical and administrative fields to attain interoperability.[24]

The process of standardization can itself be standardized. There are at least
four levels of standardization: compatibility, interchangeability, commonality
and reference. These standardization processes create compatibility,
similarity, measurement and symbol standards.
There are typically four different techniques for standardization
    * Simplification or variety control
    * Codification
    * Value_engineering
    * Statistical_process_control.
Types of standardization process:
    * Emergence as de_facto_standard: tradition, market domination, etc.
    * Written by a Standards_organization:
          o in a closed consensus process: Restricted membership and often
            having formal procedures for due-process among voting members
          o in a full consensus process: usually open to all interested and
            qualified parties and with formal procedures for due-process
            considerations[25]
    * Written by a government or regulatory body
    * Written by a corporation, union, trade association, etc.
***** Effects[edit] *****
Standardization/ Standardisation has a variety of benefits and drawbacks for
firms and consumers participating in the market, and on technology and
innovation.
**** Effect on firms[edit] ****
The primary effect of standardization on firms is that the basis of competition
is shifted from integrated systems to individual components within the system.
Prior to standardization a company's product must span the entire system
because individual components from different competitors are incompatible, but
after standardization each company can focus on providing an individual
component of the system.[26] When the shift toward competition based on
individual components takes place, firms selling tightly integrated systems
must quickly shift to a modular approach, supplying other companies with
subsystems or components.[27]
**** Effect on consumers[edit] ****
Standardization has a variety of benefits for consumers, but one of the
greatest benefits is enhanced network effects. Standards increase compatibility
and interoperability between products, allowing information to be shared within
a larger network and attracting more consumers to use the new technology,
further enhancing network effects.[28] Other benefits of standardization to
consumers are reduced uncertainty, because consumers can be more certain that
they are not choosing the wrong product, and reduced lock-in, because the
standard makes it more likely that there will be competing products in the
space.[29] Consumers may also get the benefit of being able to mix and match
components of a system to align with their specific preferences.[30] Once these
initial benefits of standardization are realized, further benefits that accrue
to consumers as a result of using the standard are driven mostly by the quality
of the technologies underlying that standard.[31]
Probably the greatest downside of standardization for consumers is lack of
variety. There is no guarantee that the chosen standard will meet all
consumers' needs or even that the standard is the best available option.[30]
Another downside is that if a standard is agreed upon before products are
available in the market, then consumers are deprived of the penetration pricing
that often results when rivals are competing to rapidly increase market share
in an attempt to increase the likelihood that their product will become the
standard.[30] It is also possible that a consumer will choose a product based
upon a standard that fails to become dominant.[32] In this case, the consumer
will have spent resources on a product that is ultimately less useful to him or
her as the result of the standardization process.
**** Effect on technology[edit] ****
Much like the effect on consumers, the effect of standardization on technology
and innovation is mixed.[33] Meanwhile, the various links between research and
standardization have been identified,[34] also as a platform of knowledge
transfer[35] and translated into policy measures (e.g. WIPANO).
Increased adoption of a new technology as a result of standardization is
important because rival and incompatible approaches competing in the
marketplace can slow or even kill the growth of the technology (a state known
as market_fragmentation).[36] The shift to a modularized architecture as a
result of standardization brings increased flexibility, rapid introduction of
new products, and the ability to more closely meet individual customer's needs.
[37]
The negative effects of standardization on technology have to do with its
tendency to restrict new technology and innovation. Standards shift competition
from features to price because the features are defined by the standard. The
degree to which this is true depends on the specificity of the standard.[38]
Standardization in an area also rules out alternative technologies as options
while encouraging others.[39]
