****** Acceptance sampling ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Acceptance sampling uses statistical_sampling to determine whether to accept or
reject a production lot of material. It has been a common quality_control
technique used in industry. It is usually done as products leaves the factory,
or in some cases even within the factory. Most often a producer supplies a
consumer a number of items and a decision to accept or reject the items is made
by determining the number of defective items in a sample from the lot. The lot
is accepted if the number of defects falls below where the acceptance number or
otherwise the lot is rejected.[1]
In general, acceptance sampling is employed when one or several of the
following hold:[2]
    * testing is destructive;
    * the cost of 100% inspection is very high; and
    * 100% inspection takes too long.
A wide variety of acceptance sampling_plans are available. For example,
multiple sampling plans use more than two samples to reach a conclusion. A
shorter examination period and smaller sample sizes are features of this type
of plan. Although the samples are taken at random, the sampling procedure is
still reliable.[3]

***** History[edit] *****
Acceptance sampling procedures became common during World War II. Sampling
plans, such as MIL-STD-105, were developed by Harold_F._Dodge and others and
became frequently used as standards.
More recently, quality_assurance broadened the scope beyond final inspection to
include all aspects of manufacturing. Broader quality_management_systems
include methodologies such as statistical_process_control, HACCP, six_sigma,
and ISO_9000. Some use of acceptance sampling still remains.
***** Rationale[edit] *****
Sampling provides one rational means of verification that a production lot
conforms with the requirements of technical_specifications. 100% inspection
does not guarantee 100% compliance and is too time consuming and costly. Rather
than evaluating all items, a specified sample is taken, inspected or tested,
and a decision is made about accepting or rejecting the entire production lot.
Plans have known risks: an acceptable_quality_limit (AQL) and a rejectable
quality level, such as lot tolerance percent defective (LTDP), are part of the
operating_characteristic_curve of the sampling plan. These are primarily
statistical risks and do not necessarily imply that defective product is
intentionally being made or accepted. Plans can have a known average outgoing
quality limit (AOQL).
***** Acceptance sampling for attributes[edit] *****
A single sampling plan for attributes is a statistical method by which the lot
is accepted or rejected on the basis of one sample.[4] Suppose that we have a
lot of size     M   {\displaystyle M}  [M]; a random sample of size     N < M
{\displaystyle N<M}  [{\displaystyle N<M}] is selected from the lot; and an
acceptance number     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B] is determined. If it is found
the number of nonconforming is less than or equal to     B   {\displaystyle B}
[B], the lot is accepted; and if the number of nonconforming is greater than
B   {\displaystyle B}  [B], the lot is not accepted. The design of a single
sampling plan requires the selection of the sample size     N   {\displaystyle
N}  [N] and the acceptance number     B   {\displaystyle B}  [B].
MIL-STD-105 was a United States defense standard that provided procedures and
tables for sampling by attributes (pass or fail characteristic). MIL-STD-105E
was cancelled in 1995 but is available in related documents such as ANSI/ASQ
Z1.4, "Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by Attributes". Several
levels of inspection are provided and can be indexed to several AQLs. The
sample_size is specified and the basis for acceptance or rejection (number of
defects) is provided.
***** Variables sampling plan[edit] *****
Main article: Variables_sampling_plan
When a measured characteristic produces a number, other sampling plans, such as
those based on MIL-STD-414, are often used. Compared with attribute sampling
plans, these often use a smaller sample_size for the same indexed AQL.
