Historical financial statements
Financial statements (or financial reports) are formal records of the financial
activities and position of a business, person, or other entity.
Relevant financial information is presented in a structured manner and in a
form which is easy to understand. They typically include four basic financial
statements accompanied by a management_discussion_and_analysis:[2]
   1. A balance_sheet or statement of financial position, reports on a
      company's assets, liabilities, and owners_equity at a given point in
      time.
   2. An income_statementâor profit and loss report (P&L report), or
      statement of comprehensive income, or statement of revenue &
      expenseâreports on a company's income, expenses, and profits over a
      stated period of time. A profit and loss statement provides information
      on the operation of the enterprise. These include sales and the various
      expenses incurred during the stated period.
   3. A statement_of_changes_in_equity or equity statement, or statement of
      retained earnings, reports on the changes in equity of the company over a
      stated period of time.
   4. A cash_flow_statement reports on a company's cash_flow activities,
      particularly its operating, investing and financing activities over a
      stated period of time.
(Notably, a balance sheet represents a single point in time, where the income
statement, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement each
represent activities over a stated period of time.)
For large corporations, these statements may be complex and may include an
extensive set of footnotes to the financial statements and management
discussion and analysis. The notes typically describe each item on the balance
sheet, income statement and cash flow statement in further detail. Notes to
financial statements are considered an integral part of the financial
statements.

***** Purpose for business entities[edit] *****
"The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the
financial position, performance and changes in financial position of an
enterprise that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic
decisions."[3] Financial statements should be understandable, relevant,
reliable and comparable. Reported assets, liabilities, equity, income and
expenses are directly related to an organization's financial position.
Financial statements are intended to be understandable by readers who have "a
reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting and who
are willing to study the information diligently."[3] Financial statements may
be used by users for different purposes:
    * Owners and managers require financial statements to make important
      business decisions that affect its continued operations. Financial
      analysis is then performed on these statements to provide management with
      a more detailed understanding of the figures. These statements are also
      used as part of management's annual report to the stockholders.
    * Employees also need these reports in making collective_bargaining
      agreements (CBA) with the management, in the case of labor_unions or for
      individuals in discussing their compensation, promotion and rankings.
    * Prospective investors make use of financial statements to assess the
      viability of investing in a business. Financial analyses are often used
      by investors and are prepared by professionals (financial analysts), thus
      providing them with the basis for making investment decisions.
    * Financial institutions (banks and other lending companies) use them to
      decide whether to grant a company with fresh working_capital or extend
      debt securities (such as a long-term bank_loan or debentures) to finance
      expansion and other significant expenditures.
***** Consolidated[edit] *****
Main article: Consolidated_financial_statement
Consolidated financial statements are defined as "Financial_statements of a
group in which the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash_flows
of the parent (company) and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single
economic_entity", according to International_Accounting_Standard 27
"Consolidated and separate financial statements", and International_Financial
Reporting_Standard 10 "Consolidated financial statements".[4][5]
***** Government[edit] *****
See also: Fund_accounting
The rules for the recording, measurement and presentation of government
financial_statements may be different from those required for business and even
for non-profit organizations. They may use either of two accounting_methods:
accrual accounting, or cost accounting, or a combination of the two (OCBOA). A
complete set of chart_of_accounts is also used that is substantially different
from the chart of a profit-oriented business.
***** Personal[edit] *****
Personal financial statements may be required from persons applying for a
personal_loan or financial_aid. Typically, a personal financial statement
consists of a single form for reporting personally held assets and liabilities
(debts), or personal sources of income and expenses, or both. The form to be
filled out is determined by the organization supplying the loan or aid.
***** Audit and legal implications[edit] *****
Although laws differ from country to country, an audit of the financial
statements of a public_company is usually required for investment, financing,
and tax purposes. These are usually performed by independent accountants or
auditing firms. Results of the audit are summarized in an audit_report that
either provide an unqualified opinion on the financial statements or
qualifications as to its fairness and accuracy. The audit opinion on the
financial statements is usually included in the annual report.
There has been much legal debate over who an auditor is liable to. Since audit
reports tend to be addressed to the current shareholders, it is commonly
thought that they owe a legal duty of care to them. But this may not be the
case as determined by common law precedent. In Canada, auditors are liable only
to investors using a prospectus to buy shares in the primary market. In the
United_Kingdom, they have been held liable to potential investors when the
auditor was aware of the potential investor and how they would use the
information in the financial statements. Nowadays auditors tend to include in
their report liability restricting language, discouraging anyone other than the
addressees of their report from relying on it. Liability is an important issue:
in the UK, for example, auditors have unlimited_liability.
In the United_States, especially in the post-Enron era there has been
substantial concern about the accuracy of financial statements. Corporate
officersâthe chief_executive_officer (CEO) and chief_financial_officer
(CFO)âare personally responsible for fair financial reporting that provides
an accurate sense of the organization to those reading the report.
***** Standards and regulations[edit] *****
Different countries have developed their own accounting principles over time,
making international comparisons of companies difficult. To ensure uniformity
and comparability between financial statements prepared by different companies,
a set of guidelines and rules are used. Commonly referred to as Generally
Accepted_Accounting_Principles (GAAP), these set of guidelines provide the
basis in the preparation of financial statements, although many companies
voluntarily_disclose information beyond the scope of such requirements.[6]
Recently there has been a push towards standardizing accounting rules made by
the International_Accounting_Standards_Board ("IASB"). IASB develops
International_Financial_Reporting_Standards that have been adopted by
Australia, Canada and the European_Union (for publicly quoted companies only),
are under consideration in South_Africa and other_countries. The United_States
Financial_Accounting_Standards_Board has made a commitment to converge the U.S.
GAAP and IFRS over time.
***** Inclusion in annual reports[edit] *****
To entice new investors, public companies assemble their financial statements
on fine paper with pleasing graphics and photos in an annual_report_to
shareholders, attempting to capture the excitement and culture of the
organization in a "marketing brochure" of sorts. Usually the company's chief
executive will write a letter to shareholders, describing management's
performance and the company's financial highlights.
In the United States, prior to the advent of the internet, the annual report
was considered the most effective way for corporations to communicate with
individual shareholders. Blue_chip companies went to great expense to produce
and mail out attractive annual reports to every shareholder. The annual report
was often prepared in the style of a coffee_table_book.
***** Notes[edit] *****
Additional information added to the end of financial statements that help
explain specific items in the statements as well as provide a more
comprehensive assessment of a company's financial condition are known as notes
(or "notes to financial statements").
Notes to financial statements can include information on debt, accounts,
contingent_liabilities, on going_concern criteria, or on contextual information
explaining the financial numbers (e.g. to indicate a lawsuit). The notes
clarify individual statement line-items. Notes are also used to explain the
accounting methods used to prepare the statements and they support valuations
for how particular accounts have been computed. As an example: If a company
lists a loss on a fixed_asset impairment line in their income statement, the
notes may state the reason for the impairment by describing how the asset
became impaired.
In consolidated_financial_statements, all subsidiaries are listed as well as
the amount of ownership (controlling_interest) that the parent_company has in
the subsidiaries. Any items within the financial statements that are valuated
by estimation are part of the notes if a substantial difference exists between
the amount of the estimate previously reported and the actual result. Full
disclosure of the effects of the differences between the estimate and actual
results should be included.
***** Management discussion and analysis[edit] *****
Management discussion and analysis or MD&A is an integrated part of a company's
annual financial statements. The purpose of the MD&A is to provide a narrative
explanation, through the eyes of management, of how an entity has performed in
the past, its financial condition, and its future prospects. In so doing, the
MD&A attempt to provide investors with complete, fair, and balanced information
to help them decide whether to invest or continue to invest in an entity.[7]
The section contains a description of the year gone by and some of the key
factors that influenced the business of the company in that year, as well as a
fair and unbiased overview of the company's past, present, and future.
MD&A typically describes the corporation's liquidity_position, capital
resources,[8] results of its operations, underlying causes of material changes
in financial statement items (such as asset impairment and restructuring
charges), events of unusual or infrequent nature (such as mergers_and
acquisitions or share_buybacks), positive and negative trends, effects of
inflation, domestic and international market risks,[9] and significant
uncertainties.
***** Move to electronic statements[edit] *****
Financial statements have been created on paper for hundreds of years. The
growth of the Web has seen more and more financial statements created in an
electronic form which is exchangeable over the Web. Common forms of electronic
financial statements are PDF and HTML. These types of electronic financial
statements have their drawbacks in that it still takes a human to read the
information in order to reuse the information contained in a financial
statement.
More recently a market driven global standard, XBRL (Extensible Business
Reporting Language), which can be used for creating financial statements in a
structured and computer readable format, has become more popular as a format
for creating financial statements. Many regulators around the world such as the
U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission have mandated XBRL for the submission
of financial information.
The UN/CEFACT created, with respect to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, (GAAP), internal or external financial_reporting XML messages to be
used between enterprises and their partners, such as private interested parties
(e.g. bank) and public collecting bodies (e.g. taxation authorities). Many
regulators use such messages to collect financial and economic information.
