Explosion welding (EXW) is a solid_state_(solid-phase) process where welding is
accomplished by accelerating one of the components at extremely high velocity
through the use of chemical explosives. This process is most commonly utilized
to clad carbon_steel plate with a thin layer of corrosion resistant material
(e.g., stainless_steel, nickel alloy, titanium, or zirconium). Due to the
nature of this process, producible geometries are very limited. Typical
geometries produced include plates, tubing and tube sheets.[1]

***** Development[edit] *****
Unlike other forms of welding such as arc_welding (which was developed in the
late 19th century), explosion welding was developed relatively recently, in the
decades after World_War_II. Its origins, however, go back to World_War_I, when
it was observed that pieces of shrapnel sticking to armor plating were not only
embedding themselves, but were actually being welded to the metal. Since the
extreme heat involved in other forms of welding did not play a role, it was
concluded that the phenomenon was caused by the explosive forces acting on the
shrapnel. These results were later duplicated in laboratory tests and, not long
afterwards, the process was patented and put to use.
In 1962, DuPont applied for a patent on the explosion welding process, which
was granted on June 23, 1964 under US Patent 3,137,937[2] and resulted in the
use of the Detaclad trademark to describe the process. On July 22, 1996,
Dynamic_Materials_Corporation completed the acquisition of DuPont's Detaclad
operations for a purchase price of $5,321,850 (or about $8.5 million today).
The response of inhomogeneous plates undergoing explosive welding was
analytically modeled in 2011.[3]
***** Advantages and disadvantages[edit] *****
Explosion welding can produce a bond between two metals that cannot necessarily
be welded by conventional means. The process does not melt either metal,
instead plasticizing the surfaces of both metals, causing them to come into
intimate contact sufficient to create a weld. This is a similar principle to
other non-fusion welding techniques, such as friction_welding. Large areas can
be bonded extremely quickly and the weld itself is very clean, due to the fact
that the surface material of both metals is violently expelled during the
reaction.
Explosion welding can join a wide array of compatible and non-compatible
metals; with more than 260 metal combinations possible.[4]
A disadvantage of this method is that extensive knowledge of explosives is
needed before the procedure may be attempted safely. Regulations for the use of
high explosives may require special licensing.[5]
