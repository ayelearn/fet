Manufacturing process
This article is about the manufacturing process. For other uses, see Casting_
(disambiguation).
For molding plastics, see Molding_(process).

Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured
into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then
allowed to solidify. The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is
ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. Casting materials
are usually metals or various time setting materials that cure after mixing two
or more components together; examples are epoxy, concrete, plaster and clay.
Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise
difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.Heavy equipment like machine
tool beds,ship's propeller etc. can be cast easily in the required size rather
than fabricating them by joining several small pieces.[1]
Casting is a 7000-year-old process. The oldest surviving casting is a copper
frog from 3200 BC.[2]

***** History[edit] *****
The oldest known example of the lost_wax technique is a 6,000-year old amulet
from Indus valley civilization.[3]
***** Types[edit] *****
**** Metal[edit] ****
Main article: Casting_(metalworking)
In metalworking, metal is heated until it becomes liquid and is then poured
into a mold. The mold is a hollow cavity that includes the desired shape, but
the mold also includes runners and risers that enable the metal to fill the
mold. The mold and the metal are then cooled until the metal solidifies. The
solidified part (the casting) is then recovered from the mold. Subsequent
operations remove excess material caused by the casting process (such as the
runners and risers).
**** Plaster, concrete, or plastic resin[edit] ****
Main article: Resin_casting
Plaster and other chemical curing materials such as concrete and plastic resin
may be cast using single-use waste molds as noted above, multiple-use 'piece'
molds, or molds made of small rigid pieces or of flexible material such as
latex rubber (which is in turn supported by an exterior mold). When casting
plaster or concrete, the material surface is flat and lacks transparency. Often
topical treatments are applied to the surface. For example, painting and
etching can be used in a way that give the appearance of metal or stone.
Alternatively, the material is altered in its initial casting process and may
contain colored sand so as to give an appearance of stone. By casting concrete,
rather than plaster, it is possible to create sculptures, fountains, or seating
for outdoor use. A simulation of high-quality marble may be made using certain
chemically-set plastic resins (for example epoxy or polyester which are
thermosetting_polymers) with powdered stone added for coloration, often with
multiple colors worked in. The latter is a common means of making washstands,
washstand tops and shower stalls, with the skilled working of multiple colors
resulting in simulated staining patterns as is often found in natural marble or
travertine.
***** Fettling[edit] *****
Raw castings often contain irregularities caused by seams and imperfections in
the molds,[4] as well as access ports for pouring material into the molds.[5]
The process of cutting, grinding, shaving or sanding away these unwanted bits
is called "fettling".[6][7] In modern times robotic processes have been
developed to perform some of the more repetitive parts of the fettling process,
[8] but historically fettlers carried out this arduous work manually,[9] and
often in conditions dangerous to their health.[10]
Fettling can add significantly to the cost of the resulting product, and
designers of molds seek to minimize it through the shape of the mold, the
material being cast, and sometimes by including decorative elements.[11][4]
***** Casting process simulation[edit] *****
Casting process simulation uses numerical methods to calculate cast component
quality considering mold filling, solidification and cooling, and provides a
quantitative prediction of casting mechanical properties, thermal stresses and
distortion. Simulation accurately describes a cast component's quality up-front
before production starts. The casting rigging can be designed with respect to
the required component properties. This has benefits beyond a reduction in pre-
production sampling, as the precise layout of the complete casting system also
leads to energy, material, and tooling savings.
The software supports the user in component design, the determination of
melting practice and casting methoding through to pattern and mold making, heat
treatment, and finishing. This saves costs along the entire casting
manufacturing route.
Casting process simulation was initially developed at universities starting
from the early '70s, mainly in Europe and in the U.S., and is regarded as the
most important innovation in casting technology over the last 50 years. Since
the late '80s, commercial programs (such as AutoCAST and MAGMA) are available
which make it possible for foundries to gain new insight into what is happening
inside the mold or die during the casting process.
