From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
The term machinability refers to the ease with which a metal can be cut
(machined) permitting the removal of the material with a satisfactory finish at
low cost.[1] Materials with good machinability require little power to cut, can
be cut quickly, easily obtain a good finish, and do not wear the tooling much;
such materials are said to be free machining. The factors that typically
improve a material's performance often degrade its machinability. Therefore, to
manufacture components economically, engineers are challenged to find ways to
improve machinability without harming performance.
Machinability can be difficult to predict because machining has so many
variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the
physical properties of work materials.[2] The condition of the work material
includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical
composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength.[3]
Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the
modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work
hardening.[3] Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool
material and geometry, and the machining process parameters.[3]

***** Quantifying machinability[edit] *****
There are many factors affecting machinability, but no widely accepted way to
quantify it. Instead, machinability is often assessed on a case-by-case basis,
and tests are tailored to the needs of a specific manufacturing process. Common
metrics for comparison include tool life, surface finish, cutting temperature,
and tool forces and power consumption.[4][5]
**** Tool life method[edit] ****
Machinability can be based on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be
useful when comparing materials that have similar properties and power
consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The
major downfall with this approach is that tool life is dependent on more than
just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material,
cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed,
feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be
compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).[5]
    Machineability index (  &#x0025;  )  =   cutting speed of material for 20
minute tool life cutting speed of free-cutting steel for 20 minute tool life
&#x2217; 100   {\displaystyle {\text{Machineability index (}}\%{)}={\frac
{\text{cutting speed of material for 20 minute tool life}}{\text{cutting speed
of free-cutting steel for 20 minute tool life}}}*100}  [{\displaystyle {\text
{Machineability index (}}\%{)}={\frac {\text{cutting speed of material for 20
minute tool life}}{\text{cutting speed of free-cutting steel for 20 minute tool
life}}}*100}]
**** Tool forces and power consumption method[edit] ****
The forces required for a tool to cut through a material is directly related to
the power consumed. Therefore, tool forces are often given in units of specific
energy. This leads to a rating method where higher specific energies equal
lower machinability. The advantage of this method is that outside factors have
little effect on the rating.[5]
**** Surface finish method[edit] ****
The surface finish is sometimes used to measure the machinability of a
material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built_up_edge. Stainless steel
and other materials with a high strain_hardening ability also want to form a
built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and free_machining_steels,
as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges,
so these materials would rank as more machinable.[6]
The advantage of this method is that it is easily measured with the appropriate
equipment. The disadvantage of this criterion is that it is often irrelevant.
For instance when making a rough cut, the surface finish is of no importance.
Also, finish cuts often require a certain accuracy that naturally achieves a
good surface finish. This rating method also doesn't always agree with other
methods. For instance titanium alloys would rate well by the surface finish
method, low by the tool life method, and intermediate by the power consumption
method.[6][7]
**** Machinability rating[edit] ****
The machinability rating of a material attempts to quantify the machinability
of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a normalized_value.
The American_Iron_and_Steel_Institute (AISI) determined machinability ratings
for a wide variety of materials by running turning tests at 180 surface_feet
per_minute (sfpm).[8] It then arbitrarily assigned 160 Brinell B1112 steel a
machinability rating of 100%.[8] The machinability rating is determined by
measuring the weighed averages of the normal cutting speed, surface finish, and
tool life for each material.[8] Note that a material with a machinability
rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and
material with a value more than 100% would be easier.
Machinability Rating= (Speed of Machining the workpiece giving 60min tool
life)/( Speed of machining the standard metal)
Machinability ratings can be used in conjunction with the Taylor tool life
equation,     V  T  n   = C   {\displaystyle VT^{n}=C}  [VT^n = C], in order to
determine cutting speeds or tool life. It is known that B1112 has a tool life
of 60 minutes at a cutting speed of 100 sfpm. If a material has a machinability
rating of 70%, it can be determined, with the above knowns, that in order to
maintain the same tool life (60 minutes) the cutting speed must be 70 sfpm
(assuming the same tooling is used).[1]
***** Steels[edit] *****
See also: Free_machining_steel
The carbon content of steel greatly affects its machinability. High-carbon
steels are difficult to machine because they are strong and because they may
contain carbides that abrade the cutting tool. On the other end of the
spectrum, low-carbon steels are troublesome because they are too soft. Low-
carbon steels are "gummy" and stick to the cutting tool, resulting in a built
up edge that shortens tool life. Therefore, steel has the best machinability
with medium amounts of carbon, about 0.20%.[4]
Chromium, molybdenum and other alloying metals are often added to steel to
improve its strength. However, most of these metals also decrease
machinability.
Inclusions in steel, especially oxides, may abrade the cutting tool. Machinable
steel should be free of these oxides.
**** Additives[edit] ****
There are a variety of chemicals, both metal and non-metal, that can be added
to steel to make it easier to cut. These additives may work by lubricating the
tool-chip interface, decreasing the shear strength of the material, or
increasing the brittleness of the chip. Historically, sulphur and lead have
been the most common additives, but bismuth and tin are increasingly popular
for environmental reasons.
Lead can improve the machinability of steel because it acts as an internal
lubricant in the cutting zone.[9] Since lead has poor shear strength, it allows
the chip to slide more freely past the cutting edge. When it is added in small
quantities to steel, it can greatly improve its machinability while not
significantly affecting the steel's strength.
Sulphur improves the machinability of steel by forming low shear strength
inclusions in the cutting zone. These inclusions are stress risers that weaken
the steel, allowing it to deform more easily.
**** Stainless steel[edit] ****
Stainless steels have poor machinability compared to regular carbon steel
because they are tougher, gummier and tend to work harden very rapidly.[4]
Slightly hardening the steel may decrease its gumminess and make it easier to
cut. AISI grades 303 and 416 are easier to machine because of the addition of
sulphur and phosphorus.[10]
***** Aluminium[edit] *****
Aluminium is a much softer metal than steel, and the techniques to improve its
machinability usually rely on making it more brittle. Alloys 2007, 2011 and
6020 have very good machinability.[10]
***** Other materials[edit] *****
Thermoplastics are difficult to machine because they have poor thermal
conductivity.[9] This creates heat that builds up in the cutting zone, which
degrades the tool life and locally melts the plastic. Once the plastic melts,
it just flows around the cutting edge instead of being removed by it.
Machinability can be improved by using high lubricity coolant and keeping the
cutting area free of chip build up.
Composites often have the worst machinability because they combine the poor
thermal conductivity of a plastic resin with the tough or abrasive qualities of
the fiber (glass, carbon etc.) material.
The machinability of rubber and other soft materials improves by using a very
low temperature coolant, such as liquid carbon dioxide. The low temperatures
chill the material prior to cutting so that it cannot deform or stick to the
cutting edge. This means less wear on the tools and easier machining.
