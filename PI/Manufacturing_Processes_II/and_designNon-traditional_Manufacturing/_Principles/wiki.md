****** Principle ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Rule that has to be followed or is an inevitable consequence of something, such
as the laws observed in nature
Not to be confused with Principal. For other uses, see Principle_
(disambiguation).
The concept_of_blind_justice is a moral principle.[1]
A principle is a proposition or value that is a guide for behavior or
evaluation. In law, it is a rule that has to be or usually is to be followed,
or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something,
such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed.
The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential
characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the
effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the
principles was to be ignored.[2] A system may be explicitly based on and
implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's 360/370
Principles of Operation.
Examples of principles are, entropy in a number of fields, least_action in
physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: doctrines or
assumptions forming normative rules of conduct, separation_of_church_and_state
in statecraft, the central_dogma_of_molecular_biology, fairness in ethics, etc.
In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule
governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a
character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged
from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in
principle" but not in fact.

***** As law[edit] *****
**** As moral law[edit] ****
Socrates preferred to face execution rather than betray his moral principles.
[3]
Main article: Ethics
A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a
particular society. To "act on principle" is to act in accordance with one's
moral ideals.[4] Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of
socialization. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is
restrained. Exemplary principles include First,_do_no_harm, the golden_rule and
the doctrine_of_the_mean.
**** As a juridic law[edit] ****
Main article: Principle_of_legality
It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the
life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the
State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore
acts as principle conditioning of the action that limits the liberty of the
individuals. See, for examples, the territorial_principle, homestead_principle,
and precautionary_principle.
**** As scientific law[edit] ****
Archimedes_principle, relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an
early example of a law in science. Another early one developed by Malthus is
the population principle, now called the Malthusian_principle.[5] Freud also
wrote on principles, especially the reality_principle necessary to keep the id
and pleasure_principle in check. Biologists use the principle_of_priority and
principle_of_Binominal_nomenclature for precision in naming species. There are
many principles observed in physics, notably in cosmology which observes the
mediocrity_principle, the anthropic_principle, the principle_of_relativity and
the cosmological_principle. Other well-known principles include the uncertainty
principle in quantum_mechanics and the pigeonhole_principle and superposition
principle in mathematics.
***** As axiom or logical fundament[edit] *****
**** Principle of sufficient reason[edit] ****
Main article: Principle_of_sufficient_reason
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.[6] The
principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best
summarized by the following:
      For every entity x, if x exists, then there is a sufficient explanation
      for why x exists.
      For every event e, if e occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation
      for why e occurs.
      For every proposition p, if p is true, then there is a sufficient
      explanation for why p is true.
However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between
the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to
a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.
**** Principle of non-contradiction[edit] ****

made by Lysippos
Main article: Law_of_noncontradiction
According to Aristotle, âIt is impossible for the same thing to belong and
not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.â[7]
For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it
rains and doesn't rain.[8]
**** Principle of excluded middle[edit] ****
Main article: Law_of_excluded_middle
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a
principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by Leibniz as: either
A is B or A isn't B. It is read the following way: either P is true, or its
denial Â¬P is.[9] It is also known as "tertium non datur" ('A third (thing) is
not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental
principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no
contradiction and sufficient reason).
