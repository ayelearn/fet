Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace (/lÉËplÉËs/; French: [pjÉÊ_simÉÌ
laplas]; 23 March 1749 â 5 March 1827) was a French scholar whose work was
important to the development of engineering, mathematics, statistics, physics,
astronomy, and philosophy. He summarized and extended the work of his
predecessors in his five-volume MÃ©canique_CÃ©leste (Celestial_Mechanics)
(1799â1825). This work translated the geometric study of classical_mechanics
to one based on calculus, opening up a broader range of problems. In
statistics, the Bayesian_interpretation of probability was developed mainly by
Laplace.[2]
Laplace formulated Laplace's_equation, and pioneered the Laplace_transform
which appears in many branches of mathematical_physics, a field that he took a
leading role in forming. The Laplacian_differential_operator, widely used in
mathematics, is also named after him. He restated and developed the nebular
hypothesis of the origin_of_the_Solar_System and was one of the first
scientists to postulate the existence of black_holes and the notion of
gravitational_collapse.
Laplace is remembered as one of the greatest scientists of all time. Sometimes
referred to as the French Newton or Newton of France, he has been described as
possessing a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of any of
his contemporaries.[3] He was Napoleon's examiner when Napoleon attended the
Ãcole_Militaire in Paris in 1784. Laplace became a count of the Empire in 1806
and was named a marquis in 1817, after the Bourbon_Restoration.

***** Early years[edit] *****
Some records of Laplace's life were burned in 1925 with the family chÃ¢teau in
Saint_Julien_de_Mailloc, near Lisieux, the home of his great-great-grandson the
Comte de Colbert-Laplace. Others had been destroyed earlier, when his house at
Arcueil near Paris was looted in 1871.[4]
Laplace was born in Beaumont-en-Auge, Normandy on 23 March 1749, a village four
miles west of Pont_l'ÃvÃªque. According to W._W._Rouse_Ball,[5] his father,
Pierre de Laplace, owned and farmed the small estates of Maarquis. His great-
uncle, Maitre Oliver de Laplace, had held the title of Chirurgien Royal. It
would seem that from a pupil he became an usher in the school at Beaumont; but,
having procured a letter of introduction to d'Alembert, he went to Paris to
advance his fortune. However, Karl_Pearson[4] is scathing about the
inaccuracies in Rouse Ball's account and states:
     Indeed Caen was probably in Laplace's day the most intellectually
     active of all the towns of Normandy. It was here that Laplace was
     educated and was provisionally a professor. It was here he wrote his
     first paper published in the MÃ©langes of the Royal Society of Turin,
     Tome iv. 1766â1769, at least two years before he went at 22 or 23
     to Paris in 1771. Thus before he was 20 he was in touch with Lagrange
     in Turin. He did not go to Paris a raw self-taught country lad with
     only a peasant background! In 1765 at the age of sixteen Laplace left
     the "School of the Duke of Orleans" in Beaumont and went to the
     University_of_Caen, where he appears to have studied for five years
     and was a member of the Sphinx. The 'Ãcole_Militaire' of Beaumont
     did not replace the old school until 1776.
His parents, Pierre Laplace and Marie-Anne Sochon, were from comfortable
families. The Laplace family was involved in agriculture until at least 1750,
but Pierre Laplace senior was also a cider merchant and syndic of the town of
Beaumont.
Pierre Simon Laplace attended a school in the village run at a Benedictine
priory, his father intending that he be ordained in the Roman_Catholic_Church.
At sixteen, to further his father's intention, he was sent to the University_of
Caen to read theology.[6]
At the university, he was mentored by two enthusiastic teachers of mathematics,
Christophe_Gadbled and Pierre Le Canu, who awoke his zeal for the subject. Here
Laplace's brilliance as a mathematician was quickly recognised and while still
at Caen he wrote a memoir Sur le Calcul integral aux differences infiniment
petites et aux differences finies. This provided the first intercourse between
Laplace and Lagrange. Lagrange was the senior by thirteen years, and had
recently founded in his native city Turin a journal named Miscellanea
Taurinensia, in which many of his early works were printed and it was in the
fourth volume of this series that Laplace's paper appeared. About this time,
recognising that he had no vocation for the priesthood, he resolved to become a
professional mathematician. Some sources state that he then broke with the
church and became an atheist.[citation_needed] Laplace did not graduate in
theology but left for Paris with a letter of introduction from Le Canu to Jean
le_Rond_d'Alembert who at that time was supreme in scientific circles.[6][7]
According to his great-great-grandson,[4] d'Alembert received him rather
poorly, and to get rid of him gave him a thick mathematics book, saying to come
back when he had read it. When Laplace came back a few days later, d'Alembert
was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that
Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he
realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care.
Another account is that Laplace solved overnight a problem that d'Alembert set
him for submission the following week, then solved a harder problem the
following night. D'Alembert was impressed and recommended him for a teaching
place in the Ãcole_Militaire.[8]
With a secure income and undemanding teaching, Laplace now threw himself into
original research and for the next seventeen years, 1771â1787, he produced
much of his original work in astronomy.[9]
The Calorimeter of Lavoisier and La Place, Encyclopaedia Londinensis, 1801
From 1780â1784, Laplace and French chemist Antoine_Lavoisier collaborated on
several experimental investigations, designing their own equipment for the
task.[10] In 1783 they published their joint paper, Memoir on Heat, in which
they discussed the kinetic theory of molecular motion.[11] In their experiments
they measured the specific_heat of various bodies, and the expansion of metals
with increasing temperature. They also measured the boiling points of ethanol
and ether under pressure.
Laplace further impressed the Marquis_de_Condorcet, and already by 1771 Laplace
felt entitled to membership in the French_Academy_of_Sciences. However, that
year admission went to Alexandre-ThÃ©ophile_Vandermonde and in 1772 to Jacques
Antoine Joseph Cousin. Laplace was disgruntled, and early in 1773 d'Alembert
wrote to Lagrange in Berlin to ask if a position could be found for Laplace
there. However, Condorcet became permanent secretary of the AcadÃ©mie in
February and Laplace was elected associate member on 31 March, at age 24.[12]
In 1773 Laplace read his paper on the invariability of planetary motion in
front of the Academy des Sciences. That March he was elected to the academy, a
place where he conducted the majority of his science.[13]
On 15 March 1788,[14][4] at the age of thirty-nine, Laplace married Marie-
Charlotte de Courty de Romanges, an eighteen-year-old woman from a 'good'
family in BesanÃ§on.[15] The wedding was celebrated at Saint-Sulpice,_Paris.
The couple had a son, Charles-Ãmile (1789â1874), and a daughter, Sophie-
Suzanne (1792â1813).[16][17]
***** Analysis, probability, and astronomical stability[edit] *****
Laplace's early published work in 1771 started with differential_equations and
finite_differences but he was already starting to think about the mathematical
and philosophical concepts of probability and statistics.[18] However, before
his election to the AcadÃ©mie in 1773, he had already drafted two papers that
would establish his reputation. The first, MÃ©moire sur la probabilitÃ© des
causes par les Ã©vÃ©nements was ultimately published in 1774 while the second
paper, published in 1776, further elaborated his statistical thinking and also
began his systematic work on celestial_mechanics and the stability of the Solar
System. The two disciplines would always be interlinked in his mind. "Laplace
took probability as an instrument for repairing defects in knowledge."[19]
Laplace's work on probability and statistics is discussed below with his mature
work on the analytic theory of probabilities.
**** Stability of the Solar System[edit] ****
Sir Isaac_Newton had published his Philosophiae_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica
in 1687 in which he gave a derivation of Kepler's_laws, which describe the
motion of the planets, from his laws_of_motion and his law_of_universal
gravitation. However, though Newton had privately developed the methods of
calculus, all his published work used cumbersome geometric reasoning,
unsuitable to account for the more subtle higher-order effects of interactions
between the planets. Newton himself had doubted the possibility of a
mathematical solution to the whole, even concluding that periodic divine
intervention was necessary to guarantee the stability of the Solar System.
Dispensing with the hypothesis of divine intervention would be a major activity
of Laplace's scientific life.[20] It is now generally regarded that Laplace's
methods on their own, though vital to the development of the theory, are not
sufficiently precise to demonstrate the stability_of_the_Solar_System,[21] and
indeed, the Solar System is understood to be chaotic, although it happens to be
fairly stable.
One particular problem from observational_astronomy was the apparent
instability whereby Jupiter's orbit appeared to be shrinking while that of
Saturn was expanding. The problem had been tackled by Leonhard_Euler in 1748
and Joseph_Louis_Lagrange in 1763 but without success.[22] In 1776, Laplace
published a memoir in which he first explored the possible influences of a
purported luminiferous_ether or of a law of gravitation that did not act
instantaneously. He ultimately returned to an intellectual investment in
Newtonian gravity.[23] Euler and Lagrange had made a practical approximation by
ignoring small terms in the equations of motion. Laplace noted that though the
terms themselves were small, when integrated over time they could become
important. Laplace carried his analysis into the higher-order terms, up to and
including the cubic. Using this more exact analysis, Laplace concluded that any
two planets and the Sun must be in mutual equilibrium and thereby launched his
work on the stability of the Solar System.[24] Gerald_James_Whitrow described
the achievement as "the most important advance in physical astronomy since
Newton".[20]
Laplace had a wide knowledge of all sciences and dominated all discussions in
the AcadÃ©mie.[25] Laplace seems to have regarded analysis merely as a means of
attacking physical problems, though the ability with which he invented the
necessary analysis is almost phenomenal. As long as his results were true he
took but little trouble to explain the steps by which he arrived at them; he
never studied elegance or symmetry in his processes, and it was sufficient for
him if he could by any means solve the particular question he was discussing.

***** Tidal dynamics[edit] *****
Main article: Theory_of_tides
**** Dynamic theory of tides[edit] ****
While Newton explained the tides by describing the tide-generating forces and
Bernoulli gave a description of the static reaction of the waters on Earth to
the tidal potential, the dynamic theory of tides, developed by Laplace in 1775,
[26] describes the ocean's real reaction to tidal_forces.[27] Laplace's theory
of ocean tides took into account friction, resonance and natural periods of
ocean basins. It predicted the large amphidromic systems in the world's ocean
basins and explains the oceanic tides that are actually observed.[28][29]
[Newton's_three-body_model]
The equilibrium theory, based on the gravitational gradient from the Sun and
Moon but ignoring the Earth's rotation, the effects of continents, and other
important effects, could not explain the real ocean tides.[30][31][32][28][33]
[34][35][36][37]
[Newton's_three-body_model]
Since measurements have confirmed the theory, many things have possible
explanations now, like how the tides interact with deep sea ridges and chains
of seamounts give rise to deep eddies that transport nutrients from the deep to
the surface.[38] The equilibrium tide theory calculates the height of the tide
wave of less than half a meter, while the dynamic theory explains why tides are
up to 15 meters.[39] Satellite observations confirm the accuracy of the dynamic
theory, and the tides worldwide are now measured to within a few centimeters.
[40][41] Measurements from the CHAMP satellite closely match the models based
on the TOPEX data.[42][43][44] Accurate models of tides worldwide are essential
for research since the variations due to tides must be removed from
measurements when calculating gravity and changes in sea levels.[45]

In 1776, Laplace formulated a single set of linear partial_differential
equations, for tidal flow described as a barotropic two-dimensional sheet flow.
Coriolis_effects are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace
obtained these equations by simplifying the fluid_dynamic equations. But they
can also be derived from energy integrals via Lagrange's_equation.
For a fluid sheet of average thickness D, the vertical tidal elevation Î¶, as
well as the horizontal velocity components u and v (in the latitude Ï and
longitude Î» directions, respectively) satisfy Laplace's tidal equations:[46]

where Î© is the angular_frequency of the planet's rotation, g is the planet's
gravitational acceleration at the mean ocean surface, a is the planetary
radius, and U is the external gravitational tidal-forcing potential.
William_Thomson_(Lord_Kelvin) rewrote Laplace's momentum terms using the curl
to find an equation for vorticity. Under certain conditions this can be further
rewritten as a conservation of vorticity.
***** On the figure of the Earth[edit] *****
During the years 1784â1787 he published some memoirs of exceptional power.
Prominent among these is one read in 1783, reprinted as Part II of ThÃ©orie du
Mouvement et de la figure elliptique des planÃ¨tes in 1784, and in the third
volume of the MÃ©canique cÃ©leste. In this work, Laplace completely determined
the attraction of a spheroid on a particle outside it. This is memorable for
the introduction into analysis of spherical_harmonics or Laplace's
coefficients, and also for the development of the use of what we would now call
the gravitational_potential in celestial_mechanics.
**** Spherical harmonics[edit] ****
Spherical harmonics.
In 1783, in a paper sent to the AcadÃ©mie, Adrien-Marie_Legendre had introduced
what are now known as associated_Legendre_functions.[9] If two points in a
plane have polar_co-ordinates (r, Î¸) and (r ', Î¸'), where r ' â¥ r, then, by
elementary manipulation, the reciprocal of the distance between the points, d,
can be written as:
           1 d   =   1  r &#x2032;      [  1 &#x2212; 2 cos &#x2061;
      (  &#x03B8; &#x2032;  &#x2212; &#x03B8; )   r  r &#x2032;    +   (   r  r
      &#x2032;    )   2    ]   &#x2212;    1 2      .   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {1}{d}}={\frac {1}{r'}}\left[1-2\cos(\theta '-\theta ){\frac {r}
      {r'}}+\left({\frac {r}{r'}}\right)^{2}\right]^{-{\tfrac {1}{2}}}.}  [
      {\frac  {1}{d}}={\frac  {1}{r'}}\left[1-2\cos(\theta '-\theta ){\frac
      {r}{r'}}+\left({\frac  {r}{r'}}\right)^{2}\right]^{{-{\tfrac  {1}{2}}}}.]
This expression can be expanded_in_powers of r/r ' using Newton's_generalised
binomial_theorem to give:
           1 d   =   1  r &#x2032;     &#x2211;  k = 0   &#x221E;    P  k   0
      ( cos &#x2061; (  &#x03B8; &#x2032;  &#x2212; &#x03B8; ) )   (   r  r
      &#x2032;    )   k   .   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{d}}={\frac {1}{r'}}\sum
      _{k=0}^{\infty }P_{k}^{0}(\cos(\theta '-\theta ))\left({\frac {r}
      {r'}}\right)^{k}.}  [{\frac  {1}{d}}={\frac  {1}{r'}}\sum _{{k=0}}^
      {\infty }P_{k}^{0}(\cos(\theta '-\theta ))\left({\frac  {r}{r'}}\right)^
      {k}.]
The sequence of functions P0k(cos Ï) is the set of so-called "associated
Legendre functions" and their usefulness arises from the fact that every
function of the points on a circle can be expanded as a series of them.[9]
Laplace, with scant regard for credit to Legendre, made the non-trivial
extension of the result to three_dimensions to yield a more general set of
functions, the spherical_harmonics or Laplace coefficients. The latter term is
not in common use now.[9]
**** Potential theory[edit] ****
This paper is also remarkable for the development of the idea of the scalar
potential.[9] The gravitational force acting on a body is, in modern language,
a vector, having magnitude and direction. A potential function is a scalar
function that defines how the vectors will behave. A scalar function is
computationally and conceptually easier to deal with than a vector function.
Alexis_Clairaut had first suggested the idea in 1743 while working on a similar
problem though he was using Newtonian-type geometric reasoning. Laplace
described Clairaut's work as being "in the class of the most beautiful
mathematical productions".[47] However, Rouse Ball alleges that the idea "was
appropriated from Joseph_Louis_Lagrange, who had used it in his memoirs of
1773, 1777 and 1780".[9] The term "potential" itself was due to Daniel
Bernoulli, who introduced it in his 1738 memoire Hydrodynamica. However,
according to Rouse Ball, the term "potential function" was not actually used
(to refer to a function V of the coordinates of space in Laplace's sense) until
George_Green's 1828 An_Essay_on_the_Application_of_Mathematical_Analysis_to_the
Theories_of_Electricity_and_Magnetism.[48][49]
Laplace applied the language of calculus to the potential function and showed
that it always satisfies the differential_equation:[9]
          &#x2207;  2   V =     &#x2202;  2   V   &#x2202;  x  2      +
      &#x2202;  2   V   &#x2202;  y  2      +     &#x2202;  2   V   &#x2202;  z
      2      = 0.   {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}V={\partial ^{2}V \over \partial
      x^{2}}+{\partial ^{2}V \over \partial y^{2}}+{\partial ^{2}V \over
      \partial z^{2}}=0.}  [\nabla ^{2}V={\partial ^{2}V \over \partial x^{2}}+
      {\partial ^{2}V \over \partial y^{2}}+{\partial ^{2}V \over \partial z^
      {2}}=0.]
An analogous result for the velocity_potential of a fluid had been obtained
some years previously by Leonhard_Euler.[50][51]
Laplace's subsequent work on gravitational attraction was based on this result.
The quantity â2V has been termed the concentration of V and its value at any
point indicates the "excess" of the value of V there over its mean value in the
neighbourhood of the point. Laplace's_equation, a special case of Poisson's
equation, appears ubiquitously in mathematical physics. The concept of a
potential occurs in fluid_dynamics, electromagnetism and other areas. Rouse
Ball speculated that it might be seen as "the outward sign" of one of the a
priori forms in Kant's_theory_of_perception.[9]
The spherical harmonics turn out to be critical to practical solutions of
Laplace's equation. Laplace's equation in spherical_coordinates, such as are
used for mapping the sky, can be simplified, using the method of separation_of
variables into a radial part, depending solely on distance from the centre
point, and an angular or spherical part. The solution to the spherical part of
the equation can be expressed as a series of Laplace's spherical harmonics,
simplifying practical computation.
***** Planetary and lunar inequalities[edit] *****
**** JupiterâSaturn great inequality[edit] ****
Laplace presented a memoir on planetary inequalities in three sections, in
1784, 1785, and 1786. This dealt mainly with the identification and explanation
of the perturbations now known as the "great JupiterâSaturn inequality".
Laplace solved a longstanding problem in the study and prediction of the
movements of these planets. He showed by general considerations, first, that
the mutual action of two planets could never cause large changes in the
eccentricities and inclinations of their orbits; but then, even more
importantly, that peculiarities arose in the JupiterâSaturn system because of
the near approach to commensurability of the mean motions of Jupiter and
Saturn.[52]
In this context commensurability means that the ratio of the two planets' mean
motions is very nearly equal to a ratio between a pair of small whole numbers.
Two periods of Saturn's orbit around the Sun almost equal five of Jupiter's.
The corresponding difference between multiples of the mean motions, (2nJ â
5nS), corresponds to a period of nearly 900 years, and it occurs as a small
divisor in the integration of a very small perturbing force with this same
period. As a result, the integrated perturbations with this period are
disproportionately large, about 0.8Â° degrees of arc in orbital longitude for
Saturn and about 0.3Â° for Jupiter.
Further developments of these theorems on planetary motion were given in his
two memoirs of 1788 and 1789, but with the aid of Laplace's discoveries, the
tables of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn could at last be made much more
accurate. It was on the basis of Laplace's theory that Delambre computed his
astronomical tables.[9]

Laplace now set himself the task to write a work which should "offer a complete
solution of the great mechanical problem presented by the Solar System, and
bring theory to coincide so closely with observation that empirical equations
should no longer find a place in astronomical tables." The result is embodied
in the Exposition du systÃ¨me du monde and the MÃ©canique cÃ©leste.[9]
The former was published in 1796, and gives a general explanation of the
phenomena, but omits all details. It contains a summary of the history of
astronomy. This summary procured for its author the honour of admission to the
forty of the French Academy and is commonly esteemed one of the masterpieces of
French literature, though it is not altogether reliable for the later periods
of which it treats.[9]
Laplace developed the nebular_hypothesis of the formation of the Solar System,
first suggested by Emanuel_Swedenborg and expanded by Immanuel_Kant, a
hypothesis that continues to dominate accounts of the origin of planetary
systems. According to Laplace's description of the hypothesis, the Solar System
had evolved from a globular mass of incandescent gas rotating around an axis
through its centre_of_mass. As it cooled, this mass contracted, and successive
rings broke off from its outer edge. These rings in their turn cooled, and
finally condensed into the planets, while the Sun represented the central core
which was still left. On this view, Laplace predicted that the more distant
planets would be older than those nearer the Sun.[9][53]
As mentioned, the idea of the nebular hypothesis had been outlined by Immanuel
Kant in 1755,[53] and he had also suggested "meteoric aggregations" and tidal
friction as causes affecting the formation of the Solar System. Laplace was
probably aware of this, but, like many writers of his time, he generally did
not reference the work of others.[4]
Laplace's analytical discussion of the Solar System is given in his MÃ©canique
cÃ©leste published in five volumes. The first two volumes, published in 1799,
contain methods for calculating the motions of the planets, determining their
figures, and resolving tidal problems. The third and fourth volumes, published
in 1802 and 1805, contain applications of these methods, and several
astronomical tables. The fifth volume, published in 1825, is mainly historical,
but it gives as appendices the results of Laplace's latest researches.
Laplace's own investigations embodied in it are so numerous and valuable that
it is regrettable to have to add that many results are appropriated from other
writers with scanty or no acknowledgement, and the conclusions â which have
been described as the organised result of a century of patient toil â are
frequently mentioned as if they were due to Laplace.[9]
Jean-Baptiste_Biot, who assisted Laplace in revising it for the press, says
that Laplace himself was frequently unable to recover the details in the chain
of reasoning, and, if satisfied that the conclusions were correct, he was
content to insert the constantly recurring formula, "Il est aisÃ© Ã  voir que
..." ("It is easy to see that ..."). The MÃ©canique cÃ©leste is not only the
translation of Newton's Principia into the language of the differential
calculus, but it completes parts of which Newton had been unable to fill in the
details. The work was carried forward in a more finely tuned form in FÃ©lix
Tisserand's TraitÃ© de mÃ©canique cÃ©leste (1889â1896), but Laplace's
treatise will always remain a standard authority.[9] In the years 1784â1787,
Laplace produced some memoirs of exceptional power. The significant among these
was one issued in 1784, and reprinted in the third volume of the MÃ©chanique
cÃ©leste.[citation_needed] In this work he completely determined the attraction
of a spheroid on a particle outside it. This is known for the introduction into
analysis of the potential, a useful mathematical concept of broad applicability
to the physical sciences.
***** Black holes[edit] *****
Laplace also came close to propounding the concept of the black_hole. He
suggested that there could be massive stars whose gravity is so great that not
even light could escape from their surface (see escape_velocity).[54][1][55]
[56]
***** Arcueil[edit] *****
Laplace's house at Arcueil to the south of Paris.
Main article: Society_of_Arcueil
In 1806, Laplace bought a house in Arcueil, then a village and not yet absorbed
into the Paris conurbation. The chemist Claude_Louis_Berthollet was a neighbour
â their gardens were not separated[57] â and the pair formed the nucleus of
an informal scientific circle, latterly known as the Society of Arcueil.
Because of their closeness to Napoleon, Laplace and Berthollet effectively
controlled advancement in the scientific establishment and admission to the
more prestigious offices. The Society built up a complex pyramid of patronage.
[58] In 1806, Laplace was also elected a foreign member of the Royal_Swedish
Academy_of_Sciences.
***** Analytic theory of probabilities[edit] *****
In 1812, Laplace issued his ThÃ©orie analytique des probabilitÃ©s in which he
laid down many fundamental results in statistics. The first half of this
treatise was concerned with probability methods and problems, the second half
with statistical methods and applications. Laplace's proofs are not always
rigorous according to the standards of a later day, and his perspective slides
back and forth between the Bayesian and non-Bayesian views with an ease that
makes some of his investigations difficult to follow, but his conclusions
remain basically sound even in those few situations where his analysis goes
astray.[59] In 1819, he published a popular account of his work on probability.
This book bears the same relation to the ThÃ©orie des probabilitÃ©s that the
SystÃ¨me du monde does to the MÃ©chanique cÃ©leste.[9] In its emphasis on the
analytical importance of probabilistic problems, especially in the context of
the "approximation of formula functions of large numbers," Laplace's work goes
beyond the contemporary view which almost exclusively considered aspects of
practical applicability.[60] Laplace's ThÃ©orie analytique remained the most
influential book of mathematical probability theory to the end of the 19th
century. The general relevance for statistics of Laplacian error theory was
appreciated only by the end of the 19th century. However, it influenced the
further development of a largely analytically oriented probability theory.
**** Inductive probability[edit] ****
In his Essai philosophique sur les probabilitÃ©s (1814), Laplace set out a
mathematical system of inductive_reasoning based on probability, which we would
today recognise as Bayesian. He begins the text with a series of principles of
probability, the first six being:
   1. Probability is the ratio of the "favored events" to the total possible
      events.
   2. The first principle assumes equal probabilities for all events. When this
      is not true, we must first determine the probabilities of each event.
      Then, the probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible
      favoured events.
   3. For independent events, the probability of the occurrence of all is the
      probability of each multiplied together.
   4. For events not independent, the probability of event B following event A
      (or event A causing B) is the probability of A multiplied by the
      probability that A and B both occur.
   5. The probability that A will occur, given that B has occurred, is the
      probability of A and B occurring divided by the probability of B.
   6. Three corollaries are given for the sixth principle, which amount to
      Bayesian probability. Where event Ai â {A1, A2, ... An} exhausts the
      list of possible causes for event B, Pr(B) = Pr(A1, A2, ..., An). Then
                     Pr (  A  i   &#x2223; B ) = Pr (  A  i   )    Pr ( B
                  &#x2223;  A  i   )    &#x2211;  j   Pr (  A  j   ) Pr ( B
                  &#x2223;  A  j   )    .   {\displaystyle \Pr(A_{i}\mid B)=\Pr
                  (A_{i}){\frac {\Pr(B\mid A_{i})}{\sum _{j}\Pr(A_{j})\Pr(B\mid
                  A_{j})}}.}  [{\displaystyle \Pr(A_{i}\mid B)=\Pr(A_{i}){\frac
                  {\Pr(B\mid A_{i})}{\sum _{j}\Pr(A_{j})\Pr(B\mid A_{j})}}.}]
One well-known formula arising from his system is the rule_of_succession, given
as principle seven. Suppose that some trial has only two possible outcomes,
labelled "success" and "failure". Under the assumption that little or nothing
is known a priori about the relative plausibilities of the outcomes, Laplace
derived a formula for the probability that the next trial will be a success.
         Pr (  next outcome is success  ) =    s + 1   n + 2
      {\displaystyle \Pr({\text{next outcome is success}})={\frac {s+1}{n+2}}}
      [\Pr({\text{next outcome is success}})={\frac  {s+1}{n+2}}]
where s is the number of previously observed successes and n is the total
number of observed trials. It is still used as an estimator for the probability
of an event if we know the event space, but have only a small number of
samples.
The rule of succession has been subject to much criticism, partly due to the
example which Laplace chose to illustrate it. He calculated that the
probability that the sun will rise tomorrow, given that it has never failed to
in the past, was
         Pr (  sun will rise tomorrow  ) =    d + 1   d + 2      {\displaystyle
      \Pr({\text{sun will rise tomorrow}})={\frac {d+1}{d+2}}}  [\Pr({\text{sun
      will rise tomorrow}})={\frac  {d+1}{d+2}}]
where d is the number of times the sun has risen in the past. This result has
been derided as absurd, and some authors have concluded that all applications
of the Rule of Succession are absurd by extension. However, Laplace was fully
aware of the absurdity of the result; immediately following the example, he
wrote, "But this number [i.e., the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow]
is far greater for him who, seeing in the totality of phenomena the principle
regulating the days and seasons, realizes that nothing at the present moment
can arrest the course of it."[61]
**** Probability-generating function[edit] ****
The method of estimating the ratio of the number of favourable cases to the
whole number of possible cases had been previously indicated by Laplace in a
paper written in 1779. It consists of treating the successive values of any
function as the coefficients in the expansion of another function, with
reference to a different variable. The latter is therefore called the
probability-generating_function of the former. Laplace then shows how, by means
of interpolation, these coefficients may be determined from the generating
function. Next he attacks the converse problem, and from the coefficients he
finds the generating function; this is effected by the solution of a finite
difference_equation.[9]
**** Least squares and central limit theorem[edit] ****
The fourth chapter of this treatise includes an exposition of the method_of
least_squares, a remarkable testimony to Laplace's command over the processes
of analysis. In 1805 Legendre had published the method of least squares, making
no attempt to tie it to the theory of probability. In 1809 Gauss had derived
the normal distribution from the principle that the arithmetic mean of
observations gives the most probable value for the quantity measured; then,
turning this argument back upon itself, he showed that, if the errors of
observation are normally distributed, the least squares estimates give the most
probable values for the coefficients in regression situations. These two works
seem to have spurred Laplace to complete work toward a treatise on probability
he had contemplated as early as 1783.[59]
In two important papers in 1810 and 1811, Laplace first developed the
characteristic_function as a tool for large-sample theory and proved the first
general central_limit_theorem. Then in a supplement to his 1810 paper written
after he had seen Gauss's work, he showed that the central limit theorem
provided a Bayesian justification for least squares: if one were combining
observations, each one of which was itself the mean of a large number of
independent observations, then the least squares estimates would not only
maximise the likelihood function, considered as a posterior distribution, but
also minimise the expected posterior error, all this without any assumption as
to the error distribution or a circular appeal to the principle of the
arithmetic mean.[59] In 1811 Laplace took a different non-Bayesian tack.
Considering a linear regression problem, he restricted his attention to linear
unbiased estimators of the linear coefficients. After showing that members of
this class were approximately normally distributed if the number of
observations was large, he argued that least squares provided the "best" linear
estimators. Here it is "best" in the sense that it minimised the asymptotic
variance and thus both minimised the expected absolute value of the error, and
maximised the probability that the estimate would lie in any symmetric interval
about the unknown coefficient, no matter what the error distribution. His
derivation included the joint limiting distribution of the least squares
estimators of two parameters.[59]
***** Laplace's demon[edit] *****
Main article: Laplace's_demon
In 1814, Laplace published what is usually known as the first articulation of
causal_or_scientific_determinism:[62]
     We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its
     past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain
     moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all
     positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect
     were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would
     embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of
     the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect
     nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be
     present before its eyes.
     â Pierre Simon Laplace, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities[63]
This intellect is often referred to as Laplace's demon (in the same vein as
Maxwell's_demon) and sometimes Laplace's Superman (after Hans_Reichenbach).
Laplace, himself, did not use the word "demon", which was a later
embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: "Une
intelligence ... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir comme le
passÃ©, serait prÃ©sent Ã  ses yeux."
Even though Laplace is known as the first to express such ideas about causal
determinism, his view is very similar to the one proposed by Boscovich as early
as 1763 in his book Theoria philosophiae naturalis.[64]
***** Laplace transforms[edit] *****
Main article: Laplace_transform_Â§ History
As early as 1744, Euler, followed by Lagrange, had started looking for
solutions of differential_equations in the form:[65]
         z = &#x222B; X ( x )  e  a x    d x  &#xA0;and&#xA0;  z = &#x222B; X
      ( x )  x  a    d x .   {\displaystyle z=\int X(x)e^{ax}\,dx{\text{ and
      }}z=\int X(x)x^{a}\,dx.}  [z=\int X(x)e^{{ax}}\,dx{\text{  and  }}z=\int
      X(x)x^{a}\,dx.]
The Laplace transform has form:
         F ( s ) = &#x222B; f ( t )  e  &#x2212; s t    d t   {\displaystyle F
      (s)=\int f(t)e^{-st}\,dt}  [{\displaystyle F(s)=\int f(t)e^{-st}\,dt}]
This integral operator transforms a function of time (t) into a function of
position or space (s).
In 1785, Laplace took the key forward step in using integrals of this form to
transform a whole differential equation from a function of time into a lower
order function of space; The transformed equation was easier to solve than the
original because algebra could be used to manipulate the differential equation
into a simpler form. The inverse Laplace transform was then taken to convert
the simplified function of space back into a function of time.[66][67]
***** Other discoveries and accomplishments[edit] *****
**** Mathematics[edit] ****
Amongst the other discoveries of Laplace in pure and applied mathematics are:
    * Discussion, contemporaneously with Alexandre-ThÃ©ophile_Vandermonde, of
      the general theory of determinants, (1772);[9]
    * Proof that every equation of an odd degree must have at least one real
      quadratic factor;[9]
    * Laplace's_method for approximating integrals
    * Solution of the linear_partial_differential_equation of the second order;
      [9]
    * He was the first to consider the difficult problems involved in equations
      of mixed differences, and to prove that the solution of an equation in
      finite differences of the first degree and the second order might always
      be obtained in the form of a continued_fraction;[9] and
    * In his theory of probabilities:
          o de_MoivreâLaplace_theorem that approximates binomial distribution
            with a normal distribution
          o Evaluation of several common definite_integrals;[9] and
          o General proof of the Lagrange_reversion_theorem.[9]
**** Surface tension[edit] ****
Main article: YoungâLaplace_equation_Â§ History
Laplace built upon the qualitative work of Thomas_Young to develop the theory
of capillary_action and the YoungâLaplace_equation.
**** Speed of sound[edit] ****
Laplace in 1816 was the first to point out that the speed_of_sound in air
depends on the heat_capacity_ratio. Newton's original theory gave too low a
value, because it does not take account of the adiabatic compression of the air
which results in a local rise in temperature and pressure. Laplace's
investigations in practical physics were confined to those carried on by him
jointly with Lavoisier in the years 1782 to 1784 on the specific_heat of
various bodies.[9]
***** Politics[edit] *****
**** Minister of the Interior[edit] ****
In his early years Laplace was careful never to become involved in politics, or
indeed in life outside the AcadÃ©mie des sciences. He prudently withdrew from
Paris during the most violent part of the Revolution.[68]
In November 1799, immediately after seizing power in the coup of 18_Brumaire,
Napoleon appointed Laplace to the post of Minister_of_the_Interior. The
appointment, however, lasted only six weeks, after which Lucien_Bonaparte,
Napoleon's brother, was given the post. Evidently, once Napoleon's grip on
power was secure, there was no need for a prestigious but inexperienced
scientist in the government.[69] Napoleon later (in his MÃ©moires de Sainte
HÃ©lÃ¨ne) wrote of Laplace's dismissal as follows:[9]
     GÃ©omÃ¨tre de premier rang, Laplace ne tarda pas Ã  se montrer
     administrateur plus que mÃ©diocre; dÃ¨s son premier travail nous
     reconnÃ»mes que nous nous Ã©tions trompÃ©. Laplace ne saisissait
     aucune question sous son vÃ©ritable point de vue: il cherchait des
     subtilitÃ©s partout, n'avait que des idÃ©es problÃ©matiques, et
     portait enfin l'esprit des 'infiniment petits' jusque dans
     l'administration.
     (Geometrician of the first rank, Laplace was not long in showing
     himself a worse than average administrator; from his first actions in
     office we recognized our mistake. Laplace did not consider any
     question from the right angle: he sought subtleties everywhere,
     conceived only problems, and finally carried the spirit of
     "infinitesimals" into the administration.)
Grattan-Guinness, however, describes these remarks as "tendentious", since
there seems to be no doubt that Laplace "was only appointed as a short-term
figurehead, a place-holder while Napoleon consolidated power".[69]
**** From Bonaparte to the Bourbons[edit] ****
Laplace.
Although Laplace was removed from office, it was desirable to retain his
allegiance. He was accordingly raised to the senate, and to the third volume of
the MÃ©canique cÃ©leste he prefixed a note that of all the truths therein
contained the most precious to the author was the declaration he thus made of
his devotion towards the peacemaker of Europe. In copies sold after the Bourbon
Restoration this was struck out. (Pearson points out that the censor would not
have allowed it anyway.) In 1814 it was evident that the empire was falling;
Laplace hastened to tender his services to the Bourbons, and in 1817 during the
Restoration he was rewarded with the title of marquis.
According to Rouse Ball, the contempt that his more honest colleagues felt for
his conduct in the matter may be read in the pages of Paul_Louis_Courier. His
knowledge was useful on the numerous scientific commissions on which he served,
and, says Rouse Ball, probably accounts for the manner in which his political
insincerity was overlooked.[9]
Roger Hahn in his 2005 biography disputes this portrayal of Laplace as an
opportunist and turncoat, pointing out that, like many in France, he had
followed the debacle of Napoleon's Russian campaign with serious misgivings.
The Laplaces, whose only daughter Sophie had died in childbirth in September
1813, were in fear for the safety of their son Ãmile, who was on the eastern
front with the emperor. Napoleon had originally come to power promising
stability, but it was clear that he had overextended himself, putting the
nation at peril. It was at this point that Laplace's loyalty began to weaken.
Although he still had easy access to Napoleon, his personal relations with the
emperor cooled considerably. As a grieving father, he was particularly cut to
the quick by Napoleon's insensitivity in an exchange related by Jean-Antoine
Chaptal: "On his return from the rout_in_Leipzig, he [Napoleon] accosted Mr
Laplace: 'Oh! I see that you have grown thinâSire, I have lost my
daughterâOh! that's not a reason for losing weight. You are a mathematician;
put this event in an equation, and you will find that it adds up to zero.'"[70]
**** Political philosophy[edit] ****
In the second edition (1814) of the Essai philosophique, Laplace added some
revealing comments on politics and governance. Since it is, he says, "the
practice of the eternal principles of reason, justice and humanity that produce
and preserve societies, there is a great advantage to adhere to these
principles, and a great inadvisability to deviate from them".[71][72] Noting
"the depths of misery into which peoples have been cast" when ambitious leaders
disregard these principles, Laplace makes a veiled criticism of Napoleon's
conduct: "Every time a great power intoxicated by the love of conquest aspires
to universal domination, the sense of liberty among the unjustly threatened
nations breeds a coalition to which it always succumbs." Laplace argues that
"in the midst of the multiple causes that direct and restrain various states,
natural limits" operate, within which it is "important for the stability as
well as the prosperity of empires to remain". States that transgress these
limits cannot avoid being "reverted" to them, "just as is the case when the
waters of the seas whose floor has been lifted by violent tempests sink back to
their level by the action of gravity".[73][74]
About the political upheavals he had witnessed, Laplace formulated a set of
principles derived from physics to favour evolutionary over revolutionary
change:
     Let us apply to the political and moral sciences the method founded
     upon observation and calculation, which has served us so well in the
     natural sciences. Let us not offer fruitless and often injurious
     resistance to the inevitable benefits derived from the progress of
     enlightenment; but let us change our institutions and the usages that
     we have for a long time adopted only with extreme caution. We know
     from past experience the drawbacks they can cause, but we are unaware
     of the extent of ills that change may produce. In the face of this
     ignorance, the theory of probability instructs us to avoid all
     change, especially to avoid sudden changes which in the moral as well
     as the physical world never occur without a considerable loss of
     vital force.[75]
In these lines, Laplace expressed the views he had arrived at after
experiencing the Revolution and the Empire. He believed that the stability of
nature, as revealed through scientific findings, provided the model that best
helped to preserve the human species. "Such views," Hahn comments, "were also
of a piece with his steadfast character."[74]
***** Death[edit] *****
Laplace died in Paris in 1827. His brain was removed by his physician,
FranÃ§ois_Magendie, and kept for many years, eventually being displayed in a
roving anatomical museum in Britain. It was reportedly smaller than the average
brain.[4] Laplace was buried at PÃ¨re_Lachaise in Paris but in 1888 his remains
were moved to Saint_Julien_de_Mailloc in the canton of Orbec and reinterred on
the family estate.[76] The tomb is situated on a hill overlooking the village
of St Julien de Mailloc, Normandy, France.

***** Religious opinions[edit] *****
**** I had no need of that hypothesis[edit] ****
A frequently cited but potentially apocryphal interaction between Laplace and
Napoleon purportedly concerns the existence of God. Although the conversation
in question did occur, the exact words Laplace used and his intended meaning
are not known. A typical version is provided by Rouse Ball:[9]
     Laplace went in state to Napoleon to present a copy of his work, and
     the following account of the interview is well authenticated, and so
     characteristic of all the parties concerned that I quote it in full.
     Someone had told Napoleon that the book contained no mention of the
     name of God; Napoleon, who was fond of putting embarrassing
     questions, received it with the remark, 'M. Laplace, they tell me you
     have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have
     never even mentioned its Creator.' Laplace, who, though the most
     supple of politicians, was as stiff as a martyr on every point of his
     philosophy, drew himself up and answered bluntly, Je n'avais pas
     besoin de cette hypothÃ¨se-lÃ . ("I had no need of that hypothesis.")
     Napoleon, greatly amused, told this reply to Lagrange, who exclaimed,
     Ah! c'est une belle hypothÃ¨se; Ã§a explique beaucoup de choses.
     ("Ah, it is a fine hypothesis; it explains many things.")
An earlier report, although without the mention of Laplace's name, is found in
Antommarchi's The_Last_Moments_of_Napoleon (1825):[77]
     Je m'entretenais avec L ..... je le fÃ©licitais d'un ouvrage qu'il
     venait de publier et lui demandais comment le nom de Dieu, qui se
     reproduisait sans cesse sous la plume de Lagrange, ne s'Ã©tait pas
     prÃ©sentÃ© une seule fois sous la sienne. C'est, me rÃ©pondit-il, que
     je n'ai pas eu besoin de cette hypothÃ¨se. ("While speaking with L
     ..... I congratulated him on a work which he had just published and
     asked him how the name of God, which appeared endlessly in the works
     of Lagrange, didn't occur even once in his. He replied that he had no
     need of that hypothesis.")
In 1884, however, the astronomer HervÃ©_Faye[78][79] affirmed that this account
of Laplace's exchange with Napoleon presented a "strangely transformed"
(Ã©trangement transformÃ©e) or garbled version of what had actually happened.
It was not God that Laplace had treated as a hypothesis, but merely his
intervention at a determinate point:
     In fact Laplace never said that. Here, I believe, is what truly
     happened. Newton, believing that the secular perturbations which he
     had sketched out in his theory would in the long run end up
     destroying the Solar System, says somewhere that God was obliged to
     intervene from time to time to remedy the evil and somehow keep the
     system working properly. This, however, was a pure supposition
     suggested to Newton by an incomplete view of the conditions of the
     stability of our little world. Science was not yet advanced enough at
     that time to bring these conditions into full view. But Laplace, who
     had discovered them by a deep analysis, would have replied to the
     First_Consul that Newton had wrongly invoked the intervention of God
     to adjust from time to time the machine of the world (la machine du
     monde) and that he, Laplace, had no need of such an assumption. It
     was not God, therefore, that Laplace treated as a hypothesis, but his
     intervention in a certain place.
Laplace's younger colleague, the astronomer FranÃ§ois_Arago, who gave his
eulogy before the French Academy in 1827,[80] told Faye of an attempt by
Laplace to keep the garbled version of his interaction with Napoleon out of
circulation. Faye writes:[78][79]
     I have it on the authority of M. Arago that Laplace, warned shortly
     before his death that that anecdote was about to be published in a
     biographical collection, had requested him [Arago] to demand its
     deletion by the publisher. It was necessary to either explain or
     delete it, and the second way was the easiest. But, unfortunately, it
     was neither deleted nor explained.
The Swiss-American historian of mathematics Florian_Cajori appears to have been
unaware of Faye's research, but in 1893 he came to a similar conclusion.[81]
Stephen_Hawking said in 1999,[62] "I don't think that Laplace was claiming that
God does not exist. It's just that he doesn't intervene, to break the laws of
Science."
The only eyewitness account of Laplace's interaction with Napoleon is from the
entry for 8 August 1802 in the diary of the British astronomer Sir William
Herschel:[82]
     The first Consul then asked a few questions relating to Astronomy and
     the construction of the heavens to which I made such answers as
     seemed to give him great satisfaction. He also addressed himself to
     Mr Laplace on the same subject, and held a considerable argument with
     him in which he differed from that eminent mathematician. The
     difference was occasioned by an exclamation of the first Consul, who
     asked in a tone of exclamation or admiration (when we were speaking
     of the extent of the sidereal heavens): 'And who is the author of all
     this!' Mons. De la Place wished to shew that a chain of natural
     causes would account for the construction and preservation of the
     wonderful system. This the first Consul rather opposed. Much may be
     said on the subject; by joining the arguments of both we shall be led
     to 'Nature and nature's God'.
Since this makes no mention of Laplace saying, "I had no need of that
hypothesis," Daniel_Johnson[83] argues that "Laplace never used the words
attributed to him." Arago's testimony, however, appears to imply that he did,
only not in reference to the existence of God.
**** Views on God[edit] ****
Born a Catholic, Laplace appears in adult life to have inclined to deism
(presumably his considered position, since it is the only one found in his
writings). However, some of his contemporaries thought he was an atheist, while
a number of recent scholars have described him as agnostic.
Faye thought that Laplace "did not profess atheism",[78] but Napoleon, on Saint
Helena, told General Gaspard_Gourgaud, "I often asked Laplace what he thought
of God. He owned that he was an atheist."[84] Roger Hahn, in his biography of
Laplace, mentions a dinner party at which "the geologist Jean-Ãtienne_Guettard
was staggered by Laplace's bold denunciation of the existence of God". It
appeared to Guettard that Laplace's atheism "was supported by a thoroughgoing
materialism".[85] But the chemist Jean-Baptiste_Dumas, who knew Laplace well in
the 1820s, wrote that Laplace "provided materialists with their specious
arguments, without sharing their convictions".[86][87]
Hahn states: "Nowhere in his writings, either public or private, does Laplace
deny God's existence."[88] Expressions occur in his private letters that appear
inconsistent with atheism.[3] On 17 June 1809, for instance, he wrote to his
son, "Je prie Dieu qu'il veille sur tes jours. Aie-Le toujours prÃ©sent Ã  ta
pensÃ©e, ainsi que ton pÃ¨re et ta mÃ¨re [I pray that God watches over your
days. Let Him be always present to your mind, as also your father and your
mother]."[79][89] Ian S. Glass, quoting Herschel's account of the celebrated
exchange with Napoleon, writes that Laplace was "evidently a deist like
Herschel".[90]
In Exposition du systÃ¨me du monde, Laplace quotes Newton's assertion that "the
wondrous disposition of the Sun, the planets and the comets, can only be the
work of an all-powerful and intelligent Being".[91] This, says Laplace, is a
"thought in which he [Newton] would be even more confirmed, if he had known
what we have shown, namely that the conditions of the arrangement of the
planets and their satellites are precisely those which ensure its stability".
[92] By showing that the "remarkable" arrangement of the planets could be
entirely explained by the laws of motion, Laplace had eliminated the need for
the "supreme intelligence" to intervene, as Newton had "made" it do.[93]
Laplace cites with approval Leibniz's criticism of Newton's invocation of
divine intervention to restore order to the Solar System: "This is to have very
narrow ideas about the wisdom and the power of God."[94] He evidently shared
Leibniz's astonishment at Newton's belief "that God has made his machine so
badly that unless he affects it by some extraordinary means, the watch will
very soon cease to go".[95]
In a group of manuscripts, preserved in relative secrecy in a black envelope in
the library of the AcadÃ©mie des sciences and published for the first time by
Hahn, Laplace mounted a deist critique of Christianity. It is, he writes, the
"first and most infallible of principles ... to reject miraculous facts as
untrue".[96] As for the doctrine of transubstantiation, it "offends at the same
time reason, experience, the testimony of all our senses, the eternal laws of
nature, and the sublime ideas that we ought to form of the Supreme Being". It
is the sheerest absurdity to suppose that "the sovereign lawgiver of the
universe would suspend the laws that he has established, and which he seems to
have maintained invariably".[97]
In old age, Laplace remained curious about the question of God[98] and
frequently discussed Christianity with the Swiss astronomer Jean-FrÃ©dÃ©ric-
ThÃ©odore Maurice.[99] He told Maurice that "Christianity is quite a beautiful
thing" and praised its civilising influence. Maurice thought that the basis of
Laplace's beliefs was, little by little, being modified, but that he held fast
to his conviction that the invariability of the laws of nature did not permit
of supernatural events.[98] After Laplace's death, Poisson told Maurice, "You
know that I do not share your [religious] opinions, but my conscience forces me
to recount something that will surely please you." When Poisson had
complimented Laplace about his "brilliant discoveries", the dying man had fixed
him with a pensive look and replied, "Ah! we chase after phantoms [chimÃ¨res]."
[100] These were his last words, interpreted by Maurice as a realisation of the
ultimate "vanity" of earthly pursuits.[101] Laplace received the last_rites
from the curÃ© of the Missions ÃtrangÃ¨res (in whose parish he was to be
buried)[87] and the curÃ© of Arcueil.[101]
However, according to his biographer, Roger Hahn, it is "not credible" that
Laplace "had a proper Catholic end", and he "remained a skeptic" to the very
end of his life.[102] Laplace in his last years has been described as an
agnostic.[103][104][105]
**** Excommunication of a comet[edit] ****
In 1470 the humanist scholar Bartolomeo_Platina wrote[106] that Pope_Callixtus
III had asked for prayers for deliverance from the Turks during a 1456
appearance of Halley's_Comet. Platina's account does not accord with Church
records, which do not mention the comet. Laplace is alleged to have embellished
the story by claiming the Pope had "excommunicated" Halley's comet.[107] What
Laplace actually said, in Exposition du systÃ¨me du monde (1796), was that the
Pope had ordered the comet to be "exorcised" (conjurÃ©). It was Arago, in Des
ComÃ¨tes en gÃ©nÃ©ral (1832), who first spoke of an excommunication.[108][109]

      hypothÃ¨se-lÃ ", allegedly as a reply to Napoleon, who had asked why he
      hadn't mentioned God in his book on astronomy.)[9]
    * It is therefore obvious that ... (Frequently used in the Celestial
      Mechanics when he had proved something and mislaid the proof, or found it
      clumsy. Notorious as a signal for something true, but hard to prove.)
    * "We are so far from knowing all the agents of nature and their diverse
      modes of action that it would not be philosophical to deny phenomena
      solely because they are inexplicable in the actual state of our
      knowledge. But we ought to examine them with an attention all the more

      [117]
    * What we know is little, and what we are ignorant of is immense. (Fourier

      Scientist. Harvard University Press. p. 204. ISBN 978-0-674-01892-1. The
      Catholic newspaper La Quotidienne [The Daily] announced that Laplace had
      died in the arms of two curÃ©s (priests), implying that he had a proper
      Catholic end, but this is not credible. To the end, he remained a
      skeptic, wedded to his deterministic creed and to an uncompromised ethos
      derived from his vast scientific experience.

      Publicly, Laplace maintained his agnostic beliefs, and even in his old
      age continued to be skeptical about any function God might play in a
      deterministic universe.
