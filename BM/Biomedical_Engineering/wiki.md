Biomedical engineering (BME) or medical engineering is the application of
engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for
healthcare purposes (e.g. diagnostic or therapeutic). This field seeks to close
the gap between engineering and medicine, combining the design and problem
solving skills of engineering with medical biological sciences to advance
health care treatment, including diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy.[1][2] Also
included under the scope of a biomedical engineer is the management of current
medical equipment within hospitals while adhering to relevant industry
standards. This involves equipment recommendations, procurement, routine
testing and preventative maintenance, through to decommissioning and disposal.
This role is also known as a Biomedical_Equipment_Technician_(BMET) or clinical
engineering.
Biomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own study, as compared to
many other engineering fields. Such an evolution is common as a new field
transition from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-
established fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in
biomedical engineering consists of research_and_development, spanning a broad
array of subfields (see below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications
include the development of biocompatible prostheses, various diagnostic and
therapeutic medical_devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants,
common imaging equipment such as MRIs and EKG/ECGs, regenerative tissue growth,
pharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic biologicals.

***** Bioinformatics[edit] *****
Main article: Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software
tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of
science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and
engineering to analyze and interpret biological data.
Bioinformatics is considered both an umbrella term for the body of biological
studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as
a reference to specific analysis "pipelines" that are repeatedly used,
particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include
the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides (SNPs). Often, such
identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis
of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural
species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way,
bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within
nucleic acid and protein sequences.
***** Biomechanics[edit] *****
A ribosome is a biological_machine that utilizes protein_dynamics
Main article: Biomechanics
Biomechanics is the study of the structure and function of the mechanical
aspects of biological systems, at any level from whole organisms to organs,
cells and cell_organelles,[3] using the methods of mechanics.[4]
***** Biomaterial[edit] *****
Main article: Biomaterial
A biomaterial is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with living
systems. As a science, biomaterials is about fifty years old. The study of
biomaterials is called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering. It has
experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies
investing large amounts of money into the development of new products.
Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry,
tissue engineering and materials science.
***** Biomedical optics[edit] *****
Biomedical optics refers to the interaction of biological tissue and light, and
how this can be exploited for sensing, imaging, and treatment.[5]
***** Tissue engineering[edit] *****
Main article: Tissue_engineering
Tissue engineering, like genetic engineering (see below), is a major segment of
biotechnology â which overlaps significantly with BME.
One of the goals of tissue engineering is to create artificial organs (via
biological material) for patients that need organ transplants. Biomedical
engineers are currently researching methods of creating such organs.
Researchers have grown solid jawbones[6] and tracheas[7] from human stem cells
towards this end. Several artificial_urinary_bladders have been grown in
laboratories and transplanted successfully into human patients.[8]
Bioartificial organs, which use both synthetic and biological component, are
also a focus area in research, such as with hepatic assist devices that use
liver cells within an artificial bioreactor construct.[9]

***** Genetic engineering[edit] *****
Main article: Genetic_engineering
Genetic engineering, recombinant DNA technology, genetic modification/
manipulation (GM) and gene splicing are terms that apply to the direct
manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect
method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such
as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and
characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found
success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop
technology (not a medical application, but see biological_systems_engineering),
the manufacture of synthetic human insulin through the use of modified
bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the
production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer
mouse) for research.[citation_needed]
***** Neural engineering[edit] *****
Neural_engineering (also known as neuroengineering) is a discipline that uses
engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural
systems. Neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at
the interface of living neural tissue and non-living constructs.
***** Pharmaceutical engineering[edit] *****
Pharmaceutical_engineering is an interdisciplinary science that includes drug
engineering, novel drug delivery and targeting, pharmaceutical technology, unit
operations of Chemical_Engineering, and Pharmaceutical Analysis. It may be
deemed as a part of pharmacy due to its focus on the use of technology on
chemical agents in providing better medicinal treatment.
***** Medical devices[edit] *****
Main articles: Medical_devices, medical_equipment, and Medical_technology
This is an extremely broad categoryâessentially covering all health care
products that do not achieve their intended results through predominantly
chemical (e.g., pharmaceuticals) or biological (e.g., vaccines) means, and do
not involve metabolism.
A medical device is intended for use in:
    * the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or
    * in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
Some examples include pacemakers, infusion_pumps, the heart-lung_machine,
dialysis machines, artificial_organs, implants, artificial_limbs, corrective
lenses, cochlear_implants, ocular_prosthetics, facial_prosthetics, somato
prosthetics, and dental_implants.

Stereolithography is a practical example of medical modeling being used to
create physical objects. Beyond modeling organs and the human body, emerging
engineering techniques are also currently used in the research and development
of new devices for innovative therapies,[10] treatments,[11] patient
monitoring,[12] of complex diseases.
Medical devices are regulated and classified (in the US) as follows (see also
Regulation):
    * Class I devices present minimal potential for harm to the user and are
      often simpler in design than Class II or Class III devices. Devices in
      this category include tongue depressors, bedpans, elastic bandages,
      examination gloves, and hand-held surgical instruments and other similar
      types of common equipment.
    * Class II devices are subject to special controls in addition to the
      general controls of Class I devices. Special controls may include special
      labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, and postmarket
      surveillance. Devices in this class are typically non-invasive and
      include X-ray machines, PACS, powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps, and
      surgical drapes.
    * Class III devices generally require premarket approval (PMA) or premarket
      notification (510k), a scientific review to ensure the device's safety
      and effectiveness, in addition to the general controls of Class I.
      Examples include replacement heart valves, hip and knee joint implants,
      silicone gel-filled breast implants, implanted cerebellar stimulators,
      implantable pacemaker pulse generators and endosseous (intra-bone)
      implants.
**** Medical imaging[edit] ****
Main article: Medical_imaging
Medical/biomedical imaging is a major segment of medical_devices. This area
deals with enabling clinicians to directly or indirectly "view" things not
visible in plain sight (such as due to their size, and/or location). This can
involve utilizing ultrasound, magnetism, UV, radiology, and other means.

of electrical_engineering to diagnostic_imaging. Click_here to view an animated
sequence of slices.
Imaging technologies are often essential to medical diagnosis, and are
typically the most complex equipment found in a hospital including:
fluoroscopy, magnetic_resonance_imaging (MRI), nuclear_medicine, positron
emission_tomography (PET), PET-CT_scans, projection radiography such as X-rays
and CT_scans, tomography, ultrasound, optical_microscopy, and electron
microscopy.
**** Implants[edit] ****
An implant is a kind of medical device made to replace and act as a missing
biological structure (as compared with a transplant, which indicates
transplanted biomedical tissue). The surface of implants that contact the body
might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone or apatite
depending on what is the most functional. In some cases, implants contain
electronics, e.g. artificial pacemakers and cochlear implants. Some implants
are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of
implantable pills or drug-eluting_stents.

**** Bionics[edit] ****
Further information: Bionics_Â§ In_medicine
Artificial body part replacements are one of the many applications of bionics.
Concerned with the intricate and thorough study of the properties and function
of human body systems, bionics may be applied to solve some engineering
problems. Careful study of the different functions and processes of the eyes,
ears, and other organs paved the way for improved cameras, television, radio
transmitters and receivers, and many other useful tools. These developments
have indeed made our lives better, but the best contribution that bionics has
made is in the field of biomedical engineering (the building of useful
replacements for various parts of the human body). Modern hospitals now have
available spare parts to replace body parts badly damaged by injury or disease
[Citation Needed]. Biomedical engineers work hand in hand with doctors to build
these artificial body parts.
**** Biomedical Sensors[edit] ****
In recent years biomedical sensors based in microwave technology have gained
more attention. Different sensors can be manufactured for specific uses in both
diagnosing and monitoring disease conditions, for example microwave sensors can
be used as a complementary technique to X-ray to monitor lower extremity
trauma.[13] The sensor monitor the dielectric properties and can thus notice
change in tissue (bone, muscle, fat etc.) under the skin so when measuring at
different times during the healing process the response from the sensor will
change as the trauma heals.
***** Clinical engineering[edit] *****
Main article: Clinical_engineering
Clinical_engineering is the branch of biomedical engineering dealing with the
actual implementation of medical_equipment and technologies in hospitals or
other clinical settings. Major roles of clinical engineers include training and
supervising biomedical_equipment_technicians_(BMETs), selecting technological
products/services and logistically managing their implementation, working with
governmental regulators on inspections/audits, and serving as technological
consultants for other hospital staff (e.g. physicians, administrators, I.T.,
etc.). Clinical engineers also advise and collaborate with medical device
producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical
experiences, as well as monitor the progression of the state of the art so as
to redirect procurement patterns accordingly.
Their inherent focus on practical implementation of technology has tended to
keep them oriented more towards incremental-level redesigns and
reconfigurations, as opposed to revolutionary research & development or ideas
that would be many years from clinical adoption; however, there is a growing
effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence
the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a
"bridge" between the primary designers and the end-users, by combining the
perspectives of being both 1) close to the point-of-use, while 2) trained in
product and process engineering. Clinical engineering departments will
sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also industrial/systems
engineers to help address operations research/optimization, human factors, cost
analysis, etc. Also see safety_engineering for a discussion of the procedures
used to design safe systems. There are various companies that help biomedical
engineers to bring out their plans into action by making medical devices/
machines. Few of the top companies include GE, PHILIPS, SIEMENS, DRAGER, DRAQIL
etc.
***** Rehabilitation engineering[edit] *****
Main article: Rehabilitation_engineering
Rehabilitation engineering is the systematic application of engineering
sciences to design, develop, adapt, test, evaluate, apply, and distribute
technological solutions to problems confronted by individuals with
disabilities. Functional areas addressed through rehabilitation engineering may
include mobility, communications, hearing, vision, and cognition, and
activities associated with employment, independent living, education, and
integration into the community.[1]
While some rehabilitation engineers have master's degrees in rehabilitation
engineering, usually a subspecialty of Biomedical engineering, most
rehabilitation engineers have undergraduate or graduate degrees in biomedical
engineering, mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering. A Portuguese
university provides an undergraduate degree and a master's degree in
Rehabilitation Engineering and Accessibility.[6][8] Qualification to become a
Rehab' Engineer in the UK is possible via a University BSc Honours Degree
course such as Health Design & Technology Institute, Coventry University.[9]
The rehabilitation process for people with disabilities often entails the
design of assistive devices such as Walking aids intended to promote inclusion
of their users into the mainstream of society, commerce, and recreation.

Regulatory issues have been constantly increased in the last decades to respond
to the many incidents caused by devices to patients. For example, from 2008 to
2011, in US, there were 119 FDA recalls of medical devices classified as class
I. According to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Class_I_recall is
associated to "a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the
use of, or exposure to, a product will cause serious adverse health
consequences or death"[14]
Regardless of the country-specific legislation, the main regulatory objectives
coincide worldwide.[15] For example, in the medical device regulations, a
product must be: 1) safe and 2) effective and 3) for all the manufactured
devices
A product is safe if patients, users and third parties do not run unacceptable
risks of physical hazards (death, injuries, â¦) in its intended use.
Protective measures have to be introduced on the devices to reduce residual
risks at acceptable level if compared with the benefit derived from the use of
it.
A product is effective if it performs as specified by the manufacturer in the
intended use. Effectiveness is achieved through clinical evaluation, compliance
to performance standards or demonstrations of substantial equivalence with an
already marketed device.
The previous features have to be ensured for all the manufactured items of the
medical device. This requires that a quality system shall be in place for all
the relevant entities and processes that may impact safety and effectiveness
over the whole medical device lifecycle.
The medical device engineering area is among the most heavily regulated fields
of engineering, and practicing biomedical engineers must routinely consult and
cooperate with regulatory law attorneys and other experts. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) is the principal healthcare regulatory authority in the
United States, having jurisdiction over medical devices, drugs, biologics, and
combination products. The paramount objectives driving policy decisions by the
FDA are safety and effectiveness of healthcare products that have to be assured
through a quality system in place as specified under 21_CFR_829_regulation. In
addition, because biomedical engineers often develop devices and technologies
for "consumer" use, such as physical therapy devices (which are also "medical"
devices), these may also be governed in some respects by the Consumer_Product
Safety_Commission. The greatest hurdles tend to be 510K "clearance" (typically
for Class 2 devices) or pre-market "approval" (typically for drugs and class 3
devices).
In the European context, safety effectiveness and quality is ensured through
the "Conformity Assessment" that is defined as "the method by which a
manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies with the requirements of the
European Medical_Device_Directive". The directive specifies different
procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple
Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification
(Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance
(Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive
specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these
procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific
deliveries such as the risk management file, the technical file and the quality
system deliveries. The risk management file is the first deliverable that
conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage
shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable
level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients for the use of the
device. The technical_file contains all the documentation data and records
supporting medical device certification. FDA technical file has similar content
although organized in different structure. The Quality System deliverables
usually includes procedures that ensure quality throughout all product life
cycle. The same standard (ISO EN 13485) is usually applied for quality
management systems in US and worldwide.
Implants, such as artificial_hip joints, are generally extensively regulated
due to the invasive nature of such devices.
In the European Union, there are certifying entities named "Notified_Bodies",
accredited by European Member States. The Notified Bodies must ensure the
effectiveness of the certification process for all medical devices apart from
the class I devices where a declaration of conformity produced by the
manufacturer is sufficient for marketing. Once a product has passed all the
steps required by the Medical Device Directive, the device is entitled to bear
a CE_marking, indicating that the device is believed to be safe and effective
when used as intended, and, therefore, it can be marketed within the European
Union area.
The different regulatory arrangements sometimes result in particular
technologies being developed first for either the U.S. or in Europe depending
on the more favorable form of regulation. While nations often strive for
substantive harmony to facilitate cross-national distribution, philosophical
differences about the optimal extent of regulation can be a hindrance; more
restrictive regulations seem appealing on an intuitive level, but critics decry
the tradeoff cost in terms of slowing access to life-saving developments.
**** RoHS II[edit] ****
Directive 2011/65/EU, better known as RoHS 2 is a recast of legislation
originally introduced in 2002. The original EU legislation "Restrictions of
Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronics Devices" (RoHS
Directive 2002/95/EC) was replaced and superseded by 2011/65/EU published in
July 2011 and commonly known as RoHS 2. RoHS seeks to limit the dangerous
substances in circulation in electronics products, in particular toxins and
heavy metals, which are subsequently released into the environment when such
devices are recycled.
The scope of RoHS 2 is widened to include products previously excluded, such as
medical devices and industrial equipment. In addition, manufacturers are now
obliged to provide conformity risk assessments and test reports â or explain
why they are lacking. For the first time, not only manufacturers, but also
importers and distributors share a responsibility to ensure Electrical and
Electronic Equipment within the scope of RoHS comply with the hazardous
substances limits and have a CE mark on their products.
**** IEC 60601[edit] ****
The new International Standard IEC_60601 for home healthcare electro-medical
devices defining the requirements for devices used in the home healthcare
environment. IEC 60601-1-11 (2010) must now be incorporated into the design and
verification of a wide range of home use and point of care medical devices
along with other applicable standards in the IEC 60601 3rd edition series.
The mandatory date for implementation of the EN European version of the
standard is June 1, 2013. The US FDA requires the use of the standard on June
30, 2013, while Health Canada recently extended the required date from June
2012 to April 2013. The North American agencies will only require these
standards for new device submissions, while the EU will take the more severe
approach of requiring all applicable devices being placed on the market to
consider the home healthcare standard.
**** AS/NZS 3551:2012[edit] ****
AS/ANS_3551:2012 is the Australian and New Zealand standards for the management
of medical devices. The standard specifies the procedures required to maintain
a wide range of medical assets in a clinical setting (e.g. Hospital).[16] The
standards are based on the IEC 606101 standards.
The standard covers a wide range of medical equipment management elements
including, procurement, acceptance testing, maintenance (electrical safety and
preventative maintenance testing) and decommissioning.
***** Training and certification[edit] *****
**** Education[edit] ****
Biomedical engineers require considerable knowledge of both engineering and
biology, and typically have a Bachelor's (B.Tech., B.S.) or Master's (M.S.,
M.Tech., M.S.E., or M.Eng.) or a doctoral (Ph.D.) degree in BME (Biomedical
Engineering) or another branch of engineering with considerable potential for
BME overlap. As interest in BME increases, many engineering colleges now have a
Biomedical Engineering Department or Program, with offerings ranging from the
undergraduate (B.Tech., B.S., B.Eng. or B.S.E.) to doctoral levels. Biomedical
engineering has only recently been emerging as its own discipline rather than a
cross-disciplinary hybrid specialization of other disciplines; and BME programs
at all levels are becoming more widespread, including the Bachelor_of_Science
in_Biomedical_Engineering which actually includes so much biological science
content that many students use it as a "pre-med" major in preparation for
medical_school. The number of biomedical engineers is expected to rise as both
a cause and effect of improvements in medical technology.[17]
In the U.S., an increasing number of undergraduate programs are also becoming
recognized by ABET as accredited bioengineering/biomedical engineering
programs. Over 65 programs are currently accredited by ABET.[18][19]
In Canada and Australia, accredited graduate programs in biomedical engineering
are common, for example in universities such as McMaster_University, and the
first Canadian undergraduate BME program at Ryerson_University offering a four-
year B.Eng. program.[20][21][22][23] The Polytechnique in Montreal is also
offering a bachelors's degree in biomedical engineering.
As with many degrees, the reputation and ranking of a program may factor into
the desirability of a degree holder for either employment or graduate
admission. The reputation of many undergraduate degrees are also linked to the
institution's graduate or research programs, which have some tangible factors
for rating, such as research funding and volume, publications and citations.
With BME specifically, the ranking of a university's hospital and medical
school can also be a significant factor in the perceived prestige of its BME
department/program.
Graduate_education is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many
engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need
graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the
majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them.[24] Since most BME-
related professions involve scientific research, such as in pharmaceutical and
medical_device development, graduate education is almost a requirement (as
undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and
experience). This can be either a Masters or Doctoral level degree; while in
certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly
ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived need for some
kind of graduate credential is so strong that some undergraduate BME programs
will actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed
intention to also obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school
afterwards.
Graduate programs in BME, like in other scientific fields, are highly varied,
and particular programs may emphasize certain aspects within the field. They
may also feature extensive collaborative efforts with programs in other fields
(such as the University's Medical School or other engineering divisions), owing
again to the interdisciplinary nature of BME. M.S. and Ph.D. programs will
typically require applicants to have an undergraduate degree in BME, or another
engineering discipline (plus certain life science coursework), or life science
(plus certain engineering coursework).
Education in BME also varies greatly around the world. By virtue of its
extensive biotechnology sector, its numerous major universities, and relatively
few internal barriers, the U.S. has progressed a great deal in its development
of BME education and training opportunities. Europe, which also has a large
biotechnology sector and an impressive education system, has encountered
trouble in creating uniform standards as the European community attempts to
supplant some of the national jurisdictional barriers that still exist.
Recently, initiatives such as BIOMEDEA have sprung up to develop BME-related
education and professional standards.[25] Other countries, such as Australia,
are recognizing and moving to correct deficiencies in their BME education.[26]
Also, as high technology endeavors are usually marks of developed nations, some
areas of the world are prone to slower development in education, including in
BME.
**** Licensure/certification[edit] ****
See also: Professional_engineer
As with other learned professions, each state has certain (fairly similar)
requirements for becoming licensed as a registered Professional_Engineer (PE),
but, in US, in industry such a license is not required to be an employee as an
engineer in the majority of situations (due to an exception known as the
industrial exemption, which effectively applies to the vast majority of
American engineers). The US model has generally been only to require the
practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public
welfare, safety, safeguarding of life, health, or property to be licensed,
while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of
engineering services to the public or other businesses, education, and
government need not be licensed. This is notably not the case in many other
countries, where a license is as legally necessary to practice engineering as
it is for law or medicine.
Biomedical engineering is regulated in some countries, such as Australia, but
registration is typically only recommended and not required.[27]
In the UK, mechanical engineers working in the areas of Medical Engineering,
Bioengineering or Biomedical engineering can gain Chartered_Engineer status
through the Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers. The Institution also runs the
Engineering in Medicine and Health Division.[28] The Institute of Physics and
Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) has a panel for the accreditation of MSc courses
in Biomedical Engineering and Chartered Engineering status can also be sought
through IPEM.
The Fundamentals_of_Engineering_exam â the first (and more general) of two
licensure examinations for most U.S. jurisdictionsâdoes now cover biology
(although technically not BME). For the second exam, called the Principles and
Practices, Part 2, or the Professional Engineering exam, candidates may select
a particular engineering discipline's content to be tested on; there is
currently not an option for BME with this, meaning that any biomedical
engineers seeking a license must prepare to take this examination in another
category (which does not affect the actual license, since most jurisdictions do
not recognize discipline specialties anyway). However, the Biomedical
Engineering Society (BMES) is, as of 2009, exploring the possibility of seeking
to implement a BME-specific version of this exam to facilitate biomedical
engineers pursuing licensure.
Beyond governmental registration, certain private-sector professional/
industrial organizations also offer certifications with varying degrees of
prominence. One such example is the Certified Clinical Engineer (CCE)
certification for Clinical engineers.
***** Career prospects[edit] *****
In 2012 there were about 19,400 biomedical engineers employed in the US, and
the field was predicted to grow by 27% (much faster than average) from 2012 to
2022.[29] Biomedical engineering has the highest percentage of women engineers
compared to other common engineering professions.
