The integumentary system comprises the skin and its appendages acting to
protect the body from various kinds of damage, such as loss of water or damages
from outside. The integumentary system includes hair, scales, feathers, hooves,
and nails. It has a variety of additional functions; it may serve to
waterproof, and protect the deeper tissues, excrete wastes, and regulate body
temperature, and is the attachment site for sensory_receptors to detect pain,
sensation, pressure, and temperature. In most land vertebrates with significant
exposure to sunlight, the integumentary system also provides for vitamin_D
synthesis.

***** Skin[edit] *****
The skin is the largest organ of the body. In humans, it accounts for about 12
to 15 percent of total body weight and covers 1.5-2m2 of surface area.[1]
The human_skin (integument) is composed of at least two major layers of tissue:
the epidermis and dermis. (The hypodermis or subcutaneous layer is not part of
the skin[citation_needed].) The epidermis is the outermost layer, providing the
initial barrier to the external environment.It is separated from the dermis by
the basement membrane. The epidermis contains melanocytes and gives color to
the skin. The deepest layer of epidermis also contains nerve endings. Beneath
this, the dermis comprises two sections, the papillary and reticular layers,
and contains connective tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair roots,
sensory nerve endings, and muscular tissue.[2] The deepest layer, the
hypodermis, is primarily made up of adipose_tissue. Substantial collagen
bundles anchor the dermis to the hypodermis in a way that permits most areas of
the skin to move freely over the deeper tissue layers.[3]
**** Epidermis[edit] ****
Main article: Epidermis_(skin)
Epidermis and dermis of human skin
The epidermis is the top layer of skin made up of epithelial_cells. It does not
contain blood vessels. Its main functions are protection, absorption of
nutrients, and homeostasis. In structure, it consists of a keratinized
stratified squamous_epithelium; four types of cells: keratinocytes,
melanocytes, Merkel_cells, and Langerhans_cells. The major cell of the
epidermis is the keratinocyte, which produces keratin, a fibrous protein that
aids in skin protection. An overwhelming amount of keratin can cause disease by
giving rise to eruptions from the skin that will protrude outwards and lead to
infection.[citation_needed] Keratin is also a waterproofing protein. Millions
of dead keratinocytes rub off daily. The majority of the skin on the body is
keratinized. The only skin on the body that is non-keratinized is the lining of
mucous membranes, such as the inside of the mouth. Non-keratinized cells allow
water to "stay" atop the structure.
The protein keratin stiffens epidermal tissue to form fingernails. Nails grow
from a thin area called the nail_matrix at an average of 1 mm per week. The
lunula is the crescent-shape area at the base of the nail, lighter in color as
it mixes with the matrix cells. Also, the stratum corneum is the top part of
the epidermis.
**** Dermis[edit] ****
Main article: Dermis
The dermis is the middle layer of skin, composed of dense irregular connective
tissue and areolar_connective_tissue such as a collagen with elastin arranged
in a diffusely bundled and woven pattern. The dermis has two layers. One is the
papillary layer which is the superficial layer and consists of the areolar
connective tissue. The other is the reticular layer which is the deep layer of
the dermis and consists of the dense irregular connective tissue. These layers
serve to give elasticity to the integument, allowing stretching and conferring
flexibility, while also resisting distortions, wrinkling, and sagging.[2] The
dermal layer provides a site for the endings of blood vessels and nerves. Many
chromatophores are also stored in this layer, as are the bases of integumental
structures such as hair, feathers, and glands.
***** Hypodermis[edit] *****
Main article: Hypodermis
The hypodermis, otherwise known as the subcutaneous layer, is a layer beneath
the skin. It invaginates into the dermis and is attached to the latter,
immediately above it, by collagen and elastin fibres. It is essentially
composed of a type of cell known as adipocytes specialised in accumulating and
storing fats. These cells are grouped together in lobules separated by
connective tissue.
The hypodermis acts as an energy reserve. The fats contained in the adipocytes
can be put back into circulation, via the venous route, during intense effort
or when there is a lack of energy providing substances, and are then
transformed into energy. The hypodermis participates, passively at least, in
thermoregulation since fat is a heat insulator.
***** Functions[edit] *****
The integumentary system has multiple roles in homeostasis. All body systems
work in an interconnected manner to maintain the internal conditions essential
to the function of the body. The skin has an important job of protecting the
body and acts as the bodyâs first line of defense against infection,
temperature change, and other challenges to homeostasis. Functions include:
    * Protect the bodyâs internal living tissues and organs
    * Protect against invasion by infectious organisms
    * Protect the body from dehydration
    * Protect the body against abrupt_changes in temperature, maintain
      homeostasis
    * Help excrete waste materials through perspiration
    * Act as a receptor for touch, pressure, pain, heat, and cold (see
      Somatosensory_system)
    * Protect the body against sunburns by secreting melanin
    * Generate vitamin_D through exposure to ultraviolet light
    * Store water, fat, glucose, vitamin D
    * Maintenance of the body form
    * Formation of new cells from stratum germanium to repair minor injuries
    * Protect from UV rays.
    * Regulates body temperature
It distinguishes, separates, and protects the organism from its surroundings.
Small-bodied invertebrates of aquatic or continually moist habitats respire
using the outer layer (integument). This gas exchange system, where gases
simply diffuse into and out of the interstitial_fluid, is called integumentary
exchange.
