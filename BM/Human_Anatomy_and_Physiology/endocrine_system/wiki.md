The endocrine system is a chemical messenger system comprising feedback loops
of hormones released by internal glands of an organism directly into the
circulatory_system, regulating distant target organs. In humans, the major
endocrine_glands are the thyroid_gland and the adrenal_glands. In vertebrates,
the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The
study of the endocrine system and its disorders is known as endocrinology.
Endocrinology is a branch of internal_medicine.[1]
A number of glands that signal each other in sequence are usually referred to
as an axis, for example, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis. In addition
to the specialized endocrine organs mentioned above, many other organs that are
part of other body systems, including bone, kidney, liver, heart and gonads,
have secondary endocrine functions. For example, the kidney secretes endocrine
hormones such as erythropoietin and renin. Hormones can consist of either amino
acid complexes, steroids, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, or prostaglandins.[1]
The endocrine system can be contrasted to both exocrine_glands, which secrete
hormones to the outside of the body using ducts and paracrine_signalling
between cells over a relatively short distance. Endocrince glands have no
ducts, are vascular and commonly have intracellular vacuoles or granules that
store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine_glands, such as salivary_glands,
sweat_glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal_tract, tend to be much
less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.
The word endocrine derives via New_Latin from the Greek words á¼Î½Î´Î¿Î½,
endon, "inside, within," and "crine"_from_the_ÎºÏÎ¯Î½Ï, krÄ«nÅ, "to
separate, distinguish".

***** Structure[edit] *****
**** Major endocrine systems[edit] ****
The human endocrine system consists of several systems that operate via
feedback_loops. Several important feedback systems are mediated via the
hypothalamus and pituitary.[2]
    * TRH_â_TSH_â_T3/T4
    * GnRH_â_LH/FSH_â_sex_hormones
    * CRH_â_ACTH_â_cortisol
    * Renin_â_angiotensin_â_aldosterone
    * leptin_vs._insulin
**** Glands[edit] ****
Main article: Endocrine_gland
Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their
products, hormones, directly into interstitial spaces and then absorbed into
blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system
include the pineal_gland, pituitary_gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid
gland, parathyroid_gland, hypothalamus and adrenal_glands. The hypothalamus and
pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs.
**** Cells[edit] ****
There are many types of cells that comprise the endocrine system and these
cells typically make up larger tissues and organs that function within and
outside of the endocrine system.
    * Hypothalamus
    * Anterior_pituitary_gland
    * Pineal_gland
    * Posterior_pituitary_gland
    * Thyroid_gland
          o Follicular_cells of the thyroid gland produce and secrete T3 and T4
            in response to elevated levels of TRH, produced by the
            hypothalamus, and subsequent elevated levels of TSH, produced by
            the anterior_pituitary_gland, which further regulates the metabolic
            activity and rate of all cells, including cell_growth and tissue
            differentiation.
    * Parathyroid_gland
          o Epithelial cells of the parathyroid glands are richly supplied with
            blood from the inferior and superior_thyroid_arteries and secrete
            parathyroid_hormone (PTH). PTH acts on bone, the kidneys, and the
            GI_tract to increase calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion.
            In addition, PTH stimulates the conversion of Vitamin_D to its most
            active variant, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin_D3, which further stimulates
            calcium absorption in the GI tract.[1]

**** Hormones[edit] ****
Main article: Hormone
A hormone is any of a class of signaling_molecules produced by glands in
multicellular_organisms that are transported by the circulatory_system to
target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have
diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and
amino_acid/protein derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands
that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine system. The term hormone is
sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same
cell (autocrine or intracrine_signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine
signalling).
Hormones are used to communicate between organs and tissues for physiological
regulation and behavioral activities, such as digestion, metabolism,
respiration, tissue function, sensory_perception, sleep, excretion, lactation,
stress, growth_and_development, movement, reproduction, and mood.[3][4]
Hormones affect distant cells by binding to specific receptor proteins in the
target cell resulting in a change in cell function. This may lead to cell type-
specific responses that include rapid changes to the activity of existing
proteins, or slower changes in the expression of target genes. Amino
acidâbased hormones (amines and peptide_or_protein_hormones) are water-
soluble and act on the surface of target cells via signal_transduction
pathways; steroid_hormones, being lipid-soluble, move through the plasma
membranes of target cells to act within their nuclei.
**** Cell signalling[edit] ****
The typical mode of cell_signalling in the endocrine system is endocrine
signaling, that is, using the circulatory system to reach distant target
organs. However, there are also other modes, i.e., paracrine, autocrine, and
neuroendocrine signaling. Purely neurocrine signaling between neurons, on the
other hand, belongs completely to the nervous_system.
*** Autocrine[edit] ***
Main article: Autocrine_signalling
Autocrine signaling is a form of signaling in which a cell secretes a hormone
or chemical messenger (called the autocrine agent) that binds to autocrine
receptors on the same cell, leading to changes in the cells.
*** Paracrine[edit] ***
Main article: Paracrine_signalling
Some endocrinologists and clinicians include the paracrine system as part of
the endocrine system, but there is not consensus. Paracrines are slower acting,
targeting cells in the same tissue or organ. An example of this is somatostatin
which is released by some pancreatic cells and targets other pancreatic cells.
[1]
*** Juxtacrine[edit] ***
Main article: Juxtacrine_signalling
Juxtacrine signaling is a type of intercellular communication that is
transmitted via oligosaccharide, lipid, or protein components of a cell
membrane, and may affect either the emitting cell or the immediately adjacent
cells.[5]
It occurs between adjacent cells that possess broad patches of closely opposed
plasma membrane linked by transmembrane channels known as connexons. The gap
between the cells can usually be between only 2 and 4 nm.[6]

Main article: Endocrine_diseases
Diseases_of_the_endocrine_system are common,[8] including conditions such as
diabetes_mellitus, thyroid disease, and obesity. Endocrine disease is
characterized by misregulated hormone release (a productive pituitary_adenoma),
inappropriate response to signaling (hypothyroidism), lack of a gland (diabetes
mellitus_type_1, diminished erythropoiesis in chronic_renal_failure), or
structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid (toxic
multinodular_goitre). Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of
loss of reserve, hyposecretion, agenesis, atrophy, or active destruction.
Hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion, loss of suppression,
hyperplastic or neoplastic change, or hyperstimulation.
Endocrinopathies are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary
endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands. Secondary endocrine
disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland. Tertiary endocrine
disease is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamus and its releasing
hormones.[9]
As the thyroid, and hormones have been implicated in signaling distant tissues
to proliferate, for example, the estrogen_receptor has been shown to be
involved in certain breast_cancers. Endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine
signaling have all been implicated in proliferation, one of the required steps
of oncogenesis.[10]
Other common diseases that result from endocrine dysfunction include Addison's
disease, Cushing's_disease and Graves'_disease. Cushing's disease and Addison's
disease are pathologies involving the dysfunction of the adrenal gland.
Dysfunction in the adrenal gland could be due to primary or secondary factors
and can result in hypercortisolism or hypocortisolism . Cushing's disease is
characterized by the hypersecretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
due to a pituitary adenoma that ultimately causes endogenous hypercortisolism
by stimulating the adrenal glands.[11] Some clinical signs of Cushing's disease
include obesity, moon face, and hirsutism.[12] Addison's disease is an
endocrine disease that results from hypocortisolism caused by adrenal gland
insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is significant because it is correlated
with decreased ability to maintain blood pressure and blood sugar, a defect
that can prove to be fatal.[13]
Graves' disease involves the hyperactivity of the thyroid gland which produces
the T3 and T4 hormones.[12] Graves'_disease effects range from excess sweating,
fatigue, heat intolerance and high_blood_pressure to swelling of the eyes that
causes redness, puffiness and in rare cases reduced or double vision.[6]
***** Other animals[edit] *****
A neuroendocrine system has been observed in all animals with a nervous system
and all vertebrates have an hypothalamus-pituitary axis.[14] All vertebrates
have a thyroid, which in amphibians is also crucial for transformation of
larvae into adult form.[15][16] All vertebrates have adrenal gland tissue, with
mammals unique in having it organized into layers.[17] All vertebrates have
some form of a reninâangiotensin axis, and all tetrapods have aldosterone as
a primary mineralocorticoid.[18][19]
