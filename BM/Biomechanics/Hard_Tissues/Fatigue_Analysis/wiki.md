In materials_science, fatigue is the weakening of a material caused by cyclic
loading that results in progressive and localized structural damage and the
growth of cracks. Once a crack has initiated, each loading cycle will grow the
crack a small amount, typically producing striations on some parts of the
fracture surface. The crack will continue to grow until it reaches a critical
size which occurs when the stress_intensity_factor of the crack exceeds the
fracture_toughness of the material producing rapid propagation and typically
complete fracture of the structure.
Fatigue has traditionally been associated with the failure of metal components
which lead to the term metal fatigue. Early in the history of fatigue, the
sudden failing of metal railway axles was thought to be caused by the metal
crystallising because of the brittle appearance of the fracture surface, but
this has since been disproved.[1] Most materials seem to experience some sort
of fatigue-related failure such as composites, plastics and ceramics.[2]
To aid in predicting the fatigue life of a component, fatigue_tests are carried
out using coupons to measure the rate of crack growth by applying constant
amplitude cyclic loading and averaging the measured growth of a crack over
thousands of cycles. However, in order to predict the fatigue life of a
component, there are a number of special cases that need to be considered where
the rate of crack growth obtained from these tests needs adjustment. Such as:
the reduced rate of growth that occurs for small loads near the threshold or
after the application of an overload; and the increased rate of crack growth
associated with short cracks or after the application of an underload.[2]
If the loads are above a certain threshold, microscopic cracks will begin to
initiate at stress_concentrations such as holes, persistent slip bands (PSBs),
composite interfaces or grain_boundaries in metals.[3] The nominal maximum
stress values that cause such damage may be much less than the strength of the
material, typically quoted as the ultimate_tensile_stress_limit, or the yield
stress_limit.

***** Stages of fatigue[edit] *****
Fatigue failures, both for high and low cycle, all follow the same basic steps
process of crack initiation, stage I crack growth, stage II crack growth, and
finally ultimate failure. To begin the process cracks must nucleate within a
material. This process can occur either at stress_risers in metallic samples or
at areas with a high void density in polymer samples. These cracks propagate
slowly at first during stage I crack growth along crystallographic planes,
where shear stresses are highest. Once the cracks reach a critical size they
propagate quickly during stage II crack growth in a direction perpendicular to
the applied force. These cracks can eventually lead to the ultimate failure of
the material, often in a brittle catastrophic fashion.
**** Crack initiation[edit] ****
The formation of initial cracks preceding fatigue failure is a separate process
consisting of four discrete steps in metallic samples. The material will
develop cell structures and harden in response to the applied load. This causes
the amplitude of the applied stress to increase given the new restraints on
strain. These newly formed cell structures will eventually break down with the
formation of persistent slip bands (PSBs). Slip in the material is localized at
these PSBs, and the exaggerated slip can now serve as a stress concentrator for
a crack to form. Nucleation of a crack to a detectable size accounts for most
of the cracking process. It is for this reason that cyclic fatigue failures
seem to occur so suddenly- the bulk of the changes in the material are not
visible without destructive testing. Even in normally ductile materials,
fatigue failures will resemble sudden brittle failures.
PSB-induced slip planes result in intrusions and extrusions along the surface
of a material, often occurring in pairs.[4] This slip is not a microstructural
change within the material, but rather a propagation of dislocations within the
material. Instead of a smooth interface, the intrusions and extrusions will
cause the surface of the material to resemble the edge of a deck of cards,
where not all cards are perfectly aligned. Slip-induced intrusions and
extrusions create extremely fine surface structures on the material. With
surface structure size inversely related to stress concentration factors, PSB-
induced surface slip quickly becomes a perfect place for fractures to initiate.
These steps can be bypassed entirely if the cracks form at a preexisting stress
concentrator either from an inclusion in the material or from a geometric
stress concentrator such as a sharp corner or small radius. Forming a PSB
before failure requires more energy than crack initiation at a preexisting
stress concentrator. It is for that reason that part design and material
quality must be scrutinized when producing parts that will be subjected to high
cycle loading.
**** Crack growth[edit] ****
Fatigue cracks grow from material or manufacturing defects from as small as 10
Î¼m. In the case of aluminium, cracks generally grow from the surface, where
water vapour from the atmosphere is able to reach the tip of the crack and
dissociate into atomic hydrogen which causes hydrogen_embrittlement. Cracks
growing internally are isolated from the atmosphere and grow in a vacuum where
the rate of growth is typically an order of magnitude slower than a surface
crack.[5]
When the rate of growth becomes large enough, fatigue_striations can be seen on
the fracture surface. Striations mark the position of the crack tip and the
width of each striation represents the growth from one loading cycle.
Striations are a result of plasticity at the crack tip.
An estimate of the fatigue life of a component can be made using a crack_growth
equation by summing up the width of each increment of crack growth for each
loading cycle. Most of the fatigue life is generally consumed in the crack
growth phase. Safety or scatter factors are applied to the calculated life to
account for any uncertainty and variability associated with fatigue. When the
stress intensity exceeds a critical value known as the fracture toughness,
unsustainable fracture will occur, usually by a process of micro-void
coalescence. Prior to final fracture, the fracture surface may contain a
mixture of fatigue and fast fracture.
The rate of growth used in crack growth predictions is typically measured by
applying thousands of constant amplitude cycles to a coupon and measuring the
rate of growth from the change in compliance of the coupon or by measuring the
growth of the crack on the surface of the coupon. Standard methods for
measuring the rate of growth have been developed by ASTM International.[6]
The growth rate     d a  /  d N   {\displaystyle da/dN}  [{\displaystyle da/
dN}], is measured over a range of     &#x0394; K   {\displaystyle \Delta K}
[\Delta K], although additional variables such as mean stress, environment,
overloads and underloads can also affect the rate of growth. Crack growth may
stop below a certain threshold.
***** Characteristics of fatigue[edit] *****
Fracture of an aluminium crank arm. Dark area of striations: slow crack growth.
Bright granular area: sudden fracture.
    * In metal alloys, and for the simplifying case when there are no
      macroscopic or microscopic discontinuities, the process starts with
      dislocation movements at the microscopic level, which eventually form
      persistent slip bands that become the nucleus of short cracks.
    * Macroscopic and microscopic discontinuities (at the crystalline grain
      scale) as well as component design features which cause stress
      concentrations (holes, keyways, sharp changes of load direction etc.) are
      common locations at which the fatigue process begins.
    * Fatigue is a process that has a degree of randomness (stochastic), often
      showing considerable scatter even in seemingly identical samples in well
      controlled environments.
    * Fatigue is usually associated with tensile stresses but fatigue cracks
      have been reported due to compressive loads.[7]
    * The greater the applied stress range, the shorter the life.
    * Fatigue life scatter tends to increase for longer fatigue lives.
    * Damage is irreversible. Materials do not recover when rested.
    * Fatigue life is influenced by a variety of factors, such as temperature,
      surface_finish, metallurgical microstructure, presence of oxidizing or
      inert chemicals, residual_stresses, scuffing contact (fretting), etc.
    * Some materials (e.g., some steel and titanium alloys) exhibit a
      theoretical fatigue_limit below which continued loading does not lead to
      fatigue failure.
    * High cycle fatigue_strength (about 104 to 108 cycles) can be described by
      stress-based parameters. A load-controlled servo-hydraulic test rig is
      commonly used in these tests, with frequencies of around 20–50 Hz. Other
      sorts of machines—like resonant magnetic machines—can also be used, to
      achieve frequencies up to 250 Hz.
    * Low-cycle_fatigue (loading that typically causes failure in less than 104
      cycles) is associated with localized plastic behavior in metals; thus, a
      strain-based parameter should be used for fatigue life prediction in
      metals. Testing is conducted with constant strain amplitudes typically at
      0.01–5 Hz.

    * 1973: M. W. Brown and K. J. Miller observe that fatigue life under
      multiaxial conditions is governed by the experience of the plane
      receiving the most damage, and that both tension and shear loads on the
      critical_plane must be considered.[19]
***** Predicting fatigue life[edit] *****
The American_Society_for_Testing_and_Materials defines fatigue life, Nf, as the
number of stress cycles of a specified character that a specimen sustains
before failure of a specified nature occurs.[20] For some materials, notably
steel and titanium, there is a theoretical value for stress amplitude below
which the material will not fail for any number of cycles, called a fatigue
limit,_endurance_limit,_or_fatigue_strength.[21]
Engineers have used a number of methods to determine the fatigue life of a
material: [22]
   1. the stress-life method,
   2. the strain-life method,
   3. the crack growth method and
   4. probabilistic methods, which can be based on either life or crack growth
      methods.
Historically, fatigue has been separated in two regions of high cycle fatigue
that require more than 104 cycles to failure where stress is low and primarily
elastic and low_cycle_fatigue where there is significant plasticity.
Experiments have shown that low cycle fatigue is also crack growth.[23]
Whether using stress/strain-life approach or using crack growth approach,
complex or variable amplitude loading is reduced to a series of fatigue
equivalent simple cyclic loadings using a technique such as rainflow_analysis.
Spectrum loading
**** Stress/Strain-life methods[edit] ****
A mechanical part is often exposed to a complex, often random, sequence of
loads, large and small. In order to assess the safe life of such a part using
the fatigue damage or stress/strain-life methods the following series of steps
is usually performed:
   1. Complex loading is reduced to a series of simple cyclic loadings using a
      technique such as rainflow_analysis;
   2. A histogram of cyclic stress is created from the rainflow analysis to
      form a fatigue_damage_spectrum;
   3. For each stress level, the degree of cumulative damage is calculated from
      the S-N curve; and
   4. The effect of the individual contributions are combined using an
      algorithm such as Miner's rule.
Since S-N curves are typically generated for uniaxial loading and therefore
some equivalence rule is needed whenever the loading is multiaxial. For simple,
proportional loading histories (lateral load in a constant ratio with the
axial), Sines_rule may be applied. For more complex situations, such as non-
proportional loading, critical_plane_analysis must be applied.
*** Miner's rule[edit] ***
In 1945, M. A. Miner popularised a rule that had first been proposed by A.
Palmgren in 1924.[13] The rule, variously called Miner's rule or the Palmgren-
Miner linear damage hypothesis, states that where there are k different stress
magnitudes in a spectrum, Si (1 â¤ i â¤ k), each contributing ni(Si) cycles,
then if Ni(Si) is the number of cycles to failure of a constant stress reversal
Si (determined by uni-axial fatigue tests), failure occurs when:
          &#x2211;  i = 1   k      n  i    N  i     = C   {\displaystyle \sum _
      {i=1}^{k}{\frac {n_{i}}{N_{i}}}=C}  [{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{k}{\frac
      {n_{i}}{N_{i}}}=C}]
Usually, for design purposes, C is assumed to be 1. This can be thought of as
assessing what proportion of life is consumed by a linear combination of stress
reversals at varying magnitudes.
Although Miner's rule may be a useful approximation in many circumstances, it
has several major limitations:
   1. It fails to recognize the probabilistic nature of fatigue and there is no
      simple way to relate life predicted by the rule with the characteristics
      of a probability distribution. Industry analysts often use design curves,
      adjusted to account for scatter, to calculate Ni(Si).
   2. The sequence in which high vs. low stress cycles are applied to a sample
      in fact affect the fatigue life, for which Miner's Rule does not account.
      In some circumstances, cycles of low stress followed by high stress cause
      more damage than would be predicted by the rule.[24] It does not consider
      the effect of an overload or high stress which may result in a
      compressive residual stress that may retard crack growth. High stress
      followed by low stress may have less damage due to the presence of
      compressive residual stress.
*** Stress-life (S-N) method[edit] ***
In high-cycle fatigue situations, materials performance is commonly
characterized by an S-N curve, also known as a WÃ¶hler curve. This is a graph
of the magnitude of a cyclic stress (S) against the logarithmic_scale of cycles
to failure (N).[25]
S-N curve for a brittle aluminium with an ultimate tensile strength of 320 MPa
S-N curves are derived from tests on samples of the material to be
characterized (often called coupons) where a regular sinusoidal stress is
applied by a testing machine which also counts the number of cycles to failure.
This process is sometimes known as coupon testing. For greater accuracy but
lower generality component testing is used.[26] Each coupon or component test
generates a point on the plot though in some cases there is a runout where the
time to failure exceeds that available for the test (see censoring). Analysis
of fatigue data requires techniques from statistics, especially survival
analysis and linear_regression.
The progression of the S-N curve can be influenced by many factors such as
stress ratio (mean stress), loading frequency, temperature, corrosion, residual
stresses, and the presence of notches. A constant fatigue life (CFL) diagram
[27] is useful for the study of stress ratio effect. The Goodman-Line is a
method used to estimate the influence of the mean stress on the fatigue
strength.
A Constant Fatigue Life (CFL) diagram is useful for stress ratio effect on S-
N curve.[28] Also, in the presence of a steady stress superimposed on the
cyclic loading, the Goodman_relation can be used to estimate a failure
condition. It plots stress amplitude against mean stress with the fatigue limit
and the ultimate_tensile_strength of the material as the two extremes.
Alternative failure criteria include Soderberg and Gerber.[29]
As coupons sampled from a homogeneous frame will display a variation in their
number of cycles to failure, the S-N curve should more properly be a Stress-
Cycle-Probability (S-N-P) curve to capture the probability of failure after a
given number of cycles of a certain stress.
*** Strain-life (Îµ-N) method[edit] ***
Due to the proportionality between stress and strain, high cycle fatigue can
also be expressed as strain amplitude vs. number of cycles. High cycle fatigue
can be approximated by equating the total strain to just the elastic strain.
Using this approximation,
      &#x200b;1⁄2ÎÎµelastic â¡ &#x200b;Ïf'⁄E(2Nf)âb
where
      ÎÎµelastic is the change in elastic strain per cycle
      Ïf' is a parameter that scales with tensile strength obtained by fitting
      experimental data
      E is the Young's modulus
      Nf is the number of cycles to failure
      b is the slope of the log-log curve again determined by fitting
The figure below shows high cycle fatigue as the right-most linear portion. Any
test performed in the bottom left region (i.e. with a low enough strain
amplitude and number of cycles) below the dark line has a high probability to
avoid failure.
Graph showing fatigue failure as a function of strain amplitude.
As shown in the figure above (the left-most linear section) and as described in
the next section, the total strain is approximated to be equal to just the
plastic strain. For regions between high and low cycle fatigue, an unweighted
sum of the high cycle and low cycle expressions gives a reasonable
approximation with a built-in safety factor.[30]
**** Crack growth methods[edit] ****
Crack_growth_equations such as the Paris-Erdogen_equation are used to predict
the life of a component. They can be used to predict the growth of a crack from
10 um to failure. For normal manufacturing finishes this may cover the most of
the fatigue life of a component where growth can start from the first cycle.
[23]. The conditions at the crack tip of a component are usually related to the
conditions of test coupon using a characterising parameter such as the stress
intensity, J-integral or crack_tip_opening_displacement. All these techniques
aim to match the crack tip conditions on the component to that of test coupons
which give the rate of crack growth.
Additional models may be necessary to include retardation and acceleration
effects associated with overloads or underloads in the loading sequence. In
addition, small crack growth data may be needed to match the increased rate of
growth seen with small cracks.[31]
Typically, a cycle counting technique such as rainflow-cycle_counting is used
to extract the cycles from a complex sequence. This technique, along with
others, has been shown to work with crack growth methods.[32]
Crack growth methods have the advantage that they can predict the intermediate
size of cracks. This information can be used to schedule inspections on a
structure to ensure safety whereas strain/life methods only give a life until
failure.

***** Dealing with fatigue[edit] *****
**** Design[edit] ****
Dependable design against fatigue-failure requires thorough education and
supervised experience in structural_engineering, mechanical_engineering, or
materials_science. There are at least five principal approaches to life
assurance for mechanical parts that display increasing degrees of
sophistication:[35]
   1. Design to keep stress below threshold of fatigue_limit (infinite lifetime
      concept);
   2. Fail-safe, graceful_degradation, and fault-tolerant_design: Instruct the
      user to replace parts when they fail. Design in such a way that there is
      no single_point_of_failure, and so that when any one part completely
      fails, it does not lead to catastrophic failure of the entire system.
   3. Safe-life_design: Design (conservatively) for a fixed life after which
      the user is instructed to replace the part with a new one (a so-called
      lifed part, finite lifetime concept, or "safe-life" design practice);
      planned_obsolescence and disposable_product are variants that design for
      a fixed life after which the user is instructed to replace the entire
      device;
   4. Damage_tolerance: Is an approach that ensures aircraft safety by assuming
      the presence of cracks or defects even in new aircraft. Crack growth
      calculations, periodic inspections and component repair or replacement
      can be used to ensure critical components that may contain cracks, remain
      safe. Inspections usually use nondestructive_testing to limit or monitor
      the size of possible cracks and require an accurate prediction of the
      rate of crack-growth between inspections. The designer sets some aircraft
      maintenance_checks schedule frequent enough that parts are replaced while
      the crack is still in the "slow growth" phase. This is often referred to
      as damage tolerant design or "retirement-for-cause".
   5. Risk_Management: Ensures the probability of failure remains below an
      acceptable level. This approach is typically used for aircraft where
      acceptable levels may be based of probability of failure during a single
      flight or taken over the lifetime of an aircraft. A component is assumed
      to have a crack with a probability distribution of crack sizes. This
      approach can consider variability in values such as crack growth rates,
      usage and critical crack size.[36] It is also useful for considering
      damage at multiple locations that may interact to produce multi-site or
      widespread_fatigue_damage. Probability distributions that are common in
      data analysis and in design against fatigue include the log-normal
      distribution, extreme_value_distribution, BirnbaumâSaunders
      distribution, and Weibull_distribution.
**** Testing[edit] ****
Fatigue_testing can be used for components such as a coupon or a full-scale
test article to determine:
   1. the rate of crack growth and fatigue life of components such as a coupon
      or a full-scale test article.
   2. location of critical regions
   3. degree of fail-safety when part of the structure fails
   4. the origin and cause of the crack initiating defect from fractographic
      examination of the crack.
These tests may form part of the certification process such as for
airworthiness_certification.
**** Repair[edit] ****
   1. Stop drill Fatigue cracks that have begun to propagate can sometimes be
      stopped by drilling holes, called drill stops, in the path of the fatigue
      crack.[37] This is not recommended as a general practice because the hole
      represents a stress_concentration factor which depends on the size of the
      hole and geometry, though the hole is typically less of a stress
      concentration than the removed tip of the crack. The possibility remains
      of a new crack starting in the side of the hole. It is always far better
      to replace the cracked part entirely.
   2. Blend. Small cracks can be blended away and the surface cold worked or
      shot peened.
   3. Oversize holes. Holes with cracks growing from them can be drilled out to
      a larger hole to remove cracking and bushed to restore the original hole.
      Bushes can be cold shrink Interference_fit bushes to induce beneficial
      compressive residual stresses. The oversized hole can also be cold worked
      by drawing an oversized mandrel through the hole.[38]
   4. Patch. Cracks may be repaired by installing a patch or repair fitting.
      Composite patches have been used to restore the strength of aircraft
      wings after cracks have been detected or to lower the stress prior to
      cracking in order to improve the fatigue life.[39] Patches may restrict
      the ability to monitor fatigue cracks and may need to be removed and
      replaced for inspections.
**** Life improvement[edit] ****
Example of a HFMI treated steel highway bridge to avoid fatigue along the weld
transition.
   1. Change material. Changes in the materials used in parts can also improve
      fatigue life. For example, parts can be made from better fatigue rated
      metals. Complete replacement and redesign of parts can also reduce if not
      eliminate fatigue problems. Thus helicopter_rotor blades and propellers
      in metal are being replaced by composite equivalents. They are not only
      lighter, but also much more resistant to fatigue. They are more
      expensive, but the extra cost is amply repaid by their greater integrity,
      since loss of a rotor blade usually leads to total loss of the aircraft.
      A similar argument has been made for replacement of metal fuselages,
      wings and tails of aircraft.[40]
   2. Induce residual stresses Peening a surface can reduce such tensile
      stresses and create compressive residual_stress, which prevents crack
      initiation. Forms of peening include: shot_peening, using high-speed
      projectiles, high-frequency_impact_treatment (also called high-frequency
      mechanical impact) using a mechanical hammer,[41][42] and laser_peening
      which uses high-energy laser pulses. Low_plasticity_burnishing can also
      be used to induce compresses stress in fillets and cold work mandrels can
      be used for holes.[43] Increases in fatigue life and strength are
      proportionally related to the depth of the compressive residual stresses
      imparted. Shot peening imparts compressive residual stresses
      approximately 0.005 inches (0.1 mm) deep, while laser peening can go
      0.040 to 0.100 inches (1 to 2.5 mm) deep, or deeper.[44][failed
      verification]
   3. Deep Cryogenic treatment. The use of Deep Cryogenic treatment has been
      shown to increase resistance to fatigue failure. Springs used in
      industry, auto racing and firearms have been shown to last up to six
      times longer when treated. Heat checking, which is a form of thermal
      cyclic fatigue has been greatly delayed.[45]
   4. Re-profiling. Changing the shape of a stress concentration such as a hole
      or cutout may be used to extend the life of a component. Shape
      optimisation using numerical optimisation algorithms have been used to
      lower the stress concentration in wings and increase their life. [46]
***** Notable fatigue failures[edit] *****
**** Versailles train crash[edit] ****
left Versailles train disaster
right Drawing of a fatigue failure in an axle by Joseph Glynn, 1843
Main article: Versailles_rail_accident
Following the King_Louis-Philippe_I's celebrations at the Palace_of_Versailles,
a train returning to Paris crashed in May 1842 at Meudon after the leading
locomotive broke an axle. The carriages behind piled into the wrecked engines
and caught fire. At least 55 passengers were killed trapped in the carriages,
including the explorer Jules_Dumont_d'Urville. This accident is known in France
as the "Catastrophe ferroviaire de Meudon". The accident was witnessed by the
British locomotive engineer Joseph_Locke and widely reported in Britain. It was
discussed extensively by engineers, who sought an explanation.
The derailment had been the result of a broken locomotive axle. Rankine's
investigation of broken axles in Britain highlighted the importance of stress
concentration, and the mechanism of crack growth with repeated loading. His and
other papers suggesting a crack growth mechanism through repeated stressing,
however, were ignored, and fatigue failures occurred at an ever-increasing rate
on the expanding railway system. Other spurious theories seemed to be more
acceptable, such as the idea that the metal had somehow "crystallized". The
notion was based on the crystalline appearance of the fast fracture region of
the crack surface, but ignored the fact that the metal was already highly
crystalline.
**** de Havilland Comet[edit] ****
Main articles: BOAC_Flight_781 and South_African_Airways_Flight_201
The recovered (shaded) parts of the wreckage of G-ALYP and the site (arrowed)
of the failure
Two de_Havilland_Comet passenger jets broke up in mid-air and crashed within a
few months of each other in 1954. As a result, systematic tests were conducted
on a fuselage immersed and pressurised in a water tank. After the equivalent of
3,000 flights, investigators at the Royal_Aircraft_Establishment (RAE) were
able to conclude that the crash had been due to failure of the pressure cabin
at the forward Automatic_Direction_Finder window in the roof. This 'window' was
in fact one of two apertures for the aerials of an electronic navigation system
in which opaque fibreglass panels took the place of the window 'glass'. The
failure was a result of metal fatigue caused by the repeated pressurisation and
de-pressurisation of the aircraft cabin. Also, the supports around the windows
were riveted, not bonded, as the original specifications for the aircraft had
called for. The problem was exacerbated by the punch rivet construction
technique employed. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole
created by punch riveting caused manufacturing defect cracks which may have
caused the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet.
The fuselage roof fragment of G-ALYP on display in the Science Museum in
London, showing the two ADF windows at-which the initial failure occurred.[47]
The Comet's pressure cabin had been designed to a safety factor comfortably in
excess of that required by British Civil Airworthiness Requirements (2.5 times
the cabin proof_test pressure as opposed to the requirement of 1.33 times and
an ultimate load of 2.0 times the cabin pressure) and the accident caused a
revision in the estimates of the safe loading strength requirements of airliner
pressure cabins.
In addition, it was discovered that the stresses around pressure cabin
apertures were considerably higher than had been anticipated, especially around
sharp-cornered cut-outs, such as windows. As a result, all future jet_airliners
would feature windows with rounded corners, greatly reducing the stress
concentration. This was a noticeable distinguishing feature of all later models
of the Comet. Investigators from the RAE told a public inquiry that the sharp
corners near the Comets' window openings acted as initiation sites for cracks.
The skin of the aircraft was also too thin, and cracks from manufacturing
stresses were present at the corners.
**** Alexander L. Kielland oil platform capsizing[edit] ****
Fractures on the right side of the Alexander L. Kielland rig
The Alexander_L._Kielland was a Norwegian semi-submersible drilling_rig that
capsized whilst working in the Ekofisk_oil_field in March 1980, killing 123
people. The capsizing was the worst disaster in Norwegian waters since World
War II. The rig, located approximately 320 km east of Dundee, Scotland, was
owned by the Stavanger Drilling Company of Norway and was on hire to the United
States company Phillips_Petroleum at the time of the disaster. In driving rain
and mist, early in the evening of 27 March 1980 more than 200 men were off duty
in the accommodation on the Alexander L. Kielland. The wind was gusting to 40
knots with waves up to 12 m high. The rig had just been winched away from the
Edda production platform. Minutes before 18:30 those on board felt a 'sharp
crack' followed by 'some kind of trembling'. Suddenly the rig heeled over 30Â°
and then stabilised. Five of the six anchor cables had broken, with one
remaining cable preventing the rig from capsizing. The list continued to
increase and at 18:53 the remaining anchor cable snapped and the rig turned
upside down.
A year later in March 1981, the investigative report[48] concluded that the rig
collapsed owing to a fatigue crack in one of its six bracings (bracing D-6),
which connected the collapsed D-leg to the rest of the rig. This was traced to
a small 6 mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this
D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling
operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in
its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of
lamellar_tearing in the flange plate and cold cracks in the butt weld. Cold
cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange
plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in
the North_Sea), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse.
