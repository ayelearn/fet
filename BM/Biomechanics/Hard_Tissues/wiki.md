****** Hard tissue ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Hard tissue (also termed calcified tissue) is tissue which is mineralized and
has a firm intercellular_matrix.[1] The hard tissues of humans are bone, tooth
enamel, dentin, and cementum.[2] The term is in contrast to soft_tissue.

***** Bone[edit] *****
Main article: bone
Bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the vertebral skeleton. Bones
support and protect the various organs of the body, produce red and white_blood
cells, store minerals and also enable mobility. Bone_tissue is a type of dense
connective_tissue. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a
complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and
hard, and serve multiple functions. Mineralized osseous_tissue or bone tissue,
is of two types â cortical and cancellous and gives it rigidity and a coral-
like three-dimensional internal structure. Other types of tissue found in bones
include marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood_vessels and cartilage.
Bone is an active tissue composed of different cells. Osteoblasts are involved
in the creation and mineralisation of bone; osteocytes and osteoclasts are
involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue. The mineralised matrix of bone
tissue has an organic component mainly of collagen and an inorganic component
of bone_mineral made up of various salts.
***** Enamel[edit] *****
Main article: Tooth_enamel
Enamel is the hardest substance in the human body and contains the highest
percentage of minerals,[3] 96%, with water and organic material composing the
rest.[4] The primary mineral is hydroxyapatite, which is a crystalline calcium
phosphate.[5] Enamel is formed on the tooth while the tooth is developing
within the gum, before it erupts into the mouth. Once fully formed, it does not
contain blood vessels or nerves. Remineralisation_of_teeth can repair damage to
the tooth to a certain degree but damage beyond that cannot be repaired by the
body. The maintenance and repair of human tooth enamel is one of the primary
concerns of dentistry.
In humans, enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth, often
thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5 mm, and thinnest at its border with the
cementum at the cementoenamel_junction (CEJ).[6]
The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish (bluish) white.
At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color
sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color
of dentin and any material underneath the enamel strongly affects the
appearance of a tooth. The enamel on primary teeth has a more opaque
crystalline form and thus appears whiter than on permanent teeth.
The large amount of mineral in enamel accounts not only for its strength but
also for its brittleness.[7] Tooth enamel ranks 5 on Mohs_hardness_scale and
has a Young's_modulus of 83 GPa.[5] Dentin, less mineralized and less brittle,
3â4 in hardness, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support.[8] On
radiographs, the differences in the mineralization of different portions of the
tooth and surrounding periodontium can be noted; enamel appears lighter than
dentin or pulp since it is denser than both and more radiopaque.[9]
Enamel does not contain collagen, as found in other hard tissues such as dentin
and bone, but it does contain two unique classes of proteins: amelogenins and
enamelins. While the role of these proteins is not fully understood, it is
believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as a framework
for minerals to form on, among other functions.[7] Once it is mature, enamel is
almost totally without the softer organic matter. Enamel is avascular and has
no nerve supply within it and is not renewed, however, it is not a static
tissue as it can undergo mineralization changes.[10]
***** Dentin[edit] *****
Main article: dentin
By weight, 70% of dentin consists of the mineral hydroxylapatite, 20% is
organic material, and 10% is water.[9] Yellow in appearance, it greatly affects
the color of a tooth due to the translucency of enamel. Dentin, which is less
mineralized and less brittle than enamel, is necessary for the support of
enamel.[11] Dentin rates approximately 3 on the Mohs_scale of mineral hardness.
[12]
***** Cementum[edit] *****
Main article: cementum
Cementum is slightly softer than dentin and consists of about 45% to 50%
inorganic material (hydroxylapatite) by weight and 50% to 55% organic_matter
and water by weight.[13] The organic portion is composed primarily of collagen
and proteoglycans.[14] Cementum is avascular, receiving its nutrition through
its own imbedded cells from the surrounding vascular periodontal_ligament.[9]
The cementum is light yellow and slightly lighter in color than dentin. It has
the highest fluoride content of all mineralized tissue. Cementum also is
permeable to a variety of materials. It is formed continuously throughout life
because a new layer of cementum is deposited to keep the attachment intact as
the superficial layer of cementum ages. Cementum on the root ends surrounds the
apical foramen and may extend slightly onto the inner wall of the pulp canal.
