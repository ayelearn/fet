A tendon or sinew is a tough band of fibrous_connective_tissue that usually
connects muscle to bone and is capable of withstanding tension.
Tendons are similar to ligaments; both are made of collagen. Ligaments join one
bone to bone, while tendons connect muscle to bone for a proper functioning of
the body.

***** Structure[edit] *****
Histologically, tendons consist of dense_regular_connective_tissue fascicles
encased in dense_irregular_connective_tissue sheaths. Normal healthy tendons
are composed mostly of parallel arrays of collagen fibers closely packed
together. They are anchored to bone by Sharpey's_fibres. The dry mass of normal
tendons, which makes up about 30% of their total mass, is composed of about 86%
collagen, 2% elastin, 1–5% proteoglycans, and 0.2% inorganic components such as
copper, manganese, and calcium.[1][2] The collagen portion is made up of 97–98%
type I collagen, with small amounts of other types of collagen. These include
type II collagen in the cartilaginous zones, type III collagen in the reticulin
fibres of the vascular walls, type IX collagen, type IV collagen in the
basement membranes of the capillaries, type V collagen in the vascular walls,
and type X collagen in the mineralized fibrocartilage near the interface with
the bone.[1][3]
Collagen fibres coalesce into macroaggregates. After secretion from the cell,
the cleaved by procollagen N- and C-proteinases, and the tropocollagen
molecules spontaneously assemble into insoluble fibrils. A collagen molecule is
about 300 nm long and 1–2 nm wide, and the diameter of the fibrils that are
formed can range from 50–500 nm. In tendons, the fibrils then assemble further
to form fascicles, which are about 10 mm in length with a diameter of 50–300
Î¼m, and finally into a tendon fibre with a diameter of 100–500 Î¼m.[4]
Fascicles are bound by the endotendineum, which is a delicate loose connective
tissue containing thin collagen fibrils.[5][6] and elastic fibres.[7] Groups of
fascicles are bounded by the epitenon. Filling the interstitia within the
fascia where the tendon is located is the paratenon a fatty areolar_tissue.[8]
The collagen in tendons are held together with proteoglycan (a compound
consisting of a protein bonded to glycosaminoglycan groups, present especially
in connective tissue) components including decorin and, in compressed regions
of tendon, aggrecan, which are capable of binding to the collagen fibrils at
specific locations.[9] The proteoglycans are interwoven with the collagen
fibrils – their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains have multiple interactions
with the surface of the fibrils – showing that the proteoglycans are important
structurally in the interconnection of the fibrils.[10] The major GAG
components of the tendon are dermatan_sulfate and chondroitin_sulfate, which
associate with collagen and are involved in the fibril assembly process during
tendon development. Dermatan sulfate is thought to be responsible for forming
associations between fibrils, while chondroitin sulfate is thought to be more
involved with occupying volume between the fibrils to keep them separated and
help withstand deformation.[11] The dermatan sulfate side chains of decorin
aggregate in solution, and this behavior can assist with the assembly of the
collagen fibrils. When decorin molecules are bound to a collagen fibril, their
dermatan sulfate chains may extend and associate with other dermatan sulfate
chains on decorin that is bound to separate fibrils, therefore creating
interfibrillar bridges and eventually causing parallel alignment of the
fibrils.[12]
The tenocytes produce the collagen molecules, which aggregate end-to-end and
side-to-side to produce collagen fibrils. Fibril bundles are organized to form
fibres with the elongated tenocytes closely packed between them. There is a
three-dimensional network of cell processes associated with collagen in the
tendon. The cells communicate with each other through gap_junctions, and this
signalling gives them the ability to detect and respond to mechanical loading.
[13]
Blood vessels may be visualized within the endotendon running parallel to
collagen fibres, with occasional branching transverse anastomoses.
The internal tendon bulk is thought to contain no nerve fibres, but the
epitenon and paratenon contain nerve endings, while Golgi_tendon_organs are
present at the junction between tendon and muscle.
Tendon length varies in all major groups and from person to person. Tendon
length is, in practice, the deciding factor regarding actual and potential
muscle size. For example, all other relevant biological factors being equal, a
man with a shorter tendons and a longer biceps muscle will have greater
potential for muscle mass than a man with a longer tendon and a shorter muscle.
Successful bodybuilders will generally have shorter tendons. Conversely, in
sports requiring athletes to excel in actions such as running or jumping, it is
beneficial to have longer than average Achilles_tendon and a shorter calf
muscle.[14]
Tendon length is determined by genetic predisposition, and has not been shown
to either increase or decrease in response to environment, unlike muscles,
which can be shortened by trauma, use imbalances and a lack of recovery and
stretching.[15]
***** Functions[edit] *****
Magnified view of a Tendon.
Traditionally, tendons have been considered to be a mechanism by which muscles
connect to bone as well as muscles itself, functioning to transmit forces. This
connection allows tendons to passively modulate forces during locomotion,
providing additional stability with no active work. However, over the past two
decades, much research focused on the elastic properties of some tendons and
their ability to function as springs. Not all tendons are required to perform
the same functional role, with some predominantly positioning limbs, such as
the fingers when writing (positional tendons) and others acting as springs to
make locomotion more efficient (energy storing tendons).[16] Energy storing
tendons can store and recover energy at high efficiency. For example, during a
human stride, the Achilles tendon stretches as the ankle joint dorsiflexes.
During the last portion of the stride, as the foot plantar-flexes (pointing the
toes down), the stored elastic energy is released. Furthermore, because the
tendon stretches, the muscle is able to function with less or even no_change_in
length, allowing the muscle to generate greater force.
The mechanical properties of the tendon are dependent on the collagen fiber
diameter and orientation. The collagen fibrils are parallel to each other and
closely packed, but show a wave-like appearance due to planar undulations, or
crimps, on a scale of several micrometers.[17] In tendons, the collagen fibres
have some flexibility due to the absence of hydroxyproline and proline residues
at specific locations in the amino acid sequence, which allows the formation of
other conformations such as bends or internal loops in the triple helix and
results in the development of crimps.[18] The crimps in the collagen fibrils
allow the tendons to have some flexibility as well as a low compressive
stiffness. In addition, because the tendon is a multi-stranded structure made
up of many partially independent fibrils and fascicles, it does not behave as a
single rod, and this property also contributes to its flexibility.[19]
The proteoglycan components of tendons also are important to the mechanical
properties. While the collagen fibrils allow tendons to resist tensile stress,
the proteoglycans allow them to resist compressive stress. These molecules are
very hydrophilic, meaning that they can absorb a large amount of water and
therefore have a high swelling ratio. Since they are noncovalently bound to the
fibrils, they may reversibly associate and disassociate so that the bridges
between fibrils can be broken and reformed. This process may be involved in
allowing the fibril to elongate and decrease in diameter under tension.[20]
However, the proteoglycans may also have a role in the tensile properties of
tendon. The structure of tendon is effectively a fibre composite material,
built as a series of hierarchical levels. At each level of the hierarchy, the
collagen units are bound together by either collagen crosslinks, or the
proteoglycans, to create a structure highly resistant to tensile load.[21] The
elongation and the strain of the collagen fibrils alone have been shown to be
much lower than the total elongation and strain of the entire tendon under the
same amount of stress, demonstrating that the proteoglycan-rich matrix must
also undergo deformation, and stiffening of the matrix occurs at high strain
rates.[22] This deformation of the non-collagenous matrix occurs at all levels
of the tendon hierarchy, and by modulating the organisation and structure of
this matrix, the different mechanical properties required by different tendons
can be achieved.[23] Energy storing tendons have been shown to utilise
significant amounts of sliding between fascicles to enable the high strain
characteristics they require, whilst positional tendons rely more heavily on
sliding between collagen fibres and fibrils.[24] However, recent data suggests
that energy storing tendons may also contain fascicles which are twisted, or
helical, in nature - an arrangement that would be highly beneficial for
providing the spring-like behaviour required in these tendons.[25]
**** Mechanics[edit] ****
Main article: Soft_tissue
Tendons are viscoelastic structures, which means they exhibit both elastic and
viscous behaviour. When stretched, tendons exhibit typical "soft tissue"
behavior. The force-extension, or stress-strain curve starts with a very low
stiffness region, as the crimp structure straightens and the collagen fibres
align suggesting negative Poisson's ratio in the fibres of the tendon.[26] More
recently, tests carried out in vivo (through MRI) and ex vivo (through
mechanical testing of various cadaveric tendon tissue) have shown that healthy
tendons are highly anisotropic and exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic)
in some planes when stretched up to 2% along their length, i.e. within their
normal range of motion.[27] After this 'toe' region, the structure becomes
significantly stiffer, and has a linear stress-strain curve until it begins to
fail. The mechanical properties of tendons vary widely, as they are matched to
the functional requirements of the tendon. The energy storing tendons tend to
be more elastic, or less stiff, so they can more easily store energy, whilst
the stiffer positional tendons tend to be a little more viscoelastic, and less
elastic, so they can provide finer control of movement. A typical energy
storing tendon will fail at around 12-15% strain, and a stress in the region of
100-150 MPa, although some tendons are notably more extensible than this, for
example the superficial digital flexor in the horse, which stretches in excess
of 20% when galloping.[28] Positional tendons can fail at strains as low as 6-
8%, but can have moduli in the region of 700-1000 MPa.[29]
Several studies have demonstrated that tendons respond to changes in mechanical
loading with growth and remodeling processes, much like bones. In particular, a
study showed that disuse of the Achilles_tendon in rats resulted in a decrease
in the average thickness of the collagen fiber bundles comprising the tendon.
[30] In humans, an experiment in which people were subjected to a simulated
micro-gravity environment found that tendon stiffness decreased significantly,
even when subjects were required to perform restiveness exercises.[31] These
effects have implications in areas ranging from treatment of bedridden patients
to the design of more effective exercises for astronauts.
**** Healing[edit] ****
The tendons in the foot are highly complex and intricate. Therefore, the
healing process for a broken tendon is long and painful. Most people who do not
receive medical attention within the first 48 hours of the injury will suffer
from severe swelling, pain, and a burning sensation where the injury occurred.
It was believed that tendons could not undergo matrix turnover and that
tenocytes were not capable of repair. However, it has since been shown that,
throughout the lifetime of a person, tenocytes in the tendon actively
synthesize matrix components as well as enzymes such as matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade the matrix.[32] Tendons are capable of
healing and recovering from injuries in a process that is controlled by the
tenocytes and their surrounding extracellular matrix.
The three main stages of tendon healing are inflammation, repair or
proliferation, and remodeling, which can be further divided into consolidation
and maturation. These stages can overlap with each other. In the first stage,
inflammatory cells such as neutrophils are recruited to the injury site, along
with erythrocytes. Monocytes and macrophages are recruited within the first 24
hours, and phagocytosis of necrotic materials at the injury site occurs. After
the release of vasoactive and chemotactic factors, angiogenesis and the
proliferation of tenocytes are initiated. Tenocytes then move into the site and
start to synthesize collagen III.[33][34] After a few days, the repair or
proliferation stage begins. In this stage, the tenocytes are involved in the
synthesis of large amounts of collagen and proteoglycans at the site of injury,
and the levels of GAG and water are high.[35] After about six weeks, the
remodeling stage begins. The first part of this stage is consolidation, which
lasts from about six to ten weeks after the injury. During this time, the
synthesis of collagen and GAGs is decreased, and the cellularity is also
decreased as the tissue becomes more fibrous as a result of increased
production of collagen I and the fibrils become aligned in the direction of
mechanical stress.[34] The final maturation stage occurs after ten weeks, and
during this time there is an increase in crosslinking of the collagen fibrils,
which causes the tissue to become stiffer. Gradually, over about one year, the
tissue will turn from fibrous to scar-like.[35]
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a very important role in the degradation
and remodeling of the ECM during the healing process after a tendon injury.
Certain MMPs including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, and MMP-14 have collagenase
activity, meaning that, unlike many other enzymes, they are capable of
degrading collagen I fibrils. The degradation of the collagen fibrils by MMP-
1 along with the presence of denatured collagen are factors that are believed
to cause weakening of the tendon ECM and an increase in the potential for
another rupture to occur.[36] In response to repeated mechanical loading or
injury, cytokines may be released by tenocytes and can induce the release of
MMPs, causing degradation of the ECM and leading to recurring injury and
chronic tendinopathies.[34]
A variety of other molecules are involved in tendon repair and regeneration.
There are five growth factors that have been shown to be significantly
upregulated and active during tendon healing: insulin-like_growth_factor_1
(IGF-I), platelet-derived_growth_factor (PDGF), vascular_endothelial_growth
factor (VEGF), basic_fibroblast_growth_factor (bFGF), and transforming_growth
factor_beta (TGF-Î²).[35] These growth factors all have different roles during
the healing process. IGF-1 increases collagen and proteoglycan production
during the first stage of inflammation, and PDGF is also present during the
early stages after injury and promotes the synthesis of other growth factors
along with the synthesis of DNA and the proliferation of tendon cells.[35] The
three isoforms of TGF-Î² (TGF-Î²1, TGF-Î²2, TGF-Î²3) are known to play a role
in wound healing and scar formation.[37] VEGF is well known to promote
angiogenesis and to induce endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and
VEGF mRNA has been shown to be expressed at the site of tendon injuries along
with collagen I mRNA.[38] Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a subgroup of
TGF-Î² superfamily that can induce bone and cartilage formation as well as
tissue differentiation, and BMP-12 specifically has been shown to influence
formation and differentiation of tendon tissue and to promote fibrogenesis.
*** Effects of activity on healing[edit] ***
In animal models, extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the
effects of mechanical strain in the form of activity level on tendon injury and
healing. While stretching can disrupt healing during the initial inflammatory
phase, it has been shown that controlled movement of the tendons after about
one week following an acute injury can help to promote the synthesis of
collagen by the tenocytes, leading to increased tensile strength and diameter
of the healed tendons and fewer adhesions than tendons that are immobilized. In
chronic tendon injuries, mechanical loading has also been shown to stimulate
fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis along with collagen
realignment, all of which promote repair and remodeling.[35] To further support
the theory that movement and activity assist in tendon healing, it has been
shown that immobilization of the tendons after injury often has a negative
effect on healing. In rabbits, collagen fascicles that are immobilized have
shown decreased tensile strength, and immobilization also results in lower
amounts of water, proteoglycans, and collagen crosslinks in the tendons.[33]
Several mechanotransduction mechanisms have been proposed as reasons for the
response of tenocytes to mechanical force that enable them to alter their gene
expression, protein synthesis, and cell phenotype, and eventually cause changes
in tendon structure. A major factor is mechanical deformation of the
extracellular_matrix, which can affect the actin_cytoskeleton and therefore
affect cell shape, motility, and function. Mechanical forces can be transmitted
by focal adhesion sites, integrins, and cell-cell junctions. Changes in the
actin cytoskeleton can activate integrins, which mediate âoutside-inâ and
âinside-outâ signaling between the cell and the matrix. G-proteins, which
induce intracellular signaling cascades, may also be important, and ion
channels are activated by stretching to allow ions such as calcium, sodium, or
potassium to enter the cell.[35]
***** Society and culture[edit] *****
Sinew was widely used throughout pre-industrial eras as a tough, durable fiber.
Some specific uses include using sinew as thread for sewing, attaching feathers
to arrows (see fletch), lashing tool blades to shafts, etc. It is also
recommended in survival guides as a material from which strong cordage can be
made for items like traps or living structures. Tendon must be treated in
specific ways to function usefully for these purposes. Inuit and other
circumpolar_people utilized sinew as the only cordage for all domestic purposes
due to the lack of other suitable fiber sources in their ecological habitats.
The elastic properties of particular sinews were also used in composite
recurved_bows favoured by the steppe nomads of Eurasia, and Native Americans.
The first stone throwing artillery also used the elastic properties of sinew.
Sinew makes for an excellent cordage material for three reasons: It is
extremely strong, it contains natural glues, and it shrinks as it dries, doing
away with the need for knots.
**** Culinary uses[edit] ****
Main article: Tendon_(meal)
Tendon (in particular, beef tendon) is used as a food in some Asian cuisines
(often served at yum_cha or dim_sum restaurants). One popular dish is suan bao
niu jin, in which the tendon is marinated in garlic. It is also sometimes found
in the Vietnamese noodle dish phá».
***** Clinical significance[edit] *****
**** Injury[edit] ****
Tendons are subject to many types of injuries. There are various forms of
tendinopathies or tendon injuries due to overuse. These types of injuries
generally result in inflammation and degeneration or weakening of the tendons,
which may eventually lead to tendon rupture.[33] Tendinopathies can be caused
by a number of factors relating to the tendon extracellular matrix (ECM), and
their classification has been difficult because their symptoms and
histopathology often are similar.
The first category of tendinopathy is paratenonitis, which refers to
inflammation of the paratenon, or paratendinous sheet located between the
tendon and its sheath. Tendinosis refers to non-inflammatory injury to the
tendon at the cellular level. The degradation is caused by damage to collagen,
cells, and the vascular components of the tendon, and is known to lead to
rupture.[39] Observations of tendons that have undergone spontaneous rupture
have shown the presence of collagen fibrils that are not in the correct
parallel orientation or are not uniform in length or diameter, along with
rounded tenocytes, other cell abnormalities, and the ingrowth of blood vessels.
[33] Other forms of tendinosis that have not led to rupture have also shown the
degeneration, disorientation, and thinning of the collagen fibrils, along with
an increase in the amount of glycosaminoglycans between the fibrils.[34] The
third is paratenonitis with tendinosis, in which combinations of paratenon
inflammation and tendon degeneration are both present. The last is tendinitis,
which refers to degeneration with inflammation of the tendon as well as
vascular disruption.[1]
Tendinopathies may be caused by several intrinsic factors including age, body
weight, and nutrition. The extrinsic factors are often related to sports and
include excessive forces or loading, poor training techniques, and
environmental conditions.[32]
***** Other animals[edit] *****
Ossified tendon from an Edmontosaurus bone bed in Wyoming (Lance Formation)
In some organisms, notable ones being birds[40] and ornithischian dinosaurs,
[41] portions of the tendon can become ossified. In this process, osteocytes
infiltrate the tendon and lay down bone as they would in sesamoid bone such as
the patella. In birds, tendon ossification primarily occurs in the hindlimb,
while in ornithischian dinosaurs, ossified axial muscle tendons form a
latticework along the neural and haemal spines on the tail, presumably for
support.
