Electrocardiography is the process of producing an electrocardiogram (ECG or
EKG[a]), a recording √¢¬Ä¬ì a graph of voltage versus time √¢¬Ä¬ì of the electrical
activity of the heart[4] using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes
detect the small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle
depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle
(heartbeat). Changes in the normal ECG pattern occur in numerous cardiac
abnormalities, including cardiac rhythm disturbances (such as atrial
fibrillation and ventricular_tachycardia), inadequate coronary artery blood
flow (such as myocardial_ischemia and myocardial_infarction), and electrolyte
disturbances (such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia).
In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient's limbs
and on the surface of the chest. The overall magnitude of the heart's
electrical_potential is then measured from twelve different angles ("leads")
and is recorded over a period of time (usually ten seconds). In this way, the
overall magnitude and direction of the heart's electrical depolarization is
captured at each moment throughout the cardiac_cycle.[5]
There are three main components to an ECG: the P_wave, which represents the
depolarization of the atria; the QRS_complex, which represents the
depolarization of the ventricles; and the T_wave, which represents the
repolarization of the ventricles.[6]
During each heartbeat, a healthy heart has an orderly progression of
depolarization that starts with pacemaker_cells in the sinoatrial_node, spreads
throughout the atrium, passes through the atrioventricular_node down into the
bundle_of_His and into the Purkinje_fibers, spreading down and to the left
throughout the ventricles.[6] This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise
to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a
large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function
of its electrical conduction system.[7] Among other things, an ECG can be used
to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the
heart_chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or
conduction system, the effects of heart drugs, and the function of implanted
pacemakers.[8]

Normal 12-lead ECG

The overall goal of performing an ECG is to obtain information about the
electrical function of the heart. Medical uses for this information are varied
and often need to be combined with knowledge of the structure of the heart and
physical examination signs to be interpreted. Some indications for performing
an ECG include:
    * Chest pain or suspected myocardial_infarction (heart attack), such as ST
      elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI)[9] or non-ST elevated myocardial
      infarction (NSTEMI)[10]
    * Symptoms such as shortness_of_breath, murmurs,[11] fainting, seizures,
      funny turns or arrhythmias including new onset palpitations or monitoring
      of known cardiac arrhythmias
    * Medication monitoring (e.g. drug-induced_QT_prolongation, Digoxin
      toxicity) and management of overdose (e.g. tricyclic_overdose)
    * Electrolyte_abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia
    * Perioperative monitoring in which any form of anesthesia is involved
      (e.g. monitored_anesthesia_care, general_anesthesia). This includes
      preoperative_asessment, intraoperative and postoperative monitoring.
    * Cardiac_stress_testing
    * Computed_tomography_angiography (CTA) and magnetic_resonance_angiography
      (MRA) of the heart (ECG is used to "gate" the scanning so that the
      anatomical position of the heart is steady)
    * Clinical_cardiac_electrophysiology in which a catheter is inserted
      through the femoral_vein and can have several electrodes along its length
      to record the direction of electrical activity from within the heart.
ECGs can be recorded as short intermittent tracings or continuous ECG
monitoring. Continuous monitoring is used for critically ill patients, patients
undergoing general anesthesia,[11] and patients who have an infrequently
occurring cardiac arrhythmia that would unlikely be seen on a conventional ten-
second ECG. Continuous monitoring can be conducted by using Holter_monitors,
internal and external defibrillators and pacemakers, and/or biotelemetry.
**** Screening[edit] ****
Evidence does not support the use of ECGs among those without symptoms or at
low risk of cardiovascular_disease as an effort for prevention.[12][13][14]
This is because an ECG may falsely indicate the existence of a problem, leading
to misdiagnosis, the recommendation of invasive procedures, and overtreatment.
However, persons employed in certain critical occupations, such as aircraft
pilots,[15] may be required to have an ECG as part of their routine health
evaluations. Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy screening may also be considered in
adolescents as part of a sports_physical out of concern for sudden_cardiac
death.
***** Electrocardiograph machines[edit] *****
An electrocardiograph with integrated display and keyboard on a wheeled cart
Electrocardiographs are recorded by machines that consist of a set of
electrodes connected to a central unit. Early ECG machines were constructed
with analog_electronics where the signal drove a motor to print out the signal
onto paper. Today, electrocardiographs use analog-to-digital_converters to
convert the electrical activity of the heart to a digital_signal. Many ECG
machines are now portable and commonly include a screen, keyboard, and printer
on a small wheeled cart. Recent advancements in electrocardiography include
developing even smaller devices for inclusion in fitness trackers and smart
watches.[16] These smaller devices often rely on only two electrodes to deliver
a single lead.[17]
Recording an ECG is a safe and painless procedure.[18] The machines are powered
by mains_power but they are designed with several safety features including an
earthed (ground) lead. Other features include:
    * Defibrillation protection: any ECG used in healthcare may be attached to
      a person who requires defibrillation and the ECG needs to protect itself
      from this source of energy.
    * Electrostatic_discharge is similar to defibrillation discharge and
      requires voltage protection up to 18,000 volts.
    * Additionally circuitry called the right_leg_driver can be used to reduce
      common-mode_interference (typically the 50 or 60¬†Hz mains power).
    * ECG voltages measured across the body are very small. This low voltage
      necessitates a low noise circuit and instrumentation_amplifiers.
    * Simultaneous lead recordings: Earlier designs recorded each lead
      sequentially, but current models record multiple leads simultaneously.
Most modern ECG machines include automated interpretation algorithms. This
analysis calculates features such as the PR_interval, QT_interval, corrected QT
(QTc) interval, PR axis, QRS axis, rhythm and more. The results from these
automated algorithms are considered "preliminary" until verified and/or
modified by expert interpretation. Despite recent advances, computer
misinterpretation remains a significant problem and can result in clinical
mismanagement.[19]
***** Electrodes and leads[edit] *****
Proper placement of the limb electrodes. The limb electrodes can be far down on
the limbs or close to the hips/shoulders as long as they are placed
symmetrically.[20]
Placement of the precordial electrodes
Electrodes are the actual conductive pads attached to the body surface.[21] Any
pair of electrodes can measure the electrical_potential_difference between the
two corresponding locations of attachment. Such a pair forms a lead. However,
"leads" can also be formed between a physical electrode and a virtual
electrode, known as the Wilson's central terminal, whose potential is defined
as the average potential measured by three limb electrodes that are attached to
the right arm, the left arm, and the left foot, respectively.
Commonly, 10 electrodes attached to the body are used to form 12 ECG leads,
with each lead measuring a specific electrical potential difference (as listed
in the table below).[22]
Leads are broken down into three types: limb; augmented limb; and precordial or
chest. The 12-lead ECG has a total of three limb leads and three augmented limb
leads arranged like spokes of a wheel in the coronal_plane (vertical), and six
precordial leads or chest leads that lie on the perpendicular transverse_plane
(horizontal).[23]
In medical settings, the term leads is also sometimes used to refer to the
electrodes themselves, although this is technically incorrect. This misuse of
terminology can be the source of confusion.[citation_needed]
The 10 electrodes in a 12-lead ECG are listed below.[24]
Electrode name Electrode placement
RA             On the right arm, avoiding thick muscle.
LA             In the same location where RA was placed, but on the left arm.
RL             On the right leg, lower end of inner aspect of calf_muscle.
               (Avoid bony prominences)
LL             In the same location where RL was placed, but on the left leg.
V1             In the fourth intercostal_space (between ribs 4 and 5) just to
               the right of the sternum (breastbone).
V2             In the fourth intercostal space (between ribs 4 and 5) just to
               the left of the sternum.
V3             Between leads V2 and V4.
V4             In the fifth intercostal space (between ribs 5 and 6) in the
               mid-clavicular_line.
V5             Horizontally even with V4, in the left anterior_axillary_line.
V6             Horizontally even with V4 and V5 in the mid-axillary_line.
Two types of electrodes in common use are a flat paper-thin sticker and a self-
adhesive circular pad. The former are typically used in a single ECG recording
while the latter are for continuous recordings as they stick longer. Each
electrode consists of an electrically_conductive electrolyte gel and a silver/
silver_chloride conductor.[25] The gel typically contains potassium_chloride
√¢¬Ä¬ì sometimes silver_chloride as well √¢¬Ä¬ì to permit electron conduction from
the skin to the wire and to the electrocardiogram.
The common virtual electrode, known as the Wilson's central terminal (VW), is
produced by averaging the measurements from the electrodes RA, LA, and LL to
give an average potential of the body:
          V  W   =   1 3   ( R A + L A + L L )   {\displaystyle V_{W}={\frac
      {1}{3}}(RA+LA+LL)}  [
      V_W = \frac{1}{3}(RA+LA+LL)
      ]
In a 12-lead ECG, all leads except the limb leads are unipolar (aVR, aVL, aVF,
V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6). The measurement of a voltage requires two contacts
and so, electrically, the unipolar leads are measured from the common lead
(negative) and the unipolar lead (positive). This averaging for the common lead
and the abstract unipolar lead concept makes for a more challenging
understanding and is complicated by sloppy usage of "lead" and "electrode".
**** Limb leads[edit] ****
The limb leads and augmented limb leads (Wilson's central terminal is used as
the negative pole for the latter in this representation)
[EKG_leads.png]
Leads I, II and III are called the limb leads. The electrodes that form these
signals are located on the limbs √¢¬Ä¬ì one on each arm and one on the left leg.
[26][27][28] The limb leads form the points of what is known as Einthoven's
triangle.[29]
    * Lead I is the voltage between the (positive) left arm (LA) electrode and
      right arm (RA) electrode:
         I = L A &#x2212; R A   {\displaystyle I=LA-RA}  [
      I = LA - RA
      ]
    * Lead II is the voltage between the (positive) left leg (LL) electrode and
      the right arm (RA) electrode:
         I I = L L &#x2212; R A   {\displaystyle II=LL-RA}  [
      II = LL - RA
      ]
    * Lead III is the voltage between the (positive) left leg (LL) electrode
      and the left arm (LA) electrode:
         I I I = L L &#x2212; L A   {\displaystyle III=LL-LA}  [
      III = LL - LA
      ]
**** Augmented limb leads[edit] ****
Leads aVR, aVL, and aVF are the augmented limb leads. They are derived from the
same three electrodes as leads I, II, and III, but they use Goldberger's
central terminal as their negative pole. Goldberger's central terminal is a
combination of inputs from two limb electrodes, with a different combination
for each augmented lead. It is referred to immediately below as "the negative
pole".
    * Lead augmented vector right (aVR) has the positive electrode on the right
      arm. The negative pole is a combination of the left arm electrode and the
      left leg electrode:
         a V R = R A &#x2212;   1 2   ( L A + L L ) =   3 2   ( R A &#x2212;  V
      W   )   {\displaystyle aVR=RA-{\frac {1}{2}}(LA+LL)={\frac {3}{2}}(RA-V_
      {W})}  [
      aVR = RA - \frac{1}{2} (LA + LL) = \frac 32 (RA - V_W)
      ]
    * Lead augmented vector left (aVL) has the positive electrode on the left
      arm. The negative pole is a combination of the right arm electrode and
      the left leg electrode:
         a V L = L A &#x2212;   1 2   ( R A + L L ) =   3 2   ( L A &#x2212;  V
      W   )   {\displaystyle aVL=LA-{\frac {1}{2}}(RA+LL)={\frac {3}{2}}(LA-V_
      {W})}  [
      aVL = LA - \frac{1}{2} (RA + LL) = \frac 32 (LA - V_W)
      ]
    * Lead augmented vector foot (aVF) has the positive electrode on the left
      leg. The negative pole is a combination of the right arm electrode and
      the left arm electrode:
         a V F = L L &#x2212;   1 2   ( R A + L A ) =   3 2   ( L L &#x2212;  V
      W   )   {\displaystyle aVF=LL-{\frac {1}{2}}(RA+LA)={\frac {3}{2}}(LL-V_
      {W})}  [
      aVF = LL - \frac{1}{2} (RA + LA) = \frac 32 (LL - V_W)
      ]
Together with leads I, II, and III, augmented limb leads aVR, aVL, and aVF form
the basis of the hexaxial_reference_system, which is used to calculate the
heart's electrical axis in the frontal plane.
**** Precordial leads[edit] ****
The precordial leads lie in the transverse (horizontal) plane, perpendicular to
the other six leads. The six precordial electrodes act as the positive poles
for the six corresponding precordial leads: (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6).
Wilson's central terminal is used as the negative pole.
**** Specialized leads[edit] ****
Additional electrodes may rarely be placed to generate other leads for specific
diagnostic purposes. Right-sided precordial leads may be used to better study
pathology of the right ventricle or for dextrocardia (and are denoted with an R
(e.g., V5R). Posterior leads (V7 to V9) may be used to demonstrate the presence
of a posterior myocardial infarction. A Lewis_lead (requiring an electrode at
the right sternal border in the second intercostal space) can be used to study
pathological rhythms arising in the right atrium.
An esophogeal lead can be inserted to a part of the esophagus where the
distance to the posterior wall of the left_atrium is only approximately
5√¢¬Ä¬ì6¬†mm (remaining constant in people of different age and weight).[30] An
esophageal lead avails for a more accurate differentiation between certain
cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial_flutter, AV_nodal_reentrant
tachycardia and orthodromic atrioventricular_reentrant_tachycardia.[31] It can
also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White_syndrome, as well
as terminate supraventricular_tachycardia caused by re-entry.[31]
An intracardiac electrogram (ICEG) is essentially an ECG with some added
intracardiac leads (that is, inside the heart). The standard ECG leads
(external leads) are I, II, III, aVL, V1, and V6. Two to four intracardiac
leads are added via cardiac catheterization. The word "electrogram" (EGM)
without further specification usually means an intracardiac electrogram.
**** Lead locations on an ECG report[edit] ****
A standard 12-lead ECG report (an electrocardiograph) shows a 2.5 second
tracing of each of the twelve leads. The tracings are most commonly arranged in
a grid of four columns and three rows. the first column is the limb leads (I,
II, and III), the second column is the augmented limb leads (aVR, aVL, and
aVF), and the last two columns are the precordial leads (V1 to V6).
Additionally, a rhythm strip may be included as a fourth or fifth row.
The timing across the page is continuous and not tracings of the 12 leads for
the same time period. In other words, if the output were traced by needles on
paper, each row would switch which leads as the paper is pulled under the
needle. For example, the top row would first trace lead I, then switch to lead
aVR, then switch to V1, and then switch to V4 and so none of these four
tracings of the leads are from the same time period as they are traced in
sequence through time.
**** Contiguity of leads[edit] ****
Diagram showing the contiguous leads in the same color in the standard 12-lead
layout
Each of the 12 ECG leads records the electrical activity of the heart from a
different angle, and therefore align with different anatomical areas of the
heart. Two leads that look at neighboring anatomical areas are said to be
contiguous.

                                     surface_of_heart)
In addition, any two precordial leads next to one another are considered to be
contiguous. For example, though V4 is an anterior lead and V5 is a lateral
lead, they are contiguous because they are next to one another.
***** Electrophysiology[edit] *****
Main article: Cardiac_electrophysiology
The study of the conduction system of the heart is called cardiac
electrophysiology (EP). An EP study is performed via a right-sided cardiac
catheterization: a wire with an electrode at its tip is inserted into the right
heart chambers from a peripheral vein, and placed in various positions in close
proximity to the conduction system so that the electrical activity of that
system can be recorded.
***** Interpretation[edit] *****
Interpretation of the ECG is fundamentally about understanding the electrical
conduction_system_of_the_heart. Normal conduction starts and propagates in a
predictable pattern, and deviation from this pattern can be a normal variation
or be pathological. An ECG does not equate with mechanical pumping activity of
the heart, for example, pulseless_electrical_activity produces an ECG that
should pump blood but no pulses are felt (and constitutes a medical_emergency
and CPR should be performed). Ventricular_fibrillation produces an ECG but is
too dysfunctional to produce a life-sustaining cardiac output. Certain rhythms
are known to have good cardiac output and some are known to have bad cardiac
output. Ultimately, an echocardiogram or other anatomical imaging modality is
useful in assessing the mechanical function of the heart.
Like all medical tests, what constitutes "normal" is based on population
studies. The heartrate range of between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is
considered normal since data shows this to be the usual resting heart rate.
**** Theory[edit] ****
QRS is upright in a lead when its axis is aligned with that lead's vector
Schematic representation of a normal ECG
Interpretation of the ECG is ultimately that of pattern recognition. In order
to understand the patterns found, it is helpful to understand the theory of
what ECGs represent. The theory is rooted in electromagnetics and boils down to
the four following points:
    * depolarization of the heart toward the positive electrode produces a
      positive deflection
    * depolarization of the heart away from the positive electrode produces a
      negative deflection
    * repolarization of the heart toward the positive electrode produces a
      negative deflection
    * repolarization of the heart away from the positive electrode produces a
      positive deflection
Thus, the overall direction of depolarization and repolarization produces a
vector that produces positive or negative deflection on the ECG depending on
which lead it points to. For example, depolarizing from right to left would
produce a positive deflection in lead I because the two vectors point in the
same direction. In contrast, that same depolarization would produce minimal
deflection in V1 and V2 because the vectors are perpendicular and this
phenomenon is called isoelectric.
Normal rhythm produces four entities √¢¬Ä¬ì a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and
a U wave √¢¬Ä¬ì that each have a fairly unique pattern.
    * The P wave represents atrial depolarization.
    * The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization.
    * The T wave represents ventricular repolarization.
    * The U wave represents papillary muscle repolarization.
However, the U wave is not typically seen and its absence is generally ignored.
Changes in the structure of the heart and its surroundings (including blood
composition) change the patterns of these four entities.
**** Background grid[edit] ****
ECGs are normally printed on a grid. The horizontal axis represents time and
the vertical axis represents voltage. The standard values on this grid are
shown in the adjacent image:
    * A small box is 1¬†mm √É¬ó 1¬†mm and represents 0.1 mV √É¬ó 0.04 seconds.
    * A large box is 5¬†mm √É¬ó 5¬†mm and represents 0.5 mV √É¬ó 0.20 seconds.
The "large" box is represented by a heavier line_weight than the small boxes.
[Measuring_time_and_voltage_with_ECG_graph_paper]
Not all aspects of an ECG rely on precise recordings or having a known scaling
of amplitude or time. For example, determining if the tracing is a sinus rhythm
only requires feature recognition and matching, and not measurement of
amplitudes or times (i.e., the scale of the grids are irrelevant). An example
to the contrary, the voltage requirements of left_ventricular_hypertrophy
require knowing the grid scale.
**** Rate and rhythm[edit] ****
In a normal heart, the heart rate is the rate in which the sinoatrial_node
depolarizes as it is the source of depolarization of the heart. Heart rate,
like other vital_signs like blood pressure and respiratory rate, change with
age. In adults, a normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm (normocardic)
where in children it is higher. A heart rate less than normal is called
bradycardia (<60 in adults) and higher than normal is tachycardia (>100 in
adults). A complication of this is when the atria and ventricles are not in
synchrony and the "heart rate" must be specified as atrial or ventricular
(e.g., the ventricular rate in ventricular_fibrillation is 300√¢¬Ä¬ì600 bpm,
whereas the atrial rate can be normal [60√¢¬Ä¬ì100] or faster [100√¢¬Ä¬ì150]).
In normal resting hearts, the physiologic rhythm of the heart is normal_sinus
rhythm (NSR). Normal sinus rhythm produces the prototypical pattern of P wave,
QRS complex, and T wave. Generally, deviation from normal sinus rhythm is
considered a cardiac_arrhythmia. Thus, the first question in interpreting an
ECG is whether or not there is a sinus rhythm. A criterion for sinus rhythm is
that P waves and QRS complexes appear 1-to-1, thus implying that the P wave
causes the QRS complex.
Once sinus rhythm is established, or not, the second question is the rate. For
a sinus rhythm this is either the rate of P waves or QRS complexes since they
are 1-to-1. If the rate is too fast then it is sinus_tachycardia and if it is
too slow then it is sinus_bradycardia.
If it is not a sinus rhythm, then determining the rhythm is necessary before
proceeding with further interpretation. Some arrhythmias with characteristic
findings:
    * Absent P waves with "irregularly irregular" QRS complexes is the hallmark
      of atrial_fibrillation
    * A "saw tooth" pattern with QRS complexes is the hallmark of atrial
      flutter
    * Sine_wave pattern is the hallmark of ventricular_flutter
    * Absent P waves with wide QRS complexes and a fast heart rate is
      ventricular_tachycardia
Determination of rate and rhythm is necessary in order to make sense of further
interpretation.
**** Axis[edit] ****
The heart has several axes, but the most common by far is the axis of the QRS
complex (references to "the axis" imply the QRS axis). Each axis can be
computationally determined to result in a number representing degrees of
deviation from zero, or it can be categorized into a few types.
The QRS axis is the general direction of the ventricular depolarization
wavefront (or mean electrical vector) in the frontal plane. It is often
sufficient to classify the axis as one of three types: normal, left deviated,
or right deviated. Population data shows that a normal QRS axis is from √¢¬à¬í30√Ç¬∞
to 105√Ç¬∞, with 0√Ç¬∞ being along lead I and positive being inferior and negative
being superior (best understood graphically as the hexaxial_reference_system).
[32] Beyond +105√Ç¬∞ is right_axis_deviation and beyond √¢¬à¬í30√Ç¬∞ is left_axis
deviation (the third quadrant of √¢¬à¬í90√Ç¬∞ to √¢¬à¬í180√Ç¬∞ is very rare and is an
indeterminate axis). A shortcut for determining if the QRS axis is normal is if
the QRS complex is mostly positive in lead I and lead II (or lead I and aVF if
+90√Ç¬∞ is the upper limit of normal).
The normal QRS axis is generally down and to the left, following the anatomical
orientation of the heart within the chest. An abnormal axis suggests a change
in the physical shape and orientation of the heart or a defect in its
conduction system that causes the ventricles to depolarize in an abnormal way.

**** Amplitudes and intervals[edit] ****
Animation of a normal ECG wave
All of the waves on an ECG tracing and the intervals between them have a
predictable time duration, a range of acceptable amplitudes (voltages), and a
typical morphology. Any deviation from the normal tracing is potentially
pathological and therefore of clinical significance.
For ease of measuring the amplitudes and intervals, an ECG is printed on graph
paper at a standard scale: each 1¬†mm (one small box on the standard ECG paper)
represents 40 milliseconds of time on the x-axis, and 0.1 millivolts on the y-
axis.

**** Ischemia and infarction[edit] ****
Main article: Electrocardiography_in_myocardial_infarction
Ischemia or non-ST_elevation_myocardial_infarctions (non-STEMIs) may manifest
as ST_depression or inversion of T_waves. It may also affect the high_frequency
band_of_the_QRS.
ST_elevation_myocardial_infarctions (STEMIs) have different characteristic ECG
findings based on the amount of time elapsed since the MI first occurred. The
earliest sign is hyperacute T waves, peaked T waves due to local hyperkalemia
in ischemic myocardium. This then progresses over a period of minutes to
elevations of the ST_segment by at least 1¬†mm. Over a period of hours, a
pathologic Q_wave may appear and the T wave will invert. Over a period of days
the ST elevation will resolve. Pathologic Q waves generally will remain
permanently.[35]
The coronary_artery that has been occluded can be identified in an STEMI based
on the location of ST elevation. The left_anterior_descending (LAD) artery
supplies the anterior wall of the heart, and therefore causes ST elevations in
anterior leads (V1 and V2). The LCx supplies the lateral aspect of the heart
and therefore causes ST elevations in lateral leads (I, aVL and V6). The right
coronary_artery (RCA) usually supplies the inferior aspect of the heart, and
therefore causes ST elevations in inferior leads (II, III and aVF).
**** Artifacts[edit] ****
An ECG tracing is affected by patient motion. Some rhythmic motions (such as
shivering or tremors) can create the illusion of cardiac arrhythmia.[36]
Artifacts are distorted signals caused by a secondary internal or external
sources, such as muscle movement or interference from an electrical device.[37]
[38]
Distortion poses significant challenges to healthcare providers,[37] who employ
various techniques[39] and strategies to safely recognize[40] these false
signals.[medical_citation_needed] Accurately separating the ECG artifact from
the true ECG signal can have a significant impact on patient outcomes and legal
liabilities.[41][unreliable_medical_source?]
Improper lead placement (for example, reversing two of the limb leads) has been
estimated to occur in 0.4% to 4% of all ECG recordings,[42] and has resulted in
improper diagnosis and treatment including unnecessary use of thrombolytic
therapy.[43][44]
***** Diagnosis[edit] *****
Numerous diagnoses and findings can be made based upon electrocardiography, and
many are discussed above. Overall, the diagnoses are made based on the
patterns. For example, an "irregularly irregular" QRS complex without P waves
is the hallmark of atrial_fibrillation; however, other findings can be present
as well, such as a bundle_branch_block that alters the shape of the QRS
complexes. ECGs can be interpreted in isolation but should be applied √¢¬Ä¬ì like
all diagnostic_tests √¢¬Ä¬ì in the context of the patient. For example, an
observation of peaked T waves is not sufficient to diagnose hyperkalemia; such
a diagnosis should be verified by measuring the blood potassium level.
Conversely, a discovery of hyperkalemia should be followed by an ECG for
manifestations such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and loss of P
waves. The following is an organized list of possible ECG-based diagnoses.

    * In 1882, John_Burdon-Sanderson working with frogs, was the first to
      appreciate that the interval between variations in potential was not
      electrically quiescent and coined the term "isoelectric interval" for
      this period.[47]
    * In 1887, Augustus_Waller[48] invented an ECG machine consisting of a
      Lippmann_capillary_electrometer fixed to a projector. The trace from the
      heartbeat was projected onto a photographic plate that was itself fixed
      to a toy train. This allowed a heartbeat to be recorded in real time.
    * In 1895, Willem_Einthoven assigned the letters P, Q, R, S, and T to the
      deflections in the theoretical waveform he created using equations which
      corrected the actual waveform obtained by the capillary electrometer to
      compensate for the imprecision of that instrument. Using letters
      different from A, B, C, and D (the letters used for the capillary
      electrometer's waveform) facilitated comparison when the uncorrected and
      corrected lines were drawn on the same graph.[49] Einthoven probably
      chose the initial letter P to follow the example set by Descartes in
      geometry.[49] When a more precise waveform was obtained using the string
      galvanometer, which matched the corrected capillary electrometer
      waveform, he continued to use the letters P, Q, R, S, and T,[49] and
      these letters are still in use today. Einthoven also described the
      electrocardiographic features of a number of cardiovascular disorders.
    * In 1897, the string galvanometer was invented by the French engineer
      Cl√É¬©ment_Ader.[50]
    * In 1901, Einthoven, working in Leiden, the Netherlands, used the string
      galvanometer: the first practical ECG.[51] This device was much more
      sensitive than both the capillary electrometer Waller used and the string
      galvanometer.
    * In 1924, Einthoven was awarded the Nobel_Prize_in_Medicine for his
      pioneering work in developing the ECG.[52]
    * By 1927, General Electric had developed a portable apparatus that could
      produce electrocardiograms without the use of the string galvanometer.
      This device instead combined amplifier tubes similar to those used in a
      radio with an internal lamp and a moving mirror that directed the tracing
      of the electric pulses onto film.[53]
    * In 1937, Taro_Takemi invented a new portable electrocardiograph machine.
      [54]
    * Though the basic principles of that era are still in use today, many
      advances in electrocardiography have been made since 1937.
      Instrumentation has evolved from a cumbersome laboratory apparatus to
      compact electronic systems that often include computerized interpretation
      of the electrocardiogram.[55]
**** Etymology[edit] ****
An early commercial ECG device (1911)
ECG from 1957
The word is derived from the Greek electro, meaning related to electrical
activity; kardia, meaning heart; and graph, meaning "to write".

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ The version with '-K-', more commonly used in American_English than in
      British_English, is an early-20th-century loanword from the German
      acronym EKG for Elektrokardiogramm (electrocardiogram),[1] which reflects
      that German physicians were pioneers in the field at the time. Today AMA
      style and √¢¬Ä¬ì under its stylistic influence √¢¬Ä¬ì most American medical
      publications use ECG instead of EKG.[2] The German term
      Elektrokardiogramm as well as the English equivalent, electrocardiogram,
      consist of the New_Latin/international_scientific_vocabulary elements
      elektro- (cognate electro-) and kardi- (cognate 'cardi-'), the latter
      from Greek kardia (heart).[3] The '-K-' version is more often retained
      under circumstances where there may be verbal confusion between ECG and
      EEG (electroencephalography) due to similar pronunciation.
