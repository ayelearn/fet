From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Urban design is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of
cities, towns and villages and planning for the provision of municipal services
to residents and visitors. In contrast to architecture, which focuses on the
design of individual buildings, urban design deals with the larger scale of
groups of buildings, streets and public_spaces, whole neighbourhoods and
districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional,
attractive, and sustainable.[1]
Urban design is an inter-disciplinary field that utilizes elements of many
built environment professions, including landscape_architecture, urban
planning, architecture, civil_engineering and municipal_engineering.[2] It is
common for professionals in all these disciplines to practice urban design. In
more recent times different sub-subfields of urban design have emerged such as
strategic urban design, landscape_urbanism, water-sensitive_urban_design, and
sustainable_urbanism.
Urban design demands an understanding of a wide range of subjects from physical
geography to social science, and an appreciation for disciplines, such as real
estate_development, urban_economics, political_economy and social_theory.

Urban design is about making connections between people and places, movement
and urban form, nature and the built fabric. Urban design draws together the
many strands of place-making, environmental stewardship, social equity and
economic viability into the creation of places with distinct beauty and
identity. Urban design draws these and other strands together creating a vision
for an area and then deploying the resources and skills needed to bring the
vision to life.
Urban design theory deals primarily with the design and management of public
space (i.e. the 'public environment', 'public realm' or 'public domain'), and
the way public places are experienced and used. Public space includes the
totality of spaces used freely on a day-to-day basis by the general public,
such as streets, plazas, parks and public infrastructure. Some aspects of
privately owned spaces, such as building facades or domestic gardens, also
contribute to public space and are therefore also considered by urban design
theory. Important writers on urban design theory include Christopher_Alexander,
Peter_Calthorpe, Gordon_Cullen, Andres_Duany, Jane_Jacobs, Mitchell_Joachim,
Jan_Gehl, Allan_B._Jacobs, Kevin_Lynch, Aldo_Rossi, Colin_Rowe, Robert_Venturi,
William_H._Whyte, Camillo_Sitte, Bill Hillier (Space_syntax) and Elizabeth
Plater-Zyberk.

Although contemporary professional use of the term 'urban design' dates from
the mid-20th century, urban design as such has been practiced throughout
history. Ancient examples of carefully planned and designed cities exist in
Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas, and are particularly well known within
Classical Chinese, Roman and Greek cultures (see Hippodamus_of_Miletus).
[citation_needed]
European Medieval cities are often, and often erroneously, regarded as
exemplars of undesigned or 'organic' city development.[citation_needed] There
are many examples of considered urban design in the Middle Ages (see, e.g.,
David Friedman, Florentine New Towns: Urban Design in the Late Middle Ages, MIT
1988). In England, many of the towns listed in the 9th century Burghal_Hidage
were designed on a grid, examples including Southampton, Wareham,_Dorset and
Wallingford,_Oxfordshire, having been rapidly created to provide a defensive
network against Danish invaders.[citation_needed] 12th century western Europe
brought renewed focus on urbanisation as a means of stimulating economic growth
and generating revenue.[citation_needed] The burgage system dating from that
time and its associated burgage plots brought a form of self-organising design
to medieval towns.[citation_needed] Rectangular grids were used in the Bastides
of 13th and 14th century Gascony, and the new towns of England created in the
same period.[citation_needed]
Throughout history, design of streets and deliberate configuration of public
spaces with buildings have reflected contemporaneous social norms or
philosophical and religious beliefs (see, e.g., Erwin_Panofsky, Gothic
Architecture and Scholasticism, Meridian Books, 1957). Yet the link between
designed urban space and human mind appears to be bidirectional.[citation
needed] Indeed, the reverse impact of urban_structure upon human behaviour and
upon thought is evidenced by both observational study and historical record.
[citation_needed] There are clear indications of impact through Renaissance
urban design on the thought of Johannes_Kepler and Galileo_Galilei (see, e.g.,
Abraham Akkerman, "Urban planning in the founding of Cartesian thought,"
Philosophy and Geography 4(1), 1973). Already RenÃ©_Descartes in his Discourse
on_the_Method had attested to the impact Renaissance planned new towns had upon
his own thought, and much evidence exists that the Renaissance streetscape was
also the perceptual stimulus that had led to the development of coordinate
geometry (see, e.g., Claudia Lacour Brodsky, Lines of Thought: Discourse,
Architectonics, and the Origins of Modern Philosophy, Duke 1996).
The beginnings of modern urban design in Europe are associated with the
Renaissance but, especially, with the Age_of_Enlightenment.[citation_needed]
Spanish colonial cities were often planned, as were some towns settled by other
imperial cultures.[citation_needed] These sometimes embodied utopian ambitions
as well as aims for functionality and good governance, as with James
Oglethorpe's plan for Savannah,_Georgia.[citation_needed] In the Baroque period
the design approaches developed in French formal gardens such as Versailles
were extended into urban development and redevelopment. In this period, when
modern professional specialisations did not exist, urban design was undertaken
by people with skills in areas as diverse as sculpture, architecture, garden
design, surveying, astronomy, and military_engineering. In the 18th and 19th
centuries, urban design was perhaps most closely linked with surveyors
(engineers) and architects. The increase in urban populations brought with it
problems of epidemic disease,[citation_needed] the response to which was a
focus on public health, the rise in the UK of municipal_engineering and the
inclusion in British legislation of provisions such as minimum widths of street
in relation to heights of buildings in order to ensure adequate light and
ventilation.[citation_needed]
Much of Frederick_Law_Olmsted's work was concerned with urban design, and the
newly formed profession of landscape architecture also began to play a
significant role in the late 19th century.[3]
**** Modern urban design[edit] ****
Ebenezer_Howard's influential 1902 diagram, illustrating urban growth through
garden_city "off-shoots"
Urban_planning focuses on public health and urban design. Within the
discipline, modern urban design developed.
At the turn of the 20th century, planning and architecture underwent a paradigm
shift because of societal pressures. During this time, cities were
industrializing at a tremendous rate; private business largely dictated the
pace and style of this development. The expansion created many hardships for
the working_poor and concern for health and safety increased. However, the
laissez-faire style of government, in fashion for most of the Victorian_era,
was starting to give way to a New_Liberalism. This gave more power to the
public. The public wanted the government to provide citizens, especially
factory workers, with healthier environments. Around 1900, modern urban design
emerged from developing theories on how to mitigate the consequences of the
industrial_age.
The first modern urban planning theorist was Sir Ebenezer_Howard. His ideas,
although utopian, were adopted around the world because they were highly
practical. He initiated the garden city movement in 1898 garden_city_movement.
[4] His garden cities were intended to be planned, self-contained communities
surrounded by parks. Howard wanted the cities to be proportional with separate
areas of residences, industry, and agriculture. Inspired by the Utopian novel
Looking_Backward and Henry_George's work Progress_and_Poverty, Howard published
his book Garden_Cities_of_To-morrow in 1898. His work is an important reference
in the history of urban planning.[5] He envisioned the self-sufficient garden
city to house 32,000 people on a site 6,000 acres (2,428 ha). He planned on a
concentric pattern with open spaces, public parks, and six radial boulevards,
120 ft (37 m) wide, extending from the center. When it reached full population,
Howard wanted another garden city to be developed nearby. He envisaged a
cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 50,000
people, linked by road and rail.[6] His model for a garden city was first
created at Letchworth[7] and Welwyn_Garden_City in Hertfordshire. Howard's
movement was extended by Sir_Frederic_Osborn to regional planning.[8]
In the early 1900s, urban planning became professionalized. With input from
utopian visionaries, civil engineers, and local_councilors, new approaches to
city design were developed for consideration by decision makers such as elected
officials. In 1899, the Town_and_Country_Planning_Association was founded. In
1909, the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the University
of_Liverpool.[9] Urban planning was first officially embodied in the Housing
and_Town_Planning_Act_of_1909 Howard's âgarden cityâ compelled local
authorities to introduce a system where all housing construction conformed to
specific building standards.[10] In the United Kingdom following this Act,
surveyor, civil_engineers, architects, and lawyers began working together
within local_authorities. In 1910, Thomas_Adams became the first Town Planning
Inspector at the Local_Government_Board and began meeting with practitioners.
In 1914, The Town_Planning_Institute was established. The first urban planning
course in America wasnât established until 1924 at Harvard_University.
Professionals developed schemes for the development of land, transforming town
planning into a new area of expertise.
In the 20th century, urban planning was forever changed by the automobile
industry. Car oriented design impacted the rise of âurban designâ. City
layouts now had to revolve around roadways and traffic patterns. In 1956,
'Urban design' was first used at a series of conferences Harvard_University.
The event provided a platform for Harvard's Urban Design program. The program
also utilized the writings of famous urban planning thinkers: Gordon_Cullen,
Jane_Jacobs, Kevin_Lynch, and Christopher_Alexander.
In 1961, Gordon_Cullen published The Concise Townscape. He examined the
traditional artistic approach to city design of theorists including Camillo
Sitte, Barry Parker and Raymond_Unwin. Cullen also created the concept of
'serial vision'. It defined the urban landscape as a series of related spaces.
In 1961, Jane_Jacobs published ' The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities.
She critiqued the Modernism of CIAM (International Congresses of Modern
Architecture). Jacobs also claimed crime_rates in publicly owned spaces were
rising because of the Modernist approach of âcity in the parkâ. She argued
instead for an 'eyes on the street' approach to town planning through the
resurrection of main public space precedents (e.g. streets, squares).
In the same year, Kevin_Lynch published The Image of the City. He was seminal
to urban design, particularly with regards to the concept of legibility. He
reduced urban design theory to five basic elements: paths, districts, edges,
nodes, landmarks. He also made the use of mental maps to understanding the city
popular, rather than the two-dimensional physical master plans of the previous
50 years.
Other notable works:
Architecture of the City by Rossi (1966)
Learning from Las Vegas by Venturi (1972)
Collage City by Colin_Rowe(1978)
The Next American Metropolis by Peter_Calthorpe(1993)
The Social Logic of Space by Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson (1984)
The popularity of these works resulted in terms that become everyday language
in the field of urban planning. Aldo Rossi introduced 'historicism' and
'collective memory' to urban design. Rossi also proposed a 'collage metaphor'
to understand the collection of new and old forms within the same urban space.
Peter Calthorpe developed a manifesto for sustainable urban living via medium
density living. He also designed a manual for building new settlements in his
concept of Transit_Oriented_Development (TOD). Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson
introduced Space_Syntax to predict how movement patterns in cities would
contribute to urban vitality, anti-social behaviour and economic success.
'Sustainability', 'livability', and 'high quality of urban components' also
became commonplace in the field.

Urban design seeks to create sustainable_urban environments with long-lasting
structures, buildings and overall livability. Walkable urbanism is another
approach to practice that is defined within the Charter of New_Urbanism. It
aims to reduce environmental impacts by altering the built environment to
create smart cities that support sustainable_transport.[1] Compact urban
neighborhoods encourage residents to drive less. These neighborhoods have
significantly lower environmental impacts when compared to sprawling suburbs.
[11] To prevent urban sprawl, Circular_flow_land_use_management was introduced
in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns.
As a result of the recent New_Classical_Architecture movement, sustainable
construction aims to develop smart_growth, walkability, architectural
tradition, and classical_design.[12][13] It contrasts from modernist and
globally_uniform architecture. In the 1980s, urban design began to oppose the
increasing solitary housing_estates and suburban_sprawl.[14]
***** Principles[edit] *****
L'Enfant's plan for Washington DC
Gehl Architects' project for Brighton New Road employing shared space
Urban_planners frequently act as urban designers when preparing design
guidelines, regulatory frameworks, legislation, and advertising. Urban planners
also work in urban design with architects, landscape_architects, transportation
engineers and industrial_designers. They must also deal with âplace
managementâ to guide and assist the use and maintenance of urban areas and
public spaces. Public agencies, authorities, and the interests of nearby
property owners manage public spaces. Users often compete over the spaces and
negotiate across a variety of spheres. Input is frequently needed from a wide
range of stakeholders.
While there are some professionals who identify themselves specifically as
urban designers, a majority have backgrounds in urban_planning, architecture,
or landscape_architecture. Many collegiate programs incorporate urban design
theory and design subjects into their curricula. There are an increasing number
of university programs offering degrees in urban design at the post-graduate
level.
Urban design considers:
    * Pedestrian_zones
    * Incorporation_of_nature_within_a_city
    * Aesthetics
    * Urban_structure â arrangement and relation of business and people
    * Urban_typology, density and sustainability - spatial types and
      morphologies related to intensity of use, consumption of resources and
      production and maintenance of viable communities
    * Accessibility â safe and easy transportation
    * Legibility and wayfinding â accessible information about travel and
      destinations
    * Animation â Designing places to stimulate public activity
    * Function and fit â places support their varied intended uses
    * Complementary mixed_uses â Locating activities to allow constructive
      interaction between them
    * Character and meaning â Recognizing differences between places
    * Order and incident â Balancing consistency and variety in the urban
      environment
    * Continuity and change â Locating people in time and place, respecting
      heritage and contemporary culture
    * Civil_society â people are free to interact as civic equals, important
      for building social_capital

***** Equality issues[edit] *****
Until the 1970s, the design of towns and cities took little account of the
needs of people_with_disabilities. At that time, disabled people began to form
movements demanding recognition of their potential contribution if social
obstacles were removed. Disabled people challenged the 'medical model' of
disability which saw physical and mental problems as an individual 'tragedy'
and people with disabilities as 'brave' for enduring them. They proposed
instead a 'social model' which said that barriers to disabled people result
from the design of the built_environment and attitudes of able-bodied people.
'Access Groups' were established composed of people with disabilities who
audited their local areas, checked planning applications and made
representations for improvements. The new profession of 'access officer' was
established around that time to produce guidelines based on the recommendations
of access groups and to oversee adaptations to existing buildings as well as to
check on the accessibility of new proposals. Many local_authorities now employ
access officers who are regulated by the Access Association. A new chapter of
the Building Regulations (Part M) was introduced in 1992. Although it was
beneficial to have legislation on this issue the requirements were fairly
minimal but continue to be improved with ongoing amendments. The Disability
Discrimination_Act_1995 continues to raise awareness and enforce action on
disability issues in the urban environment.
