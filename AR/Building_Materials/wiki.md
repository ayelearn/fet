Building material is any material which is used for construction purposes. Many
naturally occurring substances, such as clay, rocks, sand, and wood, even twigs
and leaves, have been used to construct buildings. Apart from naturally
occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, some more and some less
synthetic. The manufacturing of building materials is an established industry
in many countries and the use of these materials is typically segmented into
specific specialty trades, such as carpentry, insulation, plumbing, and roofing
work. They provide the make-up of habitats and structures including homes.[1]

***** The total cost of building materials[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (April
         2014)
In history there are trends in building materials from being natural to
becoming more man-made and composite; biodegradable to imperishable; indigenous
(local) to being transported globally; repairable to disposable; chosen for
increased levels of fire-safety, and improved seismic resistance.. These trends
tend to increase the initial and long term economic, ecological, energy, and
social costs of building materials.
**** Economic costs[edit] ****
Initial economic cost of building materials is the purchase price. This is
often what governs decision making about what materials to use. Sometimes
people take into consideration the energy savings or durability of the
materials and see the value of paying a higher initial cost in return for a
lower lifetime cost. For example, an asphalt shingle roof costs less than a
metal roof to install, but the metal roof will last longer so the lifetime cost
is less per year. Some materials may require more care than others, maintaining
costs specific to some materials may also influence the final decision. Risks
when considering lifetime cost of a material is if the building is damaged such
as by fire or wind, or if the material is not as durable as advertised. The
cost of materials should be taken into consideration to bear the risk to buy
combustive materials to enlarge the lifetime. It is said that, 'if it must be
done, it must be done well'.
**** Ecological costs[edit] ****
Main article: Ecological_footprint
Pollution costs can be macro and micro. The macro, environmental pollution of
extraction industries building materials rely on such as mining, petroleum, and
logging produce environmental damage at their source and in transportation of
the raw materials, manufacturing, transportation of the products, retailing,
and installation. An example of the micro aspect of pollution is the off-
gassing of the building materials in the building or indoor_air_pollution. Red
List_building_materials are materials found to be harmful. Also the carbon
footprint, the total set of greenhouse gas emissions produced in the life of
the material. A life-cycle_analysis also includes the reuse, recycling, or
disposal of construction_waste. Two concepts in building which account for the
ecological_economics of building materials are green_building and sustainable
development.
**** Energy costs[edit] ****
the Initial energy costs include the amount of energy consumed to produce,
deliver and install the material. The long term energy cost is the economic,
ecological, and social costs of continuing to produce and deliver energy to the
building for its use, maintenance, and eventual removal. The initial embodied
energy of a structure is the energy consumed to extract, manufacture, deliver,
install, the materials. The lifetime embodied energy continues to grow with the
use, maintenance, and reuse/recycling/disposal of the building materials
themselves and how the materials and design help minimize the life-time energy
consumption of the structure.
**** Social costs[edit] ****
Social costs are injury and health of the people producing and transporting the
materials and potential health problems of the building occupants if there are
problems with the building_biology. Globalization has had significant impacts
on people both in terms of jobs, skills, and self-sufficiency are lost when
manufacturing facilities are closed and the cultural aspects of where new
facilities are opened. Aspects of fair_trade and labor_rights are social costs
of global building material manufacturing.
***** Naturally occurring substances[edit] *****
**** Brush[edit] ****
A group of Mohaves in a brush hut
Brush structures are built entirely from plant parts and were used in primitive
cultures such as Native Americans and [2] pygmy_peoples in Africa[3] These are
built mostly with branches, twigs and leaves, and bark, similar to a beaver's
lodge. These were variously named wikiups, lean-tos, and so forth.
An extension on the brush building idea is the wattle_and_daub process in which
clay soils or dung, usually cow, are used to fill in and cover a woven brush
structure. This gives the structure more thermal mass and strength. Wattle and
daub is one of the oldest building techniques.[4] Many older timber frame
buildings incorporate wattle and daub as non load bearing walls between the
timber frames.
**** Ice and snow[edit] ****
Snow and occasionally ice,[5] were used by the Inuit peoples for igloos and
snow is used to build a shelter called a quinzhee. Ice has also been used for
ice_hotels as a tourist_attraction in northern climates.[6]
**** Mud and clay[edit] ****
Sod buildings in Iceland
Clay based buildings usually come in two distinct types. One being when the
walls are made directly with the mud mixture, and the other being walls built
by stacking air-dried building blocks called mud_bricks.
Other uses of clay in building is combined with straws to create light_clay,
wattle_and_daub, and mud plaster.
*** Wet-laid clay walls[edit] ***
Main articles: rammed_earth, sod, and cob_(building)
Wet-laid, or damp, walls are made by using the mud or clay mixture directly
without forming blocks and drying them first. The amount of and type of each
material in the mixture used leads to different styles of buildings. The
deciding factor is usually connected with the quality of the soil being used.
Larger amounts of clay are usually employed in building with cob, while low-
clay soil is usually associated with sod_house or sod_roof construction. The
other main ingredients include more or less sand/gravel and straw/grasses.
Rammed earth is both an old and newer take on creating walls, once made by
compacting clay soils between planks by hand; nowadays forms and mechanical
pneumatic compressors are used.[7]
Soil, and especially clay, provides good thermal_mass; it is very good at
keeping temperatures at a constant level. Homes built with earth tend to be
naturally cool in the summer heat and warm in cold weather. Clay holds heat or
cold, releasing it over a period of time like stone. Earthen walls change
temperature slowly, so artificially raising or lowering the temperature can use
more resources than in say a wood built house, but the heat/coolness stays
longer.[7]
People building with mostly dirt and clay, such as cob, sod, and adobe, created
homes that have been built for centuries in western and northern Europe, Asia,
as well as the rest of the world, and continue to be built, though on a smaller
scale. Some of these buildings have remained habitable for hundreds of years.
[8][9]
*** Structural clay blocks and bricks[edit] ***
Main articles: adobe, mudbrick, and compressed_earth_block
Mud-bricks, also known by their Spanish name adobe are ancient building
materials with evidence dating back thousands of years BC. Compressed earth
blocks are a more modern type of brick used for building more frequently in
industrialized_society since the building blocks can be manufactured off site
in a centralized location at a brickworks and transported to multiple building
locations. These blocks can also be monetized more easily and sold.
Structural mud bricks are almost always made using clay, often clay soil and a
binder are the only ingredients used, but other ingredients can include sand,
lime, concrete, stone and other binders. The formed or compressed block is then
air dried and can be laid dry or with a mortar or clay_slip.
**** Sand[edit] ****
Sand is used with cement, and sometimes lime, to make mortar for masonry work
and plaster. Sand is also used as a part of the concrete mix. An important low-
cost building material in countries with high sand content soils is the
Sandcrete block, which is weaker but cheaper than fired clay bricks.[10]
**** Stone or rock[edit] ****
Rock structures have existed for as long as history can recall. It is the
longest lasting building material available, and is usually readily available.
There are many types of rock throughout the world, all with differing
attributes that make them better or worse for particular uses. Rock is a very
dense material so it gives a lot of protection too; its main drawback as a
material is its weight and awkwardness. Its energy_density is also considered a
big drawback, as stone is hard to keep warm without using large amounts of
heating resources.
Dry-stone_walls have been built for as long as humans have put one stone on top
of another. Eventually, different forms of mortar were used to hold the stones
together, cement being the most commonplace now.
The granite-strewn uplands of Dartmoor National Park, United Kingdom, for
example, provided ample resources for early settlers. Circular huts were
constructed from loose granite rocks throughout the Neolithic and early Bronze
Age, and the remains of an estimated 5,000 can still be seen today. Granite
continued to be used throughout the Medieval period (see Dartmoor_longhouse)
and into modern times. Slate is another stone type, commonly used as roofing
material in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world where it is found.
Stone buildings can be seen in most major cities; some civilizations built
entirely with stone such as the Egyptian and Aztec pyramids and the structures
of the Inca civilization.
**** Thatch[edit] ****
Toda tribe hut
Thatch is one of the oldest of building materials known, Thatch is another word
for grass; grass is a good insulator and easily harvested. Many African tribes
have lived in homes made completely of grasses and sand year-round. In Europe,
thatch roofs on homes were once prevalent but the material fell out of favor as
industrialization and improved transport increased the availability of other
materials. Today, though, the practice is undergoing a revival. In the
Netherlands, for instance, many new buildings have thatched roofs with special
ridge tiles on top.
**** Wood and timber[edit] ****

Poland (2012).
Wood has been used as a building material for thousands of years in its natural
state. Today, engineered_wood is becoming very common in industrialized
countries.
Wood is a product of trees, and sometimes other fibrous plants, used for
construction purposes when cut or pressed into lumber and timber, such as
boards, planks and similar materials. It is a generic building material and is
used in building just about any type of structure in most climates. Wood can be
very flexible under loads, keeping strength while bending, and is incredibly
strong when compressed vertically. There are many differing qualities to the
different types of wood, even among same tree species. This means specific
species are better suited for various uses than others. And growing_conditions
are important for deciding quality.
"Timber" is the term used for construction purposes except the term "lumber" is
used in the United States. Raw wood (a log, trunk, bole) becomes timber when
the wood has been "converted" (sawn, hewn, split) in the forms of minimally-
processed_logs_stacked_on_top_of_each_other, timber_frame construction, and
light-frame_construction. The main problems with timber structures are fire
risk and moisture-related problems.[citation_needed]
In modern times softwood is used as a lower-value bulk material, whereas
hardwood is usually used for finishings and furniture. Historically timber
frame structures were built with oak in western Europe, recently douglas_fir
has become the most popular wood for most types of structural building.
Many families or communities, in rural areas, have a personal woodlot from
which the family or community will grow and harvest trees to build with or
sell. These lots are tended to like a garden. This was much more prevalent in
pre-industrial times, when laws existed as to the amount of wood one could cut
at any one time to ensure there would be a supply of timber for the future, but
is still a viable form of agriculture.
***** Man-made substances[edit] *****
**** Fired bricks and clay blocks[edit] ****
A pile of fired bricks.
Clay blocks (sometimes called clay block brick) being laid with an adhesive
rather than mortar
Bricks are made in a similar way to mud-bricks except without the fibrous
binder such as straw and are fired ("burned" in a brick_clamp or kiln) after
they have air-dried to permanently harden them. Kiln fired clay bricks are a
ceramic material. Fired bricks can be solid or have hollow cavities to aid in
drying and make them lighter and easier to transport. The individual bricks are
placed upon each other in courses using mortar. Successive courses being used
to build up walls, arches, and other architectural elements. Fired brick walls
are usually substantially thinner than cob/adobe while keeping the same
vertical strength. They require more energy to create but are easier to
transport and store, and are lighter than stone blocks. Romans extensively used
fired brick of a shape and type now called Roman_bricks.[11] Building with
brick gained much popularity in the mid-18th century and 19th centuries. This
was due to lower costs with increases in brick [12] manufacturing and fire-
safety in the ever crowding cities.
The cinder_block supplemented or replaced fired bricks in the late 20th century
often being used for the inner parts of masonry walls and by themselves.
Structural_clay_tiles (clay blocks) are clay or terracotta and typically are
perforated with holes.
**** Cement composites[edit] ****
Cement bonded composites are made of hydrated cement paste that binds wood,
particles, or fibers to make pre-cast building components. Various fiberous
materials, including paper, fiberglass, and carbon-fiber have been used as
binders.
Wood and natural fibers are composed of various soluble organic compounds like
carbohydrates, glycosides and phenolics. These compounds are known to retard
cement setting. Therefore, before using a wood in making cement bonded
composites, its compatibility with cement is assessed.
Wood-cement compatibility is the ratio of a parameter related to the property
of a wood-cement composite to that of a neat cement paste. The compatibility is
often expressed as a percentage value. To determine wood-cement compatibility,
methods based on different properties are used, such as, hydration
characteristics, strength, interfacial bond and morphology. Various methods are
used by researchers such as the measurement of hydration characteristics of a
cement-aggregate mix;[13][14][15] the comparison of the mechanical properties
of cement-aggregate mixes[16][17] and the visual assessment of microstructural
properties of the wood-cement mixes.[18] It has been found that the hydration
test by measuring the change in hydration temperature with time is the most
convenient method. Recently, Karade et al.[19] have reviewed these methods of
compatibility assessment and suggested a method based on the âmaturity
conceptâ i.e. taking in consideration both time and temperature of cement
hydration reaction.
Bricks were laid in lime_mortar from the time of the Romans until supplanted by
Portland cement mortar in the early 20th century. Cement_blocks also sometimes
are filled with grout or covered with a parge_coat.
**** Concrete[edit] ****
Falkirk_Wheel
Concrete is a composite building material made from the combination of
aggregate and a binder such as cement. The most common form of concrete is
Portland cement concrete, which consists of mineral aggregate (generally gravel
and sand), portland_cement and water.
After mixing, the cement hydrates and eventually hardens into a stone-like
material. When used in the generic sense, this is the material referred to by
the term "concrete".
For a concrete construction of any size, as concrete has a rather low tensile
strength, it is generally strengthened using steel rods or bars (known as
rebars). This strengthened concrete is then referred to as reinforced_concrete.
In order to minimise any air bubbles, that would weaken the structure, a
vibrator is used to eliminate any air that has been entrained when the liquid
concrete mix is poured around the ironwork. Concrete has been the predominant
building material in the modern age due to its longevity, formability, and ease
of transport. Recent advancements, such as insulating_concrete_forms, combine
the concrete forming and other construction steps (installation of insulation).
All materials must be taken in required proportions as described in standards.
**** Fabric[edit] ****
The tent is the home of choice among nomadic groups all over the world. Two
well-known types include the conical teepee and the circular yurt. The tent has
been revived as a major construction technique with the development of tensile
architecture and synthetic fabrics. Modern buildings can be made of flexible
material such as fabric membranes, and supported by a system of steel cables,
rigid or internal, or by air pressure.
**** Foam[edit] ****

Toronto.
Recently, synthetic polystyrene or polyurethane foam has been used in
combination with structural materials, such as concrete. It is lightweight,
easily shaped, and an excellent insulator. Foam is usually used as part of a
structural_insulated_panel, wherein the foam is sandwiched between wood or
cement or insulating concrete forms.
**** Glass[edit] ****
Glassmaking is considered an art form as well as an industrial process or
material.
Clear windows have been used since the invention of glass to cover small
openings in a building. Glass panes provided humans with the ability to both
let light into rooms while at the same time keeping inclement weather outside.
Glass is generally made from mixtures of sand and silicates, in a very hot fire
stove called a kiln, and is very brittle. Additives are often included the
mixture used to produce glass with shades of colors or various characteristics
(such as bulletproof_glass or lightbulbs.
The use of glass in architectural buildings has become very popular in the
modern culture. Glass "curtain_walls" can be used to cover the entire facade of
a building, or it can be used to span over a wide roof structure in a "space
frame". These uses though require some sort of frame to hold sections of glass
together, as glass by itself is too brittle and would require an overly large
kiln to be used to span such large areas by itself.
Glass_bricks were invented in the early 20th century.
**** Gypcrete[edit] ****
Gypcrete is a mixture of gypsum plaster and fibreglass rovings. Although
plaster and fibres fiborous_plaster have been used for many years, especially
for ceilings, it was not until the early 1990s that serious studies of the
strength and qualities of a walling system Rapidwall, using a mixture of gypsum
plaster and 300mm plus fibreglass rovings, were investigated. It was
discovered, through testing at the University_of_Adelaide, that these walls had
significant, load_bearing, shear and lateral resistance together with
earthquake-resistance, fire-resistance, and thermal properties. With an
abundance of gypsum (naturally occurring and by-product chemical FGD and
phospho gypsums) available worldwide, gypcrete-based building products, which
are fully recyclable, offer significant environmental benefits.
**** Metal[edit] ****
Metal is used as structural framework for larger buildings such as skyscrapers,
or as an external surface covering. There are many types of metals used for
building. Metal figures quite prominently in prefabricated structures such as
the Quonset_hut, and can be seen used in most cosmopolitan cities. It requires
a great deal of human labor to produce metal, especially in the large amounts
needed for the building industries. Corrosion is metal's prime enemy when it
comes to longevity.
    * Steel is a metal alloy whose major component is iron, and is the usual
      choice for metal structural building materials. It is strong, flexible,
      and if refined well and/or treated lasts a long time.
    * The lower density and better corrosion resistance of aluminium alloys and
      tin sometimes overcome their greater cost.
Copper belfry of St. Laurentius church, Bad_Neuenahr-Ahrweiler
    * Copper is a valued building material because of its advantageous
      properties (see: Copper_in_architecture). These include corrosion
      resistance, durability, low thermal movement, light weight, radio
      frequency shielding, lightning protection, sustainability, recyclability,
      and a wide range of finishes. Copper is incorporated into roofing,
      flashing, gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, wall cladding,
      building expansion joints, and indoor design elements.
    * Other metals used include chrome, gold, silver, and titanium. Titanium
      can be used for structural purposes, but it is much more expensive than
      steel. Chrome, gold, and silver are used as decoration, because these
      materials are expensive and lack structural qualities such as tensile
      strength or hardness.
**** Plastics[edit] ****

building
The term "plastics" covers a range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic
condensation or polymerization products that can be molded or extruded into
objects, films, or fibers. Their name is derived from the fact that in their
semi-liquid state they are malleable, or have the property of plasticity.
Plastics vary immensely in heat tolerance, hardness, and resiliency. Combined
with this adaptability, the general uniformity of composition and lightness of
plastics ensures their use in almost all industrial applications today. High
performance_plastics such as ETFE have become an ideal building material due to
its high abrasion resistance and chemical inertness. Notable buildings that
feature it include: the Beijing_National_Aquatics_Center and the Eden_Project
biomes.[20]
**** Papers and membranes[edit] ****
Building papers and membranes are used for many reasons in construction. One of
the oldest building papers is red_rosin_paper which was known to be in use
before 1850 and was used as an underlayment in exterior walls, roofs, and
floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. Tar_paper was invented
late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper and
for gravel_roofs. Tar paper has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt
felt_paper. Felt paper has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic
underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by
housewraps.
There are a wide variety of damp_proofing and waterproofing membranes used for
roofing, basement_waterproofing, and geomembranes.
**** Ceramics[edit] ****
Fired clay bricks have been used since the time of the Romans. Special tiles
are used for roofing, siding, flooring, ceilings, pipes, flue liners, and more.
***** Building products[edit] *****
In the market_place the term "building products" often refers to ready-made
particles/sections, made from various materials, that are fitted in
architectural hardware and decorative hardware parts of a building. The list of
building products excludes the building materials used to construct the
building architecture and supporting fixtures, like windows, doors, cabinets,
etc. Building products, rather, support and make building materials work in a
modular fashion.
"Building products" may also refer to items used to put such hardware together,
such as caulking, glues, paint, and anything else bought for the purpose of
constructing a building.
***** Sustainability[edit] *****
In 2017, the buildings and construction together consumed 36% of the final
energy produced globally while being responsible for 39% of the global energy
related CO2_emissions[21]. The shares from construction industry alone were 6%
and 11% respectively. Energy consumption during the building-material
production, predominantly due to their use of electricity, is a dominant
contributor to the construction industry's share. Embodied_energy of relevant
building materials in the US are provided in the table below.
