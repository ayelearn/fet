The exact number of candies in this jar cannot be determined by looking at it,
because most of the candies are not visible. The amount can be estimated by
presuming that the portion of the jar that cannot be seen contains an amount
equivalent to the amount contained in the same volume for the portion that can
be seen.
Estimation (or estimating) is the process of finding an estimate, or
approximation, which is a value that is usable for some purpose even if input
data may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable. The value is nonetheless usable
because it is derived from the best information available.[1] Typically,
estimation involves "using the value of a statistic derived from a sample to
estimate the value of a corresponding population parameter".[2] The sample
provides information that can be projected, through various formal or informal
processes, to determine a range most likely to describe the missing
information. An estimate that turns out to be incorrect will be an overestimate
if the estimate exceeded the actual result,[3] and an underestimate if the
estimate fell short of the actual result.[4] (Contrast with prediction.)

***** How estimation is done[edit] *****
Estimation is often done by sampling, which is counting a small number of
examples something, and projecting that number onto a larger population.[1] An
example of estimation would be determining how many candies of a given size are
in a glass jar. Because the distribution of candies inside the jar may vary,
the observer can count the number of candies visible through the glass,
consider the size of the jar, and presume that a similar distribution can be
found in the parts that can not be seen, thereby making an estimate of the
total number of candies that could be in the jar if that presumption were true.
Estimates can similarly be generated by projecting results from polls or
surveys onto the entire population.
In making an estimate, the goal is often most useful to generate a range of
possible outcomes that is precise enough to be useful, but not so precise that
it is likely to be inaccurate.[2] For example, in trying to guess the number of
candies in the jar, if fifty were visible, and the total volume of the jar
seemed to be about twenty times as large as the volume containing the visible
candies, then one might simply project that there were a thousand candies in
the jar. Such a projection, intended to pick the single value that is believed
to be closest to the actual value, is called a point_estimate.[2] However, a
point estimation is likely to be incorrect, because the sample sizeâin this
case, the number of candies that are visibleâis too small a number to be sure
that it does not contain anomalies that differ from the population as a whole.
[2] A corresponding concept is an interval_estimate, which captures a much
larger range of possibilities, but is too broad to be useful.[2] For example,
if one were asked to estimate the percentage of people who like candy, it would
clearly be correct that the number falls between zero and one hundred percent.
[2] Such an estimate would provide no guidance, however, to somebody who is
trying to determine how many candies to buy for a party to be attended by a
hundred people.
***** Uses of estimation[edit] *****
In mathematics, approximation describes the process of finding estimates in the
form of upper or lower bounds for a quantity that cannot readily be evaluated
precisely, and approximation_theory deals with finding simpler functions that
are close to some complicated function and that can provide useful estimates.
In statistics, an estimator is the formal name for the rule by which an
estimate is calculated from data, and estimation_theory deals with finding
estimates with good properties. This process is used in signal_processing, for
approximating an unobserved signal on the basis of an observed signal
containing noise. For estimation of yet-to-be observed quantities, forecasting
and prediction are applied. A Fermi_problem, in physics, is one concerning
estimation in problems which typically involve making justified guesses about
quantities that seem impossible to compute given limited available information.
Estimation is important in business and economics, because too many variables
exist to figure out how large-scale activities will develop. Estimation_in
project_planning can be particularly significant, because plans for the
distribution of labor and for purchases of raw materials must be made, despite
the inability to know every possible problem that may come up. A certain amount
of resources will be available for carrying out a particular project, making it
important to obtain or generate a cost_estimate as one of the vital elements of
entering into the project.[5] The U.S._Government_Accountability_Office defines
a cost estimate as, "the summation of individual cost elements, using
established methods and valid data, to estimate the future costs of a program,
based on what is known today", and reports that "realistic cost estimating was
imperative when making wise decisions in acquiring new systems".[6]
Furthermore, project plans must not underestimate the needs of the project,
which can result in delays while unmet needs are fulfilled, nor must they
greatly overestimate the needs of the project, or else the unneeded resources
may go to waste.
An informal estimate when little information is available is called a
guesstimate, because the inquiry becomes closer to purely guessing the answer.
The "estimated"_sign, â®, is used to designate that package contents are close
to the nominal contents.
