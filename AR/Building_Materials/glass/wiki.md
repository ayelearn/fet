This article is about the material. For other uses, see Glass_(disambiguation).
A jar made of soda-lime glass. Although transparent in thin sections, the glass
is greenish-blue in thick sections from impurities. Bubbles remained trapped in
the glass as it cooled from a liquid, through the glass transition, becoming a
non-crystalline solid.
The joining of two tubes made of lead_glass during glass_welding.
Glass is a non-crystalline, amorphous_solid (neither defined as a solid or a
liquid) that is often transparent and has widespread practical, technological,
and decorative uses in, for example, window panes, tableware, and
optoelectronics. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of
manufactured glass are "silicate glasses" based on the chemical compound silica
(silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. The term glass,
in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which
is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles. Of the many silica-
based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a
specific type called soda-lime_glass, composed of approximately 75% silicon
dioxide (SiO2), sodium_oxide (Na2O) from sodium_carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium
oxide_(CaO), also called lime, and several minor additives.
Many applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency,
giving rise to their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, reflect
and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to
make optical_lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical_fibers for high speed
data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and
can also be painted and printed with vitreous_enamels. These qualities have led
to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art_objects and in
particular, stained_glass_windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is
extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-
making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has
been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking
glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights,
marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass_fiber and matted as glass_wool in a
way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass
fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural
reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects
historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply
called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.
Scientifically, "glass" is often defined in a broader sense, encompassing every
solid that possesses a non-crystalline (that is, amorphous) structure at the
atomic scale and that exhibits a glass_transition when heated towards the
liquid state. Porcelains and many polymer thermoplastics familiar from everyday
use are glasses. These sorts of glasses can be made of quite different kinds of
materials than silica: metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous_solutions,
molecular liquids, and polymers. For many applications, like glass_bottles or
eyewear, polymer glasses (acrylic_glass, polycarbonate or polyethylene
terephthalate) are a lighter alternative than traditional glass.

***** Silicate glass[edit] *****
**** Ingredients[edit] ****
Silicon_dioxide (SiO2) is a common fundamental constituent of glass.[1] In
nature, vitrification of quartz occurs when lightning strikes sand, forming
hollow, branching_rootlike structures called fulgurites.[2]
Fused_quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure silica. It has excellent
resistance to thermal_shock, being able to survive immersion in water while red
hot. However, its high melting temperature (1723 Â°C) and viscosity make it
difficult to work with.[3] Normally, other substances are added to simplify
processing. One is sodium_carbonate (Na2CO3, "soda"), which lowers the glass-
transition temperature. The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is
usually undesirable, so lime (CaO, calcium_oxide, generally obtained from
limestone), some magnesium_oxide (MgO) and aluminium_oxide (Al2O3) are added to
provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70
to 74% silica by weight and is called a soda-lime_glass.[4] Soda-lime glasses
account for about 90% of manufactured glass.[5][6]
Most common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties. Lead
glass or flint_glass is more "brilliant" because the increased refractive_index
causes noticeably more specular_reflection and increased optical_dispersion.
Adding barium also increases the refractive index. Thorium_oxide gives glass a
high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing
high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by
lanthanum_oxide in modern eyeglasses.[7] Iron can be incorporated into glass to
absorb infrared radiation, for example in heat-absorbing filters for movie
projectors, while cerium(IV)_oxide can be used for glass that absorbs
ultraviolet wavelengths.[8]
The following is a list of the more common types of silicate glasses and their
ingredients, properties, and applications:
    * Fused quartz,[9] also called fused-silica glass,[10] vitreous-silica
      glass: silica (SiO2) in vitreous, or glass, form (i.e., its molecules are
      disordered and random, without crystalline structure). It has very low
      thermal expansion, is very hard, and resists high temperatures
      (1000â1500 Â°C). It is also the most resistant against weathering
      (caused in other glasses by alkali ions leaching out of the glass, while
      staining it). Fused quartz is used for high-temperature applications such
      as furnace tubes, lighting tubes, melting crucibles, etc.[11]
    * Soda-lime-silica glass, window glass:[12] silica + sodium oxide (Na2O) +
      lime (CaO) + magnesia (MgO) + alumina (Al2O3).[13][14] Is transparent,
      [15] easily formed and most suitable for window glass (see flat_glass).
      [16] It has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat[15]
      (500â600 Â°C).[11] It is used for windows, some low-temperature
      incandescent light bulbs, and tableware.[17] Container_glass is a soda-
      lime glass that is a slight variation on flat glass, which uses more
      alumina and calcium, and less sodium and magnesium, which are more water-
      soluble. This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.
    * Sodium borosilicate glass, Pyrex: silica + boron_trioxide (B2O3) + soda
      (Na2O) + alumina (Al2O3).[18] Stands heat expansion much better than
      window glass.[10] Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car head
      lamps, etc. Borosilicate_glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) have as main
      constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low coefficients
      of_thermal_expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25Ã10â6/Â°C[19] as compared
      to about 9Ã10â6/Â°C for a typical soda-lime glass[20]), making them
      more dimensionally stable. The lower coefficient of thermal expansion
      (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal_expansion,
      thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal_shock. They are commonly
      used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.
    * Lead-oxide glass, crystal glass,[11] lead glass:[21] silica + lead oxide
      (PbO) + potassium oxide (K2O) + soda (Na2O) + zinc oxide (ZnO) + alumina.
      Because of its high density (resulting in a high electron density), it
      has a high refractive index, making the look of glassware more brilliant
      [22] (called "crystal", though of course it is a glass and not a
      crystal). It also has a high elasticity, making glassware "ring". It is
      also more workable in the factory, but cannot stand heating very well.
      [11] This kind of glass is also more fragile than other glasses[23] and
      is easier to cut.[22]
    * Aluminosilicate glass: silica + alumina + lime + magnesia[24] + barium
      oxide (BaO)[11] + boric oxide (B2O3).[24] Extensively used for
      fiberglass,[24] used for making glass-reinforced plastics (boats, fishing
      rods, etc.) and for halogen bulb glass.[11] Aluminosilicate glasses are
      also resistant to weathering and water erosion.[25]
    * Germanium-oxide glass: alumina + germanium_dioxide (GeO2). Extremely
      clear glass, used for fiber-optic waveguides in communication networks.
      [26] Light loses only 5% of its intensity through 1 km of glass fiber.
      [11]
Another common glass ingredient is crushed alkali glass or 'cullet' ready for
recycled_glass. The recycled glass saves on raw materials and energy.
Impurities in the cullet can lead to product and equipment failure. Fining
agents such as sodium_sulfate, sodium_chloride, or antimony_oxide may be added
to reduce the number of air bubbles in the glass mixture.[4] Glass_batch
calculation is the method by which the correct raw material mixture is
determined to achieve the desired glass composition.[27]

      Bohemia
    * Tube fulgurites
    * Quartz_sand (silica) is the main raw material in commercial glass
      production
    * Trinitite, a glass made by the Trinity_nuclear-weapon_test
    * Lead_glass, a glass made by adding lead_oxide to glass
    * A borosilicate_glass guitar_slide
***** Physical properties[edit] *****
See also: List_of_physical_properties_of_glass
**** Optical properties[edit] ****
Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions
that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials
do not generally transmit visible light.[28] The individual crystallites may be
transparent, but their facets (grain_boundaries) reflect or scatter light
resulting in diffuse_reflection. Glass does not contain the internal
subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does
not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface
of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the
supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and
can follow surface_tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface.
These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass
is partially light-absorbing, i.e., colored.[29]
Glass has the ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light following
geometrical_optics,[30] without scattering it (due to the absence of grain
boundaries).[31] It is used in the manufacture of lenses and windows.[32]
Common glass has a refraction_index around 1.5.[33] This may be modified by
adding low-density materials[34] such as boron, which lowers the index of
refraction (see crown_glass),[35] or increased (to as much as 1.8) with high-
density materials such as (classically) lead oxide (see flint_glass and lead
glass), or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of zirconium, titanium, or barium.
These high-index glasses (inaccurately known as "crystal" when used in glass
vessels) cause more chromatic dispersion of light, and are prized for their
diamond-like optical properties.
According to Fresnel_equations, the reflectivity of a sheet of glass is about
4% per surface (at normal incidence in air),[36] and the transmissivity of one
element (two surfaces) is about 90%.[37] Glass with high germanium oxide
content also finds application in optoelectronics[38]âe.g., for light-
transmitting optical_fibers.[39]

    * Strand of optical glass_fiber
**** Other properties[edit] ****
In the manufacturing process, silicate glass can be poured, formed, extruded
and molded into forms ranging from flat sheets to highly intricate shapes.[40]
The finished product is brittle[41] and will fracture, unless laminated or
specially treated,[42] but is extremely durable under most conditions.[43] It
erodes very slowly[44] and can mostly withstand the action of water.[45] It is
mostly resistant to chemical attack,[46] does not react with foods, and is an
ideal material for the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs and most
chemicals.[47] Glass is also a fairly inert substance.[48]
*** Corrosion[edit] ***
Main article: Corrosion_Â§ Corrosion_of_glass
Although glass is generally corrosion-resistant[49] and more corrosion
resistant than other materials, it still can be corroded.[43] The materials
that make up a particular glass composition have an effect on how quickly the
glass corrodes.[46] A glass containing a high proportion of alkalis[50] or
alkali earths is less corrosion-resistant than other kinds of glasses.[51]
Glass_flakes have applications as anti-corrosive coating.[52]
*** Strength[edit] ***
Main article: Strength_of_glass
Glass typically has a tensile_strength of 7 megapascals (1,000 psi),[53]
however theoretically it can have a strength of 17 gigapascals (2,500,000 psi)
due to glass's strong chemical bonds. Several factors such as imperfections
like scratches and bubbles[54] and the glass's chemical composition impact the
tensile strength of glass.[55] Several processes such as toughening can
increase the strength of glass.[56]
***** Contemporary production[edit] *****
Main articles: Glass_production, Float_glass, Flat_glass, Glassblowing, and
Glazier
Following the glass_batch preparation and mixing, the raw materials are
transported to the furnace. Soda-lime_glass for mass_production is melted in
gas_fired_units. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric
melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks.[4] After melting, homogenization and
refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is formed. Flat_glass for windows and
similar applications is formed by the float_glass process, developed between
1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair_Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's
Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten
tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of
gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure
to obtain a polished finish.[57] Container_glass for common bottles and jars is
formed by blowing_and_pressing methods.[58] This glass is often slightly
modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water
resistance. Further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table Glass
forming_techniques.
Once the desired form is obtained, glass is usually annealed for the removal of
stresses and to increase the glass's hardness and durability.[59] Surface
treatments, coatings or lamination may follow to improve the chemical
durability (glass_container_coatings, glass_container_internal_treatment),
strength (toughened_glass, bulletproof_glass, windshields[60]), or optical
properties (insulated_glazing, anti-reflective_coating).[61]
    * Impurities give the glass its color
    * Transparent and opaque examples
    * Glass can be blown into an infinite number of shapes
**** Color[edit] ****
Main article: Glass_coloring_and_color_marking
Some of the many color possibilities of glass
Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or
color_centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of
finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic_glasses).[62] Ordinary
soda-lime_glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although
iron(II)_oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt%[63] produce a green tint,
which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments.
Further FeO and chromium(III)_oxide (Cr2O3) additions may be used for the
production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is
used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish
to almost black.[64] A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a
reducing combustion atmosphere.[65] Manganese_dioxide can be added in small
amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. Art_glass and studio
glass pieces are colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific
combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and "cook" times. Most
colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who
serve this market, although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make
their own color from raw materials.

glass

Wine goblet, mid-19th century. Qajar dynasty. Brooklyn_Museum.
Roman cage_cup from the 4th century CE
Studio_glass. Multiple colors within a single object increase the difficulty of
production, as glasses of different colors have different chemical and physical
properties when molten.
Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic_glass obsidian, was used by
many Stone_Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting
tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded.
Archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal
north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient_Egypt.[66] The earliest known glass
objects, of the mid third millennium BCE, were beads, perhaps initially created
as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of
faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing.
[67]
Glass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze
Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt. Indigenous
development of glass technology in South_Asia may have begun in 1730 BCE.[68]
In ancient China, though, glassmaking seems to have a late start, compared to
ceramics and metal work. The term glass developed in the late Roman_Empire. It
was in the Roman_glassmaking center at Trier, now in modern Germany, that the
late-Latin term glesum originated, probably from a Germanic word for a
transparent, lustrous substance.[69] Glass objects have been recovered across
the Roman Empire[70] in domestic, funerary,[71] and industrial contexts.[72]
Examples of Roman_glass have been found outside of the former Roman Empire in
China,[73] the Baltics, the Middle_East and India.[74]
Glass was used extensively during the Middle_Ages. Anglo-Saxon glass has been
found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and
cemetery sites.[75] Glass in the Anglo-Saxon_period was used in the manufacture
of a range of objects including vessels, windows,[76] beads,[77] and was also
used in jewelry.[78] From the 10th-century onwards, glass was employed in
stained_glass windows of churches and cathedrals, with famous examples at
Chartres_Cathedral and the Basilica_of_Saint_Denis. By the 14th-century,
architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-
Chapelle, Paris, (1203â1248)[79] and the East end of Gloucester_Cathedral.
[80] Stained glass had a major revival with Gothic_Revival_architecture in the
19th century.[81] With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style,
the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent.[82] The use of
domestic stained glass increased[83] until most substantial houses had glass
windows. These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes
in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly
larger sheets. This led to larger window panes, and, in the 20th-century, to
much larger windows in ordinary domestic and commercial buildings.
In the 20th century, new types of glass such as laminated_glass, reinforced
glass and glass_bricks[84] increased the use of glass as a building material
and resulted in new applications of glass.[85] Multi-story buildings are
frequently constructed with curtain_walls made almost entirely of glass.[86]
Similarly, laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens.
[87] Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages.[88] The
production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers[89]
as well as having other application in medicine and science.[90] Glass is also
employed as the aperture cover in many solar_energy collectors.[91]
From the 19th century, there was a revival in many ancient glass-making
techniques including cameo_glass, achieved for the first time since the Roman
Empire and initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style.[92] The
Art_Nouveau movement made great use of glass,[93] with RenÃ©_Lalique, Ãmile
GallÃ©, and Daum_of_Nancy producing colored vases and similar pieces, often in
cameo glass, and also using luster techniques. Louis_Comfort_Tiffany in America
specialized in stained glass, both secular and religious, and his famous lamps.
The early 20th-century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by
firms such as Waterford and Lalique. From about 1960 onwards, there have been
an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks, and glass
artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass, and
their works as part fine_arts.
In the 21st century, scientists observe the properties of ancient stained glass
windows, in which suspended nanoparticles prevent UV light from causing
chemical reactions that change image colors, are developing photographic
techniques that use similar stained glass to capture true color images of Mars
for the 2019 ESA Mars Rover mission.[94]

***** Other types[edit] *****
New chemical glass compositions or new treatment techniques can be initially
investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The raw materials for
laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass
production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly
pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not
reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or
alkaline_earth_metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron_oxide), or that the
impurities are quantified (loss on ignition).[105] Evaporation losses during
glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials,
e.g., sodium_selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more
readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones,
such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum
crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity
is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass_batch), by
stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained
glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.[105][106]
To make glass from materials with poor glass forming tendencies, novel
techniques are used to increase cooling rate, or reduce crystal nucleation
triggers. Examples of these techniques include aerodynamic_levitation (cooling
the melt whilst it floats on a gas stream), splat_quenching (pressing the melt
between two metal anvils) and roller quenching (pouring the melt through
rollers).
Some glass_fibers
**** Fiberglass[edit] ****
Main article: Fiberglass
See also: Glass_wool and Fiber-reinforced_plastic
Fiberglass (also called glass-reinforced-plastic[107][108]) is a composite
material made up of glass_fibers (also called fiberglass[109] or glass friller
[110]) embedded in a plastic resin.[111][112] It is made by melting glass and
stretching the glass into fibers. These fibers are woven together into a cloth
and left to set in a plastic resin.[113]
Fiberglass filaments are made through a pultrusion process in which the raw
materials (sand, limestone, kaolin_clay, fluorspar, colemanite, dolomite and
other minerals) are melted in a large furnace into a liquid which is extruded
through very small orifices (5â25 micrometres in diameter if the glass is E-
glass and 9 micrometers if the glass is S-glass).[114]
Fiberglass has the properties of being lightweight and corrosion resistant.
[115][116] Fiberglass is also a good insulator,[117] allowing it to be used to
insulate buildings.[118] Most fiberglasses are not alkali resistant.[119]
Fiberglass also has the property of becoming stronger as the glass ages.[120]
**** Network glasses[edit] ****
A CD-RW (CD). Chalcogenide_glass form the basis of rewritable CD and DVD solid-
state memory technology.[121]
Some types of glass that do not include silica as a major constituent may have
physico-chemical properties useful for their application in fiber_optics and
other specialized technical applications.[122] These include fluoride_glass,
aluminate and aluminosilicate glass, phosphate_glass, borate_glass, and
chalcogenide_glass.
There are three classes of components for oxide glass: network formers,
intermediates, and modifiers.[123] The network formers (silicon, boron,
germanium) form a highly cross-linked network of chemical bonds. The
intermediates (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) can
act as both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition.
[124] The modifiers (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the
network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-
bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and
holding one negative charge to compensate for the positive ion nearby.[125]
Some elements can play multiple roles; e.g. lead can act both as a network
former (Pb4+ replacing Si4+), or as a modifier.[126]
The presence of non-bridging oxygens lowers the relative number of strong bonds
in the material and disrupts the network, decreasing the viscosity of the melt
and lowering the melting temperature.[124]
The alkali metal ions are small and mobile; their presence in glass allows a
degree of electrical_conductivity, especially in molten state or at high
temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass,
allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions,
with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen
ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also
hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common
commercial glass types contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually
sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance.
[127] Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal
of the alkali ions from the glass surface[128] by reaction with sulfur or
fluorine compounds.[129] Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental
effect to the loss_tangent of the glass,[130] and to its electrical_resistance;
glass manufactured for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps ...) have to
take this in account.
Addition of lead(II)_oxide lowers melting point, lowers viscosity of the melt,
and increases refractive_index. Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other
metal oxides and is used in colored glass. The viscosity decrease of lead glass
melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glass);
this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence
its frequent use as an additive in vitreous_enamels and glass_solders. The high
ionic_radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and
hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical
resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (108.5 vs
106.5 Î©âcm, DC at 250 Â°C). For more details, see lead_glass.[131]
Addition of fluorine lowers the dielectric_constant of glass. Fluorine is
highly electronegative and attracts the electrons in the lattice, lowering the
polarizability of the material. Such silicon dioxide-fluoride is used in
manufacture of integrated_circuits as an insulator. High levels of fluorine
doping lead to formation of volatile SiF2O and such glass is then thermally
unstable. Stable layers were achieved with dielectric constant down to about
3.5â3.7.[132]
**** Amorphous metals[edit] ****
Main article: Amorphous_metal
Samples of amorphous metal, with millimeter scale
In the past, small batches of amorphous_metals with high surface area
configurations (ribbons, wires, films, etc.) have been produced through the
implementation of extremely rapid rates of cooling. This was initially termed
"splat cooling" by doctoral student W. Klement at Caltech, who showed that
cooling rates on the order of millions of degrees per second is sufficient to
impede the formation of crystals, and the metallic atoms become "locked into" a
glassy state. Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten
metal onto a spinning metal disk. More recently a number of alloys have been
produced in layers with thickness exceeding 1 millimeter. These are known as
bulk metallic glasses (BMG). Liquidmetal_Technologies sell a number of
zirconium-based BMGs. Batches of amorphous steel have also been produced that
demonstrate mechanical properties far exceeding those found in conventional
steel alloys.[133][134][135]
In 2004, NIST researchers presented evidence that an isotropic non-crystalline
metallic phase (dubbed "q-glass") could be grown from the melt. This phase is
the first phase, or "primary phase", to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during
rapid cooling. Experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a
first-order transition. Transmission_electron_microscopy (TEM) images show that
the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow
spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The diffraction
pattern shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase. Yet there is a nucleation
barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface)
between the glass and the melt.[136][137]
**** Electrolytes[edit] ****
Electrolytes or molten salts are mixtures of different ions. In a mixture of
three or more ionic species of dissimilar size and shape, crystallization can
be so difficult that the liquid can easily be supercooled into a glass. The
best-studied example is Ca0.4K0.6(NO3)1.4. Glass electrolytes in the form of
Ba-doped Li-glass and Ba-doped Na-glass have been proposed as solutions to
problems identified with organic liquid electrolytes used in modern lithium-ion
battery cells.[138]
**** Aqueous solutions[edit] ****
Some aqueous_solutions can be supercooled into a glassy state,[139][140] for
instance LiCl:RH2O (a solution of lithium_chloride salt and water molecules) in
the composition range 4<R<8.[141] An aqueous solution containing sugar has a
glassy state and can be used as a surfactant.[142]
**** Molecular liquids[edit] ****
A molecular liquid is composed of molecules that do not form a covalent network
but interact only through weak van_der_Waals_forces or through transient
hydrogen_bonds. Many molecular liquids can be supercooled into a glass; some
are excellent glass formers that normally do not crystallize.
An example of this is sugar_glass.[143]
Under extremes of pressure and temperature solids may exhibit large structural
and physical changes that can lead to polyamorphic phase transitions.[144] In
2006 Italian scientists created an amorphous phase of carbon_dioxide using
extreme pressure. The substance was named amorphous_carbonia(a-CO2) and
exhibits an atomic structure resembling that of silica.[145]
**** Polymers[edit] ****
Important polymer glasses include amorphous and glassy pharmaceutical
compounds. These are useful because the solubility of the compound is greatly
increased when it is amorphous compared to the same crystalline composition.
Many emerging pharmaceuticals are practically insoluble in their crystalline
forms.[146]
**** Colloidal glasses[edit] ****
Concentrated colloidal suspensions may exhibit a distinct glass transition as
function of particle concentration or density.[147][148][149]
In cell_biology, there is recent evidence suggesting that the cytoplasm behaves
like a colloidal glass approaching the liquid-glass transition.[150][151]
During periods of low metabolic activity, as in dormancy, the cytoplasm
vitrifies and prohibits the movement to larger cytoplasmic particles while
allowing the diffusion of smaller ones throughout the cell.[150]
**** Glass-ceramics[edit] ****
A high-strength glass-ceramic cooktop with negligible thermal_expansion.
Glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both non-crystalline glass
and crystalline ceramics. They are formed as a glass, and then partially
crystallized by heat treatment. For example, the microstructure of whiteware
ceramics frequently contains both amorphous and crystalline phases. Crystalline
grains are often embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase of grain
boundaries. When applied to whiteware ceramics, vitreous means the material has
an extremely low permeability to liquids, often but not always water, when
determined by a specified test regime.[152][153]
The term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates that yields an
array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties. The most
commercially important of these have the distinction of being impervious to
thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop
cooking. The negative thermal_expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline
ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a
certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero.
This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can
sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 Â°C.[152][153]
***** Structure[edit] *****
Main article: Structure_of_liquids_and_glasses
As in other amorphous_solids, the atomic structure of a glass lacks the long-
range periodicity observed in crystalline_solids. Due to chemical_bonding
characteristics, glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with
respect to local atomic polyhedra.[154]
The amorphous structure of glassy silica (SiO2) in two dimensions. No long-
range order is present, although there is local ordering with respect to the
tetrahedral arrangement of oxygen (O) atoms around the silicon (Si) atoms.
**** Formation from a supercooled liquid[edit] ****
Main article: Glass_transition
In physics, the standard definition of a glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid
formed by rapid melt quenching,[155][156][157][158][159] although the term
glass is often used to describe any amorphous_solid that exhibits a glass
transition temperature Tg. For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently
rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then
crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered atomic configuration of
the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a
material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This
ability can be predicted by the rigidity_theory.[160] Generally, a glass exists
in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form,
although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no
crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.[161]
Glass is sometimes considered to be a liquid due to its lack of a first-order
phase_transition[162][163] where certain thermodynamic variables such as
volume, entropy and enthalpy are discontinuous through the glass transition
range. The glass_transition may be described as analogous to a second-order
phase transition where the intensive thermodynamic variables such as the
thermal_expansivity and heat_capacity are discontinuous.[156] Nonetheless, the
equilibrium theory of phase transformations does not entirely hold for glass,
and hence the glass transition cannot be classed as one of the classical
equilibrium phase transformations in solids.[158][159]
Glass is an amorphous solid. It exhibits an atomic structure close to that
observed in the supercooled liquid phase but displays all the mechanical
properties of a solid.[162][164] The notion that glass flows to an appreciable
extent over extended periods of time is not supported by empirical research or
theoretical analysis (see viscosity_of_amorphous_materials). Laboratory
measurements of room temperature glass flow do show a motion consistent with a
material viscosity on the order of 1017â1018 Pa s.[165]
Although the atomic structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure
in a supercooled_liquid, glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass
transition temperature.[166] A supercooled liquid behaves as a liquid, but it
is below the freezing_point of the material, and in some cases will crystallize
almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity
at a glass transition and a melting_transition of comparable materials are
typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active
degrees_of_freedom is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it
is mostly only the vibrational degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas
rotational and translational motion is arrested. This helps to explain why both
crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental
time scales.

**** Behavior of antique glass[edit] ****
The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the
bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view
that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the
glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another.
[168] This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing.
The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were
commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so
as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown_glass process,
described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not
absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the
glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with
the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water
accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window.[169] Occasionally,
such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or
right.[170]
Mass production of glass window panes in the early twentieth century caused a
similar effect. In glass factories, molten glass was poured onto a large
cooling table and allowed to spread. The resulting glass is thicker at the
location of the pour, located at the center of the large sheet. These sheets
were cut into smaller window panes with nonuniform thickness, typically with
the location of the pour centered in one of the panes (known as "bull's-eyes")
for decorative effect. Modern glass intended for windows is produced as float
glass and is very uniform in thickness.
Several other points can be considered that contradict the "cathedral glass
flow" theory:
    * Writing in the American_Journal_of_Physics, the materials engineer Edgar
      D._Zanotto states "... the predicted relaxation_time for GeO2 at room
      temperature is 1032_years. Hence, the relaxation period (characteristic
      flow time) of cathedral glasses would be even longer."[171] (1032 years
      is many times longer than the estimated age_of_the_universe.)
    * If medieval glass has flowed perceptibly, then ancient Roman and Egyptian
      objects should have flowed proportionately moreâbut this is not
      observed. Similarly, prehistoric obsidian blades should have lost their
      edge; this is not observed either (although obsidian may have a different
      viscosity from window glass).[162]
    * If glass flows at a rate that allows changes to be seen with the naked
      eye after centuries, then the effect should be noticeable in antique
      telescopes. Any slight deformation in the antique telescopic lenses would
      lead to a dramatic decrease in optical performance, a phenomenon that is
      not observed. However, the glass used in telescopic lenses is generally
      different from what is used in windowpanes.[162]
