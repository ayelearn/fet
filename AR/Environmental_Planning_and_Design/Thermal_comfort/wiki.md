This article is about comfort zones in building construction. For other uses,
see Comfort_zone_(disambiguation).
Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the
thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation (ANSI/ASHRAE
Standard_55).[1] The human body can be viewed as a heat engine where food is
the input energy. The human body will generate excess heat into the
environment, so the body can continue to operate. The heat transfer is
proportional to temperature difference. In cold environments, the body loses
more heat to the environment and in hot environments the body does not exert
enough heat. Both the hot and cold scenarios lead to discomfort.[2] Maintaining
this standard of thermal comfort for occupants of buildings or other enclosures
is one of the important goals of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning) design engineers. Most people will feel comfortable at room
temperature, colloquially a range of temperatures around 20 to 22 Â°C (68 to
72 Â°F),[3] but this may vary greatly between individuals and depending on
factors such as activity level, clothing, and humidity.
Thermal neutrality is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is
allowed to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the
surroundings. The main factors that influence thermal comfort are those that
determine heat gain and loss, namely metabolic_rate, clothing_insulation, air
temperature, mean_radiant_temperature, air speed and relative_humidity.
Psychological parameters, such as individual expectations, also affect thermal
comfort.[4]
The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model stands among the most recognized thermal
comfort models. It was developed using principles of heat balance and
experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady_state
conditions.[5] The adaptive model, on the other hand, was developed based on
hundreds of field studies with the idea that occupants dynamically interact
with their environment. Occupants control their thermal environment by means of
clothing, operable windows, fans, personal heaters, and sun shades.[4][6]
The PMV model can be applied to air-conditioned buildings, while the adaptive
model can be generally applied only to buildings where no mechanical systems
have been installed.[1] There is no consensus about which comfort model should
be applied for buildings that are partially air-conditioned spatially or
temporally.
Thermal comfort calculations according to ANSI/ASHRAE_Standard_55[1] can be
freely performed with the CBE Thermal_Comfort_Tool_for_ASHRAE_55.
Similar to ASHRAE Standard 55 there are other comfort standards like EN 15251
[7] and the ISO 7730 standard.[8][9]

***** Significance[edit] *****
Satisfaction with the thermal environment is important because thermal
conditions are potentially life-threatening for humans if the core_body
temperature reaches conditions of hyperthermia, above 37.5â38.3 Â°C
(99.5â100.9 Â°F),[10][11] or hypothermia below 35.0 Â°C (95.0 Â°F).[12]
Buildings modify the conditions of the external environment and reduce the
effort that our body needs to do in order to stay stable at a normal human_body
temperature, important for the correct functioning of our physiological
processes.
The roman writer Vitruvius actually linked this purpose to the birth of
Architecture.[13] David_Linden also suggests that the reason why we associate
tropical beaches with paradise is because in those environments is where our
bodies need to do less metabolic_effort to maintain our core temperature.[14]
Temperature not only supports human life; coolness and warmth have also become
in different cultures a symbol of protection, community and even the sacred.
[15]
In building_science studies, thermal comfort has been related to productivity
and health. Office workers who are satisfied with their thermal environment are
more productive.[16][17] The combination of high temperature and high relative
humidity reduces thermal comfort and indoor_air_quality.[18]
Although a single static temperature can be comfortable, people are attracted
by thermal changes, such as campfires and cool pools. Thermal pleasure is
caused by varying thermal sensations from a state of unpleasantness to a state
of pleasantness, and the scientific term for it is positive thermal
alliesthesia.[19] From a state of thermal neutrality or comfort any change will
be perceived as unpleasant.[20] This challenges the assumption that
mechanically_controlled_buildings should deliver uniform temperatures and
comfort, if it is at the cost of excluding thermal pleasure.[21]
***** Influencing factors[edit] *****
Since there are large variations from person to person in terms of
physiological and psychological satisfaction, it is hard to find an optimal
temperature for everyone in a given space. Laboratory and field data have been
collected to define conditions that will be found comfortable for a specified
percentage of occupants.[1]
There are six primary factors that directly affect thermal comfort that can be
grouped in two categories: personal factors - because they are characteristics
of the occupants - and environmental factors - which are conditions of the
thermal environment. The former are metabolic rate and clothing level, the
latter are air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air speed and humidity.
Even if all these factors may vary with time, standards usually refer to a
steady state to study thermal comfort, just allowing limited temperature
variations.
**** Metabolic rate[edit] ****
People have different metabolic rates that can fluctuate due to activity level
and environmental conditions.[22][23][24] The ASHRAE 55-2010 Standard defines
metabolic rate as the level of transformation of chemical energy into heat and
mechanical work by metabolic activities within an organism, usually expressed
in terms of unit area of the total body surface. Metabolic rate is expressed in
met units, which are defined as follows:
1 met = 58.2 W/mÂ² (18.4 Btu/hÂ·ftÂ²), which is equal to the energy produced
per unit surface area of an average person seated at rest. The surface area of
an average person is 1.8 mÂ² (19 ftÂ²).[1]
ASHRAE Standard 55 provides a table of met rates for a variety of activities.
Some common values are 0.7 met for sleeping, 1.0 met for a seated and quiet
position, 1.2-1.4 met for light activities standing, 2.0 met or more for
activities that involve movement, walking, lifting heavy loads or operating
machinery. For intermittent activity, the Standard states that is permissible
to use a time-weighted average metabolic rate if individuals are performing
activities that vary over a period of one hour or less. For longer periods,
different metabolic rates must be considered.[1]
According to ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, estimating metabolic rates is
complex, and for levels above 2 or 3 met â especially if there are various
ways of performing such activities â the accuracy is low. Therefore, the
Standard is not applicable for activities with an average level higher than 2
met. Met values can also be determined more accurately than the tabulated ones,
using an empirical equation that takes into account the rate of respiratory
oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Another physiological yet
less accurate method is related to the heart rate, since there is a
relationship between the latter and oxygen production.[25]
The Compendium of Physical Activities is used by physicians to record physical
activities. It has a different definition of met that is the ratio of the
metabolic rate of the activity in question to a resting metabolic rate.[26] As
the formulation of the concept is different from the one that ASHRAE uses,
these met values cannot be used directly in PMV calculations, but it opens up a
new way of quantifying physical activities.
Food and drink habits may have an influence on metabolic rates, which
indirectly influences thermal preferences. These effects may change depending
on food and drink intake.[27] Body shape is another factor that affects thermal
comfort. Heat dissipation depends on body surface area. A tall and skinny
person has a larger surface-to-volume ratio, can dissipate heat more easily,
and can tolerate higher temperatures more than a person with a rounded body
shape.[27]
**** Clothing insulation[edit] ****
Main article: Clothing_insulation
The amount of thermal insulation worn by a person has a substantial impact on
thermal comfort, because it influences the heat loss and consequently the
thermal balance. Layers of insulating clothing prevent heat loss and can either
help keep a person warm or lead to overheating. Generally, the thicker the
garment is, the greater insulating ability it has. Depending on the type of
material the clothing is made out of, air movement and relative humidity can
decrease the insulating ability of the material.[28][29]
1 clo is equal to 0.155 mÂ²Â·K/W (0.88 Â°FÂ·ftÂ²Â·h/Btu). This corresponds to
trousers, a long sleeved shirt, and a jacket. Clothing insulation values for
other common ensembles or single garments can be found in ASHRAE 55.[1]
**** Air temperature[edit] ****
Main article: Dry-bulb_temperature
The air temperature is the average temperature of the air surrounding the
occupant, with respect to location and time. According to ASHRAE 55 standard,
the spatial average takes into account the ankle, waist and head levels, which
vary for seated or standing occupants. The temporal average is based on three-
minutes intervals with at least 18 equally spaced points in time. Air
temperature is measured with a dry-bulb thermometer and for this reason it is
also known as dry-bulb_temperature.
**** Mean radiant temperature[edit] ****
Main article: Mean_radiant_temperature
The radiant temperature is related to the amount of radiant heat transferred
from a surface, and it depends on the material's ability to absorb or emit
heat, or its emissivity. The mean_radiant_temperature depends on the
temperatures and emissivities of the surrounding surfaces as well as the view
factor, or the amount of the surface that is âseenâ by the object. So the
mean radiant temperature experienced by a person in a room with the sunlight
streaming in varies based on how much of his/her body is in the sun.
**** Air speed[edit] ****
In HVAC, air speed is defined as the rate of air movement at a point, without
regard to direction. According to ANSI/ASHRAE_Standard_55, it is the average
speed of the air to which the body is exposed, with respect to location and
time. The temporal average is the same as the air temperature, while the
spatial average is based on the assumption that the body is exposed to a
uniform air speed, according to the SET thermo-physiological model. However,
some spaces might provide strongly nonuniform air velocity fields and
consequent skin heat losses that cannot be considered uniform. Therefore, the
designer shall decide the proper averaging, especially including air speeds
incident on unclothed body parts, that have greater cooling effect and
potential for local discomfort.[1]
**** Relative humidity[edit] ****
Main article: Relative_humidity
Relative_humidity (RH) is the ratio of the amount of water vapor in the air to
the amount of water vapor that the air could hold at the specific temperature
and pressure. While the human body has sensors within the skin that are fairly
efficient at feeling heat and cold, relative humidity is detected indirectly.
Sweating is an effective heat loss mechanism that relies on evaporation from
the skin. However at high RH, the air has close to the maximum water vapor that
it can hold, so evaporation, and therefore heat loss, is decreased. On the
other hand, very dry environments (RH < 20-30%) are also uncomfortable because
of their effect on the mucous membranes. The recommended level of indoor
humidity is in the range of 30-60% in air conditioned buildings,[30][31] but
new standards such as the adaptive model allow lower and higher humidities,
depending on the other factors involved in thermal comfort.
Recently, the effects of low relative humidity and high air velocity were
tested on humans after bathing. Researchers found that low relative humidity
engendered thermal discomfort as well as the sensation of dryness and itching.
It is recommended to keep relative humidity levels higher in a bathroom than
other rooms in the house for optimal conditions.[32]
*** Skin wettedness[edit] ***
Skin wettedness is defined as "the proportion of the total skin surface area of
the body covered with sweat."[33] The wetness of skin in different areas also
affects perceived thermal comfort. Humidity can increase wetness on different
areas of the body, leading to a perception of discomfort. This is usually
localized in different parts of the body, and local thermal comfort limits for
skin wettedness differ by locations of the body.[34] The extremities are much
more sensitive to thermal discomfort from wetness than the trunk of the body.
Although local thermal discomfort can be caused from wetness, the thermal
comfort of the whole body will not be affected by the wetness of certain parts.
*** Interplay of temperature and humidity[edit] ***
Various types of apparent_temperature have been developed to combine air
temperature and air humidity. For higher temperatures, there are quantitative
scales, such as the heat_index. For lower temperatures, a related interplay was
identified only qualitatively:
     High humidity and low temperatures cause the air to feel chilly.[35]
     Cold air with high relative humidity "feels" colder than dry air of
     the same temperature because high humidity in cold weather increases
     the conduction of heat from the body.[36]
     There has been controversy over why damp cold air feels colder than
     dry cold air. Some believe it is because when the humidity is high,
     our skin and clothing become moist and are better conductors of heat,
     so there is more cooling by conduction.[37]
**** Natural ventilation[edit] ****
Main article: Natural_ventilation
Many buildings use an HVAC_unit to control their thermal environment. Other
buildings are naturally_ventilated and do not rely on mechanical systems to
provide thermal comfort. Depending on the climate, this can drastically reduce
energy consumption. It is sometimes seen as a risk, though, since indoor
temperatures can be too extreme if the building is poorly designed. Properly
designed, naturally ventilated buildings keep indoor conditions within the
range where opening windows and using fans in the summer, and wearing extra
clothing in the winter, can keep people thermally comfortable[citation_needed].
Deciding between natural ventilation and mechanical ventilation depends on how
the space will be used and how air flows in the room or building due to
phenomena such as stack effect[38]. Both options have advantages and shortfalls
for HVAC engineers to assess.
***** Models[edit] *****
When discussing thermal comfort, there are two main different models that can
be used: the static model (PMV/PPD) and the adaptive model.
**** PMV/PPD method[edit] ****
Psychrometric Chart
Temperature-relative humidity chart
Two alternative representations of thermal comfort for the PMV/PPD method
The PMV/PPD model was developed by P.O._Fanger using heat-balance equations and
empirical studies about skin_temperature to define comfort. Standard thermal
comfort surveys ask subjects about their thermal sensation on a seven-point
scale from cold (-3) to hot (+3). Fanger's equations are used to calculate the
Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) of a group of subjects for a particular combination
of air_temperature, mean_radiant_temperature, relative_humidity, air speed,
metabolic rate, and clothing_insulation.[5] PMV equal to zero is representing
thermal neutrality, and the comfort zone is defined by the combinations of the
six parameters for which the PMV is within the recommended limits (-
0.5<PMV<+0.5).[1] Although predicting the thermal sensation of a population is
an important step in determining what conditions are comfortable, it is more
useful to consider whether or not people will be satisfied. Fanger developed
another equation to relate the PMV to the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied
(PPD). This relation was based on studies that surveyed subjects in a chamber
where the indoor conditions could be precisely controlled.[5]
The PMV/PPD model is applied globally but does not directly take into account
the adaptation mechanisms and outdoor thermal conditions.[39][40][41]
ASHRAE Standard 55-2017 uses the PMV model to set the requirements for indoor
thermal conditions. It requires that at least 80% of the occupants be
satisfied.[1]
The CBE Thermal_Comfort_Tool_for_ASHRAE_55 allows users to input the six
comfort parameters to determine whether a certain combination complies with
ASHRAE 55. The results are displayed on a psychrometric or a temperature-
relative humidity chart and indicate the ranges of temperature and relative
humidity that will be comfortable with the given the values input for the
remaining four parameters.[42]
The PMV/PPD model has a low prediction accuracy.[43] Using the world largest
thermal comfort field survey database,[44] the accuracy of PMV in predicting
occupant's thermal sensation was only 34%, meaning that the thermal sensation
is correctly predicted one out of three times. The PPD was overestimating
subject's thermal unacceptability outside the thermal neutrality ranges (-
1â¤PMVâ¤1). The PMV/PPD accuracy varies strongly between ventilation
strategies, building types and climates.[43]
*** Elevated air speed method[edit] ***
ASHRAE 55 2013 accounts for air speeds above 0.2 metres per second (0.66 ft/s)
separately than the baseline model. Because air movement can provide direct
cooling to people, particularly if they are not wearing much clothing, higher
temperatures can be more comfortable than the PMV model predicts. Air speeds up
to 0.8 m/s (2.6 ft/s) are allowed without local control, and 1.2 m/s is
possible with local control. This elevated air movement increases the maximum
temperature for an office space in the summer to 30 Â°C from 27.5 Â°C
(86.0â81.5 Â°F).[1]
*** Virtual Energy for Thermal Comfort[edit] ***
"Virtual Energy for Thermal Comfort" is the amount of energy that will be
required to make a non-air-conditioned building relatively as comfortable as
one with air-conditioning. This is based on the assumption that the home will
eventually install air-conditioning or heating.[45] Passive design improves
thermal comfort in a building, thus reducing demand for heating or cooling. In
many developing_countries, however, most occupants do not currently heat or
cool, due to economic constraints, as well as climate conditions which border
lines comfort conditions such as cold winter nights in Johannesburg (South
Africa) or warm summer days in San Jose, Costa Rica. At the same time, as
incomes rise, there is a strong tendency to introduce cooling and heating
systems. If we recognize and reward passive design features that improve
thermal comfort today, we diminish the risk of having to install HVAC systems
in the future, or we at least ensure that such systems will be smaller and less
frequently used. Or in case the heating or cooling system is not installed due
to high cost, at least people should not suffer from discomfort indoors. To
provide an example, in San Jose, Costa Rica, if a house were being designed
with high level of glazing and small opening sizes, the internal temperature
would easily rise above 30 Â°C (86 Â°F) and natural ventilation would not be
enough to remove the internal heat gains and solar gains. This is why Virtual
Energy for Comfort is important.
World_Bank's assessment tool the EDGE_software (Excellence_in_Design_for
Greater_Efficiencies) illustrates the potential issues with discomfort in
buildings and has created the concept of Virtual Energy for Comfort which
provides for a way to present potential thermal discomfort. This approach is
used to award for design solutions which improves thermal comfort even in a
fully free running building. Despite the inclusion of requirements for
overheating in CIBSE, overcooling has not been assessed. However, overcooling
can be an issue, mainly in the developing world, for example in cities such as
Lima (Peru), Bogota, and Delhi, where cooler indoor temperatures can occur
frequently. This may be a new area for research and design guidance for
reduction of discomfort.
*** Standard effective temperature[edit] ***
Standard effective temperature (SET*) is a model of human response to the
thermal environment. Developed by A.P. Gagge and accepted by ASHRAE in 1986,
[46] it is also referred to as the Pierce Two-Node model.[47] Its calculation
is similar to PMV because it is a comprehensive comfort index based on heat-
balance equations that incorporates the personal factors of clothing and
metabolic rate. Its fundamental difference is it takes a two-node method to
represent human physiology in measuring skin temperature and skin wettedness.
[46]
ASHRAE_55-2010 defines SET as "the temperature of an imaginary environment at
50% relative_humidity, <0.1 m/s [0.33 ft/s] average air speed, and mean radiant
temperature equal to average air temperature, in which total heat loss from the
skin of an imaginary occupant with an activity level of 1.0 met and a clothing
level of 0.6 clo is the same as that from a person in the actual environment,
with actual clothing and activity level."[1]
Research has tested the model against experimental data and found it tends to
overestimate skin temperature and underestimate skin wettedness.[47][48]
Fountain and Huizenga (1997) developed a thermal sensation prediction tool that
computes SET.[49]
*** Local thermal discomfort[edit] ***
Although thermal comfort is usually discussed for the body as a whole, thermal
dissatisfaction may also occur just for a particular part of the body, due to
local sources of unwanted heating, cooling or air movement.[50] According to
the ASHRAE 55-2010 standard,[1] there are four main causes of thermal
discomfort to be considered. A section of the standard specifies the
requirements for these factors, that apply to a lightly clothed person engaged
in near sedentary physical activity. This is because people with higher
metabolic rates and/or more clothing insulation are less thermally sensitive,
and consequently have less risk of thermal discomfort.
** Radiant temperature asymmetry[edit] **
Large differences in the thermal radiation of the surfaces surrounding a person
may cause local discomfort or reduce acceptance of the thermal conditions.
ASHRAE Standard 55 sets limits on the allowable temperature differences between
various surfaces. Because people are more sensitive to some asymmetries than
others, for example that of a warm ceiling versus that of hot and cold vertical
surfaces, the limits depend on which surfaces are involved. The ceiling is not
allowed to be more than +5 Â°C (9.0 Â°F) warmer, whereas a wall may be up to
+23 Â°C (41 Â°F) warmer than the other surfaces.[1]
** Draft[edit] **
While air movement can be pleasant and provide comfort in some circumstances,
it is sometimes unwanted and causes discomfort. This unwanted air movement is
called "draft" and is most prevalent when the thermal sensation of the whole
body is cool. People are most likely to feel a draft on uncovered body parts
such as their head, neck, shoulders, ankles, feet, and legs, but the sensation
also depends on the air speed, air temperature, activity, and clothing.[1]
** Vertical air temperature difference[edit] **
Thermal stratification that results in the air temperature at the head level
being higher than at the ankle level may cause thermal discomfort. ASHRAE
Standard 55 recommends that the difference not be greater than 3 Â°C (5.4 Â°F)
for seated occupants or for standing occupants 4 Â°C (7.2 Â°F).[1]
** Floor surface temperature[edit] **
Floors that are too warm or too cool may cause discomfort, depending on
footwear. ASHRAE 55 recommends that floor temperatures stay in the range of
19â29 Â°C (66â84 Â°F) in spaces where occupants will be wearing lightweight
shoes.[1]
**** Adaptive comfort model[edit] ****
Adaptive chart according to ASHRAE Standard 55-2010
The adaptive model is based on the idea that outdoor climate influences indoor
comfort because humans can adapt to different temperatures during different
times of the year. The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors,
such as having access to environmental controls, and past thermal history can
influence building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences.[4] Numerous
researchers have conducted field studies worldwide in which they survey
building occupants about their thermal comfort while taking simultaneous
environmental measurements. Analyzing a database of results from 160 of these
buildings revealed that occupants of naturally ventilated buildings accept and
even prefer a wider range of temperatures than their counterparts in sealed,
air-conditioned buildings because their preferred temperature depends on
outdoor conditions.[4] These results were incorporated in the ASHRAE 55-2004
standard as the adaptive comfort model. The adaptive chart relates indoor
comfort temperature to prevailing outdoor temperature and defines zones of 80%
and 90% satisfaction.[1]
The ASHRAE-55 2010 Standard introduced the prevailing mean outdoor temperature
as the input variable for the adaptive model. It is based on the arithmetic
average of the mean daily outdoor temperatures over no fewer than 7 and no more
than 30 sequential days prior to the day in question.[1] It can also be
calculated by weighting the temperatures with different coefficients, assigning
increasing importance to the most recent temperatures. In case this weighting
is used, there is no need to respect the upper limit for the subsequent days.
In order to apply the adaptive model, there should be no mechanical cooling
system for the space, occupants should be engaged in sedentary activities with
metabolic rates of 1-1.3 met, and a prevailing mean temperature greater than
10 Â°C (50.0 Â°F) and less than 33.5 Â°C (92.3 Â°F).[1]
This model applies especially to occupant-controlled, natural-conditioned
spaces, where the outdoor climate can actually affect the indoor conditions and
so the comfort zone. In fact, studies by de Dear and Brager showed that
occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a wider range of
temperatures.[4] This is due to both behavioral and physiological adjustments,
since there are different types of adaptive processes.[51] ASHRAE Standard 55-
2010 states that differences in recent thermal experiences, changes in
clothing, availability of control options, and shifts in occupant expectations
can change people's thermal responses.[1]
Adaptive models of thermal comfort are implemented in other standards, such as
European EN 15251 and ISO 7730 standard. While the exact derivation methods and
results are slightly different from the ASHRAE 55 adaptive standard, they are
substantially the same. A larger difference is in applicability. The ASHRAE
adaptive standard only applies to buildings without mechanical cooling
installed, while EN15251 can be applied to mixed-mode buildings, provided the
system is not running.[7]
There are basically three categories of thermal adaptation, namely: behavioral,
physiological, and psychological.
*** Psychological Adaptation[edit] ***
An individual's comfort level in a given environment may change and adapt over
time due to psychological factors. Subjective perception of thermal comfort may
be influenced by the memory of previous experiences. Habituation takes place
when repeated exposure moderates future expectations, and responses to sensory
input. This is an important factor in explaining the difference between field
observations and PMV predictions (based on the static model) in naturally
ventilated buildings. In these buildings, the relationship with the outdoor
temperatures has been twice as strong as predicted.[4]
Psychological adaptation is subtly different in the static and adaptive models.
Laboratory tests of the static model can identify and quantify non-heat
transfer (psychological) factors that affect reported comfort. The adaptive
model is limited to reporting differences (called psychological) between
modeled and reported comfort.[citation_needed]
Thermal comfort as a "condition of mind" is defined in psychological terms.
Among the factors that affect the condition of mind (in the laboratory) are a
sense of control over the temperature, knowledge of the temperature and the
appearance of the (test) environment. A thermal test chamber that appeared
residential "felt" warmer than one which looked like the inside of a
refrigerator.[52]
*** Physiological Adaptation[edit] ***
Further information: Thermoregulation
The body has several thermal adjustment mechanisms to survive in drastic
temperature environments. In a cold environment the body utilizes
vasoconstriction; which reduces blood flow to the skin, skin temperature and
heat dissipation. In a warm environment, vasodilation will increase blood flow
to the skin, heat transport, and skin temperature and heat dissipation.[53] If
there is an imbalance despite the vasomotor adjustments listed above, in a warm
environment sweat production will start and provide evaporative cooling. If
this is insufficient, hyperthermia will set in, body temperature may reach
40 Â°C (104 Â°F), and heat_stroke may occur. In a cold environment, shivering
will start, involuntarily forcing the muscles to work and increasing the heat
production by up to a factor of 10. If equilibrium is not restored, hypothermia
can set in, which can be fatal.[53] Long-term adjustments to extreme
temperatures, of a few days to six months, may result in cardiovascular and
endocrine adjustments. A hot climate may create increased blood volume,
improving the effectiveness of vasodilation, enhanced performance of the sweat
mechanism, and the readjustment of thermal preferences. In cold or underheated
conditions, vasoconstriction can become permanent, resulting in decreased blood
volume and increased body metabolic rate.[53]
*** Behavioral Adaptation[edit] ***
In naturally ventilated buildings, occupants take numerous actions to keep
themselves comfortable when the indoor conditions drift towards discomfort.
Operating windows and fans, adjusting blinds/shades, changing clothing, and
consuming food and drinks are some of the common adaptive strategies. Among
these, adjusting windows is the most common.[54] Those occupants who take these
sorts of actions tend to feel cooler at warmer temperatures than those who do
not.[55]
The behavioral actions significantly influence energy simulation inputs, and
researchers are developing behavior models to improve the accuracy of
simulation results. For example, there are many window-opening models that have
been developed to date, but there is no consensus over the factors that trigger
window opening.[54]
People might adapt to seasonal heat by becoming more nocturnal, doing physical
activity and even conducting business at night.
***** Specificity and sensitivity[edit] *****
**** Individual differences[edit] ****
Further information: Cold_sensitivity
The thermal sensitivity of an individual is quantified by the descriptor FS,
which takes on higher values for individuals with lower tolerance to non-ideal
thermal conditions.[56] This group includes pregnant women, the disabled, as
well as individuals whose age is below fourteen or above sixty, which is
considered the adult range. Existing literature provides consistent evidence
that sensitivity to hot and cold surfaces usually declines with age. There is
also some evidence of a gradual reduction in the effectiveness of the body in
thermo-regulation after the age of sixty.[56] This is mainly due to a more
sluggish response of the counteraction mechanisms in lower parts of the body
that are used to maintain the core temperature of the body at ideal values.[56]
Seniors prefer warmer temperatures than young adults (76 vs 72 degrees F).[52]
Situational factors include the health, psychological, sociological, and
vocational activities of the persons.
**** Biological gender differences[edit] ****
While thermal comfort preferences between sexes seems to be small, there are
some differences. Studies have found males report discomfort due to rises in
temperature much earlier than females. Males also estimate higher levels of
their sensation of discomfort than females. One recent study tested males and
females in the same cotton clothing, performing mental jobs while using a dial
vote to report their thermal comfort to the changing temperature.[57] Many
times, females will prefer higher temperatures. But while females were more
sensitive to temperatures, males tend to be more sensitive to relative-humidity
levels.[58][59]
An extensive field study was carried out in naturally ventilated residential
buildings in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. This investigation explored the
sexes thermal sensitivity to the indoor environment in non air-conditioned
residential buildings. Multiple hierarchical regression for categorical
moderator was selected for data analysis; the result showed that females were
slightly more sensitive than males to the indoor air temperatures, whereas,
under thermal neutrality, it was found that males and females have similar
thermal sensation.[60]
**** Regional differences[edit] ****
In different areas of the world, thermal comfort needs may vary based on
climate. In China the climate has hot humid summers and cold winters, causing a
need for efficient thermal comfort. Energy conservation in relation to thermal
comfort has become a large issue in China in the last several decades due to
rapid economic and population growth.[61] Researchers are now looking into ways
to heat and cool buildings in China for lower costs and also with less harm to
the environment.
In tropical areas of Brazil, urbanization is causing a phenomenon called urban
heat_islands (UHI). These are urban areas that have risen over the thermal
comfort limits due to a large influx of people and only drop within the
comfortable range during the rainy season.[62] Urban heat islands can occur
over any urban city or built-up area with the correct conditions.[63] Urban
heat islands are caused by urban areas with few trees and vegetation to block
solar radiation or carry out evapotranspiration, many structures with a large
proportion of roofs, and sidewalks with low reflectivity that absorb heat, high
amounts of ground-level carbon dioxide pollution that retains heat released by
surfaces, great amounts of heat generated by air-conditioning systems of
densely packed buildings, and a large amount of automobile traffic generating
heat from engines and exhaust.[64]
In the hot humid region of Saudi_Arabia, the issue of thermal comfort has been
important in mosques where Muslims go to_pray. They are very large open
buildings that are used only intermittently (very busy for the noon_prayer on
Fridays), making it hard to ventilate them properly. The large size requires a
large amount of ventilation, but this requires a lot of energy since the
buildings are used only for short periods of time. Some mosques have the issue
of being too cold from their HVAC systems running for too long, and others
remain too hot. The stack effect also comes into play due to their large size
and creates a large layer of hot air above the people in the mosque. New
designs have placed the ventilation systems lower in the buildings to provide
more temperature control at ground level.[65] New monitoring steps are also
being taken to improve efficiency.[66]
***** Thermal stress[edit] *****
Not to be confused with thermal_stress on objects, which describes the change
materials experience when subject to extreme temperatures.
The concept of thermal comfort is closely related to thermal stress. This
attempts to predict the impact of solar_radiation, air movement, and humidity
for military personnel undergoing training exercises or athletes during
competitive events. Values are expressed as the wet_bulb_globe_temperature or
the discomfort_index.[67] Generally, humans do not perform well under thermal
stress. People's performances under thermal stress is about 11% lower than
their performance at normal thermal wet conditions. Also, human performance in
relation to thermal stress varies greatly by the type of task which the
individual is completing. Some of the physiological effects of thermal heat
stress include increased blood flow to the skin, sweating, and increased
ventilation.[68][69]
***** Research[edit] *****
The factors affecting thermal comfort were explored experimentally in the
1970s. Many of these studies led to the development and refinement of ASHRAE
Standard_55 and were performed at Kansas_State_University by Ole_Fanger and
others. Perceived comfort was found to be a complex interaction of these
variables. It was found that the majority of individuals would be satisfied by
an ideal set of values. As the range of values deviated progressively from the
ideal, fewer and fewer people were satisfied. This observation could be
expressed statistically as the percent of individuals who expressed
satisfaction by comfort conditions and the predicted mean vote (PMV). This
approach was challenged by the adaptive comfort model, developed from the
ASHRAE 884 project, which revealed that occupants were comfortable in a broader
range of temperatures.[4]
This research is applied to create Building Energy Simulation (BES) programs
for residential buildings. Residential buildings in particular can vary much
more in thermal comfort than public and commercial buildings. This is due to
their smaller size, the variations in clothing worn, and different uses of each
room. The main rooms of concern are bathrooms and bedrooms. Bathrooms need to
be at a temperature comfortable for a human with or without clothing. Bedrooms
are of importance because they need to accommodate different levels of clothing
and also different metabolic rates of people asleep or awake.[70] Discomfort
hours is a common metric used to evaluate the thermal performance of a space.
Thermal comfort research in clothing is currently being done by the military.
New air-ventilated garments are being researched to improve evaporative cooling
in military settings. Some models are being created and tested based on the
amount of cooling they provide.[71]
In the last twenty years, researchers have also developed advanced thermal
comfort models that divide the human body into many segments, and predict local
thermal discomfort by considering heat balance.[72][73][74] This has opened up
a new arena of thermal comfort modeling that aims at heating/cooling selected
body parts.
**** Medical environments[edit] ****
                        This section relies largely or entirely on a single
[Question_book-new.svg] source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk
                        page. Please help improve_this_article by introducing
                        citations to additional sources. (June 2016)
Whenever the studies referenced tried to discuss the thermal conditions for
different groups of occupants in one room, the studies ended up simply
presenting comparisons of thermal comfort satisfaction based on the subjective
studies. No study tried to reconcile the different thermal comfort requirements
of different types of occupants who compulsorily must stay in one room.
Therefore, it looks to be necessary to investigate the different thermal
conditions required by different groups of occupants in hospitals to reconcile
their different requirements in this concept. To reconcile the differences in
the required thermal comfort conditions it is recommended to test the
possibility of using different ranges of local radiant temperature in one room
via a suitable mechanical system.
Although different researches are undertaken on thermal comfort for patients in
hospitals, it is also necessary to study the effects of thermal comfort
conditions on the quality and the quantity of healing for patients in
hospitals. There are also original researches that show the link between
thermal comfort for staff and their levels of productivity, but no studies have
been produced individually in hospitals in this field. Therefore, research for
coverage and methods individually for this subject is recommended. Also
research in terms of cooling and heating delivery systems for patients with low
levels of immune-system protection (such as HIV patients, burned patients,
etc.) are recommended. There are important areas, which still need to be
focused on including thermal comfort for staff and its relation with their
productivity, using different heating systems to prevent hypothermia in the
patient and to improve the thermal comfort for hospital staff simultaneously.
Finally, the interaction between people, systems and architectural design in
hospitals is a field in which require further work needed to improve the
knowledge of how to design buildings and systems to reconcile many conflicting
factors for the people occupying these buildings.[75]
**** Personal comfort systems[edit] ****
Personal comfort systems (PCS) refer to devices or systems which heat or cool a
building occupant personally.[76] This concept is best appreciated in contrast
to central HVAC systems which have uniform temperature settings for extensive
areas. Personal comfort systems include fans and air diffusers of various kinds
(e.g. desk fans, nozzles and slot diffusers, overhead fans, high-volume_low-
speed_fans etc.) and personalized sources of radiant or conductive heat
(footwarmers, legwarmers, hot water bottles etc.). PCS has the potential to
satisfy individual comfort requirements much better than current HVAC systems,
as interpersonal differences in thermal sensation due to age, sex, body mass,
metabolic rate, clothing and thermal adaptation can amount to an equivalent
temperature variation of 2-5 K, which is impossible for a central, uniform HVAC
system to cater to.[76] Besides, research has shown that the perceived ability
to control one's thermal environment tends to widen one's range of tolerable
temperatures.[4] Traditionally, PCS devices have been used in isolation from
one another. However, it has been proposed by Andersen et al. (2016) that a
network of PCS devices which generate well-connected microzones of thermal
comfort, and report real-time occupant information and respond to programmatic
actuation requests (e.g. a party, a conference, a concert etc.) can combine
with occupant-aware building applications to enable new methods of comfort
maximization.[77]
