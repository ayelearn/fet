Affordable housing or Low income housing at the St._James_Town neighborhood in
Toronto,_Ontario, Canada.
Affordable housing is housing which is deemed affordable to those with a median
household_income or below[1] as rated by the national_government or a local
government by a recognized housing_affordability_index. Most of the literature
on affordable housing refers to mortgages and number of forms that exist along
a continuum â from emergency shelters, to transitional housing, to non-market
rental (also known as social or subsidized_housing), to formal and informal
rental, indigenous housing, and ending with affordable home ownership.[2][3][4]
[5]
In Australia, the National Affordable Housing Summit Group developed their
definition of affordable housing as housing that is "...reasonably adequate in
standard and location for lower or middle income households and does not cost
so much that a household is unlikely to be able to meet other basic needs on a
sustainable basis."[6] Affordable_housing_in_the_United_Kingdom includes
"social rented and intermediate housing, provided to specified eligible
households whose needs are not met by the market."[7]
The notion of housing affordability became widespread in the 1980s in Europe
and North America. In the words of Alain Bertaud, of New York University and
former principal planner at the World Bank,
     "It is time for planners to abandon abstract objectives and to focus
     their efforts on two measurable outcomes that have always mattered
     since the growth of large cities during the 19th centuryâs
     industrial revolution: workersâ spatial mobility and housing
     affordability."[8]
Housing choice is a response to an extremely complex set of economic, social,
and psychological impulses.[9] For example, some households may choose to spend
more on housing because they feel they can afford to, while others may not have
a choice.[10]

***** Measuring housing affordability[edit] *****
**** Median Multiple[edit] ****
The Median_Multiple indicator, recommended by the World_Bank and the United
Nations, rates affordability of housing by dividing the median house price by
gross [before tax] annual median household income).
     "A common measure of community-wide affordability is the number of
     homes that a household with a certain percentage of median_income can
     afford. For example, in a perfectly balanced housing market, the
     median household (the wealthier half of households) could officially
     afford the median housing option, while those poorer than the median
     income could not afford the median home. 50% affordability for the
     median home indicates a balanced market."[1]
Determining housing affordability is complex and the commonly used housing-
expenditure-to-income-ratio tool has been challenged. In the United States[11]
[12] and Canada,[13] a commonly accepted guideline for housing affordability is
a housing cost that does not exceed 30% of a household's gross_income. Canada,
for example, switched to a 25% rule from a 20% rule in the 1950s. In the 1980s
this was replaced by a 30% rule.[9] India uses a 40% rule.
**** Housing Affordability Index (HAI)[edit] ****
Main article: Housing_Affordability_Index
One of the greatest strengths of the HAI developed by MIT is its ability to
capture the Total Cost of Ownership of individuals' housing choices. In
computing the index the obvious cost of rents and mortgage payments are
modified by the hidden costs of those choices.[14][15]
***** Household income and wealth[edit] *****
Income is the primary factor – not price and availability, that determines
housing affordability.[16] In a market economy the distribution of income is
the key determinant of the quantity and quality of housing obtained. Therefore,
understanding affordable housing challenges requires understanding trends and
disparities_in_income_and_wealth. Housing is often the single biggest
expenditure of low and middle income families. For low and middle income
families, their house is also the greatest source of wealth.[17]
The most common approach to measure the affordability of housing has been to
consider the percentage of income that a household spends on housing
expenditures. Another method of studying affordability looks at the regular
hourly wage of full-time workers who are paid only the minimum wage (as set by
their local, regional, or national government). The hope is that full-time
workers will be able to afford at least a small apartment in the area where
they work. Some countries look at those living in relative_poverty, which is
usually defined as making less than 60% of the median_household_income. In
their policy reports, they consider the presence or absence of housing for
people making 60% of the median income.
***** Housing expenditures[edit] *****
Housing affordability can be measured by the changing relationships between
house prices and rents, and between house prices and incomes.[18] There has
been an increase among policy makers in affordable housing as the price of
housing has increased dramatically creating a crisis in affordable housing.[19]
Since 2000 the "world experienced an unprecedented house price boom in terms of
magnitude and duration, but also of synchronisation across countries."[20]
"Never before had house prices risen so fast, for so long, in so many
countries."[18] Prices doubled in many countries and nearly tripled in Ireland.
The bursting of the biggest financial bubble in history in 2008 wreaked havoc
globally on the housing market. By 2011 home prices in Ireland had plunged by
45% from their peak in 2007. In the United States prices fell by 34% while
foreclosures increased exponentially. In Spain and Denmark home prices dropped
by 15%. However, in spite of the bust, home prices continue to be overvalued by
about 25% or more in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, Britain,
the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.[18]
**** Causes and consequences of rise in house prices[edit] ****
Costs are being driven by a number of factors including:
    * demographics shifts
          o the declining number of people per dwelling
          o Growing Density Convergence, Regional Urbanization
          o solid population growth (for example sky-high prices in Australia
            and Canada as a rising population pushes up demand).[18]
    * supply and demand
          o a shortfall in the number of dwellings to the number of households
                # smaller family size
                # the strong psychological desire for home ownership,[21]
    * shifts in economic policies and innovations in financial instruments
          o reduced profitability of other forms of investment
          o availability of housing finance[20]
          o low interest rates[20]
          o mortgage market innovations[20]
    * public policy
          o deregulation
          o land use zoning
          o significant taxes' levies and fees by Government on new housing
            (especially in Australia)
*** Inequality and housing[edit] ***
A number of researchers argue that a shortage of affordable housing â at
least in the US â is caused in part by income inequality.[22][23][24] David
Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units
decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased.[22]:148 Through
gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental
prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher
market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.
The ad_valorem_property_tax policy combined with rising prices made it
difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.[25]
**** Other housing expenditures[edit] ****
In measuring affordability of housing there are various expenditures beyond the
price of the actual housing stock itself, that are considered depending on the
index being used.
Some organizations and agencies consider the cost of purchasing a single-family
home; others look exclusively at the cost of renting an apartment.
Many U.S. studies, for example, focus primarily on the median cost of renting a
two-bedroom apartment in a large apartment complex for a new tenant. These
studies often lump together luxury apartments and slums, as well as desirable
and undesirable neighborhoods. While this practice is known to distort the true
costs, it is difficult to provide accurate information for the wide variety of
situations without the report being unwieldy.
Normally, only legal, permitted, separate housing is considered when
calculating the cost of housing. The low rent costs for a room in a single
family home, or an illegal garage conversion, or a college dormitory are
generally excluded from the calculation, no matter how many people in an area
live in such situations. Because of this study methodology, median housing
costs tend to be slightly inflated.
Costs are generally considered on a cash (not accrual) basis. Thus a person
making the last payment on a large home mortgage might live in officially
unaffordable housing one month, and very affordable housing the following
month, when the mortgage is paid off. This distortion can be significant in
areas where real estate costs are high, even if incomes are similarly high,
because a high income allows a higher proportion of the income to be dedicated
towards buying an expensive home without endangering the household's ability to
buy food or other basic necessities.
***** Growing density convergence and regional urbanization[edit] *****
The majority of the more than seven billion people on earth now live in cities
(UN). There are more than 500 city regions of more than one million inhabitants
in the world. Cities become megacities become megalopolitan city regions and
even "galaxies" of more than 60 million inhabitants. The Yangtze Delta-Greater
Shanghai region now surpasses 80 million. Tokyo-Yokohama adjacent to Osaka-
Kobe-Kyoto have a combined population of 100 million. Rapid population growth
leads to increased need for affordable housing in most cities. The availability
of affordable housing in proximity of mass transit and linked to job
distribution has become severely imbalanced in this period of rapid regional
urbanization and growing density convergence.
"In addition to the distress it causes families who cannot find a place to
live, lack of affordable housing is considered by many urban planners to have
negative effects on a community's overall health."[26]
Affordable housing challenges in inner cities range from the homeless who are
forced to live on the street to the relative deprivation of vital workers like
police officers, firefighters, teachers and nurses unable to find affordable
accommodation near their place of work. These workers are forced to live in
suburbia, commuting up to two hours each way to work.[27] Lack of affordable
housing can make low-cost labour scarcer (as workers travel longer distances)
(Pollard and Stanley 2007).[26]
***** Economy[edit] *****
Lack of affordable housing places a particular burden on local economies.
As well, individual consumers are faced with mortgage arrears and excessive
debt and therefore cut back on consumption. A combination of high housing costs
and high debt levels contributes to a reduction in savings.
These factors can lead to decreased investment in sectors that are essential to
the long-term growth of the economy.
**** Supply and demand[edit] ****
In some countries, the market has been unable to meet the growing demand to
supply housing stock at affordable prices. Although demand for affordable
housing, particularly rental housing that is affordable for low and middle
income earners, has increased, the supply has not.[28][29][30][31] Potential
home buyers are forced to turn to the rental market, which is also under
pressure.[32] An inadequate supply of housing stock increases demand on the
private and social rented sector, and in worse case scenarios, homelessness.
[19]
**** Some of the factors that affect the supply and demand of housing stock
[edit] ****
    * Demographic and behavioural factors
    * Migration (to cities and potential employment)
    * Increased life expectancy
    * Building codes[33]
    * A greater propensity for people to live alone
    * Young adults delaying forming their own household (in advanced
      economies).
    * Exclusionary zoning
**** Factors that affect tenure choices (ex. owner occupier, private rented,
social rented)[edit] ****
    * Employment rates
          o Rising unemployment rates increase demand for market rentals,
            social housing and homelessness.
    * Real household incomes
          o Household incomes have not kept up with rising housing prices
    * Affordability of rents and owner occupation
    * Interest rates
    * Availability of mortgages
    * Levels of confidence in the economy and housing market
          o Low confidence decreases demand for owner occupation[19]
***** Labour market performance[edit] *****
In both large metropolitan areas and regional towns where housing prices are
high, a lack of affordable housing places local firms at a competitive
disadvantage. They are placed under wage pressures as they attempt to decrease
the income/housing price gap. Key workers have fewer housing choices if prices
rise to non-affordable levels. Variations in affordability of housing between
areas may create labour market impediments.
Potential workers are discouraged from moving to employment in areas of low
affordability. They are also discouraged from migrating to areas of high
affordability as the low house prices and rents indicate low capital gain
potential and poor employment prospects.[34]
***** Social costs of lack of affordable housing[edit] *****
Housing affordability is more than just a personal trouble experienced by
individual households who cannot easily find a place to live. Lack of
affordable housing is considered by many urban_planners to have negative
effects on a community's overall health.[35]
**** Jobs, transportation, and affordable housing[edit] ****
Main article: Workforce_housing
Lack of affordable housing can make low-cost labor more scarce, and increase
demands on transportation systems (as workers travel longer distances between
jobs and affordable housing). Housing cost increases in U.S. cities[36][37]
have been linked to declines in enrollment at local schools.[38]
"Faced with few affordable options, many people attempt to find less expensive
housing by buying or renting farther out, but long commutes often result in
higher transportation costs that erase any savings on shelter." Pollard (2010)
called this the "drive 'til you qualify" approach, which causes far-flung
development and forces people to drive longer distances to get to work, to get
groceries, to take children to school, or to engage in other activities.[39] A
well located dwelling might save significant household travel costs and
therefore improve overall family economics, even if the rent is higher than a
dwelling in a poorer location.[6]
A household's inhabitants must decide whether to pay more for housing to keep
commuting time and expense low, or to accept a long or expensive commute to
obtain "better" housing. The absolute availability of housing is not generally
considered in the calculation of affordable housing. In a depressed or sparsely
settled rural area, for example, the predicted price of the canonical median
two-bedroom apartment may be quite easily affordable even to a minimum-wage
worker â if only any apartments had ever been built. Some affordable housing
prototypes include Nano_House and Affordable Green Tiny House Project.[citation

***** Affordable housing and public policy[edit] *****
Policy makers at all levels â global, national, regional, municipal,
community associations â are attempting to respond to the issue of affordable
housing, a highly complex crisis of global proportions, with a myriad of policy
instruments. These responses range from stop-gap financing tools to long-term
intergovernmental[40] infrastructural changes.
In the simplest of terms, affordability of housing refers to the amount of
capital one has available in relation to the price of the goods to be obtained.
Public policies are informed by underlying assumptions about the nature of
housing itself. Is housing a basic need, a right,[41][42] an entitlement, or a
public good? Or is just another household-level consumer choice, a commodity or
an investment within the free market system? "Housing Policies provide a
remarkable litmus test for the values of politicians at every level of office
and of the varied communities that influence them. Often this test measures
simply the warmth or coldness of heart of the more affluent and secure towards
families of a lower socio-economic status (Bacher 1993:16)."[43]
Affordable housing needs can be addressed through public policy instruments
that focus on the demand side of the market, programs that help households
reach financial benchmarks that make housing affordable. This can include
approaches that simply promote economic growth in general – in the hope that a
stronger economy, higher employment rates, and higher wages will increase the
ability of households to acquire housing at market prices. Federal government
policies define banking and mortgage lending practices, tax and regulatory
measures affecting building materials, professional practices (ex. real estate
transactions).[40] The purchasing power of individual households can be
enhanced through tax and fiscal policies that result in reducing the cost of
mortgages and the cost of borrowing. Public policies may include the
implementation of subsidy programs and incentive patterns for average
households.[40] For the most vulnerable groups, such as seniors, single-parent
families, the disabled, etc. some form of publicly funded allowance strategy
can be implemented providing individual households with adequate income to
afford housing.
Currently, policies that facilitate production on the supply side include
favorable land use policies such as inclusionary_zoning, relaxation of
environmental regulations, and the enforcement of affordable housing quotas in
new developments.
In some countries, such as Canada, municipal governments began to play a
greater role in developing and implementing policies regarding form and density
of municipal housing in residential districts, as early as the 1950s.[40] At
the municipal level recently[when?] promoted policy tools include relaxation of
prohibitions against accessory_dwelling_units, and reduction of the amount of
parking that must be built for a new structure.
Affordable housing is a controversial reality of contemporary life, for gains
in affordability often result from expanding land available for housing or
increasing the density of housing units in a given area. Ensuring a steady
supply of affordable housing means ensuring that communities weigh real and
perceived livability impacts against the sheer necessity of affordability. The
process of weighing the impacts of locating affordable housing is quite
contentious, and is laden with_race_and_class_implications. Recent research,
however, suggests that proximity to low-income housing developments generally
has a positive impact on neighborhood property conditions.[44]
The growing gap between rich and poor since the 1980s manifests itself in a
housing system where public policy decisions privilege the ownership sector to
the disadvantage of the rental sector.[40]
Ann Owen wonders if the housing market helped reduced poverty concentration in
the National longitudinal data between the years of 1977â2008 with
concentration of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Data
information is to compare or intertwine with the differences of national
housing subsidies, the entry, exit, and enhancement of low income housing.[45]
**** Right to build[edit] ****
An article by libertarian writer Virginia Postrel in the November 2007 issue of
Atlantic_Monthly reported on a study of the cost of obtaining the "right to
build" (i.e. a building permit, red tape, bureaucracy, etc.) in different U.S.
cities. The "right to build" cost does not include the cost of the land or the
cost of constructing the house. The study was conducted by Harvard economists
Edward Glaeser and Kristina Tobio. According to the chart accompanying the
article, the cost of obtaining the "right to build" adds approximately $600,000
to the cost of each new house that is built in San Francisco. The study, cited,
published by Ed Glaeser and Joe Gyourko, reached its conclusion about the value
of right to build in different localities based on a methodology of comparing
the cost of single family homes on quarter-acre versus half-acre lots to get a
marginal land price and then comparing the selling price of homes to
construction costs to get a price for land plus other costs, with the
difference between the two being attributed to the cost of zoning and other
local government permitting and regulations.[46]
**** Government restrictions on affordable housing[edit] ****
Many governments put restrictions on the size or cost of a dwelling that people
can live in,[citation_needed] making it essentially illegal to live permanently
in a house that is too small, low-cost or not compliant with other government-
defined requirements. Generally, these laws are implemented in an attempt to
raise the perceived "standard" of housing across the country. This can lead to
thousands of houses across a country being left empty for much of the year even
when there is a great need for more affordable housing; such is the case in
countries like Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, where there is a common
tradition to have a summer_house. This sometimes raises concerns for the
respect of rights such as the right_to_utilize_one's_property.
In the United States, most cities have zoning codes that set the minimum size
for a housing unit (often 400 square feet) as well as the number of non-related
persons who can live together in one unit, resulting in having "outlawed the
bottom end of the private housing market, driving up rents on everything above
it." [47]
