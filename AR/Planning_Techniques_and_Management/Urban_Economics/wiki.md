Urban economics is broadly the economic study of urban_areas; as such, it
involves using the tools of economics to analyze urban issues such as crime,
education, public transit, housing, and local government finance. More
narrowly, it is a branch of microeconomics that studies urban spatial structure
and the location of households and firms (Quigley_2008).
Much urban economic analysis relies on a particular model of urban spatial
structure, the monocentric city model pioneered in the 1960s by William_Alonso,
Richard_Muth, and Edwin_Mills. While most other forms of neoclassical_economics
do not account for spatial relationships between individuals and organizations,
urban economics focuses on these spatial relationships to understand the
economic motivations underlying the formation, functioning, and development of
cities.
Since its formulation in 1964, Alonso's_monocentric_city_model of a disc-shaped
Central_Business_District (CBD) and surrounding residential region has served
as a starting point for urban economic analysis. Monocentricity has weakened
over time because of changes in technology, particularly, faster and cheaper
transportation (which makes it possible for commuters to live farther from
their jobs in the CBD) and communications (which allow back-office operations
to move out of the CBD).
Additionally, recent research has sought to explain the polycentricity
described in Joel_Garreau's Edge_City. Several explanations for polycentric
expansion have been proposed and summarized in models that account for factors
such as utility gains from lower average land rents and increasing (or constant
returns) due to economies_of_agglomeration (Strange_2008).

***** Introduction[edit] *****
Urban economics is rooted in the location theories of von_ThÃ¼nen, Alonso,
Christaller, and LÃ¶sch that began the process of spatial economic analysis
(Capello_&_Nijkamp_2004:3â4). Economics is the study of the allocation of
scarce resources, and as all economic phenomena take place within a
geographical space, urban economics focuses on the allocation of resources
across space in relation to urban areas (Arnott_&_McMillen_2006:7) (McCann
2001:1). Other branches of economics ignore the spatial aspects of decision
making but urban economics focuses not only on the location decisions of firms,
but also of cities themselves as cities themselves represent centers of
economic activity (O'Sullivan_2003:1).
Many spatial economic topics can be analyzed within either an urban or regional
economics framework as some economic phenomena primarily affect localized urban
areas while others are felt over much larger regional areas (McCann_2001:3).
Arthur O'Sullivan believes urban economics is divided into six related themes:
market forces in the development of cities, land use within cities, urban
transportation, urban problems and public policy, housing and public policy,
and local government expenditures and taxes. (O'Sullivan_2003:13â14).
***** Market forces in the development of cities[edit] *****
Market forces in the development of cities relate to how the location decision
of firms and households causes the development of cities. The nature and
behavior of markets depends somewhat on their locations therefore market
performance partly depends on geography.(McCann_2001:1). If a firm locates in a
geographically isolated region, their market performance will be different than
a firm located in a concentrated region. The location decisions of both firms
and households create cities that differ in size and economic structure. When
industries cluster, like in the Silicon Valley in California, they create urban
areas with dominant firms and distinct economies.
By looking at location decisions of firms and households, the urban economist
is able to address why cities develop where they do, why some cities are large
and others small, what causes economic growth and decline, and how local
governments affect urban growth (O'Sullivan_2003:14). Because urban economics
is concerned with asking questions about the nature and workings of the economy
of a city, models and techniques developed within the field are primarily
designed to analyze phenomena that are confined within the limits of a single
city (McCann_2001:2).
***** Land use[edit] *****
Looking at land use within metropolitan areas, the urban economist seeks to
analyze the spatial organization of activities within cities. In attempts to
explain observed patterns of land use, the urban economist examines the intra-
city location choices of firms and households. Considering the spatial
organization of activities within cities, urban economics addresses questions
in terms of what determines the price of land and why those prices vary across
space, the economic forces that caused the spread of employment from the
central core of cities outward, identifying land-use controls, such as zoning,
and interpreting how such controls affect the urban economy (O'Sullivan_2003:
14).
***** Economic policy[edit] *****
Economic policy is often implemented at the urban level thus economic policy is
often tied to urban policy (McCann_2001:3). Urban problems and public policy
tie into urban economics as the theme relates urban problems, such as poverty
or crime, to economics by seeking to answer questions with economic guidance.
For example, does the tendency for the poor to live close to one another make
them even poorer? (O'Sullivan_2003:15).
***** Transportation and economics[edit] *****
Urban transportation is a theme of urban economics because it affects land-use
patterns as transportation affects the relative accessibility of different
sites. Issues that tie urban transportation to urban economics include the
deficit that most transit authorities have, and efficiency questions about
proposed transportation developments such as light-rail (O'Sullivan_2003:14).
Megaprojects such as this have been shown to be synonymous with unexpected
costs and questionable benefits.[1]
***** Housing and public policy[edit] *****
Housing and public policy relate to urban economics as housing is a unique type
of commodity. Because housing is immobile, when a household chooses a dwelling,
it is also choosing a location. Urban economists analyze the location choices
of households in conjunction with the market effects of housing policies
(O'Sullivan_2003:15). In analyzing housing policies, we make use of market
structures e.g., perfect market structure. There are however problems
encountered in making this analysis such as funding, uncertainty, space, etc.
***** Government expenditures and taxes[edit] *****
The final theme of local government expenditures and taxes relates to urban
economics as it analyzes the efficiency of the fragmented local governments
presiding in metropolitan areas (O'Sullivan_2003:15).
