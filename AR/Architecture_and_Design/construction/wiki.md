Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure.[1]
Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically
involves mass_production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while
construction typically takes place on location for a known client.[2]
Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross_domestic
product of developed_countries.[3] Construction starts with planning, design,
and financing; it continues until the project is built and ready for use.
Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines. A
project_manager normally manages the job, and a construction_manager, design
engineer, construction_engineer or architect supervises it. Those involved with
the design and execution must consider zoning requirements, environmental
impact of the job, scheduling, budgeting, construction-site_safety,
availability and transportation of building_materials, logistics, inconvenience
to the public caused by construction_delays and bidding. Large construction
projects are sometimes referred to as megaprojects.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
Construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects,
systems, or organizations,[4] and comes from Latin constructio (from com-
"together" and struere "to pile up") and Old French construction.[5] To
construct is the verb: the act of building, and the noun construction: how a
building was built, the nature of its structure.
***** Types[edit] *****

In general, there are three sectors of construction: buildings, infrastructure
and industrial.[6] Building construction is usually further divided into
residential and non-residential (commercial/institutional). Infrastructure is
often called heavy_civil_or_heavy_engineering that includes large public works,
dams, bridges, highways, railways, water or wastewater and utility
distribution. Industrial construction includes refineries, process chemical,
power_generation, mills and manufacturing_plants. There are also other ways to
break the industry into sectors or markets.[7]
**** Industry sectors[edit] ****
Military residential unit construction by U.S. Navy personnel in Afghanistan

Engineering_News-Record (ENR), a trade magazine for the construction industry,
each year compiles and reports data about the size of design and construction
companies. In 2014, ENR compiled the data in nine market segments divided as
transportation, petroleum, buildings, power, industrial, water, manufacturing,
sewer/waste, telecom, hazardous waste and a tenth category for other projects.
[8] In their reporting, they used data on transportation, sewer, hazardous
waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors.[9]
The Standard_Industrial_Classification and the newer North_American_Industry
Classification_System have a classification system for companies that perform
or engage in construction. To recognize the differences of companies in this
sector, it is divided into three subsectors: building construction, heavy and
civil_engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. There are also
categories for construction service firms (e.g., engineering, architecture) and
construction managers (firms engaged in managing construction projects without
assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction
project).[10][11]

Building construction is the process of adding structure to real_property or
construction of buildings. The majority of building construction jobs are small
renovations, such as addition of a room, or renovation of a bathroom. Often,
the owner of the property acts as laborer, paymaster, and design team for the
entire project.[12] Although building construction projects consist of common
elements such as design, financial, estimating and legal considerations,
projects of varying sizes may reach undesirable end results, such as structural
collapse, cost overruns, and/or litigation. For this reason, those with
experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight
during the project to ensure a positive outcome.

Commercial building construction is procured privately or publicly utilizing
various delivery methodologies, including cost estimating, hard bid, negotiated
price, traditional, management contracting, construction management-at-risk,
design & build and design-build bridging.
Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to
local building authority regulations and codes_of_practice. Materials readily
available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used (e.g.
brick versus stone, versus timber). Cost of construction on a per square meter
(or per square foot) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site
conditions, local regulations, economies_of_scale (custom designed homes are
often more expensive to build) and the availability of skilled tradesmen.
Residential construction as well as other types of construction can generate
waste such that planning is required.
According to McKinsey research, productivity growth per worker in construction
has lagged behind many other industries across different countries including in
the United_States and in European countries. In the United States, construction
productivity per worker has declined by half since the 1960s.[13]

Framing
The most popular method of residential construction in North_America is wood-
framed construction. Typical construction steps for a single-family or small
multi-family house are:
    * Obtain an engineered soil test of lot where construction is planned. From
      an engineer or company specializing in soil testing.
    * Develop floor_plans and obtain a materials list for estimations (more
      recently performed with estimating_software)
    * Obtain structural engineered plans for foundation and structure. To be
      completed by either a licensed engineer or architect. To include both a
      foundation and framing plan.
    * Obtain lot survey
    * Obtain government building approval if necessary
    * If required obtain approval from HOA (homeowners association) or ARC
      (architectural review committee)
    * Clear the building site (demolition of existing home if necessary)
    * Survey to stake out for the foundation
    * Excavate the foundation and dig footers (Scope of work is dependent of
      foundation designed by engineer)
    * Install plumbing grounds
    * Pour a foundation and footers with concrete
    * Build the main load-bearing structure out of thick pieces of wood and
      possibly metal I-beams for large spans with few supports. See framing_
      (construction)
    * Add floor and ceiling joists and install subfloor panels
    * Cover outer walls and roof in OSB or plywood and a water-resistive
      barrier.
    * Install roof_shingles or other covering for flat_roof
    * Cover the walls with siding, typically vinyl, wood, or brick_veneer but
      possibly stone or other materials
    * Install windows
    * Frame interior walls with wooden 2Ã4s
    * Add internal plumbing, HVAC, electrical, and natural_gas utilities
    * Building inspector visits if necessary to approve utilities and framing
    * Install insulation and interior drywall panels (cementboard for wet
      areas) and to complete walls and ceilings
    * Install bathroom fixtures
    * Spackle, prime, and paint interior walls and ceilings
    * Additional tiling on top of cementboard for wet areas, such as the
      bathroom and kitchen backsplash
    * Installation of final floor covering, such as floor tile, carpet, or wood
      flooring
    * Installation of major_appliances
    * Unless the original owners are building the house, at this point it is
      typically sold or rented.

In the industrialized world, construction usually involves the translation of
designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to plan the
physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts.
The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually prepared by
a design team including architect, civil_engineers, mechanical_engineers,
electrical_engineers, structural_engineers, fire_protection_engineers, planning
consultants, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The
design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property
owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a
number of construction companies or construction management companies may then
be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on
the basis of drawings and a bill_of_quantities provided by a quantity_surveyor.
Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most
cost efficient bidder.
The best modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated
specialties, especially among large firms. In the past, architects, interior
designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general
contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the
larger firms. Presently, a firm that is nominally an "architecture" or
"construction management" firm may have experts from all related fields as
employees, or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill.
Thus, each such firm may offer itself as "one-stop shopping" for a construction
project, from beginning to end. This is designated as a "design build" contract
where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake
the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance
specifications.[14]
Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration, including
design-build, partnering and construction management. In general, each of these
project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects,
interior designers, engineers and constructors throughout design and
construction. In response, many companies are growing beyond traditional
offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more
emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants
through the design-build process.
The increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design
professionals trained in all phases of the project's life-cycle and develop an
appreciation of the building as an advanced technological system requiring
close integration of many sub-systems and their individual components,
including sustainability. Building_engineering is an emerging discipline that
attempts to meet this new challenge.

Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems. Underbids
happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project. Cash
flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current
costs for labour and materials, and because they are a matter of having
sufficient funds at a specific time, can arise even when the overall total is
enough. Fraud is a problem in many fields, but is notoriously prevalent in the
construction field.[15] Financial planning for the project is intended to
ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in
place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is
properly executed over the life of the project.
Mortgage_bankers, accountants, and cost_engineers are likely participants in
creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building
construction project. The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely,
even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is
the most obvious source of funding for a building project. Accountants act to
study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor
the payouts throughout the process. Cost engineers and estimators apply
expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation. Cost
overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified
change orders or project changes that increased costs, which are not subject to
competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from
consideration after the initial bid.[16]
Large projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with
a conceptual estimate performed by a building_estimator. As portions of a
project are completed, they may be sold, supplanting one lender or owner for
another, while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and
materials available for each stage of the building construction project carries
forward. In many English-speaking countries, but not the United States,
projects typically use quantity surveyors.

Main article: Construction_law

travel lanes
A construction project must fit into the legal framework governing the
property. These include governmental regulations on the use of property, and
obligations that are created in the process of construction.
When applicable, the project must adhere to zoning and building_code
requirements. Constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not
benefit the owner. Some legal requirements come from malum_in_se
considerations, or the desire to prevent indisputably bad phenomena, e.g.
explosions or bridge collapses. Other legal requirements come from malum
prohibitum considerations, or factors that are a matter of custom or
expectation, such as isolating businesses from a business district or
residences from a residential district. An attorney may seek changes or
exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built,
either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable (the bridge design will not cause
a collapse), or that the custom is no longer needed (acceptance of live-work
spaces has grown in the community).[17]
A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal
obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is
the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not
so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as
possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in
construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the
delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to
ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out.
Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing
those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing
smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.
Legal advisors in the beginning of a construction project seek to identify
ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structure,
and to present options for preventing problems. Throughout the process of the
project, they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise. In each case, the
lawyer facilitates an exchange of obligations that matches the reality of the
project.
**** Interaction of expertise[edit] ****

Design, finance, and legal aspects overlap and interrelate. The design must be
not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location, but must
also be financially possible to build, and legal to use. The financial
structure must accommodate the need for building the design provided, and must
pay amounts that are legally owed. The legal structure must integrate the
design into the surrounding legal framework, and enforce the financial
consequences of the construction process.
**** Procurement[edit] ****
Procurement describes the merging of activities undertaken by the client to
obtain a building. There are many different methods of construction
procurement; however, the three most common types of procurement are
traditional (designâbidâbuild), design-build and management contracting.
[18]
There is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve
relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship
among the principal, the contractor, and other stakeholders within a
construction project. New forms include partnering such as Public-Private
Partnering (PPPs) aka private_finance_initiatives (PFIs) and alliances such as
"pure" or "project" alliances and "impure" or "strategic" alliances. The focus
on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often
highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry.
*** Traditional[edit] ***
Main article: Designâbidâbuild
This is the most common method of construction procurement, and it is well-
established and recognized. In this arrangement, the architect or engineer acts
as the project coordinator. His or her role is to design the works, prepare the
specifications and produce construction drawings, administer the contract,
tender the works, and manage the works from inception to completion. There are
direct contractual links between the architect's client and the main
contractor. Any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the
main contractor. The procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy.
*** Design-build[edit] ***
Main article: Design-build
Construction of the Phase-1 (first two towers) of the
Havelock_City_Project, Sri_Lanka
This approach has become more common in recent years, and also involves the
client contracting a single entity that both provides a design and builds it.
In some cases, the design-build package can also include finding the site,
arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory consents.
The owner produces a list of requirements for a project, giving an overall view
of the project's goals. Several D&B contractors present different ideas about
how to accomplish these goals. The owner selects the ideas they like best and
hires the appropriate contractor. Often, it is not just one contractor, but a
consortium of several contractors working together. Once these have been hired,
they begin building the first phase of the project. As they build phase 1, they
design phase 2. This is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract, where the
project is completely designed by the owner, then bid on, then completed.
Kent Hansen pointed out that state departments_of_transportation usually use
design build contracts as a way of progressing projects when states lack the
skills-resources. In such departments, design build contracts are usually
employed for very large projects.[19]
*** Management procurement systems[edit] ***
Main article: Construction_management
In this arrangement the client plays an active role in the procurement system
by entering into separate contracts with the designer (architect or engineer),
the construction_manager, and individual trade_contractors. The client takes on
the contractual role, while the construction or project manager provides the
active role of managing the separate trade contracts, and ensuring that they
complete all work smoothly and effectively together.
Management procurement systems are often used to speed up the procurement
processes, allow the client greater flexibility in design variation throughout
the contract, give the ability to appoint individual work contractors, separate
contractual responsibility on each individual throughout the contract, and to
provide greater client control.
In recent time, construction software starts to get tractionâas it digitizes
construction industry. Among solutions, there are for example: Procore,
GenieBelt, PlanGrid, bouw7, etc.
**** Sustainability in construction[edit] ****
Main article: Sustainability_in_construction
Sustainability during the construction phase is one of the aspects of âgreen
building," defined by the United States Environmental_Protection_Agency (EPA)
as "the practice of creating structures and using processes that are
environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's
life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance,
renovation and deconstruction."[20]
***** Authority having jurisdiction[edit] *****
See also: Planning_permission
Digging the foundation for a building construction in Jakarta, Indonesia
In construction, the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) is the governmental
agency or sub-agency that regulates the construction process. In most cases,
this is the municipality where the building is located. However, construction
performed for supra-municipal authorities are usually regulated directly by the
owning authority, which becomes the AHJ.

Before the foundation can be dug, contractors are typically required to verify
and have existing utility lines marked, either by the utilities themselves or
through a company specializing in such services. This lessens the likelihood of
damage to the existing electrical, water, sewage, phone, and cable facilities,
which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations. During the
construction of a building, the municipal building inspector inspects the
building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved
plans and the local building_code. Once construction is complete and a final
inspection has been passed, an occupancy permit may be issued.
An operating building must remain in compliance with the fire_code. The fire
code is enforced by the local fire department or a municipal code enforcement
office.
Changes made to a building that affect safety, including its use, expansion,
structural integrity, and fire_protection items, usually require approval of
the AHJ for review concerning the building code.
***** Industry characteristics[edit] *****
In the United States, the industry in 2014 has around $960 billion in annual
revenue according to statistics tracked by the Census_Bureau, of which $680
billion is private (split evenly between residential and nonresidential) and
the remainder is government.[21] In 2005, there were about 667,000 firms
employing 1 million contractors (200,000 general contractors, 38,000 heavy, and
432,000 specialty); the average contractor employed fewer than 10 employees.
[22] As a whole, the industry employed an estimated 5.8 million in April 2013,
with a 13.2% unemployment rate.[23] In the United States, approximately 828,000
women were employed in the construction industry as of 2011.[24]

There are many routes to the different careers within the construction
industry. These three main tiers are based on educational background and
training, which vary by country:
    * Unskilled and semi-skilled â General site labor with little or no
      construction qualifications.
    * Skilled â Tradesmen who've served apprenticeships, typically in labor
      unions, and on-site managers who possess extensive knowledge and
      experience in their craft or profession.
    * Technical and management â Personnel with the greatest educational
      qualifications, usually graduate_degrees, trained to design, manage and
      instruct the construction process.
Skilled occupations include carpenters, electricians, plumbers, ironworkers,
masons, and many other manual crafts, as well as those involved in project
management. In the UK these require further_education qualifications, often in
vocational subject areas. These qualifications are either obtained directly
after the completion of compulsory_education or through "on the job"
apprenticeship_training.[25] In the UK, 8500 construction-related
apprenticeships were commenced in 2007.[26]
Technical and specialized occupations require more training as a greater
technical knowledge is required. These professions also hold more legal
responsibility. A short list of the main careers with an outline of the
educational requirements are given below:
    * Architect â Typically holds 1, undergraduate 3-year degree in
      architecture + 1, post-graduate 2-year degree (DipArch or BArch) in
      architecture plus 24 months' experience within the industry. To use the
      title "architect" the individual must be registered on the Architects
      Registration_Board register of Architects.
    * Civil_engineer â Typically holds a degree in a related subject. The
      Chartered_Engineer qualification is controlled by the Engineering
      Council, and is often achieved through membership of the Institution_of
      Civil_Engineers. A new university graduate must hold a master's_degree to
      become chartered; persons with bachelor's_degrees may become an
      Incorporated_Engineer.
    * Building_services_engineer â Often referred to as an "M&E Engineer"
      typically holds a degree in mechanical or electrical engineering.
      Chartered Engineer status is governed by the Engineering_Council, mainly
      through the Chartered_Institution_of_Building_Services_Engineers.
    * Project_manager â Typically holds a 4-year or greater higher_education
      qualification, but are often also qualified in another field such as
      architecture, civil engineering or quantity surveying.
    * Structural_engineer â Typically holds a bachelor's or master's degree
      in structural engineering. A P.ENG is required from the Professional
      Engineers Ontario (Canada). New university graduates must hold a master's
      degree to gain chartered status from the Engineering_Council, mainly
      through the Institution_of_Structural_Engineers (UK).
    * Quantity_surveyor â Typically holds a bachelor's degree in quantity
      surveying. Chartered status is gained from the Royal_Institution_of
      Chartered_Surveyors.
    * Civil_estimators are professionals who typically have a background in
      civil engineering, construction_project_management, or construction
      supervision.
In 2010 a salary survey revealed the differences in remuneration between
different roles, sectors and locations in the construction and built
environment industry.[27] The results showed that areas of particularly strong
growth in the construction industry, such as the Middle_East, yield higher
average salaries than in the UK, for example. The average earning for a
professional in the construction industry in the Middle East, across all
sectors, job types and levels of experience, is Â£42,090, compared to Â£26,719
in the UK.[28] This trend is not necessarily due to the fact that more affluent
roles are available; however, as architects with 14 or more years' experience
working in the Middle East earn on average Â£43,389 per annum, compared to
Â£40,000 in the UK.[28] Some construction_workers in the US/Canada have made
more than $100,000 annually, depending on their trade.[29]
***** Safety[edit] *****

At-risk workers without appropriate safety equipment
Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring
more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States
and in the European_Union.[30][31] In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate
among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for
all workers, with Falls being one of the most common causes of fatal and non-
fatal injuries among construction workers.[30] Proper safety equipment such as
harnesses, hard hats and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and
inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the
construction industry.[32] Other major causes of fatalities in the construction
industry include electrocution, transportation accidents, and trench cave-ins.
[33]
Roofing requires a very high level of safety
Other safety risks for workers in construction include hearing_loss due to high
noise exposure, musculoskeletal_injury, chemical exposure, and high levels of
stress.[24] Besides that, the high turnover of workers in construction industry
imposes a huge challenge of accomplishing the restructuring of work practices
in individual workplaces or with individual workers.[citation_needed]
Construction has been identified by the National_Institute_for_Occupational
Safety_and_Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National
Occupational_Research_Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention
strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues.[34][35]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_construction
See also: History_of_architecture
The first huts and shelters were constructed by hand or with simple tools. As
cities grew during the Bronze_Age, a class of professional craftsmen, like
bricklayers and carpenters, appeared. Occasionally, slaves were used for
construction work. In the Middle_Ages, the artisan craftsmen were organized
into guilds. In the 19th century, steam-powered machinery appeared, and, later,
diesel- and electric-powered vehicles such as cranes, excavators and
bulldozers.
Fast-track_construction has been increasingly popular in the 21st century. Some
estimates suggest that 40% of construction projects are now fast-track
construction.[36]
