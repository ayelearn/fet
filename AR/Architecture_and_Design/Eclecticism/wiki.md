Eclecticism in architecture at the intersection of RÃ¡kÃ³czi_Avenue and the
Grand_Boulevard in Budapest
Eclecticism is a conceptual approach that does not hold rigidly to a single
paradigm or set of assumptions, but instead draws upon multiple theories,
styles, or ideas to gain complementary insights into a subject, or applies
different theories in particular cases. However, this is often without
conventions or rules dictating how or which theories were combined.
It can sometimes seem inelegant or lacking in simplicity, and eclectics are
sometimes criticized for lack of consistency in their thinking. It is, however,
common in many fields of study. For example, most psychologists accept certain
aspects of behaviorism, but do not attempt to use the theory to explain all
aspects of human behavior.
Eclecticism in ethics, philosophy, and religion is also known as syncretism.

***** Origin[edit] *****
Eclecticism was first recorded to have been practiced by a group of ancient
Greek and Roman philosophers who attached themselves to no real system, but
selected from existing philosophical beliefs those doctrines that seemed most
reasonable to them. Out of this collected material they constructed their new
system of philosophy. The term comes from the Greek á¼ÎºÎ»ÎµÎºÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ
(eklektikos), literally "choosing the best",[1][2] and that from
á¼ÎºÎ»ÎµÎºÏÏÏ (eklektos), "picked out, select".[3] Well known eclectics in
Greek_philosophy were the Stoics Panaetius and Posidonius, and the New
Academics Carneades and Philo_of_Larissa. Among the Romans, Cicero was
thoroughly eclectic, as he united the Peripatetic, Stoic, and New Academic
doctrines. Philo's successor and Cicero's teacher Antiochus_of_Ascalon is
credited with influencing the Academy so that it finally transitioned from
Scepticism to Eclecticism.[4] Other eclectics included Varro and Seneca_the
Younger.
According to RoÅ¡ker and Suhadolnik, however, even though eclecticism had a
Greek origin, the term was rarely used and it was even given a negative
connotation by historians of Greek thought, associating it with the description
for impure and unoriginal thinking.[5] Scholars such as Clement_of_Alexandria
maintained that eclecticism had a long history in Greek philosophy and it is
underpinned by a deeper metaphysical and theological conviction concerning the
absolute/God as the source of all noble thoughts and that all parts of the
truth can be found among the various philosophical systems.[6]
***** Architecture and art[edit] *****
New_York_Palace, Budapest, Hungary
The term eclecticism is used to describe the combination, in a single work, of
elements from different historical styles, chiefly in architecture and, by
implication, in the fine and decorative arts. The term is sometimes also
loosely applied to the general stylistic variety of 19th-century architecture
after neoclassicism (c. 1820), although the revivals of styles in that period
have, since the 1970s, generally been referred to as aspects of historicism.[7]
Eclecticism plays an important role in critical discussions and evaluations but
is somehow distant from the actual forms of the artifacts to which it is
applied, and its meaning is thus rather indistinct. The simplest definition of
the termâthat every work of art represents the combination of a variety of
influencesâis so basic as to be of little use. In some ways Eclecticism is
reminiscent of Mannerism in that the term was used pejoratively for much of the
period of its currency, although, unlike Mannerism, Eclecticism never amounted
to a movement or constituted a specific style: it is characterized precisely by
the fact that it was not a particular style.

***** Martial arts[edit] *****
See also: Hybrid_martial_arts
Some martial_arts can be described as eclectic in the sense that they borrow
techniques from a wide variety of other martial arts.
***** Philology[edit] *****
In textual_criticism, eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of
text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the
process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic
approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms
opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal
evidence.
Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no a priori bias to
a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of
the New_Testament (currently, the United_Bible_Society, 4th ed. and Nestle-
Ãland, 27th ed.). Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the Alexandrian
text-type, are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian
disposition.[8]
***** Philosophy[edit] *****
In ancient_philosophy, the Eclectics use elements from multiple philosophies,
texts, life experiences and their own philosophical ideas. These ideas include
life as connected with existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and
language. Antiochus_of_Ascalon (c. 125 â c. 69 BC), was the pupil of Philo_of
Larissa, and the teacher of Cicero. Through his influence, Platonism made the
transition from New_Academy skepticism to Eclecticism.[9]:273 Whereas Philo had
still adhered to the doctrine that there is nothing absolutely certain,
Antiochus returned to a pronounced dogmatism. Among his other objections to
skepticism was the consideration that without firm convictions no rational
content of life is possible.[9]:273 Antiochus pointed out that it is a
contradiction to assert that nothing can be asserted or to prove that nothing
can be proved; that we cannot speak of false ideas and at the same time deny
the distinction between false and true.[9]:274 He expounded the Academic,
Peripatetic, and Stoic systems in such a way as to show that these three
schools deviate from one another only in minor points.[9]:274 Antiochus himself
was chiefly interested in ethics, in which he tried to find a middle way
between Zeno, Aristotle, and Plato. For instance, he said that virtue suffices
for happiness, but for the highest grade of happiness bodily and external goods
are necessary as well.[9]:274
This eclectic tendency was favoured by the lack of dogmatic works by Plato.[9]:
305 Middle Platonism was promoted by the necessity of considering the main
theories of the post-Platonic schools of philosophy, such as the Aristotelian
logic and the Stoic psychology and ethics (theory of goods and emotions).[9]:
306 On the one hand the Middle Platonists were engaged like the later
Peripatetics in scholarly activities such as the exposition of Plato's
doctrines and the explanation of his dialogues; on the other hand they
attempted to develop the Platonic theories systematically. In so far as it was
subject in this to the influence of Neopythagoreanism, it was of considerable
importance in preparing the way for Neoplatonism.[9]:306
In modern_philosophy, Victor_Cousin was the founder of eclectic spiritualism.

Eclecticism is recognized in approaches to psychology that see many factors
influencing behavior and cognition or psyche. In the 1970s, psychologists
started using whichever approaches and techniques that they deemed appropriate
for their client.[11] They take multiple perspectives into consideration while
identifying, explaining, and changing the behavior of the client.[11]
