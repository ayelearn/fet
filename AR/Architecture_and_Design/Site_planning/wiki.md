Site planning in landscape_architecture and architecture refers to the
organizational stage of the landscape design process. It involves the
organization of land use zoning, access, circulation, privacy, security,
shelter, land drainage, and other factors. This is done by arranging the
compositional elements of landform, planting, water, buildings and paving in
site_plans.[1] Site planning is the design and process of planning for a new
development project. Within Community_Development, this stage of site planning
is the organizing phase where city planners create a tactical/detailed plan of
new developments. These site plans are the exact details city planners need to
give their proposal to the community.[1] This is the proposal to the community
to get development plans approved of. Through site analysis and precise
dimensions taken by development engineers, community members are given an exact
image of what developers want to do.
***** Factors[edit] *****
Site planning generally begins by assessing a potential site for development
through site_analysis. Information about slope, soils, hydrology, vegetation,
parcel ownership, orientation, etc. are assessed and mapped. By determining
areas that are poor for development (such as floodplain or steep slopes) and
better for development, the planner or architect can assess optimal location
and design a structure that works within this space. Within site analysis you
also need to take into consideration the structure of zoning throughout a city.
[1] These are regulations that have been structured to separate the land of
what can be used as residential and industrial. This allows a city to not be
over powered by one type of land distinction.
When creating a development project plan city planners take into consideration
and look at other buildings site plans to see what characteristics it has that
helped get their building or renovation approved. City planners must look at
different aspects that may affect the citizens around them because they are the
ones living next to this. City planners must take into consideration height of
a building, walking space, parking for cars/bikes and does it stand out from
the cities other building types, design wise.[1] These are all things that have
to be considered because citizens are not going to want buildings blocking
certain views/sunlight, customers/ new residents taking up parking current
residents parking and having a building style that looks out of place and like
it doesn't belong because city planners wanted a new/modern style building.
Within the it plan there also is details about where everything currently is,
not only buildings but water, sewer and power lines.[1] These are necessities
that need to be kept safe and taken into consideration when developing a new
development project. Within creating new development plans there are
regulations that all buildings have to follow that are created by the city.
These are regulations to help keep new development projects going out of
control and keeping our city contained and not expanding at alarming rates that
we cannot control.
***** History[edit] *****
Site Planning was created by city planners to develop a clear plan/ design of
what the city planners want for our community.[2] To start off, community
members would make claims of buildings that need renovations and improvements
to their community. Then the community developers want to come up with a way to
satisfy their community members and this is done by creating a site plan.
Planners have discovered that they have to be smart about with there designs
because they have to remember they have a certain budget.[2] All these actions
of creating this design is called site planning.
