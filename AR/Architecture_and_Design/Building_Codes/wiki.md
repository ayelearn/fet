Code Violation: This fire-rated concrete_block wall is penetrated by cable
trays and electrical_cables. The hole should be firestopped to restore the
fire-resistance_rating of the wall. Instead, it is filled with flammable
polyurethane_foam.
A building code (also building control or building regulations) is a set of
rules that specify the standards for constructed objects such as buildings and
nonbuilding_structures. Buildings must conform to the code to obtain planning
permission, usually from a local council. The main purpose of building codes is
to protect public_health, safety and general welfare as they relate to the
construction and occupancy of buildings and structures. The building code
becomes law of a particular jurisdiction when formally enacted by the
appropriate governmental or private authority.[1]
Building codes are generally intended to be applied by architects, engineers,
interior_designers, constructors and regulators but are also used for various
purposes by safety_inspectors, environmental_scientists, real_estate
developers, subcontractors, manufacturers of building products and materials,
insurance companies, facility managers, tenants, and others. Codes regulate the
design and construction of structures where adopted into law.
Examples of building codes began in ancient times.[2] In the USA the main codes
are the International_Commercial_or_Residential_Code_[ICC/IRC], electrical
codes and plumbing, mechanical codes. Fifty states and the District of Columbia
have adopted the I-Codes at the state or jurisdictional level.[3] In Canada,
national model codes are published by the National_Research_Council_of_Canada.

"Sutyagin's_skyscraper" (ÐÐµÐ±Ð¾ÑÐºÑÑÐ±_Ð¡ÑÑÑÐ³Ð¸Ð½Ð°) â supposedly
world's tallest wooden single-family house â found to be in violation of fire
codes by the city of Arkhangelsk, Russia, and was demolished. [1][5][6]
The practice of developing, approving, and enforcing building codes varies
considerably among nations. In some countries building codes are developed by
the government agencies or quasi-governmental standards_organizations and then
enforced across the country by the central_government. Such codes are known as
the national building codes (in a sense they enjoy a mandatory nationwide
application).
In other countries, where the power of regulating construction and fire safety
is vested in local_authorities, a system of model_building_codes is used. Model
building codes have no legal status unless adopted or adapted by an authority
having jurisdiction. The developers of model codes urge public authorities to
reference model codes in their laws, ordinances, regulations, and
administrative orders. When referenced in any of these legal instruments, a
particular model code becomes law. This practice is known as adoption by
reference. When an adopting authority decides to delete, add, or revise any
portions of the model_code adopted, it is usually required by the model_code
developer to follow a formal adoption procedure in which those modifications
can be documented for legal purposes.
There are instances when some local_jurisdictions choose to develop their own
building codes. At some point in time all major cities in the United_States had
their own building codes. However, due to ever increasing complexity and cost
of developing building regulations, virtually all municipalities in the country
have chosen to adopt model_codes instead. For example, in 2008 New York City
abandoned its proprietary 1968 New York City Building Code in favor of a
customized version of the International_Building_Code.[7] The City of Chicago
remains the only municipality in America that continues to use a building code
the city developed on its own as part of the Municipal_Code_of_Chicago.
In Europe, the Eurocode is a pan-European building code that has superseded the
older national building codes. Each country now has National Annexes to
localize the contents of the Eurocode.
Similarly, in India, each municipality and urban development authority has its
own building code, which is mandatory for all construction within their
jurisdiction. All these local building codes are variants of a National
Building_Code, which serves as model code proving guidelines for regulating
building construction activity.
***** History[edit] *****
**** Antiquity[edit] ****
Building codes have a long history. The earliest known written building code is
included in the Code_of_Hammurabi,[2] which dates from circa 1772 BC.
The book of Deuteronomy in the Hebrew_Bible stipulated that parapets must be
constructed on all houses to prevent people from falling off.[8]
**** Modern era[edit] ****
After the Great_Fire_of_London in 1666, which had been able to spread so
rapidly through the densely built timber housing of the city, the Rebuilding_of
London_Act was passed in the same year as the first significant building
regulation.[9] Drawn up by Sir_Matthew_Hale, the Act regulated the rebuilding
of the city, required housing to have some fire resistance capacity and
authorised the City_of_London_Corporation to reopen and widen roads.[10] The
Laws_of_the_Indies were passed in the 1680s by the Spanish_Crown to regulate
the urban planning for colonies throughout Spain's worldwide imperial
possessions.
The first systematic national building standard was established with the London
Building Act of 1844. Among the provisions, builders were required to give the
district surveyor two days' notice before building, regulations regarding the
thickness of walls, height of rooms, the materials used in repairs, the
dividing of existing buildings and the placing and design of chimneys,
fireplaces and drains were to be enforced and streets had to be built to
minimum requirements.[11]
The Metropolitan_Buildings_Office was formed to regulate the construction and
use of buildings throughout London. Surveyors were empowered to enforce
building regulations, which sought to improve the standard of houses and
business premises, and to regulate activities that might threaten public
health. In 1855 the assets, powers and responsibilities of the office passed to
the Metropolitan_Board_of_Works.
The City of Baltimore passed its first building code in 1859. The Great
Baltimore_Fire occurred in February, 1904. Subsequent changes were made that
matched other cities.[12] In 1904, a Handbook of the Baltimore City Building
Laws was published. It served as the building code for four years. Very soon, a
formal building code was drafted and eventually adopted in 1908.
In Paris, under the reconstruction of much of the city under the Second_Empire_
(1852â70), great blocks of apartments were erected[13] and the height of
buildings was limited by law to five or six stories at most.
The structural failure of the tank that caused the Great_Molasses_Flood of 1919
prompted the Boston Building Department to require engineering and
architectural calculations be filed and signed. U.S. cities and states soon
began requiring sign-off by registered professional engineers for the plans of
major buildings.[14]

The purpose of building codes is to provide minimum standards for safety,
health, and general welfare including structural integrity, mechanical
integrity (including sanitation, water supply, light, and ventilation), means
of egress, fire prevention and control, and energy conservation.[15][16]
Building codes generally include:
    * Standards for structure, placement, size, usage, wall assemblies,
      fenestration size/locations, egress rules, size/location of rooms,
      foundations, floor assemblies, roof structures/assemblies, energy
      efficiency, stairs and halls, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, site
      drainage & storage, appliance, lighting, fixtures standards, occupancy
      rules, and swimming pool regulations.
    * Rules regarding parking and traffic impact
    * Fire_code rules to minimize the risk of a fire and to ensure safe
      evacuation in the event of such an emergency[citation_needed]
    * Requirements for earthquake (seismic_code), hurricane, flood, and tsunami
      resistance, especially in disaster prone areas or for very large
      buildings where a failure would be catastrophic[citation_needed]
    * Requirements for specific building uses (for example, storage of
      flammable substances, or housing a large number of people)
    * Energy provisions and consumption
    * Grandfather_clauses: Unless the building is being renovated, the building
      code usually does not apply to existing buildings.
    * Specifications on components
    * Allowable installation methodologies
    * Minimum and maximum room ceiling heights, exit sizes and location
    * Qualification of individuals or corporations doing the work
    * For high structures, anti-collision markers for the benefit of aircraft
Building codes are generally separate from zoning ordinances, but exterior
restrictions (such as setbacks) may fall into either category.
Designers use building code standards out of substantial reference books during
design. Building departments review plans submitted to them before
construction, issue permits [or not] and inspectors verify compliance to these
standards at the site during construction.
There are often additional codes or sections of the same building code that
have more specific requirements that apply to dwellings or places of business
and special construction objects such as canopies, signs, pedestrian walkways,
parking_lots, and radio and television_antennas.
