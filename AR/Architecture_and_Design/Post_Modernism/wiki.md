Postmodernism is a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late 20th
century across philosophy, the_arts, architecture, and criticism, marking a
departure from modernism. The term has been more generally applied to the
historical_era_following_modernity and the tendencies of this era.
While encompassing a wide variety of approaches and disciplines, postmodernism
is generally defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony, or rejection of the
grand_narratives and ideologies of modernism, often calling into question
various assumptions of Enlightenment_rationality. Consequently, common targets
of postmodern critique include universalist notions of objective_reality,
morality, truth, human_nature, reason, language, and social_progress.
Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the contingent or socially-
conditioned nature of knowledge claims and value_systems, situating them as
products of particular political, historical, or cultural discourses and
hierarchies. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by
tendencies to self-referentiality, epistemological and moral_relativism,
pluralism, and irreverence.
Postmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s, and have
been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines, including
cultural_studies, philosophy_of_science, economics, linguistics, architecture,
feminist_theory, and literary_criticism, as well as art_movements in fields
such as literature, contemporary_art, and music. Postmodernism is often
associated with schools of thought such as deconstruction, post-structuralism,
and institutional_critique, as well as philosophers such as Jean-FranÃ§ois
Lyotard, Jacques_Derrida, and Fredric_Jameson.
Criticisms_of_postmodernism are intellectually diverse, and include assertions
that postmodernism promotes obscurantism, and is meaningless, adding nothing to
analytical or empirical knowledge.

***** Introduction[edit] *****
Postmodernism is an intellectual stance[1] or a mode of discourse[2][3] that
rejects the possibility of reliable knowledge,[4][5] denies the existence of a
universal, stable reality,[6][7][8][9] and frames aesthetics and beauty as
arbitrary and subjective.[10][11] It can be described as a reaction against
scientific attempts to explain reality with objective certainty, recognizing
that reality is constructed as the mind tries to understand its own personal
circumstances.[12] It is characterized by an attitude of skepticism, irony, or
rejection toward the grand_narratives and ideologies of modernism, often
denying or challenging the validity of scientific inquiry,[13] or declaiming
the arbitrariness of the aesthetics of artistic works or other artifacts of
cultural production,[14] or questioning various assumptions of Enlightenment
rationality.[15] Initially, postmodernism was a mode of discourse on literature
and literary criticism, commenting on the nature of literary text, meaning,
author and reader, writing and reading.[16] Postmodernism developed in the mid-
to late 20th century across philosophy, the_arts, architecture, and criticism
as a departure or rejection of modernism.[17][7][18][17]
Postmodernism relies on critical_theory, an approach that confronts the
ideological, social, and historical structures that shape and constrain
cultural production.[19] Common targets of postmodernism and critical theory
include universalist notions of objective_reality, morality, truth, human
nature, reason, language, and social_progress.[15] Postmodernist approaches
have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines,
including political_science,[20] organization_theory,[21] cultural_studies,
philosophy_of_science, economics, linguistics, architecture, feminist_theory,
and literary_criticism, as well as art_movements in fields such as literature
and music.
Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the contingent or socially-
conditioned nature of knowledge claims and value_systems, situating them as
products of particular political, historical, or cultural discourses and
hierarchies. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by
tendencies to self-referentiality, epistemological and moral_relativism,
pluralism, and irreverence. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of
thought such as deconstruction and post-structuralism, as well as philosophers
such as Jean-FranÃ§ois_Lyotard, Jacques_Derrida, and Fredric_Jameson.
Criticisms_of_postmodernism are intellectually diverse, and include assertions
that postmodernism promotes obscurantism, and is meaningless, adding nothing to
analytical or empirical knowledge.[22][23][24][25] Some philosophers, beginning
with the pragmatist philosopher JÃ¼rgen_Habermas, assert that those who employ
postmodernist discourse are prey to a performative contradiction and a paradox
of self-reference, as their critique would be impossible without the concepts
and methods that modern reason provides.[26] Conservatives Michael_Oakeshott
and Leo_Strauss considered postmodernism to be an abandonment of the
rationalist project which many conservatives consider the most important
cultural product of humans and Leo_Strauss sought to restore rationalism to a
more skeptical Aristotelian version "embedded in the ordinary reality that
humans perceived".[27] Others have claimed that persons who are knowledgeable
about postmodernism have difficulty distinguishing nonsensical postmodernist
artifacts from those that are nominally genuine.[28][29][30]

The term postmodern was first used around the 1870s.[31] John Watkins Chapman
suggested "a Postmodern style of painting" as a way to depart from French
Impressionism.[32] J. M. Thompson, in his 1914 article in The_Hibbert_Journal
(a quarterly philosophical review), used it to describe changes in attitudes
and beliefs in the critique of religion, writing: "The raison d'Ãªtre of Post-
Modernism is to escape from the double-mindedness of Modernism by being
thorough in its criticism by extending it to religion as well as theology, to
Catholic feeling as well as to Catholic tradition."[33]
In 1942 H. R. Hays described postmodernism as a new literary form.[citation
needed]
In 1926, Bernard_Iddings_Bell, president of St. Stephen's College (now Bard
College), published Postmodernism and Other Essays, marking the first use of
the term to describe the historical period following Modernity.[34][35] In it,
he criticizes the lingering socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices of
the Age_of_Enlightenment; forecasts the major cultural shifts toward
Postmodernity, and (being an Anglo-Catholic priest) offers orthodox religion as
a solution.[36] However, as a general theory for a historical movement, it was
first used in 1939 by Arnold_J._Toynbee: "Our own Post-Modern Age has been
inaugurated by the general war of 1914â1918".[37]
Portland_Building (1982), by architect Michael Graves, an example of Postmodern
architecture
In 1949 the term was used to describe a dissatisfaction with modern
architecture, and led to the postmodern_architecture movement,[38] and a
response to the modernist architectural movement known as the International
Style. Postmodernism in architecture was initially marked by a re-emergence of
surface ornament, reference to surrounding buildings in urban settings,
historical reference in decorative forms (eclecticism), and non-orthogonal
angles.[39]
Peter_Drucker suggested the transformation into a post-modern world happened
between 1937 and 1957 (when he was writing). He described an as yet "nameless
era" which he characterized as a shift to conceptual world based on pattern,
purpose, and process rather than mechanical cause, outlined by four new
realities: the emergence of Educated Society, the importance of international
development, the decline of the nation state, and the collapse of the viability
of non-Western cultures.[40]
In 1971, in a lecture delivered at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London,
Mel_Bochner described "post-modernism" in art as having started with Jasper
Johns, "who first rejected sense-data and the singular point-of-view as the
basis for his art, and treated art as a critical investigation".[41]
In 1996, Walter_Truett_Anderson described postmodernism as belonging to one of
four typological world views, which he identifies as either (a) Postmodern-
ironist, which sees truth as socially constructed, (b) Scientific-rational, in
which truth is found through methodical, disciplined inquiry, (c) Social-
traditional, in which truth is found in the heritage of American and Western
civilization, or (d) Neo-Romantic, in which truth is found through attaining
harmony with nature and/or spiritual exploration of the inner self.[42]
***** History[edit] *****
The basic features of what is now called postmodernism can be found as early as
the 1940s, most notably in the work of artists such as Jorge_Luis_Borges.[43]
However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete
with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.
[44] Since then, postmodernism has been a powerful, though not undisputed,
force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and
continental_philosophy.[citation_needed]
Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic
play with styles, citations and narrative levels,[45] a metaphysical skepticism
or nihilism towards a "grand_narrative" of Western culture,[46] a preference
for the virtual at the expense of the_Real (or more accurately, a fundamental
questioning of what 'the real' constitutes).[47]
Since the late 1990s there has been a growing feeling both in popular culture
and in academia that postmodernism "has gone out of fashion".[48] Arguing from
the context of current cultural production, others contend that postmodernism
is dead.[49][50][51]
***** Theories and derivatives[edit] *****
Postmodernism variously employs, references, or gives rise to structuralism,
post-structuralism, deconstruction, and post-postmodernism.

Structuralism was a philosophical movement developed by French academics in the
1950s, partly in response to French Existentialism,[52] and often interpreted
in relation to Modernism and High_modernism. Thinkers who have been called
structuralists include the anthropologist Claude_LÃ©vi-Strauss, the linguist
Ferdinand_de_Saussure, the Marxist philosopher Louis_Althusser, and the
semiotician Algirdas_Greimas. The early writings of the psychoanalyst Jacques
Lacan and the literary theorist Roland_Barthes have also been called
structuralists. Those who began as structuralists but became post-
structuralists include Michel_Foucault, Roland_Barthes, Jean_Baudrillard,
Gilles_Deleuze. Other post-structuralists include Jacques_Derrida, Pierre
Bourdieu, Jean-FranÃ§ois_Lyotard, Julia_Kristeva, HÃ©lÃ¨ne_Cixous, and Luce
Irigaray. The American cultural theorists, critics and intellectuals whom they
influenced include Judith_Butler, John_Fiske, Rosalind_Krauss, Avital_Ronell,
and Hayden_White.
Like structuralists, post-structuralists start from the assumption that
people's identities, values and economic conditions determine each other rather
than having intrinsic properties that can be understood in isolation.[53] Thus
the French structuralists considered themselves to be espousing Relativism and
Constructionism. But they nevertheless tended to explore how the subjects of
their study might be described, reductively, as a set of essential
relationships, schematics, or mathematical symbols. (An example is Claude
LÃ©vi-Strauss's algebraic formulation of mythological transformation in "The
Structural Study of Myth"[54]).
Postmodernist ideas in philosophy and the analysis of culture and society
expanded the importance of critical_theory and has been the point of departure
for works of literature, architecture and design, as well as being visible in
marketing/business and the interpretation of history, law and culture, starting
in the late 20th century. These developmentsâre-evaluation of the entire
Western value system (love, marriage, popular_culture, shift from industrial to
service_economy) that took place since the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in the
Social_Revolution_of_1968âare described with the term "postmodernity",[55] as
opposed to Postmodernism, a term referring to an opinion or movement.[56] Post-
structuralism is characterized by new ways of thinking through structuralism,
contrary to the original form.[57]

One of the most well-known postmodernist concerns is "deconstruction," a theory
for philosophy, literary criticism, and textual analysis developed by Jacques
Derrida.[58] Critics have insisted that Derrida's work is rooted in a statement
found in Of Grammatology: "Il n'y a pas de hors-texte" (there is no Outside-
text). Such critics misinterpret the statement as denying any reality outside
of books. The statement is actually part of a critique of "inside" and
"outside" metaphors when referring to text, and is corollary to the observation
that there is no "inside" of a text as well.[59] This attention to a text's
unacknowledged reliance on metaphors and figures embedded within its discourse
is characteristic of Derrida's approach. Derrida's method sometimes involves
demonstrating that a given philosophical discourse depends on binary
oppositions and/or excluded terms that the discourse itself has declared to be
irrelevant or inapplicable. Derrida's philosophy inspired a postmodern movement
called deconstructivism among architects, characterized by design that rejects
structural "centers" and encourages decentralized play among its elements.
Derrida discontinued his involvement with the movement after the publication of
his collaborative project with architect Peter Eisenman in Chora L Works:
Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman.[60]

The connection between postmodernism, posthumanism, and cyborgism has led to a
challenge to postmodernism, for which the terms "postpostmodernism" and
"postpoststructuralism" were first coined in 2003:[61][62]
     In some sense, we may regard postmodernism, posthumanism,
     poststructuralism, etc., as being of the 'cyborg age' of mind over
     body. Deconference was an exploration in post-cyborgism (i.e. what
     comes after the postcorporeal era), and thus explored issues of
     postpostmodernism, postpoststructuralism, and the like. To understand
     this transition from 'pomo' (cyborgism) to 'popo' (postcyborgism) we
     must first understand the cyborg era itself.[63]
More recently metamodernism, post-postmodernism and the "death of
postmodernism" have been widely debated: in 2007 Andrew Hoberek noted in his
introduction to a special issue of the journal Twentieth Century Literature
titled "After Postmodernism" that "declarations of postmodernism's demise have
become a critical commonplace". A small group of critics has put forth a range
of theories that aim to describe culture or society in the alleged aftermath of
postmodernism, most notably Raoul Eshelman (performatism), Gilles_Lipovetsky
(hypermodernity), Nicolas_Bourriaud (altermodern), and Alan Kirby
(digimodernism, formerly called pseudo-modernism). None of these new theories
and labels have so far gained very widespread acceptance. Sociocultural
anthropologist Nina MÃ¼ller-Schwarze offers neostructuralism as a possible
direction.[64] The exhibition Postmodernism â Style and Subversion
1970â1990 at the Victoria_and_Albert_Museum (London, 24 September 2011 â 15
January 2012) was billed as the first show to document postmodernism as a
historical movement.

In the 1970s a group of poststructuralists in France developed a radical
critique of modern philosophy with roots discernible in Nietzche, Kierkegaard,
and Heidegger, and became known as postmodern theorists, notably including
Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, and
others. New and challenging modes of thought and writing pushed the development
of new areas and topics in philosophy. By the 1980s, this spread to America
(Richard Rorty) and the world.[65]
**** Jacques Derrida[edit] ****
Main article: Jacques_Derrida
Jacques Derrida was a French philosopher best known for developing a form of
semiotic analysis known as deconstruction, which he discussed in numerous
texts, and developed in the context of phenomenology.[66][67][68] He is one of
the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern_philosophy.
[69][not_specific_enough_to_verify][70][not_specific_enough_to_verify][71]
Derrida re-examined the fundamentals of writing and its consequences on
philosophy in general; sought to undermine the language of "presence" or
metaphysics in an analytical technique which, beginning as a point of departure
from Heidegger's notion of Destruktion, came to be known as Deconstruction.
[citation_needed]
**** Michel Foucault[edit] ****
Main article: Michel_Foucault
Michel Foucault was a French_philosopher, historian_of_ideas, social_theorist,
and literary_critic. First associated with structuralism, Foucault created an
oeuvre which today is seen as belonging to post-structuralism, and to
postmodern philosophy. Leading light of French_theory [fr], his work remains
relatively fruitful in the English-speaking academic world, above and beyond
the sub-disciplines involved. The Times_Higher_Education Guide described him in
2009 as the most cited author in the humanities.[72]
Michel Foucault introduced concepts such as 'discursive_regime', or re-invoked
those of older philosophers like 'episteme' and 'genealogy' in order to explain
the relationship between meaning, power, and social behavior within social
orders (see The_Order_of_Things, The_Archaeology_of_Knowledge, Discipline_and
Punish, and The_History_of_Sexuality).[citation_needed]
**** Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard[edit] ****
Main article: Jean-FranÃ§ois_Lyotard
Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard is credited with being the first to use the term in a
philosophical context, in his 1979 work The_Postmodern_Condition:_A_Report_on
Knowledge. In it, he follows Wittgenstein's language_games model and speech_act
theory, contrasting two different language games, that of the expert, and that
of the philosopher, and talks about transformation of knowledge into
information in the computer age, and likens the transmission or reception of
coded messages (information) to a position within a language game.[73]
Lyotard defined philosophical postmodernism in The Postmodern Condition,
writing: "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity
towards meta narratives...." [74] where what he means by metanarrative is
something like a unified, complete, universal, and epistemically_certain story
about everything that is. Postmodernists reject metanarratives because they
reject the concept of truth that metanarratives presuppose. Postmodernist
philosophers in general argue that truth is always contingent on historical and
social context rather than being absolute and universal and that truth is
always partial and "at issue" rather than being complete and certain.[73]
**** Richard Rorty[edit] ****
Main article: Richard_Rorty
Richard Rorty argues in Philosophy_and_the_Mirror_of_Nature that contemporary
analytic_philosophy mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he
denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of representationalism
and correspondence_theory that rely upon the independence of knowers and
observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to
consciousness.
**** Jean Baudrillard[edit] ****
Main article: Jean_Baudrillard
Jean Baudrillard, in Simulacra_and_Simulation, introduced the concept that
reality or the principle of "The_Real" is short-circuited by the
interchangeability of signs in an era whose communicative and semantic acts are
dominated by electronic media and digital technologies. Baudrillard proposes
the notion that, in such a state, where subjects are detached from the outcomes
of events (political, literary, artistic, personal, or otherwise), events no
longer hold any particular sway on the subject nor have any identifiable
context; they therefore have the effect of producing widespread indifference,
detachment, and passivity in industrialized populations. He claimed that a
constant stream of appearances and references without any direct consequences
to viewers or readers could eventually render the division between appearance
and object indiscernible, resulting, ironically, in the "disappearance" of
mankind in what is, in effect, a virtual or holographic state, composed only of
appearances. For Baudrillard, "simulation is no longer that of a territory, a
referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real
without origin or a reality: a hyperreal."[75]
**** Fredric Jameson[edit] ****
Main article: Fredric_Jameson
Fredric Jameson set forth one of the first expansive theoretical treatments of
postmodernism as a historical period, intellectual trend, and social phenomenon
in a series of lectures at the Whitney_Museum, later expanded as Postmodernism,
or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1991).[76]
**** Douglas Kellner[edit] ****
Main article: Douglas_Kellner
In Analysis of the Journey, a journal birthed from postmodernism, Douglas
Kellner insists that the "assumptions and procedures of modern theory" must be
forgotten. Extensively, Kellner analyzes the terms of this theory in real-life
experiences and examples.[citation_needed] Kellner used science and technology
studies as a major part of his analysis; he urged that the theory is incomplete
without it. The scale was larger than just postmodernism alone; it must be
interpreted through cultural studies where science and technology studies play
a huge role. The reality of the September_11_attacks on the United States of
America is the catalyst for his explanation. This catalyst is used as a great
representation due to the mere fact of the planned ambush and destruction of
"symbols of globalization", insinuating the World_Trade_Center.[citation
needed]
One of the numerous yet appropriate definitions of postmodernism and the qualm
aspect aids this attribute to seem perfectly accurate.[clarification_needed] In
response, Kellner continues to examine the repercussions of understanding the
effects of the September 11 attacks. He questions if the attacks are only able
to be understood in a limited form of postmodern theory due to the level of
irony.[77]
The conclusion he depicts is simple: postmodernism, as most use it today, will
decide what experiences and signs in one's reality will be one's reality as
they know it.[78]
***** Manifestations[edit] *****
**** Architecture[edit] ****
Main article: Postmodern_architecture
Neue_Staatsgalerie (1977-84), Stuttgart, Germany, by James Stirling and Michael
Wilford, showing the eclectic mix of classical architecture and colourful
ironic detailing.
The idea of Postmodernism in architecture began as a response to the perceived
blandness and failed Utopianism of the Modern movement.[79] Modern
Architecture, as established and developed by Walter_Gropius and Le_Corbusier,
was focused on the pursuit of a perceived ideal perfection, and attempted
harmony of form and function,[80] and dismissal of "frivolous ornament,"[81]
[82] as well as arguing for an architecture that represented the spirit of the
age as depicted in cutting-edge technology, be it airplanes, cars, ocean liners
or even supposedly artless grain silos.[83] Critics of modernism argued that
the attributes of perfection and minimalism themselves were subjective, and
pointed out anachronisms in modern thought and questioned the benefits of its
philosophy.[84] Modernist Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe is associated with the
phrase "less_is_more".
The intellectual scholarship regarding postmodernism and architecture is
closely linked with the writings of critic-turned-architect Charles_Jencks,
beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay "The rise of post-
modern architecture" from 1975.[85] His magnum opus, however, is the book The
Language of Post-Modern Architecture, first published in 1977, and since
running to seven editions.[86] Jencks makes the point that Post-Modernism (like
Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it is not
just a reaction to Modernism but what he terms double coding: "Double Coding:
the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional
building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a
concerned minority, usually other architects."[87] In their book, "Revisiting
Postmodernism", Terry_Farrell and Adam Furman argue that postmodernism brought
a more joyous and sensual experience to the culture, particularly in
architecture.[88]
**** Art[edit] ****
Main article: Postmodern_art
Postmodern art is a body of art movements that sought to contradict some
aspects of modernism or some aspects that emerged or developed in its
aftermath. Cultural production manifesting as intermedia, installation art,
conceptual art, deconstructionist display, and multimedia, particularly
involving video are described as postmodern.[89]
**** Graphic design[edit] ****
April_Greiman
Early mention of postmodernism as an element of graphic design appeared in the
British magazine, "Design".[90] A characteristic of postmodern graphic design
is that "retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all
conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and
advocates".[91]
**** Literature[edit] ****
Orhan_Pamuk, winner of the 2006 Nobel_Prize_in_Literature
Main article: Postmodern_literature
Jorge_Luis_Borges' (1939) short story Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote, is
often considered as predicting postmodernism[92] and conceiving the ideal of
the ultimate parody.[93] Samuel_Beckett is sometimes seen as an important
precursor and influence. Novelists who are commonly connected with postmodern
literature include Vladimir_Nabokov, William_Gaddis, Umberto_Eco, Pier_Vittorio
Tondelli, John_Hawkes, William_S._Burroughs, Giannina_Braschi, Kurt_Vonnegut,
John_Barth, Jean_Rhys, Donald_Barthelme, E._L._Doctorow, Richard_Kalich, Jerzy
KosiÅski, Don_DeLillo, Thomas_Pynchon[94] (Pynchon's work has also been
described as "high_modern"[95]), Ishmael_Reed, Kathy_Acker, Ana_Lydia_Vega,
JÃ¡chym_Topol and Paul_Auster.
In 1971, the Arab-American scholar Ihab_Hassan published The Dismemberment of
Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature, an early work of literary criticism
from a postmodern perspective, in which the author traces the development of
what he calls "literature of silence" through Marquis_de_Sade, Franz_Kafka,
Ernest_Hemingway, Beckett, and many others, including developments such as the
Theatre_of_the_Absurd and the nouveau_roman. In Postmodernist Fiction (1987),
Brian_McHale details the shift from modernism to postmodernism, arguing that
the former is characterized by an epistemological dominant, and that postmodern
works have developed out of modernism and are primarily concerned with
questions of ontology.[96] In Constructing Postmodernism (1992), McHale's
second book, he provides readings of postmodern fiction and of some of the
contemporary writers who go under the label of cyberpunk. McHale's "What Was
Postmodernism?" (2007),[97] follows Raymond_Federman's lead in now using the
past tense when discussing postmodernism.
**** Music[edit] ****
Composer Henryk_GÃ³recki
Main articles: Postmodern_music, Postmodern_classical_music, and Art_pop
Jonathan Kramer has written that avant-garde musical compositions (which some
would consider modernist rather than postmodernist) âdefy more than seduce
the listener, and they extend by potentially unsettling means the very idea of
what music is.â[98] The postmodern impulse in classical music arose in the
1960s with the advent of musical minimalism. Composers such as Terry_Riley,
Henryk_GÃ³recki, Bradley_Joseph, John_Adams, Steve_Reich, Philip_Glass, Michael
Nyman, and Lou_Harrison reacted to the perceived elitism and dissonant sound of
atonal academic modernism by producing music with simple textures and
relatively consonant harmonies, whilst others, most notably John_Cage
challenged the prevailing narratives of beauty and objectivity common to
Modernism.
Author on postmodernism, Dominic Strinati, has noted, it is also important "to
include in this category the so-called 'art_rock' musical innovations and
mixing of styles associated with groups like Talking_Heads, and performers like
Laurie_Anderson, together with the self-conscious 'reinvention of disco' by the
Pet_Shop_Boys".[99]
**** Urban planning[edit] ****
Modernism sought to design and plan cities which followed the logic of the new
model of industrial mass_production; reverting to large-scale solutions,
aesthetic standardisation and prefabricated design solutions.[100] Modernism
eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences and aim towards
homogenous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Jane_Jacobs' 1961 book The_Death_and
Life_of_Great_American_Cities[101] was a sustained critique of urban planning
as it had developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to
postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the
transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:
32pm on 15 July in 1972, when PruittâIgoe; a housing development for low-
income people in St._Louis designed by architect Minoru_Yamasaki, which had
been a prize-winning version of Le_Corbusier's 'machine for modern living' was
deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then,
Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity,
and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007) and
rejects utopianism while embracing a utopian way of thinking and acting.[102]
Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique
of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a
result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or
steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban
planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan'
(Irving 474).[100][103][104][105]
***** Criticisms[edit] *****
Main article: Criticism_of_postmodernism
Criticisms of postmodernism are intellectually diverse, including the
assertions that postmodernism is meaningless and promotes obscurantism.
In part in reference to post-modernism, conservative English philosopher Roger
Scruton wrote, âA writer who says that there are no truths, or that all truth
is âmerely relative,â is asking you not to believe him. So donât.â[106]
Similarly, Dick_Hebdige criticized the vagueness of the term, enumerating a
long list of otherwise unrelated concepts that people have designated as
"postmodernism", from "the dÃ©cor of a room" or "a 'scratch' video", to fear of
nuclear armageddon and the "implosion of meaning", and stated that anything
that could signify all of those things was "a buzzword".[107]
The anarcho-syndicalist linguist and philosopher Noam_Chomsky has argued that
postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical
knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals do not respond like people
in other fields when asked, "what are the principles of their theories, on what
evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious,
etc.?...If [these requests] can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to Hume's
advice in similar circumstances: 'to the flames'."[108]
Christian philosopher William_Lane_Craig has noted "The idea that we live in a
postmodern culture is a myth. In fact, a postmodern culture is an
impossibility; it would be utterly unliveable. People are not relativistic when
it comes to matters of science, engineering, and technology; rather, they are
relativistic and pluralistic in matters of religion and ethics. But, of course,
that's not postmodernism; that's modernism!"[109]
American academic and aesthete Camille_Paglia has asserted "The end result of
four decades of postmodernism permeating the art world is that there is very
little interesting or important work being done right now in the fine arts.
Irony was a bold and creative posture when Duchamp did it, but it is now an
utterly banal, exhausted, and tedious strategy. Young artists have been taught
to be âcoolâ and âhipâ and thus painfully self-conscious. They are not
encouraged to be enthusiastic, emotional, and visionary. They have been cut off
from artistic tradition by the crippled skepticism about history that they have
been taught by ignorant and solipsistic postmodernists. In short, the art world
will never revive until postmodernism fades away. Postmodernism is a plague
upon the mind and the heart."[110]
German philosopher Albrecht_Wellmer has asserted that "postmodernism at its
best might be seen as a self-critical - a sceptical, ironic, but nevertheless
unrelenting - form of modernism; a modernism beyond utopianism, scientism and
foundationalism; in short a postmetaphysical modernism."[111]
A formal, academic critique of postmodernism can be found in Beyond_the_Hoax by
physics professor Alan_Sokal and in Fashionable_Nonsense by Sokal and Belgian
physicist Jean_Bricmont, both books discussing the so-called Sokal_affair. In
1996, Sokal wrote a deliberately nonsensical article in a style similar to
postmodernist articles, which was accepted for publication by the postmodern
cultural studies journal, Social_Text. On the same day of the release he
published another article in a different journal explaining the Social Text
article hoax.[112] The philosopher Thomas_Nagel has supported Sokal and
Bricmont, describing their book Fashionable_Nonsense as consisting largely of
"extensive quotations of scientific gibberish from name-brand French
intellectuals, together with eerily patient explanations of why it is
gibberish,"[113] and agreeing that "there does seem to be something about the
Parisian scene that is particularly hospitable to reckless verbosity."[114]
A more recent example of the difficulty of distinguishing nonsensical artifacts
from genuine postmodernist scholarship is the Grievance_Studies_affair.[115]
The French psychotherapist and philosopher, FÃ©lix_Guattari, often considered a
"postmodernist", rejected its theoretical assumptions by arguing that the
structuralist and postmodernist visions of the world were not flexible enough
to seek explanations in psychological, social and environmental domains at the
same time.[116]
Zimbabwean-born British Marxist Alex_Callinicos argues that postmodernism
"reflects the disappointed revolutionary generation of '68, and the
incorporation of many of its members into the professional and managerial 'new
middle class'. It is best read as a symptom of political frustration and social
mobility rather than as a significant intellectual or cultural phenomenon in
its own right."[117]
Christopher_Hitchens in his book, Why_Orwell_Matters, writes, in advocating for
simple, clear and direct expression of ideas, "The Postmodernists' tyranny
wears people down by boredom and semi-literate prose."[118]
Analytic philosopher Daniel_Dennett declared, "Postmodernism, the school of
'thought' that proclaimed 'There are no truths, only interpretations' has
largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of
academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of
truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for 'conversations' in which
nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style
you can muster."[119]
American historian Richard_Wolin traces the origins of postmodernism to
intellectual roots in Fascism, writing "postmodernism has been nourished by the
doctrines of Friedrich_Nietzsche, Martin_Heidegger, Maurice_Blanchot, and Paul
de_Manâall of whom either prefigured or succumbed to the proverbial
intellectual fascination with fascism."[120]
Daniel_A._Farber and Suzanna_Sherry criticised Postmodernism for reducing the
complexity of the modern world to an expression of power and for undermining
truth and reason: "If the modern era begins with the European_Enlightenment,
the postmodern era that captivates the radical multiculturalists begins with
its rejection. According to the new radicals, the Enlightenment-inspired ideas
that have previously structured our world, especially the legal and academic
parts of it, are a fraud perpetrated and perpetuated by white males to
consolidate their own power. Those who disagree are not only blind but bigoted.
The Enlightenment's goal of an objective and reasoned basis for knowledge,
merit, truth, justice, and the like is an impossibility: "objectivity," in the
sense of standards of judgment that transcend individual perspectives, does not
exist. Reason is just another code word for the views of the privileged. The
Enlightenment itself merely replaced one socially constructed view of reality
with another, mistaking power for knowledge. There is naught but power."[121]
Richard_Caputo, William_Epstein, David Stoesz & Bruce Thyer consider
postmodernism to be a "dead end in social work epistemology". They write,
"Postmodernism continues to have a detrimental influence on social work,
questioning the Enlightenment, criticizing established research methods, and
challenging scientific authority. The promotion of postmodernism by editors of
Social Work and the Journal of Social Work Education has elevated
postmodernism, placing it on a par with theoretically guided and empirically
based research. The inclusion of postmodernism in the 2008 Educational Policy
and Accreditation Standards of the Council on Social Work Education and its
2015 sequel further erode the knowledge-building capacity of social work
educators. In relation to other disciplines that have exploited empirical
methods, social workâs stature will continue to ebb until postmodernism is
rejected in favor of scientific methods for generating knowledge."[122]
H. Sidky pointed out what he sees as several "inherent flaws" of a postmodern
antiscience perspective, including the confusion of the authority of science
(evidence) with the scientist conveying the knowledge; its self-contradictory
claim that all truths are relative; and its strategic ambiguity. He sees 21st-
century anti-scientific and pseudo-scientific approaches to knowledge,
particularly in the United States, as rooted in a postmodernist "decades-long
academic assault on science:" "Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-
science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders,
policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of
city councils and school boards. Sadly, they forgot the lofty ideals of their
teachers, except that science is bogus."[123]

      LÃ©vi-Strauss, quoting D'Arcy Westworth Thompson states: "To those who
      question the possibility of defining the interrelations between entities
      whose nature is not completely understood, I shall reply with the
      following comment by a great naturalist: In a very large part of
      morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms
      rather than in the precise definition of each; and the deformation of a
      complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the
      figure itself has to be left unanalyzed and undefined."
