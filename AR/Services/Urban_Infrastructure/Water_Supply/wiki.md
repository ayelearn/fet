***** Global access to clean water[edit] *****
Shipot, an underground water source in Budapest
Further information: WASH
In 2010, about 56% of the global population (5.9 billion people) had access to
piped water supply through house connections or to an improved_water_source
through other means than house, including standpipes, water_kiosks, spring
supplies and protected wells. However, about 13% (about 900 million people) did
not have access to an improved water source and had to use unprotected wells or
springs, canals, lakes or rivers for their water needs.[1]
A clean water supplyâin particular, water that is not polluted with fecal
matter from lack of sanitationâis the single most important determinant of
public_health.[citation_needed] Destruction of water supply and/or sanitation
infrastructure after major catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, war, etc.) poses
the immediate threat of severe epidemics of waterborne_diseases, several of
which can be life-threatening.
***** Technical overview[edit] *****
Further information: Water_supply_network
Further information: Water_treatment
Water supply systems get water from a variety of locations after appropriate
treatment, including groundwater (aquifers), surface water (lakes and rivers),
and the sea through desalination. The water_treatment steps include, in most
cases, purification, disinfection through chlorination and sometimes
fluoridation. Treated water then either flows by gravity or is pumped to
reservoirs, which can be elevated such as water_towers or on the ground (for
indicators related to the efficiency of drinking water distribution see non-
revenue_water). Once water is used, wastewater is typically discharged in a
sewer system and treated in a sewage_treatment_plant before being discharged
into a river, lake or the sea or reused for landscaping, irrigation or
industrial use (see also sanitation).
**** Use[edit] ****
Main article: Water_use
In the United_States, the typical single_family_home uses about 520 l
(138 US gal) of water per day (2016 estimate) or 222 l (58.6 US gal) per capita
per day. This includes several common residential_end_use_purposes (in
decreasing order) like toilet use, showers, tap (faucet) use, washing_machine
use, leaks, other (unidentified), baths, and dishwasher use.[2]

***** Service quality[edit] *****
A young girl collects clean water from a communal water supply in Kawempe,
Uganda.
Water supply service_quality has many dimensions: continuity; water_quality;
pressure; and the degree of responsiveness of service providers to customer
complaints. Many people in developing_countries receive a poor or very poor
quality of service.[3]
**** Continuity of supply[edit] ****
Continuity of water supply is taken for granted in most developed countries,
but is a severe problem in many developing countries, where sometimes water is
only provided for a few hours every day or a few days a week. It is estimated
that about half of the population of developing countries receives water on an
intermittent basis.
**** Water quality[edit] ****
Drinking water_quality has a micro-biological and a physico-chemical dimension.
There are thousands of parameters of water quality. In public water supply
systems water should, at a minimum, be disinfectedâmost commonly through the
use of chlorination or the use of ultra_violet lightâor it may need to
undergo treatment, especially in the case of surface_water. For more details,
please see the separate entries on water_quality, water_treatment and drinking
water.
**** Water pressure[edit] ****
1880s model of pumping engine, in Herne_Bay_Museum
Water pressures vary in different locations of a distribution system. Water
mains below the street may operate at higher pressures, with a pressure_reducer
located at each point where the water enters a building or a house. In poorly
managed systems, water pressure can be so low as to result only in a trickle of
water or so high that it leads to damage to plumbing fixtures and waste of
water. Pressure in an urban water system is typically maintained either by a
pressurised water tank serving an urban area, by pumping the water up into a
water_tower and relying on gravity to maintain a constant pressure in the
system or solely by pumps at the water_treatment plant and repeater pumping
stations.
Typical UK pressures are 4â5 bar (60-70 PSI) for an urban supply.[citation
needed] However, some people can get over eight bars or below one bar. A single
iron main pipe may cross a deep valley, it will have the same nominal pressure,
however each consumer will get a bit more or less because of the hydrostatic
pressure (about 1 bar/10 m height). So people at the bottom of a 30-metre
(100 ft) hill will get about 3 bars more than those at the top.
The effective pressure also varies because of the pressure loss due to supply
resistance even for the same static pressure. An urban consumer may have 5
metres of 15 mm pipe running from the iron main, so the kitchen tap flow will
be fairly unrestricted, so high flow. A rural consumer may have a kilometre of
rusted and limed 22 mm iron pipe, so their kitchen tap flow will be small.
For this reason, the UK domestic water system has traditionally (prior to 1989)
employed a "cistern feed" system, where the incoming supply is connected to the
kitchen sink and also a header/storage tank in the attic. Water can dribble
into this tank through a 12 mm pipe, plus ball valve, and then supply the house
on 22 or 28 mm pipes. Gravity water has a small pressure (say Â¼ bar in the
bathroom) so needs wide pipes to allow for higher flows. This is fine for baths
and toilets but is frequently inadequate for showers. A booster_pump or a
hydrophore is installed to increase and maintain pressure. For this reason
urban houses are increasingly using mains pressure boilers ("combies") which
take a long time to fill a bath but suit the high back pressure of a shower.
***** Institutional responsibility and governance[edit] *****
A great variety of institutions have responsibilities in water supply. A basic
distinction is between institutions responsible for policy and regulation on
the one hand; and institutions in charge of providing services on the other
hand.
**** Policy and regulation[edit] ****
Water supply policies and regulation are usually defined by one or several
Ministries, in consultation with the legislative branch. In the United_States
the United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency, whose administrator reports
directly to the President, is responsible for water and sanitation policy and
standard setting within the executive branch. In other countries responsibility
for sector policy is entrusted to a Ministry of Environment (such as in Mexico
and Colombia), to a Ministry of Health (such as in Panama, Honduras and
Uruguay), a Ministry of Public Works (such as in Ecuador and Haiti), a Ministry
of Economy (such as in German states) or a Ministry of Energy (such as in
Iran). A few countries, such as Jordan and Bolivia, even have a Ministry of
Water. Often several Ministries share responsibilities for water supply.
[citation_needed]
In the European Union, important policy functions have been entrusted to the
supranational level. Policy and regulatory functions include the setting of
tariff rules and the approval of tariff increases; setting, monitoring and
enforcing norms for quality of service and environmental protection;
benchmarking the performance of service providers; and reforms in the structure
of institutions responsible for service provision. The distinction between
policy functions and regulatory functions is not always clear-cut. In some
countries they are both entrusted to Ministries, but in others regulatory
functions are entrusted to agencies that are separate from Ministries.[citation

Dozens of countries around the world have established regulatory agencies for
infrastructure services, including often water supply and sanitation, in order
to better protect consumers and to improve efficiency. Regulatory agencies can
be entrusted with a variety of responsibilities, including in particular the
approval of tariff increases and the management of sector information systems,
including benchmarking systems. Sometimes they also have a mandate to settle
complaints by consumers that have not been dealt with satisfactorily by service
providers. These specialized entities are expected to be more competent and
objective in regulating service providers than departments of government
Ministries. Regulatory agencies are supposed to be autonomous from the
executive branch of government, but in many countries have often not been able
to exercise a great degree of autonomy.
In the United_States regulatory agencies for utilities have existed for almost
a century at the level of states, and in Canada at the level of provinces. In
both countries they cover several infrastructure sectors. In many U.S. states
they are called Public_Utility_Commissions. For England and Wales, a regulatory
agency for water (OFWAT) was created as part of the privatization of the water
industry in 1989. In many developing countries, water regulatory agencies were
created during the 1990s in parallel with efforts at increasing private sector
participation. (for more details on regulatory agencies in Latin America, for
example, please see Water_and_sanitation_in_Latin_America and the regional
association of water regulatory agencies ADERASA.[4])
Many countries do not have regulatory agencies for water. In these countries
service providers are regulated directly by local government, or the national
government. This is, for example, the case in the countries of continental
Europe, in China and India.[dubious  – discuss]
**** Service provision[edit] ****
Water supply service providers, which are often utilities, differ from each
other in terms of their geographical coverage relative to administrative
boundaries; their sectoral coverage; their ownership structure; and their
governance arrangements.
*** Geographical coverage[edit] ***
The sole water supply of this section of Wilder, Tennessee, 1942
Many water utilities provide services in a single city, town or municipality.
However, in many countries municipalities have associated in regional or inter-
municipal or multi-jurisdictional utilities to benefit from economies_of_scale.
In the United States these can take the form of special-purpose_districts which
may have independent taxing authority. An example of a multi-jurisdictional
water utility in the United States is WASA, a utility serving Washington,_D.C.
and various localities in the state of Maryland. Multi-jurisdictional utilities
are also common in Germany, where they are known as "Zweckverbaende", in France
and in Italy.
In some federal countries, there are water service providers covering most or
all cities and towns in an entire state, such as in all states of Brazil and
some states in Mexico (see Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Mexico). In England
and Wales, water supply and sewerage is supplied almost entirely through ten
regional companies. Some smaller countries, especially developed countries,
have established service providers that cover the entire country or at least
most of its cities and major towns. Such national service providers are
especially prevalent in West Africa and Central America, but also exist, for
example, in Tunisia, Jordan and Uruguay (see also water_supply_and_sanitation
in_Uruguay). In rural areas, where about half the world population lives, water
services are often not provided by utilities, but by community-based
organizations which usually cover one or sometimes several villages.
*** Sector coverage[edit] ***
Some water utilities provide only water supply services, while sewerage is
under the responsibility of a different entity. This is for example the case in
Tunisia. However, in most cases water utilities also provide sewer and sewage
treatment services. In some cities or countries utilities also distribute
electricity. In a few cases such multi-utilities also collect solid waste and
provide local telephone services. An example of such an integrated utility can
be found in the Colombian city of MedellÃ­n. Utilities that provide water,
sanitation and electricity can be found in Frankfurt, Germany (Mainova), in
Casablanca, Morocco and in Gabon in West Africa. Multi-utilities provide
certain benefits such as common billing and the option to cross-subsidize water
services with revenues from electricity sales, if permitted by law.
*** Ownership and governance arrangements[edit] ***
Water supply providers can be either public, private, mixed or cooperative.
Most urban water supply services around the world are provided by public
entities. As Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange (2002) stated, "The water
crisis that is affecting so many people is mainly a crisis of governanceânot
of water_scarcity." The introduction of cost-reflective tariffs together with
cross-subsidization between richer and poorer consumers is an essential
governance reform in order to reduce the high levels of Unaccounted-for_Water_
(UAW) and to provide the finance needed to extend the network to those poorest
households who remain unconnected. Partnership arrangements between the public
and private sector can play an important role in order to achieve this
objective.[5]
** Private sector participation[edit] **
An estimated 10 percent of urban water supply is provided by private or mixed
public-private companies, usually under concessions, leases or management
contracts. Under these arrangements the public entity that is legally
responsible for service provision delegates certain or all aspects of service
provision to the private service provider for a period typically ranging from 4
to 30 years. The public entity continues to own the assets. These arrangements
are common in France and in Spain. Only in few parts of the world water supply
systems have been completely sold to the private sector (privatization), such
as in England and Wales as well as in Chile. The largest private water
companies in the world are Suez and Veolia_Environnement from France; Aguas de
Barcelona from Spain; and Thames_Water from the UK, all of which are engaged
internationally (see links to website of these companies below). In recent
years, a number of cities have reverted to the public sector in a process
called "remunicipalization".[6]
** Public water service provision[edit] **
90% of urban water supply and sanitation services are currently in the public
sector. They are owned by the state or local authorities, or also by
collectives or cooperatives. They run without an aim for profit but are based
on the ethos of providing a common good considered to be of public interest. In
most middle and low-income countries, these publicly owned and managed water
providers can be inefficient as a result of political interference, leading to
over-staffing and low labor productivity.
Ironically, the main losers from this institutional arrangement are the urban
poor in these countries. Because they are not connected to the network, they
end up paying far more per liter of water than do more well-off households
connected to the network who benefit from the implicit subsidies that they
receive from loss-making utilities.
The fact that we are still so far from achieving universal access to clean
water and sanitation shows that public water authorities, in their current
state, are not working well enough. Yet some are being very successful and are
modelling the best forms of public management. As Ryutaro_Hashimoto, former
Japanese Prime Minister, notes: "Public water services currently provide more
than 90 percent of water supply in the world. Modest improvement in public
water operators will have immense impact on global provision of services."[7]
** Governance arrangements[edit] **
Governance arrangements for both public and private utilities can take many
forms (Kurian and McCarney, 2010).[8] Governance arrangements define the
relationship between the service provider, its owners, its customers and
regulatory entities. They determine the financial autonomy of the service
provider and thus its ability to maintain its assets, expand services, attract
and retain qualified staff, and ultimately to provide high-quality services.
Key aspects of governance arrangements are the extent to which the entity in
charge of providing services is insulated from arbitrary political
intervention; and whether there is an explicit mandate and political will to
allow the service provider to recover all or at least most of its costs through
tariffs and retain these revenues. If water supply is the responsibility of a
department that is integrated in the administration of a city, town or
municipality, there is a risk that tariff revenues are diverted for other
purposes. In some cases, there is also a risk that staff are appointed mainly
on political grounds rather than based on their professional credentials.
**** Standardization[edit] ****
International standards for water supply system are covered by International
Classification of Standards (ICS) 91.140.60.[9]
**** Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers[edit]
****
Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers (utilities)
is needed, because the sector offers limited scope for direct competition
(natural_monopoly). Firms operating in competitive markets are under constant
pressure to out perform each other. Water utilities are often sheltered from
this pressure, and it frequently shows: some utilities are on a sustained
improvement track, but many others keep falling further behind best practice.
Benchmarking the performance of utilities allows the stimulation of
competition, establish realistic targets for improvement and create pressure to
catch up with better utilities. Information on benchmarks for water and
sanitation utilities is provided by the International Benchmarking Network for
Water and Sanitation Utilities.[10]
***** Financial aspects[edit] *****
**** Costs and financing[edit] ****
The cost of supplying water consists, to a very large extent, of fixed costs
(capital costs and personnel costs) and only to a small extent of variable
costs that depend on the amount of water consumed (mainly energy and
chemicals). The full cost of supplying water in urban areas in developed
countries is about US$1â2 per cubic meter depending on local costs and local
water_consumption levels. The cost of sanitation (sewerage and wastewater
treatment) is another US$1â2 per cubic meter. These costs are somewhat lower
in developing countries. Throughout the world, only part of these costs is
usually billed to consumers, the remainder being financed through direct or
indirect subsidies from local, regional or national governments (see section on
tariffs).
Besides subsidies water supply investments are financed through internally
generated revenues as well as through debt. Debt financing can take the form of
credits from commercial Banks, credits from international financial
institutions such as the World Bank and regional development banks (in the case
of developing countries), and bonds (in the case of some developed countries
and some upper middle-income countries).
**** Tariffs[edit] ****
Almost all service providers in the world charge tariffs to recover part of
their costs. According to estimates by the World Bank the average (mean) global
water tariff is US$0.53 per cubic meter. In developed countries the average
tariff is US$1.04, while it is only U$0.11 in the poorest developing countries.
The lowest tariffs in developing countries are found in South Asia (mean of
US$0.09/m3), while the highest are found in Latin America (US$0.41/m3).[11]
Data for 132 cities were assessed. The tariff is estimate for a consumption
level of 15 cubic meters per month. Few utilities do recover all their costs.
According to the same World Bank study only 30% of utilities globally, and only
50% of utilities in developed countries, generate sufficient revenue to cover
operation, maintenance and partial capital costs.
According to another study undertaken in 2006 by NUS Consulting, the average
water and sewerage tariff in 14 mainly OECD countries excluding VAT varied
between US$0.66 per cubic meter in the United States and the equivalent of
US$2.25 per cubic meter in Denmark.[12] However, water consumption is much
higher in the US than in Europe. Therefore, residential water bills may be very
similar, even if the tariff per unit of consumption tends to be higher in
Europe than in the US.
A typical family on the US East Coast paid between US$30 and US$70 per month
for water and sewer services in 2005.[13]
In developing countries, tariffs are usually much further from covering costs.
Residential water bills for a typical consumption of 15 cubic meters per month
vary between less than US$1 and US$12 per month.[14]
Water and sanitation tariffs, which are almost always billed together, can take
many different forms. Where meters are installed, tariffs are typically
volumetric (per usage), sometimes combined with a small monthly fixed charge.
In the absence of meters, flat or fixed rates â which are independent of
actual consumption â are being charged. In developed countries, tariffs are
usually the same for different categories of users and for different levels of
consumption.
In developing countries, the situation is often characterized by cross-
subsidies with the intent to make water more affordable for residential low-
volume users that are assumed to be poor. For example, industrial and
commercial users are often charged higher tariffs than public or residential
users. Also, metered users are often charged higher tariffs for higher levels
of consumption (increasing-block tariffs). However, cross-subsidies between
residential users do not always reach their objective. Given the overall low
level of water tariffs in developing countries even at higher levels of
consumption, most consumption subsidies benefit the wealthier segments of
society.[15] Also, high industrial and commercial tariffs can provide an
incentive for these users to supply water from other sources than the utility
(own wells, water tankers) and thus actually erode the utility's revenue base.
***** Metering[edit] *****
Main articles: Water_metering and Water_meter
A typical residential water meter
Metering of water supply is usually motivated by one or several of four
objectives: First, it provides an incentive to conserve water which protects
water resources (environmental objective). Second, it can postpone costly
system expansion and saves energy and chemical costs (economic objective).
Third, it allows a utility to better locate distribution losses (technical
objective). Fourth, it allows suppliers to charge for water based on use, which
is perceived by many as the fairest way to allocate the costs of water supply
to users. Metering is considered good practice in water supply and is
widespread in developed countries, except for the United_Kingdom. In developing
countries it is estimated that half of all urban water supply systems are
metered and the tendency is increasing.
Water_meters are read by one of several methods:
    * the water customer writes down the meter reading and mails in a postcard
      with this info to the water department;
    * the water customer writes down the meter reading and uses a phone dial-in
      system to transfer this info to the water department;
    * the water customer logs into the website of the water supply company,
      enters the address, meter ID and meter readings [3]
    * a meter reader comes to the premises and enters the meter reading into a
      handheld computer;
    * the meter reading is echoed on a display unit mounted to the outside of
      the premises, where a meter reader records them;
    * a small radio is hooked up to the meter to automatically transmit
      readings to corresponding receivers in handheld computers, utility
      vehicles or distributed collectors
    * a small computer is hooked up to the meter that can either dial out or
      receive automated phone calls that give the reading to a central computer
      system.
Most cities are increasingly installing Automatic_Meter_Reading (AMR) systems
to prevent fraud, to lower ever-increasing labor and liability costs and to
improve customer service and satisfaction.
***** Health aspects[edit] *****
**** Outbreaks of diseases due to contaminated water supply[edit] ****
Water supply can get contaminated by pathogens which may originate from human
excreta, for example due to a break-down or design fault in the sanitation
system, or by chemical contaminants.
Examples of contamination include:
    * In 1854, a cholera_outbreak_in_London's_Soho_district was identified by
      Dr._John_Snow as originating from contaminated water from the Broad
      Street pump. This can be regarded as a founding event of the science of
      epidemiology.
    * In 1980, a hepatitis A surge due to the consumption of water from a
      feces-contaminated well, in Pennsylvania[16]
    * In 1987, a cryptosporidiosis outbreak is caused by the public water
      supply of which the filtration was contaminated, in western Georgia[17]
    * In 1993, Milwaukee_Cryptosporidium_outbreak
    * An outbreak of typhoid fever in northern Israel, which was associated
      with the contaminated municipal water supply[18]
    * In 1997, 369 cases of cryptosporidiosis occurred, caused by a
      contaminated fountain in the Minnesota zoo. Most of the sufferers were
      children[19]
    * In 1998, a non-chlorinated municipal water supply was blamed for a
      campylobacteriosis outbreak in northern Finland[20]
    * In 2000, a gastroenteritis outbreak that was brought by a non-chlorinated
      community water supply, in southern Finland[21]
    * In 2000, an E._coli outbreak occurred in Walkerton,_Ontario, Canada.
      Seven_people_died_from_drinking_contaminated_water. Hundreds suffered
      from the symptoms of the disease, not knowing if they too would die.[22]
    * In 2004, contamination of the community water supply, serving the Bergen
      city centre of Norway, was later reported after the outbreak of
      waterborne giardiasis[23]
    * In 2007, contaminated drinking water was pinpointed which had led to the
      outbreak of gastroenteritis with multiple aetiologies in Denmark[24]
Examples of chemical contamination include:
    * In 1988, many people were poisoned in Camelford, when a worker put 20
      tonnes of aluminium sulphate in the wrong tank.
    * In 1993, a fluoride poisoning outbreak resulting from overfeeding of
      fluoride, in Mississippi[25]
***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_water_supply_and_sanitation
Throughout history, people have devised systems to make getting and using water
more convenient. Living in semi-arid regions, ancient Persians in the 1st
millennium BC used qanat system to gain access to water in the mountains. Early
Rome had indoor plumbing, meaning a system of aqueducts and pipes that
terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains for people to use.
Until the Enlightenment_era, little progress was made in water supply and
sanitation and the engineering skills of the Romans were largely neglected
throughout Europe. It was in the 18th century that a rapidly growing population
fueled a boom in the establishment of private water supply networks in London.
The Chelsea_Waterworks_Company was established in 1723 "for the better
supplying the City and Liberties of Westminster and parts adjacent with water".
[26][27] Other waterworks were established in London, including at West_Ham in
1743, at Lea_Bridge before 1767, Lambeth_Waterworks_Company in 1785, West
Middlesex_Waterworks_Company in 1806[28] and Grand_Junction_Waterworks_Company
in 1811.[29]
The S-bend pipe was invented by Alexander_Cummings in 1775 but became known as
the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas_Crapper in
1880. The first screw-down water_tap was patented in 1845 by Guest and Chrimes,
a brass foundry in Rotherham.[30]

industrialization waterworks and fountain.
Chelsea Waterworks, 1752. Two Newcomen beam engines pumped Thames water from a
canal to reservoirs at Green Park and Hyde Park.
In ancient_Peru, the Nazca_people employed a system of interconnected wells and
an underground watercourse known as puquios. In Spain and Spanish_America, a
community operated watercourse known as an acequia, combined with a simple sand
filtration system, provided potable water. Beginning in the Roman_era a water
wheel device known as a noria supplied water to aqueducts and other water
distribution systems in major cities in Europe and the Middle East. London
water_supply_infrastructure developed over many centuries from early mediaeval
conduits, through major 19th-century treatment works built in response to
cholera threats, to modern, large-scale reservoirs.
Water_towers appeared around the late 19th century; as building height rose,
and steam, electric and diesel-powered water_pumps became available. As
skyscrapers appeared, they needed rooftop_water_towers.
The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied
chlorine gas was developed in 1910 by U.S._Army Major (later Brig._Gen.) Carl
Rogers_Darnall (1867â1941), professor of chemistry at the Army_Medical
School. Shortly thereafter, Major (later Col.) William_J._L._Lyster
(1869â1947) of the Army_Medical_Department used a solution of calcium
hypochlorite in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster's method
remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps,
implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster_Bag (also spelled Lister Bag).
Darnall's work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water
purification.
Desalination appeared during the late 20th century, and is still limited to a
few areas.
During the beginning of the 21st Century, especially in areas of urban and
suburban population centers, traditional centralized infrastructure have not
been able to supply sufficient quantities of water to keep up with growing
demand. Among several options that have been managed are the extensive use of
desalination technology, this is especially prevalent in coastal areas and in
"dry" countries like Australia. Decentralization of water infrastructure has
grown extensively as a viable solution including Rainwater_harvesting and
Stormwater_harvesting where policies are eventually tending towards a more
rational use and sourcing of water incorporation concepts such as "Fit for
Purpose". Emirians have the highest per capita water consumption rate in the
world, at 133 gallons.[31]
**** Water treatment[edit] ****
Original map by John_Snow showing the clusters of cholera cases in the London
epidemic_of_1854
The first documented use of sand_filters to purify the water supply dates to
1804, when the owner of a bleachery in Paisley,_Scotland, John Gibb, installed
an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public. The first
treated public water supply in the world was installed by engineer James
Simpson for the Chelsea_Waterworks_Company in London in 1829.[32] The practice
of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were
made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician John_Snow
during the 1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak demonstrated the role of the
water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic.[33]
The Metropolis_Water_Act introduced regulation of the water supply companies in
London, including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The
Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and
wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31
December 1855.[34] This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state
public health interventions across Europe.[35]
Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty slow_sand_filter and
a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in Lincoln,
England.[36] Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water
to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride
of lime to the water being treated.[37] The first continuous use of chlorine in
the United_States for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on
the Rockaway_River), which served as the supply for Jersey_City,_New_Jersey.
[38] Desalination appeared during the late 20th century, and is still limited
to a few areas.
The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied
chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the Indian_Medical_Service,
Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903.[39] U.S._Army Major Carl_Rogers_Darnall,
Professor of Chemistry at the Army_Medical_School, gave the first practical
demonstration of this in 1910. This work became the basis for present day
systems of municipal water purification.
***** Society and culture[edit] *****
**** Women and water supply issues in developing countries[edit] ****
Main article: Water_supply_and_women_in_developing_countries
Water supply issues have specific adverse effects on women in developing
nations. Women are often the primary family member responsible for providing
water as well as collecting it. Inclusion of women in the design and
implementation of water supply projects is an area of concern currently being
addressed by multiple world organizations.
