Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of a surface's water and sub-
surface_water from an area with excess of water. The internal drainage of most
agricultural soils is good enough to prevent severe waterlogging (anaerobic
conditions that harm root growth), but many soils need artificial drainage to
improve production or to manage water supplies.

***** History[edit] *****
**** Early history[edit] ****
Remains of a drain at Lothal circa 3000 BC
The Indus_Valley_Civilization had advanced sewerage and drainage systems. All
houses in the major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had access to water and
drainage facilities. Waste water was directed to covered gravity_sewers, which
lined the major streets.[1]
**** 18th and 19th century[edit] ****
Tank_Stream, a historical drain in the City of Sydney
The invention of hollow-pipe drainage is credited to Sir Hugh Dalrymple, who
died in 1753.[2]
***** Current practices[edit] *****
A plastic (PVC) flexible drainage pipe, used to drain water from the roof of a
residential house or building
**** Geotextiles[edit] ****
New drainage systems incorporate geotextile filters that retain and prevent
fine grains of soil from passing into and clogging the drain. Geotextiles are
synthetic textile fabrics specially manufactured for civil and environmental
engineering applications. Geotextiles are designed to retain fine soil
particles while allowing water to pass through. In a typical drainage system,
they would be laid along a trench which would then be filled with coarse
granular_material: gravel, sea_shells, stone or rock. The geotextile is then
folded over the top of the stone and the trench is then covered by soil.
Groundwater seeps through the geotextile and flows through the stone to an
outfell. In high groundwater conditions a perforated plastic (PVC or PE) pipe
is laid along the base of the drain to increase the volume of water transported
in the drain.
Alternatively, a prefabricated plastic drainage system made of HDPE, often
incorporating geotextile, coco_fiber or rag filters can be considered. The use
of these materials has become increasingly more common due to their ease of use
which eliminates the need for transporting and laying stone drainage aggregate
which is invariably more expensive than a synthetic drain and concrete liners.
Over the past 30 years geotextile, PVC filters and HDPE filters have become the
most commonly used soil filter media. They are cheap to produce and easy to
lay, with factory controlled properties that ensure long term filtration
performance even in fine silty soil conditions.
**** 21st century alternatives[edit] ****
Seattle's Public Utilities created a pilot program called Street Edge
Alternatives (SEA Streets) Project. The project focuses on designing a system
"to provide drainage that more closely mimics the natural landscape prior to
development than traditional piped systems".[3] The streets are characterized
by ditches along the side of the roadway, with plantings designed throughout
the area. An emphasis on non curbed sidewalks allows water to flow more freely
into the areas of permeable surface on the side of the streets. Because of the
plantings, the run off water from the urban area does not all directly go into
the ground, but can also be absorbed into the surrounding environment.
Monitoring conducted by Seattle Public Utilities reports a 99 percent reduction
of storm water leaving the drainage project[3]
Drainage has undergone a large-scale environmental review in the recent past in
the United Kingdom. Sustainable_Urban_Drainage_Systems (SUDS) are designed to
encourage contractors to install drainage system that more closely mimic the
natural flow of water in nature. Since 2010 local and neighbourhood planning in
the UK is required by law to factor SUDS into any development projects that
they are responsible for.
Slot_drainage has proved the most breakthrough product of the last twenty years
as a drainage option. As a channel drainage system it is designed to eliminate
the need for further pipework systems to be installed in parallel to the
drainage, reducing the environmental impact of production as well as improving
water collection. Stainless_steel, concrete channel, PVC and HDPE are all
materials available for slot drainage which have become industry standards on
construction projects.
**** Drainage in the construction industry[edit] ****
Piping being placed for a sink
The civil_engineer is responsible for drainage in construction projects. They
set out from the plans all the roads, street_gutters, drainage, culverts and
sewers involved in construction operations. During the construction process he/
she will set out all the necessary levels for each of the previously mentioned
factors.
Civil engineers and construction managers work alongside architects and
supervisors, planners, quantity_surveyors, the general workforce, as well as
subcontractors. Typically, most jurisdictions have some body of drainage_law to
govern to what degree a landowner can alter the drainage from his parcel.
Drainage options for the construction industry include:
    * Point drainage, which intercepts water at gullies (points). Gullies
      connect to drainage pipes beneath the ground surface and deep excavation
      is required to facilitate this system. Support for deep trenches is
      required in the shape of planking, strutting or shoring.
    * Channel drainage, which intercepts water along the entire run of the
      channel. Channel drainage is typically manufactured from concrete, steel,
      polymer or composites. The interception rate of channel drainage is
      greater than point drainage and the excavation required is usually much
      less deep.
The surface opening of channel drainage usually comes in the form of gratings
(polymer, plastic, steel or iron) or a single slot (slot drain) that runs along
the ground surface (typically manufactured from steel or iron).
**** Drainage in retaining walls[edit] ****
Earth retaining structures such as retaining_walls also need to consider
groundwater drainage. Typical retaining walls are constructed of impermeable
material which can block the path of groundwater. When groundwater flow is
obstructed, hydrostatic water_pressure buildups against the wall and may cause
significant damage. If the water pressure is not drained appropriately,
retaining walls can bow, move, fracture and seams separate. The water pressure
can also erode soil particles leading to voids behind the wall and sinkholes in
the above soil. Traditional retaining wall drainage systems can include, French
Drains, drain pipes or weep holes. To prevent soil erosion, Geotextile filter
fabrics are installed with the drainage system.
**** Drainage in urban vegetation[edit] ****
Research evaluating drainage quantity and quality in urban mixed landscapes
vegetation is limited. Insufficiencies and obstacles in understanding soil
water conditions particularly in urban landscape environs undermine a sound
judgement of urban soils. A research in South Australia investigates the
relative impact of landscape variation on drainage and solute leaching in a
public park containing heterogeneous urban-landscape vegetation that is
irrigated with recycled wastewater. For this purpose, two pan lysimeters were
designed and installed in two different land-scape zones.[4]
***** Reasons for artificial drainage[edit] *****
An agricultural drainage channel outside Magome, Japan after a heavy rain. Note
that protuberances create turbulent water, preventing sediment from settling in
the channel.
Wetland soils may need drainage to be used for agriculture. In the northern
United States and Europe, glaciation created numerous small lakes which
gradually filled with humus to make marshes. Some of these were drained using
open ditches and trenches to make mucklands, which are primarily used for high
value crops such as vegetables.
The largest project of this type in the world has been in process for centuries
in the Netherlands. The area between Amsterdam, Haarlem and Leiden was, in
prehistoric times swampland and small lakes. Turf cutting (Peat mining),
subsidence and shoreline erosion gradually caused the formation of one large
lake, the Haarlemmermeer, or lake of Haarlem. The invention of wind-powered
pumping_engines in the 15th century permitted drainage of some of the marginal
land, but the final drainage of the lake had to await the design of large,
steam_powered pumps and agreements between regional authorities. The
elimination of the lake occurred between 1849 and 1852, creating thousands of
kmÂ² of new land.
Coastal plains and river deltas may have seasonally or permanently high water
tables and must have drainage improvements if they are to be used for
agriculture. An example is the flatwoods citrus-growing region of Florida.
After periods of high rainfall, drainage pumps are employed to prevent damage
to the citrus groves from overly wet soils. Rice production requires complete
control of water, as fields need to be flooded or drained at different stages
of the crop cycle. The Netherlands has also led the way in this type of
drainage, not only to drain lowland along the shore, but actually pushing back
the sea until the original nation has been greatly enlarged.
In moist climates, soils may be adequate for cropping with the exception that
they become waterlogged for brief periods each year, from snow melt or from
heavy rains. Soils that are predominantly clay will pass water very slowly
downward, meanwhile plant roots suffocate because the excessive water around
the roots eliminates air movement through the soil.
Other soils may have an impervious layer of mineralized soil, called a hardpan
or relatively impervious rock layers may underlie shallow soils. Drainage is
especially important in tree_fruit production. Soils that are otherwise
excellent may be waterlogged for a week of the year, which is sufficient to
kill fruit trees and cost the productivity of the land until replacements can
be established. In each of these cases appropriate drainage carries off
temporary flushes of water to prevent damage to annual or perennial crops.
Drier areas are often farmed by irrigation, and one would not consider drainage
necessary. However, irrigation water always contains minerals and salts, which
can be concentrated to toxic levels by evapotranspiration. Irrigated land may
need periodic flushes with excessive irrigation water and drainage to control
soil_salinity.
