Water treatment is any process that improves the quality of water to make it
more acceptable for a specific end-use. The end use may be drinking, industrial
water supply, irrigation, river flow maintenance, water recreation or many
other uses, including being safely returned to the environment. Water treatment
removes contaminants and undesirable components, or reduces their concentration
so that the water becomes fit for its desired end-use. This treatment is
crucial to human health and allows humans to benefit from both drinking and
irrigation use.

***** History[edit] *****
Further information: History_of_water_supply_and_sanitation
Early water treatment methods included sand filtration and chlorination. The
first documented use of sand_filters to purify the water supply dates to 1804,
when the owner of a bleachery in Paisley,_Scotland, John Gibb, installed an
experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.[1][2] This
method was refined in the following two decades, and it culminated in the first
treated public water supply in the world, installed by the Chelsea_Waterworks
Company in London in 1829.[3][4]
***** Treatment for drinking water production[edit] *****
Main articles: Water_purification and Drinking_water_quality_standards
Treatment for drinking_water production involves the removal of contaminants
from raw water to produce water that is pure enough for human consumption
without any short term or long term risk of any adverse health effect. In
general terms, the greatest microbial risks are associated with ingestion of
water that is contaminated with human or animal (including bird) faeces. Faeces
can be a source of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths.
[Guidelines for Drinking-water quality]. Substances that are removed during the
process of drinking water treatment, Disinfection is of unquestionable
importance in the supply of safe drinking-water. The destruction of microbial
pathogens is essential and very commonly involves the use of reactive chemical
agents such suspended_solids, bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi, and minerals
such as iron and manganese. These substances continue to cause great harm to
several lower developed countries who do not have access to water purification.
The processes involved in removing the contaminants include physical processes
such as settling and filtration, chemical_processes such as disinfection and
coagulation and biological processes such as slow_sand_filtration.
Measures taken to ensure water quality not only relate to the treatment of the
water, but to its conveyance and distribution after treatment. It is therefore
common practice to keep residual disinfectants in the treated water to kill
bacteriological contamination during distribution.
World_Health_Organization (WHO) guidelines are a general set of standards
intended to apply where better local standards are not implemented. More
rigorous standards apply across Europe, the USA and in most other developed
countries.
Water supplied to domestic properties, for tap_water or other uses, may be
further treated before use, often using an in-line treatment process. Such
treatments can include water_softening or ion exchange. Many proprietary
systems also claim to remove residual disinfectants and heavy_metal ions.

**** Processes[edit] ****
Empty aeration tank for iron precipitation
Tanks with sand filters to remove precipitated iron (not working at the time)
A combination selected from the following processes is used for municipal
drinking water treatment worldwide:
    * Pre-chlorination for algae control and arresting biological growth
    * Aeration along with pre-chlorination for removal of dissolved iron when
      present with small amounts relatively of manganese
    * Coagulation for flocculation or slow-sand filtration
    * Coagulant aids, also known as polyelectrolytes â to improve coagulation
      and for more robust floc formation
    * Sedimentation for solids separation that is the removal of suspended
      solids trapped in the floc
    * Filtration to remove particles from water either by passage through a
      sand bed that can be washed and reused or by passage through a purpose
      designed filter that may be washable.
    * Disinfection for killing bacteria, viruses and other pathogens.
Technologies for potable water and other uses are well developed, and
generalized designs are available from which treatment processes can be
selected for pilot testing on the specific source water. In addition, a number
of private companies provide patented technological solutions for the treatment
of specific contaminants. Automation of water treatment is common in the
developed world. Source water quality through the seasons, scale, and
environmental impact can dictate capital costs and operating costs. End use of
the treated water dictates the necessary quality monitoring technologies, and
locally available skills typically dictate the level of automation adopted.

***** Industrial water treatment[edit] *****
Main article: Industrial_water_treatment
Two of the main processes of industrial water treatment are boiler water
treatment and cooling water treatment. A large amount of proper water treatment
can lead to the reaction of solids and bacteria within pipe work and boiler
housing. Steam boilers can suffer from scale or corrosion when left untreated.
Scale deposits can lead to weak and dangerous machinery, while additional fuel
is required to heat the same level of water because of the rise in thermal
resistance. Poor quality dirty water can become a breeding ground for bacteria
such as Legionella causing a risk to public health.
Corrosion in low pressure boilers can be caused by dissolved oxygen, acidity
and excessive alkalinity. Water treatment therefore should remove the dissolved
oxygen and maintain the boiler water with the appropriate pH and alkalinity
levels. Without effective water treatment, a cooling water system can suffer
from scale formation, corrosion and fouling and may become a breeding ground
for harmful bacteria. This reduces efficiency, shortens plant life and makes
operations unreliable and unsafe.[5]
***** Desalination[edit] *****
Main article: Desalination
Saline water can be treated to yield fresh water. Two main processes are used,
reverse_osmosis or distillation.[6] Both methods require more energy than water
treatment of local surface waters, and are usually only used in coastal areas
or where water such as groundwater has high salinity.[7]
***** Portable water purification[edit] *****
Main article: Portable_water_purification
Living away from drinking water supplies often requires some form of portable
water treatment process. These can vary in complexity from the simple addition
of a disinfectant tablet in a hiker's water bottle through to complex multi-
stage processes carried by boat or plane to disaster areas.
***** Ultra pure water production[edit] *****
Some industries such as the production of silicon_wafers, space technology and
many high quality metallurgical process require ultrapure_water. The production
of such water typically involves many stages, and can include reverse osmosis,
ion exchange and several distillation stages using solid tin apparatus. This
method is extremely useful by making water production extremely pure by the EPA
water quality standards.
***** Developing countries[edit] *****
Further information: Self-supply_of_water_and_sanitation
Appropriate_technology options in water treatment include both community-scale
and household-scale point-of-use (POU) or self-supply designs.[8] Such designs
may employ solar_water_disinfection methods, using solar irradiation to
inactivate harmful waterborne microorganisms directly, mainly by the UV-
A component of the solar spectrum, or indirectly through the presence of an
oxide photocatalyst, typically supported TiO2 in its anatase or rutile phases.
[9] Despite progress in SODIS technology, military surplus water treatment
units like the ERDLator are still frequently used in developing countries.
Newer military style Reverse_Osmosis_Water_Purification_Units (ROWPU) are
portable, self-contained water treatment plants are becoming more available for
public use.[10]
For waterborne disease reduction to last, water treatment programs that
research and development groups start in developing_countries must be
sustainable by the citizens of those countries. This can ensure the efficiency
of such programs after the departure of the research team, as monitoring is
difficult because of the remoteness of many locations.
***** Energy consumption[edit] *****
Water treatment plants can be significant consumers of energy. In California,
more than 4% of the state's electricity consumption goes towards transporting
moderate quality water over long distances, treating that water to a high
standard.[11] In areas with high quality water sources which flow by gravity to
the point of consumption,, costs will be much lower. Much of the energy
requirements are in pumping. Processes that avoid the need for pumping tend to
have overall low energy demands. Those water treatment technologies that have
very low energy requirements including trickling_filters, slow_sand_filters,
gravity aqueducts.
***** Regulation[edit] *****
Main article: Drinking_water_quality_standards
**** United States[edit] ****
The Safe_Drinking_Water_Act requires the U.S._Environmental_Protection_Agency
(EPA) to set standards for drinking water quality in public_water_systems
(entities that provide water for human consumption to at least 25 people for at
least 60 days a year).[12] Enforcement of the standards is mostly carried out
by state health agencies.[13] States may set standards that are more stringent
than the federal standards.[14]
EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants organized into six groups:
microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic chemicals,
organic chemicals and radionuclides.[15]
EPA also identifies and lists unregulated contaminants which may require
regulation. The Contaminant_Candidate_List is published every five years, and
EPA is required to decide whether to regulate at least five or more listed
contaminants.[16]
Local drinking water utilities may apply for low interest loans, to make
facility improvements, through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.[17]
