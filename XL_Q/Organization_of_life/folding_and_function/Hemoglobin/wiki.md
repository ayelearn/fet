Hemoglobin (American English) or haemoglobin (British English) (/
ËhiËmÉËÉ¡loÊbÉªn,_ËhÉ-,_-moÊ-/[1][2][3]), abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the
iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red_blood_cells
(erythrocytes) of almost all vertebrates[4] (the exception being the fish
family Channichthyidae[5]) as well as the tissues of some invertebrates.
Hemoglobin in blood carries oxygen from the lungs or gills to the rest of the
body (i.e. the tissues). There it releases the oxygen to permit aerobic
respiration to provide energy to power the functions of the organism in the
process called metabolism. A healthy individual has 12 to 20 grams of
hemoglobin in every 100 ml of blood.
In mammals, the protein makes up about 96% of the red blood cells' dry content
(by weight), and around 35% of the total content (including water).[6]
Hemoglobin has an oxygen-binding capacity of 1.34 mL O2 per gram,[7] which
increases the total blood_oxygen_capacity seventy-fold compared to dissolved
oxygen in blood. The mammalian hemoglobin molecule can bind (carry) up to four
oxygen molecules.[8]
Hemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases: It carries some of the
body's respiratory carbon_dioxide (about 20â25% of the total[9]) as
carbaminohemoglobin, in which CO2 is bound to the heme protein. The molecule
also carries the important regulatory molecule nitric_oxide bound to a globin
protein thiol group, releasing it at the same time as oxygen.[10]
Hemoglobin is also found outside red blood cells and their progenitor lines.
Other cells that contain hemoglobin include the A9_dopaminergic_neurons in the
substantia_nigra, macrophages, alveolar_cells, lungs, retinal pigment
epithelium, hepatocytes, mesangial_cells in the kidney, endometrial cells,
cervical cells and vaginal epithelial cells.[11] In these tissues, hemoglobin
has a non-oxygen-carrying function as an antioxidant and a regulator of iron
metabolism.[12] Excessive glucose in one's blood can attach to hemoglobin and
raise the level of hemoglobin A1c.[13]
Hemoglobin and hemoglobin-like molecules are also found in many invertebrates,
fungi, and plants.[14] In these organisms, hemoglobins may carry oxygen, or
they may act to transport and regulate other small molecules and ions such as
carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfide. A variant of the
molecule, called leghemoglobin, is used to scavenge oxygen away from anaerobic
systems, such as the nitrogen-fixing nodules of leguminous plants, lest the
oxygen poison (deactivate) the system.
Hemoglobinemia is a medical condition in which there is an excess of hemoglobin
in the blood_plasma. This is an effect of intravascular_hemolysis, in which
hemoglobin separates from red_blood_cells, a form of anemia.

***** Research history[edit] *****
Max_Perutz, one of the founding fathers of molecular biology[15]
In 1825 J. F. Engelhard discovered that the ratio of iron to protein is
identical in the hemoglobins of several species.[16] From the known atomic mass
of iron he calculated the molecular mass of hemoglobin to n Ã 16000 (n =
number of iron atoms per hemoglobin, now known to be 4), the first
determination of a protein's molecular mass. This "hasty conclusion" drew a lot
of ridicule at the time from scientists who could not believe that any molecule
could be that big. Gilbert_Smithson_Adair confirmed Engelhard's results in 1925
by measuring the osmotic pressure of hemoglobin solutions.[17]
The oxygen-carrying property of hemoglobin was discovered by HÃ¼nefeld in 1840.
[18] In 1851,[19] German physiologist Otto_Funke published a series of articles
in which he described growing hemoglobin crystals by successively diluting red
blood cells with a solvent such as pure water, alcohol or ether, followed by
slow evaporation of the solvent from the resulting protein solution.[20]
Hemoglobin's reversible oxygenation was described a few years later by Felix
Hoppe-Seyler.[21]
In 1959, Max_Perutz determined the molecular structure of hemoglobin by X-ray
crystallography.[22][23] This work resulted in his sharing with John_Kendrew
the 1962 Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry for their studies of the structures of
globular proteins.
The role of hemoglobin in the blood was elucidated by French physiologist
Claude_Bernard. The name hemoglobin is derived from the words heme and globin,
reflecting the fact that each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular_protein with
an embedded heme group. Each heme group contains one iron atom, that can bind
one oxygen molecule through ion-induced dipole forces. The most common type of
hemoglobin in mammals contains four such subunits.
***** Genetics[edit] *****
Hemoglobin consists of protein_subunits (the "globin" molecules), and these
proteins, in turn, are folded chains of a large number of different amino acids
called polypeptides. The amino acid sequence of any polypeptide created by a
cell is in turn determined by the stretches of DNA called genes. In all
proteins, it is the amino acid sequence that determines the protein's chemical
properties and function.
There is more than one hemoglobin gene: in humans, hemoglobin A (the main form
of hemoglobin present) is coded for by the genes, HBA1, HBA2, and HBB.[24] The
amino acid sequences of the globin proteins in hemoglobins usually differ
between species. These differences grow with evolutionary distance between
species. For example, the most common hemoglobin sequences in humans and
chimpanzees are nearly identical, differing by only one amino acid in both the
alpha and the beta globin protein chains.[25] These differences grow larger
between less closely related species.
Even within a species, different variants of hemoglobin always exist, although
one sequence is usually a "most common" one in each species. Mutations in the
genes for the hemoglobin protein in a species result in hemoglobin_variants.
[26][27] Many of these mutant forms of hemoglobin cause no disease. Some of
these mutant forms of hemoglobin, however, cause a group of hereditary_diseases
termed the hemoglobinopathies. The best known hemoglobinopathy is sickle-cell
disease, which was the first human disease whose mechanism was understood at
the molecular level. A (mostly) separate set of diseases called thalassemias
involves underproduction of normal and sometimes abnormal hemoglobins, through
problems and mutations in globin gene_regulation. All these diseases produce
anemia.[28]
Protein alignment of human hemoglobin proteins, alpha, beta, and delta subunits
respectively. The alignments were created using Uniprot's alignment tool
available online.
Variations in hemoglobin amino acid sequences, as with other proteins, may be
adaptive. For example, hemoglobin has been found to adapt in different ways to
high altitudes. Organisms living at high elevations experience lower partial
pressures of oxygen compared to those at sea level. This presents a challenge
to the organisms that inhabit such environments because hemoglobin, which
normally binds oxygen at high partial pressures of oxygen, must be able to bind
oxygen when it is present at a lower pressure. Different organisms have adapted
to such a challenge. For example, recent studies have suggested genetic
variants in deer mice that help explain how deer mice that live in the
mountains are able to survive in the thin air that accompanies high altitudes.
A researcher from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found mutations in four
different genes that can account for differences between deer mice that live in
lowland prairies versus the mountains. After examining wild mice captured from
both highlands and lowlands, it was found that: the genes of the two breeds are
"virtually identicalâexcept for those that govern the oxygen-carrying
capacity of their hemoglobin". "The genetic difference enables highland mice to
make more efficient use of their oxygen", since less is available at higher
altitudes, such as those in the mountains.[29] Mammoth hemoglobin featured
mutations that allowed for oxygen delivery at lower temperatures, thus enabling
mammoths to migrate to higher latitudes during the Pleistocene.[30] This was
also found in hummingbirds that inhabit the Andes. Hummingbirds already expend
a lot of energy and thus have high oxygen demands and yet Andean hummingbirds
have been found to thrive in high altitudes. Non-synonymous mutations in the
hemoglobin gene of multiple species living at high elevations (Oreotrochilus,
A. castelnaudii, C. violifer, P. gigas, and A. viridicuada) have caused the
protein to have less of an affinity for inositol_hexaphosphate (IHP), a
molecule found in birds that has a similar role as 2,3-BPG in humans; this
results in the ability to bind oxygen in lower partial pressures.[31]
Birds' unique circulatory_lungs also promote efficient use of oxygen at low
partial pressures of O2. These two adaptations reinforce each other and account
for birds' remarkable high-altitude performance.
Hemoglobin adaptation extends to humans, as well. Studies have found that a
small number of native Tibetan women have a genotype which codes for hemoglobin
to be more highly saturated with oxygen.[32] Natural selection seems to be the
main force working on this gene because the mortality rate of offspring is
significantly lower for women with higher hemoglobin-oxygen affinity when
compared to the mortality rate of offspring from women with low hemoglobin-
oxygen affinity. While the exact genotype and mechanism by which this occurs is
not yet clear, selection is acting on these women's ability to bind oxygen in
low partial pressures, which overall allows them to better sustain crucial
metabolic processes.
***** Synthesis[edit] *****
Hemoglobin (Hb) is synthesized in a complex series of steps. The heme part is
synthesized in a series of steps in the mitochondria and the cytosol of
immature red blood cells, while the globin protein parts are synthesized by
ribosomes in the cytosol.[33] Production of Hb continues in the cell throughout
its early development from the proerythroblast to the reticulocyte in the bone
marrow. At this point, the nucleus is lost in mammalian red blood cells, but
not in birds and many other species. Even after the loss of the nucleus in
mammals, residual ribosomal_RNA allows further synthesis of Hb until the
reticulocyte loses its RNA soon after entering the vasculature (this
hemoglobin-synthetic RNA in fact gives the reticulocyte its reticulated
appearance and name).[34]
***** Structure[edit] *****
Heme b group
Hemoglobin has a quaternary_structure characteristic of many multi-subunit
globular proteins.[35] Most of the amino acids in hemoglobin form alpha
helices, and these helices are connected by short non-helical segments.
Hydrogen bonds stabilize the helical sections inside this protein, causing
attractions within the molecule, which then causes each polypeptide chain to
fold into a specific shape.[36] Hemoglobin's quaternary structure comes from
its four subunits in roughly a tetrahedral arrangement.[35]
In most vertebrates, the hemoglobin molecule is an assembly of four globular
protein subunits. Each subunit is composed of a protein chain tightly
associated with a non-protein prosthetic heme group. Each protein chain
arranges into a set of alpha-helix structural segments connected together in a
globin_fold arrangement. Such a name is given because this arrangement is the
same folding motif used in other heme/globin proteins such as myoglobin.[37]
[38] This folding pattern contains a pocket that strongly binds the heme group.
A heme group consists of an iron (Fe) ion (charged atom) held in a heterocyclic
ring, known as a porphyrin. This porphyrin ring consists of four pyrrole
molecules cyclically linked together (by methine bridges) with the iron ion
bound in the center.[39] The iron ion, which is the site of oxygen binding,
coordinates with the four nitrogen atoms in the center of the ring, which all
lie in one plane. The iron is bound strongly (covalently) to the globular
protein via the N atoms of the imidazole ring of F8 histidine residue (also
known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position can
reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate_covalent_bond,[40] completing the
octahedral group of six ligands. Oxygen binds in an "end-on bent" geometry
where one oxygen atom binds to Fe and the other protrudes at an angle. When
oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site,
forming a distorted octahedron.
Even though carbon dioxide is carried by hemoglobin, it does not compete with
oxygen for the iron-binding positions but is bound to the protein chains of the
structure.
The iron ion may be either in the Fe2+ or in the Fe3+ state, but
ferrihemoglobin (methemoglobin) (Fe3+) cannot bind oxygen.[41] In binding,
oxygen temporarily and reversibly oxidizes (Fe2+) to (Fe3+) while oxygen
temporarily turns into the superoxide ion, thus iron must exist in the +2
oxidation state to bind oxygen. If superoxide ion associated to Fe3+ is
protonated, the hemoglobin iron will remain oxidized and incapable of binding
oxygen. In such cases, the enzyme methemoglobin_reductase will be able to
eventually reactivate methemoglobin by reducing the iron center.
In adult humans, the most common hemoglobin type is a tetramer (which contains
four subunit proteins) called hemoglobin A, consisting of two Î± and two Î²
subunits non-covalently bound, each made of 141 and 146 amino acid residues,
respectively. This is denoted as Î±2Î²2. The subunits are structurally similar
and about the same size. Each subunit has a molecular weight of about
16,000 daltons,[42] for a total molecular_weight of the tetramer of about
64,000 daltons (64,458 g/mol).[43] Thus, 1 g/dL = 0.1551 mmol/L. Hemoglobin A
is the most intensively studied of the hemoglobin molecules.
In human infants, the hemoglobin molecule is made up of 2 Î± chains and 2 Î³
chains. The gamma chains are gradually replaced by Î² chains as the infant
grows.[44]
The four polypeptide_chains are bound to each other by salt_bridges, hydrogen
bonds, and the hydrophobic_effect.
**** Oxygen saturation[edit] ****
In general, hemoglobin can be saturated with oxygen molecules (oxyhemoglobin),
or desaturated with oxygen molecules (deoxyhemoglobin).[45]
*** Oxyhemoglobin[edit] ***
Oxyhemoglobin is formed during physiological_respiration when oxygen binds to
the heme component of the protein hemoglobin in red blood cells. This process
occurs in the pulmonary_capillaries adjacent to the alveoli of the lungs. The
oxygen then travels through the blood stream to be dropped off at cells where
it is utilized as a terminal electron acceptor in the production of ATP by the
process of oxidative_phosphorylation. It does not, however, help to counteract
a decrease in blood pH. Ventilation, or breathing, may reverse this condition
by removal of carbon_dioxide, thus causing a shift up in pH.[46]
Hemoglobin exists in two forms, a taut (tense) form (T) and a relaxed form (R).
Various factors such as low pH, high CO2 and high 2,3_BPG at the level of the
tissues favor the taut form, which has low oxygen affinity and releases oxygen
in the tissues. Conversely, a high pH, low CO2, or low 2,3 BPG favors the
relaxed form, which can better bind oxygen.[47] The partial pressure of the
system also affects O2 affinity where, at high partial pressures of oxygen
(such as those present in the alveoli), the relaxed (high affinity, R) state is
favoured. Inversely, at low partial pressures (such as those present in
respiring tissues), the (low affinity, T) tense state is favoured.[48]
Additionally, the binding of oxygen to the iron(II) heme pulls the iron into
the plane of the porphyrin ring, causing a slight conformational shift. The
shift encourages oxygen to bind to the three remaining heme units within
hemoglobin (thus, oxygen binding is cooperative).
*** Deoxygenated hemoglobin[edit] ***
Deoxygenated hemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen. The
absorption_spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ. The
oxyhemoglobin has significantly lower absorption of the 660 nm wavelength than
deoxyhemoglobin, while at 940 nm its absorption is slightly higher. This
difference is used for the measurement of the amount of oxygen in a patient's
blood by an instrument called a pulse_oximeter. This difference also accounts
for the presentation of cyanosis, the blue to purplish color that tissues
develop during hypoxia.[49]
Deoxygenated hemoglobin is paramagnetic; it is weakly attracted to magnetic
fields.[50][51] In contrast, oxygenated hemoglobin exhibits diamagnetism, a
weak repulsion from a magnetic field.[51]
***** Evolution of vertebrate hemoglobin[edit] *****
Scientists agree that the event that separated myoglobin from hemoglobin
occurred after lampreys diverged from jawed_vertebrates.[52] This separation of
myoglobin and hemoglobin allowed for the different functions of the two
molecules to arise and develop: myoglobin has more to do with oxygen storage
while hemoglobin is tasked with oxygen transport.[53] The Î±- and Î²-like
globin genes encode the individual subunits of the protein.[24] The
predecessors of these genes arose through another duplication event also after
the gnathosome common ancestor derived from jawless fish, approximately
450â500 million years ago.[52] The development of Î± and Î² genes created the
potential for hemoglobin to be composed of multiple subunits, a physical
composition central to hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen. Having
multiple subunits contributes to hemoglobin's ability to bind oxygen
cooperatively as well as be regulated allosterically.[53] Subsequently, the Î±
gene also underwent a duplication event to form the HBA1 and HBA2 genes.[54]
These further duplications and divergences have created a diverse range of Î±-
and Î²-like globin genes that are regulated so that certain forms occur at
different stages of development.[53]
Most ice fish of the family Channichthyidae have lost their hemoglobin genes as
an adaptation to cold water.[5]
***** Iron's oxidation state in oxyhemoglobin[edit] *****
Assigning oxygenated hemoglobin's oxidation state is difficult because
oxyhemoglobin (Hb-O2), by experimental measurement, is diamagnetic (no net
unpaired electrons), yet the lowest-energy (ground-state) electron
configurations in both oxygen and iron are paramagnetic (suggesting at least
one unpaired electron in the complex). The lowest-energy form of oxygen, and
the lowest energy forms of the relevant oxidation states of iron, are these:
    * Triplet_oxygen, the lowest-energy molecular oxygen species, has two
      unpaired electrons in antibonding Ï* molecular orbitals.
    * Iron(II) tends to exist in a high-spin 3d6 configuration with four
      unpaired electrons.
    * Iron(III) (3d5) has an odd number of electrons, and thus must have one or
      more unpaired electrons, in any energy state.
All of these structures are paramagnetic (have unpaired electrons), not
diamagnetic. Thus, a non-intuitive (e.g., a higher-energy for at least one
species) distribution of electrons in the combination of iron and oxygen must
exist, in order to explain the observed diamagnetism and no unpaired electrons.
The two logical possibilities to produce diamagnetic (no net spin) Hb-O2 are:
   1. Low-spin Fe2+ binds to singlet_oxygen. Both low-spin iron and singlet
      oxygen are diamagnetic. However, the singlet form of oxygen is the
      higher-energy form of the molecule.
   2. Low-spin Fe3+ binds to O2â¢â (the superoxide ion) and the two unpaired
      electrons couple antiferromagnetically, giving observed diamagnetic
      properties. Here, the iron has been oxidized (has lost one electron), and
      the oxygen has been reduced (has gained one electron).
Another possible model in which low-spin Fe4+ binds to peroxide, O22â, can be
ruled out by itself, because the iron is paramagnetic (although the peroxide
ion is diamagnetic). Here, the iron has been oxidized by two electrons, and the
oxygen reduced by two electrons.
Direct experimental data:
    * X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy suggests iron has an oxidation state of
      approximately 3.2.
    * Infrared_vibrational_frequencies of the O-O bond suggests a bond length
      fitting with superoxide (a bond order of about 1.6, with superoxide being
      1.5).
    * X-ray_Absorption_Near_Edge_Structures at the iron K-edge. The energy
      shift of 5 eV between deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin, as for all the
      methemoglobin species, strongly suggests an actual local charge closer to
      Fe3+ than Fe2+.[55][56][57]
Thus, the nearest formal oxidation state of iron in Hb-O2 is the +3 state, with
oxygen in the â1 state (as superoxide .O2â). The diamagnetism in this
configuration arises from the single unpaired electron on superoxide aligning
antiferromagnetically with the single unpaired electron on iron (in a low-spin
d5 state), to give no net spin to the entire configuration, in accordance with
diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin from experiment.[58][59]
The second choice of the logical possibilities above for diamagnetic
oxyhemoglobin being found correct by experiment, is not surprising: singlet
oxygen (possibility #1) is an unrealistically high energy state. Model 3 leads
to unfavorable separation of charge (and does not agree with the magnetic
data), although it could make a minor contribution as a resonance form. Iron's
shift to a higher oxidation state in Hb-O2 decreases the atom's size, and
allows it into the plane of the porphyrin ring, pulling on the coordinated
histidine residue and initiating the allosteric changes seen in the globulins.
Early postulates by bio-inorganic chemists claimed that possibility #1 (above)
was correct and that iron should exist in oxidation state II. This conclusion
seemed likely, since the iron oxidation state III as methemoglobin, when not
accompanied by superoxide .O2â to "hold" the oxidation electron, was known to
render hemoglobin incapable of binding normal triplet O2 as it occurs in the
air. It was thus assumed that iron remained as Fe(II) when oxygen gas was bound
in the lungs. The iron chemistry in this previous classical model was elegant,
but the required presence of the diamagnetic, high-energy, singlet oxygen
molecule was never explained. It was classically argued that the binding of an
oxygen molecule placed high-spin iron(II) in an octahedral field of strong-
field ligands; this change in field would increase the crystal_field_splitting
energy, causing iron's electrons to pair into the low-spin configuration, which
would be diamagnetic in Fe(II). This forced low-spin pairing is indeed thought
to happen in iron when oxygen binds, but is not enough to explain iron's change
in size. Extraction of an additional electron from iron by oxygen is required
to explain both iron's smaller size and observed increased oxidation state, and
oxygen's weaker bond.
The assignment of a whole-number oxidation state is a formalism, as the
covalent bonds are not required to have perfect bond orders involving whole
electron transfer. Thus, all three models for paramagnetic Hb-O2 may contribute
to some small degree (by resonance) to the actual electronic configuration of
Hb-O2. However, the model of iron in Hb-O2 being Fe(III) is more correct than
the classical idea that it remains Fe(II).
***** Cooperativity[edit] *****
A schematic visual model of oxygen-binding process, showing all four monomers
and hemes, and protein_chains only as diagrammatic coils, to facilitate
visualization into the molecule. Oxygen is not shown in this model, but, for
each of the iron atoms, it binds to the iron (red sphere) in the flat heme. For
example, in the upper-left of the four hemes shown, oxygen binds at the left of
the iron atom shown in the upper-left of diagram. This causes the iron atom to
move backward into the heme that holds it (the iron moves upward as it binds
oxygen, in this illustration), tugging the histidine residue (modeled as a red
pentagon on the right of the iron) closer, as it does. This, in turn, pulls on
the protein chain holding the histidine.
When oxygen binds to the iron complex, it causes the iron atom to move back
toward the center of the plane of the porphyrin ring (see moving diagram). At
the same time, the imidazole side-chain of the histidine residue interacting at
the other pole of the iron is pulled toward the porphyrin ring. This
interaction forces the plane of the ring sideways toward the outside of the
tetramer, and also induces a strain in the protein helix containing the
histidine as it moves nearer to the iron atom. This strain is transmitted to
the remaining three monomers in the tetramer, where it induces a similar
conformational change in the other heme sites such that binding of oxygen to
these sites becomes easier.
As oxygen binds to one monomer of hemoglobin, the tetramer's conformation
shifts from the T (tense) state to the R (relaxed) state. This shift promotes
the binding of oxygen to the remaining three monomer's heme groups, thus
saturating the hemoglobin molecule with oxygen.[60]
In the tetrameric form of normal adult hemoglobin, the binding of oxygen is,
thus, a cooperative_process. The binding affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is
increased by the oxygen saturation of the molecule, with the first molecules of
oxygen bound influencing the shape of the binding sites for the next ones, in a
way favorable for binding. This positive cooperative binding is achieved
through steric conformational changes of the hemoglobin protein complex as
discussed above; i.e., when one subunit protein in hemoglobin becomes
oxygenated, a conformational or structural change in the whole complex is
initiated, causing the other subunits to gain an increased affinity for oxygen.
As a consequence, the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin is sigmoidal, or S-
shaped, as opposed to the normal hyperbolic curve associated with
noncooperative binding.
The dynamic mechanism of the cooperativity in hemoglobin and its relation with
the low-frequency_resonance has been discussed.[61]
***** Binding for ligands other than oxygen[edit] *****
Besides the oxygen ligand, which binds to hemoglobin in a cooperative manner,
hemoglobin ligands also include competitive_inhibitors such as carbon_monoxide
(CO) and allosteric_ligands such as carbon_dioxide (CO2) and nitric_oxide (NO).
The carbon dioxide is bound to amino groups of the globin proteins to form
carbaminohemoglobin; this mechanism is thought to account for about 10% of
carbon dioxide transport in mammals. Nitric_oxide can also be transported by
hemoglobin; it is bound to specific thiol groups in the globin protein to form
an S-nitrosothiol, which dissociates into free nitric oxide and thiol again, as
the hemoglobin releases oxygen from its heme site. This nitric oxide transport
to peripheral tissues is hypothesized to assist oxygen transport in tissues, by
releasing vasodilatory nitric oxide to tissues in which oxygen levels are low.
[62]
**** Competitive[edit] ****
The binding of oxygen is affected by molecules such as carbon monoxide (for
example, from tobacco_smoking, exhaust_gas, and incomplete combustion in
furnaces). CO competes with oxygen at the heme binding site. Hemoglobin's
binding affinity for CO is 250 times greater than its affinity for oxygen,[63]
[64] meaning that small amounts of CO dramatically reduce hemoglobin's ability
to deliver oxygen to the target tissue.[65] Since carbon monoxide is a
colorless, odorless and tasteless gas, and poses a potentially fatal threat,
carbon_monoxide_detectors have become commercially available to warn of
dangerous levels in residences. When hemoglobin combines with CO, it forms a
very bright red compound called carboxyhemoglobin, which may cause the skin of
CO_poisoning victims to appear pink in death, instead of white or blue. When
inspired air contains CO levels as low as 0.02%, headache and nausea occur; if
the CO concentration is increased to 0.1%, unconsciousness will follow. In
heavy smokers, up to 20% of the oxygen-active sites can be blocked by CO.
In similar fashion, hemoglobin also has competitive binding affinity for
cyanide (CNâ), sulfur_monoxide (SO), and sulfide (S2â), including hydrogen
sulfide (H2S). All of these bind to iron in heme without changing its oxidation
state, but they nevertheless inhibit oxygen-binding, causing grave toxicity.
The iron atom in the heme group must initially be in the ferrous (Fe2+)
oxidation state to support oxygen and other gases' binding and transport (it
temporarily switches to ferric during the time oxygen is bound, as explained
above). Initial oxidation to the ferric (Fe3+) state without oxygen converts
hemoglobin into "hemiglobin" or methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen.
Hemoglobin in normal red blood cells is protected by a reduction system to keep
this from happening. Nitric oxide is capable of converting a small fraction of
hemoglobin to methemoglobin in red blood cells. The latter reaction is a
remnant activity of the more ancient nitric_oxide_dioxygenase function of
globins.
**** Allosteric[edit] ****
Further information: Oxygen-hemoglobin_dissociation_curve
Carbon dioxide occupies a different binding site on the hemoglobin. Carbon
dioxide is more readily dissolved in deoxygenated blood, facilitating its
removal from the body after the oxygen has been released to tissues undergoing
metabolism. This increased affinity for carbon dioxide by the venous blood is
known as the Haldane_effect. Through the enzyme carbonic_anhydrase, carbon
dioxide reacts with water to give carbonic_acid, which decomposes into
bicarbonate and protons:
      CO2 + H2O â H2CO3 â HCO3â + H+
The sigmoidal shape of hemoglobin's oxygen-dissociation curve results from
cooperative binding of oxygen to hemoglobin.
Hence, blood with high carbon dioxide levels is also lower in pH (more acidic).
Hemoglobin can bind protons and carbon dioxide, which causes a conformational
change in the protein and facilitates the release of oxygen. Protons bind at
various places on the protein, while carbon dioxide binds at the Î±-amino
group.[66] Carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin and forms carbaminohemoglobin.
[67] This decrease in hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen by the binding of carbon
dioxide and acid is known as the Bohr_effect. The Bohr effect favors the T
state rather than the R state. (shifts the O2-saturation curve to the right).
Conversely, when the carbon dioxide levels in the blood decrease (i.e., in the
lung capillaries), carbon dioxide and protons are released from hemoglobin,
increasing the oxygen affinity of the protein. A reduction in the total binding
capacity of hemoglobin to oxygen (i.e. shifting the curve down, not just to the
right) due to reduced pH is called the root_effect. This is seen in bony fish.
It is necessary for hemoglobin to release the oxygen that it binds; if not,
there is no point in binding it. The sigmoidal curve of hemoglobin makes it
efficient in binding (taking up O2 in lungs), and efficient in unloading
(unloading O2 in tissues).[68]
In people acclimated to high altitudes, the concentration of 2,3-
Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) in the blood is increased, which allows these
individuals to deliver a larger amount of oxygen to tissues under conditions of
lower oxygen_tension. This phenomenon, where molecule Y affects the binding of
molecule X to a transport molecule Z, is called a heterotropic allosteric
effect. Hemoglobin in organisms at high altitudes has also adapted such that it
has less of an affinity for 2,3-BPG and so the protein will be shifted more
towards its R state. In its R state, hemoglobin will bind oxygen more readily,
thus allowing organisms to perform the necessary metabolic processes when
oxygen is present at low partial pressures.[69]
Animals other than humans use different molecules to bind to hemoglobin and
change its O2 affinity under unfavorable conditions. Fish use both ATP and GTP.
These bind to a phosphate "pocket" on the fish hemoglobin molecule, which
stabilizes the tense state and therefore decreases oxygen affinity.[70] GTP
reduces hemoglobin oxygen affinity much more than ATP, which is thought to be
due to an extra hydrogen_bond formed that further stabilizes the tense state.
[71] Under hypoxic conditions, the concentration of both ATP and GTP is reduced
in fish red blood cells to increase oxygen affinity.[72]
A variant hemoglobin, called fetal_hemoglobin (HbF, Î±2Î³2), is found in the
developing fetus, and binds oxygen with greater affinity than adult hemoglobin.
This means that the oxygen binding curve for fetal hemoglobin is left-shifted
(i.e., a higher percentage of hemoglobin has oxygen bound to it at lower oxygen
tension), in comparison to that of adult hemoglobin. As a result, fetal blood
in the placenta is able to take oxygen from maternal blood.
Hemoglobin also carries nitric_oxide (NO) in the globin part of the molecule.
This improves oxygen delivery in the periphery and contributes to the control
of respiration. NO binds reversibly to a specific cysteine residue in globin;
the binding depends on the state (R or T) of the hemoglobin. The resulting S-
nitrosylated hemoglobin influences various NO-related activities such as the
control of vascular resistance, blood pressure and respiration. NO is not
released in the cytoplasm of red blood cells but transported out of them by an
anion exchanger called AE1.[73]
***** Types in humans[edit] *****
Hemoglobin_variants are a part of the normal embryonic and fetal development.
They may also be pathologic mutant forms of hemoglobin in a population, caused
by variations in genetics. Some well-known hemoglobin variants, such as sickle-
cell_anemia, are responsible for diseases and are considered
hemoglobinopathies. Other variants cause no detectable pathology, and are thus
considered non-pathological variants.[74][75]
In the embryo:
    * Gower 1 (Î¶2Îµ2)
    * Gower 2 (Î±2Îµ2) (PDB: 1A9W​)
    * Hemoglobin Portland I (Î¶2Î³2)
    * Hemoglobin Portland II (Î¶2Î²2).
In the fetus:
    * Hemoglobin_F (Î±2Î³2) (PDB: 1FDH​).
After birth:
    * Hemoglobin_A (Î±2Î²2) (PDB: 1BZ0​) â The most common with a normal
      amount over 95%
    * Hemoglobin_A2 (Î±2Î´2) â Î´ chain synthesis begins late in the third
      trimester and, in adults, it has a normal range of 1.5â3.5%
    * Hemoglobin_F (Î±2Î³2) â In adults Hemoglobin F is restricted to a
      limited population of red cells called F-cells. However, the level of Hb
      F can be elevated in persons with sickle-cell disease and beta-
      thalassemia.

Variant forms that cause disease:
    * Hemoglobin_D-Punjab â (Î±2Î²D2) â A variant form of hemoglobin.
    * Hemoglobin H (Î²4) â A variant form of hemoglobin, formed by a tetramer

    * Hemoglobin_S (Î±2Î²S2) â A variant form of hemoglobin found in people
      with sickle cell disease. There is a variation in the Î²-chain gene,
      causing a change in the properties of hemoglobin, which results in
      sickling of red blood cells.
    * Hemoglobin_C (Î±2Î²C2) â Another variant due to a variation in the Î²-
      chain gene. This variant causes a mild chronic hemolytic_anemia.
    * Hemoglobin_E (Î±2Î²E2) â Another variant due to a variation in the Î²-
      chain gene. This variant causes a mild chronic hemolytic anemia.
    * Hemoglobin AS â A heterozygous form causing sickle_cell_trait with one
      adult gene and one sickle cell disease gene
    * Hemoglobin SC disease â A compound heterozygous form with one sickle
      gene and another encoding Hemoglobin_C.
    * Hemoglobin_Hopkins-2 - A variant form of hemoglobin that is sometimes
      viewed in combination with Hemoglobin_S to produce sickle cell disease.
***** Degradation in vertebrate animals[edit] *****
When red_blood_cells reach the end of their life due to aging or defects, they
are removed from the circulation by the phagocytic activity of macrophages in
the spleen or the liver or hemolyze within the circulation. Free_hemoglobin is
then cleared from the circulation via the hemoglobin transporter CD163, which
is exclusively expressed on monocytes or macrophages. Within these cells the
hemoglobin molecule is broken up, and the iron gets recycled. This process also
produces one molecule of carbon monoxide for every molecule of heme degraded.
[76] Heme degradation is one of the few natural sources of carbon monoxide in
the human body, and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon
monoxide even in people breathing pure air. The other major final product of
heme degradation is bilirubin. Increased levels of this chemical are detected
in the blood if red blood cells are being destroyed more rapidly than usual.
Improperly degraded hemoglobin protein or hemoglobin that has been released
from the blood cells too rapidly can clog small blood vessels, especially the
delicate blood filtering vessels of the kidneys, causing kidney damage. Iron is
removed from heme and salvaged for later use, it is stored as hemosiderin or
ferritin in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as
transferrins. When the porphyrin ring is broken up, the fragments are normally
secreted as a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which is secreted into the
intestines as bile. Intestines metabolise bilirubin into urobilinogen.
Urobilinogen leaves the body in faeces, in a pigment called stercobilin.
Globulin is metabolised into amino acids that are then released into
circulation.
***** Role in disease[edit] *****
Hemoglobin deficiency can be caused either by a decreased amount of hemoglobin
molecules, as in anemia, or by decreased ability of each molecule to bind
oxygen at the same partial pressure of oxygen. Hemoglobinopathies (genetic
defects resulting in abnormal structure of the hemoglobin molecule)[77] may
cause both. In any case, hemoglobin deficiency decreases blood_oxygen-carrying
capacity. Hemoglobin deficiency is, in general, strictly distinguished from
hypoxemia, defined as decreased partial_pressure of oxygen in blood,[78][79]
[80][81] although both are causes of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen supply to
tissues).
Other common causes of low hemoglobin include loss of blood, nutritional
deficiency, bone marrow problems, chemotherapy, kidney failure, or abnormal
hemoglobin (such as that of sickle-cell disease).
The ability of each hemoglobin molecule to carry oxygen is normally modified by
altered blood pH or CO2, causing an altered oxygenâhemoglobin_dissociation
curve. However, it can also be pathologically altered in, e.g., carbon_monoxide
poisoning.
Decrease of hemoglobin, with or without an absolute decrease of red blood
cells, leads to symptoms of anemia. Anemia has many different causes, although
iron_deficiency and its resultant iron_deficiency_anemia are the most common
causes in the Western world. As absence of iron decreases heme synthesis, red
blood cells in iron deficiency anemia are hypochromic (lacking the red
hemoglobin pigment) and microcytic (smaller than normal). Other anemias are
rarer. In hemolysis (accelerated breakdown of red blood cells), associated
jaundice is caused by the hemoglobin metabolite bilirubin, and the circulating
hemoglobin can cause renal_failure.
Some mutations in the globin chain are associated with the hemoglobinopathies,
such as sickle-cell disease and thalassemia. Other mutations, as discussed at
the beginning of the article, are benign and are referred to merely as
hemoglobin_variants.
There is a group of genetic disorders, known as the porphyrias that are
characterized by errors in metabolic pathways of heme synthesis. King George
III_of_the_United_Kingdom was probably the most famous porphyria sufferer.
To a small extent, hemoglobin A slowly combines with glucose at the terminal
valine (an alpha aminoacid) of each Î² chain. The resulting molecule is often
referred to as Hb_A1c, a glycosylated_hemoglobin. The binding of glucose to
amino acids in the hemoglobin takes place spontaneously (without the help of an
enzyme) in many proteins, and is not known to serve a useful purpose. However,
as the concentration of glucose in the blood increases, the percentage of Hb A
that turns into Hb A1c increases. In diabetics whose glucose usually runs high,
the percent Hb A1c also runs high. Because of the slow rate of Hb A combination
with glucose, the Hb A1c percentage reflects a weighted average of blood
glucose levels over the lifetime of red cells, which is approximately 120 days.
[82] The levels of glycosylated hemoglobin are therefore measured in order to
monitor the long-term control of the chronic disease of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM). Poor control of T2DM results in high levels of glycosylated
hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The normal reference range is approximately
4.0â5.9%. Though difficult to obtain, values less than 7% are recommended for
people with T2DM. Levels greater than 9% are associated with poor control of
the glycosylated hemoglobin, and levels greater than 12% are associated with
very poor control. Diabetics who keep their glycosylated hemoglobin levels
close to 7% have a much better chance of avoiding the complications that may
accompany diabetes (than those whose levels are 8% or higher).[83] In addition,
increased glycosylation of hemoglobin increases its affinity for oxygen,
therefore preventing its release at the tissue and inducing a level of hypoxia
in extreme cases.[84]
Elevated levels of hemoglobin are associated with increased numbers or sizes of
red blood cells, called polycythemia. This elevation may be caused by
congenital_heart_disease, cor_pulmonale, pulmonary_fibrosis, too much
erythropoietin, or polycythemia_vera.[85] High hemoglobin levels may also be
caused by exposure to high altitudes, smoking, dehydration (artificially by
concentrating Hb), advanced lung disease and certain tumors.[44]
A recent study done in Pondicherry, India, shows its importance in coronary
artery disease.[86]
***** Diagnostic uses[edit] *****
Main article: Hemoglobinometer
A hemoglobin concentration measurement being administered before a blood
donation at the American_Red_Cross Boston Blood Donation Center.
Hemoglobin concentration measurement is among the most commonly performed blood
tests, usually as part of a complete_blood_count. For example, it is typically
tested before or after blood_donation. Results are reported in g/L, g/dL or
mol/L. 1 g/dL equals about 0.6206 mmol/L, although the latter units are not
used as often due to uncertainty regarding the polymeric state of the molecule.
[87] This conversion factor, using the single globin unit molecular weight of
16,000 Da, is more common for hemoglobin concentration in blood. For MCHC (mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) the conversion factor 0.155, which uses
the tetramer weight of 64,500 Da, is more common.[88] Normal levels are:
    * Men: 13.8 to 18.0 g/dL (138 to 180 g/L, or 8.56 to 11.17 mmol/L)
    * Women: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL (121 to 151 g/L, or 7.51 to 9.37 mmol/L)
    * Children: 11 to 16 g/dL (110 to 160 g/L, or 6.83 to 9.93 mmol/L)
    * Pregnant women: 11 to 14 g/dL (110 to 140 g/L, or 6.83 to 8.69 mmol/L)
      (9.5 to 15 usual value during pregnancy)[89][90]
Normal values of hemoglobin in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnant women
must be at least 11 g/dL and at least 10.5 g/dL during the 2nd trimester.[91]
Dehydration or hyperhydration can greatly influence measured hemoglobin levels.
Albumin can indicate hydration status.
If the concentration is below normal, this is called anemia. Anemias are
classified by the size of red blood cells, the cells that contain hemoglobin in
vertebrates. The anemia is called "microcytic" if red cells are small,
"macrocytic" if they are large, and "normocytic" otherwise.
Hematocrit, the proportion of blood volume occupied by red blood cells, is
typically about three times the hemoglobin concentration measured in g/dL. For
example, if the hemoglobin is measured at 17 g/dL, that compares with a
hematocrit of 51%.[92]
Laboratory hemoglobin test methods require a blood sample (arterial, venous, or
capillary) and analysis on hematology analyzer and CO-oximeter. Additionally, a
new noninvasive hemoglobin (SpHb) test method called Pulse CO-Oximetry is also
available with comparable accuracy to invasive methods.[93]
Concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin can be measured continuously,
regionally and noninvasively using NIRS.[94][95][96][97][98] NIRS can be used
both on the head and on muscles. This technique is often used for research in
e.g. elite sports training, ergonomics, rehabilitation, patient monitoring,
neonatal research, functional brain monitoring, brain computer interface,
urology (bladder contraction), neurology (Neurovascular coupling) and more.
Long-term control of blood_sugar concentration can be measured by the
concentration of Hb A1c. Measuring it directly would require many samples
because blood sugar levels vary widely through the day. Hb A1c is the product
of the irreversible_reaction of hemoglobin A with glucose. A higher glucose
concentration results in more Hb A1c. Because the reaction is slow, the Hb A1c
proportion represents glucose level in blood averaged over the half-life of red
blood cells, is typically 50â55 days. An Hb A1c proportion of 6.0% or less
show good long-term glucose control, while values above 7.0% are elevated. This
test is especially useful for diabetics.[99]
The functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging (fMRI) machine uses the signal from
deoxyhemoglobin, which is sensitive to magnetic fields since it is
paramagnetic. Combined measurement with NIRS shows good correlation with both
the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin signal compared to the BOLD_signal.[100]
***** Athletic tracking and self tracking uses[edit] *****
Hemoglobin can be tracked noninvasively, to build an individual data set
tracking the hemoconcentration and hemodilution effects of daily activities for
better understanding of sports performance and training. Athletes are often
concerned about endurance and intensity of exercise. The sensor uses light-
emitting diodes that emit red and infrared light through the tissue to a light
detector, which then sends a signal to a processor to calculate the absorption
of light by the hemoglobin protein.[101] This sensor is similar to a pulse
oximeter, which consists of a small sensing device that clips to the finger.
***** Analogues in non-vertebrate organisms[edit] *****
A variety of oxygen-transport and -binding proteins exist in organisms
throughout the animal and plant kingdoms. Organisms including bacteria,
protozoans, and fungi all have hemoglobin-like proteins whose known and
predicted roles include the reversible binding of gaseous ligands. Since many
of these proteins contain globins and the heme moiety (iron in a flat porphyrin
support), they are often called hemoglobins, even if their overall tertiary
structure is very different from that of vertebrate hemoglobin. In particular,
the distinction of "myoglobin" and hemoglobin in lower animals is often
impossible, because some of these organisms do not contain muscles. Or, they
may have a recognizable separate circulatory_system but not one that deals with
oxygen transport (for example, many insects and other arthropods). In all these
groups, heme/globin-containing molecules (even monomeric globin ones) that deal
with gas-binding are referred to as oxyhemoglobins. In addition to dealing with
transport and sensing of oxygen, they may also deal with NO, CO2, sulfide
compounds, and even O2 scavenging in environments that must be anaerobic.[102]
They may even deal with detoxification of chlorinated materials in a way
analogous to heme-containing P450 enzymes and peroxidases.
The giant tube worm Riftia_pachyptila showing red hemoglobin-containing plumes
The structure of hemoglobins varies across species. Hemoglobin occurs in all
kingdoms of organisms, but not in all organisms. Primitive species such as
bacteria, protozoa, algae, and plants often have single-globin hemoglobins.
Many nematode worms, molluscs, and crustaceans contain very large multisubunit
molecules, much larger than those in vertebrates. In particular, chimeric
hemoglobins found in fungi and giant annelids may contain both globin and other
types of proteins.[14]
One of the most striking occurrences and uses of hemoglobin in organisms is in
the giant_tube_worm (Riftia pachyptila, also called Vestimentifera), which can
reach 2.4 meters length and populates ocean volcanic_vents. Instead of a
digestive_tract, these worms contain a population of bacteria constituting half
the organism's weight. The bacteria oxidize H2S from the vent with O2 from the
water to produce energy to make food from H2O and CO2. The worms' upper end is
a deep-red fan-like structure ("plume"), which extends into the water and
absorbs H2S and O2 for the bacteria, and CO2 for use as synthetic raw material
similar to photosynthetic plants. The structures are bright red due to their
content of several extraordinarily complex hemoglobins that have up to 144
globin chains, each including associated heme structures. These hemoglobins are
remarkable for being able to carry oxygen in the presence of sulfide, and even
to carry sulfide, without being completely "poisoned" or inhibited by it as
hemoglobins in most other species are.[103][104]
***** Other oxygen-binding proteins[edit] *****
  Myoglobin
      Found in the muscle tissue of many vertebrates, including humans, it
      gives muscle tissue a distinct red or dark gray color. It is very similar
      to hemoglobin in structure and sequence, but is not a tetramer; instead,
      it is a monomer that lacks cooperative binding. It is used to store
      oxygen rather than transport it.
  Hemocyanin
      The second most common oxygen-transporting protein found in nature, it is
      found in the blood of many arthropods and molluscs. Uses copper
      prosthetic groups instead of iron heme groups and is blue in color when
      oxygenated.
  Hemerythrin
      Some marine invertebrates and a few species of annelid use this iron-
      containing non-heme protein to carry oxygen in their blood. Appears pink/
      violet when oxygenated, clear when not.
  Chlorocruorin
      Found in many annelids, it is very similar to erythrocruorin, but the
      heme group is significantly different in structure. Appears green when
      deoxygenated and red when oxygenated.
  Vanabins
      Also known as vanadium chromagens, they are found in the blood of sea
      squirts. They were once hypothesized to use the rare metal vanadium as an
      oxygen binding prosthetic group. However, although they do contain
      vanadium by preference, they apparently bind little oxygen, and thus have
      some other function, which has not been elucidated (sea squirts also
      contain some hemoglobin). They may act as toxins.
  Erythrocruorin
      Found in many annelids, including earthworms, it is a giant free-floating
      blood protein containing many dozensâpossibly hundredsâof iron- and
      heme-bearing protein subunits bound together into a single protein
      complex with a molecular mass greater than 3.5 million daltons.
  Pinnaglobin
      Only seen in the mollusc Pinna_nobilis. Brown manganese-based porphyrin
      protein.
  Leghemoglobin
      In leguminous plants, such as alfalfa or soybeans, the nitrogen fixing
      bacteria in the roots are protected from oxygen by this iron heme
      containing oxygen-binding protein. The specific enzyme protected is
      nitrogenase, which is unable to reduce nitrogen gas in the presence of
      free oxygen.
  Coboglobin
      A synthetic cobalt-based porphyrin. Coboprotein would appear colorless
      when oxygenated, but yellow when in veins.
***** Presence in nonerythroid cells[edit] *****
Some nonerythroid cells (i.e., cells other than the red blood cell line)
contain hemoglobin. In the brain, these include the A9 dopaminergic neurons in
the substantia_nigra, astrocytes in the cerebral_cortex and hippocampus, and in
all mature oligodendrocytes.[12] It has been suggested that brain hemoglobin in
these cells may enable the "storage of oxygen to provide a homeostatic
mechanism in anoxic conditions, which is especially important for A9 DA neurons
that have an elevated metabolism with a high requirement for energy
production".[12] It has been noted further that "A9 dopaminergic neurons may be
at particular risk since in addition to their high mitochondrial activity they
are under intense oxidative stress caused by the production of hydrogen
peroxide via autoxidation and/or monoamine oxidase (MAO)-mediated deamination
of dopamine and the subsequent reaction of accessible ferrous iron to generate
highly toxic hydroxyl radicals".[12] This may explain the risk of these cells
for degeneration in Parkinson's_disease.[12] The hemoglobin-derived iron in
these cells is not the cause of the post-mortem darkness of these cells (origin
of the Latin name, substantia nigra), but rather is due to neuromelanin.
Outside the brain, hemoglobin has non-oxygen-carrying functions as an
antioxidant and a regulator of iron_metabolism in macrophages,[105] alveolar
cells,[106] and mesangial_cells in the kidney.[107]
***** In history, art and music[edit] *****
Heart of Steel (Hemoglobin) (2005) by Julian_Voss-Andreae. The images show the
5-foot (1.60 m) tall sculpture right after installation, after 10 days, and
after several months of exposure to the elements.
Historically, an association between the color of blood and rust occurs in the
association of the planet Mars, with the Roman god of war, since the planet is
an orange-red, which reminded the ancients of blood. Although the color of the
planet is due to iron compounds in combination with oxygen in the Martian soil,
it is a common misconception that the iron in hemoglobin and its oxides gives
blood its red color. The color is actually due to the porphyrin moiety of
hemoglobin to which the iron is bound, not the iron itself,[108] although the
ligation and redox state of the iron can influence the pi to pi* or n to pi*
electronic transitions of the porphyrin and hence its optical characteristics.
Artist Julian_Voss-Andreae created a sculpture called "Heart of Steel
(Hemoglobin)" in 2005, based on the protein's backbone. The sculpture was made
from glass and weathering_steel. The intentional rusting of the initially shiny
work of art mirrors hemoglobin's fundamental chemical reaction of oxygen
binding to iron.[109][110]
Montreal artist Nicolas Baier created Lustre (HÃ©moglobine), a sculpture in
stainless steel that shows the structure of the hemoglobin molecule. It is
displayed in the atrium of McGill_University_Health_Centre's research centre in
Montreal. The sculpture measures about 10 metres Ã 10 metres Ã 10 metres.

 104. ^ This Hb A1c level is only useful in individuals who have red blood
      cells (RBCs) with normal survivals (i.e., normal half-life). In
      individuals with abnormal RBCs, whether due to abnormal hemoglobin
      molecules (such as Hemoglobin S in Sickle Cell Anemia) or RBC membrane
      defects â or other problems, the RBC half-life is frequently shortened.
      In these individuals, an alternative test called "fructosamine level" can
      be used. It measures the degree of glycation (glucose binding) to
      albumin, the most common blood protein, and reflects average blood
      glucose levels over the previous 18â21 days, which is the half-life of
      albumin molecules in the circulation.
