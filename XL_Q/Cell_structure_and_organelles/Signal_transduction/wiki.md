This article is about signaling at the cellular level. For systemic signal
transduction, see Transduction_(physiology).
Simplified representation of major signal transduction pathways in mammals.
Signal transduction is the process by which a chemical or physical signal is
transmitted through a cell as a series_of_molecular_events, most commonly
protein_phosphorylation catalyzed by protein_kinases, which ultimately results
in a cellular response. Proteins responsible for detecting stimuli are
generally termed receptors, although in some cases the term sensor is used.[1]
The changes elicited by ligand binding (or signal sensing) in a receptor give
rise to a biochemical_cascade, which is a chain of biochemical events as a
signaling_pathway.
When signaling pathways interact with one another they form networks, which
allow cellular responses to be coordinated, often by combinatorial signaling
events.[2] At the molecular level, such responses include changes in the
transcription or translation of genes, and post-translational and
conformational changes in proteins, as well as changes in their location. These
molecular events are the basic mechanisms controlling cell_growth,
proliferation, metabolism and many other processes.[3] In multicellular
organisms, signal transduction pathways have evolved to regulate cell
communication in a wide variety of ways.
Each component (or node) of a signaling pathway is classified according to the
role it plays with respect to the initial stimulus. Ligands are termed first
messengers, while receptors are the signal transducers, which then activate
primary effectors. Such effectors are often linked to second_messengers, which
can activate secondary effectors, and so on. Depending on the efficiency of the
nodes, a signal can be amplified (a concept known as signal gain), so that one
signaling molecule can generate a response involving hundreds to millions of
molecules.[4] As with other signals, the transduction of biological signals is
characterised by delay, noise, signal feedback and feedforward and
interference, which can range from negligible to pathological.[5] With the
advent of computational_biology, the analysis of signaling pathways and
networks has become an essential tool to understand cellular functions and
disease, including signaling rewiring mechanisms underlying responses to
acquired drug resistance.[6]

***** Stimuli[edit] *****
Main article: Stimulus_(physiology)
3D Medical animation still showing signal transduction.
The basis for signal transduction is the transformation of a certain stimulus
into a biochemical signal. The nature of such stimuli can vary widely, ranging
from extracellular cues, such as the presence of EGF, to intracellular events,
such as the DNA damage resulting from replicative telomere attrition.[7]
Traditionally, signals that reach the central nervous system are classified as
senses. These are transmitted from neuron to neuron in a process called
synaptic_transmission. Many other intercellular signal relay mechanisms exist
in multicellular organisms, such as those that govern embryonic development.[8]
**** Ligands[edit] ****
Main article: Ligand_(biochemistry)
The majority of signal transduction pathways involve the binding of signaling
molecules, known as ligands, to receptors that trigger events inside the cell.
The binding of a signaling molecule with a receptor causes a change in the
conformation of the receptor, known as receptor activation. Most ligands are
soluble molecules from the extracellular medium which bind to cell_surface
receptors. These include growth_factors, cytokines and neurotransmitters.
Components of the extracellular_matrix such as fibronectin and hyaluronan can
also bind to such receptors (integrins and CD44, respectively). In addition,
some molecules such as steroid_hormones are lipid-soluble and thus cross the
plasma membrane to reach nuclear_receptors.[9] In the case of steroid_hormone
receptors, their stimulation leads to binding to the promoter_region of
steroid-responsive genes.[10]
Not all classifications of signaling molecules take into account the molecular
nature of each class member. For example, odorants belong to a wide range of
molecular classes,[11] as do neurotransmitters, which range in size from small
molecules such as dopamine[12] to neuropeptides such as endorphins.[13]
Moreover, some molecules may fit into more than one class, e.g. epinephrine is
a neurotransmitter when secreted by the central_nervous_system and a hormone
when secreted by the adrenal_medulla.
Some receptors such as HER2 are capable of ligand-independent activation when
overexpressed or mutated. This leads to constituitive activation of the
pathway, which may or may not be overturned by compensation mechanisms. In the
case of HER2, which acts as a dimerization partner of other EGFRs,
constituitive activation leads to hyperproliferation and cancer.[14]
**** Mechanical forces[edit] ****
Main article: Mechanotransduction
The prevalence of basement_membranes in the tissues of Eumetazoans means that
most cell types require attachment to survive. This requirement has led to the
development of complex mechanotransduction pathways, allowing cells to sense
the stiffness of the substratum. Such signaling is mainly orchestrated in focal
adhesions, regions where the integrin-bound actin cytoskeleton detects changes
and transmits them downstream through YAP1.[15] Calcium-dependent cell_adhesion
molecules such as cadherins and selectins can also mediate mechanotransduction.
[16] Specialised forms of mechanotransduction within the nervous system are
responsible for mechanosensation: hearing, touch, proprioception and balance.
[17]
**** Osmolarity[edit] ****
Main article: Osmoreceptor
Cellular and systemic control of osmotic_pressure (the difference in osmolarity
between the cytosol and the extracellular medium) is critical for homeostasis.
There are three ways in which cells can detect osmotic stimuli: as changes in
macromolecular crowding, ionic strength, and changes in the properties of the
plasma membrane or cytoskeleton (the latter being a form of
mechanotransduction).[18] These changes are detected by proteins known as
osmosensors or osmoreceptors. In humans, the best characterised osmosensors are
transient_receptor_potential_channels present in the primary_cilium of human
cells.[18][19] In yeast, the HOG pathway has been extensively characterised.
[20]
**** Temperature[edit] ****
Main article: Thermoception
The sensing of temperature in cells is known as thermoception and is primarily
mediated by transient_receptor_potential_channels.[21] Additionally, animal
cells contain a conserved mechanism to prevent high temperatures from causing
cellular damage, the heat-shock_response. Such response is triggered when high
temperatures cause the dissociation of inactive HSF1 from complexes with heat
shock_proteins Hsp40/Hsp70 and Hsp90. With help from the ncRNA hsr1, HSF1 then
trimerizes, becoming active and upregulating the expression of its target
genes.[22] Many other thermosensory mechanisms exist in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes.[21]
**** Light[edit] ****
Main article: Visual_phototransduction
In mammals, light controls the sense of sight and the circadian_clock by
activating light-sensitive proteins in photoreceptor_cells in the eye's retina.
In the case of vision, light is detected by rhodopsin in rod and cone_cells.
[23] In the case of the circadian clock, a different photopigment, melanopsin,
is responsible for detecting light in intrinsically_photosensitive_retinal
ganglion_cells.[24]
***** Receptors[edit] *****
Receptors can be roughly divided into two major classes: intracellular and
extracellular receptors.
**** Extracellular receptors[edit] ****
Extracellular receptors are integral_transmembrane_proteins and make up most
receptors. They span the plasma_membrane of the cell, with one part of the
receptor on the outside of the cell and the other on the inside. Signal
transduction occurs as a result of a ligand binding to the outside region of
the receptor (the ligand does not pass through the membrane). Ligand-receptor
binding induces a change in the conformation of the inside part of the
receptor, a process sometimes called "receptor activation".[25] This results in
either the activation of an enzyme domain of the receptor or the exposure of a
binding site for other intracellular signaling proteins within the cell,
eventually propagating the signal through the cytoplasm.
In eukaryotic cells, most intracellular proteins activated by a ligand/receptor
interaction possess an enzymatic activity; examples include tyrosine_kinase and
phosphatases. Often such enzymes are covalently linked to the receptor. Some of
them create second_messengers such as cyclic_AMP and IP3, the latter
controlling the release of intracellular calcium stores into the cytoplasm.
Other activated proteins interact with adaptor_proteins that facilitate
signaling protein interactions and coordination of signaling complexes
necessary to respond to a particular stimulus. Enzymes and adaptor proteins are
both responsive to various second messenger molecules.
Many adaptor proteins and enzymes activated as part of signal transduction
possess specialized protein_domains that bind to specific secondary messenger
molecules. For example, calcium ions bind to the EF_hand domains of calmodulin,
allowing it to bind and activate calmodulin-dependent_kinase. PIP3 and other
phosphoinositides do the same thing to the Pleckstrin_homology_domains of
proteins such as the kinase protein AKT.
*** G proteinâcoupled receptors[edit] ***
Main article: G_proteinâcoupled_receptor
G proteinâcoupled receptors (GPCRs) are a family of integral transmembrane
proteins that possess seven transmembrane domains and are linked to a
heterotrimeric G_protein. With nearly 800 members, this is the largest family
of membrane proteins and receptors in mammals. Counting all animal species,
they add up to over 5000.[26] Mammalian GPCRs are classified into 5 major
families: rhodopsin-like, secretin-like, metabotropic_glutamate, adhesion and
frizzled/smoothened, with a few GPCR groups being difficult to classify due to
low sequence similarity, e.g. vomeronasal_receptors.[26] Other classes exist in
eukaryotes, such as the Dictyostelium cyclic_AMP_receptors and fungal_mating
pheromone_receptors.[26]
Signal transduction by a GPCR begins with an inactive G protein coupled to the
receptor; the G protein exists as a heterotrimer consisting of GÎ±, GÎ², and
GÎ³ subunits.[27] Once the GPCR recognizes a ligand, the conformation of the
receptor changes to activate the G protein, causing GÎ± to bind a molecule of
GTP and dissociate from the other two G-protein subunits. The dissociation
exposes sites on the subunits that can interact with other molecules.[28] The
activated G protein subunits detach from the receptor and initiate signaling
from many downstream effector proteins such as phospholipases and ion_channels,
the latter permitting the release of second messenger molecules.[29] The total
strength of signal amplification by a GPCR is determined by the lifetimes of
the ligand-receptor complex and receptor-effector protein complex and the
deactivation time of the activated receptor and effectors through intrinsic
enzymatic activity; e.g. via protein kinase phosphorylation or b-arrestin-
dependent internalization.
A study was conducted where a point_mutation was inserted into the gene
encoding the chemokine receptor CXCR2; mutated cells underwent a malignant
transformation due to the expression of CXCR2 in an active conformation despite
the absence of chemokine-binding. This meant that chemokine receptors can
contribute to cancer development.[30]
*** Tyrosine, Ser/Thr and Histidine-specific protein kinases[edit] ***
Receptor_tyrosine_kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins with an
intracellular kinase domain and an extracellular domain that binds ligands;
examples include growth_factor receptors such as the insulin_receptor.[31] To
perform signal transduction, RTKs need to form dimers in the plasma_membrane;
[32] the dimer is stabilized by ligands binding to the receptor. The
interaction between the cytoplasmic domains stimulates the autophosphorylation
of tyrosine residues within the intracellular kinase domains of the RTKs,
causing conformational changes. Subsequent to this, the receptors' kinase
domains are activated, initiating phosphorylation signaling cascades of
downstream cytoplasmic molecules that facilitate various cellular processes
such as cell_differentiation and metabolism.[31] Many Ser/Thr and dual-
specificity protein_kinases are important for signal transduction, either
acting downstream of [receptor tyrosine kinases], or as membrane-embedded or
cell-soluble versions in their own right. The process of signal transduction
involves around 560 known protein_kinases and pseudokinases, encoded by the
human kinome [33][34]
As is the case with GPCRs, proteins that bind GTP play a major role in signal
transduction from the activated RTK into the cell. In this case, the G proteins
are members of the Ras, Rho, and Raf families, referred to collectively as
small_G_proteins. They act as molecular switches usually tethered to membranes
by isoprenyl groups linked to their carboxyl ends. Upon activation, they assign
proteins to specific membrane subdomains where they participate in signaling.
Activated RTKs in turn activate small G proteins that activate guanine
nucleotide_exchange_factors such as SOS1. Once activated, these exchange
factors can activate more small G proteins, thus amplifying the receptor's
initial signal. The mutation of certain RTK genes, as with that of GPCRs, can
result in the expression of receptors that exist in a constitutively activated
state; such mutated genes may act as oncogenes.[35]
Histidine-specific_protein_kinases are structurally distinct from other protein
kinases and are found in prokaryotes, fungi, and plants as part of a two-
component signal transduction mechanism: a phosphate group from ATP is first
added to a histidine residue within the kinase, then transferred to an
aspartate residue on a receiver domain on a different protein or the kinase
itself, thus activating the aspartate residue.[36]
*** Integrins[edit] ***
Main article: Integrin
An overview of integrin-mediated signal transduction, adapted from Hehlgens et
al. (2007).[37]
Integrins are produced by a wide variety of cells; they play a role in cell
attachment to other cells and the extracellular_matrix and in the transduction
of signals from extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and
collagen. Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of integrins changes the
protein's conformation, clustering it at the cell membrane to initiate signal
transduction. Integrins lack kinase activity; hence, integrin-mediated signal
transduction is achieved through a variety of intracellular protein kinases and
adaptor molecules, the main coordinator being integrin-linked_kinase.[37] As
shown in the adjacent picture, cooperative integrin-RTK signaling determines
the timing of cellular survival, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation.
Important differences exist between integrin-signaling in circulating blood
cells and non-circulating cells such as epithelial_cells; integrins of
circulating cells are normally inactive. For example, cell membrane integrins
on circulating leukocytes are maintained in an inactive state to avoid
epithelial cell attachment; they are activated only in response to stimuli such
as those received at the site of an inflammatory_response. In a similar manner,
integrins at the cell membrane of circulating platelets are normally kept
inactive to avoid thrombosis. Epithelial cells (which are non-circulating)
normally have active integrins at their cell membrane, helping maintain their
stable adhesion to underlying stromal cells that provide signals to maintain
normal functioning.[38]
In plants, there are no bona fide integrin receptors identified to date;
nevertheless, several integrin-like proteins were proposed based on structural
homology with the metazoan receptors.[39] Plants contain integrin-linked
kinases that are very similar in their primary structure with the animal ILKs.
In the experimental model plant Arabidopsis_thaliana, one of the integrin-
linked kinase genes, ILK1, has been shown to be a critical element in the plant
immune response to signal molecules from bacterial pathogens and plant
sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress.[40] ILK1 protein interacts with the
high-affinity potassium transporter HAK5 and with the calcium sensor CML9.[40]
[41]
*** Toll-like receptors[edit] ***
Main article: Toll-like_receptor
When activated, toll-like receptors (TLRs) take adapter molecules within the
cytoplasm of cells in order to propagate a signal. Four adaptor molecules are
known to be involved in signaling, which are Myd88, TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM.[42]
[43][44] These adapters activate other intracellular molecules such as IRAK1,
IRAK4, TBK1, and IKKi that amplify the signal, eventually leading to the
induction or suppression of genes that cause certain responses. Thousands of
genes are activated by TLR signaling, implying that this method constitutes an
important gateway for gene modulation.
*** Ligand-gated ion channels[edit] ***
Main article: Ligand-gated_ion_channel
A ligand-gated ion channel, upon binding with a ligand, changes conformation to
open a channel in the cell membrane through which ions relaying signals can
pass. An example of this mechanism is found in the receiving cell of a neural
synapse. The influx of ions that occurs in response to the opening of these
channels induces action_potentials, such as those that travel along nerves, by
depolarizing the membrane of post-synaptic cells, resulting in the opening of
voltage-gated ion channels.
An example of an ion allowed into the cell during a ligand-gated ion channel
opening is Ca2+; it acts as a second messenger initiating signal transduction
cascades and altering the physiology of the responding cell. This results in
amplification of the synapse response between synaptic cells by remodelling the
dendritic_spines involved in the synapse.
**** Intracellular receptors[edit] ****
Main article: Intracellular_receptor
Intracellular receptors, such as nuclear_receptors and cytoplasmic_receptors,
are soluble proteins localized within their respective areas. The typical
ligands for nuclear receptors are non-polar hormones like the steroid hormones
testosterone and progesterone and derivatives of vitamins A and D. To initiate
signal transduction, the ligand must pass through the plasma membrane by
passive diffusion. On binding with the receptor, the ligands pass through the
nuclear_membrane into the nucleus, altering gene expression.
Activated nuclear receptors attach to the DNA at receptor-specific hormone-
responsive_element (HRE) sequences, located in the promoter region of the genes
activated by the hormone-receptor complex. Due to their enabling gene
transcription, they are alternatively called inductors of gene_expression. All
hormones that act by regulation of gene expression have two consequences in
their mechanism of action; their effects are produced after a
characteristically long period of time and their effects persist for another
long period of time, even after their concentration has been reduced to zero,
due to a relatively slow turnover of most enzymes and proteins that would
either deactivate or terminate ligand binding onto the receptor.
Nucleic receptors have DNA-binding domains containing zinc_fingers and a
ligand-binding domain; the zinc fingers stabilize DNA binding by holding its
phosphate backbone. DNA sequences that match the receptor are usually hexameric
repeats of any kind; the sequences are similar but their orientation and
distance differentiate them. The ligand-binding domain is additionally
responsible for dimerization of nucleic receptors prior to binding and
providing structures for transactivation used for communication with the
translational apparatus.
Steroid_receptors are a subclass of nuclear receptors located primarily within
the cytosol. In the absence of steroids, they associate in an aporeceptor
complex containing chaperone or heatshock_proteins (HSPs). The HSPs are
necessary to activate the receptor by assisting the protein to fold in a way
such that the signal_sequence enabling its passage into the nucleus is
accessible. Steroid receptors, on the other hand, may be repressive on gene
expression when their transactivation domain is hidden. Receptor activity can
be enhanced by phosphorylation of serine residues at their N-terminal as a
result of another signal transduction pathway, a process called crosstalk.
Retinoic_acid_receptors are another subset of nuclear receptors. They can be
activated by an endocrine-synthesized ligand that entered the cell by
diffusion, a ligand synthesised from a precursor like retinol brought to the
cell through the bloodstream or a completely intracellularly synthesised ligand
like prostaglandin. These receptors are located in the nucleus and are not
accompanied by HSPs. They repress their gene by binding to their specific DNA
sequence when no ligand binds to them, and vice versa.
Certain intracellular receptors of the immune system are cytoplasmic receptors;
recently identified NOD-like_receptors (NLRs) reside in the cytoplasm of some
eukaryotic cells and interact with ligands using a leucine-rich_repeat (LRR)
motif similar to TLRs. Some of these molecules like NOD2 interact with RIP2
kinase that activates NF-ÎºB signaling, whereas others like NALP3 interact with
inflammatory caspases and initiate processing of particular cytokines like
interleukin-1Î².[45][46]
***** Second messengers[edit] *****
Main article: Second_messenger_system
First messengers are the signaling molecules (hormones, neurotransmitters, and
paracrine/autocrine agents) that reach the cell from the extracellular fluid
and bind to their specific receptors. Second messengers are the substances that
enter the cytoplasm and act within the cell to trigger a response. In essence,
second messengers serve as chemical relays from the plasma membrane to the
cytoplasm, thus carrying out intracellular signal transduction.
**** Calcium[edit] ****
The release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic_reticulum into the cytosol
results in its binding to signaling proteins that are then activated; it is
then sequestered in the smooth_endoplasmic_reticulum[47] and the mitochondria.
Two combined receptor/ion channel proteins control the transport of calcium:
the InsP3-receptor that transports calcium upon interaction with inositol
triphosphate on its cytosolic side; and the ryanodine_receptor named after the
alkaloid ryanodine, similar to the InsP3 receptor but having a feedback
mechanism that releases more calcium upon binding with it. The nature of
calcium in the cytosol means that it is active for only a very short time,
meaning its free state concentration is very low and is mostly bound to
organelle molecules like calreticulin when inactive.
Calcium is used in many processes including muscle contraction,
neurotransmitter release from nerve endings, and cell_migration. The three main
pathways that lead to its activation are GPCR pathways, RTK pathways, and gated
ion channels; it regulates proteins either directly or by binding to an enzyme.
**** Lipid messengers[edit] ****
Lipophilic second messenger molecules are derived from lipids residing in
cellular membranes; enzymes stimulated by activated receptors activate the
lipids by modifying them. Examples include diacylglycerol and ceramide, the
former required for the activation of protein_kinase_C.
**** Nitric oxide[edit] ****
Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a second messenger because it is a free_radical that
can diffuse through the plasma membrane and affect nearby cells. It is
synthesised from arginine and oxygen by the NO_synthase and works through
activation of soluble_guanylyl_cyclase, which when activated produces another
second messenger, cGMP. NO can also act through covalent modification of
proteins or their metal co-factors; some have a redox mechanism and are
reversible. It is toxic in high concentrations and causes damage during stroke,
but is the cause of many other functions like relaxation of blood vessels,
apoptosis, and penile erections.
**** Redox signaling[edit] ****
In addition to nitric oxide, other electronically activated species are also
signal-transducing agents in a process called redox_signaling. Examples include
superoxide, hydrogen_peroxide, carbon_monoxide, and hydrogen_sulfide. Redox
signaling also includes active modulation of electronic flows in semiconductive
biological macromolecules.[48]
***** Cellular responses[edit] *****
Gene activations[49] and metabolism alterations[50] are examples of cellular
responses to extracellular stimulation that require signal transduction. Gene
activation leads to further cellular effects, since the products of responding
genes include instigators of activation; transcription factors produced as a
result of a signal transduction cascade can activate even more genes. Hence, an
initial stimulus can trigger the expression of a large number of genes, leading
to physiological events like the increased uptake of glucose from the blood
stream[50] and the migration of neutrophils to sites of infection. The set of
genes and their activation order to certain stimuli is referred to as a genetic
program.[51]
Mammalian cells require stimulation for cell division and survival; in the
absence of growth_factor, apoptosis ensues. Such requirements for extracellular
stimulation are necessary for controlling cell behavior in unicellular and
multicellular organisms; signal transduction pathways are perceived to be so
central to biological processes that a large number of diseases are attributed
to their disregulation. Three basic signals determine cellular growth:
    * Stimulatory (growth factors)
          o Transcription dependent response
            For example, steroids act directly as transcription factor (gives
            slow response, as transcription factor must bind DNA, which needs
            to be transcribed. Produced mRNA needs to be translated, and the
            produced protein/peptide can undergo posttranslational_modification
            (PMT))
          o Transcription independent response
            For example, epidermal_growth_factor (EGF) binds the epidermal
            growth_factor_receptor (EGFR), which causes dimerization and
            autophosphorylation of the EGFR, which in turn activates the
            intracellular signaling pathway .[52]
    * Inhibitory (cell-cell contact)
    * Permissive (cell-matrix interactions)
The combination of these signals are integrated in an altered cytoplasmic
machinery which leads to altered cell behaviour.
***** Major pathways[edit] *****
Following are some major signaling pathways, demonstrating how ligands binding
to their receptors can affect second messengers and eventually result in
altered cellular responses.
    * MAPK/ERK_pathway: A pathway that couples intracellular responses to the
      binding of growth_factors to cell surface receptors.  This pathway is
      very complex and includes many protein components.[53]  In many cell
      types, activation of this pathway promotes cell_division, and many forms
      of cancer are associated with aberrations in it.[54]
    * cAMP-dependent_pathway: In humans, cAMP works by activating protein
      kinase A (PKA, cAMP-dependent_protein_kinase) (see picture), and, thus,
      further effects depend mainly on cAMP-dependent_protein_kinase, which
      vary based on the type of cell.
    * IP3/DAG_pathway: PLC cleaves the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol_4,5-
      bisphosphate (PIP2), yielding diacyl_glycerol (DAG) and inositol_1,4,5-
      triphosphate (IP3).  DAG remains bound to the membrane, and IP3 is
      released as a soluble structure into the cytosol.  IP3 then diffuses
      through the cytosol to bind to IP3_receptors, particular calcium_channels
      in the endoplasmic_reticulum (ER).  These channels are specific to
      calcium and allow the passage of only calcium to move through.  This
      causes the cytosolic concentration of Calcium to increase, causing a
      cascade of intracellular changes and activity.[55]  In addition, calcium
      and DAG together works to activate PKC, which goes on to phosphorylate
      other molecules, leading to altered cellular activity.  End-effects
      include taste, manic depression, tumor promotion, etc.[55]
***** History[edit] *****
Occurrence of the term "signal transduction" in MEDLINE-indexed papers since
1977.
The earliest notion of signal transduction can be traced back to 1855, when
Claude_Bernard proposed that ductless glands such as the spleen, the thyroid
and adrenal_glands, were responsible for the release of "internal secretions"
with physiological effects.[56] Bernard's "secretions" were later named
"hormones" by Ernest_Starling in 1905.[57] Together with William_Bayliss,
Starling had discovered secretin in 1902.[56] Although many other hormones,
most notably insulin, were discovered in the following years, the mechanisms
remained largely unknown.
The discovery of nerve_growth_factor by Rita_Levi-Montalcini in 1954, and
epidermal_growth_factor by Stanley_Cohen in 1962, led to more detailed insights
into the molecular basis of cell signaling, in particular growth_factors.[58]
Their work, together with Earl_Wilbur_Sutherland's discovery of cyclic_AMP in
1956, prompted the redefinition of endocrine_signaling to include only
signaling from glands, while the terms autocrine and paracrine began to be
used.[59] Sutherland was awarded the 1971 Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or
Medicine, while Levi-Montalcini and Cohen shared it in 1986.
In 1970, Martin_Rodbell examined the effects of glucagon on a rat's liver cell
membrane receptor. He noted that guanosine_triphosphate disassociated glucagon
from this receptor and stimulated the G-protein, which strongly influenced the
cell's metabolism. Thus, he deduced that the G-protein is a transducer that
accepts glucagon molecules and affects the cell.[60] For this, he shared the
1994 Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine with Alfred_G._Gilman. Thus, the
characterization of RTKs and GPCRs led to the formulation of the concept of
"signal transduction", a word first used in 1972.[61] Some early articles used
the terms signal transmission and sensory transduction.[62][63] In 2007, a
total of 48,377 scientific papersâincluding 11,211 review_papersâwere
published on the subject. The term first appeared in a paper's title in 1979.
[64][65] Widespread use of the term has been traced to a 1980 review article by
Rodbell:[60][66] Research papers focusing on signal transduction first appeared
in large numbers in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[67]
