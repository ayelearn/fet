Not to be confused with Glycogenesis or Glyceroneogenesis.
Simplified Gluconeogenesis Pathway
Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a metabolic_pathway that results in the generation of
glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates. From breakdown of
proteins, these substrates include glucogenic_amino_acids (although not
ketogenic_amino_acids); from breakdown of lipids (such as triglycerides), they
include glycerol, odd-chain fatty acids (although not even-chain fatty acids,
see below); and from other steps in metabolism they include pyruvate and
lactate.
Gluconeogenesis is one of several main mechanisms used by humans and many other
animals to maintain blood_glucose_levels, avoiding low levels (hypoglycemia).
Other means include the degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis)[1] and fatty
acid_catabolism.
Gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi,
bacteria, and other microorganisms.[2] In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis takes
place mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of the
kidneys. In ruminants, this tends to be a continuous process.[3] In many other
animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, low-
carbohydrate_diets, or intense exercise. The process is highly endergonic until
it is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP or GTP, effectively making the process
exergonic. For example, the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose-6-
phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP to proceed
spontaneously. Gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis.
Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type_2_diabetes, such as the
antidiabetic_drug, metformin, which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates
glucose uptake by cells.[4] In ruminants, because dietary carbohydrates tend to
be metabolized by rumen organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of
fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc.[5]

***** Precursors[edit] *****
Catabolism of proteinogenic_amino_acids. Amino acids are classified according
to the abilities of their products to enter gluconeogenesis:[6]
    * Glucogenic_amino_acids have this ability
    * Ketogenic_amino_acids do not. These products may still be used for
      ketogenesis or lipid_synthesis.
    * Some amino acids are catabolized into both glucogenic and ketogenic
      products.
In humans the main gluconeogenic precursors are lactate, glycerol (which is a
part of the triacylglycerol molecule), alanine and glutamine. Altogether, they
account for over 90% of the overall gluconeogenesis.[7] Other glucogenic_amino
acids as well as all citric_acid_cycle intermediates, the latter through
conversion to oxaloacetate, can also function as substrates for
gluconeogenesis.[8] In ruminants, propionate is the principal gluconeogenic
substrate.[5][9] In nonruminants, including human beings, propionate arises
from the Î²-oxidation of odd-chain and branched-chain fatty acids is a
(relatively minor) substrate for gluconeogenesis.[10][11] Generally,
consumption of gluconeogenic substrates in food does not result in increased
gluconeogenesis.[12].
Lactate is transported back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by
the Cori_cycle using the enzyme lactate_dehydrogenase. Pyruvate, the first
designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to generate
glucose.[8] Transamination or deamination of amino acids facilitates entering
of their carbon skeleton into the cycle directly (as pyruvate or oxaloacetate),
or indirectly via the citric acid cycle. The contribution of Cori cycle lactate
to overall glucose production increases with fasting duration.[13]
Specifically, after 12, 20, and 40 hours of fasting by human volunteers, the
contribution of Cori cycle lactate to gluconeogenesis was 41%, 71%, and 92%,
respectively.[13]
Whether even-chain fatty_acids can be converted into glucose in animals has
been a longstanding question in biochemistry.[14] It is known that odd-chain
fatty_acids can be oxidized to yield propionyl-CoA, a precursor for succinyl-
CoA, which can be converted to pyruvate and enter into gluconeogenesis. In
plants, specifically seedlings, the glyoxylate_cycle can be used to convert
fatty acids (acetate) into the primary carbon source of the organism. The
glyoxylate cycle produces four-carbon dicarboxylic acids that can enter
gluconeogenesis.[8]
In 1995, researchers identified the glyoxylate cycle in nematodes.[15] In
addition, the glyoxylate enzymes malate_synthase and isocitrate_lyase have been
found in animal tissues.[16] Genes coding for malate synthase have been
identified in other metazoans including arthropods, echinoderms, and even some
vertebrates. Mammals found to possess these genes include monotremes (platypus)
and marsupials (opossum) but not placental_mammals. Genes for isocitrate lyase
are found only in nematodes, in which, it is apparent, they originated in
horizontal_gene_transfer from bacteria.
The existence of glyoxylate cycles in humans has not been established, and it
is widely held that fatty acids cannot be converted to glucose in humans
directly. However, carbon-14 has been shown to end up in glucose when it is
supplied in fatty acids.[17] Despite these findings, it is considered unlikely
that the 2-carbon acetyl-CoA derived from the oxidation of fatty acids would
produce a net yield of glucose via the citric_acid_cycle â however, acetyl-
CoA can be converted into pyruvate and lactate through the ketogenic_pathway.
[14][18] Put simply, acetic acid (in the form of acetyl-CoA) is used to
partially produce glucose; acetyl groups can only form part of the glucose
molecules (not the 5th carbon atom) and require extra substrates (such as
pyruvate) in order to form the rest of the glucose molecule. But a roundabout
pathway does lead from acetyl-coA to pyruvate, via acetoacetate, acetone,
hydroxyacetone (acetol) and then either propylene_glycol or methylglyoxal.[18]
[19][20]
***** Location[edit] *****
In mammals, gluconeogenesis has been believed to be restricted to the liver,
[21] the kidney,[21] the intestine,[22] and muscle,[citation_needed] but recent
evidence indicates gluconeogenesis occurring in astrocytes of the brain.[23]
These organs use somewhat different gluconeogenic precursors. The liver
preferentially uses lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids (especially
alanine) while the kidney preferentially uses lactate, glutamine and glycerol.
[24][7] Lactate from the Cori_cycle is quantitatively the largest source of
substrate for gluconeogenesis, especially for the kidney.[7] The liver uses
both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to produce glucose, whereas the kidney
only uses gluconeogenesis.[7] After a meal, the liver shifts to glycogen
synthesis, whereas the kidney increases gluconeogenesis.[12] The intestine uses
mostly glutamine and glycerol.[22]
Propionate is the principal substrate for gluconeogenesis in the ruminant
liver, and the ruminant liver may make increased use of gluconeogenic amino
acids (e.g., alanine) when glucose demand is increased.[25] The capacity of
liver cells to use lactate for gluconeogenesis declines from the preruminant
stage to the ruminant stage in calves and lambs.[26] In sheep kidney tissue,
very high rates of gluconeogenesis from propionate have been observed.[27]
In all species, the formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate and TCA cycle
intermediates is restricted to the mitochondrion, and the enzymes that convert
Phosphoenolpyruvic_acid (PEP) to glucose-6-phosphate are found in the cytosol.
[28] The location of the enzyme that links these two parts of gluconeogenesis
by converting oxaloacetate to PEP â PEP_carboxykinase (PEPCK) â is variable
by species: it can be found entirely within the mitochondria, entirely within
the cytosol, or dispersed evenly between the two, as it is in humans.[28]
Transport of PEP across the mitochondrial_membrane is accomplished by dedicated
transport proteins; however no such proteins exist for oxaloacetate.[28]
Therefore, in species that lack intra-mitochondrial PEPCK, oxaloacetate must be
converted into malate or aspartate, exported from the mitochondrion, and
converted back into oxaloacetate in order to allow gluconeogenesis to continue.
[28]
Gluconeogenesis pathway with key molecules and enzymes. Many steps are the
opposite of those found in the glycolysis.
***** Pathway[edit] *****
Gluconeogenesis is a pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed
reactions. The pathway will begin in either the liver or kidney, in the
mitochondria or cytoplasm of those cells, this being dependent on the substrate
being used. Many of the reactions are the reverse of steps found in glycolysis.
    * Gluconeogenesis begins in the mitochondria with the formation of
      oxaloacetate by the carboxylation of pyruvate. This reaction also
      requires one molecule of ATP, and is catalyzed by pyruvate_carboxylase.
      This enzyme is stimulated by high levels of acetyl-CoA (produced in Î²-
      oxidation in the liver) and inhibited by high levels of ADP and glucose.
    * Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate using NADH, a step required for its
      transportation out of the mitochondria.
    * Malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate using NAD+ in the cytosol, where the
      remaining steps of gluconeogenesis take place.
    * Oxaloacetate is decarboxylated and then phosphorylated to form
      phosphoenolpyruvate using the enzyme PEPCK. A molecule of GTP is
      hydrolyzed to GDP during this reaction.
    * The next steps in the reaction are the same as reversed glycolysis.
      However, fructose_1,6-bisphosphatase converts fructose_1,6-bisphosphate
      to fructose_6-phosphate, using one water molecule and releasing one
      phosphate (in glycolysis, phosphofructokinase_1 converts F6P and ATP to
      F1,6BP and ADP). This is also the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis.
    * Glucose-6-phosphate is formed from fructose_6-phosphate by
      phosphoglucoisomerase (the reverse of step 2 in glycolysis). Glucose-6-
      phosphate can be used in other metabolic pathways or dephosphorylated to
      free glucose. Whereas free glucose can easily diffuse in and out of the
      cell, the phosphorylated form (glucose-6-phosphate) is locked in the
      cell, a mechanism by which intracellular glucose levels are controlled by
      cells.
    * The final gluconeogenesis, the formation of glucose, occurs in the lumen
      of the endoplasmic_reticulum, where glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by
      glucose-6-phosphatase to produce glucose and release an inorganic
      phosphate. Like two steps prior, this step is not a simple reversal of
      glycolysis, in which hexokinase catalyzes the conversion of glucose and
      ATP into G6P and ADP. Glucose is shuttled into the cytoplasm by glucose
      transporters located in the endoplasmic reticulum's membrane.

glycogenesis and glycogenolysis
[Metabolism_of_common_monosaccharides,_and_related_reactions.png]
***** Regulation[edit] *****
While most steps in gluconeogenesis are the reverse of those found in
glycolysis, three regulated and strongly endergonic reactions are replaced with
more kinetically favorable reactions. Hexokinase/glucokinase,
phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate_kinase enzymes of glycolysis are replaced
with glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and PEP_carboxykinase/
pyruvate carboxylase. These enzymes are typically regulated by similar
molecules, but with opposite results. For example, acetyl_CoA and citrate
activate gluconeogenesis enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase and fructose-1,6-
bisphosphatase, respectively), while at the same time inhibiting the glycolytic
enzyme pyruvate_kinase. This system of reciprocal control allow glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis to inhibit each other and prevents a futile_cycle of
synthesizing glucose to only break it down.
The majority of the enzymes responsible for gluconeogenesis are found in the
cytosol; the exceptions are mitochondrial pyruvate_carboxylase and, in animals,
phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase. The latter exists as an isozyme located in
both the mitochondrion and the cytosol.[29] The rate of gluconeogenesis is
ultimately controlled by the action of a key enzyme, fructose-1,6-
bisphosphatase, which is also regulated through signal transduction by cAMP and
its phosphorylation.
Global control of gluconeogenesis is mediated by glucagon (released when blood
glucose is low); it triggers phosphorylation of enzymes and regulatory proteins
by Protein_Kinase_A (a cyclic AMP regulated kinase) resulting in inhibition of
glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis. Insulin counteracts glucagon by
inhibiting gluconeogenesis. Type 2 diabetes is marked by excess glucagon and
insulin_resistance from the body.[30] Insulin can no longer inhibit the gene
expression of enzymes such as PEPCK which leads to increased levels of
hyperglycemia in the body.[31] The anti-diabetic drug metformin reduces blood
glucose primarily through inhibition of gluconeogenesis, overcoming the failure
of insulin to inhibit gluconeogenesis due to insulin resistance.[32]
Studies have shown that the absence of hepatic glucose production has no major
effect on the control of fasting plasma glucose concentration. Compensatory
induction of gluconeogenesis occurs in the kidneys and intestine, driven by
glucagon, glucocorticoids, and acidosis.[33]
