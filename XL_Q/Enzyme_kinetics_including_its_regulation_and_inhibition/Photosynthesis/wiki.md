Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light
energy into chemical_energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms'
activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as
sugars, which are synthesized from carbon_dioxide and water â hence the name
photosynthesis, from the Greek Ïá¿¶Ï, phÅs, "light", and ÏÏÎ½Î¸ÎµÏÎ¹Ï,
synthesis, "putting together".[1][2][3] In most cases, oxygen is also released
as a waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform
photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is
largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen_content of the
Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the
energy necessary for life_on_Earth.[4]
Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the
process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called
reaction_centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. In plants, these
proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts, which are most
abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma
membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip
electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The
hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further
compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to
drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide_adenine
dinucleotide_phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine_triphosphate (ATP), the "energy
currency" of cells.
In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, long-term energy storage in the form of
sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions
called the Calvin_cycle; some bacteria use different mechanisms, such as the
reverse_Krebs_cycle, to achieve the same end. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric
carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds,
such as ribulose_bisphosphate (RuBP).[5] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by
the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and
removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose.
The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary
history_of_life and most likely used reducing_agents such as hydrogen or
hydrogen_sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons.[6] Cyanobacteria
appeared later; the excess_oxygen they produced contributed directly to the
oxygenation_of_the_Earth,[7] which rendered the evolution_of_complex_life
possible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally
is approximately 130 terawatts,[8][9][10] which is about eight times the
current power_consumption_of_human_civilization.[11] Photosynthetic organisms
also convert around 100â115 billion tonnes (91-104 petagrams) of carbon into
biomass per year.[12][13]

***** Overview *****
Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate
O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar.
Photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to
synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light.
However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to
carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than
carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.[4] In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria,
photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called oxygenic photosynthesis and is
by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms.
Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants,
algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these
organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic_photosynthesis, used
mostly by certain types of bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not
release oxygen.
Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon_fixation;
photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into
carbohydrate. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general
outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular_respiration: while
photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrate,
cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrate or other nutrients to
carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates,
amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon
dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's
metabolism. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as
they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in
different cellular_compartments.
The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis_van_Niel
is therefore:[14]
      CO2carbon
      dioxide + 2H2Aelectron donor + photonslight energy â [CH2O]carbohydrate
      + 2Aoxidized
      electron
      donor + H2Owater
Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the
equation for this process is:
      CO2carbon
      dioxide + 2H2Owater + photonslight energy â [CH2O]carbohydrate +
      O2oxygen + H2Owater
This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent
reaction and a product of the light-independent_reaction, but canceling n water
molecules from each side gives the net equation:
      CO2carbon
      dioxide + H2O water  + photonslight energy â [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2
      oxygen
Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the
electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize
arsenite to arsenate:[15] The equation for this reaction is:
      CO2carbon
      dioxide + (AsO3â
      3)
      arsenite + photonslight energy â (AsO3â
      4)
      arsenate + COcarbon
      monoxide(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)[16]
Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent
reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the
energy-storage molecules ATP and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-
independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.
Most organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis use visible_light for the
light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or,
more specifically, far-red radiation.[17]
Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some
archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for
vision in animals. The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response
to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more
directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not
involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have
evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.[18][19]

Main articles: Chloroplast and Thylakoid
In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis
are embedded in cell_membranes. In its simplest form, this involves the
membrane surrounding the cell itself.[20] However, the membrane may be tightly
folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids,[21] or bunched up into round
vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes.[22] These structures can fill most
of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and
therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.[21]
In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called
chloroplasts. A typical plant_cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The
chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a
phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an
intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the
stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are
the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The
thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed
volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are
integral and peripheral_membrane_protein complexes of the photosynthetic
system.
Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll. The green part of
the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that
most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments
such as carotenes and xanthophylls.[23] Algae also use chlorophyll, but various
other pigments are present, such as phycocyanin, carotenes, and xanthophylls in
green_algae, phycoerythrin in red_algae (rhodophytes) and fucoxanthin in brown
algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors.
These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna
proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a
combination of proteins is also called a light-harvesting_complex.[24]
Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the
majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves.
Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity, such as
many Euphorbia and cactus species, have their main photosynthetic organs in
their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the mesophyll,
can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square
millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant
waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and
decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to reduce heating. The
transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade
mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.
***** Light-dependent reactions *****
Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane
Main article: Light-dependent_reactions
In the light-dependent_reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll
absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is passed to a
modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a
quinone molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an electron_transport
chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH. In addition, this
creates a proton_gradient (energy gradient) across the chloroplast_membrane,
which is used by ATP_synthase in the synthesis of ATP. The chlorophyll molecule
ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a
process called photolysis, which releases a dioxygen (O2) molecule as a waste
product.
The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of
non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:[25]
      2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light â 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2
Not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic
action spectrum depends on the type of accessory_pigments present. For example,
in green plants, the action_spectrum resembles the absorption_spectrum for
chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red
light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows
these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters
that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above ground green
plants. The non-absorbed part of the light_spectrum is what gives
photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple
bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective
organisms.
**** Z scheme ****
The "Z scheme"
In plants, light-dependent_reactions occur in the thylakoid_membranes of the
chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-
dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.
In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting
antenna_complexes of photosystem_II by chlorophyll and other accessory_pigments
(see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees
an electron by a process called photoinduced_charge_separation. The antenna
system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II
reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-
acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an
electron_transport_chain (the so-called Z-scheme shown in the diagram), it
initially functions to generate a chemiosmotic_potential by pumping proton
cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An ATP_synthase
enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during
photophosphorylation, whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction
in the Z-scheme. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem_I.
There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem. The
electron is then passed along a chain of electron_acceptors to which it
transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is
used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The
electron is eventually used to reduce the co-enzyme NADP with a H+ to NADPH
(which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the
path of that electron ends.
The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic, but differs in that
it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic
reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from
the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules
and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name cyclic
reaction.
**** Water photolysis ****
Main articles: Photodissociation and Oxygen_evolution
Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center
of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-
reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction
center (P700) of photosystem_I are replaced by transfer from plastocyanin,
whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem_II.
Photosystem II, as the first step of the Z-scheme, requires an external source
of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center, called P680.
The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is
water. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation
reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four
hydrogen ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active tyrosine
residue that then reduces the oxidized P680. This resets the ability of P680 to
absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The
oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by a redox-active structure
that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion; this oxygen-evolving
complex binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents
that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Dolai's S-state diagrams).
[26] Photosystem II is the only known biological enzyme that carries out this
oxidation of water. The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and
therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to
ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the
majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen for cellular_respiration, including
photosynthetic organisms.[27][28]
***** Light-independent reactions *****
**** Calvin cycle ****
Main articles: Light-independent_reactions and Carbon_fixation
In the light-independent (or "dark") reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2
from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin_cycle, it uses the
newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined
to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent
reactions in green plants is[25]:128
      3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ â C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6
      NADP+ + 3 H2O
Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation
Carbon_fixation produces the intermediate three-carbon sugar product, which is
then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars
produced by photosynthesis are then used in the forming of other organic
compounds, such as the building material cellulose, the precursors for lipid
and amino_acid biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular_respiration. The latter
occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the energy from plants is
passed through a food_chain.
The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon
dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose_1,5-bisphosphate, to yield
two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate_3-phosphate, also known as
3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of ATP and NADPH
produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde_3-
phosphate. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL)
or, more generically, as triose phosphate. Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-
bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus
"recycled" often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately yield
sucrose, starch and cellulose. The sugars produced during carbon metabolism
yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the
production of amino_acids and lipids.
**** Carbon concentrating mechanisms ****
*** On land ***
Overview of C4_carbon_fixation
In hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss.
Under these conditions, CO
2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of
photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of photorespiration by the
oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate_carboxylase/oxygenase and
decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase
the CO
2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions.[29]
Main article: C4_carbon_fixation
Plants that use the C4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in
the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule
phosphoenolpyruvate_(PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP
carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic_acid.
Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to
specialized bundle_sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle
enzymes are located, and where CO
2 released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO
activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric_acids. The physical separation
of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration
and increases CO
2 fixation and, thus, the photosynthetic_capacity of the leaf.[30] C4 plants
can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and
temperature. Many important crop plants are C4 plants, including maize,
sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in
carbon fixation are called C3_plants because the primary carboxylation
reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric
acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C3 carbon
fixation, compared to 3% that use C4 carbon fixation;[31] however, the
evolution of C4 in over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of
convergent_evolution.[29]
Main article: CAM_photosynthesis
Xerophytes, such as cacti and most succulents, also use PEP carboxylase to
capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean_acid_metabolism (CAM).
In contrast to C4 metabolism, which spatially separates the CO
2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM temporally separates these two
processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants, and fix the
CO
2 at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the CO
2 mostly in the form of malic_acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to
oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during
the day releases CO
2 inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by
RuBisCO. Sixteen thousand species of plants use CAM.[32]
*** In water ***
Cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes, which increase the concentration of CO
2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, carbonic
anhydrase, located within the carboxysome releases CO2 from the dissolved
hydrocarbonate ions (HCOâ
3). Before the CO2 diffuses out it is quickly sponged up by RuBisCO, which is
concentrated within the carboxysomes. HCOâ
3 ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are
actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the
membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2
very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCOâ
3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the
carboxysomes.[33] Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate CO
2 around RuBisCO.[34]
***** Order and kinetics *****
The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:[13]
Stage Description                                   Time scale
1     Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll        femtosecond to picosecond

3     Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis    microsecond to millisecond

4     Carbon fixation and export of stable products millisecond to second
***** Efficiency *****
Main article: Photosynthetic_efficiency
Plants usually convert light into chemical_energy with a photosynthetic
efficiency of 3â6%.[35] Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated
primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1â2%)[36] re-emitted as chlorophyll
fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of
the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.[37]
Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light
being converted, light intensity, temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.[38] By comparison, solar
panels convert light into electric_energy at an efficiency of approximately
6â20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices.
The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured but the
relationship between the two can be complex.[39] For example, the ATP and NADPH
energy molecules, created by the light reaction, can be used for carbon
fixation or for photorespiration in C3 plants.[39] Electrons may also flow to
other electron sinks.[40][41][42] For this reason, it is not uncommon for
authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory
conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.[43][44][45]
Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and
Infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction.[46] It is also possible
to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll
fluorometer and gas exchange system, or by using two separate systems together.
[47] Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to
measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2, and of ÎH2O using reliable
methods[48] CO2 is commonly measured in Î¼mols/m2/sâ1, parts per million or
volume per million and H20 is commonly measured in mmol/m2/sâ1 or in mbars.
[48] By measuring CO2 assimilation, ÎH2O, leaf temperature, barometric
pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, it becomes
possible to estimate, âAâ or carbon assimilation, âEâ or transpiration,
âgsâ or stomatal conductance, and Ci or intracellular CO2.[48] However, it
is more common to used chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement,
where appropriate, because the most commonly used measuring parameters FV/FM
and Y(II) or F/FMâ can be made in a few seconds, allowing the measurement of
larger plant populations.[45]
Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below ambient,
allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO2
levels, to characterize a plantâs photosynthetic response.[48]
Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer â gas exchange systems allow a more
precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms.[46][47] While
standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2
levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows
a more precise measurement of CC to replace Ci.[47][49] The estimation of CO2
at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, or CC, becomes possible with
the measurement of mesophyll conductance or gm using an integrated system.[46]
[47][50]
Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the
amount of light absorbed by the leaf. But analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence,
P700- and P515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed
information about e.g. the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2
assimilation rates. With some instruments even wavelength-dependency of the
photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.[51]
A phenomenon known as quantum_walk increases the efficiency of the energy
transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an algae,
bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores
arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is
absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as
an exciton, which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction
center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in
a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cell's metabolism. The
exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several
possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously "choose" the most
efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its
destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes
place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is
only possible over very short distances, due to obstacles in the form of
destructive interference that come into play. These obstacles cause the
particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once
again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic "hop". The
movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a
series of conventional hops and quantum walks.[52][53][54]

Main article: Evolution_of_photosynthesis
Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in green and purple_sulfur and
green and purple_nonsulfur_bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, and
used various other molecules than water as electron_donors. Green and purple
sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron
donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic_acids as
an electron donor. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific
organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological
evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly reducing at that_time.[55]
Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have
been dated at 3.4 billion years old.[56][57] More recent studies, reported in
March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion
years ago.[58][59]
The main source of oxygen in the Earth's_atmosphere derives from oxygenic
photosynthesis, and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen
catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as
that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around
2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic
prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron
donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen (O
2) in the photosynthetic_reaction_center.
**** Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts ****
Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, Plagiomnium_affine)
Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with
photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges and sea
anemones. It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple body_plans
and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.[60] In
addition, a few marine mollusks Elysia_viridis and Elysia_chlorotica also
maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae
in their diet and then store in their bodies (see Kleptoplasty). This allows
the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.
[61][62] Some of the genes from the plant cell_nucleus have even been
transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with
proteins that they need to survive.[63]
An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts.
Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a
circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosome, and similar proteins in the
photosynthetic reaction center.[64][65] The endosymbiotic_theory suggests that
photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic
cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be
photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like
mitochondria, chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear_DNA
of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those
found in cyanobacteria.[66] DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such
as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR_Hypothesis
proposes that this Co-location of genes with their gene products is required
for Redox Regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of
DNA in bioenergetic organelles.[67]
**** Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages ****
Symbiotic and kleptoplastic organisms excluded:
    * The glaucophytes and the red and green_algaeâclade Archaeplastida
      (unicellular and multicellular)

    * The chlorarachniophytes and three species of Paulinellaâcclade Rhizaria
      (unicellular)
    * The euglenidsâcclade Excavata (unicellular)
**** Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis ****
The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in
photosynthesis evolved once, in a common_ancestor of extant cyanobacteria
(formerly called blue-green algae). The geological record indicates that this
transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450â2320
million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.[68][69] Because
the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated
development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic
cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.[70] Available evidence from
geobiological studies of Archean (>2500 Ma) sedimentary_rocks indicates that
life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved
is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution
opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of Cyanobacteria.
Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary_producers of oxygen throughout the
Proterozoic_Eon (2500â543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the
oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen_fixation.[citation_needed]
Green_algae joined blue-green algae as the major primary producers of oxygen on
continental_shelves near the end of the Proterozoic, but it was only with the
Mesozoic (251â66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and
diatoms did the primary_production of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern
form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine_ecosystems as primary_producers
of_oxygen in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in
modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.[71]
***** Discovery *****
Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely
understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th
century.
Portrait of Jan_Baptist_van_Helmont by Mary_Beale, c.1674
Jan_van_Helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when
he carefully measured the mass of the soil used by a plant and the mass of the
plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he
hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the
only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially
accurate â much of the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide as well as
water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a
plant's biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.
Joseph_Priestley, a chemist and minister, discovered that, when he isolated a
volume of air under an inverted jar, and burned a candle in it (which gave off
CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He
further discovered that a mouse could similarly "injure" air. He then showed
that the air that had been "injured" by the candle and the mouse could be
restored by a plant.
In 1778, Jan_Ingenhousz, repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that
it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a
mouse in a matter of hours.
In 1796, Jean_Senebier, a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated
that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence
of light. Soon afterward, Nicolas-ThÃ©odore_de_Saussure showed that the
increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of
CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which
photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.
Cornelis_Van_Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of
photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria he was
the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox
reaction, in which hydrogen reduces (donates its â electron to) carbon
dioxide.
Robert_Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity
using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions
were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more
substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm
wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is
PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll "a", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll "a"
with most of the available chlorophyll "b", among other pigment. These include
phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae
respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most
productive when the absorption of quanta are equal in both the PSII and PSI,
assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI
and PSII system, which in turn powers the photochemistry.[13]
Robert_Hill thought that a complex of reactions consisting of an intermediate
to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), another is from cytochrome f to a step
in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone,
which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f for it is a sufficient
reductant. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the
photosynthesis of green plants came from water, were performed by Hill in 1937
and 1939. He showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence
of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate, ferricyanide or benzoquinone
after exposure to light. The Hill reaction[72] is as follows:
      2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) â 2 AH2 + O2
where A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is
reduced and oxygen is evolved.
Samuel_Ruben and Martin_Kamen used radioactive_isotopes to determine that the
oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water.
Melvin_Calvin works in his photosynthesis laboratory.
Melvin_Calvin and Andrew_Benson, along with James_Bassham, elucidated the path
of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants.
The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin_cycle, which ignores the
contribution of Bassham and Benson. Many scientists refer to the cycle as the
Calvin-Benson Cycle, Benson-Calvin, and some even call it the Calvin-Benson-
Bassham (or CBB) Cycle.
Nobel_Prize-winning scientist Rudolph_A._Marcus was able to discover the
function and significance of the electron transport chain.
Otto_Heinrich_Warburg and Dean_Burk discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis
reaction that splits the CO2, activated by the respiration.[73]
In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation
in vivo was presented by Otto_Kandler using intact Chlorella cells and
interpreting his findings as light-dependent ATP formation.[74] In 1954, Daniel
I._Arnon et al. discovered photophosphorylation in vitro in isolated
chloroplasts with the help of P32.[75][76]
Louis_N.M._Duysens and Jan_Amesz discovered that chlorophyll a will absorb one
light, oxidize cytochrome f, chlorophyll a (and other pigments) will absorb
another light, but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two
light reactions are in series.
**** Development of the concept ****
In 1893, Charles_Reid_Barnes proposed two terms, photosyntax and
photosynthesis, for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon
compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the
influence of light. Over time, the term photosynthesis came into common usage
as the term of choice. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria
and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.[77]
**** C3 : C4 photosynthesis research ****
After WWII at late 1940 at the University_of_California,_Berkeley, the details
of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin
Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers
utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.[78] The
pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae Chlorella in a fraction of a second in
light resulted in a 3 carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For
that original and ground-breaking work, a Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry was awarded
to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas
exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber
where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 Î¼mol
CO2Â·mâ2Â·sâ1, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants having the
same photosynthetic capacities that were light saturated at less than 50% of
sunlight.[79][80]
Later in 1958-1963 at Cornell_University, field grown maize was reported to
have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 Î¼mol CO2Â·mâ2Â·sâ1 and
was not saturated at near full sunlight.[81][82] This higher rate in maize was
almost double those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean,
indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants.
At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15
species of monocot and dicot uncovered for the first time that differences in
leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities
among species.[83][84] In tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum,
sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates
were around 38â40 Î¼mol CO2Â·mâ2Â·sâ1, and the leaves have two types of
green cells, i. e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed
cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed
Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb_Haberlandt while
studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane.[85] Plant species with the greatest
photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration,
very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal
resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never
saturated at full sun light.[86] The research at Arizona was designated
Citation Classic by the ISI 1986.[84] These species was later termed C4 plants
as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has 4 carbon as malate
and aspartate.[87][88][89] Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3
type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the
3-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had
similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 Î¼mol CO2Â·mâ2Â·sâ1 indicating
the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants.[83][84]
***** Factors *****
The leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants.
There are three main factors affecting photosynthesis[clarification_needed] and
several corollary factors. The three main are:[citation_needed]
    * Light irradiance and wavelength
    * Carbon_dioxide concentration
    * Temperature.
Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These
include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to
capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of
photosynthesis), rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the
chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the
availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.[90]
**** Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature ****
See also: PI_(photosynthesis-irradiance)_curve
Absorbance spectra of free chlorophyll a (blue) and b (red) in a solvent. The
action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending
on specific pigment-protein interactions.
The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the
biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for
plant life.[91]
The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, with both
time and space.
In the early 20th century, Frederick_Blackman and Gabrielle_Matthaei
investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on the
rate of carbon assimilation.
    * At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with
      irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a
      plateau at higher irradiance.
    * At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the
      rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of
      carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased.
These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known
that, in general, photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature.
However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of
carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process
of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent_'photochemical'
temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent,_temperature-dependent
stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of limiting
factors. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria,
which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths
required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic
pigments. To combat this problem, a series of proteins with different pigments
surround the reaction center. This unit is called a phycobilisome.
[clarification_needed]
**** Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration ****
Photorespiration
As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the
light-independent_reactions increases until limited by other factors. RuBisCO,
the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has
a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration
of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix_carbon_dioxide. However, if the
carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon
dioxide. This process, called photorespiration, uses energy, but does not
produce sugars.
RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:
   1. One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead
      of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized
      by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A
      high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required
      to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the
      Calvin-Benson_cycle.
   2. Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a
      plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis.
   3. Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the
      glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-
      Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce ammonia
      (NH3), which is able to diffuse out of the plant, leading to a loss of
      nitrogen.
            A highly simplified summary is:
                  2 glycolate + ATP â 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide +
                  ADP + NH3
The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more
commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-
dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.
