The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a molecule found on the surface of T_cells, or T
lymphocytes,[1] that is responsible for recognizing fragments of antigen as
peptides bound to major_histocompatibility_complex (MHC) molecules. The binding
between TCR and antigen peptides is of relatively low affinity and is
degenerate: that is, many TCRs recognize the same antigen peptide and many
antigen peptides are recognized by the same TCR.[2]
The TCR is composed of two different protein chains (that is, it is a
heterodimer). In humans, in 95% of T cells the TCR consists of an alpha (Î±)
chain and a beta (Î²) chain (encoded by TRA and TRB, respectively), whereas in
5% of T cells the TCR consists of gamma_and_delta (Î³/Î´) chains (encoded by
TRG and TRD, respectively). This ratio changes during ontogeny and in diseased
states (such as leukemia). It also differs between species. Orthologues of the
4 loci have been mapped in various species.[3][4] Each locus can produce a
variety of polypeptides with constant and variable regions.[3]
When the TCR engages with antigenic peptide and MHC (peptide/MHC), the T
lymphocyte is activated through signal_transduction, that is, a series of
biochemical events mediated by associated enzymes, co-receptors, specialized
adaptor molecules, and activated or released transcription_factors.

***** History of the TCR[edit] *****
In 1984, Tak_Wah_Mak[5] and Mark_M._Davis[6] discovered the human and mouse TCR
respectively. These findings allowed the entity and structure of the elusive
TCR, known before as the "Holy Grail of Immunology", to be revealed. This
allowed scientists from around the world to carry out studies on the TCR,
leading to important studies in the fields of CAR-T, Cancer_immunotherapy and
Checkpoint_inhibition.
***** Structural characteristics of the TCR[edit] *****
The TCR is a disulfide-linked membrane-anchored heterodimeric protein normally
consisting of the highly variable alpha (Î±) and beta (Î²) chains expressed as
part of a complex with the invariant CD3 chain molecules. T cells expressing
this receptor are referred to as Î±:Î² (or Î±Î²) T cells, though a minority of
T cells express an alternate receptor, formed by variable gamma (Î³) and delta
(Î´) chains, referred as Î³Î´ T cells.[7]
Each chain is composed of two extracellular domains: Variable (V) region and a
Constant (C) region, both of Immunoglobulin_superfamily (IgSF) domain forming
antiparallel Î²-sheets. The Constant region is proximal to the cell membrane,
followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail, while the
Variable region binds to the peptide/MHC complex.
The variable domain of both the TCR Î±-chain and Î²-chain each have three
hypervariable or complementarity_determining_regions (CDRs). There is also an
additional area of hypervariability on the Î²-chain (HV4) that does not
normally contact antigen and, therefore, is not considered a CDR.
The residues in these variable domains are located in two regions of the TCR,
at the interface of the Î±- and Î²-chains and in the Î²-chain framework_region
that is thought to be in proximity to the CD3 signal-transduction complex.[8]
CDR3 is the main CDR responsible for recognizing processed_antigen, although
CDR1 of the alpha chain has also been shown to interact with the N-terminal
part of the antigenic peptide, whereas CDR1 of the Î²-chain interacts with the
C-terminal part of the peptide.
CDR2 is thought to recognize the MHC. CDR4 of the Î²-chain is not thought to
participate in antigen recognition, but has been shown to interact with
superantigens.
The constant domain of the TCR consists of short connecting sequences in which
a cysteine residue forms disulfide bonds, which form a link between the two
chains.
The TCR is a member of the immunoglobulin_superfamily, a large group of
proteins involved in binding, recognition, and adhesion; the family is named
after antibodies (also called immunoglobulins). The TCR is similar to a half-
antibody consisting of a single heavy and single light chain, except the heavy
chain is without its crystallisable fraction (Fc). The two subunits of TCR are
twisted together. Whereas the antibody uses its Fc region to bind to Fc
Receptors on leukocytes, TCR is already docked onto the cell membrane. However,
it is not able to mediate signal transduction itself due to its short
cytoplasmic tail, so TCR still requires CD3 and zeta to carry out the signal
transduction in its place, just as antibodies require binding to FcRs to
initiate signal transduction. In this way the MHC-TCR-CD3 interaction for T
cells is functionally similar to the antigen(Ag)-immunoglobulin(Ig)-FcR
interaction for myeloid leukocytes, and Ag-Ig-CD79 interaction for B cells.
***** Generation of the TCR diversity[edit] *****
The generation of TCR diversity is similar to that for antibodies and B_cell
antigen_receptors. It arises mainly from genetic_recombination of the DNA
encoded segments in individual somatic T cells by somatic_V(D)J_recombination
using RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases. Unlike immunoglobulins, however, TCR genes do
not undergo somatic hypermutation, and T cells do not express activation-
induced_cytidine_deaminase(AID). The recombination process that creates
diversity in BCR (antibodies) and TCR is unique to lymphocytes (T and B cells)
during the early stages of their development in primary lymphoid organs (thymus
for T cells, bone_marrow for B cells).
Each recombined TCR possess unique antigen specificity, determined by the
structure of the antigen-binding_site formed by the Î± and Î² chains in case of
Î±Î² T cells or Î³ and Î´ chains on case of Î³Î´ T cells.[9]
    * The TCR alpha chain is generated by VJ_recombination, whereas the beta
      chain is generated by VDJ recombination (both involving a random joining
      of gene segments to generate the complete TCR chain).
    * Likewise, generation of the TCR gamma chain involves VJ recombination,
      whereas generation of the TCR delta chain occurs by VDJ recombination.
The intersection of these specific regions (V and J for the alpha or gamma
chain; V, D, and J for the beta or delta chain) corresponds to the CDR3 region
that is important for peptide/MHC recognition (see above).
It is the unique combination of the segments at this region, along with
palindromic and random nucleotide additions (respectively termed "P-" and "N-
"), which accounts for the even greater diversity of T-cell receptor
specificity for processed antigenic peptides.
Later during development, individual CDR_loops of TCR can be re-edited in the
periphery outside thymus by reactivation of recombinases using a process termed
TCR_revision (editing) and change its antigenic specificity.
***** The TCR complex[edit] *****
The TCR receptor complex is an octomeric complex of variable TCR receptor Î±
and Î² chains with three dimeric signaling modules CD3Î´/Îµ, CD3Î³/Îµ and CD247
Î¶/Î¶ or Î¶/Î·. Ionizable residues in the transmembrane domain of each subunit
form a polar network of interactions that hold the complex together.[10] Since
the cytoplasmic tail of the TCR is extremely short, making it unlikely to
participate in signaling, these signaling molecules are vital in propagating
the signal from the triggered TCR into the cell.
Each T cell expresses clonal TCRs which recognize specific peptide/MHC complex
during physical contact between T cell and antigen-presenting_cell-APC (MHC
class_II) or any other cell type (MHC_class_I) [11] High on-rate and off-rate
is characteristic for TCR and peptide/MHC interaction at physiological
temperature. TCRs have very high degree of antigen specificity, despite of fact
that the affinity to the peptide/MHC ligand is in the micromolar range.[12]
This weak binding (     K  D     {\displaystyle K_{D}}  [K_{D}] dissociation
constant values) between TCR and peptide/MHC was determined by the surface
plasmon_resonance (SPR) to be in the range 1-100 Î¼M, the association constant
in the range from 1000 to 10000  Mâ1Ãsâ1,[13] The TCR affinity for
peptided/MHC has a direct impact on modulation of T-cell function. T cells are
very sensitive to their antigens despite the low affinity of TCR for its
peptide/MHC and low numbers of specific peptide/MHC on the surface of target
cells.[14] The specific and efficient signaling via TCR might be regulated by
dynamic oligomerization into TCR microclusters on the surface of T cells.[15]
In this scenario, T-cell sensitivity to antigen could be increased via avidity-
based mechanism. The antigen sensitivity is higher in antigen-experienced T
cells than in naive T cells. Naive T cells pass through the process of
functional avidity maturation with no change in affinity. It is based on the
fact that effector and memory (antigen-experienced) T cell are less dependent
on costimulatory signals and higher antigen concentration than naive T cell.
[16]
T-Cell Receptor complexed with MHC I and II
***** TCR co-receptors[edit] *****
The signal from the T-cell complex is enhanced by simultaneous binding of the
MHC molecules by a specific co-receptor.
    * On helper_T_cells and regulatory_T_cells, this co-receptor is CD4 that is
      specific for MHC_class_II.
    * On cytotoxic_T_cells, this co-receptor is CD8 that is specific for MHC
      class_I.
Extracellularly, the TCR co-receptor defines the specificity of the TCR to MHC
class I or II molecule, and increases binding affinity of TCR to MHC to prolong
the cell-cell interaction between the antigen-presenting_cell and the T cell.
Intracellularly, the TCR co-receptor recruits essential molecules (e.g., LCK)
involved in the signaling of the activated T lymphocyte to facilitate the CD3
signal transduction mechanism.

***** Associated molecules of the TCR complex involved in T-cell activation
[edit] *****
The essential function of the TCR complex is to identify specific bound antigen
and elicit a distinct and critical response. The signal transduction mechanism
by which a T cell elicits this response upon contact with its unique antigen is
termed T-cell activation (just as phototransduction is the term given to the
signal transduction event by which photoreceptors elicits vision upon exposure
to photons). There are myriad molecules involved in the complex biochemical
process (called trans-membrane_signaling) by which T-cell activation occurs.
The most common mechanism for activation and regulation of molecules beneath
the lipid bilayer is via reversible tyrosine phosphorylation by protein kinase/
phosphatase. T cells utilise the Src_family_kinases in transmembrane signalling
largely to phosphorylate tyrosines that are part of immunoreceptor_tyrosine-
based_activation_motifs (ITAM) in intracellular parts of CD3 and Î¶ chains.[17]
Early signaling steps implicate the following kinases and phosphatases after
TCR triggering:
    * Lck â a Src family kinase associated with the intracellular tail of CD4
      that phosphorylates CD3 and Î¶ ITAMs of the TCR complex
    * FYN â a Src family kinase that phosphorylates CD3 and Î¶ ITAMs
    * CD45 â a transmembrane protein whose intracellular tail functions as a
      tyrosine phosphatase that activates Src family kinases
    * Zap70 â a Syk family kinase that binds to ITAM sequences upon tyrosine
      phosphorylation by Lck and Fyn, and phosphorylates LAT
When a T-cell receptor is activated by contact with a peptide:MHC complex, CD45
dephosphorylates inhibitory tyrosine of membrane-localized Src_family_kinases
Fyn and Lck, previously recruited and activated by CD4 or CD8 coreceptors.
Activated Fyn and Lck phosphorylates ITAMs on the CD3 and Î¶ chains. This
allows cytoplasmic kinases of the Syk family (ZAP-70) to bind to the ITAM and
activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates tyrosines on the adaptor protein LAT, which
then attracts PLC-Î³. Other downstream pathways are triggered as well (MAPK,
NF-ÎºB, NFAT) which results in gene transcription in the nucleus.[18]
