Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of 2 microLitre of normal human serum. The
electrophoresis was performed in thin layers of agarose, the pictured gel is
about 7x7 cm. The lower part is the first dimension gel without antibodies,
where the serum was applied into the slot at the lower left. The upper part is
the second dimension gel with Dako antibodies against human serum proteins.
More than 50 major serum proteins can be named.
Fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis of an affinity chromatographic separation of
human serum proteins on con_A. A 15 microlitre sample from each fraction is
applied (starting from left) and let to diffuse about one hour, then
electrophorsis was performed over night. Peak "a" is unretained, peak "b" is
retained and eluted with methyl-mannose, the arrow indicates som slightly
retained proteins.
Immunoelectrophoresis is a general name for a number of biochemical methods for
separation and characterization of proteins based on electrophoresis and
reaction with antibodies. All variants of immunoelectrophoresis require
immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, reacting with the proteins to be
separated or characterized. The methods were developed and used extensively
during the second half of the 20th century. In somewhat chronological order:
Immunoelectrophoretic analysis (one-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis ad modum
Grabar), crossed immunoelectrophoresis (two-dimensional quantitative
immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell), rocket-
immunoelectrophoresis (one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad
modum Laurell), fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Svendsen and
Harboe, affinity_immunoelectrophoresis ad modum BÃ¸g-Hansen.
Agarose as 1% gel slabs of about 1 mm thickness buffered at high pH (around
8.6) is traditionally preferred for the electrophoresis as well as the reaction
with antibodies. The agarose was chosen as the gel matrix because it has large
pores allowing free passage and separation of proteins, but provides an anchor
for the immunoprecipitates of protein and specific antibodies. The high pH was
chosen because antibodies are practically immobile at high pH. An
electrophoresis equipment with a horizontal cooling plate was normally
recommended for the electrophoresis.
Immunoprecipitates may be seen in the wet agarose gel, but are stained with
protein stains like Coomassie_Brilliant_Blue in the dried gel. In contrast to
SDS-gel_electrophoresis, the electrophoresis in agarose allows native
conditions, preserving the native structure and activities of the proteins
under investigation, therefore immunoelectrophoresis allows characterization of
enzyme activities and ligand binding etc. in addition to electrophoretic
separation.
The immunoelectrophoretic analysis ad modum Grabar is the classical method of
immunoelectrophoresis. Proteins are separated by electrophoresis, then
antibodies are applied in a trough next to the separated proteins and
immunoprecipitates are formed after a period of diffusion of the separated
proteins and antibodies against each other. The introduction of the
immunoelectrophoretic analysis gave a great boost to protein chemistry, some of
the very first results were the resolution of proteins in biological fluids and
biological extracts. Among the important observations made were the great
number of different proteins in serum, the existence of several immunoglobulin
classes and their electrophoretic heterogeneity.

Crossed immunoelectrophoresis is also called two-dimensional quantitative
immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell. In this
method the proteins are first separated during the first dimension
electrophoresis, then instead of the diffusion towards the antibodies, the
proteins are electrophoresed into an antibody-containing gel in the second
dimension. Immunoprecipitation will take place during the second dimension
electrophorsis and the immunoprecipitates have a characteristic bell-shape,
each precipitate representing one antigen, the position of the precipitate
being dependent on the amount of protein as well as the amount of specific
antibody in the gel, so relative quantification can be performed. The
sensitivity and resolving power of crossed immunoelectrophoresis is than that
of the classical immunoelectrophoretic analysis and there are multiple
variations of the technique useful for various purposes. Crossed
immunoelectrophoresis has been used for studies of proteins in biological
fluids, particularly human serum, and biological extracts.
Rocket immunoelectrophoresis is one-dimensional quantitative
immunoelectrophoresis. The method has been used for quantitation of human serum
proteins before automated methods became available.
Fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis is a modification of one-dimensional
quantitative immunoelectrophorsis used for detailed measurement of proteins in
fractions from protein separation experiments.
Affinity immunoelectrophoresis is based on changes in the electrophoretic
pattern of proteins through specific interaction or complex_formation with
other macromolecules or ligands. Affinity_immunoelectrophoresis has been used
for estimation of binding_constants, as for instance with lectins or for
characterization of proteins with specific features like glycan content or
ligand binding. Some variants of affinity immunoelectrophoresis are similar to
affinity_chromatography by use of immobilized ligands.
The open structure of the immunoprecipitate in the agarose gel will allow
additional binding of radioactively labeled antibodies to reveal specific
proteins. This variation has been used for identification of allergens through
reaction with IgE.
Two factors determine that immunoelectrophoretic methods are not widely used.
First they are rather work intensive and require some manual expertise. Second
they require rather large amounts of polyclonal antibodies. Today gel
electrophoresis followed by electroblotting is the preferred method for protein
characterization because its ease of operation, its high sensitivity, and its
low requirement for specific antibodies. In addition proteins are separated by
gel_electrophoresis on the basis of their apparent molecular weight, which is
not accomplished by immunoelectrophoresis, but nevertheless
immunoelectrophoretic methods are still useful when non-reducing conditions are
needed.
