Canning is a method of preserving_food in which the food contents are processed
and sealed in an airtight container (jars like Mason_jars, and steel_and_tin
cans). Canning provides a shelf_life typically ranging from one to five years,
although under specific circumstances it can be much longer.[1] A freeze-dried
canned product, such as canned dried lentils, could last as long as 30 years in
an edible state. In 1974, samples of canned food from the wreck of the
Bertrand, a steamboat that sank in the Missouri River in 1865, were tested by
the National_Food_Processors_Association. Although appearance, smell and
vitamin content had deteriorated, there was no trace of microbial growth and
the 109-year-old food was determined to be still safe to eat.[2]

***** History and development of canning[edit] *****
See also: Mason_jar
**** French origins[edit] ****
During the first years of the Napoleonic_Wars, the French government offered a
hefty cash award of 12,000 francs to any inventor who could devise a cheap and
effective method of preserving large amounts of food. The larger armies of the
period required increased and regular supplies of quality food. Limited food
availability was among the factors limiting military campaigns to the summer
and autumn months. In 1809, Nicolas_Appert, a French confectioner and brewer,
observed that food cooked inside a jar did not spoil unless the seals leaked,
and developed a method of sealing food in glass jars.[3] Appert was awarded the
prize in 1810 by Count Montelivert, a French minister of the interior.[4] The
reason for lack of spoilage was unknown at the time, since it would be another
50 years before Louis_Pasteur demonstrated the role of microbes in food
spoilage.

Nicolas_Appert, developer of the canning process
The French Army began experimenting with issuing canned foods to its soldiers,
but the slow process of canning foods and the even slower development and
transport stages prevented the army from shipping large amounts across the
French_Empire, and the war ended before the process was perfected.
Following the end of the Napoleonic_Wars, the canning process was gradually
employed in other European countries and in the US.
**** In the United Kingdom[edit] ****

Based on Appert's methods of food preservation, the tin_can process was
allegedly developed by Frenchman Philippe_de_Girard, who came to London and
used British merchant Peter Durand as an agent to patent his own idea in 1810.
[5] Durand did not pursue food canning himself, selling his patent in 1811 to
Bryan_Donkin and John_Hall, who were in business as Donkin Hall and Gamble, of
Bermondsey.[6] Bryan Donkin developed the process of packaging food in sealed
airtight cans, made of tinned wrought iron. Initially, the canning process was
slow and labour-intensive, as each large can had to be hand-made, and took up
to six hours to cook, making canned food too expensive for ordinary people.
The main market for the food at this stage was the British_Army and Royal_Navy.
By 1817 Donkin recorded that he had sold Â£3000 worth of canned meat in six
months. In 1824 Sir William_Edward_Parry took canned beef and pea soup with him
on his voyage to the Arctic in HMS Fury, during his search for a northwestern
passage to India. In 1829, Admiral Sir James_Ross also took canned food to the
Arctic, as did Sir John_Franklin in 1845.[7] Some of his stores were found by
the search expedition led by Captain (later Admiral Sir) Leopold_McClintock in
1857. One of these cans was opened in 1939, and was edible and nutritious,
though it was not analysed for contamination by the lead solder used in its
manufacture.
**** In Europe[edit] ****
During the mid-19th century, canned food became a status_symbol amongst middle-
class households in Europe, being something of a frivolous novelty. Early
methods of manufacture employed poisonous lead solder for sealing the cans.
Studies in the 1980s attributed the lead from the cans as a factor in the
disastrous outcome of the 1845 Franklin_expedition to chart and navigate the
Northwest_Passage.[8] Later studies found this to be false.[9]
Increasing mechanization of the canning process, coupled with a huge increase
in urban populations across Europe, resulted in a rising demand for canned
food. A number of inventions and improvements followed, and by the 1860s
smaller machine-made steel cans were possible, and the time to cook food in
sealed cans had been reduced from around six hours to thirty minutes.
**** In the United States[edit] ****

Canned food also began to spread beyond Europe – Robert Ayars established the
first American canning factory in New_York_City in 1812, using improved tin-
plated wrought-iron cans for preserving oysters, meats, fruits and vegetables.
Demand for canned food greatly increased during wars. Large-scale wars in the
nineteenth century, such as the Crimean_War, American_Civil_War, and Franco-
Prussian_War introduced increasing numbers of working-class men to canned food,
and allowed canning companies to expand their businesses to meet military
demands for non-perishable food, allowing companies to manufacture in bulk and
sell to wider civilian markets after wars ended. Urban populations in Victorian
Britain demanded ever-increasing quantities of cheap, varied, quality food that
they could keep at home without having to go shopping daily. In response,
companies such as Underwood, NestlÃ©, Heinz, and others provided quality canned
food for sale to working_class city-dwellers. In particular, Crosse_and
Blackwell took over the concern of Donkin Hall and Gamble. The late 19th
century saw the range of canned food available to urban populations greatly
increase, as canners competed with each other using novel foodstuffs, highly
decorated printed labels, and lower prices.
**** World War I[edit] ****
Demand for canned food skyrocketed during World_War_I, as military commanders
sought vast quantities of cheap, high-calorie food to feed their millions of
soldiers, which could be transported safely, survive trench conditions, and not
spoil in transport. Throughout the war, British soldiers generally subsisted on
low-quality canned foodstuffs, such as the British "Bully Beef" (cheap corned
beef), pork_and_beans, canned sausages, and Maconochies_Irish_Stew, but by
1916, widespread dissatisfaction and increasing complaints about the cheap
canned food amongst soldiers resulted in militaries purchasing better-quality
food to improve morale, and complete meals-in-a-can began to appear. In 1917,
the French_Army began issuing canned French_cuisine, such as coq_au_vin, Beef
Bourguignon and Vichyssoise while the Italian_Army experimented with canned
ravioli, spaghetti_bolognese, Minestrone and Pasta_e_fagioli. Shortages of
canned food in the British_Army in 1917 led to the government issuing
cigarettes and amphetamines to soldiers to suppress their appetites. After the
war, companies that had supplied military canned food improved the quality of
their goods for civilian sale.
***** Methods[edit] *****
The original fragile and heavy glass containers presented challenges for
transportation, and glass jars were largely replaced in commercial canneries
with cylindrical tin_can or wrought-iron canisters (later shortened to "cans")
following the work of Peter_Durand (1810). Cans are cheaper and quicker to
make, and much less fragile than glass jars. Glass jars have remained popular
for some high-value products and in home_canning. Can_openers were not invented
for another thirty years â at first, soldiers had to cut the cans open with
bayonets or smash them open with rocks.[citation_needed] Today, tin-coated
steel is the material most commonly used. Laminate_vacuum_pouches are also used
for canning, such as used in MREs and Capri_Sun drinks.
To prevent the food from being spoiled before and during containment, a number
of methods are used: pasteurisation, boiling (and other applications of high
temperature over a period of time), refrigeration, freezing, drying, vacuum
treatment, antimicrobial agents that are natural to the recipe of the foods
being preserved, a sufficient dose of ionizing radiation, submersion in a
strong saline solution, acid, base, osmotically extreme (for example very
sugary) or other microbially-challenging environments.
Other than sterilization, no method is perfectly dependable as a preservative.
For example, the microorganism Clostridium_botulinum (which causes botulism)
can be eliminated only at temperatures above the boiling point of water.
From a public safety point of view, foods with low acidity (a pH more than 4.6)
need sterilization under high temperature (116â130 Â°C). To achieve
temperatures above the boiling point requires the use of a pressure_canner.
Foods that must be pressure canned include most vegetables, meat, seafood,
poultry, and dairy products. The only foods that may be safely canned in an
ordinary boiling water bath are highly acidic ones with a pH below 4.6,[10]
such as fruits, pickled vegetables, or other foods to which acidic additives
have been added.
**** Double seams[edit] ****
Invented in 1888 by Max Ams,[11] modern double_seams provide an airtight seal
to the tin_can. This airtight nature is crucial to keeping micro-organisms out
of the can and keeping its contents sealed inside. Thus, double seamed cans are
also known as Sanitary Cans. Developed in 1900 in Europe, this sort of can was
made of the traditional cylindrical body made with tin_plate. The two ends
(lids) were attached using what is now called a double seam. A can thus sealed
is impervious to contamination by creating two tight continuous folds between
the can's cylindrical body and the lids. This eliminated the need for solder
and allowed improvements in manufacturing speed, reducing cost.
Double seaming uses rollers to shape the can, lid and the final double seam. To
make a sanitary can and lid suitable for double seaming, manufacture begins
with a sheet of coated tin plate. To create the can body, rectangles are cut
and curled around a die, and welded together creating a cylinder with a side
seam.
Rollers are then used to flare out one or both ends of the cylinder to create a
quarter circle flange around the circumference. Precision is required to ensure
that the welded sides are perfectly aligned, as any misalignment will cause
inconsistent flange shape, compromising its integrity.
A circle is then cut from the sheet using a die cutter. The circle is shaped in
a stamping press to create a downward countersink to fit snugly into the can
body. The result can be compared to an upside down and very flat top_hat. The
outer edge is then curled down and around about 140 degrees using rollers to
create the end curl.
The result is a steel tube with a flanged edge, and a countersunk steel disc
with a curled edge. A rubber compound is put inside the curl.
*** Seaming[edit] ***
See also: Can_seamer
Opened can
The body and end are brought together in a seamer and held in place by the base
plate and chuck, respectively. The base plate provides a sure footing for the
can body during the seaming operation and the chuck fits snugly into the end
(lid). The result is the countersink of the end sits inside the top of the can
body just below the flange. The end curl protrudes slightly beyond the flange.
*** First operation[edit] ***
Once brought together in the seamer, the seaming head presses a first operation
roller against the end curl. The end curl is pressed against the flange curling
it in toward the body and under the flange. The flange is also bent downward,
and the end and body are now loosely joined together. The first operation
roller is then retracted. At this point five thicknesses of steel exist in the
seam. From the outside in they are:
    * End
    * Flange
    * End Curl
    * Body
    * Countersink
*** Second operation[edit] ***
The seaming head then engages the second operation roller against the partly
formed seam. The second operation presses all five steel components together
tightly to form the final seal. The five layers in the final seam are then
called; a) End, b) Body Hook, c) Cover Hook, d) Body, e) Countersink. All
sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the
metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal. In most cases, a
rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical
seal between the end and the body.
Probably the most important innovation since the introduction of double seams
is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded
and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam. The thick side
seam required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more
metal to curl around before closing in behind the Body Hook or flange, with a
greater opportunity for error.
*** Seamer setup and quality assurance[edit] ***
Many different parts during the seaming process are critical in ensuring that a
can is airtight and vacuum sealed. The dangers of a can that is not
hermetically sealed are contamination by foreign objects (bacteria or fungicide
sprays), or that the can could leak or spoil.
One important part is the seamer setup. This process is usually performed by an
experienced technician. Amongst the parts that need setup are seamer rolls and
chucks which have to be set in their exact position (using a feeler gauge or a
clearance_gauge). The lifter pressure and position, roll and chuck designs,
tooling wear, and bearing wear all contribute to a good double_seam.
Incorrect setups can be non-intuitive. For example, due to the springback
effect, a seam can appear loose, when in reality it was closed too tight and
has opened up like a spring. For this reason, experienced operators and good
seamer setup are critical to ensure that double seams are properly closed.
Quality control usually involves taking full cans from the line â one per
seamer head, at least once or twice per shift, and performing a teardown
operation (wrinkle/tightness), mechanical tests (external thickness, seamer
length/height and countersink) as well as cutting the seam open with a twin
blade saw and measuring with a double seam inspection system. The combination
of these measurements will determine the seam's quality.
Use of a statistical_process_control (SPC) software in conjunction with a
manual double-seam monitor, computerized double seam scanner, or even a fully
automatic double seam inspection system makes the laborious process of double
seam inspection faster and much more accurate. Statistically tracking the
performance of each head or seaming station of the can_seamer allows for better
prediction of can seamer issues, and may be used to plan maintenance when
convenient, rather than to simply react after bad or unsafe cans have been
produced.[12]
***** Nutritional value[edit] *****
Canning is a way of processing food to extend its shelf_life. The idea is to
make food available and edible long after the processing time. A 1997 study
found that canned fruits and vegetables are as rich with dietary_fiber and
vitamins as the same corresponding fresh or frozen foods, and in some cases the
canned products are richer than their fresh or frozen counterparts.[13] The
heating process during canning appears to make dietary fiber more soluble, and
therefore more readily fermented in the colon into gases and physiologically
active byproducts. Canned tomatoes have a higher available lycopene content.
Consequently, canned meat and vegetables are often among the list of food items
that are stocked during emergencies.[14]
***** Potential hazards[edit] *****

Women working in a cannery
In the beginning of the 19th century the process of canning foods was mainly
done by small canneries. These canneries were full of overlooked sanitation
problems, such as poor hygiene and unsanitary work environments. Since the
refrigerator did not exist and industrial canning standards were not set in
place it was very common for contaminated cans to slip onto the grocery store
shelves. [15]
**** Migration of can components[edit] ****
In canning toxicology, migration is the movement of substances from the can
itself into the contents.[16] Potential toxic substances that can migrate are
lead, causing lead_poisoning, or bisphenol_A (BPA), a potential endocrine
disruptor that is an ingredient in the epoxy commonly used to coat the inner
surface of cans. Some cans are manufactured with a BPA-free enamel lining
produced from plant oils and resins.[17] On 20 February 2018, Packaging Digest
reported that "At least 90%" of food cans no longer contained BPA.[18]
**** Salt content[edit] ****
Salt (sodium chloride), dissolved in water, is used in the canning process.[19]
As a result, canned food can be a major source of dietary salt.[20] Too much
salt increases the risk of health problems, including high_blood_pressure.
Therefore, health authorities have recommended limitations of dietary sodium.
[21][22][23][24][25] Many canned products are available in low-salt and no-salt
alternatives.
Rinsing thoroughly after opening may reduce the amount of salt in canned foods,
since much of the salt content is thought to be in the liquid, rather than the
food itself.[26]
**** Botulism[edit] ****
Further information: Botulism_Â§ Prevention
Foodborne botulism results from contaminated foodstuffs in which C._botulinum
spores have been allowed to germinate and produce botulism toxin,[27] and this
typically occurs in canned non-acidic food substances that have not received a
strong enough thermal heat treatment. C. botulinum prefers low oxygen
environments and is a poor competitor to other bacteria, but its spores are
resistant to thermal treatments. When a canned food is sterilized
insufficiently, most other bacteria besides the C. botulinum spores are killed,
and the spores can germinate and produce botulism toxin.[27] Botulism is a rare
but serious paralytic illness, leading to paralysis that typically starts with
the muscles of the face and then spreads towards the limbs.[28] The botulinum
toxin is extremely dangerous because it cannot be detected by sight or smell,
and ingestion of even a small amount of the toxin can be deadly.[29] In severe
forms, it leads to paralysis of the breathing muscles and causes respiratory
failure. In view of this life-threatening complication, all suspected cases of
botulism are treated as medical_emergencies, and public_health officials are
usually involved to prevent further cases from the same source.[28]
***** Canning and economic recession[edit] *****
Further information: Recession
Canned goods and canning supplies sell particularly well in times of recession
due to the tendency of financially stressed individuals to engage in cocooning,
a term used by retail analysts to describe the phenomenon in which people
choose to stay at home instead of adding expenditures to their budget by dining
out and socializing outside the home.
In February 2009 during a recession, the United States saw an 11.5% rise in
sales of canning-related items.[30]
Some communities in the US have county canning centers which are available for
teaching canning, or shared community kitchens which can be rented for canning
one's own foods.[31]
***** In popular culture[edit] *****
There was a 1956 US documentary The Miracle of the Can that mentions the Pea
Tenderomiter for the canning trade.[32]
