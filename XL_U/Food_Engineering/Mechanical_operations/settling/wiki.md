Settling pond for iron particles at water works
Settling is the process by which particulates settle to the bottom of a liquid
and form a sediment. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity
or due to centrifugal_motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the
direction exerted by that force. For gravity settling, this means that the
particles will tend to fall to the bottom of the vessel, forming a slurry at
the vessel base.
Settling is an important operation in many applications, such as mining,
wastewater treatment, biological science, space propellant reignition,[1] and
scooping.

***** Physics[edit] *****
Creeping flow past a sphere: streamlines, drag force Fd and force by gravity
Fg.
For settling particles that are considered individually, i.e. dilute particle
solutions, there are two main forces enacting upon any particle. The primary
force is an applied force, such as gravity, and a drag force that is due to the
motion of the particle through the fluid. The applied force is usually not
affected by the particle's velocity, whereas the drag force is a function of
the particle velocity.
For a particle at rest no drag force will be exhibited, which causes the
particle to accelerate due to the applied force. When the particle accelerates,
the drag force acts in the direction opposite to the particle's motion,
retarding further acceleration, in the absence of other forces drag directly
opposes the applied force. As the particle increases in velocity eventually the
drag force and the applied force will approximately_equate, causing no further
change in the particle's velocity. This velocity is known as the terminal
velocity, settling velocity or fall velocity of the particle. This is readily
measurable by examining the rate of fall of individual particles.
The terminal velocity of the particle is affected by many parameters, i.e.
anything that will alter the particle's drag. Hence the terminal velocity is
most notably dependent upon grain_size, the shape (roundness and sphericity)
and density of the grains, as well as to the viscosity and density of the
fluid.
**** Single particle drag[edit] ****
*** Stokes' drag[edit] ***
Main article: Stokes'_law
Dimensionless force versus Reynolds number for spherical particles
For dilute suspensions, Stokes'_law predicts the settling velocity of small
spheres in fluid, either air or water. This originates due to the strength of
viscous forces at the surface of the particle providing the majority of the
retarding force. Stokes' law finds many applications in the natural sciences,
and is given by:
         w =    2 (  &#x03C1;  p   &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  f   ) g  r  2     9
      &#x03BC;      {\displaystyle w={\frac {2(\rho _{p}-\rho _{f})gr^{2}}{9\mu
      }}}  [w={\frac  {2(\rho _{p}-\rho _{f})gr^{2}}{9\mu }}]
where w is the settling velocity, Ï is density (the subscripts p and f
indicate particle and fluid respectively), g is the acceleration due to
gravity, r is the radius of the particle and Î¼ is the dynamic viscosity of the
fluid.
Stokes' law applies when the Reynolds_number, Re, of the particle is less than
0.1. Experimentally Stokes' law is found to hold within 1% for     R e &#x2264;
0.1   {\displaystyle Re\leq 0.1}  [Re\leq 0.1], within 3% for     R e &#x2264;
0.5   {\displaystyle Re\leq 0.5}  [Re\leq 0.5] and within 9%     R e &#x2264;
1.0   {\displaystyle Re\leq 1.0}  [Re\leq 1.0].[2] With increasing Reynolds
numbers, Stokes law begins to break down due to the increasing importance of
fluid inertia, requiring the use of empirical solutions to calculate drag
forces.
*** Newtonian drag[edit] ***
Defining a drag_coefficient,      C  d     {\displaystyle C_{d}}  [C_{d}], as
the ratio of the force experienced by the particle divided by the impact
pressure of the fluid, a coefficient that can be considered as the transfer of
available fluid force into drag is established. In this region the inertia of
the impacting fluid is responsible for the majority of force transfer to the
particle.
          C  d   =    F  d      1 2    &#x03C1;  f    U  2   A
      {\displaystyle C_{d}={\frac {F_{d}}{{\frac {1}{2}}\rho _{f}U^{2}A}}}  [C_
      {d}={\frac  {F_{d}}{{\frac  {1}{2}}\rho _{f}U^{2}A}}]
For a spherical particle in the Stokes regime this value is not constant,
however in the Newtonian drag regime the drag on a sphere can be approximated
by a constant, 0.44. This constant value implies that the efficiency of
transfer of energy from the fluid to the particle is not a function of fluid
velocity.
As such the terminal_velocity of a particle in a Newtonian regime can again be
obtained by equating the drag force to the applied force, resulting in the
following expression
         w = 2.46   (    (  &#x03C1;  p   &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  f   ) g r
      &#x03C1;  f     )    1 2    .   {\displaystyle w=2.46\left({\frac {(\rho
      _{p}-\rho _{f})gr}{\rho _{f}}}\right)^{\frac {1}{2}}.}  [w=2.46\left(
      {\frac  {(\rho _{p}-\rho _{f})gr}{\rho _{f}}}\right)^{{{\frac  {1}
      {2}}}}.]
*** Transitional drag[edit] ***
In the intermediate region between Stokes drag and Newtonian drag, there exists
a transitional regime, where the analytical solution to the problem of a
falling sphere becomes problematic. To solve this, empirical expressions are
used to calculate drag in this region. One such empirical equation is that of
Schiller and Naumann, and may be valid for     0.2 &#x2264; R e &#x2264; 1000
{\displaystyle 0.2\leq Re\leq 1000}  [0.2\leq Re\leq 1000]:[3]
           F   &#x03C1;  f    U  2   A    =   12  R e     (  1 + 0.15   R e
      0.687    )  .   {\displaystyle {\frac {F}{\rho _{f}U^{2}A}}={\frac {12}
      {\mathrm {Re} }}\left(1+0.15\mathrm {Re} ^{0.687}\right).}  [{\frac  {F}
      {\rho _{f}U^{2}A}}={\frac  {12}{{\mathrm  {Re}}}}\left(1+0.15{\mathrm
      {Re}}^{{0.687}}\right).]
**** Hindered settling[edit] ****
Stokes, transitional and Newtonian settling describe the behaviour of a single
spherical particle in an infinite fluid, known as free settling. However this
model has limitations in practical application. Alternate considerations, such
as the interaction of particles in the fluid, or the interaction of the
particles with the container walls can modify the settling behaviour. Settling
that has these forces in appreciable magnitude is known as hindered settling.
Subsequently semi-analytic or empirical solutions may be used to perform
meaningful hindered settling calculations.
***** Applications[edit] *****
The solid-gas flow systems are present in many industrial applications, as dry,
catalytic reactors, settling tanks, pneumatic conveying of solids, among
others. Obviously, in industrial operations the drag rule is not simple as a
single sphere settling in a stationary fluid. However, this knowledge indicates
how drag behaves in more complex systems, which are designed and studied by
engineers applying empirical and more sophisticated tools.
For example, Settling tanks are used for separating solids and/or oil from
another liquid. In food_processing, the vegetable is crushed and placed inside
of a settling tank with water. The oil floats the top of the water then is
collected. In water and waste water_treatment a flocculant is often added prior
to settling to form larger particles that settle out quickly in a settling tank
or an inclined_plate_settler, leaving the water with a lower turbidity.
In winemaking, the French term for this process is dÃ©bourbage. This step
usually occurs in white wine production before the start of fermentation.[4]
**** Settleable solids analysis[edit] ****
Settleable solids are the particulates that settle out of a still fluid.
Settleable solids can be quantified for a suspension using an Imhoff cone. The
standard Imhoff cone of transparent glass or plastic holds one liter of liquid
and has calibrated markings to measure the volume of solids accumulated in the
bottom of the conical container after settling for one hour. A standardized
Imhoff cone procedure is commonly used to measure suspended solids in
wastewater or stormwater_runoff. The simplicity of the method makes it popular
for estimating water_quality. To numerically gauge the stablity of suspended
solids and predict agglomeration and sedimentation events, zeta_potential is
commonly analyzed. This parameter indicates the electrostatic repulsion between
solid particles and can be used to predict whether aggregation and settling
will occur over time.
The water sample to be measured should be representative of the total stream.
Samples are best collected from the discharge falling from a pipe or over a
weir, because samples skimmed from the top of a flowing channel may fail to
capture larger, high-density solids moving along the bottom of the channel. The
sampling bucket is vigorously stirred to uniformly re-suspend all collected
solids immediately before pouring the volume required to fill the cone. The
filled cone is immediately placed in a stationary holding rack to allow
quiescent settling. The rack should be located away from heating sources,
including direct sunlight, which might cause currents within the cone from
thermal density changes of the liquid contents. After 45 minutes of settling,
the cone is partially rotated about its axis of symmetry just enough to
dislodge any settled material adhering to the side of the cone. Accumulated
sediment is observed and measured fifteen minutes later, after one hour of
total settling time.[5]
