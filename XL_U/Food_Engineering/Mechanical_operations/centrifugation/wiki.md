Centrifugation is a technique which involves the application of centrifugal
force to separate particles from a solution according to their size, shape,
density, viscosity of the medium and rotor speed.[1] This process is used to
separate two miscible substances, but also to analyze the hydrodynamic
properties of macromolecules.[2] More-dense components of the mixture migrate
away from the axis of the centrifuge (move to the outside), while less-dense
components of the mixture migrate towards the axis, i. e., move to the center.
Chemists and biologists may increase the effective gravitational force on a
test tube so as to more rapidly and completely cause the precipitate (pellet)
to gather on the bottom of the tube. The remaining solution (supernatant) may
be discarded with a pipette.[citation_needed]. Centrifugation of protein
solution, for example, allows elimination of impurities into the supernatant.
There is a correlation between the size and density of a particle and the rate
that the particle separates from a heterogeneous mixture, when the only force
applied is that of gravity. The larger the size and the larger the density of
the particles, the faster they separate from the mixture. By applying a larger
effective gravitational force to the mixture, like a centrifuge does, the
separation of the particles is accelerated. This is ideal in industrial and lab
settings because particles that would naturally separate over a long period of
time can be separated in much less time.[3]
The rate of centrifugation is specified by the angular_velocity usually
expressed as revolutions_per_minute (RPM), or acceleration expressed as g. The
conversion factor between RPM and g depends on the radius of the centrifuge
rotor. The particles' settling velocity in centrifugation is a function of
their size and shape, centrifugal acceleration, the volume fraction of solids
present, the density difference between the particle and the liquid, and the
viscosity. The most common application is the separation of solid from highly
concentrated suspensions, which is used in the treatment of sewage sludges for
dewatering where less consistent sediment is produced.[4]
In the chemical and food industries, special centrifuges can process_a
continuous_stream of particle-laden liquid.
Centrifugation is the most common method used for uranium_enrichment, relying
on the slight mass difference between atoms of U238 and U235 in uranium
hexafluoride gas.[citation_needed].

***** Mathematical formula[edit] *****
The general formula for calculating the revolutions per minute (RPM) of a
centrifuge is
   R P M =    g r      {\displaystyle RPM={\sqrt {g \over r}}}  [{\displaystyle
RPM={\sqrt {g \over r}}}],
where g represents the respective force of the centrifuge and r the radius from
the center of the rotor to a point in the sample.[5] However, depending on the
centrifuge model used, the respective angle of the rotor and the radius may
vary, thus the formula gets modified. For example, the Sorvall #SS-34 rotor has
a maximum radius of 10.8 cm, so the formula becomes     R P M = 299    g r
{\displaystyle RPM=299{\sqrt {g \over r}}}  [{\displaystyle RPM=299{\sqrt {g
\over r}}}], which can further simplify to     R P M = 91   g
{\displaystyle RPM=91{\sqrt {g}}}  [{\displaystyle RPM=91{\sqrt {g}}}].[6] the
applied centrifugation field is square angular velocity in radians per sec .the
radial distance o the particle from the axis;
The most common formula used for calculating Relative Centrifugal Force (x g)
is: RCF (x g) = 1.118 x Radius (mm) x (rpm/1000)Â²
Many clinical separations have historically been carried out at 3000 rpm. This
is a somewhat arbitrary approach as the RCF applied is dependent upon the
radius in a linear fashion - so a 10% larger radius means that a 10% higher RCF
is applied at the same speed. To discover the RCF that you have been applying
at 3000 rpm, the above formula can be simplified to:
[Short cut for 3000 rpm, with only a 0.62% error:] RCF (x g) = 10 x Radius (mm)
***** Centrifugation in biological research[edit] *****
**** Microcentrifuges[edit] ****
Microcentrifuges are used to process small volumes of biological molecules,
cells, or nuclei. Microcentrifuge tubes generally hold 0.5 - 2.0 mL of liquid,
and are spun at maximum angular speeds of 12,000â13,000 rpm. Microcentrifuges
are small enough to fit on a table-top and have rotors that can quickly change
speeds. They may or may not have a refrigeration function.
**** High-speed centrifuges[edit] ****
High-speed or superspeed centrifuges can handle larger sample volumes, from a
few tens of millilitres to several litres. Additionally, larger centrifuges can
also reach higher angular velocities (around 30,000 rpm). The rotors may come
with different adapters to hold various sizes of test_tubes, bottles, or
microtiter_plates.
**** Fractionation process[edit] ****
General method of fractionation: Cell sample is stored in a suspension which
is:
   1. Buffered - neutral pH, preventing damage to the structure of proteins
      including enzymes (which could affect ionic bonds)
   2. Isotonic (of equal water potential) - this prevents water gain or loss by
      the organelles
   3. Cool - reducing the overall activity of enzyme released later in the
      procedure
    * Cells are homogenised in a blender and filtered to remove debris
    * The homogenised sample is placed in an ultracentrifuge and spun in low
      speed - nuclei settle out, forming a pellet
    * The supernatant (suspension containing remaining organelles) is spun at a
      higher speed - chloroplasts settle out
    * The supernatant is spun at a higher speed still - mitochondria and
      lysosomes settle out
    * The supernatant is spun at an even higher speed - ribosomes, membranes
      settle out
The ribosomes, membranes and Golgi complexes can be separated by another
technique called density gradient centrifugation.
**** Ultracentrifugations[edit] ****
Main articles: Differential_centrifugation, Isopycnic_centrifugation, and
ultracentrifugation
Ultracentrifugation makes use of high centrifugal force for studying properties
of biological particles. Compared to microcentrifuges or high-speed
centrifuges, ultracentrifuges can isolate much smaller particles, including
ribosomes, proteins, and viruses. Ultracentrifuges can also be used in the
study of membrane fractionation. This occurs because ultracentrifuges can reach
maximum angular velocities in excess of 70,000 rpm. Additionally, while
microcentrifuges and supercentrifuges separate particles in batches (limited
volumes of samples must be handled manually in test tubes or bottles),
ultracentrifuges can separate molecules in batch or continuous flow systems.
In addition to purification, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) can be used
for determination of the properties of macromolecules such as shape, mass,
composition, and conformation. Samples are centrifuged with a high-density
solution such as sucrose, caesium_chloride, or iodixanol. The high-density
solution may be at a uniform concentration throughout the test tube ("cushion")
or a varying concentration ("gradient"). Molecular properties can be modeled
through sedimentation velocity analysis or sedimentation equilibrium analysis.
During the run, the particle or molecules will migrate through the test tube at
different speeds depending on their physical properties and the properties of
the solution, and eventually form a pellet at the bottom of the tube, or bands
at various heights.
**** Density Gradient Centrifugation[edit] ****
Density gradient centrifugation is considered one of the more efficient methods
of separating suspended particles. Density gradient centrifugation can be used
both as a separation technique and as a method of measuring the densities of
particles or molecules in a mixture.[7] A tube, after being centrifuged by this
method, has particles in order of density based on height. The object or
particle of interest will reside in the position within the tube corresponding
to its density.[8]
Linderstorm-Lang, in 1937, discovered that density gradient tubes could be used
for density measurements. He discovered this when working with potato yellow-
dwarf virus.[7]
This method was also used in Meselson and Stahl's famous experiment in which
they proved that DNA replication is semi-conservative by using different
isotopes of nitrogen. They used density gradient centrifugation to determine
which isotope or isotopes of nitrogen were present in the DNA after cycles of
replication.[8]
Nevertheless, some non-ideal sedimentations are still possible when using this
method. The first potential issue is the unwanted aggregation of particles, but
this can occur in any centrifugation. The second possibility occurs when
droplets of solution that contain particles sediment. This is more likely to
occur when working with a solution that has a layer of suspension floating on a
dense liquid, which in fact have little to no density gradient.[7]
**** Differential Centrifugation[edit] ****
Differential Centrifugation is a type of centrifugation in which one
selectively spins down components of a mixture by a series of increasing
centrifugation forces. This method is commonly used to separate organelles and
membranes found in cells. Organelles generally differ from each other in
density in size, making the use of differential centrifugation, and
centrifugation in general, possible. The organelles can then be identified by
testing for indicators that are unique to the specific organelles.[9]

***** History[edit] *****
By 1923 Theodor_Svedberg and his student H. Rinde had successfully analyzed
large-grained sols in terms of their gravitational sedimentation.[11] Sols
consist of a substance evenly distributed in another substance, also known as a
colloid.[12] However, smaller grained sols, such as those containing gold,
could not be analyzed.[11] To investigate this problem Svedberg developed an
analytical centrifuge, equipped with a photographic absorption system, which
would exert a much greater centrifugal effect.[11] In addition, he developed
the theory necessary to measure molecular weight.[12] During this time,
Svedberg's attention shifted from gold to proteins.[11]
By 1900, it had been generally accepted that proteins were composed of amino
acids; however, whether proteins were colloids or macromolecules was still
under debate.[13] One protein being investigated at the time was hemoglobin. It
was determined to have 712 carbon, 1,130 hydrogen, 243 oxygen, two sulfur
atoms, and at least one iron atom. This gave hemoglobin a resulting weight of
approximately 16,000 dalton (Da) but it was uncertain whether this value was a
multiple of one or four (dependent upon the number of iron atoms present).[14]
Through a series of experiments utilizing the sedimentation_equilibrium
technique, two important observations were made: hemoglobin has a molecular
weight of 68,000 Da, suggesting that there are four iron atoms present rather
than one, and that no matter where the hemoglobin was isolated from, it had
exactly the same molecular weight.[11][12] How something of such a large
molecular mass could be consistently found, regardless of where it was sampled
from in the body, was unprecedented and favored the idea that proteins are
macromolecules rather than colloids.[13] In order to investigate this
phenomenon, a centrifuge with even higher speeds was needed, and thus the
ultracentrifuge was created to apply the theory of sedimentation-diffusion.[11]
The same molecular mass was determined, and the presence of a spreading
boundary suggested that it was a single compact particle.[11] Further
application of centrifugation showed that under different conditions the large
homogeneous particles could be broken down into discrete subunits.[11] The
development of centrifugation was a great advance in experimental protein
science.
