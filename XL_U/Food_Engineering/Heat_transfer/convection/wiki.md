This figure shows a calculation for thermal convection in the Earth's_mantle.
Colors closer to red are hot areas and colors closer to blue are in warm and
cold areas. A hot, less-dense lower boundary layer sends plumes of hot material
upwards, and likewise, cold material from the top moves downwards.
Convection is the heat transfer due to the bulk movement of molecules within
fluids such as gases and liquids, including molten rock (rheid). Convection
includes sub-mechanisms of advection (directional bulk-flow transfer of heat),
and diffusion (non-directional transfer of energy or mass particles along a
concentration gradient).
Thermal image of a newly lit Ghillie_kettle. The plume of hot air resulting
from the convection current is visible.
Convection cannot take place in most solids because neither bulk current flows
nor significant diffusion of matter can take place. Diffusion of heat takes
place in rigid solids, but that is called heat_conduction. Convection,
additionally may take place in soft solids or mixtures where solid particles
can move past each other.
Thermal convection can be demonstrated by placing a heat source (e.g. a Bunsen
burner) at the side of a glass filled with a liquid, and observing the changes
in temperature in the glass caused by the warmer fluid circulating into cooler
areas.
Convective_heat_transfer is one of the major types of heat_transfer, and
convection is also a major mode of mass_transfer in fluids. Convective heat and
mass transfer takes place both by diffusion â the random Brownian_motion of
individual particles in the fluid â and by advection, in which matter or heat
is transported by the larger-scale motion of currents in the fluid. In the
context of heat and mass transfer, the term "convection" is used to refer to
the combined effects of advective and diffusive transfer.[1] Sometimes the term
"convection" is used to refer specifically to "free_heat_convection" (natural
heat convection) where bulk-flow in a fluid is due to temperature-induced
differences in buoyancy, as opposed to "forced heat convection" where forces
other than buoyancy (such as pump or fan) move the fluid. However, in
mechanics, the correct use of the word "convection" is the more general sense,
and different types of convection should be further qualified, for clarity.
Convection can be qualified in terms of being natural, forced, gravitational,
granular, or thermomagnetic. It may also be said to be due to combustion,
capillary_action, or Marangoni and Weissenberg_effects. Heat transfer by
natural convection plays a role in the structure of Earth's_atmosphere, its
oceans, and its mantle. Discrete convective cells in the atmosphere can be seen
as clouds, with stronger convection resulting in thunderstorms. Natural
convection also plays a role in stellar physics.
The convection mechanism is also used in cooking, when using a convection_oven,
which uses fans to circulate hot air around food in order to cook the food
faster than a conventional oven.

***** Terminology[edit] *****
The word convection may have slightly different but related usages in different
scientific or engineering contexts or applications. The broader sense is in
fluid_mechanics, where convection refers to the motion of fluid regardless of
cause.[2][3] However, in thermodynamics "convection" often refers specifically
to heat transfer by convection.[4]
***** Examples and applications of convection[edit] *****
Convection occurs on a large scale in atmospheres, oceans, planetary mantles,
and it provides the mechanism of heat transfer for a large fraction of the
outermost interiors of our sun and all stars. Fluid movement during convection
may be invisibly slow, or it may be obvious and rapid, as in a hurricane. On
astronomical scales, convection of gas and dust is thought to occur in the
accretion disks of black_holes, at speeds which may closely approach that of
light.
**** Heat transfer[edit] ****
Main article: Convective_heat_transfer
A heat_sink provides a large surface area for convection to efficiently carry
away heat.
Convective heat transfer is a mechanism of heat_transfer occurring because of
bulk motion (observable movement) of fluids.[5] Heat is the entity of interest
being advected (carried), and diffused (dispersed). This can be contrasted with
conductive heat transfer, which is the transfer of energy by vibrations at a
molecular level through a solid or fluid, and radiative_heat_transfer, the
transfer of energy through electromagnetic_waves.
Heat is transferred by convection in numerous examples of naturally occurring
fluid flow, such as wind, oceanic currents, and movements within the Earth's
mantle. Convection is also used in engineering practices of homes, industrial
processes, cooling of equipment, etc.
The rate of convective heat transfer may be improved by the use of a heat_sink,
often in conjunction with a fan. For instance, a typical computer CPU will have
a purpose-made fan to ensure its operating_temperature is kept within tolerable
limits.
**** Convection cells[edit] ****
Main article: Convection_cell
Convection cells in a gravity field
A convection cell, also known as a BÃ©nard_cell is a characteristic fluid flow
pattern in many convection systems. A rising body of fluid typically loses heat
because it encounters a colder surface. In liquid, this occurs because it
exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange. In the example of
the Earth's atmosphere, this occurs because it radiates heat. Because of this
heat loss the fluid becomes denser than the fluid underneath it, which is still
rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side.
At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and
the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again and the cycle
repeats itself.
**** Atmospheric circulation[edit] ****
Main article: Atmospheric_circulation
Idealised depiction of the global circulation on Earth
Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air, and is a means by
which thermal energy is distributed on the surface of the Earth, together with
the much slower (lagged) ocean circulation system. The large-scale structure of
the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic
climatological structure remains fairly constant.
Latitudinal circulation occurs because incident solar radiation per unit area
is highest at the heat_equator, and decreases as the latitude increases,
reaching minima at the poles. It consists of two primary convection cells, the
Hadley_cell and the polar_vortex, with the Hadley_cell experiencing stronger
convection due to the release of latent_heat energy by condensation of water
vapor at higher altitudes during cloud formation.
Longitudinal circulation, on the other hand, comes about because the ocean has
a higher specific heat capacity than land (and also thermal conductivity,
allowing the heat to penetrate further beneath the surface ) and thereby
absorbs and releases more heat, but the temperature changes less than land.
This brings the sea breeze, air cooled by the water, ashore in the day, and
carries the land breeze, air cooled by contact with the ground, out to sea
during the night. Longitudinal circulation consists of two cells, the Walker
circulation and El_NiÃ±o_/_Southern_Oscillation.
**** Weather[edit] ****
See also: Cloud, Thunderstorm, and Wind
How Foehn is produced
Some more localized phenomena than global atmospheric movement are also due to
convection, including wind and some of the hydrologic_cycle. For example, a
foehn_wind is a down-slope wind which occurs on the downwind side of a mountain
range. It results from the adiabatic warming of air which has dropped most of
its moisture on windward slopes.[6] Because of the different adiabatic lapse
rates of moist and dry air, the air on the leeward slopes becomes warmer than
at the same height on the windward slopes.
A thermal_column (or thermal) is a vertical section of rising air in the lower
altitudes of the Earth's atmosphere. Thermals are created by the uneven heating
of the Earth's surface from solar radiation. The Sun warms the ground, which in
turn warms the air directly above it. The warmer air expands, becoming less
dense than the surrounding air mass, and creating a thermal_low.[7][8] The mass
of lighter air rises, and as it does, it cools by expansion at lower air
pressures. It stops rising when it has cooled to the same temperature as the
surrounding air. Associated with a thermal is a downward flow surrounding the
thermal column. The downward moving exterior is caused by colder air being
displaced at the top of the thermal. Another convection-driven weather effect
is the sea_breeze.[9][10]
Stages of a thunderstorm's life.
Warm air has a lower density than cool air, so warm air rises within cooler
air,[11] similar to hot_air_balloons.[12] Clouds form as relatively warmer air
carrying moisture rises within cooler air. As the moist air rises, it cools,
causing some of the water_vapor in the rising packet of air to condense.[13]
When the moisture condenses, it releases energy known as latent_heat of
condensation which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than its
surrounding air,[14] continuing the cloud's ascension. If enough instability is
present in the atmosphere, this process will continue long enough for
cumulonimbus_clouds to form, which support lightning and thunder. Generally,
thunderstorms require three conditions to form: moisture, an unstable airmass,
and a lifting force (heat).
All thunderstorms, regardless of type, go through three stages: the developing
stage, the mature stage, and the dissipation stage.[15] The average
thunderstorm has a 24 km (15 mi) diameter. Depending on the conditions present
in the atmosphere, these three stages take an average of 30 minutes to go
through.[16]
**** Oceanic circulation[edit] ****
Main articles: Gulf_Stream and Thermohaline_circulation
Ocean currents
Solar radiation affects the oceans: warm water from the Equator tends to
circulate toward the poles, while cold polar water heads towards the Equator.
The surface currents are initially dictated by surface wind conditions. The
trade_winds blow westward in the tropics,[17] and the westerlies blow eastward
at mid-latitudes.[18] This wind pattern applies a stress to the subtropical
ocean surface with negative curl across the Northern_Hemisphere,[19] and the
reverse across the Southern_Hemisphere. The resulting Sverdrup_transport is
equatorward.[20] Because of conservation of potential_vorticity caused by the
poleward-moving winds on the subtropical_ridge's western periphery and the
increased relative vorticity of poleward moving water, transport is balanced by
a narrow, accelerating poleward current, which flows along the western boundary
of the ocean basin, outweighing the effects of friction with the cold western
boundary current which originates from high latitudes.[21] The overall process,
known as western intensification, causes currents on the western boundary of an
ocean basin to be stronger than those on the eastern boundary.[22]
As it travels poleward, warm water transported by strong warm water current
undergoes evaporative cooling. The cooling is wind driven: wind moving over
water cools the water and also causes evaporation, leaving a saltier brine. In
this process, the water becomes saltier and denser. and decreases in
temperature. Once sea ice forms, salts are left out of the ice, a process known
as brine exclusion.[23] These two processes produce water that is denser and
colder. The water across the northern Atlantic_ocean becomes so dense that it
begins to sink down through less salty and less dense water. (The convective
action is not unlike that of a lava_lamp.) This downdraft of heavy, cold and
dense water becomes a part of the North_Atlantic_Deep_Water, a southgoing
stream.[24]
**** Mantle convection[edit] ****
Main article: Mantle_convection
An oceanic_plate is added to by upwelling (left) and consumed at a subduction
zone (right).
Mantle convection is the slow creeping motion of Earth's rocky mantle caused by
convection currents carrying heat from the interior of the earth to the
surface.[25] It is one of 3 driving forces that causes tectonic plates to move
around the Earth's surface.[26]
The Earth's surface is divided into a number of tectonic plates that are
continuously being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries.
Creation (accretion) occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a plate.
This hot added material cools down by conduction and convection of heat. At the
consumption edges of the plate, the material has thermally contracted to become
dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction at an
ocean trench. This subducted material sinks to some depth in the Earth's
interior where it is prohibited from sinking further. The subducted oceanic
crust triggers volcanism.
**** Stack effect[edit] ****
Main article: Stack_effect
The Stack effect or chimney effect is the movement of air into and out of
buildings, chimneys, flue gas stacks, or other containers due to buoyancy.
Buoyancy occurs due to a difference in indoor-to-outdoor air density resulting
from temperature and moisture differences. The greater the thermal difference
and the height of the structure, the greater the buoyancy force, and thus the
stack effect. The stack effect helps drive natural ventilation and
infiltration. Some cooling_towers operate on this principle; similarly the
solar_updraft_tower is a proposed device to generate electricity based on the
stack effect.
**** Stellar physics[edit] ****
Main articles: Convection_zone and granule_(solar_physics)
An illustration of the structure of the Sun and a red_giant star, showing their
convective zones. These are the granular zones in the outer layers of these
stars.
Granulesâthe tops or upper visible sizes of convection cells, seen on the
photosphere of the Sun. These are caused by the convection in the upper
photosphere of the Sun. North America is superimposed on the same scale, to
indicate scale.
The convection zone of a star is the range of radii in which energy is
transported primarily by convection.
Granules on the photosphere of the Sun are the visible tops of convection cells
in the photosphere, caused by convection of plasma in the photosphere. The
rising part of the granules is located in the center where the plasma is
hotter. The outer edge of the granules is darker due to the cooler descending
plasma. A typical granule has a diameter on the order of 1,000 kilometers and
each lasts 8 to 20 minutes before dissipating. Below the photosphere is a layer
of much larger "supergranules" up to 30,000 kilometers in diameter, with
lifespans of up to 24 hours.
**** Cooking[edit] ****
Main article: Convection_oven
A convection oven is an oven that has fans to circulate air around food, using
the convection mechanism to cook food faster than a conventional oven.[27]
Convection ovens distribute heat evenly around the food, removing the blanket
of cooler air that surrounds food when it is first placed in an oven and
allowing food to cook more evenly in less time and at a lower temperature than
in a conventional oven.[28] A convection oven has a fan with a heating_element
around it. A small fan circulates the air in the cooking chamber.[29][30]
***** Convection mechanisms[edit] *****
Convection may happen in fluids at all scales larger than a few atoms. There
are a variety of circumstances in which the forces required for natural and
forced convection arise, leading to different types of convection, described
below. In broad terms, convection arises because of body_forces acting within
the fluid, such as gravity.
The causes of convection are generally described as one of either "natural"
("free") or "forced", although other mechanisms also exist (discussed below).
However, the distinction between natural and forced convection is particularly
important for convective_heat_transfer.
**** Natural convection[edit] ****
Main article: Natural_convection
This color schlieren image reveals thermal_convection from a human hand (in
silhouette) to the surrounding still atmosphere.
Natural convection, or free convection, occurs due to temperature differences
which affect the density, and thus relative buoyancy, of the fluid. Heavier
(denser) components will fall, while lighter (less dense) components rise,
leading to bulk fluid movement. Natural convection can only occur, therefore,
in a gravitational field. A common example of natural convection is the rise of
smoke from a fire. It can be seen in a pot of boiling water in which the hot
and less-dense water on the bottom layer moves upwards in plumes, and the cool
and more dense water near the top of the pot likewise sinks.
Natural convection will be more likely and more rapid with a greater variation
in density between the two fluids, a larger acceleration due to gravity that
drives the convection or a larger distance through the convecting medium.
Natural convection will be less likely and less rapid with more rapid diffusion
(thereby diffusing away the thermal gradient that is causing the convection) or
a more viscous (sticky) fluid.
The onset of natural convection can be determined by the Rayleigh_number (Ra).
Note that differences in buoyancy within a fluid can arise for reasons other
than temperature variations, in which case the fluid motion is called
gravitational convection (see below). However, all types of buoyant convection,
including natural convection, do not occur in microgravity environments. All
require the presence of an environment which experiences g-force (proper
acceleration).
**** Forced convection[edit] ****
Main article: Forced_convection
In forced convection, also called heat advection, fluid movement results from
external surface_forces such as a fan or pump. Forced convection is typically
used to increase the rate of heat exchange. Many types of mixing also utilize
forced convection to distribute one substance within another. Forced convection
also occurs as a by-product to other processes, such as the action of a
propeller in a fluid or aerodynamic_heating. Fluid radiator systems, and also
heating and cooling of parts of the body by blood circulation, are other
familiar examples of forced convection.
Forced convection may happen by natural means, such as when the heat of a fire
causes expansion of air and bulk air flow by this means. In microgravity, such
flow (which happens in all directions) along with diffusion is the only means
by which fires are able to draw in fresh oxygen to maintain themselves. The
shock wave that transfers heat and mass out of explosions is also a type of
forced convection.
Although forced convection from thermal gas expansion in zero-g does not fuel a
fire as well as natural convection in a gravity field, some types of artificial
forced convection are far more efficient than free convection, as they are not
limited by natural mechanisms. For instance, a convection_oven works by forced
convection, as a fan which rapidly circulates hot air forces heat into food
faster than would naturally happen due to simple heating without the fan.
**** Gravitational or buoyant convection[edit] ****
Gravitational convection is a type of natural convection induced by buoyancy
variations resulting from material properties other than temperature. Typically
this is caused by a variable composition of the fluid. If the varying property
is a concentration gradient, it is known as solutal convection.[31] For
example, gravitational convection can be seen in the diffusion of a source of
dry salt downward into wet soil due to the buoyancy of fresh water in saline.
[32]
Variable salinity in water and variable water content in air masses are
frequent causes of convection in the oceans and atmosphere which do not involve
heat, or else involve additional compositional density factors other than the
density changes from thermal expansion (see thermohaline_circulation).
Similarly, variable composition within the Earth's interior which has not yet
achieved maximal stability and minimal energy (in other words, with densest
parts deepest) continues to cause a fraction of the convection of fluid rock
and molten metal within the Earth's interior (see below).
Gravitational convection, like natural thermal convection, also requires a g-
force environment in order to occur.
**** Granular convection[edit] ****
Main article: Granular_convection
Vibration-induced convection occurs in powders and granulated materials in
containers subject to vibration where an axis of vibration is parallel to the
force of gravity. When the container accelerates upward, the bottom of the
container pushes the entire contents upward. In contrast, when the container
accelerates downward, the sides of the container push the adjacent material
downward by friction, but the material more remote from the sides is less
affected. The net result is a slow circulation of particles downward at the
sides, and upward in the middle.
If the container contains particles of different sizes, the downward-moving
region at the sides is often narrower than the largest particles. Thus, larger
particles tend to become sorted to the top of such a mixture. This is one
possible explanation of the Brazil_nut_effect.
**** Solid-state convection in ice[edit] ****
Ice_convection_on_Pluto is believed to occur in a soft mixture of nitrogen_ice
and carbon_monoxide ice. It has also been proposed for Europa,[33] and other
bodies in the outer solar system.[34]
**** Thermomagnetic convection[edit] ****
Main article: Thermomagnetic_convection
Thermomagnetic convection can occur when an external magnetic field is imposed
on a ferrofluid with varying magnetic_susceptibility. In the presence of a
temperature gradient this results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, which
leads to fluid movement. A ferrofluid is a liquid which becomes strongly
magnetized in the presence of a magnetic_field.
This form of heat transfer can be useful for cases where conventional
convection fails to provide adequate heat transfer, e.g., in miniature
microscale devices or under reduced gravity conditions.
**** Capillary action[edit] ****
Main article: Capillary_action
Capillary action is a phenomenon where liquid spontaneously rises in a narrow
space such as a thin tube, or in porous materials. This effect can cause
liquids to flow against the force of gravity. It occurs because of inter-
molecular attractive forces between the liquid and solid surrounding surfaces;
If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small, then the combination of
surface tension and forces of adhesion between the liquid and container act to
lift the liquid.
**** Marangoni effect[edit] ****
Main article: Marangoni_effect
The Marangoni effect is the convection of fluid along an interface between
dissimilar substances because of variations in surface tension. Surface tension
can vary because of inhomogeneous composition of the substances or the
temperature-dependence of surface tension forces. In the latter case the effect
is known as thermo-capillary convection.
A well-known phenomenon exhibiting this type of convection is the "tears_of
wine".
**** Weissenberg effect[edit] ****
Main article: Weissenberg_effect
See also: Reptation
The Weissenberg effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a spinning rod is
placed into a solution of liquid polymer. Entanglements cause the polymer
chains to be drawn towards the rod instead of being thrown outward as would
happen with an ordinary fluid (i.e., water).[citation_needed]
**** Combustion[edit] ****
In a zero-gravity environment, there can be no buoyancy forces, and thus no
natural (free) convection possible, so flames in many circumstances without
gravity smother in their own waste gases. However, flames may be maintained
with any type of forced convection (breeze); or (in high oxygen environments in
"still" gas environments) entirely from the minimal forced convection that
occurs as heat-induced expansion (not buoyancy) of gases allows for ventilation
of the flame, as waste gases move outward and cool, and fresh high-oxygen gas
moves in to take up the low pressure zones created when flame-exhaust water
condenses.[35]
***** Mathematical models of convection[edit] *****
Mathematically, convection can be described by the convectionâdiffusion
equation, also known as the generic_scalar_transport_equation.
**** Quantifying natural versus forced convection[edit] ****
In cases of mixed convection (natural and forced occurring together) one would
often like to know how much of the convection is due to external constraints,
such as the fluid velocity in the pump, and how much is due to natural
convection occurring in the system.
The relative magnitudes of the Grashof_number and the square of the Reynolds
number determine which form of convection dominates. If       G r  /  R  e  2
&#x226B; 1     {\displaystyle {\rm {Gr/Re^{2}\gg 1}}}  [{\displaystyle {\rm
{Gr/Re^{2}\gg 1}}}], forced convection may be neglected, whereas if       G r
/  R  e  2   &#x226A; 1     {\displaystyle {\rm {Gr/Re^{2}\ll 1}}}  [
{\displaystyle {\rm {Gr/Re^{2}\ll 1}}}], natural convection may be neglected.
If the ratio, known as the Richardson_number, is approximately one, then both
forced and natural convection need to be taken into account.
