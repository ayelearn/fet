****** Protein efficiency ratio ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Protein efficiency ratio (PER) is based on the weight gain of a test subject
divided by its intake of a particular food protein during the test period.
From 1919 until very recently[when?], the PER had been a widely used method for
evaluating the quality of protein in food.
The food industry in Canada currently uses the PER as the standard for
evaluating the protein quality of foods.[1] The official method for determining
the protein efficiency ratio is from Health Canada's Health Protection Branch
Method FO-1, October 15, 1981.[2]
The U.S. Food_and_Drug_Administration now uses the Protein_Digestibility
Corrected_Amino_Acid_Score (PDCAAS) as the basis for the percent of the U.S.
recommended_daily_allowance (USRDA) for protein shown on food labels. However,
the PER is still used in certain FDA regulations. The US FDA official methods
to calculate the PER are as stated in the Official Methods of Analysis of AOAC
International, 16th ed. (1995) Section 45.3.05, AOAC Official Method 982.30
Protein Efficiency Ratio Calculation Method; and Official Methods of Analysis
of AOAC International, 18th ed. (2005).[3]
