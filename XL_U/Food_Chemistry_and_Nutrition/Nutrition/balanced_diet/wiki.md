Leafy_green, cruciferous, and other raw vegetables may contribute to a healthy
diet
A healthy diet is a diet that helps to maintain or improve overall health. A
healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients,
micronutrients, and adequate calories.[1][2]
For people who are healthy, a healthy diet is not complicated and contains
mostly fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes little to no
processed_food and sweetened_beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can
be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-
animal source of vitamin_B12 is needed for those following a vegan_diet.[3]
Various nutrition_guides are published by medical and governmental institutions
to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition
facts_labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose
between foods based on the components relevant to health.[4]
A healthy lifestyle includes getting exercise every day along with eating a
healthy diet. A healthy lifestyle may lower disease risks, such as obesity,
heart_disease, type_2_diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and cancer.
[1][5]
There are specialized healthy diets, called medical_nutrition_therapy, for
people with various diseases or conditions. There are also prescientific ideas
about such specialized diets, as in dietary_therapy_in_traditional_Chinese
medicine.

***** Recommendations[edit] *****
**** World Health Organization[edit] ****
The World_Health_Organization (WHO) makes the following five recommendations
with respect to both populations and individuals:[6]
   1. Maintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories
      that your body is using.
   2. Limit intake of fats. Not more than 30% of the total calories should come
      from fats. Prefer unsaturated_fats to saturated_fats. Avoid trans_fats.
   3. Eat at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day (potatoes, sweet
      potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots do not count). A healthy diet
      also contains legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), whole_grains and nuts.
   4. Limit the intake of simple sugars to less than 10% of calorie (below 5%
      of calories or 25 grams may be even better).[7]
   5. Limit salt / sodium from all sources and ensure that salt_is_iodized.
      Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular
      disease.[8]
The WHO has stated that insufficient vegetables and fruit is the cause of 2.8%
of deaths worldwide.[8]
Other WHO recommendations include:
    * ensuring that the foods chosen have sufficient vitamins and certain
      minerals;
    * avoiding directly poisonous (e.g. heavy metals) and carcinogenic (e.g.
      benzene) substances;
    * avoiding foods contaminated by human pathogens (e.g. E._coli, tapeworm
      eggs);
    * and replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated_fats in the diet, which
      can reduce the risk of coronary_artery_disease and diabetes.[8]
**** United States Department of Agriculture[edit] ****
Main article: History_of_USDA_nutrition_guides
Main article: MyPlate
The Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans by the United_States_Department_of
Agriculture (USDA) recommends three healthy patterns of diet, summarized in the
table below, for a 2000 kcal diet.[9]
It emphasizes both health and environmental sustainability and a flexible
approach. The committee that drafted it wrote: "The major findings regarding
sustainable diets were that a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as
vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in
calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with
less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet. This pattern of eating
can be achieved through a variety of dietary patterns, including the âHealthy
U.S.-style Patternâ, the âHealthy Vegetarian Pattern" and the "Healthy
Mediterranean-style Pattern".[10] Food group amounts are per day, unless noted
per week.

**** American Heart Association / World Cancer Research Fund / American
Institute for Cancer Research[edit] ****
The American_Heart_Association, World_Cancer_Research_Fund, and American
Institute_for_Cancer_Research recommend a diet that consists mostly of
unprocessed plant foods, with emphasis on a wide range of whole grains,
legumes, and non-starchy vegetables and fruits. This healthy diet includes a
wide range of non-starchy vegetables and fruits which provide different colors
including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. The recommendations
note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and
cruciferous_vegetables like cauliflower, provide some protection against
cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against
weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary
drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including âfast foodsâ and red meat,
and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity. Overall,
researchers and medical policy conclude that this healthy diet can reduce the
risk of chronic disease and cancer.[11][12]
It is recommended that children consume less than 25 grams of added sugar (100
calories) per day.[13] Other recommendations include no extra sugars in those
under 2 years old and less than one soft drink per week.[13] As of 2017,
decreasing total fat is no longer recommended, but instead, the recommendation
to lower risk of cardiovascular_disease is to increase consumption of
monounsaturated_fats and polyunsaturated_fats, while decreasing consumption of
saturated_fats.[14]
**** Harvard School of Public Health[edit] ****
Further information: Healthy_eating_pyramid
The Nutrition Source of Harvard_School_of_Public_Health makes the following 10
recommendations for a healthy diet:[15]
    * Choose good carbohydrates: whole grains (the less processed the better),
      vegetables, fruits and beans. Avoid white bread, white rice, and the like
      as well as pastries, sugared sodas, and other highly processed food.[16]
    * Pay attention to the protein package: good choices include fish, poultry,
      nuts, and beans. Try to avoid red meat.[17]
    * Choose foods containing healthy fats. Plant oils, nuts, and fish are the
      best choices. Limit consumption of saturated fats, and avoid foods with
      trans fat.[15]
    * Choose a fiber-filled diet which includes whole grains, vegetables, and
      fruits.[18]
    * Eat more vegetables and fruitsâthe more colorful and varied, the
      better.[15]
    * Include adequate amounts of calcium in the diet; however, milk is not the
      best or only source. Good sources of calcium are collards, bok choy,
      fortified soy milk, baked beans, and supplements containing calcium and
      vitamin D.[19]
    * Prefer water over other beverages. Avoid sugary drinks, and limit intake
      of juices and milk. Coffee, tea, artificially-sweetened drinks, 100-
      percent fruit juices, low-fat milk and alcohol can fit into a healthy
      diet but are best consumed in moderation. Sports drinks are recommended
      only for people who exercise more than an hour at a stretch to replace
      substances lost in sweat.[20]
    * Limit salt intake. Choose more fresh foods, instead of processed ones.
      [15]
    * Drink alcohol in moderation. Doing so has health benefits, but is not
      recommended for everyone.[15]
    * Consider intake of daily multivitamin and extra vitamin_D, as these have
      potential health benefits.[15]
Other than nutrition, the guide recommends frequent physical_exercise and
maintaining a healthy body_weight.[15]
**** Others[edit] ****
David_L._Katz, who reviewed the most prevalent popular diets in 2014, noted:
     The weight of evidence strongly supports a theme of healthful eating
     while allowing for variations on that theme. A diet of minimally
     processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively
     associated with health promotion and disease prevention and is
     consistent with the salient components of seemingly distinct dietary
     approaches. Efforts to improve public health through diet are
     forestalled not for want of knowledge about the optimal feeding of
     Homo sapiens but for distractions associated with exaggerated claims,
     and our failure to convert what we reliably know into what we
     routinely do. Knowledge in this case is not, as of yet, power; would
     that it were so.[21]
Marion_Nestle expresses the mainstream view among scientists who study
nutrition:[22]:10
     The basic principles of good diets are so simple that I can summarize
     them in just ten words: eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits and
     vegetables. For additional clarification, a five-word modifier helps:
     go easy on junk_foods. Follow these precepts and you will go a long
     way toward preventing the major diseases of our overfed
     societyâcoronary heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes, stroke,
     osteoporosis, and a host of others.... These precepts constitute the
     bottom line of what seem to be the far more complicated dietary
     recommendations of many health organizations and national and
     international governmentsâthe forty-one âkey recommendationsâ
     of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines, for example. ... Although you may
     feel as though advice about nutrition is constantly changing, the
     basic ideas behind my four precepts have not changed in half a
     century. And they leave plenty of room for enjoying the pleasures of
     food.[23]:22
***** For specific conditions[edit] *****
In addition to dietary recommendations for the general population, there are
many specific diets that have primarily been developed to promote better health
in specific population groups, such as people with high_blood_pressure (such as
low_sodium_diets or the more specific DASH_diet), or people who are overweight
or obese (weight_control_diets). However, some of them may have more or less
evidence for beneficial effects in normal people as well.
**** Hypertension[edit] ****
A low sodium diet is beneficial for people with high blood pressure. The
Cochrane_review published in 2008 concluded that a long term (more than 4
weeks) low sodium diet usefully lowers blood pressure, both in people with
hypertension (high blood pressure) and in those with normal blood pressure.[24]
The DASH_diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a diet promoted by
the National_Heart,_Lung,_and_Blood_Institute (part of the NIH, a United States
government organization) to control hypertension. A major feature of the plan
is limiting intake of sodium,[25] and the diet also generally encourages the
consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables while
lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also "rich in
potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein".
The Mediterranean_diet, which includes limiting consumption of red meat and
using olive oil in cooking, has also been shown to improve cardiovascular
outcomes.[26]
**** Obesity[edit] ****
Further information: Dieting
Most people who are overweight or obese can use dieting in combination with
physical_exercise to lose weight.
Diets to promote weight_loss are divided into four categories: low-fat, low-
carbohydrate, low-calorie, and very_low_calorie.[27] A meta-analysis of six
randomized controlled trials found no difference between the main diet types
(low calorie, low carbohydrate, and low fat), with a 2â4 kilogram weight loss
in all studies.[27] After two years, all of the diets in the studies that
reduced calories resulted in equal weight loss regardless of whether changes in
fat or carbohydrate consumption were emphasized.[28]
**** Gluten-related disorders[edit] ****
Further information: Gluten-free_diet
Gluten, a mixture of proteins found in wheat and related grains including
barley, rye, oat, and all their species and hybrids (such as spelt, kamut, and
triticale),[29] causes health_problems for those with gluten-related_disorders,
including celiac_disease, non-celiac_gluten_sensitivity, gluten_ataxia,
dermatitis_herpetiformis, and wheat_allergy.[30] In these people, the gluten-
free diet is the only available treatment.[31][32][33]
***** Reduced disease risk[edit] *****
Further information: Diet_and_cancer
There may be a relationship between lifestyle including food consumption and
lowering the risk of cancer and other chronic_diseases. A diet high in fruit
and vegetables appears to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and
death, but not cancer.[34]
Eating a healthy diet and getting_enough_exercise can maintain body weight
within the normal range and prevent obesity in most people, and thus prevent
the chronic_diseases and poor outcomes associated with obesity.[35]
***** Unhealthy diets[edit] *****
The Western_pattern_diet which is typically eaten by Americans and increasingly
adopted by people in the developing world as they leave poverty is unhealthy:
it is "rich in red meat, dairy products, processed and artificially sweetened
foods, and salt, with minimal intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, and
whole grains."[36]
An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases
including: high_blood_pressure, high_cholesterol, diabetes, abnormal blood
lipids, overweight/obesity, cardiovascular_diseases, and cancer.[37]
The WHO estimates that 2.7 million deaths each year are attributable to a diet
low in fruit and vegetables.[37] Globally such diets are estimated to cause
about 19% of gastrointestinal_cancer, 31% of ischaemic_heart_disease, and 11%
of strokes,[5] thus making it one of the leading preventable_causes_of_death
worldwide.[38]
**** Popular diets[edit] ****
Some publicised diets, often referred to as fad_diets, make promises of weight
loss or other health advantages such as longer life without backing by solid
science; many fad diets are based on highly restrictive or unusual food
choices.[23]:296[39] Celebrity endorsements (including celebrity doctors) are
frequently associated with such diets, and the individuals who develop and
promote these programs often profit handsomely.[22]:11â12[40]
***** Public health[edit] *****
Consumers are generally aware of the elements of a healthy diet, but find
nutrition labels and diet advice in popular media confusing.[41]
Fears of high cholesterol were frequently voiced up until the mid-1990s.
However, more recent research has shown that the distinction between high- and
low-density lipoprotein ('good' and 'bad' cholesterol, respectively) must be
addressed when speaking of the potential ill effects of cholesterol. Different
types of dietary fat have different effects on blood levels of cholesterol. For
example, polyunsaturated fats tend to decrease both types of cholesterol;
monounsaturated fats tend to lower LDL and raise HDL; saturated fats tend to
either raise HDL, or raise both HDL and LDL;[42][43] and trans fat tend to
raise LDL and lower HDL.
Dietary cholesterol is only found in animal products such as meat, eggs, and
dairy. The effect of dietary cholesterol on blood cholesterol levels is
controversial. Some studies have found a link between cholesterol consumption
and serum cholesterol levels.[44] Other studies have not found a link between
eating cholesterol and blood levels of cholesterol.[45]
Vending_machines in particular have come under fire as being avenues of entry
into schools for junk_food promoters. However, there is little in the way of
regulation and it is difficult for most people to properly analyze the real
merits of a company referring to itself as "healthy." Recently, the Committee
of_Advertising_Practice in the United Kingdom launched a proposal to limit
media advertising for food and soft drink products high in fat, salt or sugar.
[46] The British_Heart_Foundation released its own government-funded
advertisements, labeled "Food4Thought", which were targeted at children and
adults to discourage unhealthy habits of consuming junk_food.[47]
From a psychological and cultural perspective, a healthier diet may be
difficult to achieve for people with poor eating habits.[48] This may be due to
tastes acquired in childhood and preferences for sugary, salty and/or fatty
foods.[49] In the UK, the chief medical officer of the government recommended
in December 2018 that sugar and salt be taxed to discourage consumption.[50]
***** Other animals[edit] *****
Animals that are kept by humans also benefit from a healthy diet, but the
requirements of such diets may be very different from the ideal human diet.[51]

      Similar proteins to the gliadin found in wheat exist as secalin in rye,
      hordein in barley, and avenins in oats and are collectively referred to
      as âgluten.â Derivatives of these grains such as triticale and malt
      and other ancient wheat varieties such as spelt and kamut also contain
      gluten. The gluten found in all of these grains has been identified as
      the component capable of triggering the immune-mediated disorder, coeliac
      disease.

      recently proposed approach to NCGS diagnosis is an objective improvement
      of gastrointestinal symptoms and extra-intestinal manifestations assessed
      through a rating scale before and after GFD. Although a standardized
      symptom rating scale is not yet applied worldwide, a recent study
      indicated that a decrease of the global symptom score higher than 50%
      after GFD can be regarded as confirmatory of NCGS (Table 1) [53]. (â¦)
      After the confirmation of NCGS diagnosis, according to the previously
      mentioned work-up, patients are advized to start with a GFD [49].
