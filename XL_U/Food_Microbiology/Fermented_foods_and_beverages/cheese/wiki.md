Cheese is a dairy_product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of
flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It
comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats,
or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the
enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into
final form.[1] Some cheeses have molds on the rind, the outer layer, or
throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.
Over a thousand types_of_cheese from various countries are produced. Their
styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the
animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the
bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood_smoke may
be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as
Red_Leicester, is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to
some cheeses, such as black_pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries.
For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon
juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn
milk_sugars into lactic_acid, then the addition of rennet completes the
curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by
fermentation of the fungus Mucor_miehei, but others have been extracted from
various species of the Cynara thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region
may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.
Cheese is valued for its portability, long life, and high content of fat,
protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf
life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of
cheese.[2] Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, last longer than soft cheeses, such
as Brie or goat's milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses,
especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are
favorable. Vacuum_packaging of block-shaped cheeses and gas-flushing of plastic
bags with mixtures of carbon_dioxide and nitrogen are used for storage and mass
distribution of cheeses in the 21st_century.[2]
A specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a cheesemonger. Becoming an
expert in this field requires some formal education and years of tasting and
hands-on experience, much like becoming an expert in wine or cuisine. The
cheesemonger is responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory: selecting
the cheese menu, purchasing, receiving, storage, and ripening.[3]

***** Etymology *****
Various hard cheeses
The word cheese comes from Latin caseus,[4] from which the modern word casein
is also derived. The earliest source is from the proto-Indo-European root
*kwat-, which means "to ferment, become sour". The word cheese comes from chese
(in Middle_English) and cÄ«ese or cÄse (in Old_English). Similar words are
shared by other West_Germanic_languagesâWest_Frisian tsiis, Dutch kaas,
German KÃ¤se, Old_High_German chÄsiâall from the reconstructed West-Germanic
form *kÄsÄ«, which in turn is an early borrowing from Latin.
The Online_Etymological_Dictionary states that "cheese" comes from "Old English
cyse (West Saxon), cese (Anglian)...from West Germanic *kasjus (source also of
Old Saxon kasi, Old High German chasi, German KÃ¤se, Middle Dutch case, Dutch
kaas), from Latin caseus [for] "cheese" (source of Italian cacio, Spanish
queso, Irish caise, Welsh caws)."[5] The Online Etymological Dictionary states
that the word is of "unknown origin; perhaps from a PIE root *kwat- "to
ferment, become sour" (source also of Prakrit chasi "buttermilk;" Old Church
Slavonic kvasu "leaven; fermented drink," kyselu "sour," -kyseti "to turn
sour;" Czech kysati "to turn sour, rot;" Sanskrit kvathati "boils, seethes;"
Gothic hwaÃ¾jan "foam"). Also compare fromage. Old Norse ostr, Danish ost,
Swedish ost are related to Latin ius "broth, sauce, juice.'"[5]
When the Romans began to make hard cheeses for their legionaries' supplies, a
new word started to be used: formaticum, from caseus formatus, or "molded
cheese" (as in "formed", not "moldy"). It is from this word that the French
fromage, standard Italian formaggio, Catalan formatge, Breton fourmaj, and
Occitan fromatge (or formatge) are derived. Of the Romance languages, Spanish,
Portuguese, Romanian, Tuscan and Southern Italian dialects use words derived
from caseus (queso, queijo, caÈ and caso for example). The word cheese itself
is occasionally employed in a sense that means "molded" or "formed". Head
cheese uses the word in this sense. The term "cheese" is also used as a noun,
verb and adjective in a number_of_figurative_expressions (e.g., "the big
cheese", "to be cheesed off" and "cheesy lyrics").[citation_needed]
***** History *****
Main article: History_of_cheese
**** Origins ****
A piece of soft curd cheese, oven-baked to increase longevity
Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded_history. There is no
conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, whether in
Europe, Central_Asia or the Middle_East, but the practice had spread within
Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny_the_Elder, had become a
sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman_Empire came into being.[6]
Earliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000
BCE, when sheep were first domesticated. Since animal skins and inflated
internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range
of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered
accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal,
resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the
stomach.[citation_needed] There is a legendâwith variationsâabout the
discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk.[7]
The earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back
to 5500 BCE and is found in what is now Kujawy, Poland, where strainers coated
with milk-fat molecules have been found.[8]
Cheesemaking may have begun independently of this by the pressing and salting
of curdled milk to preserve it. Observation that the effect of making cheese in
an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may have led to the
deliberate addition of rennet. Early archeological evidence of Egyptian_cheese
has been found in Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE.[9]
The earliest cheeses were likely quite sour and salty, similar in texture to
rustic cottage_cheese or feta, a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese. Cheese
produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East, required
less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a
suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their
respective flavors. The earliest ever discovered preserved cheese was found in
the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China, and it dates back as early as 1615
BCE.[10]
A 2018 paper published in Analytical_Chemistry stated that the world's oldest
cheese, dating to approximately 3200 years before present, was found in ancient
Egyptian tombs.[11][12]
**** Ancient Greece and Rome ****
Cheese in a market in Italy
Ancient Greek_mythology credited Aristaeus with the discovery of cheese.
Homer's Odyssey (8th century BCE) describes the Cyclops making and storing
sheep's and goats' milk cheese (translation by Samuel_Butler):
     We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went
     inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were
     loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens
     could hold...
     When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in
     due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled
     half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers.[13]
By Roman times, cheese was an everyday food and cheesemaking a mature art.
Columella's De Re Rustica (c. 65 CE) details a cheesemaking process involving
rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. Pliny's Natural
History (77 CE) devotes a chapter (XI, 97) to describing the diversity of
cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early Empire. He stated that the best cheeses
came from the villages near NÃ®mes, but did not keep long and had to be eaten
fresh. Cheeses of the Alps and Apennines were as remarkable for their variety
then as now. A Ligurian cheese was noted for being made mostly from sheep's
milk, and some cheeses produced nearby were stated to weigh as much as a
thousand pounds each. Goats' milk cheese was a recent taste in Rome, improved
over the "medicinal taste" of Gaul's similar cheeses by smoking. Of cheeses
from overseas, Pliny preferred those of Bithynia in Asia Minor.

**** Post-Roman Europe ****
As Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar newly settled neighbors,
bringing their own cheese-making traditions, their own flocks and their own
unrelated words for cheese, cheeses in Europe diversified further, with various
locales developing their own distinctive traditions and products. As long-
distance trade collapsed, only travelers would encounter unfamiliar cheeses:
Charlemagne's first encounter with a white cheese that had an edible rind forms
one of the constructed anecdotes of Notker's Life of the Emperor.
The British_Cheese_Board claims that Britain has approximately 700 distinct
local cheeses;[14] France and Italy have perhaps 400 each. (A French proverb
holds there is a different French cheese for every day of the year, and Charles
de_Gaulle once asked "how can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds
of cheese?")[15] Still, the advancement of the cheese art in Europe was slow
during the centuries after Rome's fall. Many cheeses today were first recorded
in the late Middle_Ages or afterâcheeses like Cheddar around 1500, Parmesan
in 1597, Gouda in 1697, and Camembert in 1791.[16]
In 1546 The_Proverbs_of_John_Heywood claimed "the_moon_is_made_of_a_greene
cheese." (Greene may refer here not to the color, as many now think, but to
being new or unaged.)[17] Variations on this sentiment were long repeated and
NASA exploited this myth for an April_Fools'_Day spoof announcement in 2006.
[18]
**** Modern era ****
Cheese display in grocery store, Cambridge,_Massachusetts in United States.
Until its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard
of in east Asian cultures, in the pre-Columbian Americas, and only had limited
use in sub-Mediterranean Africa, mainly being widespread and popular only in
Europe, the Middle East, the Indian_subcontinent, and areas influenced by those
cultures. But with the spread, first of European imperialism, and later of
Euro-American culture and food, cheese has gradually become known and
increasingly popular worldwide.
The first factory for the industrial production of cheese opened in Switzerland
in 1815, but large-scale production first found real success in the United
States. Credit usually goes to Jesse Williams, a dairy farmer from Rome, New
York, who in 1851 started making cheese in an assembly-line fashion using the
milk from neighboring farms. Within decades, hundreds of such dairy
associations existed.[19]
The 1860s saw the beginnings of mass-produced rennet, and by the turn of the
century scientists were producing pure microbial cultures. Before then,
bacteria in cheesemaking had come from the environment or from recycling an
earlier batch's whey; the pure cultures meant a more standardized cheese could
be produced.[20]
Factory-made cheese overtook traditional cheesemaking in the World_War_II era,
and factories have been the source of most cheese in America and Europe ever
since.

***** Production *****
French Cheeses
In 2014, world production of cheese from whole cow milk was 18.7 million
tonnes, with the United States accounting for 29% (5.4 million tonnes) of the
world total followed by Germany, France and Italy as major producers (table).
[21]
Other 2014 world totals for processed cheese include:[21]
    * from skimmed cow milk, 2.4 million tonnes (leading country, Germany,
      845,500 tonnes)
    * from goat milk, 523,040 tonnes (leading country, South_Sudan, 110,750
      tonnes)
    * from sheep milk, 680,302 tonnes (leading country, Greece, 125,000 tonnes)
    * from buffalo milk, 282,127 tonnes (leading country, Egypt, 254,000
      tonnes)
During 2015, Germany, France, Netherlands and Italy exported 10-14% of their
produced cheese.[22] The United States was a marginal exporter (5.3% of total
cow milk production), as most of its output was for the domestic market.[22]
**** Consumption ****
France, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Germany were the highest consumers of
cheese in 2014, averaging 25 kg (55 lb) per person.[23]

**** Curdling ****
During industrial production of Emmental cheese, the as-yet-undrained curd is
broken by rotating mixers.
A required step in cheesemaking is separating the milk into solid curds and
liquid whey. Usually this is done by acidifying (souring) the milk and adding
rennet. The acidification can be accomplished directly by the addition of an
acid, such as vinegar, in a few cases (paneer, queso_fresco). More commonly
starter_bacteria are employed instead which convert milk_sugars into lactic
acid. The same bacteria (and the enzymes they produce) also play a large role
in the eventual flavor of aged cheeses. Most cheeses are made with starter
bacteria from the Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, or Streptococcus families. Swiss
starter cultures also include Propionibacter_shermani, which produces carbon
dioxide gas bubbles during aging, giving Swiss_cheese or Emmental its holes
(called "eyes").
Some fresh cheeses are curdled only by acidity, but most cheeses also use
rennet. Rennet sets the cheese into a strong and rubbery gel compared to the
fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation alone. It also allows curdling at
a lower acidityâimportant because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited in
high-acidity environments. In general, softer, smaller, fresher cheeses are
curdled with a greater proportion of acid to rennet than harder, larger,
longer-aged varieties.
While rennet was traditionally produced via extraction from the inner mucosa of
the fourth stomach chamber of slaughtered young, unweaned calves, most rennet
used today in cheesemaking is produced recombinantly.[24] The majority of the
applied chymosin is retained in the whey and, at most, may be present in cheese
in trace quantities. In ripe cheese, the type and provenance of chymosin used
in production cannot be determined.[24]
**** Curd processing ****
At this point, the cheese has set into a very moist gel. Some soft cheeses are
now essentially complete: they are drained, salted, and packaged. For most of
the rest, the curd is cut into small cubes. This allows water to drain from the
individual pieces of curd.
Some hard cheeses are then heated to temperatures in the range of 35â55 Â°C
(95â131 Â°F). This forces more whey from the cut curd. It also changes the
taste of the finished cheese, affecting both the bacterial culture and the milk
chemistry. Cheeses that are heated to the higher temperatures are usually made
with thermophilic starter bacteria that survive this stepâeither Lactobacilli
or Streptococci.
Salt has roles in cheese besides adding a salty flavor. It preserves cheese
from spoiling, draws moisture from the curd, and firms cheese's texture in an
interaction with its proteins. Some cheeses are salted from the outside with
dry salt or brine washes. Most cheeses have the salt mixed directly into the
curds.

Other techniques influence a cheese's texture and flavor. Some examples are :
    * Stretching: (Mozzarella, Provolone) The curd is stretched and kneaded in
      hot water, developing a stringy, fibrous body.
    * Cheddaring: (Cheddar, other English cheeses) The cut curd is repeatedly
      piled up, pushing more moisture away. The curd is also mixed (or milled)
      for a long time, taking the sharp edges off the cut curd pieces and
      influencing the final product's texture.
    * Washing: (Edam, Gouda, Colby) The curd is washed in warm water, lowering
      its acidity and making for a milder-tasting cheese.
Most cheeses achieve their final shape when the curds are pressed into a mold
or form. The harder the cheese, the more pressure is applied. The pressure
drives out moistureâthe molds are designed to allow water to escapeâand
unifies the curds into a single solid body.

**** Ripening ****
Main article: Cheese_ripening
A newborn cheese is usually salty yet bland in flavor and, for harder
varieties, rubbery in texture. These qualities are sometimes enjoyedâcheese
curds are eaten on their ownâbut normally cheeses are left to rest under
controlled conditions. This aging period (also called ripening, or, from the
French, affinage) lasts from a few days to several years. As a cheese ages,
microbes and enzymes transform texture and intensify flavor. This
transformation is largely a result of the breakdown of casein proteins and
milkfat into a complex mix of amino_acids, amines, and fatty_acids.
Some cheeses have additional bacteria or molds intentionally introduced before
or during aging. In traditional cheesemaking, these microbes might be already
present in the aging room; they are simply allowed to settle and grow on the
stored cheeses. More often today, prepared cultures are used, giving more
consistent results and putting fewer constraints on the environment where the
cheese ages. These cheeses include soft ripened cheeses such as Brie and
Camembert, blue cheeses such as Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and rind-washed
cheeses such as Limburger.
***** Types *****
Main article: Types_of_cheese
There are many types of cheese, with around 500 different varieties recognized
by the International Dairy Federation,[25] more than 400 identified by Walter
and Hargrove, more than 500 by Burkhalter, and more than 1,000 by Sandine and
Elliker.[26] The varieties may be grouped or classified into types according to
criteria such as length of ageing, texture, methods of making, fat content,
animal milk, country or region of origin, etc.âwith these criteria either
being used singly or in combination,[27] but with no single method being
universally used.[28] The method most commonly and traditionally used is based
on moisture content, which is then further discriminated by fat content and
curing or ripening methods.[25][29] Some attempts have been made to rationalise
the classification of cheeseâa scheme was proposed by Pieter Walstra which
uses the primary and secondary starter combined with moisture content, and
Walter and Hargrove suggested classifying by production methods which produces
18 types, which are then further grouped by moisture content.[25]
Moisture content (soft to hard) Categorizing cheeses by firmness is a common
but inexact practice. The lines between "soft", "semi-soft", "semi-hard", and
"hard" are arbitrary, and many types of cheese are made in softer or firmer
variations.[citation_needed] The main factor that controls cheese hardness is
moisture content, which depends largely on the pressure with which it is packed
into molds and aging time.[citation_needed]
Fresh, whey and stretched curd cheeses The main factor in the categorization of
these cheeses is their age.[citation_needed] Fresh cheeses without additional
preservatives can spoil in a matter of days.[citation_needed]
Content (double cream, goat, ewe and water buffalo) Some cheeses are
categorized by the source of the milk used to produce them or by the added fat
content of the milk from which they are produced. While most of the world's
commercially available cheese is made from cows' milk, many parts of the world
also produce cheese from goats and sheep.
Some cheeses are described by their fat content. Double cream cheeses are soft
cheeses of cows' milk enriched with cream so that their fat_in_dry_matter (FDM
or FiDM) is 60â75%; triple cream cheeses are enriched to at least 75%.
[citation_needed]
Soft-ripened and blue-vein There are at least three main categories of cheese
in which the presence of mold is a significant feature: soft ripened cheese,
washed-rind_cheese, and blue cheese.[citation_needed]
Processed cheeses Processed_cheese is made from traditional cheese and
emulsifying salts, often with the addition of milk, more salt, preservatives,
and food_coloring.[citation_needed] It is inexpensive, consistent, and melts
smoothly.[citation_needed] It is sold packaged and either pre-sliced or
unsliced, in a number of varieties.[citation_needed] It is also available in
aerosol cans in some countries.[citation_needed]

***** Cooking and eating *****

At refrigerator temperatures, the fat in a piece of cheese is as hard as
unsoftened butter, and its protein structure is stiff as well. Flavor and odor
compounds are less easily liberated when cold. For improvements in flavor and
texture, it is widely advised that cheeses be allowed to warm up to room
temperature before eating. If the cheese is further warmed, to 26â32 Â°C
(79â90 Â°F), the fats will begin to "sweat out" as they go beyond soft to
fully liquid.[30]
Above room temperatures, most hard cheeses melt. Rennet-curdled cheeses have a
gel-like protein matrix that is broken down by heat. When enough protein bonds
are broken, the cheese itself turns from a solid to a viscous liquid. Soft,
high-moisture cheeses will melt at around 55 Â°C (131 Â°F), while hard, low-
moisture cheeses such as Parmesan remain solid until they reach about 82 Â°C
(180 Â°F).[30] Acid-set cheeses, including halloumi, paneer, some whey cheeses
and many varieties of fresh goat_cheese, have a protein structure that remains
intact at high temperatures. When cooked, these cheeses just get firmer as
water evaporates.
Some cheeses, like raclette, melt smoothly; many tend to become stringy or
suffer from a separation of their fats. Many of these can be coaxed into
melting smoothly in the presence of acids or starch. Fondue, with wine
providing the acidity, is a good example of a smoothly melted cheese dish.[30]
Elastic stringiness is a quality that is sometimes enjoyed, in dishes including
pizza and Welsh_rarebit. Even a melted cheese eventually turns solid again,
after enough moisture is cooked off. The saying "you can't melt cheese twice"
(meaning "some things can only be done once") refers to the fact that oils
leach out during the first melting and are gone, leaving the non-meltable
solids behind.
As its temperature continues to rise, cheese will brown and eventually burn.
Browned, partially burned cheese has a particular distinct flavor of its own
and is frequently used in cooking (e.g., sprinkling atop items before baking
them).
**** Cheeseboard ****
Various cheeses on a cheeseboard served with wine for lunch
A cheeseboard (or cheese course) may be served at the end of a meal, either
replacing, before or following dessert. The British tradition is to have cheese
after dessert, accompanied by sweet wines like Port. In France, cheese is
consumed before dessert, with robust red wine.[31][32] A cheeseboard typically
has contrasting cheeses with accompaniments, such as crackers, biscuits,
grapes, nuts, celery or chutney.[32] A cheeseboard 70 feet (21 m) long was used
to feature the variety of cheeses manufactured in Wisconsin,[33] where the
state_legislature recognizes a "cheesehead" hat as a state symbol.[34]
***** Nutrition and health *****
The nutritional value of cheese varies widely. Cottage cheese may consist of 4%
fat and 11% protein while some whey cheeses are 15% fat and 11% protein, and
triple-crÃ¨me cheeses are 36% fat and 7% protein.[35] In general, cheese is a
rich source (20% or more of the Daily_Value, DV) of calcium, protein,
phosphorus, sodium and saturated_fat. A 28-gram (one ounce) serving of cheddar
cheese contains about 7 grams (0.25 oz) of protein and 202 milligrams of
calcium.[35] Nutritionally, cheese is essentially concentrated milk, but
altered by the culturing and aging processes: it takes about 200 grams (7.1 oz)
of milk to provide that much protein, and 150 grams (5.3 oz) to equal the
calcium.[35]

**** Cardiovascular disease ****
National health organizations, such as the American_Heart_Association,
Association_of_UK_Dietitians, British National_Health_Service, and Mayo_Clinic,
among others, recommend that cheese consumption be minimized, replaced in
snacks and meals by plant_foods, or restricted to low-fat cheeses to reduce
caloric intake and blood levels of HDL_fat, which is a risk_factor for
cardiovascular_diseases.[37][38][39][40] There is no high-quality_clinical
evidence that cheese consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
[37]
**** Pasteurization ****
A number of food safety agencies around the world have warned of the risks of
raw-milk cheeses. The U.S. Food_and_Drug_Administration states that soft raw-
milk cheeses can cause "serious infectious diseases including listeriosis,
brucellosis, salmonellosis and tuberculosis".[41] It is U.S. law since 1944
that all raw-milk cheeses (including imports since 1951) must be aged at least
60 days. Australia has a wide ban on raw-milk cheeses as well, though in recent
years exceptions have been made for Swiss GruyÃ¨re, Emmental and Sbrinz, and
for French Roquefort.[42] There is a trend for cheeses to be pasteurized even
when not required by law.
Pregnant women may face an additional risk from cheese; the U.S. Centers_for
Disease_Control has warned pregnant women against eating soft-ripened cheeses
and blue-veined cheeses, due to the listeria risk, which can cause miscarriage
or harm the fetus.[43]
***** Cultural attitudes *****

Although cheese is a vital source of nutrition in many regions of the world and
is extensively consumed in others, its use is not universal.
Cheese is rarely found in Southeast and East_Asian_cuisines, presumably for
historical reasons as dairy farming has historically been rare in these
regions. However, Asian sentiment against cheese is not universal. In Nepal,
the Dairy Development Corporation commercially manufactures cheese made from
yak milk and a hard cheese made from either cow or yak milk known as chhurpi.
[44] The national dish of Bhutan, ema_datshi, is made from homemade yak or mare
milk cheese and hot peppers.[45] In Yunnan, China, several ethnic minority
groups produce Rushan and Rubing from cow's milk.[46] Cheese consumption may be
increasing in China, with annual sales doubling from 1996 to 2003 (to a still
small 30 million U.S._dollars a year).[47] Certain kinds of Chinese preserved
bean_curd are sometimes misleadingly referred to in English as "Chinese cheese"
because of their texture and strong flavor.
Strict followers of the dietary laws of Islam and Judaism must avoid cheeses
made with rennet from animals not slaughtered in a manner adhering to halal or
kosher laws.[48] Both faiths allow cheese made with vegetable-based rennet or
with rennet made from animals that were processed in a halal or kosher manner.
Many less orthodox Jews also believe that rennet undergoes enough processing to
change its nature entirely and do not consider it to ever violate kosher law.
(See Cheese_and_kashrut.) As cheese is a dairy food, under kosher rules it
cannot be eaten in the same_meal_with_any_meat.
Rennet derived from animal slaughter, and thus cheese made with animal-derived
rennet, is not vegetarian. Most widely available vegetarian cheeses are made
using rennet produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor_miehei.[49] Vegans
and other dairy-avoiding vegetarians do not eat conventional cheese, but some
vegetable-based cheese substitutes (soy or almond) are used as substitutes.[49]
Even in cultures with long cheese traditions, consumers may perceive some
cheeses that are especially pungent-smelling, or mold-bearing varieties such as
Limburger or Roquefort, as unpalatable. Such cheeses are an acquired taste
because they are processed using molds or microbiological_cultures,[50]
allowing odor and flavor molecules to resemble those in rotten foods. One
author stated: "An aversion to the odor of decay has the obvious biological
value of steering us away from possible food poisoning, so it is no wonder that
an animal food that gives off whiffs of shoes and soil and the stable takes
some getting used to."[30]
Collecting cheese labels is called "tyrosemiophilia".[51]
**** Figurative expressions ****
In the 19th century, "cheese" was used as a figurative way of saying "the
proper thing"; this usage comes "from Urdu chiz "a thing," from Persian chiz,
from Old Persian...ciÅ¡-ciy [which means] "something." The term "cheese" in
this sense was "[p]icked up by [colonial] British in India by 1818 and [was
also] used in the sense of "a big thing", for example in the expression "he's
the real chiz".[5] The expression "big cheese" was attested in use in 1914 to
mean an "important person"; this is likely "American English in origin". The
expression "to cut a big cheese" was used to mean "to look important"; this
figurative expression referred to the huge wheels of cheese displayed by cheese
retailers as a publicity stunt.[5] The phrase "cut the cheese" also became an
American slang term meaning to flatulate. The word "cheese" has also had the
meaning of "an ignorant, stupid person."[5]
Other figurative meanings involve the word "cheese" used as a verb. To "cheese"
is recorded as meaning to "stop (what one is doing), run off," in 1812 (this
was "thieves' slang").[5] To be "cheesed off" means to be annoyed.[5] The
expression "say cheese" in a photograph-taking context (when the photographer
wishes the people to smile for the photo), which means "to smile" dates from
1930 (the word was probably chosen because the "ee" encourages people to make a
smile).[5] The verb "cheese" was used as slang for "be quiet" in the early 19th
century in Britain.[5] The fictional "...notion that the moon is made of green
cheese as a type of a ridiculous assertion is from 1520s".[5] The figurative
expression "to make cheeses" is an 1830s phrase referring to schoolgirls who
amuse themselves by "...wheeling rapidly so one's petticoats blew out in a
circle then dropping down so they came to rest inflated and resembling a wheel
of cheese".[5] In video_game_slang "to cheese it" means to win a game by using
a strategy that requires minimal skill and knowledge or that exploits a glitch
or flaw in game design.[52]
The adjective "cheesy" has two meanings. The first is literal, and means
"cheese-like"; this definition is attested to from the late 14th century (e.g.,
"a cheesy substance oozed from the broken jar").[5] In the late 19th century,
medical writers used the term "cheesy" in a more literal sense, "to describe
morbid substances found in tumors, decaying flesh, etc."[5] The adjective also
has a figurative sense, meaning "cheap, inferior"; this use "... is attested
from 1896, perhaps originally U.S. student slang". In the late 19th century in
British slang, "cheesy" meant "fine, showy"; this use is attested to in the
1850s. In writing lyrics for pop_music, rock_music or musical_theatre, "cheesy"
is a pejorative term which means "blatantly artificial" (OED).
