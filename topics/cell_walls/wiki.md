A cell wall is a structural layer surrounding some types of cells, just outside
the cell_membrane. It can be tough, flexible, and sometimes rigid. It provides
the cell with both structural support and protection, and also acts as a
filtering mechanism.[1] Cell walls are present in most prokaryotes (except
mollicute bacteria), in algae, fungi and eukaryotes including plants but are
absent in animals. A major function is to act as pressure vessels, preventing
over-expansion of the cell when water enters.
The composition of cell walls varies between species and may depend on cell
type and developmental stage. The primary cell wall of land_plants is composed
of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin. Often, other
polymers such as lignin, suberin or cutin are anchored to or embedded in plant
cell walls. Algae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides
such as carrageenan and agar that are absent from land plants. In bacteria, the
cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan. The cell walls of archaea have various
compositions, and may be formed of glycoprotein S-layers, pseudopeptidoglycan,
or polysaccharides. Fungi possess cell walls made of the N-acetylglucosamine
polymer chitin. Unusually, diatoms have a cell wall composed of biogenic
silica.[2]

***** History *****
A plant cell wall was first observed and named (simply as a "wall") by Robert
Hooke in 1665.[3] However, "the dead excrusion product of the living
protoplast" was forgotten, for almost three centuries, being the subject of
scientific interest mainly as a resource for industrial processing or in
relation to animal or human health.[4]
In 1804, Karl_Rudolphi and J.H.F._Link proved that cells had independent cell
walls.[5][6] Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and that fluid
passed between them this way.
The mode of formation of the cell wall was controversial in the 19th century.
Hugo_von_Mohl (1853, 1858) advocated the idea that the cell wall grows by
apposition. Carl_NÃ¤geli (1858, 1862, 1863) believed that the growth of the
wall in thickness and in area was due to a process termed intussusception. Each
theory was improved in the following decades: the apposition (or lamination)
theory by Eduard_Strasburger (1882, 1889), and the intussusception theory by
Julius_Wiesner (1886).[7]
In 1930, Ernst_MÃ¼nch coined the term apoplast in order to separate the
"living" symplast from the "dead" plant region, the latter of which included
the cell wall.[8]
By the 1980s, some authors suggested replacing the term "cell wall",
particularly as it was used for plants, with the more precise term
"extracellular_matrix", as used for animal cells,[9][4]:168 but others
preferred the older term.[10]

Cell walls serve similar purposes in those organisms that possess them. They
may give cells rigidity and strength, offering protection against mechanical
stress. In multicellular organisms, they permit the organism to build and hold
a definite shape (morphogenesis). Cell walls also limit the entry of large
molecules that may be toxic to the cell. They further permit the creation of
stable osmotic environments by preventing osmotic_lysis and helping to retain
water. Their composition, properties, and form may change during the cell_cycle
and depend on growth conditions.
**** Rigidity of cell walls ****
In most cells, the cell wall is flexible, meaning that it will bend rather than
holding a fixed shape, but has considerable tensile_strength. The apparent
rigidity of primary plant tissues is enabled by cell walls, but is not due to
the walls' stiffness. Hydraulic turgor_pressure creates this rigidity, along
with the wall structure. The flexibility of the cell walls is seen when plants
wilt, so that the stems and leaves begin to droop, or in seaweeds that bend in
water_currents. As John Howland explains
     Think of the cell wall as a wicker basket in which a balloon has been
     inflated so that it exerts pressure from the inside. Such a basket is
     very rigid and resistant to mechanical damage. Thus does the
     prokaryote cell (and eukaryotic cell that possesses a cell wall) gain
     strength from a flexible plasma membrane pressing against a rigid
     cell wall.[11]
The apparent rigidity of the cell wall thus results from inflation of the cell
contained within. This inflation is a result of the passive_uptake_of_water.
In plants, a secondary cell wall is a thicker additional layer of cellulose
which increases wall rigidity. Additional layers may be formed by lignin in
xylem cell walls, or suberin in cork cell walls. These compounds are rigid and
waterproof, making the secondary wall stiff. Both wood and bark cells of trees
have secondary walls. Other parts of plants such as the leaf_stalk may acquire
similar reinforcement to resist the strain of physical forces.
**** Permeability ****
The primary cell wall of most plant_cells is freely permeable to small
molecules including small proteins, with size exclusion estimated to be 30-60
kDa.[12] The pH is an important factor governing the transport of molecules
through cell walls.[13]
***** Evolution *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (October
         2013)
Cell walls evolved independently in many groups, including within the
photosynthetic eukaryotes. In these lineages, the cell wall is closely related
to the evolution of multicellularity, terrestrialization and vascularization.
[14]
***** Plant cell walls *****
The walls of plant cells must have sufficient tensile strength to withstand
internal osmotic_pressures of several times atmospheric_pressure that result
from the difference in solute concentration between the cell interior and
external solutions.[1] Plant cell walls vary from 0.1 to several Âµm in
thickness.[15]
**** Layers ****
Cell wall in multicellular plants- its different layers and their placement
with respect to protoplasm (highly diagrammatic)
Molecular structure of the primary cell wall in plants.
Up to three strata or layers may be found in plant cell walls:[16]
    * The primary cell wall, generally a thin, flexible and extensible layer
      formed while the cell is growing.
    * The secondary_cell_wall, a thick layer formed inside the primary cell
      wall after the cell is fully grown. It is not found in all cell types.
      Some cells, such as the conducting cells in xylem, possess a secondary
      wall containing lignin, which strengthens and waterproofs the wall.
    * The middle_lamella, a layer rich in pectins. This outermost layer forms
      the interface between adjacent plant cells and glues them together.
**** Composition ****
In the primary (growing) plant cell wall, the major carbohydrates are
cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils are linked via
hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network, which is
embedded in the pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose in the primary
cell wall is xyloglucan.[17] In grass cell walls, xyloglucan and pectin are
reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronarabinoxylan, another
type of hemicellulose. Primary cell walls characteristically extend (grow) by a
mechanism called acid_growth, mediated by expansins, extracellular proteins
activated by acidic conditions that modify the hydrogen bonds between pectin
and cellulose.[18] This functions to increase cell wall extensibility. The
outer part of the primary cell wall of the plant epidermis is usually
impregnated with cutin and wax, forming a permeability barrier known as the
plant_cuticle.
Secondary cell walls contain a wide range of additional compounds that modify
their mechanical properties and permeability. The major polymers that make up
wood (largely secondary cell walls) include:
    * cellulose, 35-50%
    * xylan, 20-35%, a type of hemicellulose
    * lignin, 10-25%, a complex phenolic polymer that penetrates the spaces in
      the cell wall between cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components,
      driving out water and strengthening the wall.

cell walls (phragmoplast).
Additionally, structural proteins (1-5%) are found in most plant cell walls;
they are classified as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP),
arabinogalactan proteins (AGP), glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), and proline-rich
proteins (PRPs). Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic,
highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are glycosylated, contain
hydroxyproline (Hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall. These proteins
are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of
the epidermis may contain cutin. The Casparian_strip in the endodermis roots
and cork cells of plant bark contain suberin. Both cutin and suberin are
polyesters that function as permeability barriers to the movement of water.[19]
The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and proteins
varies between plants and between the cell type and age. Plant cells walls also
contain numerous enzymes, such as hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and
transglycosylases, that cut, trim and cross-link wall polymers.
Secondary walls - especially in grasses - may also contain microscopic silica
crystals, which may strengthen the wall and protect it from herbivores.
Cell walls in some plant tissues also function as storage deposits for
carbohydrates that can be broken down and resorbed to supply the metabolic and
growth needs of the plant. For example, endosperm cell walls in the seeds of
cereal grasses, nasturtium[20]:228 and other species, are rich in glucans and
other polysaccharides that are readily digested by enzymes during seed
germination to form simple sugars that nourish the growing embryo.
**** Formation ****
The middle lamella is laid down first, formed from the cell_plate during
cytokinesis, and the primary cell wall is then deposited inside the middle
lamella.[clarification_needed] The actual structure of the cell wall is not
clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model,
the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model.
However, the primary cell wall, can be defined as composed of cellulose
microfibrils aligned at all angles. Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the
plasma membrane by the cellulose_synthase_complex, which is proposed to be made
of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic
subunits for each of the six units.[21] Microfibrils are held together by
hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together
and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle lamella, which contains
magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic_acid). Cells interact though
plasmodesmata, which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to
the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.
In some plants and cell types, after a maximum size or point in development has
been reached, a secondary wall is constructed between the plasma membrane and
primary wall.[22] Unlike the primary wall, the cellulose microfibrils are
aligned parallel in layers, the orientation changing slightly with each
additional layer so that the structure becomes helicoidal.[23] Cells with
secondary cell walls can be rigid, as in the gritty sclereid cells in pear and
quince fruit. Cell to cell communication is possible through pits in the
secondary cell wall that allow plasmodesmata to connect cells through the
secondary cell walls.
***** Fungal cell walls *****
Chemical structure of a unit from a chitin polymer chain.
There are several groups of organisms that have been called "fungi". Some of
these groups (Oomycete and Myxogastria) have been transferred out of the
Kingdom Fungi, in part because of fundamental biochemical differences in the
composition of the cell wall. Most true fungi have a cell wall consisting
largely of chitin and other polysaccharides.[24] True fungi do not have
cellulose in their cell walls.[25]
**** True fungi ****
In fungi, the cell wall is the outer-most layer, external to the plasma
membrane. The fungal cell wall is a matrix of three main components:[25]
    * chitin: polymers consisting mainly of unbranched chains of Î²-(1,4)-
      linked-N-Acetylglucosamine in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, or poly-
      Î²-(1,4)-linked-N-Acetylglucosamine (chitosan) in the Zygomycota. Both
      chitin and chitosan are synthesized and extruded at the plasma_membrane.
      [25]
    * glucans: glucose polymers that function to cross-link chitin or chitosan
      polymers. Î²-glucans are glucose molecules linked via Î²-(1,3)- or Î²-
      (1,6)- bonds and provide rigidity to the cell wall while Î±-glucans are
      defined by Î±-(1,3)- and/or Î±-(1,4) bonds and function as part of the
      matrix.[25]
    * proteins: enzymes necessary for cell wall synthesis and lysis in addition
      to structural proteins are all present in the cell wall. Most of the
      structural proteins found in the cell wall are glycosylated and contain
      mannose, thus these proteins are called mannoproteins or mannans.[25]
***** Other eukaryotic cell walls *****
**** Algae ****
Scanning_electron micrographs of diatoms showing the external appearance of the
cell wall
Like plants, algae have cell walls.[26] Algal cell walls contain either
polysaccharides (such as cellulose (a glucan)) or a variety of glycoproteins
(Volvocales) or both. The inclusion of additional polysaccharides in algal
cells walls is used as a feature for algal taxonomy.
    * Mannans: They form microfibrils in the cell walls of a number of marine
      green_algae including those from the genera, Codium, Dasycladus, and
      Acetabularia as well as in the walls of some red_algae, like Porphyra and
      Bangia.
    * Xylans:
    * Alginic_acid: It is a common polysaccharide in the cell walls of brown
      algae.
    * Sulfonated polysaccharides: They occur in the cell walls of most algae;
      those common in red algae include agarose, carrageenan, porphyran,
      furcelleran and funoran.
Other compounds that may accumulate in algal cell walls include sporopollenin
and calcium_ions.
The group of algae known as the diatoms synthesize their cell walls (also known
as frustules or valves) from silicic_acid. Significantly, relative to the
organic cell walls produced by other groups, silica frustules require less
energy to synthesize (approximately 8%), potentially a major saving on the
overall cell energy budget[27] and possibly an explanation for higher growth
rates in diatoms.[28]
In brown_algae, phlorotannins may be a constituent of the cell walls.[29]
**** Water molds ****
The group Oomycetes, also known as water molds, are saprotrophic plant
pathogens like fungi. Until recently they were widely believed to be fungi, but
structural and molecular evidence[30] has led to their reclassification as
heterokonts, related to autotrophic brown_algae and diatoms. Unlike fungi,
oomycetes typically possess cell walls of cellulose and glucans rather than
chitin, although some genera (such as Achlya and Saprolegnia) do have chitin in
their walls.[31] The fraction of cellulose in the walls is no more than 4 to
20%, far less than the fraction of glucans.[31] Oomycete cell walls also
contain the amino_acid hydroxyproline, which is not found in fungal cell walls.
**** Slime molds ****
The dictyostelids are another group formerly classified among the fungi. They
are slime_molds that feed as unicellular amoebae, but aggregate into a
reproductive stalk and sporangium under certain conditions. Cells of the
reproductive stalk, as well as the spores formed at the apex, possess a
cellulose wall.[32] The spore wall has three layers, the middle one composed
primarily of cellulose, while the innermost is sensitive to cellulase and
pronase.[32]
***** Prokaryotic cell walls *****
**** Bacterial cell walls ****

a plasma_membrane, seen here in light brown, and a thick peptidoglycan-
containing cell wall (the purple layer). No outer_lipid_membrane is present, as
would be the case in gram-negative_bacteria. The red layer, known as the
capsule, is distinct from the cell envelope.
Further information: Cell_envelope and Bacterial_cell_structure
Around the outside of the cell membrane is the bacterial_cell_wall. Bacterial
cell walls are made of peptidoglycan (also called murein), which is made from
polysaccharide chains cross-linked by unusual peptides containing D-amino
acids.[33] Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and
fungi which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively.[34] The cell wall
of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain
peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria,
although L-form_bacteria can be produced in the laboratory that lack a cell
wall.[35] The antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by preventing the
cross-linking of peptidoglycan and this causes the cell wall to weaken and
lyse.[34] The lysozyme enzyme can also damage bacterial cell walls.
There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, called
gram-positive and gram-negative. The names originate from the reaction of cells
to the Gram_stain, a test long-employed for the classification of bacterial
species.[36]
Gram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of
peptidoglycan and teichoic_acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a
relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan
surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and
lipoproteins. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall and only the
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (previously known as the low G+C and high G+C
gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have the alternative gram-positive
arrangement.[37] These differences in structure can produce differences in
antibiotic susceptibility, for instance vancomycin can kill only gram-positive
bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as
Haemophilus_influenzae or Pseudomonas_aeruginosa.[38]
**** Archaeal cell walls ****
Although not truly unique, the cell walls of Archaea are unusual. Whereas
peptidoglycan is a standard component of all bacterial cell walls, all archaeal
cell walls lack peptidoglycan,[39] though some methanogens have a cell wall
made of a similar polymer called pseudopeptidoglycan.[11] There are four types
of cell wall currently known among the Archaea.
One type of archaeal cell wall is that composed of pseudopeptidoglycan (also
called pseudomurein). This type of wall is found in some methanogens, such as
Methanobacterium and Methanothermus.[40] While the overall structure of
archaeal pseudopeptidoglycan superficially resembles that of bacterial
peptidoglycan, there are a number of significant chemical differences. Like the
peptidoglycan found in bacterial cell walls, pseudopeptidoglycan consists of
polymer chains of glycan cross-linked by short peptide connections. However,
unlike peptidoglycan, the sugar N-acetylmuramic_acid is replaced by N-
acetyltalosaminuronic_acid,[39] and the two sugars are bonded with a Î²,1-
3 glycosidic linkage instead of Î²,1-4. Additionally, the cross-linking
peptides are L-amino_acids rather than D-amino acids as they are in bacteria.
[40]
A second type of archaeal cell wall is found in Methanosarcina and Halococcus.
This type of cell wall is composed entirely of a thick layer of
polysaccharides, which may be sulfated in the case of Halococcus.[40] Structure
in this type of wall is complex and not fully investigated.
A third type of wall among the Archaea consists of glycoprotein, and occurs in
the hyperthermophiles, Halobacterium, and some methanogens. In Halobacterium,
the proteins in the wall have a high content of acidic amino_acids, giving the
wall an overall negative charge. The result is an unstable structure that is
stabilized by the presence of large quantities of positive sodium ions that
neutralize the charge.[40] Consequently, Halobacterium thrives only under
conditions with high salinity.
In other Archaea, such as Methanomicrobium and Desulfurococcus, the wall may be
composed only of surface-layer proteins,[11] known as an S-layer. S-layers are
common in bacteria, where they serve as either the sole cell-wall component or
an outer layer in conjunction with polysaccharides. Most Archaea are Gram-
negative, though at least one Gram-positive member is known.[11]
***** Other cell coverings *****
Many protists and bacteria produce other cell surface structures apart from
cell walls, external (extracellular_matrix) or internal.[41][42][43] Many algae
have a sheath or envelope of mucilage outside the cell made of
exopolysaccharides. Diatoms build a frustule from silica extracted from the
surrounding water; radiolarians, foraminiferans, testate_amoebae and
silicoflagellates also produce a skeleton from minerals, called test in some
groups. Many green_algae, such as Halimeda and the Dasycladales, and some red
algae, the Corallinales, encase their cells in a secreted skeleton of calcium
carbonate. In each case, the wall is rigid and essentially inorganic. It is the
non-living component of cell. Some golden_algae, ciliates and choanoflagellates
produces a shell-like protective outer covering called lorica. Some
dinoflagellates have a theca of cellulose plates, and coccolithophorids have
coccoliths.
An extracellular_matrix (ECM) is also present in metazoans. Its composition
varies between cells, but collagens are the most abundant protein in the ECM.
