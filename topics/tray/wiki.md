Brass tray inlaid with silver, Egypt or Syria, 19th century
A tray is a shallow platform designed for the carrying of items. It can be
fashioned from numerous materials, including silver, brass, sheet iron,
paperboard, wood, melamine, and molded_pulp. Trays range in cost from
inexpensive molded pulp trays which are disposable and inexpensive melamine
trays used in cafeterias, to mid-priced wooden trays used in a home, to
expensive silver trays used in luxury hotels. Some examples have raised
galleries, handles, and short feet for support.
Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off them.
They are made in a range of shapes but are commonly found in oval or
rectangular forms, sometimes with cutout or attached handles with which to
carry them.
A more elaborate device is the tray table, which is designed to accommodate a
tray, or to serve as a tray itself. There are two primary kinds of tray tables.
The TV_tray_table is typically a small table, which may have legs that fold to
allow it to be carried like a tray. The airplane tray table is a tray built
into the back of an airline_seat, which folds down so that the person sitting
in the seat behind the one containing the table can use it as a surface from
which to eat meals served on the airplane.
