The ISO 9000 family of quality_management_systems (QMS) standards is designed
to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other
stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a
product or service.[1] ISO 9000 deals with the fundamentals of quality
management systems,[2] including the seven quality management principles upon
which the family of standards is based.[2] [3][4] ISO 9001 deals with the
requirements that organizations wishing to meet the standard must fulfill.[5]
Third-party certification bodies provide independent confirmation that
organisations meet the requirements of ISO 9001. Over one million organisations
worldwide[6] are independently certified, making ISO 9001 one of the most
widely used management tools in the world today. However, the ISO certification
process has been criticised[7][8] as being wasteful and not being useful for
all organizations.[9][10]

***** Background[edit] *****
ISO 9000 was first published in 1987 by ISO (International_Organisation_for
Standardization).[11] It was based on the BS 5750 series of standards from BSI
that were proposed to ISO in 1979.[12] However, its history can be traced back
some twenty years before that, to the publication of government procurement
standards, such as the United_States_Department_of_Defense MIL-Q-9858 standard
in 1959, and the UK's Def Stan 05-21 and 05-24. Large organizations which
supplied government procurement agencies often had to comply with a variety of
quality assurance requirements for each contract awarded which led the defence
industry to adopt mutual recognition of NATO AQAP, MIL-Q and Def Stan
standards. Eventually, ISO 9000 was adopted as a suitable option, instead of
forcing contractors to adopt multiple - and often similar - requirements.[13]
***** Reasons for use[edit] *****
The global adoption of ISO 9001 may be attributable to a number of factors. In
the early days, the ISO 9001 (9002 and 9003) requirements were intended to be
used by procuring organizations[clarification_needed], as the basis of
contractual arrangements with their suppliers. This helped reduce the need for
"supplier development"[vague] by establishing basic requirements for a supplier
to assure product quality. The ISO 9001 requirements could be tailored to meet
specific contractual situations, depending on the complexity of product,
business type (design responsibility, manufacture only, distribution, servicing
etc.) and risk to the procurer. If a chosen supplier was weak on the controls
of their measurement equipment (calibration), and hence QC/inspection results,
that specific requirement would be invoked in the contract. The adoption of a
single Quality Assurance requirement also lead to cost savings throughout the
supply chain by reducing the administrative burden of maintaining multiple sets
of quality manuals and procedures.
A few years later, the UK Government took steps to improve national
competitiveness following publication of cmd 8621, and Third Party
Certification of Quality Management Systems was born, under the auspices of the
National Accreditation Council of Certification Bodies (NACCB) which has become
the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) .
In addition to many stakeholders' benefits, a number of studies have identified
significant financial benefits for organizations certified to ISO 9001, with a
2011 survey from the British Assessment Bureau showing 44% of their certified
clients had won new business.[14] Corbett et al. showed that certified
organizations achieved superior return_on_assets[15] compared to otherwise
similar organizations without certification.[16] Heras et al. found similarly
superior performance[16] and demonstrated that this was statistically
significant and not a function of organization size.[17] Naveha and Marcus
claimed that implementing ISO 9001 led to superior operational performance in
the U.S._automotive_industry.[18] Sharma identified similar improvements in
operating performance and linked this to superior financial performance.[19]
Chow-Chua et al. showed better overall financial performance was achieved for
companies in Denmark.[20] Rajan and Tamimi (2003) showed that ISO 9001
certification resulted in superior stock market performance and suggested that
shareholders were richly rewarded for the investment in an ISO 9001 system.[21]
While the connection between superior financial performance and ISO 9001 may be
seen from the examples cited, there remains no proof of direct causation,
though longitudinal_studies, such as those of Corbett et al. (2005)[16] may
suggest it. Other writers, such as Heras et al. (2002),[17] have suggested that
while there is some evidence of this, the improvement is partly driven by the
fact that there is a tendency for better performing companies to seek ISO 9001
certification.
The mechanism for improving results has also been the subject of much research.
Lo et al. (2007) identified operational improvements (e.g., cycle time
reduction, inventory reductions) as following from certification.[22] Internal
process improvements in organizations lead to externally observable
improvements.[23][24] The benefit of increased international trade and domestic
market share, in addition to the internal benefits such as customer
satisfaction, interdepartmental communications, work processes, and customer/
supplier partnerships derived, far exceeds any and all initial investment.[25]

***** ISO 9000 series Quality Management Principles[edit] *****
The ISO 9000 series are based on seven quality management principles (QMP)[33]
The seven quality management principles are:
    * QMP 1 â Customer focus
    * QMP 2 â Leadership
    * QMP 3 â Engagement of people
    * QMP 4 â Process approach
    * QMP 5 â Improvement
    * QMP 6 â Evidence-based decision making
    * QMP 7 â Relationship management
Principle 1 â Customer focus
      Organizations depend on their customers and therefore should understand
      current and future customer needs, should meet customer requirements and
      strive to exceed customer expectations.
Principle 2 â Leadership
      Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization.
      They should create and maintain the internal environment in which people
      can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives.
Principle 3 â Engagement of people
      People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full
      involvement enables their abilities to be used for the organization's
      benefit.
Principle 4 â Process approach
      A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related
      resources are managed as a process.
Principle 5 â Improvement
      Improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a
      permanent objective of the organization.
Principle 6 â Evidence-based decision making
      Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.
Principle 7 â Relationship management
      An organization and its external providers (suppliers, contractors,
      service providers) are interdependent and a mutually beneficial
      relationship enhances the ability of both to create value.
***** Contents of ISO 9001:2015[edit] *****
A fish wholesaler in Tsukiji, Japan advertising its ISO 9001 certification.
ISO 9001:2015 Quality management systems â Requirements is a document of
approximately 30 pages which is available from the national standards
organization in each country. Only ISO 9001 is directly audited against for
third party assessment purposes.
Contents of ISO 9001:2015 are as follows:
    * Section 1: Scope
    * Section 2: Normative references
    * Section 3: Terms and definitions
    * Section 4: Context of the organization
    * Section 5: Leadership
    * Section 6: Planning
    * Section 7: Support
    * Section 8: Operation
    * Section 9: Performance evaluation
    * Section 10: Continual Improvement
Essentially, the layout of the standard is similar to the previous ISO 9001:
2008 standard in that it follows the Plan,_Do,_Check,_Act cycle in a process-
based approach but is now further encouraging this to have risk-based thinking
(section 0.3.3 of the introduction). The purpose of the quality objectives is
to determine the conformity of the requirements (customers and organizations),
facilitate effective deployment and improve the quality management system.[34]
[35]
Before the certification body can issue or renew a certificate, the auditor
must be satisfied that the company being assessed has implemented the
requirements of sections 4 to 10. Sections 1 to 3 are not directly audited
against, but because they provide context and definitions for the rest of the
standard, not that of the organization, their contents must be taken into
account.
The standard no longer specifies that the organization shall issue and maintain
documented procedures, however, ISO 9001:2015 requires the organization to
document any other procedures required for its effective operation. The
standard also requires the organization to issue and communicate a documented
quality_policy, a quality management system scope, and quality objectives. The
standard no longer requires compliant organizations to issue a formal Quality
Manual. The standard does require retention of numerous records, as specified
throughout the standard. New for the 2015 release is a requirement for an
organization to assess risks and opportunities (section 6.1) and to determine
internal and external issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction
(section 4.1). The organization must demonstrate how the standard's
requirements are being met, while the external auditor's role is to determine
the quality management system's effectiveness. More detailed interpretation and
implementation examples are often sought by organizations seeking more
information in what can be a very technical area.
***** Certification[edit] *****
The International_Organization_for_Standardization (ISO) does not certify
organisations itself. Numerous certification bodies exist, which audit
organisations and, upon success, issue ISO 9001 compliance certificates.
Although commonly referred to as "ISO 9000" certification, the actual standard
to which an organization's quality management system can be certified is ISO
9001:2015 (ISO 9001:2008 expired around September 2018). Many countries have
formed accreditation bodies to authorize ("accredit") the certification bodies.
Both the accreditation bodies and the certification bodies charge fees for
their services. The various accreditation bodies have mutual agreements with
each other to ensure that certificates issued by one of the accredited
certification_bodies (CB) are accepted worldwide. Certification bodies
themselves operate under another quality standard, ISO/IEC 17021,[36] while
accreditation bodies operate under ISO/IEC 17011.[37]
An organization applying for ISO 9001 certification is audited based on an
extensive sample of its sites, functions, products, services and processes. The
auditor presents a list of problems (defined as "nonconformities",
"observations", or "opportunities for improvement") to management. If there are
no major nonconformities, the certification body will issue a certificate.
Where major nonconformities are identified, the organization will present an
improvement plan to the certification body (e.g., corrective action reports
showing how the problems will be resolved); once the certification body is
satisfied that the organization has carried out sufficient corrective action,
it will issue a certificate. The certificate is limited by a certain scope
(e.g., production of golf balls) and will display the addresses to which the
certificate refers.
An ISO 9001 certificate is not a once-and-for-all award but must be renewed at
regular intervals recommended by the certification body, usually once every
three years. There are no grades of competence within ISO 9001: either a
company is certified (meaning that it is committed to the method and model of
quality management described in the standard) or it is not. In this respect,
ISO 9001 certification contrasts with measurement-based quality systems.
***** Evolution of ISO 9000 standards[edit] *****
The ISO 9000 standard is continually being revised by standing technical
committees and advisory groups, who receive feedback from those professionals
who are implementing the standard.
**** 1987 version[edit] ****
ISO 9000:1987 had the same structure as the UK Standard BS 5750, with three
"models" for quality management systems, the selection of which was based on
the scope of activities of the organization:
    * ISO 9001:1987 Model for quality assurance in design, development,
      production, installation, and servicing was for companies and
      organizations whose activities included the creation of new products.
    * ISO 9002:1987 Model for quality assurance in production, installation,
      and servicing had basically the same material as ISO 9001 but without
      covering the creation of new products.
    * ISO 9003:1987 Model for quality assurance in final inspection and test
      covered only the final inspection of finished product, with no concern
      for how the product was produced.
ISO 9000:1987 was also influenced by existing U.S. and other Defense_Standards
("MIL SPECS"), and so was well-suited to manufacturing. The emphasis tended to
be placed on conformance with procedures rather than the overall process of
management, which was likely the actual intent.[citation_needed]
**** 1994 version[edit] ****
ISO 9000:1994 emphasized quality_assurance via preventive actions, instead of
just checking final product, and continued to require evidence of compliance
with documented procedures. As with the first edition, the down-side was that
companies tended to implement its requirements by creating shelf-loads of
procedure manuals, and becoming burdened with an ISO bureaucracy. In some
companies, adapting and improving processes could actually be impeded by the
quality system.[citation_needed]
**** 2000 version[edit] ****
ISO 9001:2000 replaced all three former standards of 1994 issue, ISO 9001, ISO
9002 and ISO 9003. Design and development procedures were required only if a
company does, in fact, engage in the creation of new products. The 2000 version
sought to make a radical change in thinking by actually placing front and
centre the concept of process_management (the monitoring and optimisation of a
company's tasks and activities, instead of just inspection of the final
product). The 2000 version also demanded involvement by upper executives in
order to integrate quality into the business system and avoid delegation of
quality functions to junior administrators. Another goal was to improve
effectiveness via process performance metrics: numerical measurement of the
effectiveness of tasks and activities. Expectations of continual process
improvement and tracking customer satisfaction were made explicit.
ISO 9000 Requirements include:
    * Approve documents before distribution;
    * Provide correct version of documents at points of use;
    * Use your records to prove that requirements have been met; and
    * Develop a procedure to control your records.
**** 2008 version[edit] ****
ISO 9001:2008 in essence re-narrates ISO 9001:2000. The 2008 version only
introduced clarifications to the existing requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and
some changes intended to improve consistency with ISO_14001:2004. There were no
new requirements. For example, in ISO 9001:2008, a quality management system
being upgraded just needs to be checked to see if it is following the
clarifications introduced in the amended version.
ISO 9001 is supplemented directly by two other standards of the family:
    * ISO 9000:2005 "Quality management systems. Fundamentals and vocabulary"
    * ISO 9004:2009 "Managing for the sustained success of an organization. A
      quality management approach"
Other standards, like ISO_19011 and the ISO 10000 series, may also be used for
specific parts of the quality system.
**** 2015 version[edit] ****
In 2012, ISO TC 176 - responsible for ISO 9001 development - celebrated 25
years of implementing ISO 9001,[38] and concluded that it was necessary to
create a new QMS model for the next 25 years. They subsequently commenced the
official work on creating a revision of ISO 9001, starting with the new QM
principles. This moment was considered by important specialists in the field as
"beginning of a new era in the development of quality management systems."[39]
As a result of the intensive work from this technical committee, the revised
standard ISO 9001:2015 was published by ISO on 23 September 2015. The scope of
the standard has not changed; however, the structure and core terms were
modified to allow the standard to integrate more easily with other
international management systems standards.[40]
The new ISO 9001:2015 management system standard helps ensure that consumers
get reliable, desired quality goods and services. This further increases
benefits for a business.[41]
The 2015 version is also less prescriptive than its predecessors and focuses on
performance. This was achieved by combining the process approach with risk-
based thinking, and employing the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle at all levels in the
organization.[42]
Some of the key changes include:
    * High-Level Structure of 10 clauses is implemented. Now all new standards
      released by ISO will have this high-level structure
    * Greater emphasis on building a management system suited to each
      organization's particular needs
    * A requirement that those at the top of an organization be involved and
      accountable, aligning quality with wider business strategy
    * Risk-based thinking throughout the standard makes the whole management
      system a preventive tool and encourages continuous improvement
    * Less prescriptive requirements for documentation: the organisation can
      now decide what documented information it needs and what format it should
      be in
    * Alignment with other key management system standards through the use of a
      common structure and core text[43]
    * Inclusion of Knowledge Management principles
    * Quality Manual & Management representative (MR) are no longer mandatory
***** Auditing[edit] *****
Two types of auditing are required to become registered to the standard:
auditing by an external certification body (external audit) and audits by
internal staff trained for this process (internal audits). The aim is a
continual process of review and assessment to verify that the system is working
as it is supposed to, to find out where it can improve, and to correct or
prevent identified problems. It is considered healthier for internal auditors
to audit outside their usual management line, so as to bring a degree of
independence to their judgements.
***** Industry-specific interpretations[edit] *****
The ISO 9001 standard is generic; its parts must be carefully interpreted to
make sense within a particular organization. Developing_software is not like
making cheese or offering counseling services, yet the ISO 9001 guidelines,
because they are business management guidelines, can be applied to each of
these. Diverse organizationsâpolice departments (United States), professional
soccer teams (Mexico), and city councils (UK)âhave successfully implemented
ISO 9001:2000 systems.
Over time, various industry sectors have wanted to standardise their
interpretations of the guidelines within their own marketplace. This is partly
to ensure that their versions of ISO 9000 have their specific requirements, but
also to try and ensure that more appropriately trained and experienced auditors
are sent to assess them.
    * The TickIT guidelines are an interpretation of ISO 9000 produced by the
      UK Board of Trade to suit the processes of the information technology
      industry, especially software development.
    * AS9000 is the Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard, an interpretation
      developed by major aerospace manufacturers. Those major manufacturers
      include AlliedSignal, Allison Engine, Boeing, General Electric Aircraft
      Engines, Lockheed-Martin, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Grumman, Pratt &
      Whitney, Rockwell-Collins, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Sundstrand. The current
      version is AS9100D.
    * PS 9000 * QS 9000 is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive
      manufacturers (GM, Ford, Chrysler). It includes techniques such as FMEA
      and APQP. QS 9000 is now replaced by ISO/TS 16949.
    * ISO/TS_16949:2009 is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive
      manufacturers (American and European manufacturers); the latest version
      is based on ISO 9001:2008. The emphasis on a process approach is stronger
      than in ISO 9001:2008. ISO/TS 16949:2009 contains the full text of ISO
      9001:2008 and automotive industry-specific requirements. After the new
      edition of ISO 9001:2015 the ISO/TS 16949:2009 was also completely
      revised and reissued by IATF (International Automotive Task Force) IATF
      16949:2016 is now a stand-alone standard which doesn't include the ISO
      9001:2015 requirements but still refer to them and works as additional
      automotive specific requirement to ISO 9001.
    * TL_9000 is the Telecom Quality Management and Measurement System
      Standard, an interpretation developed by the telecom consortium, QuEST
      Forum. In 1998 QuEST Forum developed the TL 9000 Quality Management
      System to meet the supply chain quality requirements of the worldwide
      telecommunications industry. The TL 9000 standard is made up of two
      handbooks: the QMS Requirements Handbook, and the QMS Measurement
      Handbook. The current versions of the Requirements and Measurements
      Handbooks are 5.0. Unlike ISO 9001 or other sector-specific standards, TL
      9000 includes standardized product and process measurements that must be
      reported into a central repository, which allows organizations to
      benchmark their performance in key process areas against peer
      organizations. It is important to note that TL 9000 R5.0 contains the
      full text of ISO 9001:2008.
    * ISO_13485:2016 is the medical industry's equivalent of ISO 9001. ISO
      13485:2016 is a stand-alone standard. Because ISO 13485 is relevant to
      medical devices manufacturers (unlike ISO 9001, which is applicable to
      any industry), and because of the differences between the two standards
      relating to continual improvement, compliance with ISO 13485 does not
      necessarily mean compliance with ISO 9001 (and vice versa).
    * ISO/IEC_90003:2014 provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001 to
      computer software.
    * ISO/TS_29001 is quality management system requirements for the design,
      development, production, installation, and service of products for the
      petroleum, petrochemical, and natural gas industries. It is equivalent to
      API Spec Q1 without the Monogram annex.
    * ISO_22000 Food Safety Management Systems.

   1. Are the quality principles in ISO 9001 of value?
   2. Does it help to implement an ISO 9001-compliant quality management
      system?
   3. Does it help to obtain ISO 9001 certification?
The effectiveness of the ISO system being implemented depends on a number of
factors, the most significant of which are:
   1. Commitment of senior management to monitor, control, and improve quality.
      Organizations that implement an ISO system without this desire and
      commitment often take the cheapest road to get a certificate on the wall
      and ignore problem areas uncovered in the audits.
   2. How well the ISO system integrates into current business practices. Many
      organizations that implement ISO try to make their system fit into a
      cookie-cutter quality manual instead of creating a manual that documents
      existing practices and only adds new processes to meet the ISO standard
      when necessary.
   3. How well the ISO system focuses on improving the customer experience. The
      broadest definition of quality is "Whatever the customer perceives good
      quality to be." This means that a company doesn't necessarily have to
      make a product that never fails; some customers will have a higher
      tolerance for product failures if they always receive shipments on-time
      or have a positive experience in some other dimension of customer
      service. An ISO system should take into account all areas of the customer
      experience and the industry expectations, and seek to improve them on a
      continual basis. This means taking into account all processes that deal
      with the three stakeholders (customers, suppliers, and organization);
      only then will a company be able to sustain improvements in the
      customer's experience.
   4. How well the auditor finds and communicates areas of improvement. While
      ISO auditors may not provide consulting to the clients they audit, there
      is the potential for auditors to point out areas of improvement. Many
      auditors simply rely on submitting reports that indicate compliance or
      non-compliance with the appropriate section of the standard; however, to
      most executives, this is like speaking a foreign language. Auditors that
      can clearly identify and communicate areas for improvement in language
      and terms executive management understands facilitate action on
      improvement initiatives by the companies they audit. When management
      doesn't understand why they were non-compliant and the business
      implications associated with non-compliance, they simply ignore the
      reports and focus on what they do understand.
**** Advantages[edit] ****
Proper quality management can improve business, often having a positive effect
on investment, market share, sales growth, sales margins, competitive
advantage, and avoidance of litigation.[44] The quality principles in ISO 9000:
2000 are also sound, according to Wade [45] and Barnes, who says that "ISO 9000
guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that
can make any company competitive".[46] Sroufe and Curkovic, (2008) found
benefits ranging from registration required to remain part of a supply base,
better documentation, to cost benefits, and improved involvement and
communication with management.[44] According to ISO[47] the 2015 version of the
standard brings the following benefits:
   1. By assessing their context, organizations can define who is affected by
      their work and what they expect. This enables clearly stated business
      objectives and the identification of new business opportunities.
   2. Organizations can identify and address the risks associated with their
      organization.
   3. By putting customers first, organizations can make sure they consistently
      meet customer needs and enhance customer satisfaction. This can lead to
      more repeat customers, new clients and increased business for the
      organization.
   4. Organizations work in a more efficient way as all their processes are
      aligned and understood by everyone. This increases productivity and
      efficiency, bringing internal costs down.
   5. Organizations will meet necessary statutory and regulatory requirements.
   6. Organizations can expand into new markets, as some sectors and clients
      require ISO 9001 before doing business.
**** Criticisms of ISO 9001 certification[edit] ****
A common criticism of ISO 9000 and 9001 is the amount of money, time, and
paperwork required for a complete implementation, and later when needed; ISO
9001 certification.[7] Dalgleish cites the "inordinate and often unnecessary
paperwork burden" of ISO, and says that "quality managers feel that ISO's
overhead and paperwork are excessive and extremely inefficient".[48] The level
of minimum documentation for a minimum scope organization has been greatly
reduced, going from ISO 9001:2000 to ISO 9001:2008 to ISO 9001:2015.[citation
needed]
According to Barnes, "Opponents claim that it is only for documentation.
Proponents believe that if a company has documented its quality systems, then
most of the paperwork has already been completed".[46] Wilson suggests that ISO
standards "elevate inspection of the correct procedures over broader aspects of
quality", and therefore, "the workplace becomes oppressive and quality is not
improved".[8]
One study showing reasons for not adopting this standard include the risks and
uncertainty of not knowing if there are direct relationships to improved
quality, and what kind and how many resources will be needed. Additional risks
include how much certification will cost, increased bureaucratic processes and
risk of poor company image if the certification process fails.[44] According to
John_Seddon, ISO 9001 promotes specification, control, and procedures rather
than understanding and improvement.[9] Wade argues that ISO 9000 is effective
as a guideline, but that promoting it as a standard "helps to mislead companies
into thinking that certification means better quality, ... [undermining] the
need for an organization to set its own quality standards".[45] In short, Wade
argues that reliance on the specifications of ISO 9001 does not guarantee a
successful quality system.
The standard is seen as especially prone to failure when a company is
interested in certification before quality.[9] Certifications are in fact often
based on customer contractual requirements rather than a desire to actually
improve quality.[46][49] "If you just want the certificate on the wall, chances
are you will create a paper system that doesn't have much to do with the way
you actually run your business", said ISO's Roger Frost.[49] Certification by
an independent auditor is often seen as the problem area, and according to
Barnes, "has become a vehicle to increase consulting services".[46]
Dalgleish argues that while "quality has a positive effect on return on
investment, market share, sales growth, better sales margins and competitive
advantage," "taking a quality approach is unrelated to ISO 9000 registration."
[50] In fact, ISO itself advises that ISO 9001 can be implemented without
certification, simply for the quality benefits that can be achieved.[51]
Abrahamson argues that fashionable management discourse such as Quality_Circles
tends to follow a lifecycle in the form of a bell_curve, possibly indicating a
management_fad.[52]
Pickrell argues[citation_needed] that ISO systems merely gauge whether the
processes are being followed. It does not gauge how good the processes are or
whether the correct parameters are being measured and controlled to ensure
quality. Furthermore, when unique technical solutions are involved in the
creation of a new part, ISO does not validate the robustness of the technical
solution which is a key part of advanced quality planning. It is not unheard of
for an ISO-certified plant to display poor quality performance due to poor
process selection and/or poor technical solutions.
