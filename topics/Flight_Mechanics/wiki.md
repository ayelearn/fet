Flight mechanics are relevant to fixed wing (gliders, aeroplanes) and rotary
wing (helicopters) aircraft. An aeroplane (airplane in US usage), is defined in
ICAO Document 9110 as, "a power-driven heavier than air aircraft, deriving its
lift chiefly from aerodynamic reactions on surface which remain fixed under
given conditions of flight".

***** Take-off[edit] *****
A heavier-than-air craft (aircraft) can only fly if a series of aerodynamic
forces come to bear. In regard to fixed wing aircraft, the fuselage of the
craft holds up the wings before takeoff. At the instant of takeoff, the reverse
happens and the wings support the plane in flight.
***** Straight and level flight of aircraft[edit] *****
Further information: Steady_flight_Â§ Steady_Flight_Maneuvers
In flight a powered aircraft can be considered as being acted on by four
forces: lift, weight, thrust, and drag.[1] Thrust is the force generated by the
engine (whether it be a jet or a propeller driven craft) and acts in a forward
direction for the purpose of overcoming drag.[2] Lift acts perpendicular to the
vector representing the aircraft's velocity relative to the atmosphere. Drag
acts parallel to the aircraft's velocity vector, but in the opposite direction
because drag resists motion through the air. Weight acts through the aircraft's
centre_of_gravity, towards the centre of the Earth.
In straight and level flight, lift is approximately equal to the weight, and
acts in the opposite direction. In addition, if the aircraft is not
accelerating, thrust is equal and opposite to drag.[3]
In straight climbing flight, lift is less than weight.[4] At first, this seems
incorrect because if an aircraft is climbing it seems lift must exceed weight.
When an aircraft is climbing at constant speed it is its thrust that enables it
to climb and gain extra potential energy. Lift acts perpendicular to the vector
representing the velocity of the aircraft relative to the atmosphere, so lift
is unable to alter the aircraft's potential energy or kinetic energy. This can
be seen by considering an aerobatic aircraft in straight vertical flight (one
that is climbing straight upwards or descending straight downwards). Vertical
flight requires no lift. When flying straight upwards the aircraft can reach
zero airspeed before falling earthwards; the wing is generating no lift and so
does not stall. In straight, climbing flight at constant airspeed, thrust
exceeds drag.
In straight descending flight, lift is less than weight.[5] In addition, if the
aircraft is not accelerating, thrust is less than drag. In turning flight, lift
exceeds weight and produces a load_factor greater than one, determined by the
aircraft's angle_of_bank.[6]
***** Aircraft control and movement[edit] *****
Main article: Flight_dynamics_(fixed-wing_aircraft)
There are three primary ways for an aircraft to change its orientation relative
to the passing air. Pitch (movement of the nose up or down, rotation around the
transversal axis), roll (rotation around the longitudinal axis, that is, the
axis which runs along the length of the aircraft) and yaw (movement of the nose
to left or right, rotation about the vertical axis). Turning the aircraft
(change of heading) requires the aircraft firstly to roll to achieve an angle
of bank (in order to produce a centripetal force); when the desired change of
heading has been accomplished the aircraft must again be rolled in the opposite
direction to reduce the angle of bank to zero. Lift acts vertically up through
centre of pressure which depends on the position of wings. The position of the
centre of pressure will change with changes in the angle of attack and aircraft
wing flaps setting.
***** Aircraft control surfaces[edit] *****
Main article: Flight_control_surfaces
Yaw is induced by a moveable rudder-fin. The movement of the rudder changes the
size and orientation of the force the vertical surface produces. Since the
force is created at a distance behind the centre of gravity, this sideways
force causes a yawing moment then a yawing motion. On a large aircraft there
may be several independent rudders on the single fin for both safety and to
control the inter-linked yaw and roll actions.
Using yaw alone is not a very efficient way of executing a level turn in an
aircraft and will result in some sideslip. A precise combination of bank and
lift must be generated to cause the required centripetal forces without
producing a sideslip.
Pitch is controlled by the rear part of the tailplane's horizontal stabilizer
being hinged to create an elevator. By moving the elevator control backwards
the pilot moves the elevator up (a position of negative camber) and the
downwards force on the horizontal tail is increased. The angle_of_attack on the
wings increased so the nose is pitched up and lift is generally increased. In
micro-lights and hang_gliders the pitch action is reversedâthe pitch control
system is much simpler so when the pilot moves the elevator control backwards
it produces a nose-down pitch and the angle of attack on the wing is reduced.
The system of a fixed tail surface and moveable elevators is standard in
subsonic aircraft. Craft capable of supersonic flight often have a stabilator,
an all-moving tail surface. Pitch is changed in this case by moving the entire
horizontal surface of the tail. This seemingly simple innovation was one of the
key technologies that made supersonic flight possible. In early attempts, as
pilots exceeded the critical_Mach_number, a strange phenomenon made their
control surfaces useless, and their aircraft uncontrollable. It was determined
that as an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air approaching the
aircraft is compressed and shock waves begin to form at all the leading edges
and around the hinge lines of the elevator. These shock waves caused movements
of the elevator to cause no pressure change on the stabilizer upstream of the
elevator. The problem was solved by changing the stabilizer and hinged elevator
to an all-moving stabilizerâthe entire horizontal surface of the tail became
a one-piece control surface. Also, in supersonic flight the change in camber
has less effect on lift and a stabilator produces less drag[citation_needed].
Aircraft that need control at extreme angles of attack are sometimes fitted
with a canard configuration, in which pitching movement is created using a
forward foreplane (roughly level with the cockpit). Such a system produces an
immediate increase in pitch authority, and therefore a better response to pitch
controls. This system is common in delta-wing aircraft (deltaplane), which use
a stabilator-type canard foreplane. A disadvantage to a canard configuration
compared to an aft tail is that the wing cannot use as much extension of flaps
to increase wing lift at slow speeds due to stall performance. A combination
tri-surface aircraft uses both a canard and an aft tail (in addition to the
main wing) to achieve advantages of both configurations.
A further design of tailplane is the V-tail, so named because that instead of
the standard inverted T or T-tail, there are two fins angled away from each
other in a V. The control surfaces then act both as rudders and elevators,
moving in the appropriate direction as needed.
Roll is controlled by movable sections on the trailing edge of the wings called
ailerons. The ailerons move in opposition to one anotherâone goes up as the
other goes down. The difference in camber of the wing cause a difference in
lift and thus a rolling movement. As well as ailerons, there are sometimes also
spoilersâsmall hinged plates on the upper surface of the wing, originally
used to produce drag to slow the aircraft down and to reduce lift when
descending. On modern aircraft, which have the benefit of automation, they can
be used in combination with the ailerons to provide roll control.
The earliest powered aircraft built by the Wright_brothers did not have
ailerons. The whole wing was warped using wires. Wing warping is efficient
since there is no discontinuity in the wing geometry. But as speeds increased
unintentional warping became a problem and so ailerons were developed.
