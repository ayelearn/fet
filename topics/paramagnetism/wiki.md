Magnetic ordering
When liquid oxygen is poured from a beaker into a strong magnet, the oxygen is
temporarily contained between the magnetic poles owing to its paramagnetism.
Paramagnetism is a form of magnetism whereby some materials are weakly
attracted by an externally applied magnetic_field, and form internal, induced
magnetic_fields in the direction of the applied magnetic field. In contrast
with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and
form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied
magnetic field.[1] Paramagnetic materials include most chemical_elements and
some compounds;[2] they have a relative magnetic_permeability slightly greater
than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic_susceptibility) and hence are attracted
to magnetic fields. The magnetic_moment induced by the applied field is linear
in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive
analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic
materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.
Paramagnetism is due to the presence of unpaired_electrons in the material, so
all atoms with incompletely filled atomic_orbitals are paramagnetic. Due to
their spin, unpaired electrons have a magnetic_dipole_moment and act like tiny
magnets. An external magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align
parallel to the field, causing a net attraction. Paramagnetic materials include
aluminium, oxygen, titanium, and iron_oxide (FeO).
Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence
of an externally applied magnetic field because thermal_motion randomizes the
spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at
absolute_zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground_state, i.e. in the
absence of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the
applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a
small induced magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be
oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and
this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by
ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily
observed, for instance, in the attraction between a refrigerator_magnet and the
iron of the refrigerator itself.

***** Relation to electron spins[edit] *****
Constituent atoms or molecules of paramagnetic materials have permanent
magnetic moments (dipoles), even in the absence of an applied field. The
permanent moment generally is due to the spin of unpaired electrons in atomic
or molecular_electron_orbitals (see Magnetic_moment). In pure paramagnetism,
the dipoles do not interact with one another and are randomly oriented in the
absence of an external field due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net
magnetic moment. When a magnetic field is applied, the dipoles will tend to
align with the applied field, resulting in a net magnetic moment in the
direction of the applied field. In the classical description, this alignment
can be understood to occur due to a torque being provided on the magnetic
moments by an applied field, which tries to align the dipoles parallel to the
applied field. However, the true origins of the alignment can only be
understood via the quantum-mechanical properties of spin and angular_momentum.
If there is sufficient energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles, they will
interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains,
resulting in ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) or antiferromagnetism,
respectively. Paramagnetic behavior can also be observed in ferromagnetic
materials that are above their Curie_temperature, and in antiferromagnets above
their NÃ©el_temperature. At these temperatures, the available thermal energy
simply overcomes the interaction energy between the spins.
In general, paramagnetic effects are quite small: the magnetic_susceptibility
is of the order of 10â3 to 10â5 for most paramagnets, but may be as high as
10â1 for synthetic paramagnets such as ferrofluids.

In conductive materials, the electrons are delocalized, that is, they travel
through the solid more or less as free_electrons. Conductivity can be
understood in a band_structure picture as arising from the incomplete filling
of energy bands. In an ordinary nonmagnetic conductor the conduction band is
identical for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. When a magnetic field is
applied, the conduction band splits apart into a spin-up and a spin-down band
due to the difference in magnetic_potential_energy for spin-up and spin-down
electrons. Since the Fermi_level must be identical for both bands, this means
that there will be a small surplus of the type of spin in the band that moved
downwards. This effect is a weak form of paramagnetism known as Pauli
paramagnetism.
The effect always competes with a diamagnetic response of opposite sign due to
all the core electrons of the atoms. Stronger forms of magnetism usually
require localized rather than itinerant electrons. However, in some cases a
band structure can result in which there are two delocalized sub-bands with
states of opposite spins that have different energies. If one subband is
preferentially filled over the other, one can have itinerant ferromagnetic
order. This situation usually only occurs in relatively narrow (d-)bands, which
are poorly delocalized.
*** s and p electrons[edit] ***
Generally, strong delocalization in a solid due to large overlap with
neighboring wave functions means that there will be a large Fermi_velocity;
this means that the number of electrons in a band is less sensitive to shifts
in that band's energy, implying a weak magnetism. This is why s- and p-type
metals are typically either Pauli-paramagnetic or as in the case of gold even
diamagnetic. In the latter case the diamagnetic contribution from the closed
shell inner electrons simply wins over the weak paramagnetic term of the almost
free electrons.
*** d and f electrons[edit] ***
Stronger magnetic effects are typically only observed when d or f electrons are
involved. Particularly the latter are usually strongly localized. Moreover, the
size of the magnetic moment on a lanthanide atom can be quite large as it can
carry up to 7 unpaired electrons in the case of gadolinium(III) (hence its use
in MRI). The high magnetic moments associated with lanthanides is one reason
why superstrong_magnets are typically based on elements like neodymium or
samarium.
*** Molecular localization[edit] ***
The above picture is a generalization as it pertains to materials with an
extended lattice rather than a molecular structure. Molecular structure can
also lead to localization of electrons. Although there are usually energetic
reasons why a molecular structure results such that it does not exhibit partly
filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur
in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it
contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired
spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen p wave functions, but the overlap
is limited to the one neighbor in the O2 molecules. The distances to other
oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the
magnetic moments remain unpaired.
***** Theory[edit] *****
The Bohrâvan_Leeuwen_theorem proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or
paramagnetism in a purely classical system. The paramagnetic response has then
two possible quantum origins, either coming from permanents magnetic moments of
the ions or from the spatial motion of the conduction electrons inside the
material. Both description are given below.
**** Curie's law[edit] ****
Main article: Curie's_law
For low levels of magnetization, the magnetization of paramagnets follows what
is known as Curie's_law, at least approximately. This law indicates that the
susceptibility,      &#x03C7;    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \chi }  [
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \chi }], of paramagnetic materials is inversely
proportional to their temperature, i.e. that materials become more magnetic at
lower temperatures. The mathematical expression is:
          M  = &#x03C7;  H  =   C T    H    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol
      {M}}=\chi {\boldsymbol {H}}={\frac {C}{T}}{\boldsymbol {H}}}  [
      {\boldsymbol  {M}}=\chi {\boldsymbol  {H}}={\frac  {C}{T}}{\boldsymbol
      {H}}]
where:
         M   {\displaystyle M}  [M] is the resulting magnetization, measured in
      amperes/meter (A/m),
         &#x03C7;   {\displaystyle \chi }  [\chi ] is the volume_magnetic
      susceptibility (dimensionless),
         H   {\displaystyle H}  [H] is the auxiliary magnetic_field (A/m),
         T   {\displaystyle T}  [T] is absolute temperature, measured in
      kelvins (K),
         C   {\displaystyle C}  [C] is a material-specific Curie_constant (K).
Curie's law is valid under the commonly encountered conditions of low
magnetization (Î¼BH â² kBT), but does not apply in the high-field/low-
temperature regime where saturation of magnetization occurs (Î¼BH â³ kBT) and
magnetic dipoles are all aligned with the applied field. When the dipoles are
aligned, increasing the external field will not increase the total
magnetization since there can be no further alignment.
For a paramagnetic ion with noninteracting magnetic moments with angular
momentum J, the Curie constant is related the individual ions' magnetic
moments,
         C =   n  3  k   B        &#x03BC;   e f f    2    &#xA0;where&#xA0;
      &#x03BC;   e f f    =  g  J    &#x03BC;   B      J ( J + 1 )   .
      {\displaystyle C={\frac {n}{3k_{\mathrm {B} }}}\mu _{\mathrm {eff} }^{2}
      {\text{ where }}\mu _{\mathrm {eff} }=g_{J}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }{\sqrt {J
      (J+1)}}.}  [{\displaystyle C={\frac {n}{3k_{\mathrm {B} }}}\mu _{\mathrm
      {eff} }^{2}{\text{ where }}\mu _{\mathrm {eff} }=g_{J}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }
      {\sqrt {J(J+1)}}.}]
where n is the number of atoms per unit volume. The parameter Î¼eff is
interpreted as the effective magnetic moment per paramagnetic ion. If one uses
a classical treatment with molecular magnetic moments represented as discrete
magnetic dipoles, Î¼, a Curie Law expression of the same form will emerge with
Î¼ appearing in place of Î¼eff.
      Click "show" to see a derivation of this law:
      Curie's Law can be derived by considering a substance with noninteracting
      magnetic moments with angular momentum J. If orbital contributions to the
      magnetic moment are negligible (a common case), then in what follows J = S.
      If we apply a magnetic field along what we choose to call the z-axis, the
      energy levels of each paramagnetic center will experience Zeeman_splitting
      of its energy levels, each with a z-component labeled by MJ (or just MS for
      the spin-only magnetic case). Applying semiclassical Boltzmann_statistics,
      the magnetization of such a substance is

where Nu is the number of unpaired_electrons. In other transition metal
complexes this yields a useful, if somewhat cruder, estimate.
**** Pauli paramagnetism[edit] ****
For some alkali metals and noble metals, conductions electrons are weakly
interacting and delocalized in space forming a Fermi_gas. For these materials
one contribution to the magnetic response comes from the interaction between
the electron spins and the magnetic field known as Pauli paramagnetism. For a
small magnetic field      H    {\displaystyle \mathbf {H} }  [\mathbf{H}], the
additional energy per electron from the interaction between an electron spin
and the magnetic field is given by:
         &#x0394; E = &#x2212;  &#x03BC;  0    H  &#x22C5;   &#x03BC;   e   =
      &#x2213;  &#x03BC;  0    H  &#x22C5;  (  &#x2212;  g  e      &#x03BC;   B
      &#x210F;    S   )  = &#x00B1;  &#x03BC;  0    &#x03BC;   B    H ,
      {\displaystyle \Delta E=-\mu _{0}\mathbf {H} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\mu }}_
      {e}=\mp \mu _{0}\mathbf {H} \cdot \left(-g_{e}{\frac {\mu _{\mathrm {B}
      }}{\hbar }}\mathbf {S} \right)=\pm \mu _{0}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }H,}  [
      {\displaystyle \Delta E=-\mu _{0}\mathbf {H} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\mu }}_
      {e}=\mp \mu _{0}\mathbf {H} \cdot \left(-g_{e}{\frac {\mu _{\mathrm {B}
      }}{\hbar }}\mathbf {S} \right)=\pm \mu _{0}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }H,}]
where      &#x03BC;  0     {\displaystyle \mu _{0}}  [\mu _{0}] is the vacuum
permeability,       &#x03BC;   e     {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}_{e}}
[{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}_{e}}] is the electron_magnetic_moment,
&#x03BC;  B     {\displaystyle \mu _{B}}  [\mu _{B}] is the Bohr_magneton,
&#x210F;   {\displaystyle \hbar }  [\hbar ] is the reduced Planck constant, and
the g-factor cancels with the spin      S  = &#x00B1; &#x210F;  /  2
{\displaystyle \mathbf {S} =\pm \hbar /2}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {S} =\pm
\hbar /2}]. The     &#x00B1;   {\displaystyle \pm }  [\pm ] indicates that the
sign is positive (negative) when the electron spin component in the direction
of      H    {\displaystyle \mathbf {H} }  [\mathbf{H}] is parallel
(antiparallel) to the magnetic field.
In a metal, the application of an external magnetic field increases the density
of electrons with spins antiparallel with the field and lowers the density of
the electrons with opposite spin. Note: The arrows in this picture indicate
magnetic moment, not spin direction.
For low temperatures with respect to the Fermi_temperature      T  F
{\displaystyle T_{F}}  [{\displaystyle T_{F}}] (around 104 kelvins for metals),
the number_density of electrons      n  &#x2191;     {\displaystyle n_{\uparrow
}}  [{\displaystyle n_{\uparrow }}] (     n  &#x2193;     {\displaystyle n_
{\downarrow }}  [{\displaystyle n_{\downarrow }}]) pointing parallel
(antiparallel) to the magnetic field can be written as:
          n  &#x2191;   &#x2248;    n  e   2   &#x2212;     &#x03BC;  0
      &#x03BC;   B     2   g (  E   F    ) H  ;   (   n  &#x2193;   &#x2248;
      n  e   2   +     &#x03BC;  0    &#x03BC;   B     2   g (  E   F    ) H  )
      ,   {\displaystyle n_{\uparrow }\approx {\frac {n_{e}}{2}}-{\frac {\mu _
      {0}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }}{2}}g(E_{\mathrm {F} })H\quad ;\quad \left(n_
      {\downarrow }\approx {\frac {n_{e}}{2}}+{\frac {\mu _{0}\mu _{\mathrm {B}
      }}{2}}g(E_{\mathrm {F} })H\right),}  [{\displaystyle n_{\uparrow }\approx
      {\frac {n_{e}}{2}}-{\frac {\mu _{0}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }}{2}}g(E_{\mathrm
      {F} })H\quad ;\quad \left(n_{\downarrow }\approx {\frac {n_{e}}{2}}+
      {\frac {\mu _{0}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }}{2}}g(E_{\mathrm {F} })H\right),}]
with      n  e     {\displaystyle n_{e}}  [n_{e}] the total free-electrons
density and     g (  E   F    )   {\displaystyle g(E_{\mathrm {F} })}  [
{\displaystyle g(E_{\mathrm {F} })}] the electronic density of states (number
of states per energy per volume) at the Fermi_energy      E   F
{\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {F} }}  [{\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {F} }}].
In this approximation the magnetization is given as the magnetic moment of one
electron times the difference in densities:
         M =  &#x03BC;   B    (  n  &#x2193;   &#x2212;  n  &#x2191;   ) =
      &#x03BC;  0    &#x03BC;   B    2   g (  E   F    ) H ,   {\displaystyle
      M=\mu _{\mathrm {B} }(n_{\downarrow }-n_{\uparrow })=\mu _{0}\mu _
      {\mathrm {B} }^{2}g(E_{\mathrm {F} })H,}  [{\displaystyle M=\mu _{\mathrm
      {B} }(n_{\downarrow }-n_{\uparrow })=\mu _{0}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }^{2}g(E_
      {\mathrm {F} })H,}]
which yields a positive paramagnetic susceptibility independent of temperature:
          &#x03C7;   P    =  &#x03BC;  0    &#x03BC;   B    2   g (  E   F    )
      .   {\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {P} }=\mu _{0}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }^{2}g
      (E_{\mathrm {F} }).}  [{\displaystyle \chi _{\mathrm {P} }=\mu _{0}\mu _
      {\mathrm {B} }^{2}g(E_{\mathrm {F} }).}]
The Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility is a macroscopic effect and has to be
contrasted with Landau_diamagnetic_susceptibility which is equal to minus one
third of Pauli's and also comes from delocalized electrons. The Pauli
susceptibility comes from the spin interaction with the magnetic field while
the Landau susceptibility comes from the spatial motion of the electrons and it
is independent of the spin. In doped semiconductors the ratio between Landau's
and Pauli's susceptibilities changes as the effective_mass of the charge
carriers      m  &#x2217;     {\displaystyle m^{*}}  [m^{*}] can differ from
the electron mass      m  e     {\displaystyle m_{e}}  [m_{e}].
The magnetic response calculated for a gas of electrons is not the full picture
as the magnetic susceptibility coming from the ions has to be included.
Additionally, this formulas may break down for confined systems that differ
from the bulk, like quantum_dots, or for high fields, as demonstrated in the de
Haas-van_Alphen_effect.
Pauli paramagnetism is named after the physicist Wolfgang_Pauli. Before Pauli's
theory, the lack of a strong Curie paramagnetism in metals was an open problem
as the leading_model could not account for this contribution without the use of
quantum_statistics.
***** Examples of paramagnets[edit] *****
Materials that are called "paramagnets" are most often those that exhibit, at
least over an appreciable temperature range, magnetic susceptibilities that
adhere to the Curie or CurieâWeiss laws. In principle any system that
contains atoms, ions, or molecules with unpaired spins can be called a
paramagnet, but the interactions between them need to be carefully considered.
**** Systems with minimal interactions[edit] ****
The narrowest definition would be: a system with unpaired spins that do not
interact with each other. In this narrowest sense, the only pure paramagnet is
a dilute gas of monatomic_hydrogen atoms. Each atom has one non-interacting
unpaired electron.
A gas of lithium atoms already possess two paired core electrons that produce a
diamagnetic response of opposite sign. Strictly speaking Li is a mixed system
therefore, although admittedly the diamagnetic component is weak and often
neglected. In the case of heavier elements the diamagnetic contribution becomes
more important and in the case of metallic gold it dominates the properties.
The element hydrogen is virtually never called 'paramagnetic' because the
monatomic gas is stable only at extremely high temperature; H atoms combine to
form molecular H2 and in so doing, the magnetic moments are lost (quenched),
because of the spins pair. Hydrogen is therefore diamagnetic and the same holds
true for many other elements. Although the electronic configuration of the
individual atoms (and ions) of most elements contain unpaired spins, they are
not necessarily paramagnetic, because at ambient temperature quenching is very
much the rule rather than the exception. The quenching tendency is weakest for
f-electrons because f (especially 4f) orbitals are radially contracted and they
overlap only weakly with orbitals on adjacent atoms. Consequently, the
lanthanide elements with incompletely filled 4f-orbitals are paramagnetic or
magnetically ordered.[4]

(NH4)2[Mn(SO4)2]Â·6H25.92
NH4[Fe(SO4)2]Â·12H2O 5.89
Thus, condensed phase paramagnets are only possible if the interactions of the
spins that lead either to quenching or to ordering are kept at bay by
structural isolation of the magnetic centers. There are two classes of
materials for which this holds:
    * Molecular materials with a (isolated) paramagnetic center.
          o Good examples are coordination_complexes of d- or f-metals or
            proteins with such centers, e.g. myoglobin. In such materials the
            organic part of the molecule acts as an envelope shielding the
            spins from their neighbors.
          o Small molecules can be stable in radical form, oxygen O2 is a good
            example. Such systems are quite rare because they tend to be rather
            reactive.
    * Dilute systems.
          o Dissolving a paramagnetic species in a diamagnetic lattice at small
            concentrations, e.g. Nd3+ in CaCl2 will separate the neodymium ions
            at large enough distances that they do not interact. Such systems
            are of prime importance for what can be considered the most
            sensitive method to study paramagnetic systems: EPR.
**** Systems with interactions[edit] ****
Idealized CurieâWeiss behavior; N.B. TC=Î¸, but TN is not Î¸. Paramagnetic
regimes are denoted by solid lines. Close to TN or TC the behavior usually
deviates from ideal.
As stated above, many materials that contain d- or f-elements do retain
unquenched spins. Salts of such elements often show paramagnetic behavior but
at low enough temperatures the magnetic moments may order. It is not uncommon
to call such materials 'paramagnets', when referring to their paramagnetic
behavior above their Curie or NÃ©el-points, particularly if such temperatures
are very low or have never been properly measured. Even for iron it is not
uncommon to say that iron becomes a paramagnet above its relatively high Curie-
point. In that case the Curie-point is seen as a phase_transition between a
ferromagnet and a 'paramagnet'. The word paramagnet now merely refers to the
linear response of the system to an applied field, the temperature dependence
of which requires an amended version of Curie's law, known as the CurieâWeiss
law:
          M  =   C  T &#x2212; &#x03B8;     H    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol
      {M}}={\frac {C}{T-\theta }}{\boldsymbol {H}}}  [{\boldsymbol  {M}}={\frac
      {C}{T-\theta }}{\boldsymbol  {H}}]
This amended law includes a term Î¸ that describes the exchange interaction
that is present albeit overcome by thermal motion. The sign of Î¸ depends on
whether ferro- or antiferromagnetic interactions dominate and it is seldom
exactly zero, except in the dilute, isolated cases mentioned above.
Obviously, the paramagnetic CurieâWeiss description above TN or TC is a
rather different interpretation of the word "paramagnet" as it does not imply
the absence of interactions, but rather that the magnetic_structure is random
in the absence of an external field at these sufficiently high temperatures.
Even if Î¸ is close to zero this does not mean that there are no interactions,
just that the aligning ferro- and the anti-aligning antiferromagnetic ones
cancel. An additional complication is that the interactions are often different
in different directions of the crystalline lattice (anisotropy), leading to
complicated magnetic_structures once ordered.
Randomness of the structure also applies to the many metals that show a net
paramagnetic response over a broad temperature range. They do not follow a
Curie type law as function of temperature however, often they are more or less
temperature independent. This type of behavior is of an itinerant nature and
better called Pauli-paramagnetism, but it is not unusual to see, for example,
the metal aluminium called a "paramagnet", even though interactions are strong
enough to give this element very good electrical conductivity.
**** Superparamagnets[edit] ****
Some materials show induced magnetic behavior that follows a Curie type law but
with exceptionally large values for the Curie constants. These materials are
known as superparamagnets. They are characterized by a strong ferromagnetic or
ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave
independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles
that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The
materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to
ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but
the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic
centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling
such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu2Se2 or the alloy AuFe. Such systems
contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower
temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.
