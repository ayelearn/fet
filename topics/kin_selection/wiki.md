The evolutionary strategy that favours the reproductive success of an
organism's relatives, even at a cost to the organism's own survival and
reproduction
The co-operative behaviour of social_insects like the honey bee can be
explained by kin selection.
Kin selection is the evolutionary strategy that favours the reproductive
success of an organism's relatives, even at a cost to the organism's own
survival and reproduction.[1] Kin altruism can look like altruistic_behaviour
whose evolution is driven by kin selection. Kin selection is an instance of
inclusive_fitness, which combines the number of offspring produced with the
number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others, such as
siblings.
Charles_Darwin discussed the concept of kin selection in his 1859 book, On_the
Origin_of_Species, where he reflected on the puzzle of sterile social insects,
such as honey_bees, which leave reproduction to their mothers, arguing that a
selection benefit to related organisms (the same "stock") would allow the
evolution of a trait that confers the benefit but destroys an individual at the
same time. R.A._Fisher in 1930 and J.B.S._Haldane in 1932 set out the
mathematics of kin selection, with Haldane famously joking that he would
willingly die for two brothers or eight cousins. In 1964, W.D._Hamilton
popularised the concept and the major advance in the mathematical treatment of
the phenomenon by George_R._Price which has become known as Hamilton's rule. In
the same year, John_Maynard_Smith used the actual term kin selection for the
first time.
According to Hamilton's rule, kin selection causes genes to increase in
frequency when the genetic relatedness of a recipient to an actor multiplied by
the benefit to the recipient is greater than the reproductive cost to the
actor.[2][3] Hamilton proposed two mechanisms for kin selection. First, kin
recognition allows individuals to be able to identify their relatives. Second,
in viscous populations, populations in which the movement of organisms from
their place of birth is relatively slow, local interactions tend to be among
relatives by default. The viscous population mechanism makes kin selection and
social cooperation possible in the absence of kin recognition. In this case,
nurture_kinship, the treatment of individuals as kin as a result of living
together, is sufficient for kin selection, given reasonable assumptions about
population dispersal rates. Note that kin selection is not the same thing as
group_selection, where natural_selection is believed to act on the group as a
whole.
In humans, altruism is both more likely and on a larger scale with kin than
with unrelated individuals; for example, humans give presents according to how
closely related they are to the recipient. In other species, vervet_monkeys use
allomothering, where related females such as older sisters or grandmothers
often care for young, according to their relatedness. The social shrimp
Synalpheus_regalis protects juveniles within highly related colonies.

***** Historical overview[edit] *****
Charles_Darwin was the first to discuss the concept of kin selection. In On the
Origin of Species, he wrote clearly about the conundrum represented by
altruistic sterile social_insects that
     This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I
     believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be
     applied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus
     gain the desired end. Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be
     well marbled together. An animal thus characterised has been
     slaughtered, but the breeder has gone with confidence to the same
     stock and has succeeded.
     â Darwin[4]
In this passage "the family" and "stock" stand for a kin group. These passages
and others by Darwin about "kin selection" are highlighted in D.J._Futuyma's
textbook of reference Evolutionary Biology[5] and in E._O._Wilson's
Sociobiology.[6]
The earliest mathematically formal treatments of kin selection were by R.A.
Fisher in 1930[7] and J.B.S._Haldane in 1932[8] and 1955.[9] J.B.S. Haldane
fully grasped the basic quantities and considerations in kin selection,
famously writing "I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins".
[10] Haldane's remark alluded to the fact that if an individual loses its life
to save two siblings, four nephews, or eight cousins, it is a "fair deal" in
evolutionary terms, as siblings are on average 50% identical by descent,
nephews 25%, and cousins 12.5% (in a diploid population that is randomly mating
and previously outbred). But Haldane also joked that he would truly die only to
save more than a single identical twin of his or more than two full siblings.
[11][12] In 1955 he clarified:
     Let us suppose that you carry a rare gene that affects your behaviour
     so that you jump into a flooded river and save a child, but you have
     one chance in ten of being drowned, while I do not possess the gene,
     and stand on the bank and watch the child drown. If the child's your
     own child or your brother or sister, there is an even chance that
     this child will also have this gene, so five genes will be saved in
     children for one lost in an adult. If you save a grandchild or a
     nephew, the advantage is only two and a half to one. If you only save
     a first cousin, the effect is very slight. If you try to save your
     first cousin once removed the population is more likely to lose this
     valuable gene than to gain it. â¦ It is clear that genes making for
     conduct of this kind would only have a chance of spreading in rather
     small populations when most of the children were fairly near
     relatives of the man who risked his life.[13]
W._D._Hamilton, in 1963[14] and especially in 1964[2][3] popularised the
concept and the more thorough mathematical treatment given to it by George
Price.[2][3]
John_Maynard_Smith may have coined the actual term "kin selection" in 1964:
     These processes I will call kin selection and group selection
     respectively. Kin selection has been discussed by Haldane and by
     Hamilton. â¦ By kin selection I mean the evolution of
     characteristics which favour the survival of close relatives of the
     affected individual, by processes which do not require any
     discontinuities in the population breeding structure.[15]
Kin selection causes changes in gene frequency across generations, driven by
interactions between related individuals. This dynamic forms the conceptual
basis of the theory of social_evolution. Some cases of evolution by natural
selection can only be understood by considering how biological relatives
influence each other's fitness. Under natural selection, a gene encoding a
trait that enhances the fitness of each individual carrying it should increase
in frequency within the population; and conversely, a gene that lowers the
individual fitness of its carriers should be eliminated. However, a
hypothetical gene that prompts behaviour which enhances the fitness of
relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the behaviour, may
nonetheless increase in frequency, because relatives often carry the same gene.
According to this principle, the enhanced fitness of relatives can at times
more than compensate for the fitness loss incurred by the individuals
displaying the behaviour, making kin selection possible. This is a special case
of a more general model, "inclusive_fitness".[16] This analysis has been
challenged,[17] Wilson writing that "the foundations of the general theory of
inclusive fitness based on the theory of kin selection have crumbled"[18] and
that he now relies instead on the theory of eusociality and "gene-culture co-
evolution" for the underlying mechanics of sociobiology.
"Kin selection" should not be confused with "group_selection" according to
which a genetic trait can become prevalent within a group because it benefits
the group as a whole, regardless of any benefit to individual organisms. All
known forms of group selection conform to the principle that an individual
behaviour can be evolutionarily successful only if the genes responsible for
this behaviour conform to Hamilton's Rule, and hence, on balance and in the
aggregate, benefit from the behaviour.[19][20][21]
***** Hamilton's rule[edit] *****
Further information: Biological_rules
Formally, genes should increase in frequency when
         r B > C   {\displaystyle rB>C}  [rB>C]
where
      r=the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the actor, often defined as
      the probability that a gene picked randomly from each at the same locus
      is identical by descent.
      B=the additional reproductive benefit gained by the recipient of the
      altruistic act,
      C=the reproductive cost to the individual performing the act.
This inequality is known as Hamilton's rule after W. D. Hamilton who in 1964
published the first formal quantitative treatment of kin selection.
The relatedness parameter (r) in Hamilton's rule was introduced in 1922 by
Sewall_Wright as a coefficient_of_relationship that gives the probability that
at a random locus, the alleles there will be identical_by_descent.[22]
Subsequent authors, including Hamilton, sometimes reformulate this with a
regression, which, unlike probabilities, can be negative. A regression analysis
producing statistically significant negative relationships indicates that two
individuals are less genetically alike than two random ones (Hamilton 1970,
Nature & Grafen 1985 Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology). This has been
invoked to explain the evolution of spiteful behaviour consisting of acts that
result in harm, or loss of fitness, to both the actor and the recipient.
Several scientific studies have found that the kin selection model can be
applied to nature. For example, in 2010 researchers used a wild population of
red_squirrels in Yukon, Canada to study kin selection in nature. The
researchers found that surrogate mothers would adopt related orphaned squirrel
pups but not unrelated orphans. The researchers calculated the cost of adoption
by measuring a decrease in the survival probability of the entire litter after
increasing the litter by one pup, while benefit was measured as the increased
chance of survival of the orphan. The degree of relatedness of the orphan and
surrogate mother for adoption to occur depended on the number of pups the
surrogate mother already had in her nest, as this affected the cost of
adoption. The study showed that females always adopted orphans when rB > C, but
never adopted when rB < C, providing strong support for Hamilton's rule.[23]
***** Mechanisms[edit] *****
Altruism occurs where the instigating individual suffers a fitness loss while
the receiving individual experiences a fitness gain. The sacrifice of one
individual to help another is an example.[24]
Hamilton (1964) outlined two ways in which kin selection altruism could be
favoured:
     The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the
     right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the
     relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious. It may
     be, for instance, that in respect of a certain social action
     performed towards neighbours indiscriminately, an individual is only
     just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn
     to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives
     and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to
     inclusive_fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such
     discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would
     be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any
     discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in
     the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations
     evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might
     occasion an advantage of a similar kind." (1996 [1964], 51)[2]
Kin_recognition: theory predicts that bearers of a trait (like the fictitious
'green_beard') will behave altruistically towards others with the same trait.
Kin recognition: First, if individuals have the capacity_to_recognise_kin and
to discriminate (positively) on the basis of kinship, then the average
relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough for kin
selection. Because of the facultative nature of this mechanism, kin recognition
and discrimination are expected to be unimportant except among 'higher' forms
of life such as the fish Neolamprologus_pulcher (although there is some
evidence for it among protozoa). Note also that kin recognition may be selected
for inbreeding avoidance, and little evidence indicates that 'innate' kin
recognition plays a role in mediating altruism. A thought experiment on the kin
recognition/discrimination distinction is the hypothetical 'green_beard', where
a gene for social behaviour is imagined also to cause a distinctive phenotype
that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene. Due to conflicting
genetic similarity in the rest of the genome, there would be selection pressure
for green-beard altruistic sacrifices to be suppressed, making common ancestry
the most likely form of inclusive fitness.
Viscous populations: Secondly, even indiscriminate altruism may be favoured in
"viscous" populations with low rates or short ranges of dispersal. Here, social
partners are typically genealogically close kin, and so altruism can flourish
even in the absence of kin recognition and kin discrimination
facultiesâspatial proximity and circumstantial cues serving as a rudimentary
form of discrimination. This suggests a rather general explanation for
altruism. Directional selection always favours those with higher rates of
fecundity within a certain population. Social individuals can often enhance the
survival of their own kin by participating in and following the rules of their
own group.
Hamilton later modified his thinking to suggest that an innate ability to
recognise actual genetic relatedness was unlikely to be the dominant mediating
mechanism for kin altruism:
     But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate
     kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than
     mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the
     trees. (Hamilton 1987, 425)[25]
Hamilton's later clarifications often go unnoticed, and because of the long-
standing assumption that kin selection requires innate powers of kin
recognition, some theorists have tried to clarify the position in recent work:
     In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory, Hamilton pointed
     out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours
     could accrue in two ways â kin discrimination or limited dispersal
     (Hamilton, 1964, 1971,1972, 1975). There is a huge theoretical
     literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by
     Platt & Bever (2009) and West et al. (2002a), as well as experimental
     evolution tests of these models (Diggle et al., 2007; Griffin et al.,
     2004; KÃ¼mmerli et al., 2009). However, despite this, it is still
     sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination
     (Oates & Wilson, 2001; Silk, 2002 ). Furthermore, a large number of
     authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin
     discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours
     can be directed towards relatives... [T]here is a huge industry of
     papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for
     cooperation. The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the
     incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits
     require kin discrimination (misconception 5), despite the fact that
     Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his
     earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964;
     Hamilton, 1971; Hamilton, 1972; Hamilton, 1975). (West et al. 2010,
     p.243 and supplement)[26]
The assumption that kin recognition must be innate, and that cue-based
mediation of social cooperation based on limited dispersal and shared
developmental context are not sufficient, has obscured significant progress
made in applying kin selection and inclusive fitness theory to a wide variety
of species, including humans,[27][28] on the basis of cue-based mediation of
social_bonding_and_social_behaviours.
***** Kin selection and human social patterns[edit] *****
Families are important in human behaviour, but kin selection may be based on
closeness and other cues.
See also: Human_inclusive_fitness and Nurture_kinship
Evolutionary_psychologists, following early_human_sociobiologists'
interpretation[29] of kin selection theory initially attempted to explain human
altruistic behaviour through kin selection by stating that "behaviors that help
a genetic relative are favored by natural selection." However, most
Evolutionary psychologists recognise that this common shorthand formulation is
inaccurate;
     [M]any misunderstandings persist. In many cases, they result from
     conflating "coefficient of relatedness" and "proportion of shared
     genes," which is a short step from the intuitively appealingâbut
     incorrectâinterpretation that "animals tend to be altruistic toward
     those with whom they share a lot of genes." These misunderstandings
     donât just crop up occasionally; they are repeated in many
     writings, including undergraduate psychology textbooksâmost of them
     in the field of social psychology, within sections describing
     evolutionary approaches to altruism. (Park 2007, p860)[30]
As with the earlier sociobiological forays into the cross-cultural data,
typical approaches are not able to find explanatory fit with the findings of
ethnographers insofar that human kinship patterns are not necessarily built
upon blood-ties. However, as Hamilton's later refinements of his theory make
clear, it does not simply predict that genetically related individuals will
inevitably recognise and engage in positive social behaviours with genetic
relatives: rather, indirect context-based mechanisms may have evolved, which in
historical environments have met the inclusive fitness criterion (see above
section). Consideration of the demographics of the typical evolutionary
environment of any species is crucial to understanding the evolution of social
behaviours. As Hamilton himself puts it, "Altruistic or selfish acts are only
possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours
are conditional from the start." (Hamilton 1987, 420).[25]
Under this perspective, and noting the necessity of a reliable context of
interaction being available, the data on how altruism is mediated in social
mammals is readily made sense of. In social mammals, primates and humans,
altruistic acts that meet the kin selection criterion are typically mediated by
circumstantial cues such as shared developmental environment, familiarity and
social bonding.[31] That is, it is the context that mediates the development of
the bonding process and the expression of the altruistic behaviours, not
genetic relatedness per se. This interpretation thus is compatible with the
cross-cultural ethnographic data[28] and has been called nurture_kinship.
***** Examples[edit] *****
Eusociality (true sociality) is used to describe social systems with three
characteristics: an overlap in generations between parents and their offspring,
cooperative brood care, and specialised castes of non-reproductive individuals.
[32] The social insects provide good examples of organisms with what appear to
be kin selected traits. The workers of some species are sterile, a trait that
would not occur if individual selection was the only process at work. The
relatedness coefficient r is abnormally high between the worker sisters in a
colony of Hymenoptera due to haplodiploidy. Hamilton's rule is presumed to be
satisfied because the benefits in fitness for the workers are believed to
exceed the costs in terms of lost reproductive opportunity, though this has
never been demonstrated empirically. There are competing hypotheses, as well,
which may also explain the evolution of social behaviour in such organisms.[17]
Sun-tailed_monkeys favour their own maternal kin.
In sun-tailed_monkey communities, maternal kin (kin related to by mothers)
favour each other, but that with relatives more distant than half-siblings,
this bias drops significantly.[33]
Alarm calls in ground squirrels appear to confirm kin selection. While calls
may alert others of the same species to danger, they draw attention to the
caller and expose it to increased risk of predation. The calls occur most
frequently when the caller had relatives nearby.[34] Individual male prairie
dogs followed through different stages of life modify their rate of calling
when closer to kin. These behaviours show that self-sacrifice is directed
towards close relatives, and that there is an indirect fitness gain.[32]
Surrogate mothers adopt orphaned red squirrels in the wild only when the
conditions of Hamilton's rule were met.[23]
Alan Krakauer of University_of_California,_Berkeley has studied kin selection
in the courtship behaviour of wild turkeys. Like a teenager helping her older
sister prepare for a party, a subordinate turkey may help his dominant brother
put on an impressive team display that is only of direct benefit to the
dominant member.[35]
Even certain plants can recognise and respond to kinship ties. Using sea
rocket, Susan Dudley at McMaster_University, Canada compared the growth
patterns of unrelated plants sharing a pot to plants from the same clone. She
found that unrelated plants competed for soil nutrients by aggressive root
growth. This did not occur with sibling plants.[36]
In the wood_mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), aggregates of spermatozoa form mobile
trains, some of the spermatozoa undergo premature acrosome reactions that
correlate to improved mobility of the mobile trains towards the female egg for
fertilisation. This association is thought to proceed as a result of a "green
beard effect" in which the spermatozoa perform a kin-selective altruistic act
after identifying genetic similarity with the surrounding spermatozoa.[37]
***** In humans[edit] *****
Main article: Human_inclusive_fitness
Whether or not Hamilton's_rule always applies, relatedness is often important
for human altruism, in that humans are inclined to behave more altruistically
toward kin than toward unrelated individuals.[38] Many people choose to live
near relatives, exchange sizeable gifts with relatives, and favour relatives in
wills in proportion to their relatedness.[38]
**** Experimental studies, interviews, and surveys[edit] ****
Interviews of several hundred women in Los Angeles showed that while non-kin
friends were willing to help one another, their assistance was far more likely
to be reciprocal. The largest amounts of non-reciprocal help, however, were
reportedly provided by kin. Additionally, more closely related kin were
considered more likely sources of assistance than distant kin.[39] Similarly,
several surveys of American college students found that individuals were more
likely to incur the cost of assisting kin when a high probability that
relatedness and benefit would be greater than cost existed. Participantsâ
feelings of helpfulness were stronger toward family members than non-kin.
Additionally, participants were found to be most willing to help those
individuals most closely related to them. Interpersonal relationships between
kin in general were more supportive and less Machiavellian than those between
non-kin.[40]
In one experiment, the longer participants (from both the UK and the South
African Zulus) held a painful skiing position, the more money or food was
presented to a given relative. Participants repeated the experiment for
individuals of different relatedness (parents and siblings at r=.5,
grandparents, nieces, and nephews at r=.25, etc.). The results showed that
participants held the position for longer intervals the greater the degree of
relatedness between themselves and those receiving the reward.[41]
**** Observational studies[edit] ****
A study of food-sharing practices on the West Caroline islets of Ifaluk
determined that food-sharing was more common among people from the same islet,
possibly because the degree of relatedness between inhabitants of the same
islet would be higher than relatedness between inhabitants of different islets.
When food was shared between islets, the distance the sharer was required to
travel correlated with the relatedness of the recipientâa greater distance
meant that the recipient needed to be a closer relative. The relatedness of the
individual and the potential inclusive fitness benefit needed to outweigh the
energy cost of transporting the food over distance.[42]
Humans may use the inheritance of material goods and wealth to maximise their
inclusive fitness. By providing close kin with inherited wealth, an individual
may improve his or her kinâs reproductive opportunities and thus increase his
or her own inclusive fitness even after death. A study of a thousand wills
found that the beneficiaries who received the most inheritance were generally
those most closely related to the willâs writer. Distant kin received
proportionally less inheritance, with the least amount of inheritance going to
non-kin.[43]
A study of childcare practices among Canadian women found that respondents with
children provide childcare reciprocally with non-kin. The cost of caring for
non-kin was balanced by the benefit a woman receivedâhaving her own offspring
cared for in return. However, respondents without children were significantly
more likely to offer childcare to kin. For individuals without their own
offspring, the inclusive fitness benefits of providing care to closely related
children might outweigh the time and energy costs of childcare.[44]
Family investment in offspring among black South African households also
appears consistent with an inclusive fitness model.[45] A higher degree of
relatedness between children and their caregivers frequently correlated with a
higher degree of investment in the children, with more food, health care, and
clothing being provided. Relatedness between the child and the rest of the
household also positively associated with the regularity of a childâs visits
to local medical practitioners and with the highest grade the child had
completed in school. Additionally, relatedness negatively associated with a
childâs being behind in school for his or her age.
Observation of the Dolgan hunter-gatherers of northern Russia suggested that,
while reciprocal food-sharing occurs between both kin and non-kin, there are
larger and more frequent asymmetrical transfers of food to kin. Kin are also
more likely to be welcomed to non-reciprocal meals, while non-kin are
discouraged from attending. Finally, even when reciprocal food-sharing occurs
between families, these families are often very closely related, and the
primary beneficiaries are the offspring.[46]
Other research indicates that violence in families is more likely to occur when
step-parents are present and that "genetic relationship is associated with a
softening of conflict, and people's evident valuations of themselves and of
others are systematically related to the parties' reproductive values".[47]
Numerous other studies suggest how inclusive fitness may work amongst different
peoples, such as the Yeâkwana of southern Venezuela, the Gypsies of Hungary,
and the doomed Donner Party of the United States.[48][49][50][51][52]
***** In non-human species[edit] *****
Vervet_monkeys display kin selection between siblings, mothers and offspring,
and grandparent-grandchild. These monkeys utilise allomothering, where the
allomother is typically an older female sibling or a grandmother. Other studies
have shown that individuals will act aggressively toward other individuals that
were aggressive toward their relatives.[53][54]
Synalpheus_regalis is a eusocial shrimp that protects juveniles in the colony.
By defending the young, the large defender shrimp can increase its inclusive
fitness. Allozyme data revealed that relatedness within colonies is high,
averaging 0.50, indicating that colonies in this species represent close kin
groups.[55]

***** Objections[edit] *****
The theory of kin selection has been criticised by Alonso in 1998[56] and by
Alonso and Schuck-Paim in 2002.[57] Alonso and Schuck-Paim argue that the
behaviours which kin selection attempts to explain are not altruistic (in pure
Darwinian terms) because: (1) they may directly favour the performer as an
individual aiming to maximise its progeny (so the behaviours can be explained
as ordinary individual selection); (2) these behaviours benefit the group (so
they can be explained as group selection); or (3) they are by-products of a
developmental system of many "individuals" performing different tasks (like a
colony of bees, or the cells of multicellular organisms, which are the focus of
selection). They also argue that the genes involved in sex ratio conflicts
could be treated as "parasites" of (already established) social colonies, not
as their "promoters", and, therefore the sex ratio in colonies would be
irrelevant to the transition to eusociality.[56][57] Those ideas were mostly
ignored until they were put forward again in a series of papers by E._O.
Wilson, Bert_HÃ¶lldobler, Martin_Nowak and others.[58][59][60] Nowak, Tarnita
and Wilson argued that
     Inclusive fitness theory is not a simplification over the standard
     approach. It is an alternative accounting method, but one that works
     only in a very limited domain. Whenever inclusive fitness does work,
     the results are identical to those of the standard approach.
     Inclusive fitness theory is an unnecessary detour, which does not
     provide additional insight or information.
     â Nowak, Tarnita, and Wilson[17]
They, like Alonso (1998) and Alonso and Schuck-Paim (2002) earlier, argue for a
multi-level_selection model instead.[17] This aroused a strong response,
including a rebuttal published in Nature from over a hundred researchers.[61]
