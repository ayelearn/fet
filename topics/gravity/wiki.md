Gravity (from Latin gravitas, meaning 'weight'[1]), or gravitation, is a
natural_phenomenon by which all things with mass or energyâincluding planets,
stars, galaxies, and even light[2]âare brought toward (or gravitate toward)
one another. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical_objects, and the Moon's
gravity causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original
gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming
starsâand for the stars to group together into galaxiesâso gravity is
responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has
an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther
objects.
Gravity is most accurately described by the general_theory_of_relativity
(proposed by Albert_Einstein in 1915) which describes gravity not as a force,
but as a consequence of the curvature_of_spacetime caused by the uneven
distribution of mass. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime
is a black_hole, from which nothingânot even lightâcan escape once past the
black hole's event_horizon.[3] However, for most applications, gravity is well
approximated by Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation, which describes gravity
as a force which causes any two bodies to be attracted to each other, with the
force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely_proportional to
the square of the distance between them.
Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental_interactions of physics,
approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong_interaction, 1036 times weaker
than the electromagnetic_force and 1029 times weaker than the weak_interaction.
As a consequence, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic
particles.[4] In contrast, it is the dominant interaction at the macroscopic
scale, and is the cause of the formation, shape and trajectory (orbit) of
astronomical_bodies. For example, gravity causes the Earth and the other
planets to orbit the Sun, it also causes the Moon to orbit the Earth, and
causes the formation of tides, the formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System,
stars and galaxies.
The earliest instance of gravity in the Universe, possibly in the form of
quantum_gravity, supergravity or a gravitational_singularity, along with
ordinary space and time, developed during the Planck_epoch (up to 10â43
seconds after the birth of the Universe), possibly from a primeval state, such
as a false_vacuum, quantum_vacuum or virtual_particle, in a currently unknown
manner.[5] Attempts to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum
mechanics, a quantum_gravity theory, which would allow gravity to be united in
a common mathematical framework (a theory_of_everything) with the other three
fundamental interactions of physics, are a current area of research.

***** History of gravitational theory *****
Main article: History_of_gravitational_theory
**** Greco-Roman world ****
Archimedes discovered the center_of_gravity of a triangle.[6] He also
postulated that if the centers of gravity of two equal weights wasn't the same,
it would be located in the middle of the line that joins them.[7]
The Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius in De_Architectura postulated that
gravity of an object didn't depend on weight but its "nature".[8]
**** Ancient India ****
Main article: List_of_Indian_inventions_and_discoveries_Â§ Sciences
Aryabhata first identified the force to explain why objects are not thrown out
when the earth rotates. Brahmagupta described gravity as an attractive force
and used the term "gruhtvaakarshan" for gravity.[9][10]
**** Scientific revolution ****
Main article: Scientific_revolution
Modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of Galileo_Galilei in
the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In his famous (though possibly
apocryphal[11]) experiment dropping balls from the Tower_of_Pisa, and later
with careful measurements of balls rolling down inclines, Galileo showed that
gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects. This was a major
departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have a higher
gravitational acceleration.[12] Galileo postulated air_resistance as the reason
that objects with less mass fall more slowly in an atmosphere. Galileo's work
set the stage for the formulation of Newton's theory of gravity.[13]
**** Newton's theory of gravitation ****
Main article: Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation
English physicist and mathematician, Sir_Isaac_Newton (1642â1727)
In 1687, English mathematician Sir Isaac_Newton published Principia, which
hypothesizes the inverse-square_law of universal gravitation. In his own words,
"I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [be]
reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which
they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her
Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them
answer pretty nearly."[14] The equation is the following:
   F = G     m  1    m  2     r  2     &#xA0;   {\displaystyle F=G{\frac {m_
{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}\ }  [F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}\ ]
Where F is the force, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects interacting, r is
the distance between the centers of the masses and G is the gravitational
constant.
Newton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the
existence of Neptune based on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted for
by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by both John_Couch_Adams and
Urbain_Le_Verrier predicted the general position of the planet, and Le
Verrier's calculations are what led Johann_Gottfried_Galle to the discovery of
Neptune.
A discrepancy in Mercury's orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By the
end of the 19th century, it was known that its orbit showed slight
perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under Newton's theory,
but all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun
even closer than Mercury) had been fruitless. The issue was resolved in 1915 by
Albert_Einstein's new theory of general_relativity, which accounted for the
small discrepancy in Mercury's orbit. This discrepancy was the advance in the
perihelion of Mercury of 42.98 arcseconds per century.[15]
Although Newton's theory has been superseded by Einstein's general relativity,
most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations are still made using
Newton's theory because it is simpler to work with and it gives sufficiently
accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses,
speeds and energies.
**** Equivalence principle ****
The equivalence_principle, explored by a succession of researchers including
Galileo, LorÃ¡nd_EÃ¶tvÃ¶s, and Einstein, expresses the idea that all objects
fall in the same way, and that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable
from certain aspects of acceleration and deceleration. The simplest way to test
the weak equivalence principle is to drop two objects of different masses or
compositions in a vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time.
Such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other
forces (such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects) are negligible.
More sophisticated tests use a torsion balance of a type invented by EÃ¶tvÃ¶s.
Satellite experiments, for example STEP, are planned for more accurate
experiments in space.[16]
Formulations of the equivalence principle include:
    * The weak equivalence principle: The trajectory of a point mass in a
      gravitational_field depends only on its initial position and velocity,
      and is independent of its composition.[17]
    * The Einsteinian equivalence principle: The outcome of any local non-
      gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of
      the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.[18]
    * The strong equivalence principle requiring both of the above.
**** General relativity ****
See also: Introduction_to_general_relativity
Two-dimensional analogy of spacetime distortion generated by the mass of an
object. Matter changes the geometry of spacetime, this (curved) geometry being
interpreted as gravity. White lines do not represent the curvature of space but
instead represent the coordinate_system imposed on the curved spacetime, which
would be rectilinear in a flat spacetime.

In general_relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime
curvature instead of a force. The starting point for general relativity is the
equivalence_principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion and
describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to non-
inertial observers on the ground.[19][20] In Newtonian_physics, however, no
such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being
operated on by a force.
Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling
objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These
straight paths are called geodesics. Like Newton's first law of motion,
Einstein's theory states that if a force is applied on an object, it would
deviate from a geodesic. For instance, we are no longer following geodesics
while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward
force on us, and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result. This explains
why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.
Einstein discovered the field_equations of general relativity, which relate the
presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after him. The
Einstein_field_equations are a set of 10 simultaneous, non-linear, differential
equations. The solutions of the field equations are the components of the
metric_tensor of spacetime. A metric tensor describes a geometry of spacetime.
The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.
*** Solutions ***
Notable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:
    * The Schwarzschild_solution, which describes spacetime surrounding a
      spherically_symmetric non-rotating uncharged massive object. For compact
      enough objects, this solution generated a black_hole with a central
      singularity. For radial distances from the center which are much greater
      than the Schwarzschild_radius, the accelerations predicted by the
      Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by
      Newton's theory of gravity.
    * The Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m_solution, in which the central object has an
      electrical charge. For charges with a geometrized length which are less
      than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution
      produces black holes with double event_horizons.
    * The Kerr_solution for rotating massive objects. This solution also
      produces black holes with multiple event horizons.
    * The Kerr-Newman_solution for charged, rotating massive objects. This
      solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.
    * The cosmological Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker_solution, which
      predicts the expansion of the Universe.
*** Tests ***
The tests_of_general_relativity included the following:[21]
    * General relativity accounts for the anomalous perihelion_precession_of
      Mercury.[22]
    * The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials (gravitational
      time_dilation) has been confirmed by the PoundâRebka_experiment (1959),
      the HafeleâKeating_experiment, and the GPS.
    * The prediction of the deflection of light was first confirmed by Arthur
      Stanley_Eddington from his observations during the Solar_eclipse_of_29
      May_1919.[23][24] Eddington measured starlight deflections twice those
      predicted by Newtonian corpuscular theory, in accordance with the
      predictions of general relativity. However, his interpretation of the
      results was later disputed.[25] More recent tests using radio
      interferometric measurements of quasars passing behind the Sun have more
      accurately and consistently confirmed the deflection of light to the
      degree predicted by general relativity.[26] See also gravitational_lens.
    * The time_delay_of_light passing close to a massive object was first
      identified by Irwin_I._Shapiro in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft
      signals.
    * Gravitational_radiation has been indirectly confirmed through studies of
      binary pulsars. On 11 February 2016, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations
      announced the first observation of a gravitational wave.
    * Alexander_Friedmann in 1922 found that Einstein equations have non-
      stationary solutions (even in the presence of the cosmological_constant).
      In 1927 Georges_LemaÃ®tre showed that static solutions of the Einstein
      equations, which are possible in the presence of the cosmological
      constant, are unstable, and therefore the static Universe envisioned by
      Einstein could not exist. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with
      the results of Friedmann and LemaÃ®tre. Thus general relativity predicted
      that the Universe had to be non-staticâit had to either expand or
      contract. The expansion of the Universe discovered by Edwin_Hubble in
      1929 confirmed this prediction.[27]
    * The theory's prediction of frame_dragging was consistent with the recent
      Gravity_Probe_B results.[28]
    * General relativity predicts that light should lose its_energy when
      traveling away from massive bodies through gravitational_redshift. This
      was verified on earth and in the solar system around 1960.
**** Gravity and quantum mechanics ****
Main articles: Graviton and Quantum_gravity
In the decades after the publication of the theory of general relativity, it
was realized that general relativity is incompatible with quantum_mechanics.
[29] It is possible to describe gravity in the framework of quantum_field
theory like the other fundamental_interactions, such that the âattractive
forceâ of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, in the same
way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons.[30]
[31] This reproduces general relativity in the classical_limit. However, this
approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck_length,[29] where
a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum
mechanics) is required.
***** Specifics *****
**** Earth's gravity ****
An initially-stationary object that is allowed to fall freely under gravity
drops a distance that is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. This
image spans half a second and was captured at 20 flashes per second.
Main article: Earth's_gravity
Every planetary body (including the Earth) is surrounded by its own
gravitational field, which can be conceptualized with Newtonian physics as
exerting an attractive force on all objects. Assuming a spherically symmetrical
planet, the strength of this field at any given point above the surface is
proportional to the planetary body's mass and inversely proportional to the
square of the distance from the center of the body.
If an object with comparable mass to that of the Earth were to fall towards it,
then the corresponding acceleration of the Earth would be observable.
The strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the
acceleration of objects under its influence.[32] The rate of acceleration of
falling objects near the Earth's surface varies very slightly depending on
latitude, surface features such as mountains and ridges, and perhaps unusually
high or low sub-surface densities.[33] For purposes of weights and measures, a
standard_gravity value is defined by the International_Bureau_of_Weights_and
Measures, under the International_System_of_Units (SI).
That value, denoted g, is g = 9.80665 m/s2 (32.1740 ft/s2).[34][35]
The standard value of 9.80665 m/s2 is the one originally adopted by the
International Committee on Weights and Measures in 1901 for 45Â° latitude, even
though it has been shown to be too high by about five parts in ten thousand.
[36] This value has persisted in meteorology and in some standard atmospheres
as the value for 45Â° latitude even though it applies more precisely to
latitude of 45Â°32'33".[37]
Assuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance, this means
that an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its velocity
by 9.80665 m/s (32.1740 ft/s or 22 mph) for each second of its descent. Thus,
an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665 m/s (32.1740 ft/
s) after one second, approximately 19.62 m/s (64.4 ft/s) after two seconds, and
so on, adding 9.80665 m/s (32.1740 ft/s) to each resulting velocity. Also,
again ignoring air resistance, any and all objects, when dropped from the same
height, will hit the ground at the same time.
According to Newton's_3rd_Law, the Earth itself experiences a force equal in
magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling
object. This means that the Earth also accelerates towards the object until
they collide. Because the mass of the Earth is huge, however, the acceleration
imparted to the Earth by this opposite force is negligible in comparison to the
object's. If the object does not bounce after it has collided with the Earth,
each of them then exerts a repulsive contact_force on the other which
effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and prevents further
acceleration.
The force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:[38]
(a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of
gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an
earthbound, rotating frame of reference. The force of gravity is the weakest at
the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation and
because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the Earth. The
force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780 m/s2 at
the Equator to about 9.832 m/s2 at the poles.
**** Equations for a falling body near the surface of the Earth ****
Main article: Equations_for_a_falling_body
Under an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, Newton's_law_of
universal_gravitation simplifies to F = mg, where m is the mass of the body and
g is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81 m/s2 on Earth. This
resulting force is the object's weight. The acceleration due to gravity is
equal to this g. An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely
under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the
elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second, was captured with
a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second. During the first &#x200b;1⁄20 of
a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is about 12 mm); by
&#x200b;2⁄20 it has dropped at total of 4 units; by &#x200b;3⁄20, 9 units and
so on.
Under the same constant gravity assumptions, the potential_energy, Ep, of a
body at height h is given by Ep = mgh (or Ep = Wh, with W meaning weight). This
expression is valid only over small distances h from the surface of the Earth.
Similarly, the expression     h =     v  2    2 g       {\displaystyle h=
{\tfrac {v^{2}}{2g}}}  [h={\tfrac {v^{2}}{2g}}] for the maximum height reached
by a vertically projected body with initial velocity v is useful for small

Gravity acts on stars that form the Milky_Way.[39]
The application of Newton's law of gravity has enabled the acquisition of much
of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the
mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark_matter is
inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all
the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by
applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In
space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon
it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit galactic_centers, galaxies orbit a center
of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity
exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of
those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between them.
The earliest gravity (possibly in the form of quantum gravity, supergravity or
a gravitational_singularity), along with ordinary space and time, developed
during the Planck_epoch (up to 10â43 seconds after the birth of the
Universe), possibly from a primeval state (such as a false_vacuum, quantum
vacuum or virtual_particle), in a currently unknown manner.[5]
**** Gravitational radiation ****
[LIGO_Hanford_Observatory]
The LIGO Hanford Observatory located in Washington, US where gravitational
waves were first observed in September 2015.
Main article: Gravitational_wave
According to general relativity, gravitational radiation is generated in
situations where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such as with co-
orbiting objects. As of 2019[update], the gravitational radiation emitted by
the Solar_System is far too small to measure; however, on 14 September 2015,
LIGO registered gravitational waves (gravitational radiation) for the first
time as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years
from Earth.[40][41] This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of
Einstein and others that such waves exist. It also opens the way for practical
observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the
Universe including the Big Bang.[42] It is believed that neutron_star mergers
and black_hole formation may also create detectable amounts of gravitational
radiation.[citation_needed] Prior to LIGO, gravitational radiation had been
indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such
as PSR_B1913+16.
**** Speed of gravity ****
Main article: Speed_of_gravity
In December 2012, a research team in China announced that it had produced
measurements of the phase lag of Earth_tides during full and new moons which
seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light.[43]
This means that if the Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would keep orbiting
it normally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to travel that
distance. The team's findings were released in the Chinese_Science_Bulletin in
February 2013.[44]
In October 2017, the LIGO and Virgo detectors received gravitational wave
signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing
signals from the same direction. This confirmed that the speed of gravitational
waves was the same as the speed of light.[45]
***** Anomalies and discrepancies *****
There are some observations that are not adequately accounted for, which may
point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in
other ways.
Rotation curve of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted (A) and observed (B). The
discrepancy between the curves is attributed to dark_matter.
    * Extra-fast stars: Stars in galaxies follow a distribution_of_velocities
      where stars on the outskirts are moving faster than they should according
      to the observed distributions of normal matter. Galaxies within galaxy
      clusters show a similar pattern. Dark_matter, which would interact
      through gravitation but not electromagnetically, would account for the
      discrepancy. Various modifications_to_Newtonian_dynamics have also been
      proposed.
    * Flyby_anomaly: Various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration
      than expected during gravity_assist maneuvers.
    * Accelerating expansion: The metric_expansion_of_space seems to be
      speeding up. Dark_energy has been proposed to explain this. A recent
      alternative explanation is that the geometry of space is not homogeneous
      (due to clusters of galaxies) and that when the data are reinterpreted to
      take this into account, the expansion is not speeding up after all,[46]
      however this conclusion is disputed.[47]
    * Anomalous increase of the astronomical_unit: Recent measurements indicate
      that planetary_orbits_are_widening faster than if this were solely
      through the Sun losing mass by radiating energy.
    * Extra energetic photons: Photons travelling through galaxy clusters
      should gain energy and then lose it again on the way out. The
      accelerating expansion of the Universe should stop the photons returning
      all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from the cosmic
      microwave_background_radiation gain twice as much energy as expected.
      This may indicate that gravity falls off faster than inverse-squared at
      certain distance scales.[48]
    * Extra massive hydrogen clouds: The spectral lines of the Lyman-alpha
      forest suggest that hydrogen clouds are more clumped together at certain
      scales than expected and, like dark_flow, may indicate that gravity falls
      off slower than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.[48]
