Centrifugal compressors, sometimes called radial compressors, are a sub-class
of dynamic axisymmetric work-absorbing turbomachinery.[1]
They achieve a pressure rise by adding kinetic_energy/velocity to a continuous
flow of fluid through the rotor or impeller. This kinetic energy is then
converted to an increase in potential_energy/static pressure by slowing the
flow through a diffuser. The pressure rise in the impeller is in most cases
almost equal to the rise in the diffuser.

***** Theory of operation[edit] *****
In the case where flow passes through a straight pipe to enter a centrifugal
compressor the flow is straight, uniform and has no vorticity, ie swirling
motion, so the swirl angle Î±1 = 0Â° as illustrated. As the flow passes through
the centrifugal impeller, the impeller forces the flow to spin faster as it
gets further from the rotational axis. According to a form of Euler's fluid
dynamics equation, known as the pump_and_turbine_equation, the energy input to
the fluid is proportional to the flow's local spinning velocity multiplied by
the local impeller tangential_velocity.
In many cases, the flow leaving the centrifugal impeller is travelling near the
speed_of_sound. It then flows through a stationary compressor causing it to
decelerate. The stationary compressor is ducting with increasing flow-area
where energy transformation takes place. If the flow has to be turned in a
rearward direction to enter the next part of the machine, eg another impeller
or a combustor, flow losses can be reduced by directing the flow with
stationary turning vanes or individual turning pipes (pipe diffusers). As
described in Bernoulli's_principle, the reduction in velocity causes the
pressure to rise.[1]
***** Historical contributions, the pioneers[edit] *****
Over the past 100 years, applied scientists including Stodola (1903,
1927â1945),[2] Pfleiderer (1952),[3] Hawthorne (1964),[4] Shepard (1956),[1]
Lakshminarayana (1996),[5] and Japikse (many texts including citations),[6][7]
[8][9] have educated young engineers in the fundamentals of turbomachinery.
These understandings apply to all dynamic, continuous-flow, axisymmetric pumps,
fans, blowers, and compressors in axial, mixed-flow and radial/centrifugal
configurations.
This relationship is the reason advances in turbines and axial compressors
often find their way into other turbomachinery including centrifugal
compressors. Figures 1.1 and 1.2[10][11] illustrate the domain of
turbomachinery with labels showing centrifugal compressors. Improvements in
centrifugal compressors have not been achieved through large discoveries.
Rather, improvements have been achieved through understanding and applying
incremental pieces of knowledge discovered by many individuals.
Figure 1.1 represents the aero-thermo domain of turbomachinery. The horizontal
axis represents the energy equation derivable from The first_law_of
thermodynamics.[1][11] The vertical axis, which can be characterized by Mach
Number, represents the range of fluid compressibility (or elasticity).[1][11]
The Z-axis, which can be characterized by Reynolds_number, represents the range
of fluid viscosities (or stickiness).[1][11] Mathematicians and physicists who
established the foundations of this aero-thermo domain include:[12][13] Isaac
Newton, Daniel_Bernoulli, Leonhard_Euler, Claude-Louis_Navier, George_Stokes,
Ernst_Mach, Nikolay_Yegorovich_Zhukovsky, Martin_Kutta, Ludwig_Prandtl,
Theodore_von_KÃ¡rmÃ¡n, Paul_Richard_Heinrich_Blasius, and Henri_CoandÄ.
Figure 1.2 represents the physical or mechanical domain of turbomachinery.
Again, the horizontal axis represents the energy equation with turbines
generating power to the left and compressors absorbing power to the right.[1]
[11] Within the physical domain the vertical axis differentiates between high
speeds and low speeds depending upon the turbomachinery application.[1][11] The
Z-axis differentiates between axial-flow geometry and radial-flow geometry
within the physical domain of turbomachinery.[1][11] It is implied that mixed-
flow turbomachinery lie between axial and radial.[1][11] Key contributors of
technical achievements that pushed the practical application of turbomachinery
forward include:[12][13] Denis_Papin,[14] Kernelien Le Demour, Daniel_Gabriel
Fahrenheit, John Smeaton, Dr. A. C. E. Rateau,[15] John_Barber, Alexander
Sablukov, Sir Charles_Algernon_Parsons, Ãgidius_Elling, Sanford_Alexander

***** Turbomachinery similarities[edit] *****
Centrifugal compressors are similar in many ways to other turbomachinery and
are compared and contrasted as follows:
**** Similarities to axial compressor[edit] ****
Cutaway showing an axi-centrifugal compressor gas turbine
Centrifugal compressors are similar to axial_compressors in that they are
rotating airfoil-based compressors. Both are shown in the adjacent photograph
of an engine with 5 stages of axial compressor and one stage of centrifugal
compressor.[5][7] The first part of the centrifugal impeller looks very similar
to an axial compressor. This first part of the centrifugal impeller is also
termed an inducer. Centrifugal compressors differ from axials as they use a
significant change in radius from inlet to exit of the impeller to produce a
much greater pressure rise in a single stage (eg 8[16] in the Pratt_&_Whitney
Canada_PW200 series of helicopter engines) than does an axial stage. The 1940s-
era German Heinkel_HeS_011 experimental engine was the first aviation turbojet
to have a compressor stage with radial flow-turning part-way between none for
an axial and 90 degrees for a centrifugal. It is known as a mixed/diagonal-flow
compressor. A diagonal stage is used in the Pratt_&_Whitney_Canada_PW600 series
of small turbofans.
**** Centrifugal fan[edit] ****
A low speed, low pressure centrifugal compressor or centrifugal_fan, with
upward discharging cone used to diffuse the air velocity
A squirrel-cage_fan, without a discharge diffuser
Centrifugal compressors are also similar to centrifugal_fans of the style shown
in neighboring figure as they both increase the flows energy through increasing
radius.[1] In contrast to centrifugal fans, compressors operate at higher
speeds to generate greater pressure rises. In many cases the engineering
methods used to design a centrifugal fan are the same as those to design a
centrifugal compressor, so they can look very similar.
This relationship is less true in comparison to the squirrel-cage_fan shown in
the accompanying figure.
For purposes of generalization and definition, it can be said that centrifugal
compressors often have density increases greater than 5 percent. Also, they
often experience relative fluid velocities above Mach_number 0.3[5][17] when
the working fluid is air or nitrogen. In contrast, fans or blowers are often
considered to have density increases of less than five percent and peak
relative fluid velocities below Mach 0.3.
**** Centrifugal pump[edit] ****
A 3D-solids model of a type of centrifugal_pump
Cut-away of a centrifugal_pump
Centrifugal compressors are also similar to centrifugal_pumps[1] of the style
shown in the adjacent figures. The key difference between such compressors and
pumps is that the compressor working fluid is a gas (compressible) and the pump
working fluid is liquid (incompressible). Again, the engineering methods used
to design a centrifugal pump are the same as those to design a centrifugal
compressor. Yet, there is one important difference: the need to deal with
cavitation in pumps.
**** Radial turbine[edit] ****
Centrifugal compressors also look very similar to their turbomachinery
counterpart the radial_turbine as shown in the figure. While a compressor
transfers energy into a flow to raise its pressure, a turbine operates in
reverse, by extracting energy from a flow, thus reducing its pressure.[7] In
other words, power is input to compressors and output from turbines.
**** Turbomachinery using centrifugal compressors[edit] ****
A partial list of turbomachinery that may use one or more centrifugal
compressors within the machine are listed here.
    * Auxiliary_power_unit
    * Centrifugal-type_supercharger
    * Gas_turbine
    * Turbocharger
    * Turboprop
    * Turboshaft
***** Components of a simple centrifugal compressor[edit] *****
A simple centrifugal compressor has four components: inlet, impeller/rotor,
diffuser, and collector.[1] Figure 3.1 shows each of the components of the flow
path, with the flow (working gas) entering the centrifugal impeller axially
from right to left. As a result of the impeller rotating clockwise when looking
downstream into the compressor, the flow will pass through the volute's
discharge cone moving away from the figure's viewer.
Figure 3.1 â Cut-away view of a turbocharger showing the centrifugal
compressor (blue) on the right end of the rotor
**** Inlet[edit] ****
The inlet to a centrifugal compressor is typically a simple pipe. It may
include features such as a valve, stationary vanes/airfoils (used to help swirl
the flow) and both pressure and temperature instrumentation. All of these
additional devices have important uses in the control of the centrifugal
compressor.
**** Centrifugal impeller[edit] ****
The key component that makes a compressor centrifugal is the centrifugal
impeller, Figure 0.1, which contains a rotating set of vanes (or blades) that
gradually raises the energy of the working gas. This is identical to an axial
compressor with the exception that the gases can reach higher velocities and
energy levels through the impeller's increasing radius. In many modern high-
efficiency centrifugal compressors the gas exiting the impeller is traveling
near the speed of sound.
Impellers are designed in many configurations including "open" (visible
blades), "covered or shrouded", "with splitters" (every other inducer removed)
and "w/o splitters" (all full blades). Both Figures 0.1 and 3.1 show open
impellers with splitters. Most modern high efficiency impellers use "backsweep"
in the blade shape.[6][18][19]
Euler's pump_and_turbine_equation, plays an important role in understanding
impeller performance.
**** Diffuser[edit] ****
The next key component to the simple centrifugal compressor is the diffuser.[7]
[8][19] Downstream of the impeller in the flow path, it is the diffuser's
responsibility to convert the kinetic energy (high velocity) of the gas into
pressure by gradually slowing (diffusing) the gas velocity. Diffusers can be
vaneless, vaned or an alternating combination. High efficiency vaned diffusers
are also designed over a wide range of solidities from less than 1 to over 4.
Hybrid versions of vaned diffusers include: wedge, channel, and pipe diffusers.
Some turbochargers have no diffuser.
Bernoulli's_fluid_dynamic_principle plays an important role in understanding
diffuser performance.
**** Collector[edit] ****
The collector of a centrifugal compressor can take many shapes and forms.[7]
[19] When the diffuser discharges into a large empty chamber, the collector may
be termed a Plenum. When the diffuser discharges into a device that looks
somewhat like a snail shell, bull's horn or a French horn, the collector is
likely to be termed a volute or scroll. As the name implies, a collectorâs
purpose is to gather the flow from the diffuser discharge annulus and deliver
this flow to a downstream pipe. Either the collector or the pipe may also
contain valves and instrumentation to control the compressor.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Below, is a partial list of centrifugal compressor applications each with a
brief description of some of the general characteristics possessed by those
compressors. To start this list two of the most well-known centrifugal
compressor applications are listed; gas turbines and turbochargers.[5]
Figure 4.1 â Jet_engine cutaway showing the centrifugal compressor and other
parts.
Figure 4.2 â Jet_engine cross section showing the centrifugal compressor and
other parts.
    * In gas_turbines and auxiliary power units.[20] Ref. Figures 4.1â4.2In
      their simple form, modern gas turbines operate on the Brayton cycle. (ref
      Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and centrifugal compressors are used to
      provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include
      centrifugal compressors include small aircraft engines (ie turboshafts,
      turboprops and turbofans), auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The
      industry standards applied to all of the centrifugal compressors used in
      aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize
      both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers
      used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings.
      Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-
      axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest,
      these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected
      back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing. This need
      arises from the impeller's deflections experienced from start-up to full
      speed/full temperature which can be 100 times larger than the expected
      hot running clearance of the impeller.
    * In automotive engine and diesel_engine turbochargers and superchargers.
      [21] Ref. Figure 1.1Centrifugal compressors used in conjunction with
      reciprocating internal combustion engines are known as turbochargers if
      driven by the engineâs exhaust gas and turbo-superchargers if
      mechanically driven by the engine. Standards set by the industry for
      turbochargers may have been established by SAE.[22] Ideal gas properties
      often work well for the design, test and analysis of turbocharger
      centrifugal compressor performance.
    * In pipeline_compressors of natural_gas to move the gas from the
      production site to the consumer.[23]Centrifugal compressors for such uses
      may be one- or multi-stage and driven by large gas turbines. Standards
      set by the industry (ANSI/API, ASME) result in large thick casings to
      maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered
      style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of
      compressor is also often termed an API-style. The power needed to drive
      these compressors is most often in the thousands of horsepower (HP). Use
      of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the
      performance of natural gas pipeline centrifugal compressors.
    * In oil_refineries, natural-gas_processing, petrochemical and chemical
      plants.[23]Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often one-shaft
      multi-stage and driven by large steam or gas turbines. Their casings are
      often termed horizontally split or barrel. Standards set by the industry
      (ANSI/API, ASME) for these compressors result in large thick casings to
      maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered
      style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of
      compressor is also often termed API-style. The power needed to drive
      these compressors is most often in the thousands of HP. Use of real gas
      properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze their
      performance.
    * Air-conditioning and refrigeration and HVAC: Centrifugal compressors
      quite often supply the compression in water_chillers cycles.[24]Because
      of the wide variety of vapor compression cycles (thermodynamic_cycle,
      thermodynamics) and the wide variety of workings gases (refrigerants),
      centrifugal compressors are used in a wide range of sizes and
      configurations. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design,
      test and analyze the performance of these machines. Standards set by the
      industry for these compressors include ASHRAE, ASME & API.
    * In industry and manufacturing to supply compressed air for all types of
      pneumatic_tools.[25]Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often
      multistage and driven by electric motors. Inter-cooling is often needed
      between stages to control air temperature. Note that the road repair crew
      and the local automobile repair garage find screw compressors better
      adapt to their needs. Standards set by the industry for these compressors
      include ASME and government regulations that emphasize safety. Ideal gas
      relationships are often used to properly design, test and analyze the
      performance of these machines. Carrierâs equation is often used to deal
      with humidity.
    * In air separation plants to manufacture purified end product gases.
      [25]Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often multistage using
      inter-cooling to control air temperature. Standards set by the industry
      for these compressors include ASME and government regulations that
      emphasize safety. Ideal gas relationships are often used to properly
      design, test and analyze the performance of these machines when the
      working gas is air or nitrogen. Other gases require real gas properties.
    * In oil_field re-injection of high pressure natural gas to improve oil
      recovery.[23]Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often one-shaft
      multi-stage and driven by gas turbines. With discharge pressures
      approaching 700 bar, casing are of the barrel style. Standards set by the
      industry (API, ASME) for these compressors result in large thick casings
      to maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered
      style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of
      compressor is also often termed API-style. Use of real gas properties is
      needed to properly design, test and analyze their performance.
***** Performance[edit] *****
Figure 5.1 â Brayton_cycle. Illustration of the Brayton cycle as applied to a
gas turbine.
Figure 5.2 â Example centrifugal compressor performance map.
While illustrating a gas turbine's Brayton cycle,[12] Figure 5.1 includes
example plots of pressure-specific volume and temperature-entropy. These types
of plots are fundamental to understanding centrifugal compressor performance at
one operating point. Studying these two plots further we see that the pressure
rises between the compressor inlet (station 1) and compressor exit (station 2).
At the same time, it is easy to see that the specific volume decreases or
similarly the density increases. Studying the temperature-entropy plot we see
the temperature increase with increasing entropy (loss). If we assume dry air,
and ideal gas equation of state and an isentropic process, we have enough
information to define the pressure ratio and efficiency for this one point.
Unfortunately, we are missing several other key pieces of information if we
wish to apply the centrifugal compressor to another application.
Figure 5.2, a centrifugal compressor performance map (either test or
estimated), shows flow, pressure ratio for each of 4 speed-lines (total of 23
data points). Also included are constant efficiency contours. Centrifugal
compressor performance presented in this form provides enough information to
match the hardware represented by the map to a simple set of end-user
requirements.
Compared to estimating performance which is very cost effective (thus useful in
design), testing, while costly, is still the most precise method.[9] Further,
testing centrifugal compressor performance is very complex. Professional
societies such as ASME (i.e. PTCâ10, Fluid Meters Handbook, PTC-19.x),[26]
ASHRAE (ASHRAE_Handbook) and API (ANSI/API 617-2002, 672-2007)[23][25] have
established standards for detailed experimental methods and analysis of test
results. Despite this complexity, a few basic concepts in performance can be
presented by examining an example test performance map.
**** Performance maps[edit] ****
Pressure ratio and flow are the main parameters[12][23][25][26] needed to match
the Figure 5.2 performance map to a simple compressor application. In this
case, it can be assumed that the inlet temperature is sea-level standard.
Making this assumption in a real case would be a significant error. A detailed
inspection of Figure 5.2 shows:
    * Corrected mass flow: 0.04 â 0.34 kg/s
    * Total_pressure ratio, inlet to discharge (PRt-t = Pt,discharge/Pt,inlet):
      1.0 â 2.6
As is standard practice, Figure 5.2 has a horizontal axis labeled with a flow
parameter. While flow measurements use a wide variety unit specifications, all
fit one of 2 categories:
*** Mass flow per unit time[edit] ***
Mass flows, such as kg/s, are the easiest to use in practice as there is little
room for confusion. Questions remaining would involve inlet or outlet (which
might involve leakage from the compressor or moisture condensation). For
atmospheric air, the mass flow may be wet or dry (including or excluding
humidity). Often, the mass flow specification will be presented on an
equivalent Mach number basis. It is standard in these cases that the equivalent
temperature, equivalent pressure and gas is specified explicitly or implied at
a standard condition.
*** Volume flow per unit time[edit] ***
In contrast, all volume flow specifications require the additional
specification of density. Bernoulli's fluid dynamic principal is of great value
in understanding this problem. Confusion arises through either inaccuracies or
misuse of pressure, temperature and gas constants.
Also as is standard practice, Figure 5.2 has a vertical axis labeled with a
pressure parameter. The variety of pressure measurement units is also vast. In
this case, they all fit one of three categories:
    * The delta increase or rise from inlet to exit (Manometer style)
    * The measured discharge pressure (force)
    * The force ratio (ratio, exit/inlet)
Other features common to performance maps are:
*** Constant speed lines[edit] ***
The two most common methods used for testing centrifugal compressors is to test
along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant throttle. If the
shaft speed is held constant, test points are taken along a constant speed line
by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is held
constant, test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine
practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate the most common method; lines
of constant speed. In this case we see data points connected via straight lines
at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM. The first three speed lines have 6
points each while the highest speed line has five.
*** Constant efficiency islands[edit] ***
The next feature to be discussed is the oval shaped curves representing islands
of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56%
efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard
practice is to interpret these efficiencies as isentropic rather than
polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-
dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified,
it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant
power could just as easily be substituted.
*** Design or guarantee point(s)[edit] ***
Regarding gas turbine operation and performance, there may be a series of
guaranteed points established for the gas turbineâs centrifugal compressor.
These requirements are of secondary importance to the overall gas turbine
performance as a whole. For this reason it is only necessary to summarize that
in the ideal case, the lowest specific fuel consumption would occur when the
centrifugal compressors peak efficiency curve coincides with the gas turbine's
required operation line.
In contrast to gas turbines, most other applications (including industrial)
need to meet a less stringent set of performance requirements. Historically,
centrifugal compressors applied to industrial applications were needed to
achieve performance at a specific flow and pressure. Modern industrial
compressors are often needed to achieve specific performance goals across a
range of flows and pressures; thus taking a significant step toward the
sophistication seen in gas turbine applications.
If the compressor represented by Figure 5.2 is used in a simple application,
any point (pressure and flow) within the 76% efficiency would provide very
acceptable performance. An "End User" would be very happy with the performance
requirements of 2.0 pressure ratio at 0.21 kg/s.
**** Surge[edit] ****
Surge - is a flow phenomenon at low mass flow rate operation for which the
impeller cannot add enough energy to overcome the system resistance or
backpressure.[27] At low mass flow rate operation, the pressure ratio over the
impeller is high. The high back pressure, downstream of the impeller, pushes
flow back over the tips of the rotor blades towards the impeller eye (inlet).
[28] This rapid flow reversal (i.e., surge) exhibits a strong rotational
component, which affects the flow angles at the leading edge of the blades. The
deterioration of the flow angles causes the impeller to be inefficient and less
flow is delivered downstream. (Therefore, surge is sometimes referred to as
axi-symmetric stall.) Thereby, the plenum downstream of the impeller is emptied
and the (back) pressure drops. As a result, less flow reverses over the rotor
tips and the impeller gains becomes again efficient. This cyclic events cause
large vibrations, increase temperature and change rapidly the axial thrust.
These occurrences can damage the rotor seals, rotor bearings, the compressor
driver and cycle operation. Most turbomachines are designed to easily withstand
occasional surging. However, if the machine is forced to surge repeatedly for a
long period of time, or if it is poorly designed, repeated surges can result in
a catastrophic failure. Of particular interest, is that while turbomachines may
be very durable, the cycles/processes that they are used within can be far less
robust.
*** Surge line[edit] ***
The surge-line shown in Figure 5.2 is the curve that passes through the lowest
flow points of each of the four speed lines. As a test map, these points would
be the lowest flow points possible to record a stable reading within the test
facility/rig. In many industrial applications it may be necessary to increase
the stall line due to the system backpressure. For example, at 100% RPM
stalling flow might increase from approximately 0.170 kg/s to 0.215 kg/
s because of the positive slope of the pressure ratio curve.
As stated earlier, the reason for this is that the high-speed line in Figure
5.2 exhibits a stalling characteristic or positive slope within that range of
flows. When placed in a different system those lower flows might not be
achievable because of interaction with that system. System resistance or
adverse pressure is proven mathematically to be the critical contributor to
compressor surge.
**** Maximum flow line versus choke[edit] ****
Choke occurs under one of 2 conditions. Typically for high speed equipment, as
flow increases the velocity of the flow can approach sonic speed somewhere
within the compressor stage. This location may occur at the impeller inlet
"throat" or at the vaned diffuser inlet "throat". In contrast, for lower speed
equipment, as flows increase, losses increase such that the pressure ratio
eventually drops to 1:1. In this case, the occurrence of choke is unlikely.
The speed lines of gas turbine centrifugal compressors typically exhibit choke.
This is a situation where the pressure ratio of a speed line drops rapidly
(vertically) with little or no change in flow. In most cases the reason for
this is that close to Mach 1 velocities have been reached somewhere within the
impeller and/or diffuser generating a rapid increase in losses. Higher pressure
ratio turbocharger centrifugal compressors exhibit this same phenomenon. Real
choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach
number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.
The maximum flow line, shown in Figure 5.2, is the curve that passes through
the highest flow points of each speed line. Upon inspection it may be noticed
that each of these points has been taken near 56% efficiency. Selecting a low
efficiency (<60%) is the most common practice used to terminate compressor
performance maps at high flows. Another factor that is used to establish the
maximum flow line is a pressure ratio near or equal to 1. The 50% speed line
may be considered an example of this.
The shape of Figure 5.2's speed lines provides a good example of why it is
inappropriate to use the term choke in association with a maximum flow of all
centrifugal compressor speed lines. In summary; most industrial and commercial
centrifugal compressors are selected or designed to operate at or near their
highest efficiencies and to avoid operation at low efficiencies. For this
reason there is seldom a reason to illustrate centrifugal compressor
performance below 60% efficiency.
Many industrial and commercial multistage compressor performance maps exhibits
this same vertical characteristic for a different reason related to what is
known as stage stacking.
**** Other operating limits[edit] ****
  Minimum operating speed
      The minimum speed for acceptable operation, below this value the
      compressor may be controlled to stop or go into an "Idle" condition.
  Maximum allowable speed
      The maximum operating speed for the compressor. Beyond this value
      stresses may rise above prescribed limits and rotor vibrations may
      increase rapidly. At speeds above this level the equipment will likely
      become very dangerous and be controlled to lower speeds.

***** Dimensional analysis[edit] *****
To weigh the advantages between centrifugal compressors it is important to
compare 8 parameters classic to turbomachinery. Specifically, pressure rise
(p), flow (Q), angular speed (N), power (P), density (Ï), diameter (D),
viscosity (Î¼) and elasticity (e). This creates a practical problem when trying
to experimentally determine the effect of any one parameter. This is because it
is nearly impossible to change one of these parameters independently.
The method of procedure known as the Buckingham Ï theorem can help solve this
problem by generating 5 dimensionless forms of these parameters.[1][7][13]
These Pi parameters provide the foundation for "similitude" and the "affinity-
laws" in turbomachinery. They provide for the creation of additional
relationships (being dimensionless) found valuable in the characterization of
performance.
For the example below Head will be substituted for pressure and sonic velocity
will be substituted for elasticity.

**** Buckingham Î  theorem[edit] ****
Main article: Buckingham_Ï_theorem
The three independent dimensions used in this procedure for turbomachinery are:

**** Classic turbomachinery similitude[edit] ****
Completing the task of following the formal procedure results in generating
this classic set of five dimensionless parameters for turbomachinery. Full
similitude is achieved when each of the 5 Pi-parameters are equivalent. This of
course would mean the two turbomachines being compared are geometrically
similar and running at the same operating point.

Turbomachinery analysts gain tremendous insight into performance by comparisons
of these 5 parameters with efficiencies and loss coefficients which are also
dimensionless. In general application, the flow coefficient and head
coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal
compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the
Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for
pumps, the Reynolds number becomes of secondary importance and the velocity
coefficient almost irrelevant. It may be found interesting that the speed
coefficient may be chosen to define the y-axis of Figure 1.1, while at the same
time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the z-axis.
**** Other dimensionless combinations[edit] ****
Demonstrated in the table below is another value of dimensional analysis. Any
number of new dimensionless parameters can be calculated through exponents and
multiplication. For example, a variation of the first parameter shown below is
popularly used in aircraft engine system analysis. The third parameter is a
simplified dimensional variation of the first and second. This third definition
is applicable with strict limitations. The fourth parameter, specific speed, is
very well known and useful in that it removes diameter. The fifth parameter,
specific diameter, is a less often discussed dimensionless parameter found
useful by Balje.[29]

specific diameter coefficient may be in place of diameter to define the z-axis.

***** Aero-thermodynamic fundamentals[edit] *****
The following equations outline a fully three-dimensional mathematical problem
that is very difficult to solve even with simplifying assumptions.[5][30] Until
recently, limitations in computational power, forced these equations to be
simplified to an Inviscid two-dimensional problem with pseudo losses. Before
the advent of computers, these equations were almost always simplified to a
one-dimensional problem.
Solving this one-dimensional problem is still valuable today and is often
termed mean-line analysis. Even with all of this simplification it still
requires large textbooks to outline and large computer programs to solve
practically.
**** Conservation of mass[edit] ****
Also termed continuity, this fundamental equation written in general form is as
follows:

**** Conservation of momentum[edit] ****
Also termed the NavierâStokes_equations, this fundamental is derivable from
Newton's_second_law when applied to fluid_motion. Written in compressible form
for a Newtonian fluid, this equation may be written as follows:

**** Conservation of energy[edit] ****
The first_law_of_thermodynamics is the statement of the conservation of energy.
Under specific conditions, the operation of a Centrifugal compressor is
considered a reversible process. For a reversible process, the total amount of
heat added to a system can be expressed as     &#x03B4; Q = T d S
{\displaystyle \delta Q=TdS}  [\delta Q=TdS] where     T   {\displaystyle T}
[T] is temperature and     S   {\displaystyle S}  [S] is entropy. Therefore,
for a reversible process:
         d U = T d S &#x2212; p d V .    {\displaystyle dU=TdS-pdV.\,}
      [dU=TdS-pdV.\,]
Since U, S and V are thermodynamic functions of state, the above relation holds
also for non-reversible changes. The above equation is known as the fundamental
thermodynamic_relation.
**** Equation of state[edit] ****
The classical ideal_gas_law may be written:
          &#xA0; p V = n R T  .   {\displaystyle {\ pV=nRT}.}  [{\ pV=nRT}.]
The ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows
          &#xA0; p = &#x03C1; ( &#x03B3; &#x2212; 1 ) U    {\displaystyle {\
      p=\rho (\gamma -1)U}}  [{\ p=\rho (\gamma -1)U}]
where     &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is the density,
&#x03B3; =  C  p    /   C  v     {\displaystyle \gamma =C_{p}/C_{v}}  [\gamma
=C_{p}/C_{v}] is the adiabatic index (ratio_of_specific_heats),     U =  C  v
T   {\displaystyle U=C_{v}T}  [{\displaystyle U=C_{v}T}] is the internal energy
per unit mass (the "specific internal energy"),      C  v     {\displaystyle C_
{v}}  [C_{v}] is the specific heat at constant volume, and      C  p
{\displaystyle C_{p}}  [C_{p}] is the specific heat at constant pressure.
With regard to the equation of state, it is important to remember that while
air and nitrogen properties (near standard atmospheric conditions) are easily
and accurately estimated by this simple relationship, there are many
centrifugal compressor applications where the ideal relationship is inadequate.
For example, centrifugal compressors used for large air conditioning systems
(water chillers) use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as
an ideal gas. Another example are centrifugal compressors design and built for
the petroleum industry. Most of the hydrocarbon gases such as methane and
ethylene are best modeled as a real_gas equation_of_state rather than ideal
gases. The Wikipedia entry for equations of state is very thorough.
***** Pros and cons[edit] *****
  Pros
    * Centrifugal compressors offer the advantages of simplicity of
      manufacturing and relatively low cost. This is due to requiring fewer
      stages to achieve the same pressure rise.
    * Centrifugal compressors are used throughout industry because they have
      fewer rubbing parts, are relatively energy efficient, and give higher and
      non-oscillating constant airflow than a similarly sized reciprocating
      compressor or any other positive_displacement_pump.
    * Centrifugal compressors are mostly used as turbochargers and in small gas
      turbine engines like in an APU (auxiliary_power_unit) and as main engine
      for smaller aircraft like helicopters. A significant reason for this is
      that with current technology, the equivalent airflow axial_compressor
      will be less efficient due primarily to a combination of rotor and
      variable stator tip-clearance losses.
  Cons
    * Their main drawback is that they cannot achieve the high compression
      ratio of reciprocating compressors without multiple stages. There are few
      one-stage centrifugal compressors capable of pressure ratios over 10:1,
      due to stress considerations which severely limit the compressor's
      safety, durability and life expectancy.
    * Centrifugal compressors are impractical, compared to axial compressors,
      for use in large gas_turbines and turbojet engines propelling large
      aircraft, due to the resulting weight and stress, and to the frontal area
      presented by the large diameter of the radial diffuser.
***** Structural mechanics, manufacture and design compromise[edit] *****
Ideally, centrifugal compressor impellers have thin air-foil blades that are
strong, each mounted on a light rotor. This material would be easy to machine
or cast and inexpensive. Additionally, it would generate no operating noise,
and have a long life while operating in any environment.[clarification_needed]
From the very start of the aero-thermodynamic design process,the aerodynamic
considerations and optimizations [29,30] are critical to have a successful
design. during the design, the centrifugal impeller's material and
manufacturing method must be accounted for within the design, whether it be
plastic for a vacuum cleaner blower, aluminum alloy for a turbocharger, steel
alloy for an air compressor or titanium alloy for a gas turbine. It is a
combination of the centrifugal compressor impeller shape, its operating
environment, its material and its manufacturing method that determines the
impeller's structural integrity.
