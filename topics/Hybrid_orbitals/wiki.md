Mixing (superposition) of atomic orbitals in chemistry
In chemistry, orbital hybridisation (or hybridization) is the concept of mixing
atomic_orbitals into new hybrid orbitals (with different energies, shapes,
etc., than the component atomic orbitals) suitable for the pairing of electrons
to form chemical_bonds in valence_bond_theory. Hybrid orbitals are very useful
in the explanation of molecular_geometry and atomic bonding properties and are
symmetrically disposed in space. Although sometimes taught together with the
valence_shell_electron-pair_repulsion_(VSEPR)_theory, valence bond and
hybridisation are in fact not related to the VSEPR model.[1]

***** History and uses[edit] *****
Chemist Linus_Pauling first developed the hybridisation theory in 1931 to
explain the structure of simple molecules such as methane (CH4) using atomic
orbitals.[2] Pauling pointed out that a carbon atom forms four bonds by using
one s and three p orbitals, so that "it might be inferred" that a carbon atom
would form three bonds at right angles (using p orbitals) and a fourth weaker
bond using the s orbital in some arbitrary direction. In reality, methane has
four bonds of equivalent strength separated by the tetrahedral bond angle of
109.5Ã‚Â°. Pauling explained this by supposing that in the presence of four
hydrogen atoms, the s and p orbitals form four equivalent combinations or
hybrid orbitals, each denoted by sp3 to indicate its composition, which are
directed along the four C-H bonds.[3] This concept was developed for such
simple chemical systems, but the approach was later applied more widely, and
today it is considered an effective heuristic for rationalising the structures
of organic_compounds. It gives a simple orbital picture equivalent to Lewis
structures.
Hybridisation theory is an integral part of organic_chemistry, one of the most
compelling examples being Baldwin's_rules. For drawing reaction mechanisms
sometimes a classical bonding picture is needed with two atoms sharing two
electrons.[4] Hybridisation theory explains bonding in alkenes[5] and methane.
[6] The amount of p character or s character, which is decided mainly by
orbital hybridisation, can be used to reliably predict molecular properties
such as acidity or basicity.[7]
***** Overview[edit] *****
Orbitals are a model representation of the behaviour of electrons within
molecules. In the case of simple hybridisation, this approximation is based on
atomic_orbitals, similar to those obtained for the hydrogen atom, the only
neutral atom for which the SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger_equation can be solved exactly. In
heavier atoms, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, the atomic orbitals used
are the 2s and 2p orbitals, similar to excited state orbitals for hydrogen.
Hybrid orbitals are assumed to be mixtures of atomic orbitals, superimposed on
each other in various proportions. For example, in methane, the C hybrid
orbital which forms each carbonÃ¢Â€Â“hydrogen bond consists of 25% s character and
75% p character and is thus described as sp3 (read as s-p-three) hybridised.
Quantum_mechanics describes this hybrid as an sp3 wavefunction of the form N(s
+ âˆš3pÃÂƒ), where N is a normalisation_constant (here 1/2) and pÃÂƒ is a p orbital
directed along the C-H axis to form a sigma_bond. The ratio of coefficients
(denoted ÃÂ» in general) is âˆš3 in this example. Since the electron_density
associated with an orbital is proportional to the square of the wavefunction,
the ratio of p-character to s-character is ÃÂ»2 = 3. The p character or the
weight of the p component is N2ÃÂ»2 = 3/4.
***** Types of hybridisation[edit] *****
**** sp3[edit] ****
Four sp3 orbitals.
Hybridisation describes the bonding atoms from an atom's point of view. For a
tetrahedrally coordinated carbon (e.g., methane CH4), the carbon should have 4
orbitals with the correct symmetry to bond to the 4 hydrogen atoms.
Carbon's ground_state configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p2 or more easily read:
C Ã¢Â†Â‘ÃÃ¢Â†Â‘ÃÃ¢Â†Ã¢Â†Â 
  1s     2s     2p  2p  2p
The carbon atom can use its two singly occupied p-type orbitals, to form two
covalent_bonds with two hydrogen atoms, yielding the singlet methylene CH2, the
simplest carbene. The carbon atom can also bond to four hydrogen atoms by an
excitation (or promotion) of an electron from the doubly occupied 2s orbital to
the empty 2p orbital, producing four singly occupied orbitals.
C* Ã¢Â†Â‘ÃÃ¢Â†Ã¢Â†Ã¢Â†Ã¢Â†Â‘
   1s     2s  2p  2p  2p
The energy released by formation of two additional bonds more than compensates
for the excitation energy required, energetically favouring the formation of
four C-H bonds.
Quantum mechanically, the lowest energy is obtained if the four bonds are
equivalent, which requires that they are formed from equivalent orbitals on the
carbon. A set of four equivalent orbitals can be obtained that are linear
combinations of the valence-shell (core orbitals are almost never involved in
bonding) s and p wave functions,[8] which are the four sp3 hybrids.
C* Ã¢Â†Â‘ÃÃ¢Â†Ã¢Â†Ã¢Â†Ã¢Â†Â‘
   1s     sp3 sp3 sp3 sp3
In CH4, four sp3 hybrid orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen 1s orbitals,
yielding four ÃÂƒ_(sigma)_bonds (that is, four single covalent bonds) of equal
length and strength.

translates into [Methane's_tetrahedral_shape]
**** sp2[edit] ****
Three sp2 orbitals.
Ethene structure
Other carbon compounds and other molecules may be explained in a similar way.
For example, ethene (C2H4) has a double bond between the carbons.
For this molecule, carbon sp2 hybridises, because one ÃÂ€_(pi)_bond is required
for the double_bond between the carbons and only three ÃÂƒ bonds are formed per
carbon atom. In sp2 hybridisation the 2s orbital is mixed with only two of the
three available 2p orbitals,
C* Ã¢Â†Â‘ÃÃ¢Â†Ã¢Â†Ã¢Â†Ã¢Â†Â‘
   1s     sp2 sp2 sp2 2p
forming a total of three sp2 orbitals with one remaining p orbital. In ethylene
(ethene) the two carbon atoms form a ÃÂƒ bond by overlapping one sp2 orbital
from each carbon atom. The ÃÂ€ bond between the carbon atoms perpendicular to
the molecular plane is formed by 2pÃ¢Â€Â“2p overlap. Each carbon atom forms
covalent CÃ¢Â€Â“H bonds with two hydrogens by sÃ¢Â€Â“sp2 overlap, all with 120Ã‚Â° bond
angles. The hydrogenÃ¢Â€Â“carbon bonds are all of equal strength and length, in
agreement with experimental data.
**** sp[edit] ****
Two sp orbitals
The chemical bonding in compounds such as alkynes with triple_bonds is
explained by sp hybridisation. In this model, the 2s orbital is mixed with only
one of the three p orbitals,
C* Ã¢Â†Â‘ÃÃ¢Â†Ã¢Â†Ã¢Â†Ã¢Â†Â‘
   1s     sp  sp  2p  2p
resulting in two sp orbitals and two remaining p orbitals. The chemical bonding
in acetylene (ethyne) (C2H2) consists of spÃ¢Â€Â“sp overlap between the two carbon
atoms forming a ÃÂƒ bond and two additional ÃÂ€_bonds formed by pÃ¢Â€Â“p overlap.
Each carbon also bonds to hydrogen in a ÃÂƒ sÃ¢Â€Â“sp overlap at 180Ã‚Â° angles.
***** Hybridisation and molecule shape[edit] *****
Hybridisation helps to explain molecule_shape, since the angles between bonds
are (approximately) equal to the angles between hybrid orbitals, as explained
above for the tetrahedral geometry of methane. As another example, the three
sp2 hybrid orbitals are at angles of 120Ã‚Â° to each other, so this hybridisation
favours trigonal_planar_molecular_geometry with bond angles of 120Ã‚Â°. Other
examples are given in the table below.

angles corresponding to sd4 hybridisation as there is no regular 10-vertex
polyhedron. Nonetheless, molecules such as Ta(CH3)5 with sd4 hybridisation
adopt a square_pyramidal shape.

In this notation, d orbitals of main group atoms are listed after the s and p
orbitals since they have the same principal quantum number (n), while d
orbitals of transition metals are listed first since the s and p orbitals have
a higher n. Thus for AX6 molecules, sp3d2 hybridisation in the S atom involves
3s, 3p and 3d orbitals, while d2sp3 for Mo involves 4d, 5s and 5p orbitals.
*** Contrary evidence[edit] ***
In 1990, Magnusson published a seminal work definitively excluding the role of
d-orbital hybridisation in bonding in hypervalent compounds of second-row
(period_3) elements, ending a point of contention and confusion. Part of the
confusion originates from the fact that d-functions are essential in the basis
sets used to describe these compounds (or else unreasonably high energies and
distorted geometries result). Also, the contribution of the d-function to the
molecular wavefunction is large. These facts were incorrectly interpreted to
mean that d-orbitals must be involved in bonding.[14][15]
For transition metal centres, the d and s orbitals are the primary valence
orbitals, which are only weakly supplemented by the p orbitals.[16] The
question of whether the p orbitals actually participate in bonding has not been
definitively resolved, but all studies indicate they play a minor role.
**** Resonance[edit] ****
In light of computational_chemistry, a better treatment would be to invoke
sigma_bond resonance in addition to hybridisation, which implies that each
resonance structure has its own hybridisation scheme. For main group compounds,
all resonance structures must obey the octet_(8-electron)_rule. For transition
metal compounds, the resonance structures that obey the duodectet_(12-electron)
rule[17] suffice to describe bonding, with optional inclusion of dmspn
resonance structures.

***** Isovalent hybridisation[edit] *****
Main article: Isovalent_hybridisation
Although ideal hybrid orbitals can be useful, in reality most bonds require
orbitals of intermediate character. This requires an extension to include
flexible weightings of atomic orbitals of each type (s, p, d) and allows for a
quantitative depiction of bond formation when the molecular geometry deviates
from ideal bond angles. The amount of p-character is not restricted to integer
values; i.e., hybridisations like sp2.5 are also readily described.
The hybridisation of bond orbitals is determined by Bent's_rule: "Atomic s
character concentrates in orbitals directed towards electropositive
substituents".
**** Molecules with lone pairs[edit] ****
For molecules with lone pairs, the bonding orbitals are isovalent spx hybrids.
For example, the two bond-forming hybrid orbitals of oxygen in water can be
described as sp4.0 to give the interorbital angle of 104.5Ã‚Â°.[19] This means
that they have 20% s character and 80% p character and does not imply that a
hybrid orbital is formed from one s and four p orbitals on oxygen since the 2p
subshell of oxygen only contains three p orbitals. The shapes of molecules with
lone pairs are:
    * Trigonal_pyramidal (>90Ã‚Â°)
          o Three spx bond hybrids
          o E.g., NH3
    * Bent (>90Ã‚Â°)
          o Two spx bond hybrids
          o E.g., SO2, H2O
In such cases, there are two mathematically equivalent ways of representing
lone pairs. They can be represented by orbitals of sigma and pi symmetry
similar to molecular orbital theory or by equivalent orbitals similar to VSEPR
theory.
*** Hypervalent molecules[edit] ***
For hypervalent molecules with lone pairs, the bonding scheme can be split into
a hypervalent component and a component consisting of isovalent spx bond
hybrids. The hypervalent component consists of resonant bonds using p orbitals.
The table below shows how each shape is related to the two components and their
respective descriptions.

***** Hybridisation defects[edit] *****
Hybridisation of s and p orbitals to form effective spx hybrids requires that
they have comparable radial extent. While 2p orbitals are on average less than
10% larger than 2s, in part attributable to the lack of a radial node in 2p
orbitals, 3p orbitals which have one radial node, exceed the 3s orbitals by
20Ã¢Â€Â“33%.[20] The difference in extent of s and p orbitals increases further
down a group. The hybridisation of atoms in chemical bonds can be analysed by
considering localised molecular orbitals, for example using natural localised
molecular orbitals in a natural_bond_orbital (NBO) scheme. In methane, CH4, the
calculated p/s ratio is approximately 3 consistent with "ideal" sp3
hybridisation, whereas for silane, SiH4, the p/s ratio is closer to 2. A
similar trend is seen for the other 2p elements. Substitution of fluorine for
hydrogen further decreases the p/s ratio.[21] The 2p elements exhibit near
ideal hybridisation with orthogonal hybrid orbitals. For heavier p block
elements this assumption of orthogonality cannot be justified. These deviations
from the ideal hybridisation were termed hybridisation defects by Kutzelnigg.
[22]
***** Photoelectron spectra[edit] *****
One misconception concerning orbital hybridisation is that it incorrectly
predicts the ultraviolet_photoelectron_spectra of many molecules. While this is
true if Koopmans'_theorem is applied to localised hybrids, quantum mechanics
requires that the (in this case ionised) wavefunction obey the symmetry of the
molecule which implies resonance in valence bond theory. For example, in
methane, the ionised states (CH4+) can be constructed out of four resonance
structures attributing the ejected electron to each of the four sp3 orbitals. A
linear combination of these four structures, conserving the number of
structures, leads to a triply degenerate T2 state and a A1 state.[23] The
difference in energy between each ionised state and the ground state would be
an ionisation energy, which yields two values in agreement with experiment.
***** Localized MOs vs canonical MOs[edit] *****
Main articles: Localized_molecular_orbitals and Natural_bond_orbital
Bonding orbitals formed from hybrid atomic orbitals may be considered as
localized molecular orbitals, which can be formed from the delocalised orbitals
of molecular orbital theory by an appropriate mathematical transformation. For
molecules in the ground state, this transformation of the orbitals leaves the
total many-electron wave function unchanged. The hybrid orbital description of
the ground state is therefore equivalent to the delocalised orbital description
for ground state total energy and electron density, as well as the molecular
geometry that corresponds to the minimum total energy value.
**** Two localized representations[edit] ****
Main article: Sigma-pi_and_equivalent-orbital_models
Molecules with multiple bonds or multiple lone pairs can have orbitals
represented in terms of sigma and pi symmetry or equivalent orbitals. Different
valence bond methods use either of the two representations, which have
mathematically equivalent total many-electron wave_functions and are related by
a unitary_transformation of the set of occupied molecular orbitals.
For multiple bonds, the sigma-pi representation is the predominant one compared
to the equivalent orbital (bent_bond) representation. In contrast, for multiple
lone pairs, most textbooks use the equivalent orbital representation. However,
the sigma-pi representation is also used, such as by Weinhold and Landis within
the context of natural_bond_orbitals, a localized orbital theory containing
modernized analogs of classical (valence bond/Lewis structure) bonding pairs
and lone pairs.[24] For the hydrogen fluoride molecule, for example, two F lone
pairs are essentially unhybridized p orbitals, while the other is an spx hydrid
orbital. An analogous consideration applies to water (one O lone pair is in a
pure p orbital, another is in an spx hybrid orbital).
