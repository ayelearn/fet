Sodium and fluorine bonding ionically to form sodium_fluoride. Sodium loses its
outer electron to give it a stable electron_configuration, and this electron
enters the fluorine atom exothermically. The oppositely charged ions are then
attracted to each other. The sodium is oxidized, and the fluorine is reduced.

Demonstration of the reaction between a strong oxidising and a reducing agent.
When a few drops of glycerol (mild reducing agent) are added to powdered
potassium_permanganate (strong oxidising agent), a violent redox reaction
accompanied by self-ignition starts.
Redox (short for reductionâoxidation reaction) (pronunciation: /ËrÉdÉks/
redoks or /ËriËdÉks/ reedoks[1]) is a type of chemical_reaction in which the
oxidation_states of atoms are changed. Redox reactions are characterized by the
transfer of electrons between chemical_species, most often with one species
(the reducing agent) undergoing oxidation (losing electrons) while another
species (the oxidizing agent) undergoes reduction (gains electrons).[2] The
chemical species from which the electron is stripped is said to have been
oxidized, while the chemical species to which the electron is added is said to
have been reduced. In other words:
    * Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state
      of an atom by a molecule, an ion, or another atom.
    * Reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state
      of an atom by a molecule, an ion, or another atom.
For example, during the combustion of wood, electrons are transferred from
carbon atoms in the wood to oxygen atoms in the air. The oxygen atoms undergo
reduction, gaining electrons, while the carbon atoms undergo oxidation, losing
electrons. Thus oxygen is the oxidizing agent and carbon the reducing agent in
this reaction.[3] Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with the
formation of oxides from oxygen molecules, oxygen is not necessarily included
in such reactions, as other chemical species can serve the same function.[3]
Redox reactions can occur relatively slowly, as in the formation of rust, or
much more rapidly, as in the case of burning fuel. There are simple redox
processes, such as the oxidation of carbon to yield carbon_dioxide (CO2) or the
reduction of carbon by hydrogen to yield methane (CH4), and more complex
processes such as the oxidation of glucose (C6H12O6) in the human body.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
"Redox" is a portmanteau of the words "reduction" and "oxidation". The word
oxidation originally implied reaction with oxygen to form an oxide, since
dioxygen (O2 (g)) was historically the first recognized oxidizing_agent. Later,
the term was expanded to encompass oxygen-like substances that accomplished
parallel chemical reactions. Ultimately, the meaning was generalized to include
all processes involving loss of electrons.
The word reduction originally referred to the loss in weight upon heating a
metallic ore such as a metal_oxide to extract the metal. In other words, ore
was "reduced" to metal. Antoine_Lavoisier (1743â1794) showed that this loss
of weight was due to the loss of oxygen as a gas. Later, scientists realized
that the metal atom gains electrons in this process. The meaning of reduction
then became generalized to include all processes involving a gain of electrons.
Even though "reduction" seems counter-intuitive when speaking of the gain of
electrons, it might help to think of reduction as the loss of oxygen, which was
its historical meaning. Since electrons are negatively charged, it is also
helpful to think of this as reduction in electrical charge.
The electrochemist John_Bockris has used the words electronation and
deelectronation to describe reduction and oxidation processes respectively when
they occur at electrodes.[4] These words are analogous to protonation and
deprotonation, but they have not been widely adopted by chemists worldwide.
The term "hydrogenation" could be used instead of reduction, since hydrogen is
the reducing agent in a large number of reactions, especially in organic
chemistry and biochemistry. But, unlike oxidation, which has been generalized
beyond its root element, hydrogenation has maintained its specific connection
to reactions that add hydrogen to another substance (e.g., the hydrogenation of
unsaturated fats into saturated fats, RâCH=CHâR + H2 â
RâCH2âCH2âR). The word "redox" was first used in 1928.[5]
***** Definitions[edit] *****
The processes of oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously and cannot happen
independently of one another, similar to the acidâbase_reaction.[3] The
oxidation alone and the reduction alone are each called a half-reaction,
because two half-reactions always occur together to form a whole reaction. When
writing half-reactions, the gained or lost electrons are typically included
explicitly in order that the half-reaction_be_balanced with respect to electric
charge.
Though sufficient for many purposes, these general descriptions are not
precisely correct. Although oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change
in oxidation_state â the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. The
oxidation state of an atom is the fictitious charge that an atom would have if
all bonds between atoms of different elements were 100% ionic. Thus, oxidation
is best defined as an increase in oxidation state, and reduction as a decrease
in oxidation state. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always cause a
change in oxidation state, but there are many reactions that are classed as
"redox" even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving
covalent bonds).
***** Oxidizing and reducing agents[edit] *****
In redox processes, the reductant transfers electrons to the oxidant. Thus, in
the reaction, the reductant or reducing agent loses electrons and is oxidized,
and the oxidant or oxidizing agent gains electrons and is reduced. The pair of
an oxidizing and reducing agent that are involved in a particular reaction is
called a redox pair. A redox couple is a reducing species and its corresponding
oxidizing form, e.g.,
Fe2+
/
Fe3+
**** Oxidizers[edit] ****
The international pictogram for oxidizing chemicals.
Main article: Oxidizing_agent
Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances (cause them to
lose electrons) are said to be oxidative or oxidizing and are known as
oxidizing_agents, oxidants, or oxidizers. That is, the oxidant (oxidizing
agent) removes electrons from another substance, and is thus itself reduced.
And, because it "accepts" electrons, the oxidizing agent is also called an
electron_acceptor. Oxygen is the quintessential oxidizer.
Oxidants are usually chemical substances with elements in high oxidation states
(e.g.,
H
2O
2
, MnOâ
4,
CrO
3
,
Cr
2O2â
7
,
OsO
4
), or else highly electronegative elements (O2, F2, Cl2, Br2) that can gain
extra electrons by oxidizing another substance.
**** Reducers[edit] ****
Main article: Reducing_agent
Substances that have the ability to reduce other substances (cause them to gain
electrons) are said to be reductive or reducing and are known as reducing
agents, reductants, or reducers. The reductant (reducing agent) transfers
electrons to another substance, and is thus itself oxidized. And, because it
donates electrons, the reducing agent is also called an electron_donor.
Electron donors can also form charge_transfer_complexes with electron
acceptors.
Reductants in chemistry are very diverse. Electropositive elemental metals,
such as lithium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and aluminium, are good
reducing agents. These metals donate or give away electrons readily. Hydride
transfer reagents, such as NaBH4 and LiAlH4, are widely used in organic
chemistry,[6][7] primarily in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols.
Another method of reduction involves the use of hydrogen gas (H2) with a
palladium, platinum, or nickel catalyst. These catalytic reductions are used
primarily in the reduction of carbon-carbon double or triple bonds.
***** Standard electrode potentials (reduction potentials)[edit] *****
Each half-reaction has a standard electrode_potential (E0
cell), which is equal to the potential difference or voltage at equilibrium
under standard_conditions of an electrochemical_cell in which the cathode
reaction is the half-reaction considered, and the anode is a standard_hydrogen
electrode where hydrogen is oxidized:
      &#x200b;1⁄2 H2 â H+ + eâ.
The electrode potential of each half-reaction is also known as its reduction
potential E0
red, or potential when the half-reaction takes place at a cathode. The
reduction potential is a measure of the tendency of the oxidizing agent to be
reduced. Its value is zero for H+ + eâ â &#x200b;1⁄2 H2 by definition,
positive for oxidizing agents stronger than H+ (e.g., +2.866 V for F2) and
negative for oxidizing agents that are weaker than H+ (e.g., â0.763 V for
Zn2+).[8]
For a redox reaction that takes place in a cell, the potential difference is:
      E0
      cell = E0
      cathode â E0
      anode
However, the potential of the reaction at the anode was sometimes expressed as
an oxidation potential:
      E0
      ox = âE0
      red.
The oxidation potential is a measure of the tendency of the reducing agent to
be oxidized, but does not represent the physical potential at an electrode.
With this notation, the cell voltage equation is written with a plus sign
      E0
      cell = E0
      red(cathode) + E0
      ox(anode)
***** Examples of redox reactions[edit] *****
Illustration of a redox reaction
A good example is the reaction between hydrogen and fluorine in which hydrogen
is being oxidized and fluorine is being reduced:
      H
      2 + F
      2 â 2 HF
We can write this overall reaction as two half-reactions:
the oxidation reaction:
      H
      2 â 2 H+ + 2 eâ
and the reduction reaction:
      F
      2 + 2 eâ â 2 Fâ
Analyzing each half-reaction in isolation can often make the overall chemical
process clearer. Because there is no net change in charge during a redox
reaction, the number of electrons in excess in the oxidation reaction must
equal the number consumed by the reduction reaction (as shown above).
Elements, even in molecular form, always have an oxidation state of zero. In
the first half-reaction, hydrogen is oxidized from an oxidation state of zero
to an oxidation state of +1. In the second half-reaction, fluorine is reduced
from an oxidation state of zero to an oxidation state of â1.
When adding the reactions together the electrons are canceled:
                   H â2 H+ + 2 eâ
                   2
                   F â2 Fâ
          2 + 2 eâ
      =======================================================================
             H2 + F2 â2 H+ + 2 Fâ
And the ions combine to form hydrogen_fluoride:
      2 H+ + 2 Fâ â 2 HF
The overall reaction is:
      H
      2 + F
      2 â 2 HF
**** Metal displacement[edit] ****
A redox reaction is the force behind an electrochemical_cell like the Galvanic
cell pictured. The battery is made out of a zinc electrode in a ZnSO4 solution
connected with a wire and a porous disk to a copper electrode in a CuSO4
solution.
In this type of reaction, a metal atom in a compound (or in a solution) is
replaced by an atom of another metal. For example, copper is deposited when
zinc metal is placed in a copper(II)_sulfate solution:
Zn(s)+ CuSO4(aq) â ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)
In the above reaction, zinc metal displaces the copper(II) ion from copper
sulfate solution and thus liberates free copper metal.
The ionic equation for this reaction is:
      Zn + Cu2+ â Zn2+ + Cu
As two half-reactions, it is seen that the zinc is oxidized:
      Zn â Zn2+ + 2 eâ
And the copper is reduced:
      Cu2+ + 2 eâ â Cu
**** Other examples[edit] ****
    * The reduction of nitrate to nitrogen in the presence of an acid
      (denitrification):
            2 NOâ
            3 + 10 eâ + 12 H+ â N2 + 6 H2O
    * The combustion of hydrocarbons, such as in an internal_combustion_engine,
      which produces water, carbon_dioxide, some partially oxidized forms such
      as carbon_monoxide, and heat energy. Complete oxidation of materials
      containing carbon produces carbon dioxide.
    * In organic_chemistry, the stepwise oxidation of a hydrocarbon by oxygen
      produces water and, successively, an alcohol, an aldehyde or a ketone, a
      carboxylic_acid, and then a peroxide.
*** Corrosion and rusting[edit] ***
Oxides, such as iron(III)_oxide or rust, which consists of hydrated iron(III)
oxides Fe2O3Â·nH2O and iron(III)_oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)3), form when
oxygen combines with other elements
Iron rusting in pyrite cubes
    * The term corrosion refers to the electrochemical oxidation of metals in
      reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen. Rusting, the formation of iron
      oxides, is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion; it forms as
      a result of the oxidation of iron metal. Common rust often refers to iron
      (III)_oxide, formed in the following chemical reaction:
            4 Fe + 3 O2 â 2 Fe2O3
    * The oxidation of iron(II) to iron(III) by hydrogen_peroxide in the
      presence of an acid:
            Fe2+ â Fe3+ + eâ
            H2O2 + 2 eâ â 2 OHâ
      Overall equation:
            2 Fe2+ + H2O2 + 2 H+ â 2 Fe3+ + 2 H2O
***** Redox reactions in industry[edit] *****
Cathodic_protection is a technique used to control the corrosion of a metal
surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. A simple method of
protection connects protected metal to a more easily corroded "sacrificial
anode" to act as the anode. The sacrificial metal instead of the protected
metal, then, corrodes. A common application of cathodic protection is in
galvanized steel, in which a sacrificial coating of zinc on steel parts
protects them from rust.
Oxidation is used in a wide variety of industries such as in the production of
cleaning_products and oxidizing ammonia to produce nitric_acid, which is used
in most fertilizers.
Redox reactions are the foundation of electrochemical_cells, which can generate
electrical energy or support electrosynthesis. Metal ores often contain metals
in oxidized states such as oxides or sulfides, from which the pure metals are
extracted by smelting at high temperature in the presence of a reducing agent.
The process of electroplating uses redox reactions to coat objects with a thin
layer of a material, as in chrome-plated automotive parts, silver_plating
cutlery, galvanization and gold-plated jewelry.
***** Redox reactions in biology[edit] *****

Bottom: dehydroascorbic_acid (oxidized_form of Vitamin_C)
Many important biological processes involve redox reactions.
Cellular_respiration, for instance, is the oxidation of glucose (C6H12O6) to
CO2 and the reduction of oxygen to water. The summary equation for cell
respiration is:
      C6H12O6 + 6 O2 â 6 CO2 + 6 H2O
The process of cell respiration also depends heavily on the reduction of NAD+
to NADH and the reverse reaction (the oxidation of NADH to NAD+).
Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary, but photosynthesis
is not the reverse of the redox reaction in cell respiration:
      6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light_energy â C6H12O6 + 6 O2
Biological energy is frequently stored and released by means of redox
reactions. Photosynthesis involves the reduction of carbon_dioxide into sugars
and the oxidation of water into molecular oxygen. The reverse reaction,
respiration, oxidizes sugars to produce carbon dioxide and water. As
intermediate steps, the reduced carbon compounds are used to reduce
nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH, which then contributes to the
creation of a proton_gradient, which drives the synthesis of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and is maintained by the reduction of oxygen. In animal
cells, mitochondria perform similar functions. See the Membrane_potential
article.
Free_radical reactions are redox reactions that occur as a part of homeostasis
and killing microorganisms, where an electron detaches from a molecule and then
reattaches almost instantaneously. Free radicals are a part of redox molecules
and can become harmful to the human body if they do not reattach to the redox
molecule or an antioxidant. Unsatisfied free radicals can spur the mutation of
cells they encounter and are, thus, causes of cancer.
The term redox state is often used to describe the balance of GSH/GSSG, NAD+/
NADH and NADP+/NADPH in a biological system such as a cell or organ. The redox
state is reflected in the balance of several sets of metabolites (e.g., lactate
and pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate), whose interconversion is
dependent on these ratios. An abnormal redox state can develop in a variety of
deleterious situations, such as hypoxia, shock, and sepsis. Redox mechanism
also control some cellular processes. Redox proteins and their genes must be
co-located for redox regulation according to the CoRR_hypothesis for the
function of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts.
**** Redox cycling[edit] ****
A wide variety of aromatic_compounds are enzymatically reduced to form free
radicals that contain one more electron than their parent compounds. In
general, the electron donor is any of a wide variety of flavoenzymes and their
coenzymes. Once formed, these anion free radicals reduce molecular oxygen to
superoxide, and regenerate the unchanged parent compound. The net reaction is
the oxidation of the flavoenzyme's coenzymes and the reduction of molecular
oxygen to form superoxide. This catalytic behavior has been described as a
futile_cycle or redox cycling.
***** Redox reactions in geology[edit] *****
Mi_Vida_uranium_mine, near Moab, Utah. The alternating red and white/green
bands of sandstone correspond to oxidized and reduced conditions in groundwater
redox chemistry.
In geology, redox is important to both the formation of minerals and the
mobilization of minerals, and is also important in some depositional
environments. In general, the redox state of most rocks can be seen in the
color of the rock. The rock forms in oxidizing conditions, giving it a red
color. It is then "bleached" to a greenâor sometimes whiteâform when a
reducing fluid passes through the rock. The reduced fluid can also carry
uranium-bearing minerals. Famous examples of redox conditions affecting
geological processes include uranium_deposits and Moqui_marbles.
***** Balancing redox reactions[edit] *****
Describing the overall electrochemical reaction for a redox process requires a
balancing of the component half-reactions for oxidation and reduction. In
general, for reactions in aqueous solution, this involves adding H+, OHâ,
H2O, and electrons to compensate for the oxidation changes.
**** Acidic media[edit] ****
In acidic media, H+ ions and water are added to half-reactions to balance the
overall reaction.
For instance, when manganese(II) reacts with sodium_bismuthate:
      Unbalanced reaction: Mn2+(aq) + NaBiO3(s) â Bi3+(aq) + MnOâ
                           4 (aq)
      Oxidation:           4 H2O(l) + Mn2+(aq) â MnOâ
                           4(aq) + 8 H+(aq) + 5 eâ
      Reduction:           2 eâ + 6 H+ + BiOâ
                           3(s) â Bi3+(aq) + 3 H2O(l)
The reaction is balanced by scaling the two half-cell reactions to involve the
same number of electrons (multiplying the oxidation reaction by the number of
electrons in the reduction step and vice versa):
      8 H2O(l) + 2 Mn2+(aq) â 2 MnOâ
      4(aq) + 16 H+(aq) + 10 eâ
      10 eâ + 30 H+ + 5 BiOâ
      3(s) â 5 Bi3+(aq) + 15 H2O(l)
Adding these two reactions eliminates the electrons terms and yields the
balanced reaction:
      14 H+(aq) + 2 Mn2+(aq) + 5 NaBiO3(s) â 7 H2O(l) + 2 MnOâ
      4(aq) + 5 Bi3+(aq) + 5 Na+
      (aq)
**** Basic media[edit] ****
In basic media, OHâ ions and water are added to half reactions to balance the
overall reaction.
For example, in the reaction between potassium_permanganate and sodium_sulfite:
      Unbalanced reaction: KMnO4 + Na2SO3 + H2O â MnO2 + Na2SO4 + KOH
      Reduction:           3 eâ + 2 H2O + MnOâ
                           4 â MnO2 + 4 OHâ
                           2 OHâ + SO2â
      Oxidation:           3 â SO2â
                           4 + H2O + 2 eâ
Balancing the number of electrons in the two half-cell reactions gives:
      6 eâ + 4 H2O + 2 MnOâ
      4 â 2 MnO2 + 8 OHâ
      6 OHâ + 3 SO2â
      3 â 3 SO2â
      4 + 3 H2O + 6 eâ
Adding these two half-cell reactions together gives the balanced equation:
      2 KMnO4 + 3 Na2SO3 + H2O â 2 MnO2 + 3 Na2SO4 + 2 KOH
***** Mnemonics[edit] *****
The key terms involved in redox are often confusing.[9][10] For example, a
reagent that is oxidized loses electrons; however, that reagent is referred to
as the reducing agent. Likewise, a reagent that is reduced gains electrons and
is referred to as the oxidizing agent.[11] These mnemonics are commonly used by
students to help memorise the terminology:[12]
    * "OIL RIG" â oxidation is loss of electrons, reduction is gain of
      electrons.[9][10][11][12]
    * "LEO the lion says GER" â loss of electrons is oxidation, gain of
      electrons is reduction.[9][10][11][12]
    * "LEORA says GEROA" â loss of electrons is oxidation (reducing agent),
      gain of electrons is reduction (oxidizing agent).[11]
    * "RED CAT" and "AN OX", or "AnOx RedCat" ("an ox-red cat") â reduction
      occurs at the cathode and the anode is for oxidation.
    * "RED CAT gains what AN OX loses" â reduction at the cathode gains
      (electrons) what anode oxidation loses (electrons).
