An invasive species is a species that is not native to a specific location (an
introduced_species), and that has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to
cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.[2]
The term as most often used applies to introduced species that adversely affect
the habitats and bioregions they invade economically, environmentally, or
ecologically. Such species may be either plants or animals and may disrupt by
dominating a region, wilderness_areas, particular habitats, or wildlandâurban
interface land from loss of natural controls (such as predators or herbivores).
This includes plant species labeled as exotic pest plants and invasive exotics
growing in native plant_communities.[3][4][5][6] The European Union defines
"Invasive Alien Species" as those that are, firstly, outside their natural
distribution area, and secondly, threaten biological_diversity.[7][8] The term
is also used by land managers, botanists, researchers, horticulturalists,
conservationists, and the public for noxious_weeds.[9]
The term "invasive" is often poorly defined or very subjective[6] and some
broaden the term to include indigenous or "native" species, that have colonized
natural areas[6] - for example deer considered by some to be overpopulating
their native zones and adjacent suburban gardens in the Northeastern and
Pacific_Coast regions of the United States.[10]
The definition of "native" is also sometimes controversial. For example, the
ancestors of Equus_ferus (modern horses) evolved in North_America and radiated
to Eurasia before becoming locally extinct. Upon returning to North America in
1493 during their hominid-assisted migration, it is debatable as to whether
they were native or exotic to the continent of their evolutionary ancestors.
[11]
Notable examples of invasive plant species include the kudzu_vine, Andean
pampas_grass, and yellow_starthistle. Animal examples include the New_Zealand
mud_snail, feral_pigs, European_rabbits, grey_squirrels, domestic_cats, carp
and ferrets.[12][13]
Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms from distant bio-regions
is a natural phenomenon, but has been accelerated massively by humans, from
their earliest_migrations though to the age_of_discovery, and now international
trade.

***** Causes[edit] *****
Scientists include species and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that,
when combined, establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species.
**** Species based mechanisms[edit] ****
While all species compete to survive, invasive species appear to have specific
traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete native
species. In some cases, the competition is about rates of growth and
reproduction. In other cases, species interact with each other more directly.
Researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers.
One study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species, 86% of the
invasive species could be identified from the traits alone.[14] Another study
found invasive species tended to have only a small subset of the presumed
traits and that many similar traits were found in noninvasive species,
requiring other explanations.[14][15][16] Common invasive species traits
include the following:
    * Fast growth
    * Rapid reproduction
    * High dispersal ability
    * Phenotype_plasticity (the ability to alter growth form to suit current
      conditions)
    * Tolerance of a wide range of environmental conditions (Ecological
      competence)
    * Ability to live off of a wide range of food types (generalist)
    * Association with humans[17]
    * Prior successful invasions[18]
Typically, an introduced species must survive at low population densities
before it becomes invasive in a new location.[19] At low population densities,
it can be difficult for the introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself
in a new location, so a species might reach a location multiple times before it
becomes established. Repeated patterns of human movement, such as ships sailing
to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated
opportunities for establishment (also known as a high propagule_pressure).[20]
An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species
for resources such as nutrients, light, physical space, water, or food. If
these species evolved under great competition or predation, then the new
environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to
proliferate quickly. Ecosystems which are being used to their fullest capacity
by native species can be modeled as zero-sum systems in which any gain for the
invader is a loss for the native. However, such unilateral competitive
superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the
invader) is not the rule.[21][22] Invasive species often coexist with native
species for an extended time, and gradually, the superior competitive ability
of an invasive species becomes apparent as its population grows larger and
denser and it adapts to its new location.

An invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously
unavailable to native species, such as deep water sources accessed by a long
taproot, or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For
example, barbed goatgrass (Aegilops_triuncialis) was introduced to California
on serpentine_soils, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a
high magnesium/calcium ratio, and possible heavy_metal toxicity. Plant
populations on these soils tend to show low density, but goatgrass can form
dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted
poorly to serpentine soils.[23]
Invasive species might alter their environment by releasing chemical compounds,
modifying abiotic factors, or affecting the behaviour of herbivores, creating a
positive or negative impact on other species. Some species, like Kalanchoe
daigremontana, produce allelopathic_compounds, that might have an inhibitory
effect on competing species, and influence some soil processes like carbon and
nitrogen mineralization.[24] Other species like Stapelia_gigantea facilitates
the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing
appropriate microclimatic conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages
of development.[25]
Other examples are Centaurea_solstitialis (yellow starthistle) and Centaurea
diffusa (diffuse_knapweed). These Eastern_European noxious_weeds have spread
through the western and West_Coast_states. Experiments show that 8-
hydroxyquinoline, a chemical produced at the root of C. diffusa, has a negative
effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it. Such co-evolved native
plants have also evolved defenses. C. diffusa and C. solstitialis do not appear
in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors. Success
or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others.
Conversely, examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal
novel weapons to defeat invasiveness.[26][27]
Changes in fire_regimens are another form of facilitation. Bromus_tectorum,
originally from Eurasia, is highly fire-adapted. It not only spreads rapidly
after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity (heat) of fires by
providing large amounts of dry detritus during the fire season in western North
America. In areas where it is widespread, it has altered the local fire regimen
so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing B.
tectorum to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range.[28]
Ecological_facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a
habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species. For example, zebra
mussels increase habitat complexity on lake floors, providing crevices in which
invertebrates live. This increase in complexity, together with the nutrition
provided by the waste products of mussel filter-feeding, increases the density
and diversity of benthic invertebrate communities.[29]
**** Ecosystem-based mechanisms[edit] ****
In ecosystems, the amount of available resources and the extent to which those
resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on
the ecosystem. In stable ecosystems, equilibrium exists in the use of available
resources. These mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has
suffered a disturbance, which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem.
[30]
When changes such as a forest_fire occur, normal succession favors native
grasses and forbs. An introduced species that can spread faster than natives
can use resources that would have been available to native species, squeezing
them out. Nitrogen and phosphorus are often the limiting factors in these
situations.[31]
Every species occupies a niche in its native ecosystem; some species fill large
and varied roles, while others are highly specialized. Some invading species
fill niches that are not used by native species, and they also can create new
niches.[32] An example of this type can be found within the Lampropholis
delicata species of skink.
Ecosystem changes can alter species' distributions. For example, edge_effects
describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is
cleared for agriculture. The boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and
the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners
and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the
boundary habitat.[33]
One interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that
introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is
used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become
invasive in new environments. When bottlenecks and founder_effects cause a
great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic_variation,[34]
the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic
variance. This conversion can actually lead to increased variance in the
founding populations which then allows for rapid_adaptive_evolution.[35]
Following invasion events, selection may initially act on the capacity to
disperse as well as physiological tolerance to the new stressors in the
environment. Adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of
the new environment. These responses would most likely be due to temperature
and climate_change, or the presence of native species whether it be predator or
prey.[36] Adaptations include changes in morphology, physiology, phenology, and
plasticity.
Rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher
fitness and are better suited for their environment. Intraspecific phenotypic
plasticity, pre-adaptation and post-introduction evolution are all major
factors in adaptive evolution.[37] Plasticity in populations allows room for
changes to better suit the individual in its environment. This is key in
adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the
ecosystem that the species has been introduced. The ability to accomplish this
as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness. Pre-
adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in
the success of the introduced species. If the species has adapted to a similar
ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it
is introduced, it is more likely to fare better in the new environment. This,
in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction, all determine if
the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it
will reproduce and thrive.
***** Ecology[edit] *****
**** Traits of invaded ecosystems[edit] ****
In 1958, Charles_S._Elton[38] claimed that ecosystems with higher species
diversity were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available
niches. Other_ecologists later pointed to highly diverse, but heavily invaded
ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more
susceptible to invasion.[39]
This debate hinged on the spatial_scale at which invasion studies were
performed, and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained
unresolved as of 2011. Small-scale studies tended to show a negative
relationship between diversity and invasion, while large-scale studies tended
to show the reverse. The latter result may be a side-effect of invasives'
ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species
interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered.[40][41]
However, this spatial scale dependent pattern of the effects of invasion on
diversity does not seem to hold true when the invader is a vertebrate.[12]
The brown_tree_snake (Boiga irregularis)
Invasion was more likely in ecosystems that were similar to the one in which
the potential invader evolved.[42] Island_ecosystems may be more prone to
invasion because their species faced few strong competitors and predators, or
because their distance from colonizing species populations makes them more
likely to have "open" niches.[43] An example of this phenomenon was the
decimation of native bird populations on Guam by the invasive brown_tree_snake.
[44] Conversely, invaded ecosystems may lack the natural competitors and
predators that check invasives' growth in their native ecosystems.
Invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance, typically human-induced.
[42] Such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish
themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed
ecosystem.[19]
**** Vectors[edit] ****
Non-native species have many vectors, including biogenic vectors, but most
invasions are associated with human activity. Natural range extensions are
common in many species, but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions
in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions, and humans
typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces.[45]
An early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the Pacific
rat (Rattus exulans) to Polynesia.[46]
Chinese_mitten_crab (Eriocheir sinensis)
Vectors include plants or seeds imported for horticulture. The pet_trade moves
animals across borders, where they can escape and become invasive. Organisms
stow away on transport vehicles.
The arrival of invasive propagules to a new site is a function of the site's
invasibility.[47]
Species have also been introduced intentionally. For example, to feel more "at
home," American_colonists formed "Acclimation Societies" that repeatedly
imported birds that were native to Europe to North America and other distant
lands. In 2008, U.S._postal workers in Pennsylvania noticed noises coming from
inside a box from Taiwan; the box contained more than two dozen live beetles.
Agricultural_Research_Service entomologists identified them as rhinoceros
beetle, hercules_beetle, and king_stag_beetle.[48] Because these species were
not native to the U.S., they could have threatened native ecosystems. To
prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the U.S., special handling
and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign
countries. USDA programs such as Smuggling_Interdiction_and_Trade_Compliance
(SITC) attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in America.
Many invasive species, once they are dominant in the area, are essential to the
ecosystem of that area. If they are removed from the location it could be
harmful to that area.[49]
Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction. High demand for
the valuable Chinese_mitten_crab is one explanation for the possible
intentional release of the species in foreign waters.[50][citation_needed]
*** Within the aquatic environment[edit] ***
The development of maritime trade has rapidly affected the way marine organisms
are transported within the ocean. Two ways marine organisms are transported to
new environments are hull fouling and ballast water transport. In fact, Molnar
et al. 2008 documented the pathways of hundreds of marine invasive species and
found that shipping was the dominant mechanism for the transfer of invasive
species.[51]
Cargo ship de-ballasting
Many marine organisms have the capacity to attach themselves to vessel hulls.
Therefore, these organisms are easily transported from one body of water to
another and are a significant risk factor for a biological invasion event.[52]
Unfortunately, controlling for vessel hull fouling is voluntary and there are
no regulations currently in place to manage hull fouling. However, the
governments of California and New_Zealand have announced more stringent control
for vessel hull fouling within their respective jurisdictions.[53]
The other main vector for the transport of non-native aquatic species is
ballast water. Ballast_water taken up at sea and released in port by
transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species
invasions.[47][54] In fact, it is estimated that 10,000 different species, many
of which are non-indigenous, are transported via ballast water each day.[55]
Many of these species are considered harmful and can negatively impact their
new environment. For example, freshwater zebra_mussels, native to the Black,
Caspian and Azov_seas, most likely reached the Great_Lakes via ballast water
from a transoceanic vessel.[56] Zebra mussels outcompete other native organisms
for oxygen and food, such as algae. Although the zebra mussel invasion was
first noted in 1988, and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly
thereafter, the plan had a serious flaw or loophole, whereby ships loaded with
cargo when they reached the Seaway were not tested because their ballast water
tanks were empty. However, even in an empty ballast tank, there remains a
puddle of water filled with organisms that could be released at the next port
(when the tank is filled with water after unloading the cargo, the ship takes
on ballast water which mixes with the puddles and then everything including the
living organisms in the puddles is discharged at the next port).[57] Current
regulations for the Great_Lakes rely on âsalinity shockâ to kill freshwater
organisms left in ballast tanks.[58]
Even though ballast water regulations are in place to protect against
potentially invasive species, there exists a loophole for organisms in the 10-
50 micron size class. For organisms between 10 and 50 microns, such as certain
types of phytoplankton, current regulations allow less than 10 cells per
milliliter be present in discharge from treatment systems.[59] The discharge
gets released when a ship takes on cargo at a port so the discharged water is
not necessarily the same as the receiving body of water. Since many species of
phytoplankton are less than 10 microns in size and reproduce_asexually, only
one cell released into the environment could exponentially grow into many
thousands of cells over a short amount of time. This loophole could have
detrimental effects to the environment. For example, some species in the genus
Pseudo-nitzschia are smaller than 10 microns in width and contain domoic_acid,
a neurotoxin. If toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. are alive in ballast discharge and
get released into their ânew environmentâ they could cause domoic acid
poisoning in shellfish, marine_mammals and birds.[60] Fortunately, human deaths
related to domoic acid poisoning have been prevented because of stringent
monitoring programs that arose after a domoic acid outbreak in Canada in 1987.
[60] Ballast water regulations need to be more rigorous to prevent future
ramifications associated with the potential release of toxic and invasive
phytoplankton.
Another important factor to consider about marine invasive species is the role
of environmental changes associated with climate_change, such as an increase in
ocean_temperature. There have been multiple studies suggesting an increase in
ocean temperature will cause range shifts in organisms,[61][62] which could
have detrimental effects on the environment as new species interactions emerge.
For example, Hua and Hwang proposed that organisms in a ballast tank of a ship
traveling from the temperature zone through tropical waters can experience
temperature fluctuations as much as 20 Â°C.[63] To further examine the effects
of temperature on organisms transported on hulls or in ballast water, Lenz et
al. (2018) carried out study where they conducted a double heat stress
experiment. Their results suggest that heat challenges organisms face during
transport may enhance the stress tolerance of species in their non-native range
by selecting for genetically adapted genotypes that will survive a second
applied heat stress, such as increased ocean temperature in the founder
population.[64] Due to the complexity of climate change induced variations, it
is difficult to predict the nature of temperature-based success of non-native
species in-situ. Since some studies have suggested increased temperature
tolerance of âhijackersâ on shipsâ hulls or in ballast water, it is
necessary to develop more comprehensive fouling and ballast water management
plans in an effort to prevent against future possible invasions as
environmental conditions continue to change around the world.
**** Impacts of wildfire and firefighting[edit] ****
Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem (wildfires, roads,
foot_trails) to colonize an area. Large wildfires can sterilize soils, while
adding a variety of nutrients.[31] In the resulting free-for-all, formerly
entrenched species lose their advantage, leaving more room for invasives. In
such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an
advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire
burns that removes surface vegetation, leaving natives that rely on seeds for
propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.[28]
Wildfires often occur in remote areas, needing fire suppression crews to travel
through pristine forest to reach the site. The crews can bring invasive seeds
with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony
of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the
outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also,
disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover,
exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and wildland-urban
interface areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of
municipalities for defensible_space can result in excessive removal of native
shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition
for invasive plant species.[citation_needed]
Fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the
vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species.
The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In
response, on large fires, washing stations "decontaminate" vehicles before
engaging in suppression activities.[citation_needed] Large wildfires attract
firefighters from remote places, further increasing the potential for seed
transport.[citation_needed]
***** Effects[edit] *****

**** Ecological[edit] ****
Land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species.
Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on
local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant
known as &#x2bb;ae&#x2bb;ae in Hawaii (the indigenous Bacopa_monnieri) is
regarded as a pest species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges
because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered Hawaiian
stilt (Himantopus_mexicanus_knudseni), making these undesirable feeding areas
for the birds.
Multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have
interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable
the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions
of the amethyst_gem_clam (Gemma gemma) and the European green crab (Carcinus
maenas). The gem clam was introduced into California's Bodega_Harbor from the
East_Coast_of_the_United_States a century ago. It had been found in small
quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species
(Nutricola spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green
crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline
of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.[65]
In the Waterberg region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six
centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the
original grassland, resulting in a massive reduction in forage for native
bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been
underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-
establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of
these species are giraffe, blue_wildebeest, impala, kudu and white_rhino.
Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive
plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, Bromus_tectorum), nutrient
cycling (smooth cordgrass Spartina_alterniflora), and hydrology (Tamarix) in
native ecosystems.[66] Invasive species that are closely related to rare native
species have the potential to hybridize with the native species. Harmful
effects of hybridization have led to a decline and even extinction of native
species.[67][68] For example, hybridization with introduced cordgrass, Spartina
alterniflora, threatens the existence of California cordgrass (Spartina
foliosa) in San_Francisco_Bay.[69] Invasive species cause competition for
native species and because of this 400 of the 958 endangered species under the
Endangered_Species_Act are at risk.[70]
**** Geomorphological[edit] ****
Primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and
bioprotection. For example, Kudzu Pueraria_montana, a vine native to Asia was
widely introduced in the southeastern_USA in the early 20th century to control
soil_erosion. While primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation,
bioerosion, and bioconstruction. For example, invasion of Chinese mitten crab
Eriocheir_sinensis have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates.
[71]
**** Economic[edit] ****
Some invaders cause negative benefits towards the economy of the local area.
For example, in the Great_Lakes_Region the sea_lamprey is an invasive species
that acts as a predator. In its original habitat, the sea lamprey used co-
evolution to act as a parasite without killing the host_organism. However, in
the Great Lakes Region, this co-evolutionary link is non existent, so the sea
lamprey acts as a predator, and can consume up to 40 pounds of fish in its 12-
18 month feeding period.[72] Sea lampreys prey on all types of large fish such
as lake_trout and salmon. The sea lampreys' destructive effects towards large
fish negatively affects the fishing industry and has helped collapse the
population of some economy dependent species.[72]
*** Economic opportunities[edit] ***
Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits. For instance, silver_carp
and common_carp can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already
familiar with the product, or processed into pet_foods, or mink feed. Water
hyacinth can be turned into fuel by methane_digesters,[73] and other invasive
plants can also be harvested and utilized as a source of bioenergy.[74]
** Benefits[edit] **
Although most people focus on the negative effects of invasive and non-native
species, they can actually be harmless or even beneficial in some cases.
Ecosystems thrive because of biodiversity and some need non-native species in
order to succeed. There are four major ways that non-natives can be very
beneficial for an ecosystem. The first is that they can provide a suitable
habitat or food source for other organisms. In areas where a native has become
extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can
fill their role. A good example of this is the Tamarisk, a non-native woody
plant, and the Southwestern_Willow_Flycatcher, an endangered bird. 75% of
Southwestern Willow Flycatcher were found to nest in these plants and their
success was the same as the flycatchers that had nested in native plants. The
removal of Tamarisk would be detrimental to Southwestern Willow Flycatcher as
their native nesting sites are unable to be restored.
The second way that non-native species can be beneficial is that they act as
catalysts for restoration. This is because the presence of non-native species
increases the heterogeneity and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This increase in
heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, which
then promotes the growth and reestablishment of native species. Another benefit
of non-native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing
ecosystem engineer. In many cases, non-native species can be introduced to fill
a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species.
Many non-native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep
an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse. An example of this is the
Aldabra_giant_tortoises, which were introduced on several small islands and
have successfully taken over the roles of herbivore and seed disperser. The
last benefit of non-native species is that they provided ecosystem services.
There are many examples of this. The major one being pollinators. The American
Honey_bee was introduced in the rainforest[which?] to pollinate fragmented
landscapes that native species cannot. Also, non-native species can function as
biocontrol agents to limit the effects of invasive species. Such as the use of
non-native species to control agricultural pests.[75]
Non-native species can have other benefits. Asian_oysters, for example, filter
water_pollutants better than native[clarification_needed] oysters. They also
grow faster and withstand disease better than natives. Biologists are currently
considering releasing this mollusk in the Chesapeake_Bay to help restore oyster
stocks and remove pollution. A recent study by the Johns_Hopkins_School_of
Public_Health found the Asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay's
deteriorating water quality.[76] Additionally, some species have invaded an
area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the
environment, a term referred to as naturalisation. For example, L._leucozonium,
shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in North
America,[77] has become an important pollinator of caneberry as well as
cucurbit, apple_trees, and blueberry bushes.[78]
** Invasivorism[edit] **
See also: List_of_edible_invasive_species
Invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts
the native eco-system. In response, Invasivorism is a movement that explores
the idea of eating invasive species in order to control, reduce, or eliminate
their populations. Chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using
invasive species as alternative ingredients.
In 2005 Chef Bun_Lai of Miya's Sushi in New_Haven,_Connecticut created the
first menu dedicated to the idea of using invasive species, during which time
half the menus invasive species offerings were conceptual because invasive
species were not yet commercially available. [79] Today, Miyaâs offers a
plethora of invasive species such as Chesapeake blue_catfish, Florida lionfish,
Kentucky silver_carp, Georgia cannonball_jellyfish, and invasive edible plants
such as Connecticut Japanese_knotweed and Autumn_olive. [80][81][82][83][84]
Joe_Roman, a Harvard and University_of_Vermont conservation biologist who is
the recipient of the Rachel_Carson Environmental award, is the editor and chief
of Eat The Invaders, a website dedicated to encouraging people to eat invasive
species as part of a solution to the problem.[85][86][87]
Skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new
placeâsuch as the Indo-Pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the
waters of the Western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf_of_Mexicoâeradication is
almost impossible. Critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the
unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely.[88]

Proponents of invasivorism argue that humans have the ability to eat away any
species that it has an appetite for, pointing to the many animals which humans
have been able to hunt to extinctionâsuch as the Dodo bird, the Caribbean
monk_seal, and the passenger_pigeon. Proponents of invasivorism also point to
the success that Jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of
lionfish by encouraging the consumption of the fish.[89]
In recent years, organizations including Reef Environmental Educational
Foundation[90] and the Institute for Applied Ecology, among others, have
published cookbooks and recipes that include invasive species as ingredients.
[91][92][93]
*** Costs[edit] ***
Economic_costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through
production loss in agriculture and forestry, and management costs. Estimated
damage and control cost of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more
than $138 billion annually.[94] Economic losses can also occur through loss of
recreational and tourism revenues.[95] When economic costs of invasions are
calculated as production loss and management costs, they are low because they
do not consider environmental damage; if monetary values were assigned to the
extinction of species, loss in biodiversity, and loss of ecosystem_services,
costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase.[94] The
following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact
of biological invasions.
It is often argued that the key to reducing the costs of invasive species
damage and management is early detection and rapid response,[96] meaning that
incurring an initial cost of searching for and finding an invasive species and
quickly controlling it, while the population is small, is less expensive that
managing the invasive population when it is widespread and already causing
damage. However, an intense search for the invader is only important to reduce
costs in cases where the invasive species is (1) not frequently reintroduced
into the managed area and (2) cost effective to search for and find.[97]
*** Plant industry[edit] ***
Weeds reduce yield in agriculture, though they may provide essential nutrients.
Some deep-rooted weeds can "mine" nutrients (see dynamic_accumulator) from the
subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil, while others provide habitat for
beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species. Many weed species are
accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material. Many
introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants, threaten young
cattle (e.g., leafy spurge, Euphorbia_esula) or are unpalatable because of
thorns and spines (e.g., yellow_starthistle). Forage loss from invasive weeds
on pastures amounts to nearly US$1 billion in the U.S. alone.[94] A decline in
pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by honey_bees
infected by the invasive varroa_mite. Introduced rats (Rattus_rattus and R.
norvegicus) have become serious pests on farms, destroying stored grains.[94]
Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also
suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock. Citrus greening is a bacterial
disease vectored by the invasive Asian_citrus_psyllid (ACP). Because of the
impacts of this disease on citrus crops, citrus is under quarantine and highly
regulated in areas where ACP has been found.[98]
*** Aquaculture[edit] ***
Aquaculture is a very common vector of species introductions â mainly of
species with economic potential (e.g., Oreochromis_niloticus).[99]
*** Forestry[edit] ***

Poster asking campers to not move firewood around, avoiding the spread of
invasive species.
The unintentional introduction of forest pest species and plant pathogens can
change forest_ecology and damage the timber_industry. Overall, forest
ecosystems in the U.S. are widely invaded by exotic pests, plants, and
pathogens.[100][101]
The Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora_glabripennis) was first introduced
into the U.S. in 1996, and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres
of hardwood trees. As of 2005 thirty million dollars had been spent in attempts
to eradicate this pest and protect millions of trees in the affected regions.
[94] The woolly_adelgid has inflicted damage on old-growth spruce, fir and
hemlock forests and damages the Christmas_tree industry.[102] And the chestnut
blight fungus (Cryphonectria_parasitica) and Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma
novo-ulmi) are two plant pathogens with serious impacts on these two species,
and forest health.[103] Garlic mustard, Alliaria_petiolata, is one of the most
problematic invasive plant species in eastern North American forests. The
characteristics of garlic mustard are slightly different from those of the
surrounding native plants, which results in a highly successful species that is
altering the composition and function of the native communities it invades.
When garlic mustard invades the understory of a forest, it affects the growth
rate of tree seedlings, which is likely to alter forest regeneration of impact
forest composition in the future.[104]
*** Tourism and recreation[edit] ***
Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation, such as fishing, hunting,
hiking, wildlife_viewing, and water-based activities. They can damage a wide
array of environmental services that are important to recreation, including,
but not limited to, water_quality and quantity, plant and animal diversity, and
species abundance.[105] Eiswerth states, "very little research has been
performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such
as regions, states, and watersheds". Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum
spicatum) in parts of the US, fill lakes with plants complicating fishing and
boating.[106] The very loud call of the introduced common_coqui depresses real
estate values in affected neighborhoods of Hawaii.[107]
**** Health[edit] ****
Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic
diseases such as HIV[94] to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g.
pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and tsetse_fly pests)
can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions. Throughout recorded
history, epidemics of human diseases, such as malaria, yellow_fever, typhus,
and bubonic_plague, spread via these vectors.[38] A recent example of an
introduced disease is the spread of the West_Nile_virus, which killed humans,
birds, mammals, and reptiles.[108] The introduced Chinese_mitten_crabs are
carriers of Asian_lung_fluke.[56] Waterborne disease agents, such as cholera
bacteria (Vibrio_cholerae), and causative agents of harmful_algal_blooms are
often transported via ballast water.[109] Invasive species and accompanying
control efforts can have long term public_health implications. For instance,
pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and
surface water.[94]
**** Biodiversity[edit] ****
Main article: Biodiversity
Biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global
biodiversity_loss and is increasing because of tourism and globalization.
[citation_needed] This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated fresh
water systems, though quarantines and ballast_water rules have improved the
situation.[110]
Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via competitive
exclusion, niche displacement, or hybridisation with related native species.
Therefore, besides their economic ramifications, alien invasions may result in
extensive changes in the structure, composition and global distribution of the
biota of sites of introduction, leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the
world's fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity.[111] Nevertheless, it is
difficult to unequivocally attribute extinctions to a species invasion, and the
few scientific studies that have done so have been with animal taxa. Concern
over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider
the actual evidence (either ecological or economic), in relation to the
potential risk.[112]

*** Genetic pollution[edit] ***
Main article: Genetic_pollution
Native species can be threatened with extinction[113] through the process of
genetic_pollution. Genetic pollution is unintentional hybridization and
introgression, which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes
as a result of either a numerical or fitness advantage of the introduced
species.[114] Genetic pollution occurs either through introduction or through
habitat modification, where previously isolated species are brought into
contact with the new genotypes. Invading species have been shown to adapt to
their new environments in a remarkably short amount of time.[115] The
population size of invading species may remain small for a number of years and
then experience an explosion in population, a phenomenon known as "the lag
effect".[116]
Hybrids resulting from invasive species interbreeding with native species can
incorporate their genotypes into the gene pool over time through introgression.
Similarly, in some instances a small invading population can threaten much
larger native populations. For example, Spartina_alterniflora was introduced in
the San Francisco Bay and hybridized with native Spartina_foliosa. The higher
pollen count and male fitness of the invading species resulted in introgression
that threatened the native populations due to lower pollen counts and lower
viability of the native species.[117] Reduction in fitness is not always
apparent from morphological observations alone. Some degree of gene_flow is
normal, and preserves constellations of genes and genotypes.[118][119] An
example of this is the interbreeding of migrating coyotes with the red_wolf, in
areas of eastern North_Carolina where the red_wolf was reintroduced.[120] The
end result was a decrease in stable breeding pairs of red wolf, which may
further complicate the social stability of packs and reintroduction efforts.
***** Invasive exotic diseases[edit] *****
History is rife with the spread of exotic diseases, such as the introduction of
smallpox into the indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas by the Spanish, where it
obliterated entire populations_of_indigenous_civilizations before they were
ever even seen by Europeans.
Problematic exotic disease introductions in the past century or so include the
chestnut_blight which has almost eliminated the American_chestnut tree from its
forest habitat. Responses to increase the population of the American chestnut
include creating blight resistant trees that can be reintroduced. This displays
both the positive and negative aspects of introduced species.
Another example is the Dutch_elm_disease, which has severely reduced the
American_elm trees in forests and cities.[citation_needed]
Diseases may also be vectored by invasive insects such as the Asian_citrus
psyllid and the bacterial disease citrus_greening.[121]
It has been argued that some invasive species "...could fill niches in degraded
ecosystems and help restore native biodiversity...".[122]

While the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of
biology, the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the
field of ecology and geography where the issue of biological invasions is
especially important. Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced
by Charles_Elton's 1958 book The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants
which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to
create a generalized picture of biological invasions.[123][124] Studies on
invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field
experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day.[124] This
research, which has largely consisted of field observational studies, has
disproportionately been concerned with terrestrial_plants.[124] The rapid
growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to
describe invasive species and events. Despite this, little standard terminology
exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official
designation but is commonly referred to as "Invasion ecology" or more generally
"Invasion biology".[123][124] This lack of standard terminology is a
significant problem, and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature
of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture,
zoology, and pathology, as well as due to studies on invasive species being
commonly performed in isolation of one another.[123]
In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous, subjective, and pejorative vocabulary
that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific
papers, Colautti and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on
biogeography rather than on taxa.[125]
By discarding taxonomy, human_health, and economic factors, this model focused
only on ecological factors. The model evaluated individual populations rather
than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that
environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced
species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as
harmful.
**** Introduced species on islands[edit] ****
Perhaps the best place to study problems associated with introduced species is
on islands. Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from
continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted
to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no
natural predator of an introduced species is present, and the non-native
spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied niche.
An additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become
flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions and
cannot readily escape the danger brought to them by introduced predators. The
tendency of rails in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making
them vulnerable has led to the disproportionate number of extinctions in that
family.
The field of island_restoration has developed as a field of conservation
biology and ecological_restoration, a large part of which deals with the
eradication of invasive species. A 2019 study suggests that if eradications of
invasive animals were conducted on just 169 islands the survival prospects of
9.4% of the Earthâs most highly threatened terrestrial insular vertebrates
would be improved.[126]
*** Hawaii[edit] ***
Main article: Invasive_species_in_Hawaii
The islands of Hawaii have many invasive species affecting the islands' native
plants and animals. Invasive insects, plants, hoofed animals such as deer,
goats and pigs endanger native plants, rosy_wolfsnails from Africa feed on the
island's native snails, and plants such as Australian_tree_fern and Miconia
calvescens shade out native plants. Populations of introduced little_fire_ants
in Hawaii can have major negative impacts on animals, crops, and humans. The
veiled_chameleon and the Jackson's_chameleon have a great impact on the ecology
of Hawaii.
*** New Zealand[edit] ***
Main article: Invasive_species_in_New_Zealand
The first invasive species were the dogs and rats brought by Polynesian
settlers around 1300.[127][128] Cats, brought later by Europeans, have had a
devastating effect upon the native birdlife, particularly as many New Zealand
birds are flightless. Rabbits, introduced as a food source by sailors in the
1800s, have become a severe nuisance to farmers, notably in the South_Island.
Common gorse, originally a hedge plant in Britain, was introduced to New
Zealand for the same purpose but grows aggressively and threatens to obliterate
native plants in much of the country and is hence routinely eradicated.
The native forests are heavily impacted by several species of deer from North
America and Europe and the Australian brushtail_possum. These exotic species
have all thrived in the New Zealand environment.
*** South Georgia Island[edit] ***
In 2018, the South_Georgia_Island was declared free of invasive rodents after a
multi-year extermination effort.[129][130]
