Art Nouveau (/ËÉËrt_nuËËvoÊ,_ËÉËr/; French: [aÊ_nuvo]) is an
international style of art, architecture and applied_art, especially the
decorative_arts. It was most popular between 1890 and 1910.[1] It was a
reaction to the academic_art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century
architecture and decoration. It was inspired by natural forms and structures,
particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers, and whiplash forms. Other
defining characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement,
often given by asymmetry and by curving lines, and the use of modern materials,
such as iron pillars, sculpted and curved in naturalistic designs.[2]
One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional
distinction between fine arts (especially painting and sculpture), and applied
arts. It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture,
glass art, textiles, ceramics, jewelry and metal work. The style responded to
leading nineteenth-century theoreticians, such as French architect EugÃ¨ne-
Emmanuel_Viollet-le-Duc (1814â1879) and British art critic John_Ruskin
(1819â1900). In Britain, it was influenced by William_Morris and the Arts_and
Crafts_movement, which sought synthesis of art and craft. German architects and
designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk (âtotal work of
artâ) that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior
in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.[3]
The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in
1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul
Hankar, Henry_Van_de_Velde, and especially Victor_Horta, whose HÃ´tel_Tassel in
Brussels was completed in 1893.[4][5][6] It moved quickly to Paris, where it
was adapted by Hector_Guimard, who saw Horta's work in Brussels and applied the
style for the entrances of the new Paris_Metro. It reached its peak at the 1900
Paris_International_Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of
artists such as Louis_Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of
Alphonse_Mucha, and the glassware of RenÃ©_Lalique and Ãmile_GallÃ©.
From Belgium and France it spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different
names and characteristics in each country. It often appeared not in capital
cities, but in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic
identities â Turin in Italy, Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in
Germany; Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; and Barcelona in
Spain. In each country where it appeared, Art Nouveau took on its own
distinctive characteristics, and, usually, its own name: it was called
Modernisme in Barcelona, and Secession in Vienna, where it featured the work of
architects including Otto_Wagner, Joseph_Maria_Olbrich, and Josef_Hoffmann. In
the United States it was sometimes known as the Tiffany Style for the glass of
Louis_Tiffany.[7][8]
By 1910, Art Nouveau's influence had faded. It was replaced as the dominant
European architectural and decorative style first by Art_Deco and then by
Modernism.[9][10]

***** Naming[edit] *****
The term art nouveau was first used first in the 1880s in the Belgian journal
LâArt Moderne to describe the work of Les Vingt, twenty painters and
sculptors seeking reform through art. The name was popularized by the Maison de
l'Art Nouveau (House of the New Art), an art gallery opened in Paris in 1895 by
the Franco-German art_dealer Siegfried_Bing. In France, Art Nouveau was also
sometimes called by the British term "Modern Style", due to its roots in the
Arts_and_Crafts_movement, Style moderne, or Style 1900.[11] It was also
sometimes called Style Jules Verne, Le Style MÃ©tro (after Hector Guimard's
iron and glass subway entrances), Art Belle Ãpoque, and Art fin de siÃ¨cle.
[12]
English uses the French name Art Nouveau (new art). The style is related to,
but not identical with, styles that emerged in many countries in Europe at
about the same time. Their local names were often used in their respective
countries to describe the whole movement.
    * In Belgium, where the architectural movement began, along with Art
      Nouveau it was sometimes termed ' or Style coup de fouet (whiplash
      style), or "noodle style" by its detractors.[12]
    * In Britain, it was known as the Modern Style, or, because of works of
      Glasgow_School, as the "Glasgow"_style. It is known as Modern
      (ÐÐ¾Ð´ÐµÑÐ½) in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine, Modernas in
      Lithuania after that,
    * In Germany and Scandinavia, a related style was called Jugendstil, after
      the popular German art magazine of that name.[12]. It is now called
      Jugend in Finland and Sweden, Juugend in Estonia, JÅ«gendstils in Latvia.
      In Denmark it is also known as SkÃ¸nvirke, in Germany - also as
      Reformstil,
    * In Austria and the neighbouring countries then part of the Austro-
      Hungarian_Empire, a similar style emerged, called Secessionsstil in
      German after the artists of the Vienna_Secession (Hungarian: szecessziÃ³,
      Czech: secese, Slovak: secesia, Polish: secesja) or Wiener Jugendstil,
    * In Italy, because of the popularity of designs from London's Liberty_&_Co
      department store (mostly designed by Archibald_Knox), it was often called
      Stile Liberty ("Liberty style"), Stile floreale, or Arte nuova (New Art),
    * In the United_States, due to its association with Louis_Comfort_Tiffany,
      it was often called the "Tiffany style".[10][11]
    * In the Netherlands it was called Nieuwe Kunst (new art)[10][11], in
      Portugal - Arte nova (both meaning new art).
    * In Spain, the related style was known as Modernismo, Modernisme (in
      Catalan) and Arte joven ("young art").
Some names refer specifically to the organic forms that were popular with the
Art Nouveau artists: Stile Floreal ("floral style") in France; Paling Stijl
("eel style") in Belgium,[13][14] Style Sapin (fir-tree style) in Switzerland
and Wellenstil ("wave style") and Lilienstil ("lily style") in Germany.[11]
***** History[edit] *****

**** Influences[edit] ****
    * The Red_House by William_Morris and Philip_Webb (1859)
    * Japanese woodblock print by Utagawa_Kunisada (1850s)
    * The_Peacock_Room by James_McNeil_Whistler (1876â1877)
    * William_Morris printed textile design (1883)
    * Swan, rush and iris wallpaper design by Walter_Crane (1883)
The new art movement had its roots in Britain, in the floral designs of William
Morris, and in the Arts_and_Crafts_movement founded by the pupils of Morris.
Early prototypes of the style include the Red House of Morris (1859), and the
lavish Peacock_Room by James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler. The new movement was also
strongly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite painters, including Dante_Gabriel
Rossetti and Edward_Burne-Jones, and especially by British graphic artists of
the 1880s, including Selwyn_Image, Heywood_Sumner, Walter_Crane, Alfred
Gilbert, and especially Aubrey_Beardsley.[15]
In France, it was influenced by the architectural theorist and historian
EugÃ¨ne_Viollet-le-Duc, a declared enemy of the historical Beaux-Arts
architectural_style. In his 1872 book Entretiens sur l'architecture, he wrote,
"Use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening
traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate
a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form
and its ornament."[16] This book influenced a generation of architects,
including Louis_Sullivan, Victor_Horta, Hector_Guimard, and Antoni_GaudÃ­.[17]
The French painters Maurice_Denis, Pierre_Bonnard and Ãdouard_Vuillard played
an important part in integrating fine arts painting with decoration. "I believe
that before everything a painting must decorate", Denis wrote in 1891. "The
choice of subjects or scenes is nothing. It is by the value of tones, the
coloured surface and the harmony of lines that I can reach the spirit and wake
up the emotions."[18] These painters all did both traditional painting and
decorative painting on screens, in glass, and in other media.[19]
Another important influence on the new style was Japonism. This was a wave of
enthusiasm for Japanese woodblock_printing, particularly the works of
Hiroshige, Hokusai, and Utagawa_Kunisada, which were imported into Europe
beginning in the 1870s. The enterprising Siegfried_Bing founded a monthly
journal, Le Japon artistique in 1888, and published thirty-six issues before it
ended in 1891. It influenced both collectors and artists, including Gustav
Klimt. The stylized features of Japanese prints appeared in Art Nouveau
graphics, porcelain, jewellery, and furniture.
New technologies in printing and publishing allowed Art Nouveau to quickly
reach a global audience. Art magazines, illustrated with photographs and colour
lithographs, played an essential role in popularizing the new style. The_Studio
in England, Arts et idÃ¨es and Art et dÃ©coration in France, and Jugend in
Germany allowed the style to spread rapidly to all corners of Europe. Aubrey
Beardsley in England, and EugÃ¨ne_Grasset, Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec, and
FÃ©lix_Vallotton achieved international recognition as illustrators.[20] With
the posters by Jules_Cheret for dancer Loie_Fuller in 1893, and by Alphonse
Mucha for actress Sarah_Bernhardt in 1895, the poster became not just
advertising, but an art form. Sarah Bernhardt set aside large numbers of her
posters for sale to collectors.[21]
**** Origins of Art Nouveau â Brussels (1893â1898)[edit] ****
    * Hankar House by Paul_Hankar (1893)
    * Stairway of HÃ´tel_Tassel by Victor_Horta (1892-1893)
    * Bloemenwerf house in Brussels, by Henry_Van_de_Velde (1896)
    * Bloemenwerf chair made by Henry_Van_de_Velde for his residence (1895)
    * Poster for the International_Exposition by Henri_Privat-Livemont (1897)
The first Art Nouveau houses, Hankar_House [fr] by Paul_Hankar (1893) and the
HÃ´tel_Tassel by Victor_Horta (1892-1893),[5][4] appeared almost simultaneously
in Brussels. Hankar was particularly inspired by the theories of the French
architect EugÃ¨ne_Viollet-le-Duc. With a goal to create a synthesis of fine
arts and decorative arts, he brought Adolphe_Crespin [fr] and Albert
Ciamberlani [fr] to decorate the interior and exterior with sgraffites, or
murals. Hankar decorated stores, restaurants and galleries in what a local
critic called "a veritable delirium of originality". He died in 1901 just as
the movement was beginning to receive recognition.[22]
Victor_Horta was among the most influential architects of the early Art
Nouveau, and his HÃ´tel_Tassel (1892-93) is one of the style's landmarks.[23]
[24] Horta, an architect with classical training, designed the residence of a
prominent Belgian chemist, Ãmile Tassel, on a very narrow and deep site. The
central element of the house was the stairway, not enclosed by walls, decorated
with a curling wrought-iron railing, and placed beneath a high skylight. The
floors were supported by slender iron columns like the trunks of trees. The
mosaic floors and walls were decorated with delicate arabesques in floral and
vegetal forms, which became the most popular signature of Art Nouveau.[25] In a
short period Horta built three more town houses in the new style; the HÃ´tel
Solvay, HÃ´tel_van_Eetvelde, and Maison_&_Atelier_Horta. All four are now
UNESCO_World_Heritage_Sites.
Henry_Van_de_Velde, born in Antwerp, was another central figure in the birth of
Art Nouveau. His architecture included his residence, the Bloemenwerf (1893-96)
[26][27] influenced by the Red House of work of William_Morris. Van de Velde,
like Horta, designed not just the house, but also the interior decoration.
Trained as a painter, he became one of the first Art Nouveau designers,
creating textiles, wallpaper, silverware, jewellery, and even clothing that
matched the style of the residence. He was also an early theorist of the Art
Nouveau style, demanding the use use of dynamic, often opposing lines. Van de
Velde wrote: "A line is a force like all the other elementary forces. Several
lines put together but opposed have a presence as strong as several forces". He
found it difficult to compete with Victor Horta, and the two men disliked each
other. Van de Velde moved to Germany, where he founded Grand-Ducal School of
Arts and Crafts in Weimar and then played an important role in the German
Werkbund.
The debut of Art Nouveau architecture in Brussels was accompanied by a wave of
Decorative Art in the new style. Important artists included Gustave_Strauven,
who used wrought iron to achieve baroque effects on Brussels facades; the
furniture designer Gustave_Serrurier-Bovy, known for his highly original chairs
and articulated metal furniture; and the jewellery designer Philippe_Wolfers,
who made jewellery in the form of dragonflies, butterflies, swans and serpents.
[28]
The Brussels_International_Exposition held in 1897 brought international
attention to the style; Horta, Hankar, Van de Velde, Serrurier-Bovy took part
in the design of the fair, Henri_Privat-Livemont created the poster for the
exhibition.
The style was quickly noticed in neighbouring France. After visiting Horta's
HÃ´tel Tassel, Hector_Guimard built the Castel_BÃ©ranger, among the first Paris
buildings in the new style, between 1895 and 1898.[nb_1] Parisians had been
complaining of the monotony of the architecture of the boulevards built under
Napoleon_III by Georges-EugÃ¨ne_Haussmann. They welcomed Guimard's colourful
and picturesque style; the Castel BÃ©ranger was chosen as one of the best new
faÃ§ades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. Guimard was given the commission
to design the entrances for the new Paris_MÃ©tro system, which brought the
style to the attention of the millions of visitors to the city's 1900
Exposition_Universelle.[12]
**** Paris - Maison de l'Art Nouveau (1895)[edit] ****
    * Siegfried_Bing invited artists to show modern works in his new Maison de
      l'Art Nouveau (1895).
    * The Maison de l'Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing (1895)
    * Poster by FÃ©lix_Vallotton for the new Maison de l'Art Nouveau (1896)
    * Gateway of the Castel_BÃ©ranger by Hector_Guimard (1895â1898)
The Franco-German art dealer and publisher Siegfried_Bing played a key role in
publicizing the style. In 1891, he founded a magazine devoted to the art of
Japan, which helped publicize Japonism in Europe. In 1892, he organized an
exhibit of seven artists, among them Pierre_Bonnard, FÃ©lix_Vallotton, Ãdouard
Vuillard, Toulouse-Lautrec and EugÃ¨ne_Grasset, which included both modern
painting and decorative work. This exhibition was shown at the SociÃ©tÃ©
nationale_des_beaux-arts in 1895. In the same year, Bing opened a new gallery
at 22_rue_de_Provence in Paris, the Maison_de_l'Art_Nouveau, devoted to new
works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the
gallery were designed by the Belgian architect Henry_Van_de_Velde, one of the
pioneers of Art Nouveau architecture. The Maison de l'Art Nouveau showed
paintings by Georges_Seurat, Paul_Signac and Toulouse-Lautrec, glass from Louis
Comfort_Tiffany and Emile_GallÃ©, jewellery by RenÃ©_Lalique, and posters by
Aubrey_Beardsley. The works shown there were not at all uniform in style. Bing
wrote in 1902, "Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any
way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a
house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient
to show the modernity of their tendencies."[30]
**** Paris Exposition Universelle (1900)[edit] ****
    * Main entrance to the Paris 1900_Exposition_Universelle
    * The Bigot Pavilion, showcasing the work of ceramics artist Alexandre
      Bigot
    * Entrance to the Austrian exhibit
    * The German Pavilion by Bruno_MÃ¶hring
    * Paris metro station entrance at Abbesses designed by Hector_Guimard for
      the 1900 Exposition universelle
The Paris 1900 Exposition_universelle marked the high point of Art Nouveau.
Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors
from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware,
furniture and decorative objects of the style. The architecture of the
Exposition was often a mixture of Art Nouveau and Beaux-Arts_architecture: the
main exhibit hall, the Grand_Palais had a Beaux-Arts faÃ§ade completely
unrelated to the spectacular Art Nouveau stairway and exhibit hall in the
interior.
French designers all made special works for the Exhibition: Lalique crystal and
jewellery; jewellery by Henri_Vever and Georges_Fouquet; Daum glass; the
Manufacture_nationale_de_SÃ¨vres in porcelain; ceramics by Alexandre_Bigot;
sculpted glass lamps and vases by Emile_GallÃ©; furniture by Ãdouard_Colonna
and Louis_Majorelle; and many other prominent arts and crafts firms. At the
1900 Paris Exposition, Siegfried_Bing presented a pavilion called Art Nouveau
Bing, which featured six different interiors entirely decorated in the Style.
[31][32]
The Exposition was the first international showcase for Art Nouveau designers
and artists from across Europe and beyond. Prize winners and participants
included Alphonse_Mucha, who decorated the pavilion of Bosnia-Herzegovina; the
decorators and designers Bruno_Paul and Bruno_MÃ¶hring from Berlin; Carlo
Bugatti from Turin; Bernhardt Pankok from Bavaria; and Louis_Comfort_Tiffany
and Company from the United States.[33] The Viennese architect Otto_Wagner was
a member of the jury, and presented a model of the Art Nouveau bathroom of his
own town apartment in Vienna, featuring a glass bathtub.[34]
While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much
to popularize the style. The 1888_Barcelona_Universal_Exposition marked the
beginning of the Modernisme style in Spain, with some buildings of LluÃ­s
DomÃ¨nech_i_Montaner. The Esposizione_internazionale_d'arte_decorativa_moderna
of 1902 in Turin, Italy, showcased designers from across Europe, including
Victor_Horta from Belgium and Joseph_Maria_Olbrich from Vienna, along with
local artists such as Carlo_Bugatti, Galileo_Chini. and Eugenio_Quarti. [35]
***** Local variations[edit] *****
**** Art Nouveau in France[edit] ****
    * Le_Train_bleu at the Gare_de_Lyon (1900)
    * Doorway of the Lavirotte_Building by Jules_Lavirotte, 29 avenue Rapp,
      Paris (1901)
    * Cupola of the headquarters of SociÃ©tÃ©_gÃ©nÃ©rale at 29 boulevard
      Haussmann, by Jacques_Hermant (1905â11)
    * Poster by Theophile-Alexandre_Steinlen for the cabaret Le_Chat_noir
      (1896)
    * The Villa_Majorelle in Nancy by Henri_Sauvage (1901â02)
    * The jewellery shop of Georges_Fouquet at 6 rue Royale, Paris, designed by
      Alphonse_Mucha, now in the Carnavalet_Museum (1901)
Following the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most
extravagant residences in the style were built by Jules_Lavirotte, who entirely
covered the faÃ§ades with ceramic sculptural decoration. The most flamboyant
example is the Lavirotte_Building, at 29 avenue Rapp (1901). Office buildings
and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass
cupolas and ceramic decoration. The style was particularly popular in
restaurants and cafÃ©s, including Maxim's at 3_rue_Royale, and Le_Train_bleu at
the Gare_de_Lyon (1900).[36]
The status of Paris attracted foreign artists to the city. The Swiss-born
artist EugÃ¨ne_Grasset was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau
posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret Le_Chat_noir in 1885, made his
first posters for the FÃªtes de Paris and a celebrated poster of Sarah
Bernhardt in 1890. In Paris, he taught at the GuÃ©rin school of art (Ãcole
normale d'enseignement du dessin), where his students included Augusto
Giacometti and Paul_Berthon.[37][38] Swiss-born Theophile-Alexandre_Steinlen
created the famous poster for the Paris cabaret Le_Chat_noir in 1896. The Czech
artist Alphonse_Mucha (1860â1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made
a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play Gismonda by Victorien_Sardou
in ThÃ©Ã¢tre_de_la_Renaissance. The success of this poster led to a contract to
produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt.
The city of Nancy in Lorraine became the other French capital of the new style.
In 1901, the Alliance provinciale des industries d'art, also known as the
Ãcole_de_Nancy, was founded, dedicated to upsetting the hierarchy that put
painting and sculpture above the decorative arts. The major artists working
there included the glass vase and lamp creators Emile_GallÃ©, the Daum brothers
in glass design, and the designer Louis_Majorelle, who created furniture with
graceful floral and vegetal forms. The architect Henri_Sauvage brought the new
architectural style to Nancy with his Villa_Majorelle in 1902.
The French style was widely propagated by new magazines, including The Studio,
Arts et IdÃ©es and Art et DÃ©coration, whose photographs and colour lithographs
made the style known to designers and wealthy clients around the world.
In France, the style reached its summit in 1900, and thereafter slipped rapidly
out of fashion, virtually disappearing from France by 1905. Art Nouveau was a
luxury style, which required expert and highly-paid craftsmen, and could not be
easily or cheaply mass-produced. One of the few Art Nouveau products that could
be mass produced was the perfume bottle, and these are still manufactured in
the style today.
**** Art Nouveau in Belgium and the Netherlands[edit] ****
    * The house of architect Paul Cauchie (1905) featuring sgraffito, Brusells
    * Chair by Henry_Van_De_Velde (1896)
    * Bed and mirror by Gustave_Serrurier-Bovy (1898â99), now in the MusÃ©e
      d'Orsay, Paris
    * Philippe_Wolfers, Plume de Paon, (Collection King Baudouin Foundation,
      depot: KMKG-MRAH)
    * Metal work of Gustave_Strauven at Maison Saint-Cyr (1903), Brusells
    * Detail of the Astoria (1904-1905) in Amsterdam
Belgium was an early centre of the Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the
architecture of Victor_Horta, who designed one of the first Art Nouveau houses,
the HÃ´tel_Tassel in 1893. Horta met and had a strong influence on the work of
the young Hector_Guimard and Gustave_Strauven who was Horta's disciple and
started his own practice at 21. Important artists included another Art Nouveau
pioneer architect Paul_Hankar and Adolphe_Crespin [fr] whose sgraffiti are at
many Hankar's buildings; the architect and furniture designer Henry_Van_De
Velde, the decorator Gustave_Serrurier-Bovy, and the graphic artist Fernand
Khnopff.[39][5][40] Belgian designers took advantage of an abundant supply of
ivory imported from the Belgian_Congo; mixed sculptures, combining stone, metal
and ivory, by such artists as Philippe_Wolfers, was popular.[41]
In the Netherlands, the style was known as the Nieuwe Kunst (the "New Art" in
Dutch). Prominent building include American_Hotel (1898-1900), Beurs_van
Berlage (1896-1903) by Hendrik_Petrus_Berlage, and Astoria (1904-1905) by
Herman_Hendrik_Baanders and Gerrit_van_Arkel in Amsterdam; the railway_station
in Haarlem (1906-1908), the_office_building of the Holland_America_Lines (1917)
in Rotterdam. Artists of the style included Carel_Adolph_Lion_Cachet, Theo
Nieuwenhuis and Gerrit_Willem_Dijsselhof, who designed in a more picturesque
and decorative style. Furniture design was influenced by the importation of
exotic woods from the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), while textiles were
influenced by the designs and techniques of batik.[41]
**** Modern Style and Glasgow School in Britain[edit] ****
    * Cover design by Arthur_Mackmurdo for a book on Christopher_Wren (1883)
    * Willow_Tearooms by Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh, in Kelvingrove, Glasgow
      (1903)
    * Belt buckle by Archibald_Knox for Liberty_Department_Store
    * Embroidered panels by Margaret_Macdonald_Mackintosh (1902)
Art Nouveau had its roots in Britain, in the arts_and_crafts_movement of the
1880s, which called for a closer union between the fine arts and decorative
arts, and a break away from historical styles to designs inspired by function
and nature. One notable early example is Arthur_Mackmurdo's design for the
cover of his essay on the city churches of Sir_Christopher_Wren, published in
1883.
Other important innovators in Britain included the graphic designers Aubrey
Beardsley whose drawings featured the curved lines that became the most
recognizable feature of the style. free-flowing wrought_iron from the 1880s
could also be adduced, or some flat floral textile designs, most of which owed
some impetus to patterns of 19th century design. Other British graphic artists
who had an important place in the style included Walter_Crane and Charles
Ashbee.[42]
The Liberty department store in London played an important role, through its
colourful stylized floral designs for textiles, and the silver, pewter, and
jewellery designs of Manxman (of Scottish descent) Archibald_Knox. His
jewellery designs in materials and forms broke away entirely from the
historical traditions of jewellery design.
For Art Nouveau architecture and furniture design, the most important centre in
Britain was Glasgow, with the creations of Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh and the
Glasgow_School, whose work was inspired by the French Art Nouveau, Japanese
art, symbolism and Gothic revival. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his
designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs
particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His architectural
creations included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the
Glasgow_School_of_Art (1897). He also established a major reputation as a
furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, Margaret
Macdonald_Mackintosh, a prominent painter and designer. Together they created
striking designs that combined geometric straight lines with gently curving
floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the Glasgow
Rose".[43]
LÃ©on-Victor_Solon, made an important contribution to Art Nouveau ceramics as
art director at Mintons. He specialised in plaques and in tube-lined vases
marketed as "secessionist ware" (usually described as named after the Viennese
art_movement).[44] Apart from ceramics, he designed textiles for the Leek_silk
industry[45] and doublures for a bookbinder (G.T.Bagguley of Newcastle under
Lyme), who patented the Sutherland binding in 1895.
The Edward Everard building in Bristol, built during 1900â01 to house the
printing_works_of_Edward_Everard, features an Art Nouveau faÃ§ade. The figures
depicted are of Johannes_Gutenberg and William_Morris, both eminent in the
field of printing. A winged figure symbolises the "Spirit of Light", while a
figure holding a lamp and mirror symbolises light and truth.
**** Jugendstil in Germany[edit] ****
    * Cover of Pan magazine by Joseph_Sattler (1895)
    * Cover of Jugend by Otto_Eckmann (1896)
    * Tapestry The Five Swans by Otto_Eckmann (1896â97)

    * Chair by Richard_Riemerschmid (1902)
    * Stoneware jug by Richard_Riemerschmid (1902)
German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, Jugendstil. The name
is taken from the artistic journal, Die_Jugend, which was published in Munich
and espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by Georg_Hirth
(Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine survived until
1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a
result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the
style: Jugendstil ("youth style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the
word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts,[46]
especially the forms of organic typography and graphic_design found in and
influenced by German magazines like Jugend, Pan, and Simplicissimus, it is now
applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany,
the Netherlands, the Baltic_states, and Nordic_countries.[10][47]
Earlier in 1892 Georg_Hirth coined the word "secession" that the Association of
Visual Artists of Munich used in their new name: Munich_Secession. Along with
better-known Vienna_Secession, Berlin_Secession group was also found in 1898.
Along with Jugend, two other journals, Simplicissimus, published in Munich, and
Pan, published in Berlin, proved important proponents of the Jugendstil. The
magazines were important for spreading the visual idiom of Jugendstil,
especially the graphical qualities. Jugendstil art includes a variety of
different methods, applied by the various individual artists and features the
use of hard lines as well as sinuous curves. Methods range from classic to
romantic. One feature of Jugendstil is the typography used, the letter and
image combination of which is unmistakable. The combination was used for covers
of novels, advertisements, and exhibition posters. Designers often used unique
display typefaces that worked harmoniously with the image.
One of the most famous German artists associated with both Die Jugend and Pan
was Otto_Eckmann. His favourite animal was the swan, and such was his influence
in the German movement that the swan came to serve as the leitmotif for the
Jugendstil. Another prominent designer in the style was Richard_Riemerschmid,
who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric
style that pointed forward toward Art Deco.[48]
The characterizing motif of whiplash (coup de fouet) curves was presented by
Hermann_Obrist in his embroidered wall hanging called "Cyclamen".
    * Ernst Ludwig House by Joseph_Maria_Olbrich (1900) now hosting Darmstadt
      Colony Museum
    * Wedding tower in Darmstadt Artistsâ Colony (1908)
    * Spa complex Sprudelhof in Bad Nauheim (1905-1911)
    * Mexikoplatz_station in Berlin (1902-1904)
    * Hackesche_HÃ¶fe in Berlin (1906)
The Darmstadt Artistsâ Colony was founded in 1899 by Ernest_Ludwig,_Grand
Duke_of_Hesse. The architect who built Grand Duke's house, as well as the
largest structure of the colony (Wedding tower), was Joseph_Maria_Olbrich, one
of the Vienna_Secession founders. Other notable artists of the colony were
Peter_Behrens and Hans_Christiansen. Ernest Ludwig also commissioned to rebuild
Bad_Nauheim spa complex at the beginning of XX century. A completely new
Sprudelhof [de] complex was constructed in 1905-1911 under the inspection of
Wilhelm_Jost [de] and attained one of the main objectives of Jugendstil: a
synthesis of all the arts[49]. Another member of the reigning family who
commissioned an Art Nouveau structure was Princess_Elisabeth_of_Hesse_and_by
Rhine. She founded Marfo-Mariinsky_Convent in Moscow in 1908 and its katholikon
is recognized as an Art Nouveau masterpiece.[50]
Another notable union in German Empire was the Deutscher_Werkbund, founded in
1907 in Munich at the instigation of Hermann_Muthesius by artists of Darmstadt
Colony Joseph_Maria_Olbrich, Peter_Behrens; by another founder of Vienna
Secession Josef_Hoffmann and Wiener_WerkstÃ¤tte founed by him, as well as by
Richard_Riemerschmid, Bruno_Paul and other artists and companies[51]. Later
Belgian Henry_Van_de_Velde joined the movement[nb_2]. The Grand-Ducal_School_of
Arts_and_Crafts [de], founded by him in Weimar, was a predecessor of Bauhaus,
one of the most influential currents in Modernist_architecture.[53]
In Berlin Jugendstil was chosen for the construction of several railway
stations. The most notable[54] is BÃ¼lowstraÃe by Bruno_MÃ¶hring (1900-1902),
other examples are Mexikoplatz (1902-1904), Botanischer_Garten (1908-1909),
Frohnau (1908-1910), Wittenbergplatz (1911-1913) and Pankow (1912-1914)
stations. Another notable structure of Berlin is Hackesche_HÃ¶fe (1906)
distinctive by use of polychrome glazed brick for courtyard facade.
**** Vienna Secession in Austria[edit] ****
Main article: Vienna_Secession
    * The Secession_Hall in Vienna by Joseph_Maria_Olbrich (1897)
    * Vampire in Ver_Sacrum #12 (1899) p.8 by Ernst_StÃ¶hr
    * Woman in a Yellow Dress by Max_Kurzweil (1899)
    * Armchair by Koloman_Moser
    * The Kiss by Gustav_Klimt (1907â08)
Vienna became the centre of a distinct variant of Art Nouveau, which became
known as the Vienna_Secession, an art movement that derived its name from
Munich_Secession established in 1892. Vienna Secession was founded in April
1897 by a group of artists that included Gustav_Klimt, Koloman_Moser, Josef
Hoffmann, Joseph_Maria_Olbrich, Max_Kurzweil, Ernst_StÃ¶hr, and others. The
painter Klimt became the president of the group. They objected to the
conservative orientation toward historicism expressed by Vienna_KÃ¼nstlerhaus,
the official union of artists. The Secession founded a magazine, Ver_Sacrum, to
promote their works in all media. The Secession style was notably more
feminine, less heavy and less nationalist than the Jugendstil in neighbouring
Germany.[55] The architect Joseph Olbrich designed the domed Secession building
in the new style, which became a showcase for the paintings of Gustav Klimt and
other Secession artists.
Klimt became the best-known of the Secession painters, often erasing the border
between fine art painting and decorative painting. Koloman_Moser was an
extremely versatile artist in the style; his work including magazine
illustrations, architecture, silverware, ceramics, porcelain, textiles, stained
glass windows, and furniture.
    * Detail of Majolica_House by Otto_Wagner (1898)
    * Karlsplatz_Stadtbahn_Station by Otto_Wagner (1899)
    * Stained glass by Koloman_Moser in Kirche_am_Steinhof (1904-1907)
    * The Palais_Stoclet in Brussels by Josef_Hoffmann (1905â1911)
The most prominent architect of the Vienna_Secession was Otto_Wagner[56], he
joined the movement soon after its inception to follow his students Hoffmann
and Olbrich. His major projects included stations of the urban rail network
(the Stadtbahn), the complex_at_Linke_Wienzeile [de] (consisting of Majolica
House, the House of Medallions and the house at KÃ¶stlergasse), and the
Steinhof_Psychiatric_Hospital [de], now called by his name. The stations now
serve as exhibition halls of the Vienna_Museum, and the largest structure of
the Steinhof Psychiatric hospital is Kirche_am_Steinhof (1904-1907).
In 1899 Joseph_Maria_Olbrich moved to Darmstadt_Artists'_Colony, in 1903
Koloman_Moser and Josef_Hoffmann founded the Wiener_WerkstÃ¤tte, a training
school and workshop for designers and craftsmen of furniture, carpets, textiles
and decorative objects.[57] In 1905 Koloman_Moser and Gustav_Klimt separated
from Vienna Secession, later in 1907 Koloman_Moser left Wiener_WerkstÃ¤tte as
well, while its other founder Josef_Hoffmann joined the Deutscher_Werkbund[51].
Gustav_Klimt and Josef_Hoffmann continued collaborating, they organized
Kunstschau_Exhibition [de] in 1908 in Vienna and built the Stoclet_Palace in
Brussels (1905-1911) that announced the arrival of Art_Deco and modernist
architecture[58][59] and was designated as a World_Heritage_Site by UNESCO in
June 2009.[60]
**** SzecessziÃ³ in the Kingdom of Hungary[edit] ****
    * Museum_of_Applied_Arts in Budapest by ÃdÃ¶n_Lechner (1893-1896)
    * Subotica_Synagogue, present-day Serbia by Marcell_Komor [hu] and DezsÅ
      Jakab [hu] (1902)[61]
    * ReÃ¶k_Palace in Szeged by Ede_Magyar (1907)
    * Australia house in Budapest Zoo by KÃ¡roly_KÃ³s and DezsÅ_Zrumeczky [hu]
      (1909-1912)
The pioneer and prophet of the SzecessziÃ³ (Secession in Hungarian), the
architect ÃdÃ¶n_Lechner created masterpieces that signified a transition from
historicism to modernism for Hungarian architecture.[62] His idea for a
Hungarian architectural style was the use of architectural ceramics and
oriental motifs. In his works, he used pygorganite placed in production by 1886
by Zsolnay_Porcelain_Manufactory.[62] This material was used in the
construction of notable Hungarian buildings of other styles, e.g. Hungarian
Parliament_Building and Matthias_Church.
Works by ÃdÃ¶n Lechner[63] include the Museum_of_Applied_Arts (1893-1896),
other building with similar distinctive features are Geological_Museum (1896-
1899) and The Postal Savings Bank building (1899-1902), all in Budapest.
However, due to the opposition of Hungarian architectural establishment to
Lechner's success, he soon was unable to get new commissions comparable to his
earlier buildings.[62] But Lechner was an inspiration and a master to the
following generation of architects who played the main role in popularising the
new style.[62] Within the process of Magyarization numerous buildings were
commissioned to his disciples in outskirts of the kingdom: e.g. Marcell_Komor 
[hu] and DezsÅ_Jakab [hu] were commissioned to build the Synagogue
(1901â1903) and Town Hall (1908-1910) in Szabadka (now Subotica, Serbia),
County Prefecture (1905-1907) and Palace_of_Culture (1911-1913) in
MarosvÃ¡sÃ¡rhely (now TÃ¢rgu_MureÈ, Romania). Later Lechner himself built the
Blue_Church in Pozsony (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) in 1909-1913.
Another important architect was KÃ¡roly_KÃ³s who was a follower of John_Ruskin
and William_Morris. KÃ³s took the Finnish National_Romanticism movement as a
model and the Transylvanian vernacular as the inspiration.[64] His most notable
buildings include the Roman Catholic Church in ZebegÃ©ny (1908-09), pavilions
for the Budapest Municipal Zoo (1909-1912) and the SzÃ©kely National Museum in
SepsiszentgyÃ¶rgy (now SfÃ¢ntu_Gheorghe, Romania, 1911-12).
    * Paintings in the church in ZebegÃ©ny (1908-09) by AladÃ¡r_KÃ¶rÃ¶sfÅi-
      Kriesch
    * Stained glass by SÃ¡ndor_Nagy [hu]
    * Mosaic by Miksa_RÃ³th at TÃ¶rÃ¶k_Bank [fr] building in Budapest (1906)
    * Relief at the facade of Gresham_Palace by GÃ©za_MarÃ³ti in Budapest
      (1906)
    * Cabinet by ÃdÃ¶n FaragÃ³, from Budapest (1901)
The movement that promoted SzecessziÃ³ in arts was GÃ¶dÃ¶llÅ Art Colony,
founded by AladÃ¡r_KÃ¶rÃ¶sfÅi-Kriesch, also a follower John_Ruskin and William
Morris and a professor at the Royal School of Applied Arts in Budapest in 1901.
[65] Its artists took part in many projects: painted Franz_Liszt_Academy_of
Music, the Church in ZebegÃ©ny (1908-09), created stained glass and mosaics for
Palace_of_Culture (1911-1913) in MarosvÃ¡sÃ¡rhely (now TÃ¢rgu_MureÈ, Romania).
[66]
An associate to GÃ¶dÃ¶llÅ Art Colony,[67] Miksa_RÃ³th was also involved in
several dozens of SzecessziÃ³ projects, including Budapest masterpieces like
Gresham_Palace (stained glass, 1907) and TÃ¶rÃ¶k_Bank [fr] (mosaics, 1906) and
also created mosaics and stained glass for Palace_of_Culture (1911-1913) in
MarosvÃ¡sÃ¡rhely.
A notable furniture designer is ÃdÃ¶n_FaragÃ³ [hu] who combined traditional
popular architecture, oriental architecture and international Art Nouveau in a
highly picturesque style. PÃ¡l_Horti [hu], another Hungarian designer, had a
much more sober and functional style, made of oak with delicate traceries of
ebony and brass.
**** Secession in the Austrian Empire (Cisleithania)[edit] ****
    * The Farmers Loan Bank in Ljubljana (Slovenia)
    * Frescoes of Municipal House in Prague by Alphonse_Mucha
    * Ceramic relief of Viola Theater in Prague by Ladislav_Å aloun
    * Culture house in Skalica (Slovakia)
The most prolific Slovenian Art Nouveau architect was Ciril_Metod_Koch.[68] He
studied at Otto_Wagner's classes in Vienna and worked in the Laybach (now
Ljubljana, Slovenia) City Council from 1894 to 1923. After the earthquake in
Laybach in 1895, he designed many secular buildings in Secession style that he
adopted from 1900 to 1910:[68] PogaÄnik House (1901), Äuden Building (1901),
The Farmers Loan Bank (1906â07), renovated Hauptmann Building in Secession
style in 1904. The highlight of his career was the Loan Bank in Radmannsdorf
(now Radovljica) in 1906.[68]
The most notable Secession buildings in Prague are examples of total_art with
distinctive architecture, sculpture and paintings.[69] The_main_railway_station
(1901-1909) was designed by Josef_Fanta and features paintings of VÃ¡clav_Jansa
and sculptures of Ladislav_Å aloun and Stanislav_Sucharda along with other
artists. The Municipal_House (1904-1912) was designed by Osvald_PolÃ­vka and
AntonÃ­n BalÅ¡Ã¡nek, painted by famous Czech painter Alphonse_Mucha and
features sculptures of Josef_MaÅatka and Ladislav_Å aloun. PolÃ­vka, MaÅatka,
and Å aloun simultaneously cooperated in the construction of New_City_Hall
(1908-1911) along with Stanislav_Sucharda, and Mucha later painted St._Vitus
Cathedral's stained glass windows in his distinctive style.
The style of combining Hungarian SzecessziÃ³ and national architectural
elements was typical for a Slovak architect DuÅ¡an_JurkoviÄ . His most
original works are the Cultural House in Szakolca (now Skalica in Slovakia,
1905), buildings of spa in LuhaÄovice (now Czech_Republic) in 1901â1903, and
35 war cemeteries near Nowy_Å»migrÃ³d in Galicia (now Poland), most of them
heavily influenced by local Lemko (Rusyn) folk art and carpentry (1915â1917).
**** Stile Liberty in Italy[edit] ****
    * Floral vase by Galileo_Chini (1896â98)
    * Carlo_Bugatti, Cobra Chair and Desk (1902), Brooklyn_Museum
    * Interior of Casa_Fenoglio-Lafleur by Pietro Fenoglio in Turin (1902)
    * The portal of Casa_Campanini by Alfredo Campanini in Milan (1903-1906)
    * Tea and coffee service with salver and stand, by Carlo_Bugatti (1907)
    * Primavera panel by Galileo_Chini (1914)
Italy's Stile Liberty took its name from the London department store Liberty,
the colourful textiles of which were particularly popular in Italy. Notable
Italian designers included Galileo_Chini, whose ceramics were inspired both by
majolica patterns and by Art Nouveau. He was later known as a painter and a
scenic designer; he designed the sets for two Puccini operas Gianni_Schicchi
and Turandot.
Examples of the Stile Liberty include the Teatro_Massimo by Ernesto_Basile in
Palermo (1897), combining Art Nouveau and classical elements, Casa_Fenoglio-
Lafleur (1902) by Pietro Fenoglio in Turin; Palazzo_Castiglioni (1901-3)[70] by
Giuseppe_Sommaruga, Casa_Campanini (1903-1906) by Alfredo Campanini, and Casa
Guazzoni (1904-6) by Giovanni Battista Bossi (all in Milan).
The most important figure in Italian Art Nouveau furniture design was Carlo
Bugatti, the son of an architect and decorator, father of Rembrandt_Bugatti,
Liberty sculptor, and of Ettore_Bugatti, famous automobile designer. He studied
at the Milanese_Academy_of_Brera, and later the AcadÃ©mie_des_Beaux-Arts in
Paris. His work was distinguished by its exoticism and eccentricity, included
silverware, textiles, ceramics, and musical instruments, but he is best
remembered for his innovative furniture designs, shown first in the 1888 Milan
Fine Arts Fair. His furniture often featured a keyhole design, and had unusual
coverings, including parchment and silk, and inlays of bone and ivory. It also
sometimes had surprising organic shapes, copied after snails and cobras.[71]
**** Modernisme in Catalonia[edit] ****
Main article: Modernisme
    * Sagrada_FamÃ­lia basilica in Barcelona by Antoni_GaudÃ­ (1883â)
    * TrencadÃ­s facade of Casa_BatllÃ³ by Antoni_GaudÃ­ and Josep_Maria_Jujol
      (1904â06)
    * Casa_MilÃ  by Antoni GaudÃ­ (1906â1912)[72]
    * Hospital_de_Sant_Pau by Lluis_Domenech_i_Montaner (1901â30)
    * Casa_de_les_Punxes by Josep_Puig_i_Cadafalch (1905)
A highly original variant of the style appeared in Barcelona, Catalonia. It is
called Modernisme in Catalan and Modernismo in Spanish. Its most famous creator
was Antoni_GaudÃ­, who used Art Nouveau's floral and organic forms in a very
novel way in Palau_GÃ¼ell (1886-1890).[73][74][75] He considered every detail
of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics,
stained_glass, wrought_ironwork forging and carpentry. His work on GÃ¼ell
Pavilions (1884-1887) and then Parc_GÃ¼ell (1900â1914) revealed a new
technique in the treatment of materials called trencadÃ­s, which used waste
ceramic pieces. His designs from about 1903, the Casa_BatllÃ³ (1904â1906) and
Casa_MilÃ  (1906â1912)[72], are most closely related to the stylistic
elements of Art Nouveau.[76] However, famous structures such as the Sagrada
FamÃ­lia characteristically contrast the modernising Art Nouveau tendencies
with revivalist Neo-Gothic.[76] Casa_BatllÃ³, Casa_MilÃ , GÃ¼ell_Pavilions, and
Parc_GÃ¼ell were results of his collaboration with Josep_Maria_Jujol, who
himself created houses in Sant_Joan_DespÃ­ (1913â1926), several churches near
Tarragona (1918 and 1926) and the sinuous Casa Planells (1924) in Barcelona.
Besides the dominating presence of GaudÃ­, LluÃ­s_DomÃ¨nech_i_Montaner also
used Art Nouveau in Barcelona in buildings such as the Castell_dels_Tres
Dragons (1888), Casa_LleÃ³_Morera, Palau_de_la_MÃºsica_Catalana (1905) and
Hospital_de_Sant_Pau (1901-1930).[76] The two latter buildings have been listed
by UNESCO as World_Cultural_Heritage.[77]
Another major modernista was Josep_Puig_i_Cadafalch, who designed the Casa
MartÃ­ and its Els_Quatre_Gats cafÃ©, the Casimir Casaramona textile factory
(now the CaixaFÃ²rum art museum), Casa Macaya, Casa_Amatller, the Palau del
BarÃ³ de Quadras (housing Casa Ãsia for 10 years until 2013) and the Casa_de
les_Punxes ("House of Spikes").

    * Stained glass ceiling of Palau_de_la_MÃºsica_Catalana by Antoni Rigalt
      (1905-1908)
    * Furniture by Gaspar_Homar [ca]
The Modernisme movement left a wide art heritage including drawings, paintings,
sculptures, glass and metal work, mosaics, ceramics, and furniture. A part of
it can be found in Museu_Nacional_d'Art_de_Catalunya.
Inspired by a Paris cafÃ© called Le_Chat_Noir, where he had previously worked,
Pere_Romeu_i_BorrÃ s [ca] decided to open a cafÃ© in Barcelona that was named
Els_Quatre_Gats (Four Cats in Catalan).[78] The cafÃ© became a central meeting
point for Barcelonaâs most prominent figures of Modernisme, such as Pablo
Picasso and Ramon_Casas_i_CarbÃ³ who helped to promote the movement by his
posters and postcards. For the cafÃ© he created a picture called Ramon_Casas
and_Pere_Romeu_on_a_Tandem that was replaced with his another composition
entitled Ramon_Casas_and_Pere_Romeu_in_an_Automobile in 1901, symbolizing the
new century.
Antoni GaudÃ­ himself designed furniture for many houses he built, e.g.
Confidant_from_the_BatllÃ³_House. He influenced another notable Catalan
furniture designer Gaspar_Homar [ca] (1870â1953) who often combined marquetry
and mosaics with his furnishings.[79]
**** Arte Nova in Portugal[edit] ****
    * Facade of Major Pessoa Residence in Aveiro (1907-1909)
    * Atrium of Major Pessoa Residence
    * Tile of Cooperativa AgrÃ­cola in Aveiro (1913)
    * Museum-Residence_Dr._AnastÃ¡cio_GonÃ§alves in Lisbon (1904-1905)
    * The Livraria_Lello bookstore in Porto, Portugal (1906)
The concept defining Art Nouveau variation of Aveiro (Portugal) called Arte
Nova was ostentation: the style was brought by a conservative bourgeoisie who
wanted to express their might by decorative faÃ§ades leaving interiors
conservative.[80] Another distinctive feature of Arte Nova was using locally
produced tiles with Art Nouveau motifs.[80]
The most influential artist of Arte Nova is Francisco Augusto da Silva Rocha.
[80] He designed many building both in Aveiro and in other cities in Portugal,
[81] while actually not being an architect (it was common for Aveiro that
time).[80] One of them has both an exterior and interior of Art Nouveau and now
hosts the Museum of Arte Nova - it is the Major Pessoa Residence. Another
notable example is the Former Cooperativa AgrÃ­cola featuring hand-painted
tiles. There are some Art Nouveau sculptures at the Central cemetery of Aveiro
as well.[80]
There most notable examples of Arte Nova in other cities of Portugal[82][83]
are the Museum-Residence_Dr._AnastÃ¡cio_GonÃ§alves by Manuel_Joaquim_Norte
JÃºnior [pt](1904-1905) in Lisbon, CafÃ©_Majestic [pt] by JoÃ£o_Queiroz [pt]
(1921) and Livraria_Lello bookstore by Xavier_Esteves [pt](1906), both in
Porto.

Art Nouveau was popular in the Nordic_countries, where it was usually known as
Jugendstil, and was often combined with the National_Romantic_Style of each
country. The Nordic country with the largest number of Jugendstil buildings is
the Grand_Duchy_of_Finland, then a part of Russian_Empire.[84] The Jugendstil
period coincided with Golden_Age_of_Finnish_Art and national awakening. After
Paris_Exposition in 1900 the leading Finnish artist was Akseli_Gallen-Kallela.
[85] He is known for his illustrations of the Kalevala, the Finnish national
epic, as well as for painting numerous Judendstil buildings in the Duchy.
The architects of the Finnish pavilion at the Exposition were Herman_Gesellius,
Armas_Lindgren, and Eliel_Saarinen. They worked together from 1896 to 1905 and
created many notable buildings in Helsinki including Pohjola_Insurance_building
(1899â1901) and National_Museum_of_Finland (1905â1910)[86] as well as their
joint residence HvittrÃ¤sk in Kirkkonummi (1902). Architects were inspired by
Nordic legends and nature, rough granite faÃ§ade thus became a symbol for
belonging to the Finnish nation.[87] After the firm dissolved, Saarinen
designed the Helsinki_Railway_Station (1905â1914) in clearer forms,
influenced by American architecture.[87] The sculptor who worked with Saarinen
in construction of National Museum of Finland and Helsinki Railway Station was
Emil_WikstrÃ¶m.
Another architect who created several masterpieces in Finland was Lars_Sonck.
His major Jugendstil works include Tampere_Cathedral (1902-1907), Ainola, the
home of Jean_Sibelius (1903), Headquarters of the Helsinki Telephone
Association (1903-1907) and Kallio_Church in Helsinki (1908-1912).

    * Art_Nouveau_Centre in Ãlesund (1905-1907)
    * Interior of Art Nouveau Centre in Ãlesund
    * Ornaments of a door in Art Nouveau Centre in Ãlesund
Norway also was aspiring independence (from Sweden) and local Art Nouveau was
connected with a revival inspired by Viking folk art and crafts. Notable
designers included Lars Kisarvik, who designed chairs with traditional Viking
and Celtic patterns, and Gerhard_Munthe, who designed a chair with a stylized
dragon-head emblem from ancient Viking ships, as well as a wide variety of
posters, paintings and graphics.[88]
The Norwegian town of Ãlesund is regarded as the main centre of Art Nouveau in
Scandinavia because it was completely reconstructed after a fire of 23 January
1904.[89] 350 buildings were built between 1904 and 1907 under an urban plan
designed by the engineer Frederik NÃ¦sser. The merger of unity and variety gave
birth to a style known as Ãl Stil. Buildings of the style have linear decor
and echoes of both Jugendstil and vernacular elements, e.g. towers of stave
churches or the crested roofs.[89] One of the buildings, Swan Pharmacy, now
hosts the Art_Nouveau_Centre.

former City Library (now Danish_National_Business_Archives) in Aarhus, Denmark
(1898-1901).[91] The architect of the latter is Hack_Kampmann, then a proponent
of National_Romantic_Style who also created Custom_House, Theatre and Villa
Kampen in Aarhus.

A very colourful Russian variation of Art Nouveau appeared in Moscow and Saint
Petersburg in 1898 with the publication of a new art journal, "ÐÐ¸Ñ
Ð¸ÑÐºÑÑÑÑÐ²Ð°" (transliteration: Mir_Iskusstva) ("The World of Art"), by
Russian artists Alexandre_Benois and LÃ©on_Bakst, and chief editor Sergei
Diaghilev. The magazine organized exhibitions of leading Russian artists,
including Mikhail_Vrubel, Konstantin_Somov, Isaac_Levitan, and the book
illustrator Ivan_Bilibin. The World of Art style made less use of the vegetal
and floral forms of French Art Nouveau; it drew heavily upon the bright colours
and exotic designs of Russian folklore and fairy tales. The most influential
contribution of the "World of Art" was the creation by Diaghilev of a new
ballet company, the Ballets_Russes, headed by Diaghilev, with costumes and sets
designed by Bakst and Benois. The new ballet company premiered in Paris in
1909, and performed there every year through 1913. The exotic and colourful
sets designed by Benois and Bakst had a major impact on French art and design.
The costume and set designs were reproduced in the leading Paris magazines,
L'Illustration, La_Vie_parisienne and Gazette_du_bon_ton, and the Russian style
became known in Paris as Ã  la Bakst. The company was stranded in Paris first
by the outbreak of World War I, and then by the Russian_Revolution in 1917, and
ironically never performed in Russia.[92]
Art Nouveau in Russia was promoted not only by single architects but also by
art colonies who worked in the Russian_Revival style that is sometimes
considered as the Russian version of the National Romantic European movement.
The two best-known colonies were situated in Abramtsevo, funded by Savva
Mamontov, and Talashkino, Smolensk_Governorate, funded by Princess_Maria
Tenisheva. They most notably feature interiors and ceramics.

    * Pertsova House by Sergey_Malyutin in Moscow (1905-1907)
    * Bas-reliefs at facade of Trinity Church Apartments (1908-1909)
Art Nouveau Architecture in Russia was highly influenced by contemporary
movements[93] constituting Art Nouveau style (Glasgow_School, Jugendstil of
Germany, Vienna_Secession, National_Romantic_style of Nordic countries (one of
which, Grand_Duchy_of_Finland, was a part of Russian_Empire) and the Franco-
Belgian Art Nouveau). However, there are examples of artistic expression that
blended Art Nouveau with Russian_Revival_architecture, which drew from historic
Russian_architecture, mostly in wood, and referred to the Architecture_of
Kievan_Rus'.
One of these examples is works of Sergey_Malyutin: Teremok House in Talashkino
(1901-1902) where he worked in the art colony and Pertsova House (also known as
Pertsov House) in Moscow (1905-1907). He also was a member of Mir_iskusstva
movement. Another blend of Russian_Revival and Art Nouveau principles is
Yaroslavsky_railway_station in Moscow by Franz_(Fyodor)_Schechtel (1902-1904).
The Saint_Petersburg architect Nikolai_Vasilyev built in a range of styles
before emigrating in 1923. By some researches[93] Trinity Church Apartments
building (also known as House with Beasts, 1908-1909) is also characterized as
Art Nouveau. This building is most notable for stone carvings made by Sergei
Vashkov inspired by the carvings of Cathedral_of_Saint_Demetrius in Vladimir
and Saint_George_Cathedral_in_Yuryev-Polsky of XII and XIII centuries.
**** JÅ«gendstils (Art Nouveau in Riga)[edit] ****

Riga, the present-day capital of Latvia, was at the time one of the major
cities of the Russian_Empire. Art_Nouveau_architecture_in_Riga nevertheless
developed according to its own dynamics, and the style became overwhelmingly
popular in the city. Soon after the Latvian Ethnographic Exhibition in 1896 and
the Industrial and Handicrafts Exhibition in 1901, Art Nouveau became the
dominant style in the city.[94] Thus Art Nouveau architecture accounts for one-
third of all the buildings in the centre of Riga, making it the city with the
highest concentration of such buildings anywhere in the world. The quantity and
quality of Art Nouveau architecture was among the criteria for including Riga
in UNESCO_World_Cultural_Heritage.[95]
There were different variations of Art Nouveau architecture in Riga:
    * in Eclectic Art Nouveau, floral and other nature-inspired elements of
      decoration were most popular. Examples of that variation are works of
      Mikhail_Eisenstein,
    * in Perpendicular Art Nouveau, geometrical ornaments were integrated into
      the vertical compositions of the facades. Several department stores where
      built in this style, and it is sometimes also referred to as "department
      store style" or Warenhausstil in German,
    * National Romantic Art Nouveau was inspired by local folk art, monumental
      volumes and the use of natural building materials.
Some later Neo-Classical buildings also contained Art Nouveau details.
**** Style Sapin in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland[edit] ****
    * Villa_Fallet with fir-inspired decoration (1905)

    * Crematorium (1909), detail
    * Art Nouveau Balconies in La Chaux-de-Fonds
The Swiss variation called Style Sapin was born in La_Chaux-de-Fonds as a mix
of French and Belgian Art Nouveau, German Jugendstil and Vienna Secession
because of the townâs location.[96] The most prominent work is The La Chaux-
de-Fonds Crematorium where Charles_lâEplattenier acted as a painter and
sculptor and his pupils at the city's Ecole d'Art (Art School)[96] Robert Belli
and Henri Robert acted as architects.[97]
A notable building with fir-inspired motifs is Villa_Fallet whose architects
were RenÃ© Chapallaz and Charles-Ãdouard Jeanneret known later better known as
Le_Corbusier, also a pupil of Charles_lâEplattenier.[96][98]
**** Tiffany Style in the United States[edit] ****
    * Tiffany_Chapel from the 1893 Word's Columbian Exposition, now in the
      Charles_Hosmer_Morse_Museum_of_American_Art in Winter_Park,_Florida.
    * Glass vase by Louis_Comfort_Tiffany now in the Cincinnati_Art_Museum
      (1893â96)
    * Lily lamp by Louis Comfort Tiffany (1900â1910)
    * Tiffany window in his house at Oyster Bay, New York
    * The Flight of Souls Window by Louis_Comfort_Tiffany won a gold medal at
      the 1900 Paris Exposition
In the United States, the firm of Louis_Comfort_Tiffany played a central role
in American Art Nouveau. Born in 1848, he studied at the National_Academy_of
Design in New York, began working with glass at the age of 24, entered the
family business started by his father, and 1885 set up his own enterprise
devoted to fine glass, and developed new techniques for its colouring. In 1893,
he began making glass vases and bowls, again developing new techniques that
allowed more original shapes and colouring, and began experimenting with
decorative window glass. Layers of glass were printed, marbled and
superimposed, giving an exceptional richness and variety of colour In 1895 his
new works were featured in the Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing, giving
him a new European clientele. After the death of his father in 1902, he took
over the entire Tiffany enterprise, but still devoted much of his time to
designing and manufacturing glass art objects. At the urging of Thomas_Edison,
he began to manufacture electric lamps with multicoloured glass shades in
structures of bronze and iron, or decorated with mosaics, produced in numerous
series and editions, each made with the care of a piece of jewellery. A team of
designers and craftsmen worked on each product. The Tiffany lamp in particular
became one of the icons of the Art Nouveau, but Tiffany's craftsmen (and
craftswomen) designed and made extraordinary windows, vases, and other glass
art. Tiffany's glass also had great success at the 1900_Exposition_Universelle
in Paris; his stained glass window called the Flight of Souls won a gold medal.
[99]
Another important figure in American Art Nouveau was the architect Louis
Sullivan,[100][101] best known as the architect of some of the first American
iron-framed skyscrapers. At the 1893 World's_Columbian_Exposition in Chicago,
most famous for the neoclassical architecture of its renowned White City, he
designed a spectacular Art Nouveau entrance to the Transportation Building. The
Columbian Exposition was also an important venue for Tiffany; a chapel he
designed was shown at the Pavilion of Art and Industry. The Tiffany Chapel,
along with one of the windows of Tiffany's home in New York, are now on display
at the Charles_Hosmer_Morse_Museum_of_American_Art in Winter_Park,_Florida.
**** Art Nouveau in Argentina[edit] ****
    * Stained glass and sculptures by Ercole Pasina in Calise House in Buenos
      Aires (1911)
    * Interior of GalerÃ­a_GÃ¼emes, Buenos_Aires by Francisco_Gianotti (1913)
    * Palacio_Barolo in Buenos_Aires by Mario_Palanti (1919-1923)
    * Metal work, ceramics and statues at the facade of Club_EspaÃ±ol_building 
      [es] in Rosario (1912)
    * Ceramic chimney of ConfiterÃ­a La Europea in Rosario (1916)
Flooded with immigrants, Argentina welcomed all artistic and architectural
European styles, Art Nouveau was not an exclusion.[102] Cities with the most
notable Art Nouveau heritage in Argentina are Buenos_Aires, Rosario and Mar_del
Plata.[103]
Paris was a prototype for Buenos Aires with the construction of large
boulevards and avenues in the 19th century.[102] The local style along with
French influence was also following Italian Liberty as many architects
(Virginio_Colombo, Francisco_Gianotti, Mario_Palanti) were Italians. In works
of JuliÃ¡n_GarcÃ­a_NÃºÃ±ez [es] Catalan influence can be noted as he completed
his studies in Barcelona in 1900.[102] The influence of Vienna_Secession can be
found at Paso y Viamonte building.[102]
The introduction of Art Nouveau in Rosario is connected to Francisco_Roca
SimÃ³ [es] who trained in Barcelona.[104] His Club_EspaÃ±ol_building [es]
(1912) features one of the largest stained glass windows in Latin America
produced (as well as tiling and ceramics) by the local firm Buxadera, Fornells
y CÃ­a.[105] The sculptor of the building is Diego Masana from Barcelona.[105]
Belgian influence on Argentinian Art Nouveau is represented by the Villa Ortiz
Basualdo, now containing the Juan_Carlos_Castagnino_Municipal_Museum_of_Art in
Mar_del_Plata where the furniture, interiors, and lighting are by Gustave
Serrurier-Bovy.
**** Art Nouveau in the rest of the world[edit] ****
    * ThÃ©Ã¢tre_municipal in Tunisia (1902)
    * Goerke-Haus in LÃ¼deritz, Namibia, (1909-1910)
    * Ostroumov House in Harbin, China (1920)
    * Palacio Salvo in Montevideo, Uruguay (1926)
    * Statue_of_Pegasus in Mexico_City
As in Argentina, Art Nouveau in other countries was mostly influenced by
foreign architects:
    * Catalans were behind Art Nouveau projects in Havana, Cuba, they were even
      not qualified enough to be called architects.[106]. Catalans were not
      directly involved in works in Ponce,_Puerto_Rico but were an inspiration
      and a subject of study for local architects in Ponce,_Puerto_Rico[107],
    * French were behind Art Nouveau in Tunisia (that was a French_protectorate
      then),
    * Germans were behind Jugendstil heritage of LÃ¼deritz, Namibia[108];
      Qingdao, China,
    * Italians were behind Art Nouveau in Valparaiso, Chile[109]; Montevideo,
      Uruguay; Rio_de_Janeiro, Brasil,[110]
    * Russians were behind Art Nouveau heritage of Harbin, China,[111]
    * Art Nouveau Heritage in Lima consists of work of Italians Masperi
      brothers, French architect Claude Sahut and British masters of stained
      glass[112]
    * Palacio_de_Bellas_Artes in Mexico_City was a result of the cooperation of
      Italians (architect Adamo_Boari and sculptor Leonardo_Bistolfi), local
      architect Federico_Mariscal [es], Hungarian artists AladÃ¡r_KÃ¶rÃ¶sfÅi-
      Kriesch, GÃ©za_MarÃ³ti and Miksa_RÃ³th, Catalan sculptor AgustÃ­_Querol
      Subirats and French master Edgar_Brandt.[113]
***** Characteristics[edit] *****
    * Coup de Fouet or "Whiplash" design by Hermann_Obrist (1895)
    * An abundance of light. Skylight in HÃ´tel_van_Eetvelde by Victor_Horta
      (1895-1899)[114]
    * Stylized vegetal forms; Entrance of the Anvers Metro Station in Paris by
      Hector_Guimard (1900)
    * Floral patterns. Lamp with Wisteria design by Louis_Comfort_Tiffany
      (1899-1900)
    * Exotic materials and decoration. Mahogany and amourette wood cabinet with
      water lily decoration of gilded bronze by Louis_Majorelle (1905-08)
    * Highly stylized natural forms in balconies and railings. Otto_Wagner

    * Strict geometry of Vienna_Secession. the Sanatorium_Purkersdorf by Josef
      Hoffmann and Koloman_Moser (1904)
    * Geometric lines the Vienna_Secession; Palais_Stoclet by Josef_Hoffmann
      (1905-1911)
    * Cubic form and geometric decoration of Villa Wagner II by Otto_Wagner
      (1912-1913)
Early Art Nouveau, particularly in Belgium and France, was also characterized
by undulating, curving forms inspired by lilies, vines, flower stems and other
natural forms. used in particular in the interiors of the of Victor_Horta and
the decoration of Louis_Majorelle and Emile_GallÃ©.[115] It also drew upon
patterns based on butterflies and dragonflies, borrowed from Japanese art,
which were popular in Europe at the time.[116]
Early Art Nouveau also often featured more stylized forms expressing movement,
such as the coup de fouet or "whiplash" line, used by designer Hermann_Obrist
in 1894. A description published in Pan magazine of Hermann_Obrist's wall
hanging Cyclamen (1894) described it as "sudden violent curves generated by the
crack of a whip,"[117] The term "whiplash" is frequently applied to the
characteristic curves employed by Art Nouveau artists.[117] Such decorative
"whiplash" motifs, formed by dynamic, undulating, and flowing lines in a
syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape, are found throughout the
architecture, painting, sculpture, and other forms of Art Nouveau design.[117]
Floral forms were popular, inspired by lilies, wisteria and other flowers,
particularly in the lamps of Louis_Comfort_Tiffany and the glass objects made
by the artists of the School_of_Nancy and Ãmile_GallÃ©. Stylized floral forms
were particularly used by Victor_Horta in carpets, balustrades, windows, and
furniture. The were also used extensively by Hector_Guimard for balustrades,
and,most famously, for the lamps and railings at the entrances of the Paris
Metro. Guimard explained: "That which must be avoided in everything that is
continuous is the parallel and symmetry. Nature is the greatest builder and
nature makes nothing that is parallel and nothing that is symmetrical."[118]
Earlier Art Nouveau furniture, such as that made by Louis_Majorelle and Henry
Van_de_Velde, was characterized by the use of exotic and expensive materials,
including mahogany with inlays of precious woods and trim, and curving forms
without right angles. It gave a sensation of lightness.
In the second phase of Art Nouveau, following 1900, the decoration became purer
and the lines were more stylized. The curving lines and forms evolved into
polygons and then into cubes and other geometric forms. These geometric forms
were used with particular effect in the architecture and furniture of Joseph
Maria_Olbrich, Otto_Wagner, Koloman_Moser and Josef_Hoffmann, especially the
Palais_Stoclet in Brussels, which announced the arrival of Art_Deco and
modernism.[58][59][119]
Another characteristic of Art Nouveau architecture was the use of light, by
opening up of interior spaces, by the removal of walls, and the extensive use
of skylights to bring a maximum amount of light into the interior. The
residence-studio of architect and other houses built Victor_Horta had extensive
skylights, supported on curving iron frames. In the Hotel_Tassel he removed the
traditional walls around the stairway, so that the stairs became a central
element of the interior design.
***** Influences[edit] *****
The origins of Art Nouveau are sometimes attributed in the resistance of the
artist William_Morris to the cluttered compositions and the revival tendencies
of the 19th century and his theories that helped initiate the Arts_and_crafts
movement.[120] Arthur_Mackmurdo's book-cover for Wren's City Churches (1883),
with its rhythmic floral patterns, is also sometimes described as the first
realisation of Art Nouveau.[120] About the same time, the flat perspective and
strong colours of Japanese_wood_block_prints, especially those of Katsushika
Hokusai, had a strong effect on the formulation of Art Nouveau.[121] The
Japonisme that was popular in Europe during the 1880s and 1890s was
particularly influential on many artists with its organic forms and references
to the natural world.[121] Besides being adopted by artists like Emile_GallÃ©
and James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler, Japanese-inspired art and design was
championed by the businessmen Siegfried_Bing and Arthur_Lasenby_Liberty at
their stores, in Paris and London respectively.[122][121]
Doorway at 24 place Etienne Pernet, (Paris_15e), 1905 Alfred Wagon, architect.
In architecture, hyperbolas and parabolas in windows, arches, and doors are
common, and decorative mouldings 'grow' into plant-derived forms. Like most
design styles, Art Nouveau sought to harmonise its forms. The text above the
Paris Metro entrance uses the qualities of the rest of the iron work in the
structure.[123]
***** Relationship with contemporary styles and movements[edit] *****
Portrait_of_Adele_Bloch-Bauer_I by Gustav_Klimt (1907)
As an art style, Art Nouveau has affinities with the Pre-Raphaelites and the
Symbolist styles, and artists like Aubrey_Beardsley, Alphonse_Mucha, Edward
Burne-Jones, Gustav_Klimt and Jan_Toorop could be classed in more than one of
these styles. Unlike Symbolist painting, however, Art Nouveau has a distinctive
appearance; and, unlike the artisan-oriented Arts_and_Crafts_Movement, Art
Nouveau artists readily used new materials, machined surfaces, and abstraction
in the service of pure design.
Art Nouveau did not eschew the use of machines, as the Arts and Crafts Movement
did. For sculpture, the principal materials employed were glass and wrought
iron, resulting in sculptural qualities even in architecture. Ceramics were
also employed in creating editions of sculptures by artists such as Auguste
Rodin.[124]
Art Nouveau architecture made use of many technological innovations of the late
19th century, especially the use of exposed iron and large, irregularly shaped
pieces of glass for architecture.
Art Nouveau tendencies were also absorbed into local styles. In Denmark, for
example, it was one aspect of SkÃ¸nvirke ("aesthetic work"), which itself more
closely relates to the Arts_and_Crafts_style.[125][126] Likewise, artists
adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the MÅoda
Polska ("Young Poland") style in Poland.[127] MÅoda Polska, however, was also
inclusive of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art,
literature, and lifestyle.[128]
***** Genres[edit] *****
Art Nouveau is represented in painting and sculpture, but it is most prominent
in architecture and the decorative_arts. It was well-suited to the graphic
arts, especially the poster, interior_design, metal and glass_art, jewellery,
furniture_design, ceramics and textiles.
**** Posters and Graphic Art[edit] ****

    * illustration from Ver Sacrum by Koloman Moser (1900)
    * Festival poster by Ludwig_Hohlwein (1910)
The graphic arts flourished in the Art Nouveau period, thanks to new
technologies of printing, particularly colour lithography, which allowed the
mass production of colour posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries,
museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art
magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The
most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour,
modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.
In Britain, the leading graphic artist in the Art Nouveau style was Aubrey
Beardsley (1872-1898). He began with engraved book illustrations for Le_Morte
d'Arthur, then black and white illustrations for Salome by Oscar_Wilde (1893),
which brought him fame. In the same year, he began engraving illustrations and
posters for the art magazine The Studio, which helped publicize European
artists such as Fernand_Khnopff in Britain. The curving lines and intricate
floral patterns attracted as much attention as the text.[129]
The Swiss-French artist EugÃ¨ne_Grasset (1845-1917) was one of the first
creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret
Le_Chat_noir in 1885 and made his first posters for the FÃªtes de Paris. He
made a celebrated poster of Sarah_Bernhardt in 1890, and a wide variety of book
illustrations. The artist-designers Jules_ChÃ©ret, Georges_de_Feure and the
painter Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec all made posters for Paris theaters, cafÃ©s,
dance halls cabarets. The Czech artist Alphonse_Mucha (1860â1939) arrived in
Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the
play Gismonda by Victorien_Sardou. The success of this poster led to a contract
to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt. Over the next four years,
he also designed sets, costumes, and even jewellery for the actress.[130][131]
Based on the success of his theater posters, Mucha made posters for a variety
of products, ranging from cigarettes and soap to beer biscuits, all featuring
an idealized female figure with an hourglass figure. He went on to design
products, from jewellery to biscuit boxes, in his distinctive style.[132]
In Vienna, the most prolific designer of graphics and posters was Koloman_Moser
(1868-1918), who actively participated in the Secession movement with Gustav
Klimt and Josef_Hoffmann, and made illustrations and covers for the magazine of
the movement, Ver_Sacrum, as well as paintings, furniture and decoration.[133]

Painting was another domain of Art Nouveau, though most painters associated
with Art Nouveau are primarily described as members of other movements,
particularly post-impressionism and symbolism. Alphonse_Mucha was famous for
his Art Nouveau posters, which frustrated him. According to his son and
biographer, JiÅÃ­_Mucha, he did not think much of Art Nouveau. "What is it,
Art Nouveau? he asked. "...Art can never be new." [134] He took the greatest
pride in his work as a history painter. His one Art-Nouveau inspired painting,
"Slava", is a portrait of the daughter of his patron in Slavic costume, which
was modelled after his theatrical posters. [134]
In 1892, Siegfried_Bing organized an exhibition in Paris featuring seven
painters, including Pierre_Bonnard, Ãdouard_Vuillard, FÃ©lix_Vallotton, and
Maurice_Denis; and his Maison de l'Art Nouveau exhibited paintings by Georges
Seurat, Paul_Signac, and Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec. EugÃ¨ne_Grasset, Koloman
Moser and Gustav_Klimt also did some decorative work. However, all of these
artists are primarily known for paintings in movements outside Art Nouveau.
Seurat and Signac were known for Post-impressionism well before the appearance
of Art Nouveau. Bonnard, Vuillard and Vallaton were members of the Post-
Impressionist group of avant-garde painters Les_Nabis.[135] Maurice_Denis did
some interior design work in the Art Nouveau style, but his easel paintings
were firmly in the style of the Nabis. In Belgium, Fernand_Khnopff worked in
both painting and graphic design. Wall murals by Gustav Klimt were integrated
into decorative scheme of Josef_Hoffmann for the Palais_Stoclet, but the
paintings of Klimt and Khnopff are usually considered examples of symbolism
rather than Art Nouveau.
One subject did appear both in traditional painting and Art Nouveau; the
American dancer Loie_Fuller, was portrayed by French and Austrian painters and
poster artists.[136]

Glass_art was a medium in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of
expression. Intense amount of experimentation went on, particularly in France,
to find new effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double
layers, and acid engraving, a technique that permitted production in series.
The city of Nancy became an important centre for the French glass industry, and
the workshops of Emile_GallÃ© and the Daum studio, led by Auguste and Antonin
Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including
Ernest_BussiÃ¨re [fr], Henri_BergÃ©_(illustrateur) [fr], and Amalric_Walter.
They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of
different coloured glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated
with the furniture designer Louis_Majorelle, whose home and workshops were in
Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau was the use of stained glass windows with
that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art
Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Gruber, who made windows
for the Villa_Majorelle and other houses.[137]
In Belgium, the leading firm was the glass factory of Val_Saint_Lambert, which
created vases in organic and floral forms, many of them designed by Philippe
Wolfers. Wolfers was noted particularly for creating works of symbolist glass,
often with metal decoration attached. In Bohemia, then a region of the Austro-
Hungarian_Empire noted for crystal manufacture, the companies J._&_L._Lobmeyr
and Joh._Loetz_Witwe [de] also experimented with new colouring techniques,
producing more vivid and richer colours. In Germany, experimentation was led by
Karl KÃ¶pping, who used blown glass to create extremely delicate glasses in the
form of flowers; so delicate that few survive today.[138]
In Vienna, the glass designs of the Secession movement were much more
geometrical than those of France or Belgium; Otto_Prutscher was the most
rigorous glass designer of the movement.[138] In Britain, a number of floral
stained glass designs were created by Margaret_Macdonald_Mackintosh for the
architectural display called "The House of an Art Lover."
In the United States, Louis_Comfort_Tiffany and his designers became
particularly famous for their lamps, whose glass shades used common floral
themes intricately pieced together. Tiffany lamps gained popularity after the
World's_Columbian_Exposition in Chicago in 1893, where Tiffany displayed his
lamps in a Byzantine-like chapel. Tiffany experimented extensively with the
processes of colouring glass, patenting in 1894 the process Favrile_glass,
which used metallic oxides to colour the interior of the molten glass, giving
it an iridescent effect. His workshops produced several different series of the
Tiffany_lamp in different floral designs, along with stained glass windows,
screens, vases and a range of decorative objects. His works were first imported
to Germany, then to France by Siegfried_Bing, and then became one of the
decorative sensations of the 1900 Exposition. An American rival to Tiffany,
Steuben_Glass, was founded in 1903 in Corning,_NY, by Frederick_Carder, who,
like Tiffany, used the Fevrile process to create surfaces with iridescent
colours. Another notable American glass artist was John_La_Farge, who created
intricate and colourful stained glass windows on both religious and purely
decorative themes.[138]

    * Gate of the Palais_Stoclet by Josef_Hoffmann, Brussels (1905-1911)
    * Gate of Villa Knopf in Strasbourg (1905)
The 19th-century architectural theorist Viollet-le-Duc had advocated showing,
rather than concealing the iron frameworks of modern buildings, but Art Nouveau
architects Victor_Horta and Hector_Guimard went a step further: they added iron
decoration in curves inspired by floral and vegetal forms both in the interiors
and exteriors of their buildings. They took the form of stairway railings in
the interior, light fixtures, and other details in the interior, and balconies
and other ornaments on the exterior. These became some of the most distinctive
features of Art Nouveau architecture. The use of metal decoration in vegetal
forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items.[139]
In the United States, the designer George_Grant_Elmslie made extremely
intricate cast iron designs for the balustrades and other interior decoration
of the buildings of Chicago architect Louis_Sullivan.
While French and American designers used floral and vegetal forms, Joseph_Maria
Olbrich and the other Secession artists designed teapots and other metal
objects in a more geometric and sober style.[140]

Art Nouveau jewellery's characteristics include subtle curves and lines. Its
design often features natural objects including flowers, animals or birds. The
female body is also popular often appearing on cameos. It frequently included
long necklaces made of pearls or sterling-silver chains punctuated by glass
beads or ending in a silver or gold pendant, itself often designed as an
ornament to hold a single, faceted jewel of amethyst, peridot, or citrine.[141]
The Art Nouveau period brought a notable stylistic revolution to the jewellery
industry, led largely by the major firms in Paris. For the previous two
centuries, the emphasis in fine jewellery had been creating dramatic settings
for diamonds. During the reign of Art Nouveau, diamonds usually played a
supporting role. Jewellers experimented with a wide variety of other stones,
including agate, garnet opal, moonstone, aquamarine and other semi-precious
stones, and with a wide variety of new techniques, among others enamelling, and
new materials, including horn, moluded glass, and ivory.
Early notable Paris jewellers in the Art Nouveau style included Louis_Aucoc,
whose family jewellery firm dated to 1821. The most famous designer of the Art
Nouveau period, RenÃ©_Lalique, served his apprenticeship in the Aucoc studio
from 1874 to 1876. Lalique became a central figure of Art Nouveau jewellery and
glass, using nature, from dragonflies to grasses, as his models. Artists from
outside of the traditional world of jewellery, such as Paul_Follot, best known
as a furniture designer, experimented with jewellery designs. Other notable
French Art Nouveau jewellery designers included Jules_Brateau and Georges
Henry. In the United States, the most famous designer was Louis_Comfort
Tiffany, whose work was shown at the shop of Siegfried_Bing and also at the
1900 Paris Exposition.
In Britain, the most prominent figure was the Liberty & Co. designer Archibald
Knox, who made a variety of Art Nouveau pieces, including silver belt buckles.
C._R._Ashbee designed pendants in the shapes of peacocks. The versatile Glasgow
designer Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh also made jewellery, using traditional
Celtic symbols. In Germany, the centre for Jugendstil jewellery was the city of
Pforzheim, where most of the German firms, including Theodor_Fahrner, were
located. They quickly produced works to meet the demand for the new style.
[141]
**** Architecture and ornamentation[edit] ****
    * Thistles and curve-lined mascarons in decoration of Les Chardons building
      by Charles Klein in Paris (1903)
    * Judengstil straight-lined mascaron in Riga, Latvia (1906)
    * Coup de fouet (whiplash) motifs at Vitebsky_railway_station by Sima
      Mihash and Stanislav Brzozowski, Saint_Petersburg (1904)
    * Asymmetric facade with curved lines of De Beck building by Gustave
      Strauven in Brussels (1905)
    * Irises and mascaron at the facade of Schichtel building by Aloys Walter
      in Strasbourg, France (1905-06)
Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles that
dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was
expressed through decoration: either ornamental (based on flowers and plants,
e.g. thistles[142], irises[143], cyclamens, orchids, water lilies etc.) or
sculptural (see the respective_section below). While faces of people (or
mascarons) are referred to ornament, the use of people in different forms of
sculpture (statues and reliefs: see the respective_section below) were also
typical for Art Nouveau. Before Vienna_Secession, Jugendstil and National
romantic_style faÃ§ades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome
ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no
distinction between the structure and the ornament.[144] The whiplash motif was
widely used.
The style first appeared in Brussels' Hankar_House [fr] by Paul_Hankar (1893)
and HÃ´tel_Tassel (1892-3) of Victor_Horta. The HÃ´tel Tassel was visited by
Hector_Guimard, who used the same style in his first major work, the Castel
BÃ©ranger (1897â98). Horta and Guimard also designed the furniture and the
interior decoration, down to the doorknobs and carpeting. In 1899, based on the
fame of the Castel BÃ©ranger, Guimard received a commission to design the
entrances_of_the_stations of the new Paris_MÃ©tro, which opened in 1900. Though
few of the originals survived, these became the symbol of the Art Nouveau
movement in Paris.
In Paris, the architectural style was also a reaction to the strict regulations
imposed on building facades by Georges-EugÃ¨ne_Haussmann, the prefect of Paris
under Napoleon_III. Bow_windows were finally allowed in 1903, and Art Nouveau
architects went to the opposite extreme, most notably in the houses of Jules
Lavirotte, which were essentially large works of sculpture, completely covered
with decoration. An important neighbourhood of Art Nouveau houses appeared in
the French city of Nancy, around the Villa_Majorelle (1901â02), the residence
of the furniture designer Louis_Majorelle. It was designed by Henri_Sauvage as
a showcase for Majorelle's furniture designs.[145]

Many Art Nouveau buildings were included in UNESCO_World_Cultural_Heritage list
as a part of their city centres (in Bern, Budapest, Lviv, Paris, Porto, Prague,
Riga, Saint_Petersburg, Strasbourg (Neustadt), Vienna). Along with them, there
were buildings that were included in the list as separate objects:
    *  Belgium: works of Victor_Horta (HÃ´tel_Tassel, HÃ´tel_Solvay, HÃ´tel_van
      Eetvelde, Maison_and_Atelier_Horta)[5] and the Stoclet_Palace by Josef
      Hoffmann in Brussels

      Germany (1905)
    * Ceramic puttis in Music conservatory of Barcelona by Eusebi Arnau (1916-

Sculpture was another form of expression for Art Nouveau artists, crossing with
ceramics sometimes. The porcelain figurine Dancer with a Scarf by Agathon
LÃ©onard won recognition both in ceramics and in sculpture at the Paris
Exposition in 1900. Sculptors of other countries also created ceramic
sculptures: Bohemian Stanislav_Sucharda and Ladislav_Å aloun, Belgian Charles
Van_der_Stappen and Catalan Lambert_Escaler [ca], who created statues of
polychrome terracotta. Another notable sculptor of that time was AgustÃ­_Querol
Subirats from Catalonia who created statues in Spain, Mexico, Argentina, and
Cuba.[147].
In architectural_sculpture not only statues but also reliefs were used. Art
Nouveau architects and sculptors found inspiration in animal motifs
(butterflies,[148] peacocks,[149] swans,[150] owls,[151] bats,[152] dragons,
[153] bears[154]). Atlantes,[155] caryatids,[156] putti,[157] and gargoyles
[158] were also used.

Furniture design in the Art Nouveau period was closely associated with the
architecture of the buildings; the architects often designed the furniture,
carpets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and other decorative details. The furniture
was often complex and expensive; a fine finish, usually polished or varnished,
was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex,
with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It also had the drawback that
the owner of the home could not change the furniture or add pieces in a
different style without disrupting the entire effect of the room. For this
reason, when Art Nouveau architecture went out of style, the style of furniture
also largely disappeared.
In France, the centre for furniture design and manufacture was in Nancy, where
two major designers, Ãmile_GallÃ© and Louis_Majorelle had their studios and
workshops, and where the Alliance des industries d'art (later called the School
of Nancy) had been founded in 1901. Both designers based on their structure and
ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, such
as the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. GallÃ© was
particularly known for his use of marquetry in relief, in the form of
landscapes or poetic themes. Majorelle was known for his use of exotic and
expensive woods, and for attaching bronze sculpted in vegetal themes to his
pieces of furniture. Both designers used machines for the first phases of
manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture
designers of the Nancy School included EugÃ¨ne_Vallin and Ãmile_AndrÃ©; both
were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the
furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less
decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers. Other
notable French designers included Henri_Bellery-Desfontaines, who took his
inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of Viollet-le-Duc; and Georges_de_Feure,
EugÃ¨ne_Gaillard, and Ãdouard_Colonna, who worked together with art dealer
Siegfried_Bing to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes.
Their work was known for "abstract naturalism", its unity of straight and
curved lines, and its rococo influence. The furniture of de Feure at the Bing
pavilion won a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition. The most unusual and
picturesque French designer was FranÃ§ois-Rupert_Carabin, a sculptor by
training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic
animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with Symbolism.
Other influential Paris furniture designers were Charles_Plumet, and Alexandre
Charpentier.{sfn|Riley|2007|page=302}} In many ways the old vocabulary and
techniques of classic French 18th-century Rococo furniture were re-interpreted
in a new style.[12]
In Belgium, the pioneer architects of the Art Nouveau movement, Victor_Horta
and Henry_van_de_Velde, designed furniture for their houses, using vigorous
curving lines and a minimum of decoration. The Belgian designer Gustave
Serrurier-Bovy added more decoration, applying brass strips in curving forms.
In the Netherlands, where the style was called Nieuwe Kunst or New Art, H.P.
Berlag, Lion Cachet and Theodor Nieuwenhuis followed a different course, that
of the English Arts_and_Crafts movement, with more geometric rational forms.
In Britain, the furniture of Charles_Rennie_Mackintosh was purely Arts and
Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles and
a minimum of decoration.[159] Continental designs were much more elaborate,
often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied
decorative motifs. In Germany, the furniture of Peter_Behrens and the
Jugendstil was largely rationalist, with geometric straight lines and some
decoration attached to the surface. Their goal was exactly the opposite of
French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for
furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass-manufactured. The same was
true for the furniture of designers of the Wiener_WerkstÃ¤tte in Vienna, led by
Otto_Wagner, Josef_Hoffmann, Josef Maria Olbrich and Koloman_Moser. The
furniture was geometric and had a minimum of decoration, though in style it
often followed national historic precedent, particularly the Biedemeier style.
[160]
Italian and Spanish furniture design went off in their own direction. Carlo
Bugatti in Italy designed the extraordinary Snail Chair, wood covered with
painted parchment and copper, for the Turin International Exposition of 1902.
In Spain, following the lead of Antoni_Gaudi and the Modernismo movement, the
furniture designer Gaspar Homar designed works that were inspired by natural
forms with touches of Catalan historic styles.[88]
In the United States, furniture design was more often inspired by the Arts and
Crafts movement, or by historic American models, than by the Art Nouveau. One
designer who did introduce Art Nouveau themes was Charles_Rohlfs in Buffalo,
New York, whose designs for American white oak furniture were influenced by
motifs of Celtic_Art and Gothic_art, with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal
trim applied to the pieces.[88]

The last part of the 19th century saw many technological innovation in the
manufacture of ceramics, particularly the development of high temperature
(grand feu) porcelain with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time,
several lost techniques, such as oxblood glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau
ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese
ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau
style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional grÃ©s methods and
reinvented them with new motifs. Ceramics also found an important new use in
architecture: Art Nouveau architects, Jules_Lavirotte and Hector_Guimard among
them, began to decorate the faÃ§ades of buildings with ceramic tiles, many of
them made by the firm of Alexandre_Bigot, giving them a distinct Art Nouveau
sculptural look. Art Nouveau ceramics quickly moved into the domain of
sculpture and architecture.{Sfn|Riley|2007|pages=314-15}}
One of the pioneer French Art Nouveau ceramists was Ernest_Chaplet, whose
career in ceramics spanned thirty years. He began producing stoneware
influenced by Japanese and Chinese prototypes. Beginning in 1886, he worked
with painter Paul_Gauguin on stoneware designs with applied figures, multiple
handles, painted and partially glazed, and collaborated with sculptors FÃ©lix
Bracquemond, Jules_Dalou and Auguste_Rodin. His works were acclaimed at the
1900 Exposition.
The major national ceramics firms had an important place at the 1900 Paris
Exposition: the Manufacture_nationale_de_SÃ¨vres outside Paris; Nymphenburg,
Meissen, Villeroy_&_Boch in Germany, and Doulton in Britain. Other leading
French ceramists included Taxile_Doat, Pierre-Adrien_Dalpayrat [fr], Edmond
Lachenal, Albert_Dammouse [fr] and Auguste_Delaherche.[161]
In France, Art Nouveau ceramics sometimes crossed the line into sculpture. The
porcelain figurine Dancer with a Scarf by Agathon_LÃ©onard, made for the
Manufacture_nationale_de_SÃ¨vres, won recognition in both categories at the
1900 Paris Exposition.
The Zsolnay_factory in PÃ©cs, Hungary, was founded by MiklÃ³s_Zsolnay
(1800â1880) in 1853 and led by his son, Vilmos_Zsolnay (1828â1900) with
chief designer TÃ¡dÃ©_Sikorski (1852â1940) to produce stoneware and other
ceramics. In 1893, Zsolnay introduced porcelain pieces made of eosin. He led
the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products
at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873_World_Fair_in
Vienna, then at the 1878_World_Fair_in_Paris, where Zsolnay received a Grand
Prix. Frost-resisting Zsolnay building decorations were used in numerous
buildings, specifically during the Art Nouveau movement.[162]
Ceramic tiles were also a distinctive feature to Portuguese Arte Nova that
continued the long azulejo tradition of the country.
Maiolica was a distinctive feature of the_eponymous_house_in_Vienna and of
works of Russian Abramtsevo_Colony, especially Mikhail_Vrubel.

    * Altar of Kirche_am_Steinhof by Bruno Mayer, Vienna (1903-1907)
    * Mosaics designed by Oskar Graf for Merkelâsches_Schwimmbad [de] in
      Esslingen_am_Neckar, Germany (1905-1907)
    * Mosaics of Villa l'Aube by Auguste Donnay, Belgium
    * Mandylion by Nicholas_Roerich in Talashkino, Russia (1908-1914)[163]
    * Mosaics for Palace_of_Culture by AladÃ¡r_KÃ¶rÃ¶sfÅi-Kriesch and Miksa
      RÃ³th in TÃ¢rgu_MureÈ, Romania (1911-1913)
    * TrencadÃ­s mosaics in Park_GÃ¼ell by Antoni_GaudÃ­ in Barcelona (1914)
    * Mosaics by Louis_Comfort_Tiffany (1915)
Mosaics were used by many Art Nouveau artists of different movements,
especially of Catalan Modernisme (Hospital_de_Sant_Pau, Palau_de_la_MÃºsica
Catalana, Casa_LleÃ³-Morera and many others). Antoni_GaudÃ­ invented a new
technique in the treatment of materials called trencadÃ­s, which used waste
ceramic pieces.
**** Textiles and wallpaper[edit] ****
    * Silk and wool tapestry design, Cyclamen, by Hermann_Obrist, an early
      example of the "whiplash" motif (1895)
    * Page on the Water Lily, from the book by EugÃ¨ne_Grasset on ornamental
      uses of flowers (1899)
    * Textile design by Koloman_Moser (1899)
    * Printed cotton from the Silver_Studio, for Liberty_department_store, U.K.
      (1904)
    * The Shepherd tapestry by JÃ¡nos_Vaszary (1906) combined Art Nouveau
      motifs and a traditional Hungarian folk theme
    * Victor_Horta, tapis, collection King_Baudouin_Foundation.
Textiles and wallpapers were an important vehicle of Art Nouveau from the
beginning of the style, and an essential element of Art Nouveau interior
design. In Britain, the textile designs of William_Morris had helped launch the
Arts_and_Crafts_Movement and then Art Nouveau. Many designs were created for
the Liberty_department_store in London, which popularized the style throughout
Europe. One such designer was the Silver_Studio, which provided colourful
stylized floral patterns. Other distinctive designs came from Glasgow_School,
and Margaret_Macdonald_Mackintosh. The Glasgow school introduced several
distinctive motifs, including stylized eggs, geometric forms and the "Rose of
Glasgow".
In France, a major contribution was made by designer EugÃ¨ne_Grasset who in
1896 published La Plante et ses applications ornamentales, suggesting Art
Nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants. Many patterns were
designed for and produced by for the major French textile manufacturers in
Mulhouse, Lille and Lyon, by German and Belgian workshops. The German designer
Hermann_Obrist specialized in floral patterns, particularly the cyclamen and
the "whiplash" style based on flower stems, which became a major motif of the
style. The Belgian Henry_van_de_Velde presented a textile work, La VeillÃ©e
d'Anges, at the Salon La Libre EsthÃ©thique in Brussels, inspired by the
symbolism of Paul_Gauguin and of the Nabis. In the Netherlands, textiles were
often inspired by batik patterns from the Dutch colonies in the East_Indies.
Folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries, carpets, embroidery and
textiles in Central Europe and Scandinavia, in the work of Gerhard_Munthe and
Frida_Hansen in Norway. The Five Swans design of Otto_Eckmann appeared in more
than one hundred different versions. The Hungarian designer JÃ¡nos_Vaszary
combined Art Nouveau elements with folkloric themes.[164]
***** Museums[edit] *****
There are 4 types of museums featuring Art Nouveau heritage:
    * Broad-scope museums (not specifically dedicated to Art Nouveau but with
      large collection of items in this style). Art Nouveau monuments are
      italicised,
    * House-museums of Art Nouveau artists (all but Alphose Mucha museum are
      Art Nouveau monuments),
    * Museums dedicated to local Art Nouveau movements (all are Art Nouveau
      monuments).
    * Other Art Nouveau buildings with museum status or featuring a museum
      inside (not dedicated to local Art Nouveau movements/specific artists),

There also are many other Art Nouveau buildings and structures that do not have
museum status but can be officially visited for a fee or unofficially for free
(e.g. railway stations, churches, cafes, restaurants, pubs, hotels, stores,
offices, libraries, cemeteries, fountains as well as numerous apartment
buildings that are still inhabited).

      become disfavoured, was not yet an acceptable study for serious art
      history or a subject suitable for major museum exhibitions and their
