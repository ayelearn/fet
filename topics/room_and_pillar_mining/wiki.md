****** Room and pillar mining ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Room and pillar (variant of breast stoping), is a mining system in which the
mined material is extracted across a horizontal plane, creating horizontal
arrays of rooms and pillars. To do this, "rooms" of ore are dug out while
"pillars" of untouched material are left to support the roof overburden.
Calculating the size, shape, and position of pillars is a complicated
procedure, and is an area of active research.[1] The technique is usually used
for relatively flat-lying deposits, such as those that follow a particular
stratum. Room and pillar mining can be advantageous because it reduces the risk
of surface subsidence compared to other underground mining techniques.[2] It is
also advantageous because it can be mechanized, and is relatively simple.
However, because significant portions of ore may have to be left behind,
recovery and profits can be low.[1] Room and pillar mining was one of the
earliest methods used,[3] although with significantly more man-power.
The room and pillar system is used in mining coal, gypsum,[4] iron,[5] and
uranium[6] ores, particularly when found as manto or blanket deposits, stone
and aggregates, talc, soda_ash and potash.[7] It has been used worldwide from
the Czech Republic[2] to China[8] to the US.[4]

***** Process[edit] *****
**** Stage 1âexploration and development[edit] ****
Planning for the development of room and pillar mines operates in much the same
way as other mining methods,[9] and begins with establishing ownership of the
mine. Following this, the geology of the mine must be analysed, as this will
determine factors like the lifespan of the mine, the production requirements,
and the cost to develop and maintain.[9]
Next, mine layout should be determined, as factors like ventilation, electrical
power, and haulage of the ore must be considered[4][9] in cost analysis. Due to
the non-homogeneous nature of mineral deposits typically mined by room and
pillar, mine layout must be mapped very carefully.[9] It is desirable to keep
the size and shape of rooms and pillars consistent, but some mines strayed from
this formula due to lack of planning and deposit characteristics.[4] Mine
layout includes the size of rooms and pillars in the mines, but also includes
factors like the number and type of entries, roof height, ventilation, and cut
sequence.[9]
*** Mine layout[edit] ***
General Layout or room and pillar mine
Room and pillar mines are developed on a grid basis except where geological
features such as faults require the regular pattern to be modified. The size of
the pillars is determined by calculation. The load-bearing capacity of the
material above and below the material being mined and the capacity of the mined
material will determine the pillar size.[9]
Random mine layout makes ventilation planning difficult, and if the pillars are
too small, there is the risk of pillar failure. In coal mines, pillar failures
are known as squeezes because the roof squeezes down, crushing the pillars.
Once one pillar fails, the weight on the adjacent pillars increases, and the
result is a chain reaction of pillar failures. Once started, such chain
reactions can be extremely difficult to stop, even if they spread slowly.[10]
To prevent this from happening, the mine is divided up into areas or panels.[9]
Pillars known as barrier pillars separate the panels. The barrier pillars are
significantly larger than the "panel" pillars and are sized to allow them to
support a significant part of the panel and prevent progressive collapse of the
mine in the event of failure of the panel pillars.[9]
**** Stage 2âmining[edit] ****
Traditionally, the act of mining consists of three steps. First, the deposit is
"undercut", where a slot is cut as deep as possible along the bottom of a
section of ore. This undercut allows for a manageable pile of rock in later
stages. The second step was the drilling and blasting of the section. This
creates a pile of ore that is loaded and hauled out of the mine—the final step
of the mining process.[9] More modern room and pillar mines use a more
"continuous" method, that uses machinery to simultaneously grind off rock and
move it to the surface.[11]
Other processes, such as backfill, where discarded tailings are unloaded into
mined-out areas,[8] can be used, but are not required. Retreat mining (below)
is an example of a process like this.
*** Retreat mining[edit] ***
Retreat_mining is often the final stage of room and pillar mining. Once a
deposit has been exhausted using this method, the pillars that were left behind
initially are removed, or "pulled", retreating back towards the mine's
entrance. After the pillars are removed, the roof (or back) is allowed to
collapse behind the mining area. Pillar removal must occur in a very precise
order to reduce the risks to workers, owing to the high stresses placed on the
remaining pillars by the abutment stresses of the caving ground.
Retreat mining is a particularly dangerous form of mining. According to the
Mine_Safety_and_Health_Administration (MSHA), pillar recovery mining has been
historically responsible for 25% of American coal mining deaths caused by
failures of the roof or walls, even though it represents only 10% of the coal
mining industry.[12] Retreat mining cannot be used in areas where subsidence is
not acceptable, reducing profitability.[12]
Sometimes retreat mining is not used and the underground space is repurposed as
climate controlled storage or office space instead.[13][14]
**** Stage 3âmaintenance and remediation[edit] ****
Many room and pillar mines have been abandoned for as long as 100 years.[5]
This drastically increases the risk of subsidence unless properly maintained,
[5] however, maintenance does not often occur.[6]
Mention of "environmental stewardship" is often mentioned by mining companies,
but no examples of how this is being done can be found.[9]
***** History[edit] *****
A Maryland coal mine from 1850
Room and pillar mining is one of the oldest mining methods. Early room and
pillar mines were developed more or less at random, with pillar sizes
determined empirically and headings driven in whichever direction was
convenient.[15]
Room and pillar mining was in use throughout Europe as early as the 13th
century,[16] and the United States since the late 18th century. It is still in
use throughout the US,[11] but has slowed or stopped entirely in parts of
Europe.[16]
Coal mining in the United States has nearly always operated with a room and
pillar layout, although originally operated with significantly more man-power.
[9]
Room and pillar mining of gypsum was used in Iowa beginning in 1892, and was
phased out of use in 1927 due to low recovery and development of technologies
that made surface_mining more practical, safe, and cost effective.[4]
***** Modern use[edit] *****
Modern room and pillar mines can be few and far between. This is due to many
factors, including the dangers to miners associated with subsidence, increasing
use of other methods with more mechanization, and the decreasing cost of
surface mining.
**** Advantages[edit] ****
Room and pillar mining is not particularly dependent on the depth of the
deposit. At particularly deep depths, room and pillar mining can be more cost
effective compared to strip mining due to the fact that significantly less
overburden needs to be removed.[8] This means that today, room and pillar
mining is mostly used for high grade, but small, deep deposits.
**** Disadvantages[edit] ****
Due to a recovery rate as low as 40% in some cases,[4] room and pillar mining
cannot compete in terms of profitability with many modern, more mechanized
types of mining such as Longwall or surface.
Abandoned mines have a tendency to collapse. In remote areas, collapses can be
dangerous to wildlife,[17] but subsidence of abandoned mines can be hazardous
to infrastructure above and nearby.[5][16]
