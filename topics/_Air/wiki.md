Composition of Earth's atmosphere by volume. Lower pie represents trace gases
that together compose about 0.043391% of the atmosphere (0.04402961% at April
2019 concentration [2][3]). Numbers are mainly from 2000, with CO
2 and methane from 2019, and do not represent any single source.[4]
The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that
surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's_gravity. The atmosphere
of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid_water
to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar_radiation, warming
the surface through heat retention (greenhouse_effect), and reducing
temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal_temperature_variation).
By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04%
carbon_dioxide, and small amounts of other gases.[8] Air also contains a
variable amount of water_vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4%
over the entire atmosphere. Air composition, temperature, and atmospheric
pressure vary with altitude, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by
terrestrial_plants and breathing of terrestrial_animals is found only in
Earth's troposphere and in artificial_atmospheres.
The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15Ã1018 kg,[9] three quarters of which is
within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes
thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between
the atmosphere and outer_space. The KÃ¡rmÃ¡n_line, at 100 km (62 mi), or 1.57%
of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer
space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric_reentry of
spacecraft at an altitude of around 120 km (75 mi). Several layers can be
distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature
and composition.
The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric_science
(aerology). Early pioneers in the field include LÃ©on_Teisserenc_de_Bort and
Richard_Assmann.[10]

***** Composition *****
Main article: Atmospheric_chemistry
Mean atmospheric water vapor
The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and
argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The
concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from
around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as
5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric
gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).[11] The
remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,[12] among which are the
greenhouse_gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and
ozone. Besides argon, already mentioned, other noble_gases, neon, helium,
krypton, and xenon are also present. Filtered air includes trace amounts of
many other chemical_compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present
in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered
air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and
spores, sea_spray, and volcanic_ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be
present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds),
fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as
hydrogen_sulfide and sulfur_dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources
or from industrial air pollution.

***** Stratification *****
Earth's atmosphere Lower 4 layers of the atmosphere in 3 dimensions as seen
diagonally from above the exobase. Layers drawn to scale, objects within the
layers are not to scale. Aurorae shown here at the bottom of the thermosphere
can actually form at any altitude in this atmospheric layer.
In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere.
However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may
remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see
the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the
temperature/altitude profile, or lapse_rate, is constant and measurable by
means of instrumented balloon_soundings, the temperature behavior provides a
useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's
atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main
layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which
are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[14] From
highest to lowest, the five main layers are:
    * Exosphere: 700 to 10,000 km (440 to 6,200 miles)
    * Thermosphere: 80 to 700 km (50 to 440 miles)[15]
    * Mesosphere: 50 to 80 km (31 to 50 miles)
    * Stratosphere: 12 to 50 km (7 to 31 miles)
    * Troposphere: 0 to 12 km (0 to 7 miles)[16]
**** Exosphere ****
Main article: Exosphere
The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper
limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the
top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700 km above sea level, to
about 10,000 km (6,200 mi; 33,000,000 ft) where it merges into the solar_wind.
This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium
and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide
closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can
travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the
exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape
into space. These free-moving particles follow ballistic_trajectories and may
migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.
The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena
to be possible. However, the aurora_borealis and aurora_australis sometimes
occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the
thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.
**** Thermosphere ****
Main article: Thermosphere
The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends
from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of
about 80 km (50 mi; 260,000 ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of
500â1000 km (310â620 mi; 1,600,000â3,300,000 ft). The height of the
thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.[15] Because
the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also
referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550
kilometres (50 to 342 mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.
The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the
stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the
absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due
to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer
can rise as high as 1500 Â°C (2700 Â°F), though the gas molecules are so far
apart that its temperature_in_the_usual_sense is not very meaningful. The air
is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an
average of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi; 3300 ft) between collisions with other
molecules.[17] Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules
with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because
its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the
skin.
This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-
hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora_borealis and aurora_australis
are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International_Space_Station
orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420 km (220 and 260 mi).
**** Mesosphere ****
Main article: Mesosphere
The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the
region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the
stratopause at an altitude of about 50 km (31 mi; 160,000 ft) to the mesopause
at 80â85 km (50â53 mi; 260,000â280,000 ft) above sea level.
Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top
of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and
has an average temperature around â85 Â°C (â120 Â°F; 190 K).[18][19]
Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water
vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric noctilucent
clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to
the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset
or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when
the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning-induced
discharges known as transient_luminous_events_(TLEs) occasionally form in the
mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer
where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above
Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to
permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding
rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.
**** Stratosphere ****
Main article: Stratosphere
The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies
above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer
extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12 km (7.5 mi; 39,000 ft)
above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55 km
(31 to 34 mi; 164,000 to 180,000 ft).
The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the
pressure at sea_level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of
Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas.
The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing
altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet
radiation (UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone_layer, which restricts
turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be â60 Â°C (â76 Â°F;
210 K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may
be near 0 Â°C.[20]
The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric
conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that
is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost
completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar
stratospheric or nacreous_clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of
this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the
highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.
**** Troposphere ****
Main article: Troposphere
The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from
Earth's surface to an average height of about 12 km (7.5 mi; 39,000 ft),
although this altitude varies from about 9 km (5.6 mi; 30,000 ft) at the
geographic_poles to 17 km (11 mi; 56,000 ft) at the Equator,[16] with some
variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a
boundary marked in most places by a temperature_inversion (i.e. a layer of
relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is
isothermal with height.[21][22]
Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing
altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through
energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere
(i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere.
This promotes vertical mixing (hence, the origin of its name in the Greek word
ÏÏÏÏÎ¿Ï, tropos, meaning "turn"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of
the mass of Earth's atmosphere.[23] The troposphere is denser than all its
overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of
the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of
the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6 km (3.5 mi;
18,000 ft) of the troposphere.
Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so
it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all
the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation,
although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause
from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional
aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that
can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.
Space_Shuttle_Endeavour orbiting in the thermosphere. Because of the angle of
the photo, it appears to straddle the stratosphere and mesosphere that actually
lie more than 250 km below. The orange layer is the troposphere, which gives
way to the whitish stratosphere and then the blue mesosphere.[24]
**** Other layers ****
Within the five principal layers above, that are largely determined by
temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:
    * The ozone_layer is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer ozone
      concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher
      than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main
      components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion
      of the stratosphere from about 15â35 km (9.3â21.7 mi;
      49,000â115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and
      geographically. About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained
      in the stratosphere.
    * The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar
      radiation. It is responsible for auroras. During daytime hours, it
      stretches from 50 to 1,000 km (31 to 621 mi; 160,000 to 3,280,000 ft) and
      includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere.
      However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so
      auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere.
      The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. It has
      practical importance because it influences, for example, radio
      propagation on Earth.
    * The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric
      gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the
      troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the
      thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not
      depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence.[25]
      This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about
      100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the very edge_of_space itself as accepted by
      the FAI, which places it about 20 km (12 mi; 66,000 ft) above the
      mesopause.
      Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere
      and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with
      altitude. This is because the distance_that_particles_can_move_without
      colliding_with_one_another is large compared with the size of motions
      that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight,
      with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the
      bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is
      composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.
      [clarification_needed]
    * The planetary_boundary_layer is the part of the troposphere that is
      closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through
      turbulent_diffusion. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually
      is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or
      intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges
      from as little as about 100 metres (330 ft) on clear, calm nights to
      3,000 m (9,800 ft) or more during the afternoon in dry regions.
The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14 Â°C (57 Â°F;
287 K)[26] or 15 Â°C (59 Â°F; 288 K),[27] depending on the reference.[28][29]

***** Physical properties *****
Comparison of the 1962 US_Standard_Atmosphere graph of geometric_altitude
against air_density, pressure, the speed_of_sound and temperature with
approximate altitudes of various objects.[31]
**** Pressure and thickness ****
Main article: Atmospheric_pressure
The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International
Standard_Atmosphere as 101325 pascals (760.00 Torr; 14.6959 psi; 760.00 mmHg).
This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard_atmospheres_(atm). Total
atmospheric mass is 5.1480Ã1018 kg (1.135Ã1019 lb),[32] about 2.5% less than
would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of
51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous
terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at
the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with
location and weather.
If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density equal to sea level
density (about 1.2 kg per m3) from sea level upwards, it would terminate
abruptly at an altitude of 8.50 km (27,900 ft). It actually decreases
exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6 km (18,000 ft) or by a
factor of 1/e every 7.64 km (25,100 ft), the average scale_height of the
atmosphere below 70 km (43 mi; 230,000 ft). However, the atmosphere is more
accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes
gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity
into account.
In summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as
follows:[33]
    * 50% is below 5.6 km (18,000 ft).
    * 90% is below 16 km (52,000 ft).
    * 99.99997% is below 100 km (62 mi; 330,000 ft), the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n_line. By
      international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human
      travelers are considered astronauts.
By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at 8,848 m (29,029 ft); commercial
airliners typically cruise between 10 and 13 km (33,000 and 43,000 ft) where
the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather_balloons reach 30.4 km
(100,000 ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0 km
(354,300 ft).
Even above the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras
still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may
not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's
ionosphere, important to HF_radio propagation, begin below 100 km and extend
beyond 500 km. By comparison, the International_Space_Station and Space_Shuttle
typically orbit at 350â400 km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where
they encounter enough atmospheric_drag to require reboosts every few months.
Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric
drag at altitudes as high as 700â800 km.
**** Temperature and speed of sound ****
Main articles: Atmospheric_temperature and Speed_of_sound
Temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured between
January 1979 and December 2005 by Microwave_Sounding_Units and Advanced
Microwave_Sounding_Units on NOAA weather satellites. The instruments record
microwaves emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Source:[34]
The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature
is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level,
but variations in this trend begin above 11 km, where the temperature
stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the
troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about 20 km, the temperature
increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture
of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas
in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude
occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90 km.
Because in an ideal_gas of constant composition the speed_of_sound depends only
on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in
the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature
profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal
changes in density or pressure.
**** Density and mass ****
Temperature and mass density against altitude from the NRLMSISE-00 standard
atmosphere model (the eight dotted lines in each "decade" are at the eight
cubes 8, 27, 64, ..., 729)
Main article: Density_of_air
The density of air at sea level is about 1.2 kg/m3 (1.2 g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3).
Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of
temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form
of the ideal_gas_law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases.
This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric_formula. More
sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.
The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5Ã1015) tonnes or
1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National_Center_for
Atmospheric_Research, "The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480Ã1018 kg
with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5Ã1015 kg, depending on
whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than
the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as
1.27Ã1016 kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 Â±0.0003Ã1018 kg."

See also: Sunlight
Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth
also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot
see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the
atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting
satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected_light from ice
crystals in the atmosphere.[35][36]
**** Scattering ****
Main article: Atmospheric_scattering
When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through
scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called
direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun.
Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For
example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct
radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a
phenomenon called Rayleigh_scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more
easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are
seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun
is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than
normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out,
leaving the red light in a sunset.
**** Absorption ****
Main article: Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)
Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) to various
wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including visible_light.
Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O2
and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers. Water (H2O)
absorbs many wavelengths above 700 nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it
increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the
atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.
The combined absorption_spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave "windows"
of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The
optical_window runs from around 300 nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans
can see, the visible_spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400â700 nm
and continues to the infrared to around 1100 nm. There are also infrared and
radio_windows that transmit some infrared and radio_waves at longer
wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to
about eleven-meter waves.
**** Emission ****
Further information: Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)
Emission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation.
Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their
"black_body" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more
radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with
longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000 K (5,730 Â°C;
10,340 Â°F), its radiation peaks near 500 nm, and is visible to the human eye.
Earth is approximately 290 K (17 Â°C; 62 Â°F), so its radiation peaks near
10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.
Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For
example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy
nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of
infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher
elevations.
The greenhouse_effect is directly related to this absorption and emission
effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do
not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these
are CO
2 and H2O.
**** Refractive index ****
Main article: Atmospheric_refraction
See also: Scintillation_(astronomy)
The refractive_index of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic
variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long
optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard
ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in
the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.
The refractive index of air depends on temperature,[37] giving rise to
refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such
effects is the mirage.
***** Circulation *****
Main article: Atmospheric_circulation
An idealised view of three large circulation cells.
Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the
troposphere, and the means (with ocean_circulation) by which heat is
distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric
circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly
constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference
in solar radiation between the equator and poles.
***** Evolution of Earth's atmosphere *****
See also: History_of_Earth and Paleoclimatology
**** Earliest atmosphere ****
The first_atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar_nebula, primarily
hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the
gas_giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.[38]
**** Second atmosphere ****
Outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late_heavy
bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere,
consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon_dioxide and inert gases.[38] A major
part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals
such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form
carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water-related sediments have been
found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.[39]
About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable
"second atmosphere". The influence of life has to be taken into account rather
soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear
as early as 3.5 billion years ago.[40] How Earth at that time maintained a
climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30%
lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the "faint_young_Sun
paradox".
The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during
the complete early temperature_record of Earth â with the exception of one
cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an
oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by
photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great_Oxygenation_Event), which have been
found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic
carbon isotopy (isotope_ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar
to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon_cycle became
established as early as 4 billion years ago.
Ancient_sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080
million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution.
These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi_carbon
isotope_excursion.[41]
**** Third atmosphere ****
Oxygen content of the atmosphere over the last billion years[42][43]
The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate_tectonics influences the
long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and
from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the
atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great_Oxygenation_Event
and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded_iron_formations.
Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by
oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not
start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen
began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen.
This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing
atmosphere. O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more
than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.[44] The following time span from 541
million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the
earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen-requiring metazoan life forms
began to appear.
The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million
years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly
higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere:
Plants use_carbon_dioxide_from_the_atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of
pyrite and volcanic_eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which
oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However,
volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to
oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the
atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are
associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21%
oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.[45]
**** Air pollution ****
Main article: Air_pollution
Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate
matter or biological_materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms.[46]
Stratospheric ozone_depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from
chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.
The scientific_consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently
accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global_warming.[47]
[File:Watching the Earth Breathe.ogv]Play_media
Animation shows the buildup of tropospheric CO
2 in the Northern Hemisphere with a maximum around May. The maximum in the
vegetation cycle follows in the late summer. Following the peak in vegetation,
the drawdown of atmospheric CO
2 due to photosynthesis is apparent, particularly over the boreal_forests.
***** Images from space *****
Main article: Weather_satellite
On October 19, 2015 NASA started a website containing daily images of the full
sunlit side of Earth on http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The images are taken from
the Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory (DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during
a day.[48]
    * Blue_light_is_scattered_more than other wavelengths by the gases in the
      atmosphere, giving Earth a blue halo when seen from space.
    * The geomagnetic_storms cause displays of aurora across the atmosphere.
    * Limb view, of Earth's atmosphere. Colors roughly denote the layers of the
      atmosphere.
    * This image shows the Moon at the centre, with the limb of Earth near the
      bottom transitioning into the orange-colored troposphere. The troposphere
      ends abruptly at the tropopause, which appears in the image as the sharp
      boundary between the orange- and blue-colored atmosphere. The silvery-
      blue noctilucent_clouds extend far above Earth's troposphere.
