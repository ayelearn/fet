Degenerate matter[1] is a highly dense state of fermionic matter in which
particles must occupy high states of kinetic energy to satisfy the Pauli
exclusion_principle. The description applies to matter composed of electrons,
protons, neutrons or other fermions. The term is mainly used in astrophysics to
refer to dense stellar objects where gravitational pressure is so extreme that
quantum_mechanical effects are significant. This type of matter is naturally
found in stars in their final evolutionary states, like white_dwarfs and
neutron_stars, where thermal pressure alone is not enough to avoid
gravitational collapse.
Degenerate matter is usually modelled as an ideal Fermi_gas, an ensemble of
non-interacting fermions. In a quantum mechanical description, particles
limited to a finite volume may take only a discrete set of energies, called
quantum_states. The Pauli_exclusion_principle prevents identical fermions from
occupying the same quantum state. At lowest total energy (when the thermal
energy of the particles is negligible), all the lowest energy quantum states
are filled. This state is referred to as full degeneracy. This degeneracy
pressure remains non-zero even at absolute zero temperature.[2][3] Adding
particles or reducing the volume forces the particles into higher-energy
quantum states. In this situation, a compression force is required, and is made
manifest as a resisting pressure. The key feature is that this degeneracy
pressure does not depend on the temperature but only on the density of the
fermions. Degeneracy pressure keeps dense stars in equilibrium, independent of
the thermal structure of the star.
A degenerate mass whose fermions have velocities close to the speed of light
(particle energy larger than its rest_mass_energy) is called relativistic
degenerate matter.
The concept of degenerate stars, stellar objects composed of degenerate matter,
was originally developed in a joint effort between Arthur_Eddington, Ralph
Fowler and Arthur_Milne. Eddington had suggested that the atoms in Sirius_B
were almost completely ionised and closely packed. Fowler described white
dwarfs as composed of a gas of particles that became degenerate at low
temperature. Milne proposed that degenerate matter is found in most of the
nuclei of stars, not only in compact_stars.[4][5]

***** Concept[edit] *****
Main article: Fermi_gas
If a plasma is cooled and under increasing pressure, it will eventually not be
possible to compress the plasma any further. This constraint is due to the
Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two fermions cannot share the same
quantum state. When in this highly compressed state, since there is no extra
space for any particles, a particle's location is extremely defined. Since the
locations of the particles of a highly compressed plasma have very low
uncertainty, their momentum is extremely uncertain. The Heisenberg uncertainty
principle states
         &#x0394; p &#x0394; x &#x2265;   &#x210F; 2     {\displaystyle \Delta
      p\Delta x\geq {\frac {\hbar }{2}}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta p\Delta x\geq
      {\frac {\hbar }{2}}}],
where Îp is the uncertainty in the particle's momentum and Îx is the
uncertainty in position. Therefore, even though the plasma is cold, such
particles must on average be moving very fast. Large kinetic energies lead to
the conclusion that, in order to compress an object into a very small space,
tremendous force is required to control its particles' momentum.
Unlike a classical ideal_gas, whose pressure is proportional to its temperature
         P V = N  k   B    T   {\displaystyle PV=Nk_{\rm {B}}T}  [
      {\displaystyle PV=Nk_{\rm {B}}T}],
where P is pressure, V is the volume, N is the number of particlesâtypically
atoms or moleculesâkB is Boltzmann's_constant, and T is temperature), the
pressure exerted by degenerate matter depends only weakly on its temperature.
In particular, the pressure remains nonzero even at absolute_zero temperature.
At relatively low densities, the pressure of a fully degenerate gas can be
derived by treating the system as an ideal Fermi gas, in this way
         P = K   (   N V   )   5  /  3     {\displaystyle P=K\left({\frac {N}
      {V}}\right)^{5/3}}  [{\displaystyle P=K\left({\frac {N}{V}}\right)^{5/
      3}}],
where K depends on the properties of the particles making up the gas. At very
high densities, where most of the particles are forced into quantum states with
relativistic_energies, the pressure is given by
         P = K   (   N V   )   4  /  3     {\displaystyle P=K\left({\frac {N}
      {V}}\right)^{4/3}}  [{\displaystyle P=K\left({\frac {N}{V}}\right)^{4/
      3}}],
where K again depends on the properties of the particles making up the gas.[6]
All matter experiences both normal thermal pressure and degeneracy pressure,
but in commonly encountered gases, thermal pressure dominates so much that
degeneracy pressure can be ignored. Likewise, degenerate matter still has
normal thermal pressure, but at extremely high densities, the degeneracy
pressure usually dominates.
Exotic examples of degenerate matter include neutron degenerate matter, strange
matter, metallic_hydrogen and white dwarf matter. Degeneracy pressure
contributes to the pressure of conventional solids, but these are not usually
considered to be degenerate matter because a significant contribution to their
pressure is provided by electrical repulsion of atomic_nuclei and the screening
of nuclei from each other by electrons. In metals it is useful to treat the
conduction electrons alone as a degenerate free_electron_gas, while the
majority of the electrons are regarded as occupying bound quantum states. This
solid state contrasts with degenerate matter that forms the body of a white
dwarf, where most of the electrons would be treated as occupying free particle
momentum states.
***** Degenerate gases[edit] *****
Degenerate gases are gases composed of fermions such as electrons, protons, and
neutrons rather than molecules of ordinary matter. The electron gas in ordinary
metals and in the interior of white dwarfs are two examples. Following the
Pauli exclusion principle, there can be only one fermion occupying each quantum
state. In a degenerate gas, all quantum states are filled up to the Fermi
energy. Most stars are supported against their own gravitation by normal
thermal gas pressure, while in white dwarf stars the supporting force comes
from the degeneracy pressure of the electron gas in their interior. In neutron
stars, the degenerate particles are neutrons.
A fermion gas in which all quantum states below a given energy level are filled
is called a fully degenerate fermion gas. The difference between this energy
level and the lowest energy level is known as the Fermi energy.
**** Electron degeneracy[edit] ****
Main article: Electron_degeneracy_pressure
In an ordinary fermion gas in which thermal effects dominate, most of the
available electron energy levels are unfilled and the electrons are free to
move to these states. As particle density is increased, electrons progressively
fill the lower energy states and additional electrons are forced to occupy
states of higher energy even at low temperatures. Degenerate gases strongly
resist further compression because the electrons cannot move to already filled
lower energy levels due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Since electrons
cannot give up energy by moving to lower energy states, no thermal energy can
be extracted. The momentum of the fermions in the fermion gas nevertheless
generates pressure, termed 'degeneracy pressure'.
Under high densities the matter becomes a degenerate gas when the electrons are
all stripped from their parent atoms. In the core of a star, once hydrogen
burning in nuclear_fusion reactions stops, it becomes a collection of
positively charged ions, largely helium and carbon nuclei, floating in a sea of
electrons, which have been stripped from the nuclei. Degenerate gas is an
almost perfect conductor of heat and does not obey the ordinary gas laws. White
dwarfs are luminous not because they are generating any energy but rather
because they have trapped a large amount of heat which is gradually radiated
away. Normal gas exerts higher pressure when it is heated and expands, but the
pressure in a degenerate gas does not depend on the temperature. When gas
becomes super-compressed, particles position right up against each other to
produce degenerate gas that behaves more like a solid. In degenerate gases the
kinetic_energies of electrons are quite high and the rate of collision between
electrons and other particles is quite low, therefore degenerate electrons can
travel great distances at velocities that approach the speed of light. Instead
of temperature, the pressure in a degenerate gas depends only on the speed of
the degenerate particles; however, adding heat does not increase the speed of
most of the electrons, because they are stuck in fully occupied quantum states.
Pressure is increased only by the mass of the particles, which increases the
gravitational force pulling the particles closer together. Therefore, the
phenomenon is the opposite of that normally found in matter where if the mass
of the matter is increased, the object becomes bigger. In degenerate gas, when
the mass is increased, the pressure is increased, and the particles become
spaced closer together, so the object becomes smaller. Degenerate gas can be
compressed to very high densities, typical values being in the range of 10,000
kilograms per cubic centimeter.
There is an upper limit to the mass of an electron-degenerate object, the
Chandrasekhar_limit, beyond which electron_degeneracy_pressure cannot support
the object against collapse. The limit is approximately 1.44[7] solar_masses
for objects with typical compositions expected for white dwarf stars (carbon
and oxygen with 2 baryons per electron). This mass cutoff is appropriate only
for a star supported by ideal electron degeneracy pressure under Newtonian
gravity; in general_relativity and with realistic Coulomb corrections, the
corresponding mass limit is around 1.38 solar masses.[8] The limit may also
change with the chemical composition of the object, as it affects the ratio of
mass to number of electrons present. The object's rotation, which counteracts
the gravitational force, also changes the limit for any particular object.
Celestial objects below this limit are white_dwarf stars, formed by the gradual
shrinking of the cores of stars that run out of fuel. During this shrinking, an
electron-degenerate gas forms in the core, providing sufficient degeneracy
pressure as it is compressed to resist further collapse. Above this mass limit,
a neutron_star (partially supported by neutron degeneracy pressure) or a black
hole may be formed instead.
**** Neutron degeneracy[edit] ****
Neutron degeneracy is analogous to electron degeneracy and is demonstrated in
neutron stars, which are partially supported by the pressure from a degenerate
neutron gas.[9] The collapse may happen when the core of a white dwarf is above
the vicinity of 1.4 solar_masses, which is the Chandrasekhar limit, and the
collapse is not halted by the pressure of degenerate electrons. As the star
collapses, the Fermi energy of the electrons increases to the point where it is
energetically favorable for them to combine with protons to produce neutrons
(via inverse beta_decay, also termed electron_capture and "neutronization").
The result is an extremely compact star composed of nuclear_matter, which is
predominantly a degenerate neutron gas, sometimes called neutronium, with a
small admixture of degenerate proton and electron gases (and at higher
densities, muons).
Neutrons in a degenerate neutron gas are spaced much more closely than
electrons in an electron-degenerate gas because the more massive neutron has a
much shorter wavelength at a given energy. Typical separations are comparable
with the size of the neutron and the range of the strong nuclear force, and it
is actually the repulsive nature of the latter at small separations that
primarily supports neutron stars more massive than 0.7 solar masses (which
includes all measured neutron stars). In the case of neutron stars and white
dwarfs, this phenomenon is compounded by the fact that the pressures within
neutron stars are much higher than those in white dwarfs. The pressure increase
is caused by the fact that the compactness of a neutron star causes
gravitational forces to be much higher than in a less compact body with similar
mass. The result is a star with a diameter on the order of a thousandth that of
a white dwarf.
There is an upper limit to the mass of a neutron-degenerate object, the
TolmanâOppenheimerâVolkoff_limit, which is analogous to the Chandrasekhar
limit for electron-degenerate objects. The limit for objects supported by ideal
neutron degeneracy pressure is only 0.75 solar masses.[10] For more realistic
models including baryon interaction, the precise limit is unknown, as it
depends on the equations_of_state of nuclear matter, for which a highly
accurate model is not yet available. Above this limit, a neutron star may
collapse into a black hole or into other, denser forms of degenerate matter
(such as quark_matter) if these forms exist and have suitable properties
(mainly related to degree of compressibility, or "stiffness", described by the
equations of state).
**** Proton degeneracy[edit] ****
Sufficiently dense matter containing protons experiences proton degeneracy
pressure, in a manner similar to the electron degeneracy pressure in electron-
degenerate matter: protons confined to a sufficiently small volume have a large
uncertainty in their momentum due to the Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle.
However, because protons are much more massive than electrons, the same
momentum represents a much smaller velocity for protons than for electrons. As
a result, in matter with approximately equal numbers of protons and electrons,
proton degeneracy pressure is much smaller than electron degeneracy pressure,
and proton degeneracy is usually modelled as a correction to the equations_of
state of electron-degenerate matter.
**** Quark degeneracy[edit] ****
At densities greater than those supported by neutron degeneracy, quark_matter
is expected to occur.[citation_needed] Several variations of this hypothesis
have been proposed that represent quark-degenerate states. Strange_matter is a
degenerate gas of quarks that is often assumed to contain strange_quarks in
addition to the usual up and down quarks. Color_superconductor materials are
degenerate gases of quarks in which quarks pair up in a manner similar to
Cooper_pairing in electrical superconductors. The equations of state for the
various proposed forms of quark-degenerate matter vary widely, and are usually
also poorly defined, due to the difficulty of modeling strong_force
interactions.
Quark-degenerate matter may occur in the cores of neutron stars, depending on
the equations of state of neutron-degenerate matter. It may also occur in
hypothetical quark_stars, formed by the collapse of objects above the
TolmanâOppenheimerâVolkoff_mass_limit for neutron-degenerate objects.
Whether quark-degenerate matter forms at all in these situations depends on the
equations of state of both neutron-degenerate matter and quark-degenerate
matter, both of which are poorly known. Quark stars are considered to be an
intermediate category among neutron stars and black holes.[citation_needed]

At densities greater than those supported by any degeneracy, gravity overwhelms
all other forces. The stellar body collapses to form a black_hole, though this
is not well modeled by quantum mechanics. At the same time, the material must
be converted from fermions, which are subject to degeneracy pressure, to
bosons, which are not. A current hypothesis[whose?] suggest gluons as the most
likely boson thought possible.
In the frame_of_reference that is co-moving with the collapsing matter, general
relativity models without quantum_mechanics have all the matter ending up in an
infinitely dense singularity at the center of the event_horizon. (If one uses
the UFT EinsteinâMaxwellâDirac_system or its generalizations, then the
singularity is avoided and one ends up with a quark star, possibly surrounded
by an event horizon.) It is a general result of quantum mechanics that no
fermion can be confined in a space smaller than its own wavelength, making such
a singularity impossible, unless only bosons are present, but there is no
widely accepted theory that combines general relativity and quantum mechanics
sufficiently to tell us what the structure inside a black hole might be. If
bosons can be conclusively ruled out, one possible theory is that constituent
particles decompose into strings, forming a structure called a fuzzball.
