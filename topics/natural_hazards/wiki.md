This article is about the natural hazards that might lead to disasters. For
natural disasters, see natural_disaster.
A natural hazard[1] is a natural_phenomenon that might have a negative effect
on humans or the environment. Natural hazard events can be classified into two
broad categories:[2] geophysical and biological. Geophysical hazards[3][4]
encompass geological and meteorological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, wildfires, cyclonic_storms, floods, droughts, avalanches and
landslides. Biological_hazards can refer to a diverse array of disease,
infection, infestation and invasive_species.
Many geophysical hazards are related;[5] for example, submarine_earthquakes can
cause tsunamis, and hurricanes can lead to coastal_flooding and erosion. Floods
and wildfires can result from a combination of geological, hydrological, and
climatic factors. It is possible that some natural hazards are intertemporally
correlated as well.[5][6] An example of the distinction between a natural
hazard and a natural_disaster is that the 1906_San_Francisco_earthquake was a
disaster, whereas living on a fault line is a hazard. Some natural hazards can
be provoked or affected by anthropogenic_processes (e.g. land-use change,
drainage and construction).[7]

***** Geological hazards[edit] *****
Main article: Geohazard
**** Avalanche[edit] ****
An avalanche occurs when a large snow (or rock) mass slides down a
mountainside.[8] An avalanche is an example of a gravity current consisting of
granular material. In an avalanche, lots of material or mixtures of different
types of material fall or slide rapidly under the force of gravity. Avalanches
are often classified by the size or severity of consequences resulting from the
event.[9]
**** Earthquake[edit] ****
See also: Lists_of_earthquakes and Soil_liquefaction
San_Francisco was devastated by an earthquake in 1906
An earthquake is the sudden release of energy stored as lithospheric stress
that radiates seismic_waves. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes may manifest
with a shaking or displacement of the ground; when the earthquake occurs on the
seafloor, the resulting displacement of water can sometimes result in a
tsunami. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take
place in the 40,000-km-long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific
seismic belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part
bounds the Pacific_Plate.[10] Many earthquakes happen each day, few of which
are large enough to cause significant damage.
**** Coastal erosion[edit] ****
Coastal_erosion is a physical process by which shorelines in coastal areas
around the world shift and change, primarily in response to waves and currents
that can be influenced by tides and storm surge.[11] Coastal erosion can result
from long-term processes (see also beach_evolution) as well as from episodic
events such as tropical_cyclones or other severe storm events.
**** Lahar[edit] ****
A lahar is a type of natural event closely related to a volcanic_eruption, and
involves a large amount of material originating from an eruption of a glaciated
volcano, including mud from the melted ice, rock, and ash sliding down the side
of the volcano at a rapid pace. These flows can destroy entire towns in seconds
and kill thousands of people, and form flood_basalt. This is based on natural
events.
**** Landslide[edit] ****
A landslide is a mass displacement of sediment, usually down a slope. It can be
caused by pressure pulling natural objects down a declining hill.[12]
**** Sinkhole[edit] ****
A sinkhole is a localized depression in the surface topography, usually caused
by the collapse of a subterranean structure such as a cave. Although rare,
large sinkholes that develop suddenly in populated areas can lead to the
collapse of buildings and other structures.
**** Volcanic eruption[edit] ****
PuÊ»u_Ê»ÅÊ»Å
A volcanic_eruption is the point in which a volcano is active and releases its
power, and the eruptions come in many forms. They range from daily small
eruptions which occur in places like Kilauea in Hawaii, to megacolossal
eruptions (where the volcano expels at least 1,000 cubic kilometers of
material) from supervolcanoes like Lake_Taupo (26,500 years ago) and
Yellowstone_Caldera. According to the Toba_catastrophe_theory, 70 to 75
thousand years ago, a supervolcanic event at Lake_Toba reduced the human
population to 10,000 or even 1,000 breeding pairs, creating a bottleneck in
human_evolution. Some eruptions form pyroclastic_flows, which are high-
temperature clouds of ash and steam that can travel down mountainsides at speed
exceeding an airliner.
***** Meteorological or climate hazards[edit] *****

**** Blizzard[edit] ****
A blizzard is a severe winter storm with icy and windy conditions characterized
by low temperature, strong wind and heavy snow.
**** Drought[edit] ****
A drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region,
resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric,
surface water or ground water. Scientists warn that global_warming and climate
change may result in more extensive droughts in coming years. These extensive
droughts are likely to occur within the African continent due to its very low
precipitation levels and high temperatures.
**** Hailstorm[edit] ****
A hailstorm is a natural hazard where a thunderstorm produces numerous
hailstones which damage the location in which they fall. Hailstorms can be
especially devastating to farm fields, ruining crops and damaging equipment.
**** Heat wave[edit] ****
A heat_wave is a hazard characterized by heat which is considered extreme and
unusual in the area in which it occurs. Heat waves are rare and require
specific combinations of weather events to take place, and may include
temperature_inversions, katabatic_winds, or other phenomena. There is potential
for longer-term events causing global_warming, including stadial events (the
opposite to glacial "ice age" events), or through human-induced climatic
warming.
**** Cyclonic storm[edit] ****
Cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low
atmospheric pressure.
Hurricane_Katrina
Hurricane, tropical_cyclone, and typhoon are different names for the cyclonic
storm system that forms over the oceans. It is caused by evaporated water that
comes off of the ocean and becomes a storm. The Coriolis_effect causes the
storms to spin.74 mph (119 km/h). Hurricane is used for these phenomena in the
Atlantic and eastern Pacific_Oceans, tropical cyclone in the Indian, and
typhoon in the western Pacific.
**** Ice storm[edit] ****
An ice_storm is a particular weather event in which precipitation falls as ice,
due to atmosphere conditions. It causes damage.
**** Tornado[edit] ****
A tornado is a natural disaster resulting from a thunderstorm. Tornadoes are
violent, rotating columns of air which can blow at speeds between 50 mph
(80 km/h) and 300 mph (480 km/h), and possibly higher. Tornadoes can occur one
at a time, or can occur in large tornado_outbreaks associated with supercells
or in other large areas of thunderstorm development. Waterspouts are tornadoes
occurring over tropical waters in light rain conditions.
**** Climate change[edit] ****
Climate_change can increase or decrease weather hazards, and also directly
endanger property due to sea_level_rise and biological organisms due to habitat
destruction.
**** Geomagnetic storm[edit] ****
Geomagnetic_storms can disrupt or damage technological infrastructure, and
disorient species with magnetoception.
***** Flood[edit] *****
A flood results from an overflow of water beyond its normal confines of a body
of water such as a lake, or the accumulation of water over land areas.[13]
***** Wildfire[edit] *****
Wildfire is a fire that burns in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner.
Wildfires can result from natural occurrences such as lightning strikes or from
human activity.[14] These occur without any warning
***** Disease[edit] *****
Disease is a natural hazard that can be enhanced by human factors such as
urbanization or poor sanitation. Disease affecting multiple people can be
termed an outbreak or epidemic.
In some cases, a hazard exists in that a human-made defense against disease
could fail, for example through antibiotic_resistance.
***** Multi-hazard analysis[edit] *****
Each of the natural hazard types outlined above have very different
characteristics, in terms of the spatial and temporal scales they influence,
hazard frequency and return_period, and measures of intensity and impact. These
complexities result in "single-hazard" assessments being commonplace, where the
hazard potential from one particular hazard type is constrained. In these
examples, hazards are often treated as isolated or independent. An alternative
is a "multi-hazard" approach which seeks to identify all possible natural
hazards and their interactions or interrelationships.[15][5]
Many examples exist of one natural hazard triggering or increasing the
probability of one or more other natural hazards. For example, an earthquake
may trigger landslides, whereas a wildfire may increase the probability of
landslides being generated in the future.[5] A detailed review of such
interactions across 21 natural hazards identified 90 possible interactions, of
varying likelihood and spatial importance.[5] There may also be interactions
between these natural hazards and anthropic processes.[16] For example,
groundwater abstraction may trigger groundwater-related_subsidence.[17]
Effective hazard_analysis in any given area (e.g., for the purposes of disaster
risk_reduction) should ideally include an examination of all relevant hazards
and their interactions. To be of most use for risk reduction, hazard analysis
should be extended to risk_assessment wherein the vulnerability of the built
environment to each of the hazards is taken into account. This step is well
developed for seismic_risk, where the possible effect of future earthquakes on
structures and infrastructure is assessed, as well as for risk from extreme
wind and to a lesser extent flood_risk. For other types of natural hazard the
calculation of risk is more challenging, principally because of the lack of
functions linking the intensity of a hazard and the probability of different
levels of damage (fragility curves).[18] ThinkHazard! is an online tool that
provides an overview of the hazards from eight natural hazards (river floods,
earthquakes, water_scarcity, cyclones, coastal floods, tsunamis, volcanoes and
landslides) developed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and
Recovery in partnership with other institutions.[19][20]
***** International campaigns[edit] *****
In 2000, the United_Nations launched the International_Early_Warning_Programme
to address the underlying causes of vulnerability and to build disaster-
resilient communities by promoting increased awareness of the importance of
disaster_risk_reduction as an integral component of sustainable_development,
with the goal of reducing human, economic and environmental losses due to
hazards of all kinds (UN/ISDR, 2000).
The 2006-2007 United Nations International Disaster Reduction Day theme was
âDisaster reduction education begins in schoolâ. The Foundation of Public
Safety Professionals launched an international campaign with an international
open essay or documentary competition.[citation_needed]
