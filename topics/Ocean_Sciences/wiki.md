Oceanography (compound of the Greek words á½ ÎºÎµÎ±Î½ÏÏ meaning "ocean" and
Î³ÏÎ¬ÏÏ meaning "write"), also known as oceanology, is the study of the
physical and biological aspects of the ocean. It is an important Earth_science,
which covers a wide range of topics, including ecosystem dynamics; ocean
currents, waves, and geophysical_fluid_dynamics; plate_tectonics and the
geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and
physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse
topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further
knowledge of the world_ocean and understanding of processes within: astronomy,
biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and
physics. Paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in the geologic
past.

***** History[edit] *****

**** Early history[edit] ****
Humans first acquired knowledge of the waves and currents of the seas and
oceans in pre-historic times. Observations on tides were recorded by Aristotle
and Strabo. Early exploration of the oceans was primarily for cartography and
mainly limited to its surfaces and of the animals that fishermen brought up in
nets, though depth soundings by lead line were taken.
Although Juan_Ponce_de_LeÃ³n in 1513 first identified the Gulf_Stream, and the
current was well known to mariners, Benjamin_Franklin made the first scientific
study of it and gave it its name. Franklin measured water temperatures during
several Atlantic crossings and correctly explained the Gulf Stream's cause.
Franklin and Timothy Folger printed the first map of the Gulf Stream in
1769â1770.[1][2]
1799 map of the currents in the Atlantic and Indian_Oceans, by James_Rennell
Information on the currents of the Pacific_Ocean was gathered by explorers of
the late 18th century, including James_Cook and Louis_Antoine_de_Bougainville.
James_Rennell wrote the first scientific textbooks on oceanography, detailing
the current flows of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. During a voyage around the
Cape_of_Good_Hope in 1777, he mapped "the banks_and_currents_at_the_Lagullas".
He was also the first to understand the nature of the intermittent current near
the Isles_of_Scilly, (now known as Rennell's_Current).[3]
Sir James_Clark_Ross took the first modern sounding in deep sea in 1840, and
Charles_Darwin published a paper on reefs and the formation of atolls as a
result of the second_voyage_of_HMS_Beagle in 1831â1836. Robert_FitzRoy
published a four-volume report of Beagle's three voyages. In 1841â1842 Edward
Forbes undertook dredging in the Aegean_Sea that founded marine ecology.
The first superintendent of the United_States_Naval_Observatory (1842â1861),
Matthew_Fontaine_Maury devoted his time to the study of marine meteorology,
navigation, and charting prevailing winds and currents. His 1855 textbook
Physical Geography of the Sea was one of the first comprehensive oceanography
studies. Many nations sent oceanographic observations to Maury at the Naval
Observatory, where he and his colleagues evaluated the information and
distributed the results worldwide.[4]
**** Modern oceanography[edit] ****
Despite all this, human knowledge of the oceans remained confined to the
topmost few fathoms of the water and a small amount of the bottom, mainly in
shallow areas. Almost nothing was known of the ocean depths. The British Royal
Navy's efforts to chart all of the world's coastlines in the mid-19th century
reinforced the vague idea that most of the ocean was very deep, although little
more was known. As exploration ignited both popular and scientific interest in
the polar regions and Africa, so too did the mysteries of the unexplored
oceans.
HMS Challenger undertook the first global marine research expedition in 1872.
The seminal event in the founding of the modern science of oceanography was the
1872â1876 Challenger_expedition. As the first true oceanographic cruise, this
expedition laid the groundwork for an entire academic and research discipline.
[5] In response to a recommendation from the Royal_Society, the British
Government announced in 1871 an expedition to explore world's oceans and
conduct appropriate scientific investigation. Charles_Wyville_Thompson and Sir
John_Murray launched the Challenger expedition. Challenger, leased from the
Royal Navy, was modified for scientific work and equipped with separate
laboratories for natural_history and chemistry.[6] Under the scientific
supervision of Thomson, Challenger travelled nearly 70,000 nautical miles
(130,000 km) surveying and exploring. On her journey circumnavigating the
globe,[6] 492 deep sea soundings, 133 bottom dredges, 151 open water trawls and
263 serial water temperature observations were taken.[7] Around 4,700 new
species of marine life were discovered. The result was the Report Of The
Scientific Results of the Exploring Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the
years 1873â76. Murray, who supervised the publication, described the report
as "the greatest advance in the knowledge of our planet since the celebrated
discoveries of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries". He went on to found the
academic discipline of oceanography at the University_of_Edinburgh, which
remained the centre for oceanographic research well into the 20th century.[8]
Murray was the first to study marine trenches and in particular the Mid-
Atlantic_Ridge, and map the sedimentary deposits in the oceans. He tried to map
out the world's ocean currents based on salinity and temperature observations,
and was the first to correctly understand the nature of coral_reef development.
In the late 19th century, other Western nations also sent out scientific
expeditions (as did private individuals and institutions). The first purpose
built oceanographic ship, Albatros, was built in 1882. In 1893, Fridtjof_Nansen
allowed his ship, Fram, to be frozen in the Arctic ice. This enabled him to
obtain oceanographic, meteorological and astronomical data at a stationary spot
over an extended period.
Ocean_currents (1911)
In 1881 the geographer John_Francon_Williams published a seminal book,
Geography of the Oceans.[9][10] Between 1907 and 1911 Otto_KrÃ¼mmel published
the Handbuch der Ozeanographie, which became influential in awakening public
interest in oceanography.[11] The four-month 1910 North Atlantic expedition
headed by John Murray and Johan_Hjort was the most ambitious research
oceanographic and marine zoological project ever mounted until then, and led to
the classic 1912 book The Depths of the Ocean.
The first acoustic measurement of sea depth was made in 1914. Between 1925 and
1927 the "Meteor" expedition gathered 70,000 ocean depth measurements using an
echo sounder, surveying the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Sverdrup, Johnson and Fleming published The Oceans in 1942,[12] which was a
major landmark. The Sea (in three volumes, covering physical oceanography,
seawater and geology) edited by M.N. Hill was published in 1962, while Rhodes
Fairbridge's Encyclopedia of Oceanography was published in 1966.
The Great Global Rift, running along the Mid Atlantic Ridge, was discovered by
Maurice_Ewing and Bruce_Heezen in 1953; in 1954 a mountain range under the
Arctic Ocean was found by the Arctic Institute of the USSR. The theory of
seafloor spreading was developed in 1960 by Harry_Hammond_Hess. The Ocean
Drilling_Program started in 1966. Deep-sea vents were discovered in 1977 by
Jack_Corliss and Robert_Ballard in the submersible DSV Alvin.
In the 1950s, Auguste_Piccard invented the bathyscaphe and used the bathyscaphe
Trieste to investigate the ocean's depths. The United States nuclear_submarine
Nautilus made the first journey under the ice to the North Pole in 1958. In
1962 the FLIP (Floating Instrument Platform), a 355-foot (108 m) spar buoy, was
first deployed.
From the 1970s, there has been much emphasis on the application of large scale
computers to oceanography to allow numerical predictions of ocean conditions
and as a part of overall environmental change prediction. An oceanographic buoy
array was established in the Pacific to allow prediction of El_NiÃ±o events.
1990 saw the start of the World_Ocean_Circulation_Experiment (WOCE) which
continued until 2002. Geosat seafloor mapping data became available in 1995.
In recent years studies advanced particular knowledge on ocean_acidification,
ocean_heat_content, ocean_currents, the_El_NiÃ±o_phenomenon, mapping of methane
hydrate deposits, the carbon_cycle, coastal_erosion, weathering and climate
feedbacks in regards to climate_change interactions.
Study of the oceans is linked to understanding global climate changes,
potential global_warming and related biosphere concerns. The atmosphere and
ocean are linked because of evaporation and precipitation as well as thermal
flux (and solar insolation). Wind stress is a major driver of ocean_currents
while the ocean is a sink for atmospheric carbon_dioxide. All these factors
relate to the ocean's biogeochemical setup.
Further understanding of the worlds oceans permit scientists to better decide
weather changes which in addition guides to a more reliable utilization of
earths resources. [13]
***** Branches[edit] *****
Oceanographic frontal systems on the Southern_Hemisphere
The study of oceanography is divided into these four branches:
**** Biological oceanography[edit] ****
Main article: marine_biology
Biological oceanography investigates the ecology of marine organisms in the
context of the physical, chemical and geological characteristics of their ocean
environment and the biology of individual marine organisms.
**** Chemical oceanography[edit] ****
Main article: chemical_oceanography
Chemical oceanography is the study of the chemistry of the ocean. Whereas
chemical oceanography is primarily occupied with the study and understanding of
seawater properties and its changes, ocean chemistry focuses primarily on the
geochemical_cycles. The following is a central topic investigated by chemical
oceanography.
*** Ocean acidification[edit] ***
Main article: Ocean_acidification
Ocean acidification describes the decrease in ocean pH that is caused by
anthropogenic carbon_dioxide (CO
2) emissions into the atmosphere.[14] Seawater is slightly alkaline and had a
preindustrial pH of about 8.2. More recently, anthropogenic activities have
steadily increased the carbon_dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30â40%
of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic_acid and lowering
the pH (now below 8.1[15]) through ocean acidification.[16][17][18] The pH is
expected to reach 7.7 by the year 2100.[19]
An important element for the skeletons of marine animals is calcium, but
calcium_carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and
skeletons dissolve below the carbonate_compensation_depth.[20] Calcium
carbonate becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to
affect marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea
urchins and corals,[21][22] and the carbonate compensation depth will rise
closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include
pteropods, coccolithophorids and foraminifera, all important in the food_chain.
In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as they become
less able to build their calcium carbonate skeletons,[23] in turn adversely
impacting other reef dwellers.[19]
The current rate of ocean chemistry change seems to be unprecedented in Earth's
geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems will adapt to
the shifting conditions of the near future.[24] Of particular concern is the
manner in which the combination of acidification with the expected additional
stressors of higher temperatures and lower_oxygen_levels will impact the seas.
[25]
**** Geological oceanography[edit] ****
Main article: marine_geology
Geological oceanography is the study of the geology of the ocean floor
including plate_tectonics and paleoceanography.
**** Physical oceanography[edit] ****
Main article: Physical_oceanography
Physical oceanography studies the ocean's physical attributes including
temperature-salinity structure, mixing, surface_waves, internal waves, surface
tides, internal_tides, and currents. The following are central topics
investigated by physical oceanography.
*** Ocean currents[edit] ***
Further information: Ocean_current
Since the early ocean expeditions in oceanography, a major interest was the
study of the ocean currents and temperature measurements. The tides, the
Coriolis_effect, changes in direction and strength of wind, salinity and
temperature are the main factors determining ocean currents. The thermohaline
circulation (THC) (thermo- referring to temperature and -haline referring to
salt_content) connects the ocean basins and is primarily dependent on the
density_of_sea_water. It is becoming more common to refer to this system as the
'meridional overturning circulation' because it more accurately accounts for
other driving factors beyond temperature and salinity.
    * Examples of sustained currents are the Gulf_Stream and the Kuroshio
      Current which are wind-driven western_boundary_currents.
*** Ocean heat content[edit] ***
[File:Oceans of Climate Change.ogv]Play_media
Oceans_of_Climate_Change NASA
Further information: Oceanic_heat_content
Oceanic_heat_content (OHC) refers to the heat stored in the ocean. The changes
in the ocean heat play an important role in sea_level_rise, because of thermal
expansion. Ocean_warming accounts for 90% of the energy accumulation from
global_warming between 1971 and 2010.[26]
**** Paleoceanography[edit] ****
Main article: Paleoceanography
Paleoceanography is the study of the history of the oceans in the geologic past
with regard to circulation, chemistry, biology, geology and patterns of
sedimentation and biological productivity. Paleoceanographic studies using
environment models and different proxies enable the scientific community to
assess the role of the oceanic processes in the global climate by the
reconstruction of past climate at various intervals. Paleoceanographic research
is also intimately tied to palaeoclimatology.

***** Oceanographic institutions[edit] *****
Oceanographic_Museum
See also: List_of_oceanographic_institutions_and_programs
The first international organization of oceanography was created in 1902 as the
International_Council_for_the_Exploration_of_the_Sea. In 1903 the Scripps
Institution_of_Oceanography was founded, followed by Woods_Hole_Oceanographic
Institution in 1930, Virginia_Institute_of_Marine_Science in 1938, and later
the Lamont-Doherty_Earth_Observatory at Columbia_University, and the School_of
Oceanography at University_of_Washington. In Britain, the National_Oceanography
Centre (an institute of the Natural_Environment_Research_Council) is the
successor to the UK's Institute of Oceanographic Sciences. In Australia, CSIRO
Marine_and_Atmospheric_Research (CMAR), is a leading centre. In 1921 the
International_Hydrographic_Bureau (IHB) was formed in Monaco.
