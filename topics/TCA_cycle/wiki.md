Overview of the citric acid cycle
The citric acid cycle (CAC) â also known as theTCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid
cycle) or theKrebs cycle[1][2] â is a series of chemical_reactions used by
all aerobic_organisms to release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl-
CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, into adenosine_triphosphate
(ATP) and carbon_dioxide. In addition, the cycle provides precursors of certain
amino acids, as well as the reducing_agent NADH, that are used in numerous
other reactions. Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests
that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism
and may have originated abiogenically.[3][4] Even though it is branded as a
'cycle', it is not necessary for metabolites to follow only one specific route;
at least three segments of the citric acid cycle have been recognized.[5]
The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from the citric_acid (a type of
tricarboxylic_acid, often called citrate, as the ionized form predominates at
biological pH[6]) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of
reactions to complete the cycle. The cycle consumes acetate (in the form of
acetyl-CoA) and water, reduces NAD+ to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a
waste byproduct. The NADH generated by the citric acid cycle is fed into the
oxidative_phosphorylation (electron transport) pathway. The net result of these
two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable
chemical energy in the form of ATP.
In eukaryotic cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the
mitochondrion. In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, which lack mitochondria,
the citric acid cycle reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the
proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface (plasma
membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The overall
yield of energy-containing compounds from the TCA cycle is three NADH, one
FADH2, and one GTP.[7]

***** Discovery[edit] *****
Several of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were
established in the 1930s by the research of Albert_Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi, who received
the Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine in 1937 specifically for his
discoveries pertaining to fumaric_acid, a key component of the cycle.[8] He was
able to make this discovery successful with the help of pigeon breast muscle.
Because this tissue maintains its oxidative capacity well after breaking down
in the "Latapie" mill and releasing in aqueous solutions, breast muscle of the
pigeon was very well qualified for the study of oxidative reactions.[9] The
citric acid cycle itself was finally identified in 1937 by Hans_Adolf_Krebs and
William Arthur Johnson while at the University_of_Sheffield,[10] for which the
former received the Nobel_Prize_for_Physiology_or_Medicine in 1953, and for
whom the cycle is sometimes named (Krebs cycle).[11]
***** Overview[edit] *****
Structural diagram of acetyl-CoA: The portion in blue, on the left, is the
acetyl_group; the portion in black is coenzyme_A.
The citric acid cycle is a key metabolic pathway that connects carbohydrate,
fat, and protein metabolism. The reactions of the cycle are carried out by
eight enzymes that completely oxidize acetate (a two carbon molecule), in the
form of acetyl-CoA, into two molecules each of carbon dioxide and water.
Through catabolism of sugars, fats, and proteins, the two-carbon organic
product acetyl-CoA (a form of acetate) is produced which enters the citric acid
cycle. The reactions of the cycle also convert three equivalents of
nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide (NAD+) into three equivalents of reduced NAD+
(NADH), one equivalent of flavin_adenine_dinucleotide (FAD) into one equivalent
of FADH2, and one equivalent each of guanosine_diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic
phosphate (Pi) into one equivalent of guanosine_triphosphate (GTP). The NADH
and FADH2 generated by the citric acid cycle are, in turn, used by the
oxidative_phosphorylation pathway to generate energy-rich ATP.
One of the primary sources of acetyl-CoA is from the breakdown of sugars by
glycolysis which yield pyruvate that in turn is decarboxylated by the pyruvate
dehydrogenase_complex generating acetyl-CoA according to the following reaction
scheme:
      CH3C(=O)C(=O)Oâpyruvate + HSCoA + NAD+ â CH3C(=O)SCoAacetyl-CoA +
      NADH + CO2
The product of this reaction, acetyl-CoA, is the starting point for the citric
acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA may also be obtained from the oxidation of fatty acids.
Below is a schematic outline of the cycle:
    * The citric_acid cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon acetyl
      group from acetyl-CoA to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate)
      to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).
    * The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations,
      losing two carboxyl groups as CO2. The carbons lost as CO2 originate from
      what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated
      by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the
      first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated
      carbons as CO2 requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However,
      because of the role of the citric acid cycle in anabolism, they might not
      be lost, since many citric acid cycle intermediates are also used as
      precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.[12]
    * Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is
      transferred as energy-rich electrons to NAD+, forming NADH. For each
      acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH
      are produced.citric acid include a series of oxidation reduction reaction
      in mitochondria .
    * In addition, electrons from the succinate oxidation step are transferred
      first to the FAD cofactor of succinate dehydrogenase, reducing it to
      FADH2, and eventually to ubiquinone (Q) in the mitochondrial membrane,
      reducing it to ubiquinol (QH2) which is a substrate of the electron
      transfer chain at the level of Complex_III.
    * For every NADH and FADH2 that are produced in the citric acid cycle, 2.5
      and 1.5 ATP molecules are generated in oxidative phosphorylation,
      respectively.
    * At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been
      regenerated, and the cycle continues.
***** Steps[edit] *****
There are ten basic steps in the citric acid cycle, as outline below. The cycle
is continuously supplied with new carbon in the form of acetyl-CoA, entering at
step 0 in the table.[13]

Two carbon atoms are oxidized to CO2, the energy from these reactions is
transferred to other metabolic processes through GTP (or ATP), and as electrons
in NADH and QH2. The NADH generated in the citric acid cycle may later be
oxidized (donate its electrons) to drive ATP synthesis in a type of process
called oxidative_phosphorylation.[6] FADH2 is covalently attached to succinate
dehydrogenase, an enzyme which functions both in the CAC and the mitochondrial
electron_transport_chain in oxidative phosphorylation. FADH2, therefore,
facilitates transfer of electrons to coenzyme_Q, which is the final electron
acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase
complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain.[14]
Mitochondria in animals, including humans, possess two succinyl-CoA
synthetases: one that produces GTP from GDP, and another that produces ATP from
ADP.[15] Plants have the type that produces ATP (ADP-forming succinyl-CoA
synthetase).[13] Several of the enzymes in the cycle may be loosely associated
in a multienzyme protein_complex within the mitochondrial_matrix.[16]
The GTP that is formed by GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase may be utilized
by nucleoside-diphosphate_kinase to form ATP (the catalyzed reaction is GTP +
ADP â GDP + ATP).[14]
***** Products[edit] *****
Products of the first turn of the cycle are one GTP (or ATP), three NADH, one
QH2 and two CO2.[17]
Because two acetyl-CoA molecules are produced from each glucose molecule, two
cycles are required per glucose molecule. Therefore, at the end of two cycles,
the products are: two GTP, six NADH, two QH2, and four CO2.

The total number of ATP molecules obtained after complete oxidation of one
glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative_phosphorylation is
estimated to be between 30 and 38.[18]
***** Efficiency[edit] *****
The theoretical maximum yield of ATP through oxidation of one molecule of
glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative_phosphorylation is 38
(assuming 3 molar_equivalents of ATP per equivalent NADH and 2 ATP per FADH2).
In eukaryotes, two equivalents of NADH and four equivalents of ATP are
generated in glycolysis, which takes place in the cytoplasm. Transport of two
of these equivalents of NADH into the mitochondria consumes two equivalents of
ATP, thus reducing the net production of ATP to 36. Furthermore, inefficiencies
in oxidative_phosphorylation due to leakage of protons across the mitochondrial
membrane and slippage of the ATP_synthase/proton pump commonly reduces the ATP
yield from NADH and FADH2 to less than the theoretical maximum yield.[18] The
observed yields are, therefore, closer to ~2.5 ATP per NADH and ~1.5 ATP per
FADH2, further reducing the total net production of ATP to approximately 30.
[19] An assessment of the total ATP yield with newly revised proton-to-ATP
ratios provides an estimate of 29.85 ATP per glucose molecule.[20]
***** Variation[edit] *****
While the citric acid cycle is in general highly conserved, there is
significant variability in the enzymes found in different taxa[21] (note that
the diagrams on this page are specific to the mammalian pathway variant).
Some differences exist between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The conversion of D-
threo-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the NAD+-
dependent EC_1.1.1.41, while prokaryotes employ the NADP+-dependent EC
1.1.1.42.[22] Similarly, the conversion of (S)-malate to oxaloacetate is
catalyzed in eukaryotes by the NAD+-dependent EC_1.1.1.37, while most
prokaryotes utilize a quinone-dependent enzyme, EC_1.1.5.4.[23]
A step with significant variability is the conversion of succinyl-CoA to
succinate. Most organisms utilize EC_6.2.1.5, succinateâCoA ligase (ADP-
forming) (despite its name, the enzyme operates in the pathway in the direction
of ATP formation). In mammals a GTP-forming enzyme, succinateâCoA ligase
(GDP-forming) (EC_6.2.1.4) also operates. The level of utilization of each
isoform is tissue dependent.[24] In some acetate-producing bacteria, such as
Acetobacter aceti, an entirely different enzyme catalyzes this conversion â
EC_2.8.3.18, succinyl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase. This specialized enzyme
links the TCA cycle with acetate metabolism in these organisms.[25] Some
bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, employ yet another enzyme for this
conversion â succinyl-CoA:acetoacetate CoA-transferase (EC_2.8.3.5).[26]
Some variability also exists at the previous step â the conversion of 2-
oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. While most organisms utilize the ubiquitous NAD+-
dependent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, some bacteria utilize a ferredoxin-
dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase (EC_1.2.7.3).[27] Other organisms, including
obligately autotrophic and methanotrophic bacteria and archaea, bypass
succinyl-CoA entirely, and convert 2-oxoglutarate to succinate via succinate
semialdehyde, using EC_4.1.1.71, 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase, and EC_1.2.1.79,
succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase.[28]
***** Regulation[edit] *****
Allosteric regulation by metabolites. The regulation of the citric acid cycle
is largely determined by product inhibition and substrate availability. If the
cycle were permitted to run unchecked, large amounts of metabolic energy could
be wasted in overproduction of reduced coenzyme such as NADH and ATP. The major
eventual substrate of the cycle is ADP which gets converted to ATP. A reduced
amount of ADP causes accumulation of precursor NADH which in turn can inhibit a
number of enzymes. NADH, a product of all dehydrogenases in the citric acid
cycle with the exception of succinate_dehydrogenase, inhibits pyruvate
dehydrogenase, isocitrate_dehydrogenase, Î±-ketoglutarate_dehydrogenase, and
also citrate_synthase. Acetyl-coA inhibits pyruvate_dehydrogenase, while
succinyl-CoA inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and citrate_synthase.
When tested in vitro with TCA enzymes, ATP inhibits citrate_synthase and Î±-
ketoglutarate_dehydrogenase; however, ATP levels do not change more than 10% in
vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. There is no known allosteric mechanism
that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an allosteric effector
whose concentration changes less than 10%.[6]
Citrate is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits phosphofructokinase, an
enzyme involved in glycolysis that catalyses formation of fructose_1,6-
bisphosphate, a precursor of pyruvate. This prevents a constant high rate of
flux when there is an accumulation of citrate and a decrease in substrate for
the enzyme.
Regulation by calcium. Calcium is also used as a regulator in the citric acid
cycle. Calcium levels in the mitochondrial matrix can reach up to the tens of
micromolar levels during cellular activation.[29] It activates pyruvate
dehydrogenase_phosphatase which in turn activates the pyruvate_dehydrogenase
complex. Calcium also activates isocitrate_dehydrogenase and Î±-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase.[30] This increases the reaction rate of many of the steps in the
cycle, and therefore increases flux throughout the pathway.
Transcriptional regulation. Recent work has demonstrated an important link
between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of hypoxia-
inducible_factors (HIF). HIF plays a role in the regulation of oxygen
homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular
remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. HIF is
synthesized constitutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical
proline residues mediates their interaction with the von Hippel Lindau E3
ubiquitin_ligase complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. This
reaction is catalysed by prolyl_4-hydroxylases. Fumarate and succinate have
been identified as potent inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases, thus leading to
the stabilisation of HIF.[31]
***** Major metabolic pathways converging on the citric acid cycle[edit] *****
Several catabolic pathways converge on the citric acid cycle. Most of these
reactions add intermediates to the citric acid cycle, and are therefore known
as anaplerotic_reactions, from the Greek meaning to "fill up". These increase
the amount of acetyl CoA that the cycle is able to carry, increasing the
mitochondrion's capability to carry out respiration if this is otherwise a
limiting factor. Processes that remove intermediates from the cycle are termed
"cataplerotic" reactions.
In this section and in the next, the citric acid cycle intermediates are
indicated in italics to distinguish them from other substrates and end-
products.
Pyruvate molecules produced by glycolysis are actively_transported across the
inner mitochondrial membrane, and into the matrix. Here they can be oxidized
and combined with coenzyme_A to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH, as in the
normal cycle.[32]
However, it is also possible for pyruvate to be carboxylated by pyruvate
carboxylase to form oxaloacetate. This latter reaction "fills up" the amount of
oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic
reaction, increasing the cycleâs capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the
tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.[33]
In the citric acid cycle all the intermediates (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate,
alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) are
regenerated during each turn of the cycle. Adding more of any of these
intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount
is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is
converted into the other. Hence the addition of any one of them to the cycle
has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These
anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle,
increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with
acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of
ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the
cell.[33]
Acetyl-CoA, on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the
beta-oxidation of fatty_acids, is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle.
With each turn of the cycle one molecule of acetyl-CoA is consumed for every
molecule of oxaloacetate present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never
regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-CoA that
produces CO2 and water, with the energy thus released captured in the form of
ATP.[33] The three steps of beta-oxidation resemble the steps that occur in the
production of oxaloacetate from succinate in the TCA cycle. Acyl-CoA is
oxidized to trans-Enoyl-CoA while FAD is reduced to FADH2, which is similar to
the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. Following, trans-Enoyl-CoA is hydrated
across the double bond to beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA, just like fumarate is hydrated
to malate. Lastly, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA is oxidized to beta-ketoacyl-CoA while
NAD+ is reduced to NADH, which follows the same process as the oxidation of
malate to oxaloacetate.[34]
In the liver, the carboxylation of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial
oxaloacetate is an early step in the gluconeogenic pathway which converts
lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose,[32][33] under the influence of
high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood.[33] Here the addition
of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as
another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the
mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately
converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.
[33]
In protein_catabolism, proteins are broken down by proteases into their
constituent amino acids. Their carbon skeletons (i.e. the de-aminated amino
acids) may either enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates (e.g. alpha-
ketoglutarate derived from glutamate or glutamine), having an anaplerotic
effect on the cycle, or, in the case of leucine, isoleucine, lysine,
phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, they are converted into acetyl-CoA
which can be burned to CO2 and water, or used to form ketone_bodies, which too
can only be burned in tissues other than the liver where they are formed, or
excreted via the urine or breath.[33] These latter amino acids are therefore
termed "ketogenic" amino acids, whereas those that enter the citric acid cycle
as intermediates can only be cataplerotically removed by entering the
gluconeogenic pathway via malate which is transported out of the mitochondrion
to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate and ultimately into glucose. These
are the so-called "glucogenic" amino acids. De-aminated alanine, cysteine,
glycine, serine, and threonine are converted to pyruvate and can consequently
either enter the citric acid cycle as oxaloacetate (an anaplerotic reaction) or
as acetyl-CoA to be disposed of as CO2 and water.[33]
In fat_catabolism, triglycerides are hydrolyzed to break them into fatty_acids
and glycerol. In the liver the glycerol can be converted into glucose via
dihydroxyacetone_phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by way of
gluconeogenesis. In many tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle tissue,
fatty acids are broken down through a process known as beta_oxidation, which
results in the production of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, which can be used in the
citric acid cycle. Beta oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of
methylene_bridges produces propionyl-CoA, which is then converted into
succinyl-CoA and fed into the citric acid cycle as an anaplerotic intermediate.
[35]
The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one (six-carbon)
molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the formation of 2 acetyl-CoA molecules,
their catabolism in the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals
about 30 ATP molecules, in eukaryotes. The number of ATP molecules derived from
the beta oxidation of a 6 carbon segment of a fatty acid chain, and the
subsequent oxidation of the resulting 3 molecules of acetyl-CoA is 40.
***** Citric acid cycle intermediates serve as substrates for biosynthetic
processes[edit] *****
In this subheading, as in the previous one, the TCA intermediates are
identified by italics.
Several of the citric acid cycle intermediates are used for the synthesis of
important compounds, which will have significant cataplerotic effects on the
cycle.[33] Acetyl-CoA cannot be transported out of the mitochondrion. To obtain
cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate is removed from the citric acid cycle and carried
across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved
by ATP_citrate_lyase into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is
returned to mitochondrion as malate (and then converted back into oxaloacetate
to transfer more acetyl-CoA out of the mitochondrion).[36] The cytosolic
acetyl-CoA is used for fatty_acid_synthesis and the production_of_cholesterol.
Cholesterol can, in turn, be used to synthesize the steroid_hormones, bile
salts, and vitamin_D.[32][33]
The carbon skeletons of many non-essential_amino_acids are made from citric
acid cycle intermediates. To turn them into amino acids the alpha_keto-acids
formed from the citric acid cycle intermediates have to acquire their amino
groups from glutamate in a transamination reaction, in which pyridoxal
phosphate is a cofactor. In this reaction the glutamate is converted into
alpha-ketoglutarate, which is a citric acid cycle intermediate. The
intermediates that can provide the carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis
are oxaloacetate which forms aspartate and asparagine; and alpha-ketoglutarate
which forms glutamine, proline, and arginine.[32][33]
Of these amino acids, aspartate and glutamine are used, together with carbon
and nitrogen atoms from other sources, to form the purines that are used as the
bases in DNA and RNA, as well as in ATP, AMP, GTP, NAD, FAD and CoA.[33]
The pyrimidines are partly assembled from aspartate (derived from
oxaloacetate). The pyrimidines, thymine, cytosine and uracil, form the
complementary bases to the purine bases in DNA and RNA, and are also components
of CTP, UMP, UDP and UTP.[33]
The majority of the carbon atoms in the porphyrins come from the citric acid
cycle intermediate, succinyl-CoA. These molecules are an important component of
the hemoproteins, such as hemoglobin, myoglobin and various cytochromes.[33]
During gluconeogenesis mitochondrial_oxaloacetate_is_reduced_to_malate which is
then transported out of the mitochondrion, to be oxidized back to oxaloacetate
in the cytosol. Cytosolic oxaloacetate is then decarboxylated to
phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase, which is the rate
limiting step in the conversion of nearly all the gluconeogenic precursors
(such as the glucogenic amino acids and lactate) into glucose by the liver and
kidney.[32][33]
Because the citric acid cycle is involved in both catabolic and anabolic
processes, it is known as an amphibolic pathway.

***** Glucose feeds the TCA cycle via circulating lactate[edit] *****
The metabolic role of lactate is well recognized as a fuel for tissues and
tumors. In the classical Cori_cycle, muscles produce lactate which is then
taken up by the liver for gluconeogenesis. New studies suggest that lactate can
be used as a source of carbon for the TCA cycle.[37]
***** Evolution[edit] *****
It is believed that components of the citric acid cycle were derived from
anaerobic_bacteria, and that the TCA cycle itself may have evolved more than
once.[38] Theoretically, several alternatives to the TCA cycle exist; however,
the TCA cycle appears to be the most efficient. If several TCA alternatives had
evolved independently, they all appear to have converged to the TCA cycle.[39]
