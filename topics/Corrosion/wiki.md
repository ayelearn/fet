Corrosion is a natural_process that converts a refined metal to a more
chemically-stable form, such as its oxide, hydroxide, or sulfide. It is the
gradual destruction of materials (usually metals) by chemical and/or
electrochemical reaction with their environment. Corrosion_engineering is the
field dedicated to controlling and stopping corrosion.
In the most common use of the word, this means electrochemical oxidation of
metal in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen or sulfates. Rusting, the
formation of iron oxides, is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion.
This type of damage typically produces oxide(s) or salt(s) of the original
metal, and results in a distinctive orange colouration. Corrosion can also
occur in materials other than metals, such as ceramics or polymers, although in
this context, the term "degradation" is more common. Corrosion degrades the
useful properties of materials and structures including strength, appearance
and permeability to liquids and gases.
Many structural alloys corrode merely from exposure to moisture in air, but the
process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances. Corrosion
can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack, or it can extend across a
wide area more or less uniformly corroding the surface. Because corrosion is a
diffusion-controlled process, it occurs on exposed surfaces. As a result,
methods to reduce the activity of the exposed surface, such as passivation and
chromate_conversion, can increase a material's corrosion resistance. However,
some corrosion mechanisms are less visible and less predictable.

***** Galvanic corrosion[edit] *****
Main article: Galvanic_corrosion
Galvanic corrosion of aluminium. A 5-mm-thick aluminium alloy plate is
physically (and hence, electrically) connected to a 10-mm-thick mild steel
structural support. Galvanic corrosion occurred on the aluminium plate along
the joint with the steel. Perforation of aluminium plate occurred within 2
years.
Galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical
contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the
same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a
galvanic_couple, the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated
rate and the more noble_metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When
immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s)
to use is readily determined by following the galvanic_series. For example,
zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures. Galvanic
corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water
(containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.
Factors such as relative size of anode, types of metal, and operating
conditions (temperature, humidity, salinity, etc.) affect galvanic corrosion.
The surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion
rates of the materials. Galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of
sacrificial_anodes.
**** Galvanic series[edit] ****
Main article: Galvanic_series
In any given environment (one standard medium is aerated, room-temperature
seawater), one metal will be either more noble or more active than others,
based on how strongly its ions are bound to the surface. Two metals in
electrical contact share the same electrons, so that the "tug-of-war" at each
surface is analogous to competition for free electrons between the two
materials. Using the electrolyte as a host for the flow of ions in the same
direction, the noble metal will take electrons from the active one. The
resulting mass flow or electric current can be measured to establish a
hierarchy of materials in the medium of interest. This hierarchy is called a
galvanic series and is useful in predicting and understanding corrosion.
***** Corrosion removal[edit] *****
Main article: Rust_removal
Often it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion. For
example, phosphoric_acid in the form of naval_jelly is often applied to ferrous
tools or surfaces to remove rust. Corrosion removal should not be confused with
electropolishing, which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a
smooth surface. For example, phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish
copper but it does this by removing copper, not the products of copper
corrosion.
***** Resistance to corrosion[edit] *****
Some metals are more intrinsically resistant to corrosion than others (for some
examples, see galvanic_series). There are various ways of protecting_metals
from_corrosion (oxidation) including painting, hot_dip_galvanizing, and
combinations of these.[1]
**** Intrinsic chemistry[edit] ****
Gold_nuggets do not naturally corrode, even on a geological time scale.
The materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is
thermodynamically unfavorable. Any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend
to decompose spontaneously into pure metal, which is why these elements can be
found in metallic form on Earth and have long been valued. More common "base"
metals can only be protected by more temporary means.
Some metals have naturally slow reaction_kinetics, even though their corrosion
is thermodynamically favorable. These include such metals as zinc, magnesium,
and cadmium. While corrosion of these metals is continuous and ongoing, it
happens at an acceptably slow rate. An extreme example is graphite, which
releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation, but has such slow kinetics
that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal
conditions.
**** Passivation[edit] ****
Main article: Passivation_(chemistry)
Passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultrathin film of
corrosion products, known as a passive film, on the metal's surface that act as
a barrier to further oxidation. The chemical composition and microstructure of
a passive film are different from the underlying metal. Typical passive film
thickness on aluminium, stainless steels, and alloys is within 10 nanometers.
The passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating
and are in the micrometer thickness range â the passive film recovers if
removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not. Passivation in natural
environments such as air, water and soil at moderate pH is seen in such
materials as aluminium, stainless_steel, titanium, and silicon.
Passivation is primarily determined by metallurgical and environmental factors.
The effect of pH is summarized using Pourbaix_diagrams, but many other factors
are influential. Some conditions that inhibit passivation include high pH for
aluminium and zinc, low pH or the presence of chloride ions for stainless
steel, high temperature for titanium (in which case the oxide dissolves into
the metal, rather than the electrolyte) and fluoride ions for silicon. On the
other hand, unusual conditions may result in passivation of materials that are
normally unprotected, as the alkaline environment of concrete does for steel
rebar. Exposure to a liquid metal such as mercury or hot solder can often
circumvent passivation mechanisms.
***** Corrosion in passivated materials[edit] *****
Passivation is extremely useful in mitigating corrosion damage, however even a
high-quality alloy will corrode if its ability to form a passivating film is
hindered. Proper selection of the right grade of material for the specific
environment is important for the long-lasting performance of this group of
materials. If breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or
mechanical factors, the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting
corrosion, crevice_corrosion, and stress_corrosion_cracking.
**** Pitting corrosion[edit] ****
Main article: Pitting_corrosion
Diagram showing cross-section of pitting corrosion
Certain conditions, such as low concentrations of oxygen or high concentrations
of species such as chloride which compete as anions, can interfere with a given
alloy's ability to re-form a passivating film. In the worst case, almost all of
the surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the
oxide film in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly
amplified, and can cause corrosion pits of several types, depending upon
conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme
circumstances, they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal,
since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH
decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an
autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and
narrow corrosion pits can cause stress_concentration to the point that
otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small
hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially
dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure
fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in
passivated alloys,[citation_needed] but it can be prevented by control of the
alloy's environment.
Pitting results when a small hole, or cavity, forms in the metal, usually as a
result of de-passivation of a small area. This area becomes anodic, while part
of the remaining metal becomes cathodic, producing a localized galvanic
reaction. The deterioration of this small area penetrates the metal and can
lead to failure. This form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the
fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by
corrosion-produced compounds.
**** Weld decay and knifeline attack[edit] ****
Main article: Intergranular_corrosion
Normal microstructure of Type 304 stainless steel surface
Sensitized metallic microstructure, showing wider intergranular boundaries
Stainless steel can pose special corrosion challenges, since its passivating
behavior relies on the presence of a major alloying component (chromium, at
least 11.5%). Because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat
treatment, chromium_carbides can form in the grain_boundaries of stainless
alloys. This chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near
the grain boundary, making those areas much less resistant to corrosion. This
creates a galvanic_couple with the well-protected alloy nearby, which leads to
"weld decay" (corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones) in
highly corrosive environments. This process can seriously reduce the mechanical
strength of welded joints over time.
A stainless steel is said to be "sensitized" if chromium carbides are formed in
the microstructure. A typical microstructure of a normalized type_304_stainless
steel shows no signs of sensitization, while a heavily sensitized steel shows
the presence of grain boundary precipitates. The dark lines in the sensitized
microstructure are networks of chromium carbides formed along the grain
boundaries.
Special alloys, either with low carbon content or with added carbon "getters"
such as titanium and niobium (in types 321 and 347, respectively), can prevent
this effect, but the latter require special heat treatment after welding to
prevent the similar phenomenon of "knifeline attack". As its name implies,
corrosion is limited to a very narrow zone adjacent to the weld, often only a
few micrometers across, making it even less noticeable.
**** Crevice corrosion[edit] ****
Main article: Crevice_corrosion
Corrosion in the crevice between the tube and tube sheet (both made of type_316
stainless_steel) of a heat exchanger in a seawater desalination plant
Crevice_corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces
(crevices), to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is
limited. Formation of a differential aeration cell leads to corrosion inside
the crevices. Examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts,
under gaskets or seals, inside cracks and seams, spaces filled with deposits
and under sludge piles.
Crevice corrosion is influenced by the crevice type (metal-metal, metal-
nonmetal), crevice geometry (size, surface finish), and metallurgical and
environmental factors. The susceptibility to crevice corrosion can be evaluated
with ASTM standard procedures. A critical crevice corrosion temperature is
commonly used to rank a material's resistance to crevice corrosion.

***** High-temperature corrosion[edit] *****
See also: Thermal_oxidation
High-temperature_corrosion is chemical deterioration of a material (typically a
metal) as a result of heating. This non-galvanic form of corrosion can occur
when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen, sulfur, or
other compounds capable of oxidizing (or assisting the oxidation of) the
material concerned. For example, materials used in aerospace, power generation
and even in car engines have to resist sustained periods at high temperature in
which they may be exposed to an atmosphere containing potentially highly
corrosive products of combustion.
The products of high-temperature corrosion can potentially be turned to the
advantage of the engineer. The formation of oxides on stainless steels, for
example, can provide a protective layer preventing further atmospheric attack,
allowing for a material to be used for sustained periods at both room and high
temperatures in hostile conditions. Such high-temperature corrosion products,
in the form of compacted_oxide_layer_glazes, prevent or reduce wear during
high-temperature sliding contact of metallic (or metallic and ceramic)
surfaces. Thermal_oxidation is also commonly used as a route towards the
obtainment of controlled oxide nanostructures, including nanowires and thin
films.
***** Microbial corrosion[edit] *****
Main article: Microbial_corrosion
Microbial_corrosion, or commonly known as microbiologically influenced
corrosion (MIC), is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms, usually
chemoautotrophs. It can apply to both metallic and non-metallic materials, in
the presence or absence of oxygen. Sulfate-reducing_bacteria are active in the
absence of oxygen (anaerobic); they produce hydrogen_sulfide, causing sulfide
stress_cracking. In the presence of oxygen (aerobic), some bacteria may
directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides, other bacteria oxidize
sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic_sulfide_corrosion.
Concentration_cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products, leading to
localized corrosion.
Accelerated low-water corrosion (ALWC) is a particularly aggressive form of MIC
that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is
characterized by an orange sludge, which smells of hydrogen sulfide when
treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion
allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile.
[2] Piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed at the
time of construction are not susceptible to ALWC. For unprotected piles,
sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit
the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be
installed. Affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection, using
either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a
calcareous deposit, which will help shield the metal from further attack.
***** Metal dusting[edit] *****
Main article: Metal_dusting
Metal_dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible
materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities, such as
synthesis gas and other high-CO environments. The corrosion manifests itself as
a break-up of bulk metal to metal powder. The suspected mechanism is firstly
the deposition of a graphite layer on the surface of the metal, usually from
carbon_monoxide (CO) in the vapor phase. This graphite layer is then thought to
form metastable M3C species (where M is the metal), which migrate away from the
metal surface. However, in some regimes no M3C species is observed indicating a
direct transfer of metal atoms into the graphite layer.
***** Protection from corrosion[edit] *****
The US military shrink_wraps equipment such as helicopters to protect them from
corrosion and thus save millions of dollars
Various treatments are used to slow corrosion damage to metallic objects which
are exposed to the weather, salt water, acids, or other hostile environments.
Some unprotected metallic alloys are extremely vulnerable to corrosion, such as
those used in neodymium_magnets, which can spall or crumble into powder even in
dry, temperature-stable indoor environments unless properly treated to
discourage corrosion.
**** Surface treatments[edit] ****
When surface treatments are used to retard corrosion, great care must be taken
to ensure complete coverage, without gaps, cracks, or pinhole defects. Small
defects can act as an "Achilles'_heel", allowing corrosion to penetrate the
interior and causing extensive damage even while the outer protective layer
remains apparently intact for a period of time.
*** Applied coatings[edit] ***
Main article: Galvanization
Galvanized surface
Plating, painting, and the application of enamel are the most common anti-
corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant
material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside
from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical
flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings
usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the
substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic_couple will cause any
exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For
this reason, it is often wise to plate with active metal such as zinc or
cadmium. If the zinc coating is not thick enough the surface soon becomes
unsightly with rusting obvious. The design life is directly related to the
metal coating thickness.
Corroding Steel Electrification Gantry
Painting either by roller or brush is more desirable for tight spaces; spray
would be better for larger coating areas such as steel decks and waterfront
applications. Flexible polyurethane coatings, like Durabak-M26 for example, can
provide an anti-corrosive seal with a highly durable slip resistant membrane.
Painted coatings are relatively easy to apply and have fast drying times
although temperature and humidity may cause dry times to vary.
*** Reactive coatings[edit] ***
If the environment is controlled (especially in recirculating systems),
corrosion_inhibitors can often be added to it. These chemicals form an
electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal
surfaces, to suppress electrochemical reactions. Such methods make the system
less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating, since extra inhibitors
can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed. Chemicals that inhibit
corrosion include some of the salts in hard_water (Roman water systems are
famous for their mineral_deposits), chromates, phosphates, polyaniline, other
conducting_polymers and a wide range of specially-designed chemicals that
resemble surfactants (i.e. long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups).
*** Anodization[edit] ***
Main article: Anodizing
This climbing_descender is anodized with a yellow finish.
Aluminium_alloys often undergo a surface treatment. Electrochemical conditions
in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores, several nanometers
wide, appear in the metal's oxide film. These pores allow the oxide to grow
much thicker than passivating conditions would allow. At the end of the
treatment, the pores are allowed to seal, forming a harder-than-usual surface
layer. If this coating is scratched, normal passivation processes take over to
protect the damaged area.
Anodizing is very resilient to weathering and corrosion, so it is commonly used
for building facades and other areas where the surface will come into regular
contact with the elements. While being resilient, it must be cleaned
frequently. If left without cleaning, panel_edge_staining will naturally occur.
Anodization is the process of converting an anode into cathode by bringing a
more active anode in contact with it.
*** Biofilm coatings[edit] ***
A new form of protection has been developed by applying certain species of
bacterial films to the surface of metals in highly corrosive environments. This
process increases the corrosion resistance substantially. Alternatively,
antimicrobial-producing biofilms can be used to inhibit mild steel corrosion
from sulfate-reducing_bacteria.[3]
**** Controlled permeability formwork[edit] ****
Main article: Controlled_permeability_formwork
Controlled permeability formwork (CPF) is a method of preventing the corrosion
of reinforcement by naturally enhancing the durability of the cover during
concrete placement. CPF has been used in environments to combat the effects of
carbonation, chlorides, frost and abrasion.
**** Cathodic protection[edit] ****
Main article: Cathodic_protection
Cathodic protection (CP) is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal
surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical_cell. Cathodic
protection systems are most commonly used to protect steel pipelines and tanks;
steel pier piles, ships, and offshore oil_platforms.
*** Sacrificial anode protection[edit] ***
Sacrificial anode attached to the hull of a ship
For effective CP, the potential of the steel surface is polarized (pushed) more
negative until the metal surface has a uniform potential. With a uniform
potential, the driving force for the corrosion reaction is halted. For galvanic
CP systems, the anode material corrodes under the influence of the steel, and
eventually it must be replaced. The polarization is caused by the current flow
from the anode to the cathode, driven by the difference in electrode_potential
between the anode and the cathode. The most common sacrificial anode materials
are aluminum, zinc, magnesium and related alloys. Aluminum has the highest
capacity, and magnesium has the highest driving voltage and is thus used where
resistance is higher. Zinc is general purpose and the basis for galvanizing.
*** Impressed current cathodic protection[edit] ***
For larger structures, galvanic anodes cannot economically deliver enough
current to provide complete protection. Impressed_current_cathodic_protection
(ICCP) systems use anodes connected to a DC power source (such as a cathodic
protection_rectifier). Anodes for ICCP systems are tubular and solid rod shapes
of various specialized materials. These include high silicon cast_iron,
graphite, mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod
and wires.
**** Anodic protection[edit] ****
Main article: Anodic_protection
Anodic protection impresses anodic current on the structure to be protected
(opposite to the cathodic protection). It is appropriate for metals that
exhibit passivity (e.g. stainless steel) and suitably small passive current
over a wide range of potentials. It is used in aggressive environments, such as
solutions of sulfuric acid.
**** Rate of corrosion[edit] ****
These neodymium_magnets corroded extremely rapidly after only 5 months of
outside exposure
The formation of an oxide layer is described by the Deal_Grove_model, which is
used to predict and control oxide layer formation in diverse situations. A
simple test for measuring corrosion is the weight loss method.[4] The method
involves exposing a clean weighed piece of the metal or alloy to the corrosive
environment for a specified time followed by cleaning to remove corrosion
products and weighing the piece to determine the loss of weight. The rate of
corrosion (R) is calculated as
         R =    k W   &#x03C1; A t      {\displaystyle R={\frac {kW}{\rho At}}}
      [{\displaystyle R={\frac {kW}{\rho At}}}]
where k is a constant, W is the weight loss of the metal in time t, A is the
surface area of the metal exposed, and Ï is the density of the metal (in g/
cmÂ³).
Other common expressions for the corrosion rate is penetration depth and change
of mechanical properties.
***** Economic impact[edit] *****
The collapsed Silver Bridge, as seen from the Ohio side
In 2002, the US Federal_Highway_Administration released a study titled
"Corrosion Costs and Preventive Strategies in the United States" on the direct
costs associated with metallic corrosion in the US industry. In 1998, the total
annual direct cost of corrosion in the U.S. was ca. $276 billion (ca. 3.2% of
the US gross_domestic_product).[5] Broken down into five specific industries,
the economic losses are $22.6 billion in infrastructure; $17.6 billion in
production and manufacturing; $29.7 billion in transportation; $20.1 billion in
government; and $47.9 billion in utilities.[6]
Rust is one of the most common causes of bridge accidents. As rust has a much
higher volume than the originating mass of iron, its build-up can also cause
failure by forcing apart adjacent parts. It was the cause of the collapse of
the Mianus_river_bridge in 1983, when the bearings rusted internally and pushed
one corner of the road slab off its support. Three drivers on the roadway at
the time died as the slab fell into the river below. The following NTSB
investigation showed that a drain in the road had been blocked for road re-
surfacing, and had not been unblocked; as a result, runoff water penetrated the
support hangers. Rust was also an important factor in the Silver_Bridge
disaster of 1967 in West_Virginia, when a steel suspension_bridge collapsed
within a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time.
Similarly, corrosion of concrete-covered steel and iron can cause the concrete
to spall, creating severe structural problems. It is one of the most common
failure modes of reinforced_concrete bridges. Measuring instruments based on
the half-cell potential can detect the potential corrosion spots before total
failure of the concrete structure is reached.
Until 20â30 years ago, galvanized steel pipe was used extensively in the
potable water systems for single and multi-family residents as well as
commercial and public construction. Today, these systems have long ago consumed
the protective zinc and are corroding internally resulting in poor water
quality and pipe failures.[7] The economic impact on homeowners, condo
dwellers, and the public infrastructure is estimated at 22 billion dollars as
the insurance industry braces for a wave of claims due to pipe failures.
***** Corrosion in nonmetals[edit] *****
Most ceramic materials are almost entirely immune to corrosion. The strong
chemical_bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical energy
in the structure; they can be thought of as already corroded. When corrosion
does occur, it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or
chemical reaction, rather than an electrochemical process. A common example of
corrosion protection in ceramics is the lime added to soda-lime glass to reduce
its solubility in water; though it is not nearly as soluble as pure sodium
silicate, normal glass does form sub-microscopic flaws when exposed to
moisture. Due to its brittleness, such flaws cause a dramatic reduction in the
strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature.
**** Corrosion of polymers[edit] ****
Ozone_cracking in natural_rubber tubing
Polymer_degradation involves several complex and often poorly understood
physiochemical processes. These are strikingly different from the other
processes discussed here, and so the term "corrosion" is only applied to them
in a loose sense of the word. Because of their large molecular weight, very
little entropy can be gained by mixing a given mass of polymer with another
substance, making them generally quite difficult to dissolve. While dissolution
is a problem in some polymer applications, it is relatively simple to design
against.
A more common and related problem is "swelling", where small molecules
infiltrate the structure, reducing strength and stiffness and causing a volume
change. Conversely, many polymers (notably flexible vinyl) are intentionally
swelled with plasticizers, which can be leached out of the structure, causing
brittleness or other undesirable changes.
The most common form of degradation, however, is a decrease in polymer chain
length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists
because of their effect on DNA: ionizing_radiation (most commonly ultraviolet
light), free_radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone
cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural_rubber for example. Plastic
additives can slow these process very effectively, and can be as simple as a
UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium_dioxide or carbon_black). Plastic_shopping
bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily
as ultrafine particles of litter.
**** Corrosion of glass[edit] ****
Glass corrosion
Glass is characterized by a high degree of corrosion-resistance. Because of its
high water-resistance it is often used as primary packaging material in the
pharma industry since most medicines are preserved in a watery solution.[8]
Besides its water-resistance, glass is also robust when exposed to certain
chemically aggressive liquids or gases.
Glass_disease is the corrosion of silicate glasses in aqueous solutions. It is
governed by two mechanisms: diffusion-controlled leaching (ion exchange) and
hydrolytic dissolution of the glass network.[9] Both mechanisms strongly depend
on the pH of contacting solution: the rate of ion exchange decreases with pH as
10â0.5pH whereas the rate of hydrolytic dissolution increases with pH as
100.5pH.[10]
Mathematically, corrosion rates of glasses are characterized by normalized
corrosion rates of elements NRi (g/cm2Â·d) which are determined as the ratio of
total amount of released species into the water Mi (g) to the water-contacting
surface area S (cm2), time of contact t (days) and weight fraction content of
the element in the glass fi:
           N R   i   =    M  i    S  f  i   t      {\displaystyle \mathrm {NR}
      _{i}={\frac {M_{i}}{Sf_{i}t}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {NR} _{i}={\frac
      {M_{i}}{Sf_{i}t}}}].
The overall corrosion rate is a sum of contributions from both mechanisms
(leaching + dissolution) NRi=NRxi+NRh. Diffusion-controlled leaching (ion
exchange) is characteristic of the initial phase of corrosion and involves
replacement of alkali ions in the glass by a hydronium (H3O+) ion from the
solution. It causes an ion-selective depletion of near surface layers of
glasses and gives an inverse square root dependence of corrosion rate with
exposure time. The diffusion-controlled normalized leaching rate of cations
from glasses (g/cm2Â·d) is given by:
          N R   x  i   = 2 &#x03C1;     D  i    &#x03C0; t       {\displaystyle
      \mathrm {NR} x_{i}=2\rho {\sqrt {\frac {D_{i}}{\pi t}}}}  [{\displaystyle
      \mathrm {NR} x_{i}=2\rho {\sqrt {\frac {D_{i}}{\pi t}}}}],
where t is time, Di is the i-th cation effective diffusion coefficient (cm2/d),
which depends on pH of contacting water as Di = Di0Â·10âpH, and Ï is the
density of the glass (g/cm3).
Glass network dissolution is characteristic of the later phases of corrosion
and causes a congruent release of ions into the water solution at a time-
independent rate in dilute solutions (g/cm2Â·d):
          N R  h = &#x03C1;  r  h     {\displaystyle \mathrm {NR} h=\rho r_{h}}
      [{\displaystyle \mathrm {NR} h=\rho r_{h}}],
where rh is the stationary hydrolysis (dissolution) rate of the glass (cm/d).
In closed systems the consumption of protons from the aqueous phase increases
the pH and causes a fast transition to hydrolysis.[11] However, a further
saturation of solution with silica impedes hydrolysis and causes the glass to
return to an ion-exchange, e.g. diffusion-controlled regime of corrosion.
In typical natural conditions normalized corrosion rates of silicate glasses
are very low and are of the order of 10â7â10â5 g/(cm2Â·d). The very high
durability of silicate glasses in water makes them suitable for hazardous and
nuclear waste immobilisation.
*** Glass corrosion tests[edit] ***
Effect of addition of a certain glass component on the chemical durability
against water corrosion of a specific base glass (corrosion test ISO 719).[12]
There exist numerous standardized procedures for measuring the corrosion (also
called chemical durability) of glasses in neutral, basic, and acidic
environments, under simulated environmental conditions, in simulated body
fluid, at high temperature and pressure,[13] and under other conditions.
The standard procedure ISO 719[14] describes a test of the extraction of water-
soluble basic compounds under neutral conditions: 2 g of glass, particle size
300â500 Î¼m, is kept for 60 min in 50 ml de-ionized water of grade 2 at
98 Â°C; 25 ml of the obtained solution is titrated against 0.01 mol/l HCl
solution. The volume of HCl required for neutralization is classified according
to the table below.
Amount of 0.01M HCl needed to neutralize extracted Extracted Na2O    Hydrolytic
basic oxides, ml                                   equivalent, Î¼g class
< 0.1                                              < 31              1
0.1-0.2                                            31-62             2
0.2-0.85                                           62-264            3
0.85-2.0                                           264-620           4
2.0-3.5                                            620-1085          5
> 3.5                                              > 1085            > 5
The standardized test ISO 719 is not suitable for glasses with poor or not
extractable alkaline components, but which are still attacked by water, e.g.
quartz glass, B2O3 glass or P2O5 glass.
Usual glasses are differentiated into the following classes:
Hydrolytic class 1 (Type I):
This class, which is also called neutral glass, includes borosilicate_glasses
(e.g. Duran, Pyrex, Fiolax).
Glass of this class contains essential quantities of boron_oxides, aluminium
oxides and alkaline_earth_oxides. Through its composition neutral glass has a
high resistance against temperature shocks and the highest hydrolytic
resistance. Against acid and neutral solutions it shows high chemical
resistance, because of its poor alkali content against alkaline solutions.
Hydrolytic class 2 (Type II):
This class usually contains sodium silicate glasses with a high hydrolytic
resistance through surface finishing. Sodium silicate glass is a silicate
glass, which contains alkali- and alkaline_earth_oxide and primarily sodium
oxide and Calcium_oxide.
Hydrolytic class 3 (Type III):
Glass of the 3rd hydrolytic class usually contains sodium silicate glasses and
has a mean hydrolytic resistance, which is two times poorer than of type 1
glasses.
Acid class DIN 12116 and alkali class DIN 52322 (ISO 695) are to be
distinguished from the hydrolytic class DIN 12111 (ISO 719).
