Interdisciplinary field which deals with discovery and design of new materials,
primarily of physical and chemical properties of solids

The interdisciplinary field of materials science, also commonly termed
materials science and engineering is the design and discovery of new materials,
particularly solids. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from
the Enlightenment, when researchers began to use analytical thinking from
chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand ancient, phenomenological
observations in metallurgy and mineralogy.[1][2] Materials science still
incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the
field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these
related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more
widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering,
and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of
the study, within either the Science or Engineering schools, hence the naming.
      Materials science is a syncretic discipline hybridizing metallurgy,
      ceramics, solid-state_physics, and chemistry. It is the first example of
      a new academic discipline emerging by fusion rather than fission.[3]
Many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to
the limits of the materials that are available and how they are used. Thus,
breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of
technology significantly.[4][5]
Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (its
processing) influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and
performance. The understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships
is called the Â§ materials_paradigm. This paradigm is used to advance
understanding in a variety of research areas, including nanotechnology,
biomaterials, and metallurgy. Materials science is also an important part of
forensic_engineering and failure_analysis – investigating materials, products,
structures or components which fail or do not function as intended, causing
personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to
understanding, for example, the causes of various aviation_accidents_and
incidents.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_materials_science
A late Bronze_Age_sword or dagger blade
The material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phrases such
as Stone_Age, Bronze_Age, Iron_Age, and Steel_Age are historic, if arbitrary
examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of ceramics and its putative
derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of
engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from
metallurgy, which itself evolved from mining and (likely) ceramics and earlier
from the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials
occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist Josiah_Willard
Gibbs demonstrated that the thermodynamic properties related to atomic
structure in various phases are related to the physical properties of a
material. Important elements of modern materials science were products of the
Space_Race: the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys, and
silica and carbon materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the
exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the
development of revolutionary technologies such as rubbers, plastics,
semiconductors, and biomaterials.
Before the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many eventual materials
science departments were metallurgy or ceramics engineering departments,
reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals and ceramics. The
growth of materials science in the United States was catalyzed in part by the
Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency, which funded a series of university-hosted
laboratories in the early 1960s "to expand the national program of basic
research and training in the materials sciences."[6] The field has since
broadened to include every class of materials, including ceramics, polymers,
semiconductors, magnetic materials, biomaterials, and nanomaterials, generally
classified into three distinct groups: ceramics, metals, and polymers. The
prominent change in materials science during the recent decades is active usage
of computer simulations to find new materials, predict properties, and
understand phenomena.
***** Fundamentals[edit] *****
The materials paradigm represented in the form of a tetrahedron
A material is defined as a substance (most often a solid, but other condensed
phases can be included) that is intended to be used for certain applications.
[7] There are a myriad of materials around usâthey can be found in anything
from buildings to spacecraft. Materials can generally be further divided into
two classes: crystalline and non-crystalline. The traditional examples of
materials are metals, semiconductors, ceramics and polymers.[8] New and
advanced materials that are being developed include nanomaterials,
biomaterials,[9] and energy_materials to name a few.
The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials,
and relating them to their properties. Once a materials scientist knows about
this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative
performance of a material in a given application. The major determinants of the
structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical
elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These
characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of thermodynamics
and kinetics, govern a material's microstructure, and thus its properties.
**** Structure[edit] ****
As mentioned above, structure is one of the most important components of the
field of materials science. Materials science examines the structure of
materials from the atomic scale, all the way up to the macro scale.
Characterization is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a
material. This involves methods such as diffraction with X-rays, electrons, or
neutrons, and various forms of spectroscopy and chemical_analysis such as Raman
spectroscopy, energy-dispersive_spectroscopy (EDS), chromatography, thermal
analysis, electron_microscope analysis, etc. Structure is studied at various
levels, as detailed below.
*** Atomic structure[edit] ***
This deals with the atoms of the materials, and how they are arranged to give
molecules, crystals, etc. Much of the electrical, magnetic and chemical
properties of materials arise from this level of structure. The length scales
involved are in angstroms(Ã). The way in which the atoms and molecules are
bonded and arranged is fundamental to studying the properties and behavior of
any material.
*** Nanostructure[edit] ***
Main article: Nanostructure
Buckminsterfullerene nanostructure
Nanostructure deals with objects and structures that are in the 1â100 nm
range.[10] In many materials, atoms or molecules agglomerate together to form
objects at the nanoscale. This causes many interesting electrical, magnetic,
optical, and mechanical properties.
In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the
number of dimensions on the nanoscale. Nanotextured_surfaces have one dimension
on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is
between 0.1 and 100 nm. Nanotubes have two dimensions on the nanoscale, i.e.,
the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100 nm; its length could be much
greater. Finally, spherical nanoparticles have three dimensions on the
nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100 nm in each spatial
dimension. The terms nanoparticles and ultrafine_particles (UFP) often are used
synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term
'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology. Nanoscale
structure in biology is often called ultrastructure.
Materials which atoms and molecules form constituents in the nanoscale (i.e.,
they form nanostructure) are called nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are subject of
intense research in the materials science community due to the unique
properties that they exhibit.
*** Microstructure[edit] ***
Main article: Microstructure
Microstructure of pearlite
Microstructure is defined as the structure of a prepared surface or thin foil
of material as revealed by a microscope above 25Ã magnification. It deals with
objects from 100 nm to a few cm. The microstructure of a material (which can be
broadly classified into metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite) can
strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility,
hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behavior, wear resistance,
and so on. Most of the traditional materials (such as metals and ceramics) are
microstructured.
The manufacture of a perfect crystal of a material is physically impossible.
For example, any crystalline material will contain defects such as
precipitates, grain boundaries (HallâPetch_relationship), vacancies,
interstitial atoms or substitutional atoms. The microstructure of materials
reveals these larger defects, so that they can be studied, with significant
advances in simulation resulting in exponentially increasing understanding of
how defects can be used to enhance material properties.
*** Macro structure[edit] ***
Macro structure is the appearance of a material in the scale millimeters to
metersâit is the structure of the material as seen with the naked eye.
**** Crystallography[edit] ****
Main article: Crystallography
Crystal structure of a perovskite with a chemical formula ABX3[11]
Crystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in
crystalline solids. Crystallography is a useful tool for materials scientists.
In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is
often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals
reflect the atomic structure. Further, physical properties are often controlled
by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important
prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects. Mostly, materials do
not occur as a single crystal, but in polycrystalline form, i.e., as an
aggregate of small crystals with different orientations. Because of this, the
powder diffraction method, which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline
samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural
determination. Most materials have a crystalline structure, but some important
materials do not exhibit regular crystal structure. Polymers display varying
degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely noncrystalline. Glass, some
ceramics, and many natural materials are amorphous, not possessing any long-
range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines
elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic and
mechanical, descriptions of physical properties.
**** Bonding[edit] ****
Main article: Chemical_bonding
To obtain a full understanding of the material structure and how it relates to
its properties, the materials scientist must study how the different atoms,
ions and molecules are arranged and bonded to each other. This involves the
study and use of quantum_chemistry or quantum_physics. Solid-state_physics,
solid-state_chemistry and physical_chemistry are also involved in the study of
bonding and structure.
**** Properties[edit] ****
Main article: List_of_materials_properties
Materials exhibit myriad properties, including the following.
          * Mechanical properties, see Strength_of_materials
          * Chemical properties, see Chemistry
          * Electrical properties, see Electricity
          * Thermal properties, see Thermodynamics
          * Optical properties, see Optics and Photonics
          * Magnetic properties, see Magnetism
The properties of a material determine its usability and hence its engineering
application.
**** Synthesis and processing[edit] ****
Synthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired
micro-nanostructure. From an engineering standpoint, a material cannot be used
in industry if no economical production method for it has been developed. Thus,
the processing of materials is vital to the field of materials science.
Different materials require different processing or synthesis methods. For
example, the processing of metals has historically been very important and is
studied under the branch of materials science named physical metallurgy. Also,
chemical and physical methods are also used to synthesize other materials such
as polymers, ceramics, thin_films, etc. As of the early 21st century, new
methods are being developed to synthesize nanomaterials such as graphene.
**** Thermodynamics[edit] ****
Main article: Thermodynamics
A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point
Thermodynamics is concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to
energy and work. It defines macroscopic variables, such as internal_energy,
entropy, and pressure, that partly describe a body of matter or radiation. It
states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints
common to all materials. These general constraints are expressed in the four
laws of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body,
not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic
constituents, such as molecules. The behavior of these microscopic particles is
described by, and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from, statistical
mechanics.
The study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science. It forms the
foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering,
including chemical reactions, magnetism, polarizability, and elasticity. It
also helps in the understanding of phase diagrams and phase equilibrium.
**** Kinetics[edit] ****
Main article: Chemical_kinetics
Chemical_kinetics is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of
equilibrium change under the influence of various forces. When applied to
materials science, it deals with how a material changes with time (moves from
non-equilibrium to equilibrium state) due to application of a certain field. It
details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape,
size, composition and structure. Diffusion is important in the study of
kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo
change.
Kinetics is essential in processing of materials because, among other things,
it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat.
***** In research[edit] *****
Materials science has received much attention from researchers. In most
universities, many departments ranging from physics to chemistry to chemical
engineering, along with materials science departments, are involved in
materials research. Research in materials science covers a broad range of
topics â the following non-exhaustive list highlights a few important
research areas.
**** Nanomaterials[edit] ****
Main article: Nanomaterials
A scanning_electron_microscopy image of carbon nanotubes bundles
Nanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized
(in at least one dimension) between 1 and 1000 nanometers (10â9 meter) but is
usually 1â100 nm.
Nanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to
nanotechnology, using advances in materials metrology and synthesis which have
been developed in support of microfabrication research. Materials with
structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical, electronic, or mechanical
properties.
The field of nanomaterials is loosely organized, like the traditional field of
chemistry, into organic (carbon-based) nanomaterials such as fullerenes, and
inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements, such as silicon. Examples of
nanomaterials include fullerenes, carbon_nanotubes, nanocrystals, etc.
**** Biomaterials[edit] ****
Main article: Biomaterial
The iridescent nacre inside a nautilus shell
A biomaterial is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with
biological systems. The study of biomaterials is called bio materials science.
It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many
companies investing large amounts of money into developing new products.
Biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine, biology, chemistry,
tissue_engineering, and materials science.
Biomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in a laboratory
using a variety of chemical approaches using metallic components, polymers,
bioceramics, or composite_materials. They are often intended or adapted for
medical applications, such as biomedical devices which perform, augment, or
replace a natural function. Such functions may be benign, like being used for a
heart_valve, or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as
hydroxylapatite coated hip_implants. Biomaterials are also used every day in
dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with
impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits
the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial
may also be an autograft, allograft or xenograft used as an organ_transplant
material.
**** Electronic, optical, and magnetic[edit] ****
Negative_index_metamaterial[12][13]
Semiconductors, metals, and ceramics are used today to form highly complex
systems, such as integrated electronic circuits, optoelectronic devices, and
magnetic and optical mass storage media. These materials form the basis of our
modern computing world, and hence research into these materials is of vital
importance.
Semiconductors are a traditional example of these types of materials. They are
materials that have properties that are intermediate between conductors and
insulators. Their electrical conductivities are very sensitive to the
concentration of impurities, which allows the use of doping to achieve
desirable electronic properties. Hence, semiconductors form the basis of the
traditional computer.
This field also includes new areas of research such as superconducting
materials, spintronics, metamaterials, etc. The study of these materials
involves knowledge of materials science and solid-state_physics or condensed
matter_physics.
**** Computational materials science and engineering[edit] ****
With continuing increases in computing power, simulating the behavior of
materials has become possible. This enables materials scientists to understand
behavior and mechanisms, design new materials, and explain properties formerly
poorly understood. Efforts surrounding Integrated_computational_materials
engineering are now focusing on combining computational methods with
experiments to drastically reduce the time and effort to optimize materials
properties for a given application. This involves simulating materials at all
length scales, using methods such as density_functional_theory, molecular
dynamics, Monte_Carlo_algorithm, dislocation dynamics, Phase_field_models,
Finite_element_method, and many more.
***** In industry[edit] *****
Radical materials_advances can drive the creation of new products or even new
industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make
incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials.
Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-
benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods
(casting, rolling, welding, ion_implantation, crystal_growth, thin-film
deposition, sintering, glassblowing, etc.), and analytic methods
(characterization methods such as electron_microscopy, X-ray_diffraction,
calorimetry, nuclear_microscopy_(HEFIB), Rutherford_backscattering, neutron
diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.).
Besides material characterization, the material scientist or engineer also
deals with extracting materials and converting them into useful forms. Thus
ingot casting, foundry methods, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic
extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer.
Often the presence, absence, or variation of minute quantities of secondary
elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final
properties of the materials produced. For example, steels are classified based
on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements
they contain. Thus, the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron
in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced.
**** Ceramics and glasses[edit] ****
Main article: Ceramic
Si3N4 ceramic bearing parts
Another application of material science is the structures of ceramics and glass
typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and
glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with SiO2 (silica or sand) as a
fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone
and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a
metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the
material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous
state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers
of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning Gorilla_Glass is a well-
known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve
the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form
are considered to be ceramics.
Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high
temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, silicon_carbide, and
tungsten_carbide are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process
of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material.
Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material.
Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of
tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and
nickel typically added to modify properties.
**** Composites[edit] ****
Main article: Composite_material
A 6 Î¼m diameter carbon filament (running from bottom left to top right) siting
atop the much larger human hair
Filaments are commonly used for reinforcement in composite_materials.
Another application of materials science in industry is making composite
materials. These are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic
phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced
concrete, to the thermal insulating tiles which play a key and integral role in
NASA's Space_Shuttle_thermal_protection_system which is used to protect the
surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
One example is reinforced_Carbon-Carbon (RCC), the light gray material which
withstands re-entry temperatures up to 1,510 Â°C (2,750 Â°F) and protects the
Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite
material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic_resin.
After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to
convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum
chamber, and cured-pyrolized to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon. To
provide oxidation resistance for reuse ability, the outer layers of the RCC are
converted to silicon_carbide.
Other examples can be seen in the "plastic" casings of television sets, cell-
phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a composite_material made
up of a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene (ABS) in
which calcium_carbonate chalk, talc, glass_fibers or carbon_fibers have been
added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion. These additions
may be termed reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.
**** Polymers[edit] ****
Main article: Polymer
The repeating unit of the polymer polypropylene
Expanded polystyrene polymer packaging
Polymers are chemical compounds made up of a large number of identical
components linked together like chains. They are an important part of materials
science. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are
commonly called plastics and rubber. Plastics and rubber are really the final
product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a
resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics which
have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include
polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl_chloride (PVC), polystyrene, nylons,
polyesters, acrylics, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates and also rubbers which
have been around are natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, chloroprene, and
butadiene_rubber. Plastics are generally classified as commodity, specialty and
engineering_plastics.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production
quantities are large. It lends itself to a vast array of applications, from
artificial_leather to electrical_insulation and cabling, packaging, and
containers. Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The
versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of plasticisers and other additives
that it accepts. The term "additives" in polymer science refers to the
chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material
properties.
Polycarbonate would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other
examples include PEEK, ABS). Such plastics are valued for their superior
strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for
disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics.
Specialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-
high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal
stability, etc.
The dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on
material but rather on their properties and applications. For example,
polyethylene (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make
disposable bags for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic,
whereas medium-density_polyethylene (MDPE) is used for underground gas and
water pipes, and another variety called ultra-high-molecular-weight
polyethylene (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as
the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in
implanted hip_joints.
**** Metal alloys[edit] ****
Main article: Alloy
Wire rope made from steel alloy
The study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science. Of all
the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless_steel,
cast_iron, tool_steel, alloy_steels) make up the largest proportion both by
quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon
gives low, mid and high_carbon_steels. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered
steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the
hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon
present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and
toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can
significantly change these properties, however. Cast Iron is defined as an
ironâcarbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless
steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight
alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in
stainless steels.
Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium, titanium, copper and
magnesium. Copper_alloys have been known for a long time (since the Bronze
Age), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently
developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic
extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The
alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their
high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to
provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations
where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as
in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.
**** Semiconductors[edit] ****
The study of semiconductors is a significant part of materials science. A
semiconductor is a material that has a resistivity between a metal and
insulator. Its electronic properties can be greatly altered through
intentionally introducing impurities or doping. From these semiconductor
materials, things such as diodes, transistors, light-emitting_diodes (LEDs),
and analog and digital electric_circuits can be built, making them materials of
interest in industry. Semiconductor devices have replaced thermionic devices
(vacuum tubes) in most applications. Semiconductor devices are manufactured
both as single discrete devices and as integrated_circuits (ICs), which consist
of a numberâfrom a few to millionsâof devices manufactured and
interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate.[14]
Of all the semiconductors in use today, silicon makes up the largest portion
both by quantity and commercial value. Monocrystalline silicon is used to
produce wafers used in the semiconductor and electronics industry. Second to
silicon, gallium_arsenide (GaAs) is the second most popular semiconductor used.
Due to its higher electron mobility and saturation velocity compared to
silicon, it is a material of choice for high-speed electronics applications.
These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in
mobile phones, satellite communications, microwave point-to-point links and
higher frequency radar systems. Other semiconductor materials include
germanium, silicon_carbide, and gallium_nitride and have various applications.
***** Relation with other fields[edit] *****
Materials science evolvedâstarting from the 1950sâbecause it was recognized
that to create, discover and design new materials, one had to approach it in a
unified manner. Thus, materials science and engineering emerged in many ways:
renaming and/or combining existing metallurgy and ceramics_engineering
departments; splitting from existing solid_state_physics research, itself
growing into condensed_matter_physics); pulling in relatively new polymer
engineering and polymer_science; recombining from the previous, as well as
chemistry, chemical_engineering, mechanical_engineering, and electrical
engineering; and more.
The field is inherently interdisciplinary, and the materials scientists/
engineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist, chemist
and engineer. The field thus maintains close relationships with these fields.
Also, many physicists, chemists and engineers also find themselves working in
materials science.
The field of materials science and engineering is important both from a
scientific perspective, as well as from an engineering one. When discovering
new materials, one encounters new phenomena that may not have been observed
before. Hence, there is a lot of science to be discovered when working with
materials. Materials science also provides a test for theories in condensed
matter physics.
Materials are of the utmost importance for engineers, as the usage of the
appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems. As a result, materials
science is an increasingly important part of an engineer's education.
