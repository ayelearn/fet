****** Failure analysis ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Failure analysis is the process of collecting and analyzing data to determine
the cause of a failure, often with the goal of determining corrective actions
or liability. According to Bloch and Geitner, machinery failures reveal a
reaction chain of cause and effectâ¦ usually a deficiency commonly referred to
as the symptomâ¦â.[1] failure analysis can save money, lives, and resources
if done correctly and acted upon. It is an important discipline in many
branches of manufacturing industry, such as the electronics industry, where it
is a vital tool used in the development of new products and for the improvement
of existing products. The failure analysis process relies on collecting failed
components for subsequent examination of the cause or causes of failure using a
wide array of methods, especially microscopy and spectroscopy. Nondestructive
testing (NDT) methods (such as industrial_computed_tomography_scanning) are
valuable because the failed products are unaffected by analysis, so inspection
sometimes starts using these methods.

***** Forensic investigation[edit] *****
Forensic inquiry into the failed process or product is the starting point of
failure analysis. Such inquiry is conducted using scientific analytical methods
such as electrical and mechanical measurements, or by analyzing failure data
such as product reject reports or examples of previous failures of the same
kind. The methods of forensic_engineering are especially valuable in tracing
product defects and flaws. They may include fatigue cracks, brittle cracks
produced by stress_corrosion_cracking or environmental_stress_cracking for
example. Witness statements can be valuable for reconstructing the likely
sequence of events and hence the chain of cause and effect. Human factors can
also be assessed when the cause of the failure is determined. There are several
useful methods to prevent product failures occurring in the first place,
including failure_mode_and_effects_analysis_(FMEA) and fault_tree_analysis_
(FTA), methods which can be used during prototyping to analyze failures before
a product is marketed.
Several of the techniques used in failure analysis are also used in the
analysis of no_fault_found_(NFF) which is a term used in the field of
maintenance to describe a situation where an originally reported mode of
failure can't be duplicated by the evaluating technician and therefore the
potential defect can't be fixed.
NFF can be attributed to oxidation, defective connections of electrical
components, temporary shorts or opens in the circuits, software bugs, temporary
environmental factors, but also to the operator error. A large number of
devices that are reported as NFF during the first troubleshooting session often
return to the failure analysis lab with the same NFF symptoms or a permanent
mode of failure.
The term failure analysis also applies to other fields such as business
management and military strategy.
***** Failure analysis engineers[edit] *****
A failure analysis engineer often plays a lead role in the analysis of
failures, whether a component or product fails in service or if failure occurs
in manufacturing or during production processing. In any case, one must
determine the cause of failure to prevent future occurrence, and/or to improve
the performance of the device, component or structure. Structural Engineers and
Mechanical Engineers are very common for the job. More specific majors can also
get into the position such as materials engineers. Specializing in metallurgy
and chemistry is always useful along with properties and strengths of
materials. Someone could be hired for different reasons, whether it be to
further prevent or liability issues. The median salary of a failure analysis
engineer, an engineer with experience in the field, is $81,647.[2] A failure
analysis engineer requires a good amount of communication and ability to work
with others. Usually, the person hired, has a bachelors in engineering but
there are certifications that can be acquired.[2]

***** Case Studies[edit] *****
**** Two Shear Key Rods failed on the Bay Bridge[edit] ****
*** People on the Case[edit] ***
Mr. Brahimi is an American Bridge Fluor consultant and has a Masters in
materials engineering.[3]
Mr. Aguilar is the Branch Chief for Caltrans Structural Materials Testing
Branch with 30 yearsâ experience as an engineer.[3]
Mr. Christensen who is a Caltrans consultant with 32 years of experience with
metallurgy and failure analysis.[3]
*** Steps[edit] ***
Visual Observation which is non-destructive examination. This revealed sign of
brittleness with no permanent plastic deformation before it broke. Cracks were
shown which were the final breaking point of the shear key rods. The engineers
suspected hydrogen was involved in producing the cracks.[3]
Scanning Electron Microscopy which is the scanning of the cracked surfaces
under high magnification to get a better understanding of the fracture. The
full fracture happened after the rod couldnât hold under load when the crack
reached a critical size.[3]
Micro Structural Examination where cross-sections were examined to reveal more
information about interworking bonds of the metal.[3]
Hardness Testing using two strategies, the Rockwell C Hardness and the Knoop
Microhardness which reveals that it was not heat treated correctly.[3]
Tensile Test tells the engineer the yield strength, tensile strength, and
elongation was sufficient to pass the requirements. Multiple pieces were taken
and performed by Anamet Inc.[3]
Charpy V-Notch Impact Test shows the toughness of the steel by taking different
samples of the rod and done by Anamet Inc.[3]
Chemical Analysis was the Final Test also done by Anamet Inc. which met the
requirements for that steel.[3]
*** Conclusion of the Case Study[edit] ***
The rods failed from hydrogen embrittlement which was susceptible to the
hydrogen from the high tensile load and the hydrogen already in the material.
The rods did not fail because they did not meet the requirements for strength
in these rods. While they met requirements, the structure was inhomogeneous
which caused different strengths and low toughness.[3]
This study shows a couple of the many ways failure analysis can be done. It
always starts with a nondestructive form of observation, like a crime scene.
Then pieces of the material are taken from the original piece which are used in
different observations. Then destructive testing is done to find toughness and
properties of the material to find exactly what went wrong.[3]
**** Failure of failure analysis[edit] ****
The collapse of the Oakland Nimitz Freeway was a bridge that collapsed during
an earthquake even after the program to strengthen the bridge. Different
engineers were asked on their take on the situation. While some donât blame
the program or the department, like James Rogers who said that the earthquake
could have âa good chance the Embarcadero would do the same thing the Nimitz
did.â[4] While some said more prevention couldâve been done. Dr. Priestly
says that âneither of the departmentâs projects to strengthen roadways
addressed the problems of weaknessâ¦â in the bridges joints. Some experts
agreed that more couldâve been done to prevent this disaster. The program is
under fire for making âthe failure more seriousâ.[4]
**** From a design engineer's POV[edit] ****
[File:F101 - T-9 Jet Engine Test Cell.ogv]Play_media
Jet Engine Test Cell[5]
A product needs to be able to work even in the hardest of scenarios. This is
very important on products made for expensive builds such as buildings or
aircraft. If these parts fail, they can cause serious damage and/or safety
problems. A product starts to be designed "...to minimize the hazards
associated with this "worst case scenario." Discerning the worst case scenario
requires a complete understanding of the product, its loading and its service
environment. Prior to the product entering service, a prototype will often
undergo laboratory testing which proves the product withstands the worst case
scenario as expected."[6] Some of the tests done on jet engines today are very
intensive checking if the engine can withstand:
    * ingestion of debris, dust, sand, etc.;[7]
    * ingestion of hail, snow, ice, etc.;[7]
    * ingestion of excessive amounts of water.[7]
These tests must be harder than what the product will experience in use. The
engines are pushed to the max in order to ensure that the product will function
the way it should no matter the condition. Failure analysis on both sides is
about the prevention of damage and maintaining safety.
