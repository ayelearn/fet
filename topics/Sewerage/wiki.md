Not to be confused with Sewage.
Map of London sewer network, late 19th century
Sewerage is the infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface_runoff
(stormwater, meltwater, rainwater) using sewers. It encompasses components such
as receiving drains, manholes, pumping_stations, storm overflows, and screening
chambers of the combined_sewer or sanitary_sewer. Sewerage ends at the entry to
a sewage_treatment_plant or at the point of discharge into the environment. It
is the system of pipes, chambers, manholes, etc. that conveys the sewage or
storm water.
It is also an alternate noun for the word sewage.
In American colloquial English, "sewer system" is applied more frequently to
the large infrastructure of sewers that British speakers more often refer to as
"sewerage".

***** Components and types[edit] *****
Map of Seattle sewer districts, 1894
The main part of such a system is made up of large pipes (i.e. the sewers, or
"sanitary_sewers") that convey the sewage from the point of production to the
point of treatment or discharge.

Types of sanitary sewer systems that all usually are gravity_sewers include:
    * Combined_sewer
    * Simplified_sewerage
    * Storm_drain
Sanitary sewers not relying solely on gravity include:
    * Vacuum_sewer
    * Effluent_sewer
***** Maintenance and rehabilitation[edit] *****
Severe constraints are applied to sewerage, which may result in premature
deterioration. These include root intrusion, joint displacement, cracks, and
hole formations that lead to a significant volume of leakage with an overall
risk for the environment and public health. For example, it is estimated that
500 million m3 of contaminated water per year can leak into soil and ground-
water in Germany.[1] The rehabilitation and replacement of damaged sewers is
very costly. Annual rehabilitation costs for Los Angeles County are about
â¬400 million,[2] and in Germany, these costs are estimated to be â¬100
million.[3]
Vacuuming debris from a sewer line
Hydrogen_sulfide (H2S) is indirectly responsible for biogenic_sulfide_corrosion
and consequently, sewers need rehabilitation work. Various repair options are
available to owners over a large range of costs and potential durability. One
option is the application of a cementitious material based on calcium_aluminate
cement, after a cleaning of the corroded structure to remove loose material and
contaminants in order to expose a sound, rough and clean substrate. Depending
on the concrete condition and contamination, the cleaning can range from simple
high pressure jet water cleaning (200 bar) up to real hydro-demolition (2000
bars).
One method to ensure sound concrete is exposed is to verify that the surface pH
is superior to 10.
As for any concrete repair, the state-of-the-art rules must be followed. After
this cleaning step, the cementitious material is applied to the saturated-
surface-dry substrate using either:
    * Low pressure wet spray: this method is the more common because it does
      not produce dust and virtually no material is lost by rebound. It
      utilizes classical facade rotor pump, easily available in the market. The
      main drawback is the limited pumping distance that cannot exceed 75
      meters.
    * Spinning head wet spray: this method is similar to the first, but the
      manual spraying is replaced by a spinning head projecting the mortar onto
      the repaired surface. This method is fast and especially suited for
      cylindrical chambers such as manholes. When a structure is so severely
      corroded that human entry is a risk, spinning head application permits an
      âun-mannedâ consolidation of the manhole.
    * High pressure dry spray: this method, also called âshotcreteâ or
      âguniteâ is allowing a faster rate of rehabilitation, and also to
      make a thicker application in a single pass. The main interest of dry
      shotcrete is the capacity to pump the mortar over a long distance and
      this is needed when the access points are distant. Perhaps the longest
      dry shotcrete distance is a job site in Australia in 2014, where 100%
      calcium_aluminate mortar was air transported over 800 meters before being
      sprayed. The main drawback with dry shotcrete is the generation of dust
      and rebound; these could be limited and controlled with appropriate means
      (pre-moisture ring, adapted aggregate grading, experienced nozzleman,
      water mist cut-off walls, etc.).
***** Challenges[edit] *****
Building a sewer in newly filled land on former tideflats in Seattle, 1910.
**** Water table[edit] ****
Sewer system infrastructure often reduces the water_table in areas, especially
in densely populated areas where rainwater (from house roofs) is directly piped
into the system, as opposed to being allowed to be absorbed by the soil. In
certain areas it has resulted in a significant lowering of the water table. In
the example of Belgium, a lowering of the water table by 100 meters has been
the result.[4][5] The freshwater that is accumulated by the system is then
piped to the sea.
In areas where this is a concern, vacuum_sewers may be used instead, due to the
shallow excavation that is possible for them.
***** Regulations[edit] *****
In many European countries, citizens are obliged to connect their home
sanitation to the national sewerage where possible. This has resulted in large
percentages of the population being connected. For example, the Netherlands
have 99% of the population connected to the system, and 1% has an individual
sewage disposal system or treatment system, e.g., septic_tank. Others have
slightly lower (although still substantial) percentages; e.g., 96% for Germany.
