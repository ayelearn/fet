Shortest path (A, C, E, D, F) between vertices A and F in the weighted directed
graph
In graph_theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path
between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of
its constituent edges is minimized.
The problem of finding the shortest path between two intersections on a road
map may be modeled as a special case of the shortest path problem in graphs,
where the vertices correspond to intersections and the edges correspond to road
segments, each weighted by the length of the segment.

***** Definition[edit] *****
The shortest path problem can be defined for graphs whether undirected,
directed, or mixed. It is defined here for undirected graphs; for directed
graphs the definition of path requires that consecutive vertices be connected
by an appropriate directed edge.
Two vertices are adjacent when they are both incident to a common edge. A path
in an undirected graph is a sequence of vertices     P = (  v  1   ,  v  2   ,
&#x2026; ,  v  n   ) &#x2208; V &#x00D7; V &#x00D7; &#x22EF; &#x00D7; V
{\displaystyle P=(v_{1},v_{2},\ldots ,v_{n})\in V\times V\times \cdots \times
V}  [{\displaystyle P=(v_{1},v_{2},\ldots ,v_{n})\in V\times V\times \cdots
\times V}] such that      v  i     {\displaystyle v_{i}}  [v_{i}] is adjacent
to      v  i + 1     {\displaystyle v_{i+1}}  [v_{i+1}] for     1 &#x2264; i <
n   {\displaystyle 1\leq i<n}  [1\leq i<n]. Such a path     P   {\displaystyle
P}  [P] is called a path of length     n &#x2212; 1   {\displaystyle n-1}  [n-
1] from      v  1     {\displaystyle v_{1}}  [v_{1}] to      v  n
{\displaystyle v_{n}}  [v_{n}]. (The      v  i     {\displaystyle v_{i}}  [v_
{i}] are variables; their numbering here relates to their position in the
sequence and needs not to relate to any canonical labeling of the vertices.)
Let      e  i , j     {\displaystyle e_{i,j}}  [e_{i,j}] be the edge incident
to both      v  i     {\displaystyle v_{i}}  [v_{i}] and      v  j
{\displaystyle v_{j}}  [v_{j}]. Given a real-valued weight function     f : E
&#x2192;  R    {\displaystyle f:E\rightarrow \mathbb {R} }  [f:E\rightarrow
\mathbb {R} ], and an undirected (simple) graph     G   {\displaystyle G}  [G],
the shortest path from     v   {\displaystyle v}  [v] to      v &#x2032;
{\displaystyle v'}  [v'] is the path     P = (  v  1   ,  v  2   , &#x2026; ,
v  n   )   {\displaystyle P=(v_{1},v_{2},\ldots ,v_{n})}  [P=(v_{1},v_
{2},\ldots ,v_{n})] (where      v  1   = v   {\displaystyle v_{1}=v}  [v_{1}=v]
and      v  n   =  v &#x2032;    {\displaystyle v_{n}=v'}  [v_{n}=v']) that
over all possible     n   {\displaystyle n}  [n] minimizes the sum
&#x2211;  i = 1   n &#x2212; 1   f (  e  i , i + 1   ) .   {\displaystyle \sum
_{i=1}^{n-1}f(e_{i,i+1}).}  [\sum _{i=1}^{n-1}f(e_{i,i+1}).] When each edge in
the graph has unit weight or     f : E &#x2192; { 1 }   {\displaystyle f:
E\rightarrow \{1\}}  [f:E\rightarrow \{1\}], this is equivalent to finding the
path with fewest edges.
The problem is also sometimes called the single-pair shortest path problem, to
distinguish it from the following variations:
    * The single-source shortest path problem, in which we have to find
      shortest paths from a source vertex v to all other vertices in the graph.
    * The single-destination shortest path problem, in which we have to find
      shortest paths from all vertices in the directed graph to a single
      destination vertex v. This can be reduced to the single-source shortest
      path problem by reversing the arcs in the directed graph.
    * The all-pairs shortest path problem, in which we have to find shortest
      paths between every pair of vertices v, v' in the graph.
These generalizations have significantly more efficient algorithms than the
simplistic approach of running a single-pair shortest path algorithm on all
relevant pairs of vertices.
***** Algorithms[edit] *****
The most important algorithms for solving this problem are:
    * Dijkstra's_algorithm solves the single-source shortest path problem with
      non-negative edge weight.
    * Bellman√¢¬Ä¬ìFord_algorithm solves the single-source problem if edge weights
      may be negative.
    * A*_search_algorithm solves for single pair shortest path using heuristics
      to try to speed up the search.
    * Floyd√¢¬Ä¬ìWarshall_algorithm solves all pairs shortest paths.
    * Johnson's_algorithm solves all pairs shortest paths, and may be faster
      than Floyd√¢¬Ä¬ìWarshall on sparse_graphs.
    * Viterbi_algorithm solves the shortest stochastic path problem with an
      additional probabilistic weight on each node.
Additional algorithms and associated evaluations may be found in Cherkassky,
Goldberg_&_Radzik_(1996).

The all-pairs shortest path problem finds the shortest paths between every pair

it could be solved by a linear number of matrix multiplications that takes a
total time of O(V4).

***** Applications[edit] *****
Shortest path algorithms are applied to automatically find directions between
physical locations, such as driving directions on web_mapping websites like
MapQuest or Google_Maps. For this application fast specialized algorithms are
available.[1]
If one represents a nondeterministic abstract_machine as a graph where vertices
describe states and edges describe possible transitions, shortest path
algorithms can be used to find an optimal sequence of choices to reach a
certain goal state, or to establish lower bounds on the time needed to reach a
given state. For example, if vertices represent the states of a puzzle like a
Rubik's_Cube and each directed edge corresponds to a single move or turn,
shortest path algorithms can be used to find a solution that uses the minimum
possible number of moves.
In a networking or telecommunications mindset, this shortest path problem is
sometimes called the min-delay path problem and usually tied with a widest_path
problem. For example, the algorithm may seek the shortest (min-delay) widest
path, or widest shortest (min-delay) path.
A more lighthearted application is the games of "six_degrees_of_separation"
that try to find the shortest path in graphs like movie stars appearing in the
same film.
Other applications, often studied in operations_research, include plant and
facility layout, robotics, transportation, and VLSI design.[2]
**** Road networks[edit] ****
A road network can be considered as a graph with positive weights. The nodes
represent road junctions and each edge of the graph is associated with a road
segment between two junctions. The weight of an edge may correspond to the
length of the associated road segment, the time needed to traverse the segment,
or the cost of traversing the segment. Using directed edges it is also possible
to model one-way streets. Such graphs are special in the sense that some edges
are more important than others for long distance travel (e.g. highways). This
property has been formalized using the notion of highway dimension.[3] There
are a great number of algorithms that exploit this property and are therefore
able to compute the shortest path a lot quicker than would be possible on
general graphs.
All of these algorithms work in two phases. In the first phase, the graph is
preprocessed without knowing the source or target node. The second phase is the
query phase. In this phase, source and target node are known.The idea is that
the road network is static, so the preprocessing phase can be done once and
used for a large number of queries on the same road network.
The algorithm with the fastest known query time is called hub labeling and is
able to compute shortest path on the road networks of Europe or the USA in a
fraction of a microsecond.[4] Other techniques that have been used are:
    * ALT (A* search, landmarks, and triangle_inequality)
    * Arc flags
    * Contraction_hierarchies
    * Transit node routing
    * Reach-based pruning
    * Labeling
    * Hub_labels

The travelling_salesman_problem is the problem of finding the shortest path
that goes through every vertex exactly once, and returns to the start. Unlike
the shortest path problem, which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs
without negative cycles, the travelling salesman problem is NP-complete and, as
such, is believed not to be efficiently solvable for large sets of data (see P
=_NP_problem). The problem of finding_the_longest_path in a graph is also NP-
complete.
The Canadian_traveller_problem and the stochastic shortest path problem are
generalizations where either the graph isn't completely known to the mover,
changes over time, or where actions (traversals) are probabilistic.
The shortest multiple disconnected path [5] is a representation of the
primitive path network within the framework of Reptation_theory.
The widest_path_problem seeks a path so that the minimum label of any edge is
as large as possible.

Sometimes, the edges in a graph have personalities: each edge has its own
selfish interest. An example is a communication network, in which each edge is
a computer that possibly belongs to a different person. Different computers
have different transmission speeds, so every edge in the network has a numeric
weight equal to the number of milliseconds it takes to transmit a message. Our
goal is to send a message between two points in the network in the shortest
time possible. If we know the transmission-time of each computer (the weight of
each edge), then we can use a standard shortest-paths algorithm. If we do not
know the transmission times, then we have to ask each computer to tell us its
transmission-time. But, the computers may be selfish: a computer might tell us
that its transmission time is very long, so that we will not bother it with our
messages. A possible solution to this problem is to use a_variant_of_the_VCG
mechanism, which gives the computers an incentive to reveal their true weights.
***** Linear programming formulation[edit] *****
There is a natural linear_programming formulation for the shortest path
problem, given below. It is very simple compared to most other uses of linear
programs in discrete_optimization, however it illustrates connections to other
concepts.
Given a directed graph (V, A) with source node s, target node t, and cost wij
for each edge (i, j) in A, consider the program with variables xij
      minimize      &#x2211;  i j &#x2208; A    w  i j    x  i j
      {\displaystyle \sum _{ij\in A}w_{ij}x_{ij}}  [\sum _{ij\in A}w_{ij}x_
      {ij}] subject to     x &#x2265; 0   {\displaystyle x\geq 0}  [x\geq 0]
      and for all i,      &#x2211;  j    x  i j   &#x2212;  &#x2211;  j    x  j
      i   =   {    1 ,    if&#xA0;  i = s ;     &#x2212; 1 ,    if&#xA0;  i = t
      ;     0 ,    &#xA0;otherwise.          {\displaystyle \sum _{j}x_{ij}-
      \sum _{j}x_{ji}={\begin{cases}1,&{\text{if }}i=s;\\-1,&{\text{if
      }}i=t;\\0,&{\text{ otherwise.}}\end{cases}}}  [\sum _{j}x_{ij}-\sum _
      {j}x_{ji}={\begin{cases}1,&{\text{if }}i=s;\\-1,&{\text{if }}i=t;\\0,&
      {\text{ otherwise.}}\end{cases}}]
The intuition behind this is that      x  i j     {\displaystyle x_{ij}}  [x_
{ij}] is an indicator variable for whether edge (i, j) is part of the shortest
path: 1 when it is, and 0 if it is not. We wish to select the set of edges with
minimal weight, subject to the constraint that this set forms a path from s to
t (represented by the equality constraint: for all vertices except s and t the
number of incoming and outcoming edges that are part of the path must be the
same (i.e., that it should be a path from s to t).
This LP has the special property that it is integral; more specifically, every
basic_optimal_solution (when one exists) has all variables equal to 0 or 1, and
the set of edges whose variables equal 1 form an s-t dipath. See Ahuja et al.
[6] for one proof, although the origin of this approach dates back to mid-20th
century.
The dual for this linear program is
      maximize yt √¢¬à¬í ys subject to for all ij, yj √¢¬à¬í yi ‚â§ wij
and feasible duals correspond to the concept of a consistent_heuristic for the
A*_algorithm for shortest paths. For any feasible dual y the reduced_costs
w  i j  &#x2032;  =  w  i j   &#x2212;  y  j   +  y  i     {\displaystyle w'_
{ij}=w_{ij}-y_{j}+y_{i}}  [w'_{ij}=w_{ij}-y_{j}+y_{i}] are nonnegative and A*
essentially runs Dijkstra's_algorithm on these reduced costs.
***** General algebraic framework on semirings: the algebraic path problem
[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (August
         2014)
Many problems can be framed as a form of the shortest path for some suitably
substituted notions of addition along a path and taking the minimum. The
general approach to these is to consider the two operations to be those of a
semiring. Semiring multiplication is done along the path, and the addition is
between paths. This general framework is known as the algebraic_path_problem.
[7][8][9]
Most of the classic shortest-path algorithms (and new ones) can be formulated
as solving linear systems over such algebraic structures.[10]
More recently, an even more general framework for solving these (and much less
obviously related problems) has been developed under the banner of valuation
algebras.[11]
***** Shortest path in stochastic time-dependent networks[edit] *****
In real-life situations, the transportation network is usually stochastic and
time-dependent. In fact, a traveler traversing a link daily may experiences
different travel times on that link due not only to the fluctuations in travel
demand (origin-destination matrix) but also due to such incidents as work
zones, bad weather conditions, accidents and vehicle breakdowns. As a result, a
stochastic time-dependent (STD) network is a more realistic representation of
an actual road network compared with the deterministic one.[12][13]
Despite considerable progress during the course of the past decade, it remains
a controversial question how an optimal path should be defined and identified
in stochastic road networks. In other words, there is no unique definition of
an optimal path under uncertainty. One possible and common answer to this
question is to find a path with the minimum expected travel time. The main
advantage of using this approach is that efficient shortest path algorithms
introduced for the deterministic networks can be readily employed to identify
the path with the minimum expected travel time in a stochastic network.
However, the resulting optimal path identified by this approach may not be
reliable, because this approach fails to address travel time variability. To
tackle this issue some researchers use distribution of travel time instead of
expected value of it so they find the probability distribution of total
travelling time using different optimization methods such as dynamic
programming and Dijkstra's_algorithm .[14] These methods use stochastic
optimization, specifically stochastic dynamic programming to find the shortest
path in networks with probabilistic arc length.[15] The concept of travel time
reliability is used interchangeably with travel time variability in the
transportation research literature, so that, in general, one can say that the
higher the variability in travel time, the lower the reliability would be, and
vice versa.
In order to account for travel time reliability more accurately, two common
alternative definitions for an optimal path under uncertainty have been
suggested. Some have introduced the concept of the most reliable path, aiming
to maximize the probability of arriving on time or earlier than a given travel
time budget. Others, alternatively, have put forward the concept of an √é¬±-
reliable path based on which they intended to minimize the travel time budget
required to ensure a pre-specified on-time arrival probability.
