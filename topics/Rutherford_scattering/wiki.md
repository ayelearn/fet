****** Rutherford scattering ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Rutherford scattering is the elastic_scattering of charged particles by the
Coulomb_interaction. It is a physical phenomenon explained by Ernest_Rutherford
in 1911[1] that led to the development of the planetary Rutherford_model of the
atom and eventually the Bohr_model. Rutherford scattering was first referred to
as Coulomb scattering because it relies only upon the static_electric (Coulomb)
potential, and the minimum distance between particles is set entirely by this
potential. The classical Rutherford scattering process of alpha_particles
against gold nuclei is an example of "elastic_scattering" because neither the
alpha particles nor the gold nuclei are internally excited. The Rutherford
formula (see below) further neglects the recoil kinetic_energy of the massive
target nucleus.
The initial discovery was made by Hans_Geiger and Ernest_Marsden in 1909 when
they performed the gold_foil_experiment in collaboration with Rutherford, in
which they fired a beam of alpha particles (helium nuclei) at foils of gold
leaf only a few atoms thick. At the time of the experiment, the atom was
thought to be analogous_to_a_plum_pudding (as proposed by J._J._Thomson), with
the negatively-charged electrons (the plums) studded throughout a positive
spherical matrix (the pudding). If the plum-pudding model were correct, the
positive "pudding", being more spread out than in the correct model of a
concentrated nucleus, would not be able to exert such large coulombic forces,
and the alpha particles should only be deflected by small angles as they pass
through.
Figure 1. In a cloud_chamber, a 5.3 MeV alpha particle track from a lead-210
pin source near point 1 undergoes Rutherford scattering near point 2,
deflecting by an angle of about 30Â°. It scatters once again near point 3, and
finally comes to rest in the gas. The target nucleus in the chamber gas could
have been a nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, or hydrogen nucleus. It received enough
kinetic_energy in the elastic_collision to cause a short visible recoiling
track near point 2. (The scale is in centimeters.)
However, the intriguing results showed that around 1 in 8000 alpha particles
were deflected by very large angles (over 90Â°), while the rest passed through
with little deflection. From this, Rutherford concluded that the majority of
the mass was concentrated in a minute, positively-charged region (the nucleus)
surrounded by electrons. When a (positive) alpha particle approached
sufficiently close to the nucleus, it was repelled strongly enough to rebound
at high angles. The small size of the nucleus explained the small number of
alpha particles that were repelled in this way. Rutherford showed, using the
method outlined below, that the size of the nucleus was less than about
10â14 m (how much less than this size, Rutherford could not tell from this
experiment alone; see more below on this problem of lowest possible size). As a
visual example, Figure 1 shows the deflection of an alpha particle by a nucleus
in the gas of a cloud_chamber.
Rutherford scattering is now exploited by the materials science community in an
analytical_technique called Rutherford_backscattering.

***** Derivation[edit] *****
The differential_cross_section can be derived from the equations of motion for
a particle interacting with a central_potential. In general, the equations of
motion describing two_particles interacting under a central_force can be
decoupled into the center of mass and the motion of the particles relative to
one another. For the case of light alpha particles scattering off heavy nuclei,
as in the experiment performed by Rutherford, the reduced_mass is essentially
the mass of the alpha particle and the nucleus off of which it scatters is
essentially stationary in the lab frame.
Substituting into the Binet_equation, with the origin of coordinate system
( r , &#x03B8; )   {\displaystyle (r,\theta )}  [{\displaystyle (r,\theta )}]
on the target (scatterer), yields the equation of trajectory as
             d  2   u   d  &#x03B8;  2      + u = &#x2212;     Z  1    Z  2
      e  2     4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;  0   m  v  0   2    b  2      = &#x2212;
      &#x03BA; ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}u}{d\theta ^{2}}}+u=-{\frac {Z_
      {1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}mv_{0}^{2}b^{2}}}=-\kappa ,}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}u}{d\theta ^{2}}}+u=-{\frac {Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}
      {4\pi \epsilon _{0}mv_{0}^{2}b^{2}}}=-\kappa ,}]
where u = 1/r, v0 is the speed at infinity, and b is the impact_parameter.
The general solution of the above differential equation is
         u =  u  0   cos &#x2061;  (  &#x03B8; &#x2212;  &#x03B8;  0    )
      &#x2212; &#x03BA; ,   {\displaystyle u=u_{0}\cos \left(\theta -\theta _
      {0}\right)-\kappa ,}  [{\displaystyle u=u_{0}\cos \left(\theta -\theta _
      {0}\right)-\kappa ,}]
and the boundary condition is
         u &#x2192; 0   and   r sin &#x2061; &#x03B8; &#x2192; b  ( &#x03B8;
      &#x2192; &#x03C0; ) .   {\displaystyle u\to 0\quad {\text{and}}\quad
      r\sin \theta \to b\quad (\theta \to \pi ).}  [{\displaystyle u\to 0\quad
      {\text{and}}\quad r\sin \theta \to b\quad (\theta \to \pi ).}]
Solving the equations u â 0 and its derivative du/dÎ¸ â â1/b using those
boundary conditions, we can obtain
          &#x03B8;  0   =   &#x03C0; 2   + arctan &#x2061; b &#x03BA; .
      {\displaystyle \theta _{0}={\frac {\pi }{2}}+\arctan b\kappa .}  [
      {\displaystyle \theta _{0}={\frac {\pi }{2}}+\arctan b\kappa .}]
Then the deflection_angle Î is
             &#x0398;    = 2  &#x03B8;  0   &#x2212; &#x03C0; = 2 arctan
      &#x2061; b &#x03BA;       = 2 arctan &#x2061;     Z  1    Z  2    e  2
      4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;  0   m  v  0   2   b    .       {\displaystyle
      {\begin{aligned}\Theta &=2\theta _{0}-\pi =2\arctan b\kappa \\&=2\arctan
      {\frac {Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}mv_{0}^{2}b}}.\end{aligned}}}
      [{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Theta &=2\theta _{0}-\pi =2\arctan
      b\kappa \\&=2\arctan {\frac {Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}mv_{0}^
      {2}b}}.\end{aligned}}}]
b can be solved to give
         b =     Z  1    Z  2    e  2     4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;  0   m  v  0   2
      cot &#x2061;   &#x0398; 2   .   {\displaystyle b={\frac {Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}
      {4\pi \epsilon _{0}mv_{0}^{2}}}\cot {\frac {\Theta }{2}}.}  [
      {\displaystyle b={\frac {Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}mv_{0}^
      {2}}}\cot {\frac {\Theta }{2}}.}]
To find the scattering cross section from this result consider its definition
            d &#x03C3;   d &#x03A9;    ( &#x03A9; ) d &#x03A9; =      number of
      particles scattered into solid angle&#xA0;   d &#x03A9;   &#xA0;per unit
      time     incident intensity      {\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma }{d\Omega
      }}(\Omega )d\Omega ={\frac {{\hbox{number of particles scattered into
      solid angle }}d\Omega {\hbox{ per unit time}}}{\hbox{incident
      intensity}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma }{d\Omega }}(\Omega
      )d\Omega ={\frac {{\hbox{number of particles scattered into solid angle
      }}d\Omega {\hbox{ per unit time}}}{\hbox{incident intensity}}}}]
Since the scattering angle is uniquely determined for a given E and b, the
number of particles scattered into an angle between Î and Î + dÎ must be the
same as the number of particles with associated impact parameters between b and
b + db. For an incident intensity I, this implies the following equality
         2 &#x03C0; I b  |  d b  |  = I    d &#x03C3;   d &#x03A9;    d
      &#x03A9;   {\displaystyle 2\pi Ib\left|db\right|=I{\frac {d\sigma }
      {d\Omega }}d\Omega }  [2\pi I b \left|db\right| = I \frac{d\sigma}
      {d\Omega} d\Omega ]
For a radially symmetric scattering potential, as in the case of the Coulomb
potential, dÎ© = 2Ï sin Î dÎ, yielding the expression for the scattering
cross section
            d &#x03C3;   d &#x03A9;    =   b  sin &#x2061;  &#x0398;      |
      d b   d &#x0398;    |    {\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma }{d\Omega }}=
      {\frac {b}{\sin {\Theta }}}\left|{\frac {db}{d\Theta }}\right|}  [ \frac
      {d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{b}{\sin{\Theta}} \left|\frac{db}
      {d\Theta}\right| ]
Plugging in the previously derived expression for the impact parameter b(Î) we
find the Rutherford differential scattering cross section
            d &#x03C3;   d &#x03A9;    =   (     Z  1    Z  2    e  2     8
      &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;  0   m  v  0   2      )   2    csc  4   &#x2061;
      &#x0398; 2   .   {\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma }{d\Omega }}=\left({\frac
      {Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{8\pi \epsilon _{0}mv_{0}^{2}}}\right)^{2}\csc ^{4}
      {\frac {\Theta }{2}}.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma }{d\Omega
      }}=\left({\frac {Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{8\pi \epsilon _{0}mv_{0}^{2}}}\right)^
      {2}\csc ^{4}{\frac {\Theta }{2}}.}]
This same result can be expressed alternatively as
            d &#x03C3;   d &#x03A9;    =   (     Z  1    Z  2   &#x03B1;
      ( &#x210F; c )   4  E   K     sin  2   &#x2061;   &#x0398; 2      )   2
      ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma }{d\Omega }}=\left({\frac {Z_{1}Z_
      {2}\alpha (\hbar c)}{4E_{\mathrm {K} }\sin ^{2}{\frac {\Theta }
      {2}}}}\right)^{2},}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma }{d\Omega }}=\left(
      {\frac {Z_{1}Z_{2}\alpha (\hbar c)}{4E_{\mathrm {K} }\sin ^{2}{\frac
      {\Theta }{2}}}}\right)^{2},}]
where Î± â 1/137 is the dimensionless fine_structure_constant, EK is the non-
relativistic kinetic energy of the particle in MeV, and Ä§c â 197 MeVÂ·fm.
***** Details of calculating maximal nuclear size[edit] *****
For head-on collisions between alpha particles and the nucleus (with zero
impact parameter), all the kinetic_energy of the alpha particle is turned into
potential_energy and the particle is at rest. The distance from the center of
the alpha particle to the center of the nucleus (rmin) at this point is an
upper limit for the nuclear radius, if it is evident from the experiment that
the scattering process obeys the cross section formula given above.
Applying the inverse-square_law between the charges on the alpha particle and
nucleus, one can write:
           1 2   m  v  2   =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;  0      &#x22C5;     q
      1    q  2     r  min       {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}={\frac {1}
      {4\pi \epsilon _{0}}}\cdot {\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{\text{min}}}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}={\frac {1}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}}}\cdot
      {\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{\text{min}}}}}]
Rearranging:
          r  min   =   1  4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;  0      &#x22C5;    2  q  1    q
      2     m  v  2        {\displaystyle r_{\text{min}}={\frac {1}{4\pi
      \epsilon _{0}}}\cdot {\frac {2q_{1}q_{2}}{mv^{2}}}}  [{\displaystyle r_
      {\text{min}}={\frac {1}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}}}\cdot {\frac {2q_{1}q_{2}}
      {mv^{2}}}}]
For an alpha particle:
    * m (mass) = 6.64424Ã10â27 kg = 3.7273Ã109 eV/c2
    * q1 (for helium) = 2 Ã 1.6Ã10â19 C = 3.2Ã10â19 C
    * q2 (for gold) = 79 Ã 1.6Ã10â19 C = 1.27Ã10â17 C
    * v (initial velocity) = 2Ã107 m/s (for this example)
Substituting these in gives the value of about 2.7Ã10â14 m, or 27 fm. (The
true radius is about 7.3 fm.) The true radius of the nucleus is not recovered
in these experiments because the alphas do not have enough energy to penetrate
to more than 27 fm of the nuclear center, as noted, when the actual radius of
gold is 7.3 fm. Rutherford realized this, and also realized that actual impact
of the alphas on gold causing any force-deviation from that of the 1/r coulomb
potential would change the form of his scattering curve at high scattering
angles (the smallest impact_parameters) from a hyperbola to something else.
This was not seen, indicating that the surface of the gold nucleus had not been
"touched" so that Rutherford also knew the gold nucleus (or the sum of the gold
and alpha radii) was smaller than 27 fm.
***** Extension to situations with relativistic particles and target recoil
[edit] *****
The extension of low-energy Rutherford-type scattering to relativistic energies
and particles that have intrinsic spin is beyond the scope of this article. For
example, electron scattering from the proton is described as Mott_scattering,
[2] with a cross section that reduces to the Rutherford formula for non-
relativistic electrons. If no internal energy excitation of the beam or target
particle occurs, the process is called "elastic scattering", since energy and
momentum have to be conserved in any case. If the collision causes one or the
other of the constituents to become excited, or if new particles are created in
the interaction, then the process is said to be "inelastic scattering".
