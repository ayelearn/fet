Dehydration
[Cholera_rehydration_nurses.jpg]
Nurses encourage a patient to drink an oral rehydration solution to reduce the
combination of dehydration and hypovolemia he acquired from cholera. Cholera
leads to GI loss of both excess free water (dehydration) and sodium (hence ECF
volume depletionâhypovolemia).
Specialty Critical_care_medicine
In physiology, dehydration is a deficit of total body_water,[1] with an
accompanying disruption of metabolic_processes. It occurs when free water loss
exceeds free water intake, usually due to exercise, disease, or high
environmental temperature. Mild dehydration can also be caused by immersion
diuresis, which may increase risk of decompression_sickness in divers.
Most people can tolerate a three to four percent decrease in total body water
without difficulty or adverse health effects. A five to eight percent decrease
can cause fatigue and dizziness. Loss of over ten percent of total body water
can cause physical and mental deterioration, accompanied by severe thirst.
Death occurs at a loss of between fifteen and twenty-five percent of the body
water.[2] Mild dehydration is characterized by thirst and general discomfort
and is usually resolved with oral_rehydration.
Dehydration can cause hypernatremia (high levels of sodium_ions in the blood)
and is distinct from hypovolemia (loss of blood_volume, particularly blood
plasma).

***** Signs and symptoms[edit] *****

Ultrasound of the blood vessels of the neck that supports the diagnosis of
severe dehydration[3]
The hallmarks of dehydration include thirst and neurological changes such as
headaches, general_discomfort, loss of appetite, decreased urine volume (unless
polyuria is the cause of dehydration), confusion, unexplained tiredness, purple
fingernails and seizures. The symptoms of dehydration become increasingly
severe with greater total body water loss. A body water loss of 1-2%,
considered mild dehydration, is shown to impair cognitive performance.[4] In
people over age 50, the body's thirst sensation diminishes and continues
diminishing with age. Many senior citizens suffer symptoms of dehydration.
Dehydration contributes to morbidity in the elderly especially during
conditions that promote insensible free water losses such as hot weather. A
Cochrane review on this subject defined water-loss dehydration as "people with
serum osmolality of 295 mOsm/kg or more" and found that the main symptoms in
the elderly were expressing fatigue, missing drinks between meals and
bioelectrical impedance analysis.[5]
***** Cause[edit] *****
Risk factors for dehydration include but are not limited to: exerting oneself
in hot and humid weather, habitation at high altitudes, endurance athletics,
elderly adults, infants, children and people living with chronic illnesses.[6]
Dehydration can also come as a side effect from many different types of drugs
and medications.[7]
In the elderly, blunted response to thirst and/or inadequate ability to access
free water in the face of excess free water losses (especially hyperglycemia
related) seem to be the main causes of dehydration.[8] Excess free water or
hypotonic water can leave the body in two ways - sensible loss such as osmotic
diuresis, sweating, vomiting and diarrhea, and insensible water loss, occurring
mainly through the skin and respiratory_tract. In humans, dehydration can be
caused by a wide range of diseases and states that impair water homeostasis in
the body. These occur primarily through either impaired thirst/water access or
sodium excess.[9]
***** Diagnosis[edit] *****
**** Definition[edit] ****
Dehydration occurs when water intake is not enough to replace free_water lost
due to normal physiologic processes, including breathing, urination, and
perspiration, or other causes, including diarrhea and vomiting. Dehydration can
be life-threatening when severe and lead to seizures or respiratory arrest, and
also carries the risk of osmotic_cerebral_edema if rehydration is overly rapid.
[10]
The term dehydration has sometimes been used incorrectly as a proxy for the
separate, related condition hypovolemia, which specifically refers to a
decrease in volume of blood_plasma.[1] The two are regulated through
independent mechanisms in humans;[1] the distinction is important in guiding
treatment.[11]
***** Prevention[edit] *****
For routine activities, thirst is normally an adequate guide to maintain proper
hydration.[12] Minimum water intake will vary individually depending on weight,
environment, diet and genetics.[13] With exercise, exposure to hot
environments, or a decreased thirst response, additional water may be required.
In athletes in competition drinking to thirst optimizes performance and safety,
despite weight loss, and as of 2010, there was no scientific study showing that
it is beneficial to stay ahead of thirst and maintain weight during exercise.
[14]
In warm or humid weather or during heavy exertion, water loss can increase
markedly, because humans have a large and widely variable capacity for the
active secretion of sweat. Whole-body sweat losses in men can exceed 2 L/
h during competitive_sport, with rates of 3â4 L/h observed during short-
duration, high-intensity exercise in the heat.[15] When such large amounts of
water are being lost through perspiration, electrolytes, especially sodium, are
also being lost.
In most athletes, exercising and sweating for 4â5 hours with a sweat sodium
concentration of less than 50 mmol/L, the total sodium lost is less than 10% of
total body stores (total stores are approximately 2,500 mmol, or 58 g for a 70-
kg person).[16] These losses appear to be well tolerated by most people. The
inclusion of some sodium in fluid replacement drinks has some theoretical
benefits[16] and poses little or no risk, so long as these fluids are hypotonic
(since the mainstay of dehydration prevention is the replacement of free water
losses).
The consumption of overly sugary and/or salty foods can cause dehydration.[17]
***** Treatment[edit] *****
Main article: Management_of_dehydration
The treatment for minor dehydration that is often considered the most effective
is drinking water and stopping fluid loss. Plain water restores only the volume
of the blood plasma, inhibiting the thirst mechanism before solute levels can
be replenished.[18] Solid foods can contribute to fluid loss from vomiting and
diarrhea.[19] Urine concentration and frequency will customarily return to
normal as dehydration resolves.[20]
In some cases, correction of a dehydrated state is accomplished by the
replenishment of necessary water and electrolytes (through oral_rehydration
therapy or fluid_replacement by intravenous_therapy). As oral rehydration is
less painful, less invasive, less expensive, and easier to provide, it is the
treatment of choice for mild dehydration.[citation_needed] Solutions used for
intravenous rehydration must be isotonic or hypertonic.[citation_needed] Pure
water injected into the veins will cause the breakdown (lysis) of red blood
cells (erythrocytes).[citation_needed]
When fresh_water is unavailable (e.g. at sea or in a desert), seawater and
ethanol will worsen the condition. Urine contains a lower solute concentration
than seawater, and numerous guides advise against its consumption in survival
situations.[21] If somebody is dehydrated and is taken to a hospital, IVs are
also used.[22][23][24][25]
For severe cases of dehydration where fainting, unconsciousness, or other
severely inhibiting symptom is present (the patient is incapable of standing or
thinking clearly), emergency attention is required. Fluids containing a proper
balance of replacement electrolytes are given orally or intravenously with
continuing assessment of electrolyte status; complete resolution is the norm in
all but the most extreme cases.[26]
