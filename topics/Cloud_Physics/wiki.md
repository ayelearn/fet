Cloud physics is the study of the physical processes that lead to the
formation, growth and precipitation of atmospheric clouds. These aerosols are
found in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, which collectively make
up the greatest part of the homosphere. Clouds consist of microscopic droplets
of liquid water (warm clouds), tiny crystals of ice (cold clouds), or both
(mixed phase clouds). Cloud droplets initially form by the condensation of
water vapor onto condensation nuclei when the supersaturation of air exceeds a
critical value according to KÃ¶hler_theory. Cloud_condensation_nuclei are
necessary for cloud droplets formation because of the Kelvin_effect, which
describes the change in saturation vapor pressure due to a curved surface. At
small radii, the amount of supersaturation needed for condensation to occur is
so large, that it does not happen naturally. Raoult's_law describes how the
vapor pressure is dependent on the amount of solute in a solution. At high
concentrations, when the cloud droplets are small, the supersaturation required
is smaller than without the presence of a nucleus.
In warm clouds, larger cloud droplets fall at a higher terminal velocity;
because at a given velocity, the drag force per unit of droplet weight on
smaller droplets is larger than on large droplets. The large droplets can then
collide with small droplets and combine to form even larger drops. When the
drops become large enough that their downward velocity (relative to the
surrounding air) is greater than the upward velocity (relative to the ground)
of the surrounding air, the drops can fall as precipitation. The collision and
coalescence is not as important in mixed phase clouds where the Bergeron
process dominates. Other important processes that form precipitation are
riming, when a supercooled liquid drop collides with a solid snowflake, and
aggregation, when two solid snowflakes collide and combine. The precise
mechanics of how a cloud forms and grows is not completely understood, but
scientists have developed theories explaining the structure of clouds by
studying the microphysics of individual droplets. Advances in weather_radar and
satellite technology have also allowed the precise study of clouds on a large
scale.

***** History of cloud physics[edit] *****
The modern cloud physics began in the 19th century and was described in several
publications.[1][2][3] Otto_von_Guericke originated the idea that clouds were
composed of water bubbles. In 1847 Augustus_Waller used spider_web to examine
droplets under the microscope.[4] These observations were confirmed by William
Henry_Dines in 1880 and Richard_Assmann in 1884.
***** Cloud formation: how the air becomes saturated[edit] *****
**** Cooling air to its dew point[edit] ****

*** Adiabatic cooling: rising packets of moist air[edit] ***
See also: Adiabatic_process
As water evaporates from an area of Earth's surface, the air over that area
becomes moist. Moist air is lighter than the surrounding dry air, creating an
unstable situation. When enough moist air has accumulated, all the moist air
rises as a single packet, without mixing with the surrounding air. As more
moist air forms along the surface, the process repeats, resulting in a series
of discrete packets of moist air rising to form clouds.[5]
This process occurs when one or more of three possible lifting
agentsâcyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographicâcauses air containing
invisible water_vapor to rise and cool to its dew_point, the temperature at
which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is
adiabatic_cooling.[6] Atmospheric_pressure decreases with altitude, so the
rising air expands in a process that expends energy and causes the air to cool,
which makes water vapor condense into cloud.[7] Water vapor in saturated air is
normally attracted to condensation_nuclei such as dust and salt particles that
are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air. The water
droplets in a cloud have a normal radius of about 0.002 mm (0.00008 in). The
droplets may collide to form larger droplets, which remain aloft as long as the
velocity of the rising air within the cloud is equal to or greater than the
terminal velocity of the droplets.[8]
For non-convective cloud, the altitude at which condensation begins to happen
is called the lifted_condensation_level (LCL), which roughly determines the
height of the cloud base. Free convective clouds generally form at the altitude
of the convective_condensation_level (CCL). Water vapor in saturated air is
normally attracted to condensation_nuclei such as salt particles that are small
enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air. If the condensation
process occurs below the freezing_level in the troposphere, the nuclei help
transform the vapor into very small water droplets. Clouds that form just above
the freezing level are composed mostly of supercooled liquid droplets, while
those that condense out at higher altitudes where the air is much colder
generally take the form of ice_crystals. An absence of sufficient condensation
particles at and above the condensation level causes the rising air to become
supersaturated and the formation of cloud tends to be inhibited.[9]
** Frontal and cyclonic lift[edit] **
See also: Extratropical_cyclone, Warm_front, Cold_front, and Precipitation
Frontal and cyclonic lift occur in their purest manifestations when stable air,
which has been subjected to little or no surface heating, is forced aloft at
weather_fronts and around centers of low_pressure.[10] Warm_fronts associated
with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform
clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in
which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in
the main precipitating cloud layer.[11] Cold_fronts are usually faster moving
and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform,
cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass
just ahead of the front.[12]
** Convective lift[edit] **
See also: Atmospheric_convection
Another agent is the buoyant convective upward motion caused by significant
daytime solar heating at surface level, or by relatively high absolute
humidity.[9] Incoming short-wave radiation generated by the sun is re-emitted
as long-wave radiation when it reaches Earth's surface. This process warms the
air closest to ground and increases air mass instability by creating a steeper
temperature gradient from warm or hot at surface level to cold aloft. This
causes it to rise and cool until temperature equilibrium is achieved with the
surrounding air aloft. Moderate instability allows for the formation of
cumuliform clouds of moderate size that can produce light showers if the
airmass is sufficiently moist. Typical convection upcurrents may allow the
droplets to grow to a radius of about 0.015 millimetres (0.0006 in) before
precipitating as showers.[13] The equivalent diameter of these droplets is
about 0.03 millimetres (0.001 in).
If air near the surface becomes extremely warm and unstable, its upward motion
can become quite explosive, resulting in towering cumulonimbiform clouds that
can cause severe_weather. As tiny water particles that make up the cloud group
together to form droplets of rain, they are pulled down to earth by the force
of gravity. The droplets would normally evaporate below the condensation level,
but strong updrafts buffer the falling droplets, and can keep them aloft much
longer than they would otherwise. Violent updrafts can reach speeds of up to
180 miles per hour (290 km/h).[14] The longer the rain droplets remain aloft,
the more time they have to grow into larger droplets that eventually fall as
heavy showers.
Rain droplets that are carried well above the freezing level become supercooled
at first then freeze into small hail. A frozen ice nucleus can pick up 0.5
inches (1.3 cm) in size traveling through one of these updrafts and can cycle
through several updrafts and downdrafts before finally becoming so heavy that
it falls to the ground as large hail. Cutting a hailstone in half shows onion-
like layers of ice, indicating distinct times when it passed through a layer of
super-cooled water. Hailstones have been found with diameters of up to 7 inches
(18 cm).[15]
Convective lift can occur in an unstable air mass well away from any fronts.
However, very warm unstable air can also be present around fronts and low-
pressure centers, often producing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds in
heavier and more active concentrations because of the combined frontal and
convective lifting agents. As with non-frontal convective lift, increasing
instability promotes upward vertical cloud growth and raises the potential for
severe weather. On comparatively rare occasions, convective lift can be
powerful enough to penetrate the tropopause and push the cloud top into the
stratosphere.[16]
** Orographic lift[edit] **
Main article: Orographic_lift
A third source of lift is wind circulation forcing air over a physical barrier
such as a mountain (orographic_lift).[9] If the air is generally stable,
nothing more than lenticular cap clouds will form. However, if the air becomes
sufficiently moist and unstable, orographic showers or thunderstorms may
appear.[17]
Windy evening twilight enhanced by the Sun's angle, can visually mimic a
tornado resulting from orographic lift
*** Non-adiabatic cooling[edit] ***
Along with adiabatic cooling that requires a lifting agent, there are three
other main mechanisms for lowering the temperature of the air to its dew point,
all of which occur near surface level and do not require any lifting of the
air. Conductive, radiational, and evaporative cooling can cause condensation at
surface level resulting in the formation of fog.[18] Conductive cooling takes
place when air from a relatively mild source area comes into contact with a
colder surface, as when mild marine air moves across a colder land area.
Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared_radiation, either by
the air or by the surface underneath.[19] This type of cooling is common during
the night when the sky is clear. Evaporative cooling happens when moisture is
added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool
to its wet-bulb_temperature, or sometimes to the point of saturation.[20]
**** Adding moisture to the air[edit] ****
There are five main ways water vapor can be added to the air. Increased vapor
content can result from wind convergence over water or moist ground into areas
of upward motion.[21] Precipitation or virga falling from above also enhances
moisture content.[22] Daytime heating causes water to evaporate from the
surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land.[23] Transpiration from plants is
another typical source of water vapor.[24] Lastly, cool or dry air moving over
warmer water will become more humid. As with daytime heating, the addition of
moisture to the air increases its heat content and instability and helps set
into motion those processes that lead to the formation of cloud or fog.[25]
**** Supersaturation[edit] ****
The amount of water that can exist as vapor in a given volume increases with
the temperature. When the amount of water vapor is in equilibrium above a flat
surface of water the level of vapor_pressure is called saturation and the
relative_humidity is 100%. At this equilibrium there are equal numbers of
molecules evaporating from the water as there are condensing back into the
water. If the relative humidity becomes greater than 100%, it is called
supersaturated. Supersaturation occurs in the absence of condensation nuclei.
[citation_needed]
Since the saturation vapor pressure is proportional to temperature, cold air
has a lower saturation point than warm air. The difference between these values
is the basis for the formation of clouds. When saturated air cools, it can no
longer contain the same amount of water vapor. If the conditions are right, the
excess water will condense out of the air until the lower saturation point is
reached. Another possibility is that the water stays in vapor form, even though
it is beyond the saturation point, resulting in supersaturation.[citation
needed]
Supersaturation of more than 1â2% relative to water is rarely seen in the
atmosphere, since cloud condensation nuclei are usually present.[26] Much
higher degrees of supersaturation are possible in clean air, and are the basis
of the cloud_chamber.
There are no instruments to take measurements of supersaturation in clouds.[27]
**** Supercooling[edit] ****
Water droplets commonly remain as liquid water and do not freeze, even well
below 0 Â°C (32 Â°F). Ice nuclei that may be present in an atmospheric droplet
become active for ice formation at specific temperatures in between 0 Â°C
(32 Â°F) and â38 Â°C (â36 Â°F), depending on nucleus geometry and
composition. Without ice nuclei, supercooled_water droplets (as well as any
extremely pure liquid water) can exist down to about â38 Â°C (â36 Â°F), at
which point spontaneous freezing occurs.[citation_needed]
**** Collision-coalescence[edit] ****
Main article: Coalescence_(meteorology)
One theory explaining how the behavior of individual droplets in a cloud leads
to the formation of precipitation is the collision-coalescence process.
Droplets suspended in the air will interact with each other, either by
colliding and bouncing off each other or by combining to form a larger droplet.
Eventually, the droplets become large enough that they fall to the earth as
precipitation. The collision-coalescence process does not make up a significant
part of cloud formation, as water droplets have a relatively high surface
tension. In addition, the occurrence of collision-coalescence is closely
related to entrainment-mixing processes.[28]
**** Bergeron process[edit] ****
Main article: Bergeron_process
The primary mechanism for the formation of ice clouds was discovered by Tor
Bergeron. The Bergeron process notes that the saturation_vapor_pressure of
water, or how much water vapor a given volume can contain, depends on what the
vapor is interacting with. Specifically, the saturation vapor pressure with
respect to ice is lower than the saturation vapor pressure with respect to
water. Water vapor interacting with a water droplet may be saturated, at 100%
relative_humidity, when interacting with a water droplet, but the same amount
of water vapor would be supersaturated when interacting with an ice particle.
[29] The water vapor will attempt to return to equilibrium, so the extra water
vapor will condense into ice on the surface of the particle. These ice
particles end up as the nuclei of larger ice crystals. This process only
happens at temperatures between 0 Â°C (32 Â°F) and â40 Â°C (â40 Â°F). Below
â40 Â°C (â40 Â°F), liquid water will spontaneously nucleate, and freeze.
The surface tension of the water allows the droplet to stay liquid well below
its normal freezing point. When this happens, it is now supercooled_liquid
water. The Bergeron process relies on super cooled liquid water (SLW)
interacting with ice_nuclei to form larger particles. If there are few ice
nuclei compared to the amount of SLW, droplets will be unable to form. A
process whereby scientists seed a cloud with artificial ice nuclei to encourage
precipitation is known as cloud seeding. This can help cause precipitation in
clouds that otherwise may not rain. Cloud_seeding adds excess artificial ice
nuclei which shifts the balance so that there are many nuclei compared to the
amount of super cooled liquid water. An over seeded cloud will form many
particles, but each will be very small. This can be done as a preventative
measure for areas that are at risk for hail storms.[citation_needed]
***** Cloud classification[edit] *****
Main article: List_of_cloud_types
Clouds in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth, are
classified according to the height at which they are found, and their shape or
appearance.[30] There are five forms based on physical structure and process of
formation.[31] Cirriform clouds are high, thin and wispy, and are seen most
extensively along the leading edges of organized weather disturbances.
Stratiform clouds are non-convective and appear as extensive sheet-like layers,
ranging from thin to very thick with considerable vertical development. They
are mostly the product of large-scale lifting of stable air. Unstable free-
convective cumuliform clouds are formed mostly into localized heaps.
Stratocumuliform clouds of limited convection show a mix of cumuliform and
stratiform characteristics which appear in the form of rolls or ripples. Highly
convective cumulonimbiform clouds have complex structures often including
cirriform tops and stratocumuliform accessory clouds.[citation_needed]
These forms are cross-classified by altitude range or level into ten genus
types which can be subdivided into species and lesser types. High-level clouds
form at altitudes of 5 to 12 kilometers. All cirriform clouds are classified as
high-level and therefore constitute a single cloud genus cirrus. Stratiform and
stratocumuliform clouds in the high level of the troposphere have the prefix
cirro- added to their names yielding the genera cirrostratus and cirrocumulus.
Similar clouds found in the middle level (altitude range 2 to 7 kilometers)
carry the prefix alto- resulting in the genus names altostratus and
altocumulus.[32]
Low level clouds have no height-related prefixes, so stratiform and
stratocumuliform clouds based around 2 kilometres or lower are known simply as
stratus and stratocumulus. Small cumulus clouds with little vertical
development (species humilis) are also commonly classified as low level.[32]
Cumuliform and cumulonimbiform heaps and deep stratiform layers often occupy at
least two tropospheric levels, and the largest or deepest of these can occupy
all three levels. They may be classified as low or mid-level, but are also
commonly classified or characterized as vertical or multi-level. Nimbostratus
clouds are stratiform layers with sufficient vertical extent to produce
significant precipitation. Towering cumulus (species congestus), and
cumulonimbus may form anywhere from near the surface to intermediate heights of
around 3 kilometres. Of the vertically developed clouds, the cumulonimbus type
is the tallest and can virtually span the entire troposphere from a few hundred
metres above the ground up to the tropopause.[32] It is the cloud responsible
for thunderstorms.
Some clouds can form at very high to extreme levels above the troposphere,
mostly above the polar regions of Earth. Polar_stratospheric_clouds clouds are
seen but rarely in winter at altitudes of 18 to 30 kilometers, while in summer,
noctilucent clouds occasionally form at high latitudes at an altitude range of
76 to 85 kilometers.[33] These polar clouds show some of the same forms as seen
lower in the troposphere.

***** Determination of properties[edit] *****
Satellites are used to gather data about cloud properties and other information
such as Cloud Amount, height, IR emissivity, visible optical depth, icing,
effective particle size for both liquid and ice, and cloud top temperature and
pressure.
**** Detection[edit] ****
Data sets regarding cloud properties are gathered using satellites, such as
MODIS, POLDER, CALIPSO or ATSR. The instruments measure the radiances of the
clouds, from which the relevant parameters can be retrieved. This is usually
done by using inverse_theory.[34]
The method of detection is based on the fact that the clouds tend to appear
brighter and colder than the land surface. Because of this, difficulties rise
in detecting clouds above bright (highly reflective) surfaces, such as oceans
and ice.[34]
**** Parameters[edit] ****
The value of a certain parameter is more reliable the more satellites are
measuring the said parameter. This is because the range of errors and neglected
details varies from instrument to instrument. Thus, if the analysed parameter
has similar values for different instruments, it is accepted that the true
value lies in the range given by the corresponding data sets.[34]
The Global_Energy_and_Water_Cycle_Experiment uses the following quantities in
order to compare data quality from different satellites in order to establish a
reliable quantification of the properties of the clouds:[34]
    * the cloud_cover or cloud amount with values between 0 and 1
    * the cloud temperature at cloud_top ranging from 150 to 340 K
    * the cloud pressure at top 1013 - 100 hPa
    * the cloud height, measured above sea level, ranging from 0 to 20 km
    * the cloud IR emissivity, with values between 0 and 1, with a global
      average around 0.7
    * the effective cloud amount, the cloud amount weighted by the cloud IR
      emissivity, with a global average of 0.5
    * the cloud (visible) optical_depth varies within a range of 4 and 10.
    * the cloud water path for the liquid and solid (ice) phases of the cloud
      particles
    * the cloud effective particle size for both liquid and ice, ranging from 0
      to 200 Î¼m
**** Icing[edit] ****
Another vital property is the icing characteristic of various cloud genus types
at various altitudes, which can have great impact on the safety of flying. The
methodologies used to determine these characteristics include using CloudSat
data for the analysis and retrieval of icing conditions, the location of clouds
using cloud geometric and reflectivity data, the identification of cloud types
using cloud classification data, and finding vertical temperature distribution
along the CloudSat track (GFS).[35]
The range of temperatures that can give rise to icing conditions is defined
according to cloud types and altitude levels:
      Low-level stratocumulus and stratus can cause icing at a temperature
      range of 0 to -10 Â°C.
      For mid-level altocumulus and altostratus, the range is 0 to -20 Â°C.
      Vertical or multi-level cumulus, cumulonimbus, and nimbostatus, create
      icing at a range of 0 to -25 Â°C.
      High-level cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus generally cause no
      icing because they are made mostly of ice crystals colder than -25 Â°C.
      [35]
**** Cohesion and dissolution[edit] ****
There are forces throughout the homosphere (which includes the troposphere,
stratosphere, and mesosphere) that can impact the structural integrity of a
cloud. However, as long as the air remains saturated, the natural force of
cohesion that hold the molecules of a substance together acts to keep the cloud
from breaking up.[36][37] Dissolution of the cloud can occur when the process
of adiabatic cooling ceases and upward lift of the air is replaced by
subsidence. This leads to at least some degree of adiabatic warming of the air
which can result in the cloud droplets or crystals turning back into invisible
water vapor.[38] Stronger forces such as wind shear and downdrafts can impact a
cloud, but these are largely confined to the troposphere where nearly all the
Earth's weather takes place.[39] A typical cumulus cloud weighs about 500
metric tons, or 1.1 million pounds, the weight of 100 elephants.[40]
***** Models[edit] *****
There are two main model schemes that can represent cloud physics, the most
common is bulk microphysics models that uses mean values to describe the cloud
properties (e.g. rain water content, ice content), the properties can represent
only the first order (concentration) or also the second order (mass).[41] The
second option is to use bin microphysics scheme that keep the moments (mass or
concentration) in different for different size of particles.[42] The bulk
microphysics models are much faster than the bin models but are less accurate.
