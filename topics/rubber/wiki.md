Natural rubber, also called India rubber or caoutchouc, as initially produced,
consists of polymers of the organic_compound isoprene, with minor impurities of
other organic compounds, plus water. Thailand and Indonesia are two of the
leading rubber producers. Forms of polyisoprene that are used as natural
rubbers are classified as elastomers.
Currently, rubber is harvested mainly in the form of the latex from the rubber
tree or others. The latex is a sticky, milky colloid drawn off by making
incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called
"tapping". The latex then is refined into rubber ready for commercial
processing. In major areas, latex is allowed to coagulate in the collection
cup. The coagulated lumps are collected and processed into dry forms for
marketing.
Natural rubber is used extensively in many applications and products, either
alone or in combination with other materials. In most of its useful forms, it
has a large stretch_ratio and high resilience, and is extremely waterproof.[1]

***** Varieties[edit] *****
**** Hevea brasiliensis[edit] ****
The major commercial source of natural rubber latex is the ParÃ¡ rubber tree
(Hevea_brasiliensis), a member of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. This
species is preferred because it grows well under cultivation. A properly
managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years.
**** Congo rubber[edit] ****
Congo_rubber, formerly a major source of rubber, came from vines in the genus
Landolphia (L._kirkii, L. heudelotis, and L. owariensis).[2]
**** Dandelion[edit] ****
Dandelion milk contains latex. The latex exhibits the same quality as the
natural rubber from rubber_trees. In the wild types of dandelion, latex content
is low and varies greatly. In Nazi_Germany, research projects tried to use
dandelions as a base for rubber production, but failed.[3] In 2013, by
inhibiting one key enzyme and using modern cultivation methods and optimization
techniques, scientists in the Fraunhofer_Institute_for_Molecular_Biology_and
Applied_Ecology (IME) in Germany developed a cultivar that is suitable for
commercial production of natural rubber.[4] In collaboration with Continental
Tires, IME began a pilot facility.
**** Other[edit] ****
Many other plants produce forms of latex rich in isoprene polymers, though not
all produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the ParÃ¡.[5] Some of them
require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and
most are more difficult to tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for
example gutta-percha (Palaquium_gutta)[6] and chicle from Manilkara species.
Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as
rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus_elastica), Panama rubber tree
(Castilla_elastica), various spurges (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca
species), the related Scorzonera_tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species,
including common dandelion (Taraxacum_officinale) and Russian dandelion
(Taraxacum_kok-saghyz), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic
properties, guayule (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes
applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish
it from the synthetic version.[1]
***** History[edit] *****
The first use of rubber was by the indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica. The
earliest archeological evidence of the use of natural latex from the Hevea_tree
comes from the Olmec culture, in which rubber was first used for making balls
for the Mesoamerican_ballgame. Rubber was later used by the Maya and Aztec
cultures â in addition to making balls Aztecs used rubber for other purposes
such as making containers and to make textiles waterproof by impregnating them
with the latex sap.[7][8]
The ParÃ¡ rubber tree is indigenous to South_America. Charles_Marie_de_La
Condamine is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the AcadÃ©mie
Royale_des_Sciences of France in 1736.[9] In 1751, he presented a paper by
FranÃ§ois_Fresneau to the AcadÃ©mie (published in 1755) that described many of
rubber's properties. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on
rubber.[9] In England, Joseph_Priestley, in 1770, observed that a piece of the
material was extremely good for rubbing off pencil marks on paper, hence the
name "rubber". It slowly made its way around England. In 1764 FranÃ§ois Fresnau
discovered that turpentine was a rubber solvent. Giovanni_Fabbroni is credited
with the discovery of naphtha as a rubber solvent in 1779.
South America remained the main source of latex rubber used during much of the
19th century. The rubber trade was heavily controlled by business interests but
no laws expressly prohibited the export of seeds or plants. In 1876, Henry
Wickham smuggled 70,000 ParÃ¡ rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them
to Kew_Gardens, England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then
sent to India, British_Ceylon (Sri_Lanka), Dutch_East_Indies (Indonesia),
Singapore, and British_Malaya. Malaya (now Peninsular_Malaysia) was later to
become the biggest producer of rubber.[10]
In the early 1900s, the Congo_Free_State in Africa was also a significant
source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by forced_labor. King Leopold
II's colonial state brutally enforced production quotas. Tactics to enforce the
rubber quotas included removing the hands of victims to prove they had been
killed. Soldiers often came back from raids with baskets full of chopped-off
hands. Villages that resisted were razed to encourage better compliance
locally. See Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State for more information on the
rubber trade in the Congo Free State in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Liberia
and Nigeria started production.
In India, commercial cultivation was introduced by British planters, although
the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale were initiated as
early as 1873 at the Calcutta Botanical Gardens. The first commercial Hevea
plantations were established at Thattekadu in Kerala in 1902. In later years
the plantation expanded to Karnataka, Tamil_Nadu and the Andaman_and_Nicobar
Islands of India. India today is the world's 3rd largest producer and 4th
largest consumer.[11]
In Singapore and Malaya, commercial production was heavily promoted by Sir
Henry_Nicholas_Ridley, who served as the first Scientific Director of the
Singapore_Botanic_Gardens from 1888 to 1911. He distributed rubber seeds to
many planters and developed the first technique for tapping trees for latex
without causing serious harm to the tree.[12] Because of his fervent promotion
of this crop, he is popularly remembered by the nickname "Mad Ridley".[13]
**** Pre-World War II[edit] ****
Charles_Goodyear developed vulcanization in 1839, although Mesoamericans used
stabilized rubber for balls and other objects as early as 1600 BC.[14][15]
Before World War II significant uses included door and window profiles, hoses,
belts, gaskets, matting, flooring and dampeners (antivibration mounts) for the
automotive industry. The use of rubber in car tires (initially solid rather
than pneumatic) in particular consumed a significant amount of rubber. Gloves
(medical, household and industrial) and toy balloons were large consumers of
rubber, although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex. Significant
tonnage of rubber was used as adhesives in many manufacturing industries and
products, although the two most noticeable were the paper and the carpet
industries. Rubber was commonly used to make rubber_bands and pencil erasers.
Rubber produced as a fiber, sometimes called 'elastic', had significant value
to the textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery
properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an
extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film.
Because of its low dye acceptance, feel and appearance, the rubber fiber was
either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with other yarns into
the fabric. Rubber yarns were used in foundation garments. While rubber is
still used in textile manufacturing, its low tenacity limits its use in
lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is
damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned
to neoprene (polymer of chloroprene), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as
another more commonly used elastomer fiber, spandex (also known as elastane),
because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.
***** Properties[edit] *****
Rubber latex
Rubber exhibits unique physical and chemical properties. Rubber's
stressâstrain behavior exhibits the Mullins_effect and the Payne_effect and
is often modeled as hyperelastic. Rubber strain_crystallizes.
Due to the presence of weakened allylic C-H bonds in each repeat_unit, natural
rubber is susceptible to vulcanisation as well as being sensitive to ozone
cracking.
The two main solvents for rubber are turpentine and naphtha (petroleum).
Because rubber does not dissolve easily, the material is finely divided by
shredding prior to its immersion.
An ammonia solution can be used to prevent the coagulation of raw latex.
Rubber begins to melt at approximately 180 Â°C (356 Â°F).

On a microscopic scale, relaxed rubber is a disorganized cluster of erratically
changing wrinkled chains. In stretched rubber, the chains are almost linear.
The restoring force is due to the preponderance of wrinkled conformations over
more linear ones. For the quantitative treatment see ideal_chain, for more
examples see entropic_force.
Cooling below the glass_transition_temperature permits local conformational
changes but a reordering is practically impossible because of the larger energy
barrier for the concerted movement of longer chains. "Frozen" rubber's
elasticity is low and strain results from small changes of bond lengths and
angles: this caused the Challenger_disaster, when the American Space_Shuttle's
flattened o-rings failed to relax to fill a widening gap.[16] The glass
transition is fast and reversible: the force resumes on heating.
The parallel chains of stretched rubber are susceptible to crystallization.
This takes some time because turns of twisted chains have to move out of the
way of the growing crystallites. Crystallization has occurred, for example,
when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively
large remaining volume. Where it is touched, it shrinks because the temperature
of the hand is enough to melt the crystals.
Vulcanization of rubber creates di- and polysulfide_bonds between chains, which
limits the degrees_of_freedom and results in chains that tighten more quickly
for a given strain, thereby increasing the elastic force constant and making
the rubber harder and less extensible.
**** Malodour[edit] ****
Raw rubber storage depots and rubber processing can produce malodour that is
serious enough to become a source of complaints and protest to those living in
the vicinity.[17]
Microbial impurities originate during the processing of block rubber. These
impurities break down during storage or thermal degradation and produce
volatile organic compounds. Examination of these compounds using gas
chromatography/mass_spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography (GC) indicates
that they contain sulphur, ammonia, alkenes, ketones, esters, hydrogen
sulphite, nitrogen, and low molecular weight fatty acids (C2-C5).[18][19]
When latex concentrate is produced from rubber, sulphuric acid is used for
coagulation. This produces malodourous hydrogen sulphide.[19]
The industry can mitigate these bad odours with scrubber_systems.[19]
***** Chemical makeup[edit] *****

Chemical structure of cis-polyisoprene, the main constituent of natural rubber.
Synthetic cis-polyisoprene and natural cis-polyisoprene are derived from
different precursors, isopentenyl_pyrophosphate and isoprene.
Latex is the polymer cis-1,4-polyisoprene â with a molecular_weight of
100,000 to 1,000,000 daltons. Typically, a small percentage (up to 5% of dry
mass) of other materials, such as proteins, fatty_acids, resins, and inorganic
materials (salts) are found in natural rubber. Polyisoprene can also be created
synthetically, producing what is sometimes referred to as "synthetic natural
rubber", but the synthetic and natural routes are different.[1] Some natural
rubber sources, such as gutta-percha, are composed of trans-1,4-polyisoprene, a
structural_isomer that has similar properties.
Natural rubber is an elastomer and a thermoplastic. Once the rubber is
vulcanized, it is a thermoset. Most rubber in everyday use is vulcanized to a
point where it shares properties of both; i.e., if it is heated and cooled, it
is degraded but not destroyed.
The final properties of a rubber item depend not just on the polymer, but also
on modifiers and fillers, such as carbon_black, factice, whiting and others.
**** Biosynthesis[edit] ****
Rubber particles are formed in the cytoplasm of specialized latex-producing
cells called laticifers within rubber plants.[20] Rubber particles are
surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane with hydrophobic tails pointed
inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at the
surface of the growing rubber particle, which allows new monomeric units to be
added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The rubber
particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of
material, the rubber particle, a biomembrane and free monomeric units. The
biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge
along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone.[21] Free monomeric units
and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is
isopentenyl_pyrophosphate (an allylic compound), which elongates by Mg2+-
dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to
the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer.[22] The process displaces the
terminal high-energy pyrophosphate. The reaction produces a cis polymer. The
initiation step is catalyzed by prenyltransferase, which converts three
monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into farnesyl_pyrophosphate.[23] The
farnesyl pyrophosphate can bind to rubber transferase to elongate a new rubber
polymer.
The required isopentenyl pyrophosphate is obtained from the mevalonate pathway,
which derives from acetyl-CoA in the cytosol. In plants, isoprene pyrophosphate
can also be obtained from the 1-deox-D-xyulose-5-phosphate/2-C-methyl-D-
erythritol-4-phosphate pathway within plasmids.[24] The relative ratio of the
farnesyl pyrophosphate initiator unit and isoprenyl pyrophosphate elongation
monomer determines the rate of new particle synthesis versus elongation of
existing particles. Though rubber is known to be produced by only one enzyme,
extracts of latex host numerous small molecular weight proteins with unknown
function. The proteins possibly serve as cofactors, as the synthetic rate
decreases with complete removal.[25]

Rubber is generally cultivated in large plantations. The image shows a coconut
shell used in collecting latex, in plantations in Kerala, India.
More than 28 million tons of rubber were produced in 2017, of which
approximately 47% was natural. Since the bulk is synthetic, which is derived
from petroleum, the price of natural rubber is determined, to a large extent,
by the prevailing global price of crude oil.[26][27][28] Asia was the main
source of natural rubber, accounting for about 94% of output in 2005. The three
largest producers, Thailand, Indonesia (2.4 million tons)[29] and Malaysia,
together account for around 72% of all natural rubber production. Natural
rubber is not cultivated widely in its native continent of South America due to
the existence of South American leaf blight, and other natural predators.
**** Cultivation[edit] ****
Rubber latex is extracted from rubber trees. The economic life period of rubber
trees in plantations is around 32 years â up to 7 years of immature phase and
about 25 years of productive phase.
The soil requirement is well-drained, weathered soil consisting of laterite,
lateritic types, sedimentary types, nonlateritic red or alluvial soils.
The climatic conditions for optimum growth of rubber trees are:
    * Rainfall of around 250 centimetres (98 in) evenly distributed without any
      marked dry season and with at least 100 rainy days per year
    * Temperature range of about 20 to 34 Â°C (68 to 93 Â°F), with a monthly
      mean of 25 to 28 Â°C (77 to 82 Â°F)
    * Atmospheric humidity of around 80%
    * About 2000 hours sunshine per year at the rate of six hours per day
      throughout the year
    * Absence of strong winds
Many high-yielding clones have been developed for commercial planting. These
clones yield more than 2,000 kilograms per hectare (1,800 lb/acre) of dry
rubber per year, under ideal conditions.
**** Collection[edit] ****
A woman in Sri_Lanka harvesting rubber, circa 1920
In places such as Kerala and Sri Lanka where coconuts are in abundance, the
half shell of coconut was used as the latex collection container. Glazed
pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became more common in Kerala and other
countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire
incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led
into the cup by a galvanised "spout" knocked into the bark. Tapping normally
takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is
highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-
spiral system, and a common daily "task" size is between 450 and 650 trees.
Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations
in timing, length and number of cuts are used. "Tappers would make a slash in
the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from
ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree.
Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut.
Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too
many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or
kill it."[30]
It is usual to tap a pannel at least twice, sometimes three times, during the
tree's life. The economic life of the tree depends on how well the tapping is
carried out, as the critical factor is bark consumption. A standard in Malaysia
for alternate daily tapping is 25 cm (vertical) bark consumption per year. The
latex-containing tubes in the bark ascend in a spiral to the right. For this
reason, tapping cuts usually ascend to the left to cut more tubes.
The trees drip latex for about four hours, stopping as latex coagulates
naturally on the tapping cut, thus blocking the latex tubes in the bark.
Tappers usually rest and have a meal after finishing their tapping work, then
start collecting the liquid "field latex" at about midday.
*** Field coagula[edit] ***
Mixed field coagula.
Smallholder's lump at a remilling factory
The four types of field coagula are "cuplump", "treelace", "smallholders' lump"
and "earth scrap". Each has significantly different properties.[31] Some trees
continue to drip after the collection leading to a small amount of "cup lump"
that is collected at the next tapping. The latex that coagulates on the cut is
also collected as "tree lace". Tree lace and cup lump together account for
10â20% of the dry rubber produced. Latex that drips onto the ground, "earth
scrap", is also collected periodically for processing of low-grade product.
** Cup lump[edit] **
Cup lump rubber coagula in a Myanmar road stall.
Cup lump is the coagulated material found in the collection cup when the tapper
next visits the tree to tap it again. It arises from latex clinging to the
walls of the cup after the latex was last poured into the bucket, and from
late-dripping latex exuded before the latex-carrying vessels of the tree become
blocked. It is of higher purity and of greater value than the other three
types.
** Tree lace[edit] **
Tree lace is the coagulum strip that the tapper peels off the previous cut
before making a new cut. It usually has higher copper and manganese contents
than cup lump. Both copper and manganese are pro-oxidants and can damage the
physical properties of the dry rubber.
** Smallholders' lump[edit] **
Smallholders' lump is produced by smallholders who collect rubber from trees
far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in
remote areas, tap dispersed trees on their way to work in the paddy fields and
collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often
impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that
processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as
the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the
smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container
available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the
latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with
plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to
coagulate the latex â a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care
is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are
formed, which may also include tree lace.
** Earth scrap[edit] **
Earth scrap is material that gathers around the base of the tree. It arises
from latex overflowing from the cut and running down the bark, from rain
flooding a collection cup containing latex, and from spillage from tappers'
buckets during collection. It contains soil and other contaminants, and has
variable rubber content, depending on the amount of contaminants. Earth scrap
is collected by field workers two or three times a year and may be cleaned in a
scrap-washer to recover the rubber, or sold to a contractor who cleans it and
recovers the rubber. It is of low quality.
**** Processing[edit] ****
Removing coagulum from coagulating troughs.
Latex coagulates in the cups if kept for long and must be collected before this
happens. The collected latex, "field latex", is transferred into coagulation
tanks for the preparation of dry rubber or transferred into air-tight
containers with sieving for ammoniation. Ammoniation preserves the latex in a
colloidal state for longer periods of time.
Latex is generally processed into either latex concentrate for manufacture of
dipped goods or coagulated under controlled, clean conditions using formic
acid. The coagulated latex can then be processed into the higher-grade,
technically specified block rubbers such as SVR 3L or SVR CV or used to produce
Ribbed Smoke Sheet grades.
Naturally coagulated rubber (cup lump) is used in the manufacture of TSR10 and
TSR20 grade rubbers. Processing for these grades is a size reduction and
cleaning process to remove contamination and prepare the material for the final
stage of drying.[32]
The dried material is then baled and palletized for storage and shipment.

Main article: Sulfur_vulcanization
Torn latex rubber dry suit wrist seal
Natural rubber is often vulcanized - a process by which the rubber is heated
and sulfur, peroxide or bisphenol are added to improve resistance and
elasticity and to prevent it from perishing. Carbon_black is often used as an
additive to rubber to improve its strength, especially in vehicle tires, which
account for about 70% (~9 million tons) of carbon black production.
**** Transportation[edit] ****
Natural rubber latex is shipped from factories in south-east Asia, South
America, and West and Center Africa to destinations around the world. As the
cost of natural rubber has risen significantly and rubber products are dense,
the shipping methods offering the lowest cost per unit weight are preferred.
Depending on destination, warehouse availability, and transportation
conditions, some methods are preferred by certain buyers. In international
trade, latex rubber is mostly shipped in 20-foot ocean containers. Inside the
container, smaller containers are used to store the latex.[33]

Uncured rubber is used for cements;[34] for adhesive, insulating, and friction
tapes; and for crepe rubber used in insulating blankets and footwear.
Vulcanized_rubber has many more applications. Resistance to abrasion makes
softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor
belts, and makes hard rubber valuable for pump housings and piping used in the
handling of abrasive sludge.
The flexibility of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices
ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity
makes it suitable for various kinds of shock absorbers and for specialized
machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas
impermeability makes it useful in the manufacture of articles such as air
hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to
the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear,
and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks,
processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical
resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves,
shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone
housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The
coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet
surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-
lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls
are made of rubber.
Around 25 million tonnes of rubber are produced each year, of which 30 percent
is natural.[35] The remainder is synthetic rubber derived from petrochemical
sources. The top end of latex production results in latex products such as
surgeons' gloves, condoms, balloons and other relatively high-value products.
The mid-range which comes from the technically specified natural rubber
materials ends up largely in tires but also in conveyor belts, marine products,
windshield wipers and miscellaneous goods. Natural rubber offers good
elasticity, while synthetic materials tend to offer better resistance to
environmental factors such as oils, temperature, chemicals and ultraviolet
light. "Cured rubber" is rubber that has been compounded and subjected to the
vulcanisation process to create cross-links within the rubber matrix.
***** Allergic reactions[edit] *****
Main article: Latex_allergy
Some people have a serious latex_allergy, and exposure to natural latex rubber
products such as latex_gloves can cause anaphylactic_shock. The antigenic
proteins found in Hevea latex may be deliberately reduced (though not
eliminated)[36] through processing.
Latex from non-Hevea sources, such as Guayule, can be used without allergic
reaction by persons with an allergy to Hevea latex.[37]
Some allergic reactions are not to the latex itself, but from residues of
chemicals used to accelerate the cross-linking process. Although this may be
confused with an allergy to latex, it is distinct from it, typically taking the
form of Type_IV_hypersensitivity in the presence of traces of specific
processing chemicals.[36][38]
***** Microbial degradation[edit] *****
Natural rubber is susceptible to degradation by a wide range of bacteria
