Concurrent engineering (CE) is a work methodology emphasizing the
parallelization of tasks (i.e. performing tasks concurrently), which is
sometimes called simultaneous engineering or integrated product development
(IPD) using an integrated_product_team approach. It refers to an approach used
in product_development in which functions of design engineering, manufacturing
engineering, and other functions are integrated to reduce the time required to
bring a new product to market.[1]

***** Introduction[edit] *****
A 2008 publication described concurrent engineering as a new design management
system that has matured in recent years to become a well-defined systems
approach to optimizing design and engineering cycles.[2] Concurrent engineering
has been implemented in a number of companies, organizations, and universities,
most notably in the aerospace industry. Beginning in the early 1990s, CE was
also adapted for use in the information and content automation field, providing
a basis for organization and management of projects outside the physical
product development sector for which it was originally designed. Organizations
such as the European_Space_Agency's Concurrent_Design_Facility make use of
concurrent design to perform feasibility studies for future missions.
The basic premise for concurrent engineering revolves around two concepts. The
first is the idea that all elements of a product's life-cycleâfrom
functionality, production, assembly, testing, maintenance, environmental
impact, and finally disposal and recyclingâshould be taken into careful
consideration in the early design phases.[3]
The second concept is that design activities should all be occurring at the
same time, i.e., concurrently. The idea is that the concurrent nature of these
activities significantly increases productivity and product quality.[4] This
way, errors and redesigns can be discovered early in the design process when
the project is still flexible. By locating and fixing these issues early, the
design team can avoid what often become costly errors as the project moves to
more complicated computational models and eventually into the actual
manufacturing of hardware.[5]
As mentioned above, part of the design process is to ensure that the product's
entire life cycle is taken into consideration. This includes establishing user
requirements, propagating early conceptual designs, running computational
models, creating physical prototypes, and eventually manufacturing the product.
Included in this process is taking into full account funding, workforce
capability, and time requirements. A 2006 study claimed that a correct
implementation of the concurrent design process can save a significant amount
of money, and that organizations have been moving to concurrent design for this
reason.[4] It is also highly compatible with systems_thinking and green
engineering.
Concurrent engineering replaces the more traditional sequential design flow, or
"Waterfall Model".[6][7] In Concurrent Engineering an iterative or integrated
development method is used instead.[8] The Waterfall method moves in a linear
fashion, starting with user requirements and sequentially moving forward to
design and implementation, until you have a finished product. In this design
system, a design team would not quickly look backward or forward from the step
it is on to fix or anticipate problems. In the case that something does go
wrong, the design usually must be scrapped or heavily altered. The concurrent
or iterative design process encourages prompt changes of tack, so that all
aspects of the life cycle of the product are taken into account, allowing for a
more evolutionary approach to design.[9] The difference between the two design
processes can be seen graphically in Figure 1.
Traditional "Waterfall" or Sequential Development Method vs. Iterative
Development Method in concurrent engineering.
A significant part of the concurrent design method is that the individual
engineer is given much more say in the overall design process due to the
collaborative nature of concurrent engineering. Giving the designer ownership
is claimed to improve the productivity of the employee and quality of the
product, based on the assumption that people who are given a sense of
gratification and ownership over their work tend to work harder and design a
more robust product, as opposed to an employee that is assigned a task with
little say in the general process.[5]
**** Challenges associated with concurrent design[edit] ****
Concurrent design comes with a series of challenges, such as implementation of
early design reviews, dependency on efficient communication between engineers
and teams, software compatibility, and opening up the design process.[10] This
design process usually requires that computer models (computer_aided_design,
finite_element_analysis) are exchanged efficiently, something that can be
difficult in practice. If such issues are not addressed properly, concurrent
design may not work effectively.[11] It is important to note that although the
nature of some project activities project imposes a degree of
linearityâcompletion of software code, prototype development and testing, for
exampleâorganizing and managing project teams to facilitate concurrent design
can still yield significant benefits that come from the improved sharing of
information.
Service providers exist that specialize in this field, not only training people
how to perform concurrent design effectively, but also providing the tools to
enhance the communication between the team members.
***** Elements[edit] *****
**** Cross-functional teams[edit] ****
Cross-functional teams include people from different area of the workplace that
are all involved in a particular process, including manufacturing, hardware and
software design, marketing, and so forth.
**** Concurrent product realization[edit] ****
Doing several things at once, such as designing various subsystems
simultaneously, is critical to reducing design time and is at the heart of
concurrent engineering.
**** Incremental information sharing[edit] ****
Incremental information sharing helps minimize the chance that concurrent
product realization will lead to surprises. "Incremental" meaning that as soon
as new information becomes available, it is shared and integrated into the
design. Cross-functional teams are important to the effective sharing of
information in a timely fashion.
**** Integrated project management[edit] ****
Integrated project management ensures that someone is responsible for the
entire project, and that responsibility is not abdicated once one aspect of the
work is done.
***** Definition[edit] *****
Several definitions of concurrent engineering are in use.
The first one is used by the Concurrent_Design_Facility (ESA):
    Concurrent Engineering (CE) is a systematic approach to integrated
    product development that emphasizes the response to customer
âexpectations. It embodies team values of co-operation, trust and   â
    sharing in such a manner that decision making is by consensus,
    involving all perspectives in parallel, from the beginning of the
    product_life_cycle.
The second one is by Winner, et al., 1988:
    Concurrent Engineering is a systematic approach to the integrated,
    concurrent design of products and their related processes, including,
âmanufacturing and support. This approach is intended to cause the       â
    developers from the very outset to consider all elements of the product
    life cycle, from conception to disposal, including quality, cost,
    schedule, and user requirements.[12]

Currently, several companies, agencies and universities use CE. Among them can
be mentioned:

    * NASA Integrated_Design_Center_(IDC),_Mission_Design_Lab_(MDL),_and
      Instrument_Design_Lab_(IDL) - Goddard Space Flight Center

    * ASI â Italian Space Agency
    * Boeing
    * EADS_Astrium â Satellite Design Office
