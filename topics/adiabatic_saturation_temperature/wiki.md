The wet-bulb temperature (WBT) is the temperature read by a thermometer covered
in water-soaked cloth (wet-bulb_thermometer) over which air is passed.[1] At
100% relative_humidity, the wet-bulb temperature is equal to the air
temperature (dry-bulb_temperature) and it is lower at lower humidity. It is
defined as the temperature of a parcel of air cooled to saturation (100%
relative humidity) by the evaporation of water into it, with the latent_heat
supplied by the parcel.[2] A wet-bulb thermometer indicates a temperature close
to the true (thermodynamic) wet-bulb temperature. The wet-bulb temperature is
the lowest temperature that can be reached under current ambient_conditions by
the evaporation of water only.

***** Intuition[edit] *****
Consider a thermometer wrapped in a water-moistened cloth. The drier, less
humid the air, the faster the water will evaporate. The faster water
evaporates, the lower the thermometer's temperature will be relative to air
temperature.
But water can only evaporate if the air around it can absorb more water. This
is measured by comparing how much water is in the air, compared to the maximum
which could be in the airâthe relative_humidity. 0% means the air is
completely dry, and 100% means the air contains all the water it can hold in
the present circumstances and it cannot absorb any more water (from any
source).
This is why we feel cooler in dry air. The drier the air, the more moisture it
can hold beyond what is already in it, and the easier it is for extra water to
evaporate. The result is that sweat evaporates more quickly in drier air,
cooling down the skin faster. But if the relative humidity is 100%, no water
can evaporate, and cooling by sweating or evaporation is not possible.
When relative humidity is 100%, a wet bulb thermometer can also no longer be
cooled by evaporation, so it will read the same as an unwrapped thermometer.
***** General[edit] *****
The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature which may be achieved by
evaporative_cooling of a water-wetted (or even ice-covered), ventilated
surface.
By contrast, the dew_point is the temperature to which the ambient air must be
cooled to reach 100% relative_humidity assuming there is no further evaporation
into the air; it is the point where condensation (dew) and clouds would form.
For a parcel of air that is less than saturated (i.e., air with less than 100
percent relative humidity), the wet-bulb temperature is lower than the dry-bulb
temperature, but higher than the dew point temperature. The lower the relative
humidity (the drier the air), the greater the gaps between each pair of these
three temperatures. Conversely, when the relative humidity rises to 100%, the
three figures coincide.
For air at a known pressure and dry-bulb temperature, the thermodynamic wet-
bulb temperature corresponds to unique values of the relative humidity and the
dew point temperature. It therefore may be used for the practical determination
of these values. The relationships between these values are illustrated in a
psychrometric_chart.
Cooling of the human body through perspiration is inhibited as the relative
humidity of the surrounding air increases in summer. Other mechanisms may be at
work in winter if there is validity to the notion of a "humid" or "damp cold."
Lower wet-bulb temperatures that correspond with drier air in summer can
translate to energy savings in air-conditioned buildings due to:
   1. Reduced dehumidification load for ventilation air
   2. Increased efficiency of cooling_towers
***** Thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature (adiabatic saturation temperature)
[edit] *****
The thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is the temperature a volume of air would
have if cooled adiabatically to saturation by evaporation of water into it, all
latent heat being supplied by the volume of air.
The temperature of an air sample that has passed over a large surface of the
liquid water in an insulated channel is called the thermodynamic wet-bulb
temperatureâthe air has become saturated by passing through a constant-
pressure, ideal, adiabatic saturation chamber.
Meteorologists and others may use the term "isobaric wet-bulb temperature" to
refer to the "thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature". It is also called the
"adiabatic saturation temperature", though it should be pointed out that
meteorologists also use "adiabatic saturation temperature" to mean "temperature
at the saturation level", i.e. the temperature the parcel would achieve if it
expanded adiabatically until saturated.[3]
Thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is plotted on a psychrometric_chart.
The thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is a thermodynamic_property of a mixture
of air and water vapour. The value indicated by a simple wet-bulb thermometer
often provides an adequate approximation of the thermodynamic wet-bulb
temperature.
For an accurate wet-bulb thermometer, "the wet-bulb temperature and the
adiabatic saturation temperature are approximately equal for air-water vapor
mixtures at atmospheric temperature and pressure. This is not necessarily true
at temperatures and pressures that deviate significantly from ordinary
atmospheric conditions, or for other gasâvapor mixtures."[4]

A Wet Dry Hygrometer featuring a wet-bulb thermometer
A sling psychrometer. The sock is wet with distilled water and whirled around
for a minute or more before taking the readings.
Wet-bulb temperature is measured using a thermometer that has its bulb wrapped
in clothâcalled a sockâthat is kept wet with distilled water via wicking
action. Such an instrument is called a wet-bulb thermometer. A widely used
device for measuring wet and dry bulb temperature is a sling psychrometer,
which consists of a pair of mercury bulb thermometers, one with a wet "sock" to
measure the wet-bulb temperature and the other with the bulb exposed and dry
for the dry-bulb temperature. The thermometers are attached to a swivelling
handle which allows them to be whirled around so that water evaporates from the
sock and cools the wet bulb until it reaches thermal_equilibrium.
An actual wet-bulb thermometer reads a temperature that is slightly different
from the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature, but they are very close in value.
This is due to a coincidence: for a water-air system the psychrometric ratio
(see below) happens to be close to 1, although for systems other than air and
water they might not be close.
To understand why this is so, first consider the calculation of the
thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature.
Experiment 1
In this case, a stream of unsaturated air is cooled. The heat from cooling that
air is used to evaporate some water which increases the humidity of the air. At
some point the air becomes saturated with water vapour (and has cooled to the
thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature). In this case we can write the following
balance of energy per mass of dry air:
   (  H   s a t    &#x2212;  H  0   ) &#x22C5; &#x03BB; = (  T  0   &#x2212;  T
s a t    ) &#x22C5;  c   s      {\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot
\lambda =(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} })\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }}
[{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda =(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm
{sat} })\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }}]
    *     H   s a t      {\displaystyle H_{\mathrm {sat} }}  [H_{\mathrm {sat}
      }] saturated water content of the air (kgH2O/kgdry air)
    *     H  0     {\displaystyle H_{0}}  [H_{0}] initial water content of the
      air (same unit as above)
    *    &#x03BB;   {\displaystyle \lambda }  [\lambda ] latent heat of water
      (J/kgH2O)
    *     T  0     {\displaystyle T_{0}}  [T_{0}] initial air temperature (K)
    *     T   s a t      {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {sat} }}  [T_{\mathrm {sat}
      }] saturated air temperature (K)
    *     c  s     {\displaystyle c_{s}}  [c_{s}] specific heat of air (J/
      kgÂ·K)
Experiment 2
For the case of the wet-bulb thermometer, imagine a drop of water with
unsaturated air blowing over it. As long as the vapor pressure of water in the
drop (function of its temperature) is greater than the partial pressure of
water vapor in the air stream, evaporation will take place. Initially, the heat
required for the evaporation will come from the drop itself since the fastest
moving water molecules are most likely to escape the surface of the drop, so
the remaining water molecules will have a lower average speed and therefore a
lower temperature. If this were the only thing that happened and the air
started bone dry, if the air blew sufficiently fast then its partial pressure
of water vapor would remain constantly zero and the drop would get infinitely
cold.[citation_needed]
Clearly this doesn't happen. It turns out that, as the drop starts cooling,
it's now colder than the air, so convective heat transfer begins to occur from
the air to the drop. Also, understand that the evaporation rate depends on the
difference of concentration of water vapor between the drop-stream interface
and the distant stream (i.e. the "original" stream, unaffected by the drop) and
on a convective mass transfer coefficient, which is a function of the
components of the mixture (i.e. water and air).
After a certain period, an equilibrium is reached: the drop has cooled to a
point where the rate of heat carried away in evaporation is equal to the heat
gain through convection. At this point, the following balance of energy per
interface area is true:
   (  H   s a t    &#x2212;  H  0   ) &#x22C5; &#x03BB; &#x22C5;  k &#x2032;  =
(  T  0   &#x2212;  T   e q    ) &#x22C5;  h   c      {\displaystyle (H_
{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda \cdot k'=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot h_
{\mathrm {c} }}
[{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda \cdot k'=(T_{0}-T_
{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot h_{\mathrm {c} }}]
    *     H   s a t      {\displaystyle H_{\mathrm {sat} }}  [H_{\mathrm {sat}
      }] water content of interface at equilibrium (kgH2O/kgdry air) (note that
      the air in this region is and has always been saturated)
    *     H  0     {\displaystyle H_{0}}  [H_{0}] water content of the distant
      air (same unit as above)
    *     k &#x2032;    {\displaystyle k'}  [k'] mass transfer coefficient (kg/
      mÂ²âs)
    *     T  0     {\displaystyle T_{0}}  [T_{0}] air temperature at distance
      (K)
    *     T   e q      {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {eq} }}  [T_{\mathrm {eq} }]
      water drop temperature at equilibrium (K)
    *     h   c      {\displaystyle h_{\mathrm {c} }}  [h_{\mathrm {c} }]
      convective heat transfer coefficient (W/mÂ²Â·K)
Note that:
    *    ( H &#x2212;  H  0   )   {\displaystyle (H-H_{0})}  [(H-H_{0})] is the
      driving force for mass transfer (constantly equal to      H   s a t
      &#x2212;  H  0     {\displaystyle H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0}}  [H_{\mathrm
      {sat} }-H_{0}] throughout the entire experiment)
    *    (  T  0   &#x2212; T )   {\displaystyle (T_{0}-T)}  [(T_{0}-T)] is the
      driving force for heat transfer (when     T   {\displaystyle T}  [T]
      reaches      T   e q      {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {eq} }}  [T_{\mathrm
      {eq} }], the equilibrium is reached)
Let us rearrange that equation into:
   (  H   s a t    &#x2212;  H  0   ) &#x22C5; &#x03BB; = (  T  0   &#x2212;  T
e q    ) &#x22C5;    h   c     k &#x2032;      {\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat}
}-H_{0})\cdot \lambda =(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}
{k'}}}
[{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda =(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq}
})\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'}}}]
Now let's go back to our original "thermodynamic wet-bulb" experiment,
Experiment 1. If the air stream is the same in both experiments (i.e.      H  0
{\displaystyle H_{0}}  [H_{0}] and      T  0     {\displaystyle T_{0}}  [T_{0}]
are the same), then we can equate the right-hand sides of both equations:
   (  T  0   &#x2212;  T   s a t    ) &#x22C5;  c   s    = (  T  0   &#x2212;
T   e q    ) &#x22C5;    h   c     k &#x2032;      {\displaystyle (T_{0}-T_
{\mathrm {sat} })\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac
{h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'}}}
[{\displaystyle (T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} })\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }=(T_{0}-T_
{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'}}}]
Rearranging a little bit:
    T  0   &#x2212;  T   s a t    = (  T  0   &#x2212;  T   e q    ) &#x22C5;
h   c      k &#x2032;  &#x22C5;  c   s         {\displaystyle T_{0}-T_{\mathrm
{sat} }=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'\cdot c_
{\mathrm {s} }}}}
[{\displaystyle T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} }=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac
{h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }}}}]
It is clear now that if         h   c      k &#x2032;   c   s        = 1
{\displaystyle {\dfrac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'c_{\mathrm {s} }}}=1}  [{\dfrac {h_
{\mathrm {c} }}{k'c_{\mathrm {s} }}}=1] then the temperature of the drop in
Experiment 2 is the same as the wet-bulb temperature in Experiment 1. Due to a
coincidence, for the mixture of air and water vapor this is the case, the ratio
(called psychrometric ratio) being close to 1.[5]
Experiment 2 is what happens in a common wet-bulb thermometer. That's why its
reading is fairly close to the thermodynamic ("real") wet-bulb temperature.
Experimentally, the wet-bulb thermometer reads closest to the thermodynamic
wet-bulb temperature if:
    * The sock is shielded from radiant heat exchange with its surroundings
    * Air flows past the sock quickly enough to prevent evaporated moisture
      from affecting evaporation from the sock
    * The water supplied to the sock is at the same temperature as the
      thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature of the air
In practice the value reported by a wet-bulb thermometer differs slightly from
the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature because:
    * The sock is not perfectly shielded from radiant heat exchange
    * Air flow rate past the sock may be less than optimum
    * The temperature of the water supplied to the sock is not controlled
At relative humidities below 100 percent, water evaporates from the bulb which
cools the bulb below ambient temperature. To determine relative humidity,
ambient temperature is measured using an ordinary thermometer, better known in
this context as a dry-bulb_thermometer. At any given ambient temperature, less
relative humidity results in a greater difference between the dry-bulb and wet-
bulb temperatures; the wet-bulb is colder. The precise relative humidity is
determined by reading from a psychrometric_chart of wet-bulb versus dry-bulb
temperatures, or by calculation.
Psychrometers are instruments with both a wet-bulb and a dry-bulb thermometer.
A wet-bulb thermometer can also be used outdoors in sunlight in combination
with a globe thermometer (which measures the incident radiant_temperature) to
calculate the Wet_Bulb_Globe_Temperature (WBGT).
***** Adiabatic wet-bulb temperature[edit] *****
The adiabatic wet-bulb temperature is the temperature a volume of air would
have if cooled adiabatically to saturation and then compressed adiabatically to
the original pressure in a moist-adiabatic process[clarification_needed] (AMS
Glossary[clarification_needed]). Such cooling may occur as air pressure reduces
with altitude[clarification_needed], as noted in the article on lifted
condensation_level.
This term, as defined in this article, may be[vague] most prevalent in
meteorology.
As the value referred to as "thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature" is also
achieved via an adiabatic process, some engineers and others may use[vague] the
term "adiabatic wet-bulb temperature" to refer to the "thermodynamic wet-bulb
temperature". As mentioned above, meteorologists and others may use[vague] the
term "isobaric wet-bulb temperature" to refer to the "thermodynamic wet-bulb
temperature".
"The relationship between the isobaric and adiabatic processes is quite
obscure. Comparisons indicate, however, that the two temperatures are rarely
different by more than a few tenths of a degree Celsius, and the adiabatic
version is always the smaller of the two for unsaturated air. Since the
difference is so small, it is usually neglected in practice."[6]
***** Wet-bulb depression[edit] *****
The wet-bulb depression is the difference between the dry-bulb temperature and
the wet-bulb temperature. If there is 100% humidity, dry-bulb and wet-bulb
temperatures are identical, making the wet-bulb depression equal to zero in
such conditions.[7]
***** Wet-bulb temperature and health[edit] *****

Living organisms can survive only within a certain temperature range. When the
ambient temperature is excessive, humans and many animals cool themselves below
ambient by evaporative_cooling (sweat in humans and horses, saliva and water in
dogs and other mammals); this helps to prevent potentially fatal hyperthermia
due to heat stress. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling depends upon
humidity; wet-bulb temperature, or more complex calculated quantities such as
Wet_Bulb_Globe_Temperature (WBGT) which also takes account of solar_radiation,
give a useful indication of the degree of heat stress, and are used by several
agencies as the basis for heat stress prevention guidelines.
A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding 35 Â°C (95 Â°F) is likely to be
fatal even to fit and healthy people, unclothed in the shade next to a fan; at
this temperature our bodies switch from shedding heat to the environment, to
gaining heat from it.[8] Thus 35 Â°C (95 Â°F) is the threshold beyond which the
body is no longer able to adequately cool itself. A study by NOAA from 2013
concluded that heat stress will reduce labor capacity considerably under
current emissions scenarios.[9]
A 2010 study concluded that under a worst-case scenario for global_warming with
temperatures 12 Â°C (22 Â°F) higher than 2007, the wet-bulb temperature limit
for humans could be exceeded around much of the world in future centuries.[10]
A 2015 study concluded that parts of the globe could become uninhabitable.[11]
An example of the threshold at which the human body is no longer able to cool
itself and begins to overheat is a humidity level of 50% and a high heat of
46 Â°C (115 Â°F), as this would indicate a wet-bulb temperature of 35 Â°C
(95 Â°F).[12]
In 2018, South_Carolina implemented new regulations to protect high school
students from heat-related emergencies during outdoor activities. Specific
guidelines and restrictions are in place for wet-bulb temperatures between
82.0 Â°F (27.8 Â°C) and 92.0 Â°F (33.3 Â°C); wet-bulb temperatures of 92.1 Â°F
(33.4 Â°C) or greater require all outdoor activities to be canceled.[13][14]
**** Heat waves with high humidity[edit] ****
    * In 2003, Dhahran,_Saudi_Arabia, saw the highest heat index[clarification
      needed] ever recorded at 81 Â°C (178 Â°F) with a temperature of 42 Â°C
      (108 Â°F) and a 35 Â°C (95 Â°F) dew point.[15]
    * The 2015_Indian_heat_wave saw wet-bulb temperatures in Andhra_Pradesh
      reach 30 Â°C (86 Â°F). A similar wet-bulb temperature was reached during
      the 1995_Chicago_heat_wave.[16]
    * A heat wave in August 2015 saw temperatures of 48.6 Â°C (119.5 Â°F) and a
      dew point of 29.5 Â°C (85.1 Â°F) at Samawah, Iraq, and 114.8 Â°F
      (46.0 Â°C) with a dew point of 89.6 Â°F (32.0 Â°C) in Bandar-e_Mahshahr,
      Iran.[17] This implied wet-bulb temperatures of about 33.5 Â°C (92.3 Â°F)
      and 34.7 Â°C (94.5 Â°F) respectively.[18] The government urged residents
      to stay out of the sun and drink plenty of water.
