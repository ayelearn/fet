The process of change in the species structure of an ecological community over
time
Succession after disturbance: a boreal_forest one year (left) and two years
(right) after a wildfire.
Ecological succession is the process of change in the species structure of an
ecological_community over time. The time scale can be decades (for example,
after a wildfire), or even millions of years after a mass_extinction.[1]
The community begins with relatively few pioneering_plants_and_animals and
develops through increasing complexity until it becomes stable or self-
perpetuating as a climax_community. The "engine" of succession, the cause of
ecosystem change, is the impact of established organisms upon their own
environments. A consequence of living is the sometimes subtle and sometimes
overt alteration of one's own environment.[2]
It is a phenomenon or process by which an ecological_community undergoes more
or less orderly and predictable changes following a disturbance or the initial
colonization of a new habitat. Succession may be initiated either by formation
of new, unoccupied habitat, such as from a lava_flow or a severe landslide, or
by some form of disturbance of a community, such as from a fire, severe
windthrow, or logging. Succession that begins in new habitats, uninfluenced by
pre-existing communities is called primary_succession, whereas succession that
follows disruption of a pre-existing community is called secondary_succession.
Succession was among the first theories advanced in ecology. Ecological
succession was first documented in the Indiana Dunes of Northwest Indiana and
remains at the core of ecological_science.[3]

***** History[edit] *****
Precursors of the idea of ecological succession go back to the beginning of the
19th century. The French naturalist Adolphe_Dureau_de_la_Malle was the first to
make use of the word succession concerning the vegetation development after
forest clear-cutting. In 1859 Henry_David_Thoreau wrote an address called "The
Succession of Forest Trees"[4] in which he described succession in an oak-pine
forest. "It has long been known to observers that squirrels bury nuts in the
ground, but I am not aware that any one has thus accounted for the regular
succession of forests."[5] The Austrian botanist Anton_Kerner published a study
about the succession of plants in the Danube river basin in 1863.[6]
**** H. C. Cowles[edit] ****
The Indiana Dunes on Lake Michigan, which stimulated Cowles' development of his
theories of ecological succession
Henry_Chandler_Cowles, at the University_of_Chicago, developed a more formal
concept of succession. Inspired by studies of Danish dunes by Eugen_Warming,
Cowles studied vegetation development on sand dunes on the shores of Lake
Michigan (the Indiana_Dunes). He recognized that vegetation on dunes of
different ages might be interpreted as different stages of a general trend of
vegetation development on dunes (an approach to the study of vegetation change
later termed space-for-time substitution, or chronosequence studies). He first
published this work as a paper in the Botanical Gazette in 1899 ("The
ecological relations of the vegetation of the sand dunes of Lake Michigan").[7]
In this classic publication and subsequent papers, he formulated the idea of
primary succession and the notion of a sereâa repeatable sequence of
community changes specific to particular environmental circumstances.[3][8]
**** Gleason and Clements[edit] ****
From about 1900 to 1960, however, understanding of succession was dominated by
the theories of Frederic_Clements, a contemporary of Cowles, who held that
seres were highly predictable and deterministic and converged on a climatically
determined stable climax_community regardless of starting conditions. Clements
explicitly analogized the successional development of ecological communities
with ontogenetic development of individual organisms, and his model is often
referred to as the pseudo-organismic theory of community ecology. Clements and
his followers developed a complex taxonomy of communities and successional
pathways.
Henry_Gleason offered a contrasting framework as early as the 1920s. The
Gleasonian model was more complex and much less deterministic than the
Clementsian. It differs most fundamentally from the Clementsian view in
suggesting a much greater role of chance_factors and in denying the existence
of coherent, sharply bounded community types. Gleason argued that species
distributions responded individualistically to environmental factors, and
communities were best regarded as artifacts of the juxtaposition of species
distributions. Gleason's ideas, first published in 1926, were largely ignored
until the late 1950s.
Two quotes illustrate the contrasting views of Clements and Gleason. Clements
wrote in 1916:
     The developmental study of vegetation necessarily rests upon the
     assumption that the unit or climax formation is an organic entity. As
     an organism the formation arises, grows, matures, and dies.
     Furthermore, each climax formation is able to reproduce itself,
     repeating with essential fidelity the stages of its development.
     â Frederic Clements[9]
while Gleason, in his 1926 paper, said:
     An association is not an organism, scarcely even a vegetational unit,
     but merely a coincidence.
     â Henry Gleason[10]
Gleason's ideas were, in fact, more consistent with Cowles' original thinking
about succession. About Clements' distinction between primary_succession and
secondary_succession, Cowles wrote (1911):
     This classification seems not to be of fundamental value, since it
     separates such closely related phenomena as those of erosion and
     deposition, and it places together such unlike things as human
     agencies and the subsidence of land.
     â Henry Cowles[11]
**** Modern era[edit] ****
A more rigorous, data-driven testing of successional models and community
theory generally began with the work of Robert_Whittaker and John_Curtis in the
1950s and 1960s. Succession theory has since become less monolithic and more
complex. J._Connell_and_R._Slatyer attempted a codification of successional
processes by mechanism. Among British and North American ecologists, the notion
of a stable climax_vegetation has been largely abandoned, and successional
processes have come to be seen as much less deterministic, with important roles
for historical contingency and for alternate pathways in the actual development
of communities. Debates continue as to the general predictability of
successional dynamics and the relative importance of equilibrial vs. non-
equilibrial processes. Former Harvard professor F. A. Bazzaz introduced the
notion of scale into the discussion, as he considered that at local or small
area scale the processes are stochastic and patchy, but taking bigger regional
areas into consideration, certain tendencies can not be denied.[12]
***** Factors[edit] *****
The trajectory of successional change can be influenced by site conditions, by
the character of the events initiating succession (perturbations), by the
interactions of the species present, and by more stochastic factors such as
availability of colonists or seeds or weather conditions at the time of
disturbance. Some of these factors contribute to predictability of succession
dynamics; others add more probabilistic elements. Two important perturbation
factors today are human_actions and climatic_change.[13]
In general, communities in early succession will be dominated by fast-growing,
well-dispersed species (opportunist, fugitive, or r-selected life-histories).
As succession proceeds, these species will tend to be replaced by more
competitive (k-selected) species.
Trends in ecosystem and community properties in succession have been suggested,
but few appear to be general. For example, species_diversity almost necessarily
increases during early succession as new species arrive, but may decline in
later succession as competition eliminates opportunistic species and leads to
dominance_by_locally_superior_competitors. Net_Primary_Productivity, biomass,
and trophic properties all show variable patterns over succession, depending on
the particular system and site.
Ecological succession was formerly seen as having a stable end-stage called the
climax, sometimes referred to as the 'potential vegetation' of a site, and
shaped primarily by the local climate. This idea has been largely abandoned by
modern ecologists in favor of nonequilibrium ideas of ecosystems dynamics. Most
natural ecosystems experience disturbance at a rate that makes a "climax"
community unattainable. Climate_change often occurs at a rate and frequency
sufficient to prevent arrival at a climax state. Additions to available species
pools through range expansions and introductions can also continually reshape
communities.
The development of some ecosystem attributes, such as soil_properties and
nutrient_cycles, are both influenced by community properties, and, in turn,
influence further successional development. This feed-back process may occur
only over centuries or millennia. Coupled with the stochastic nature of
disturbance events and other long-term (e.g., climatic) changes, such dynamics
make it doubtful whether the 'climax' concept ever applies or is particularly
useful in considering actual vegetation.
***** Types[edit] *****
Main articles: Primary_succession, Secondary_succession, and Cyclic_succession
**** Primary succession[edit] ****
Successional dynamics beginning with colonization of an area that has not been
previously occupied by an ecological community, such as newly exposed rock or
sand surfaces, lava flows, newly exposed glacial tills, etc., are referred to
as primary succession. The stages of primary succession include pioneer
microorganisms,[14] plants (lichens and mosses), grassy stage, smaller shrubs,
and trees. Animals begin to return when there is food there for them to eat.
When it is a fully functioning ecosystem, it has reached the climax community
stage.[15]
**** Secondary succession[edit] ****
An example of Secondary Succession by stages:
1. A stable deciduous forest community
2. A disturbance, such as a wild fire, destroys the forest
3. The fire burns the forest to the ground
4. The fire leaves behind empty, but not destroyed, soil
5. Grasses and other herbaceous plants grow back first
6. Small bushes and trees begin to colonize the area
7. Fast growing evergreen trees develop to their fullest, while shade-tolerant
trees develop in the understory
8. The short-lived and shade intolerant evergreen trees die as the larger
deciduous trees overtop them. The ecosystem is now back to a similar state to
where it began.
Successional dynamics following severe disturbance or removal of a pre-existing
community are called secondary succession. Dynamics in secondary succession are
strongly influenced by pre-disturbance conditions, including soil development,
seed banks, remaining organic matter, and residual living organisms. Because of
residual fertility and pre-existing organisms, community change in early stages
of secondary succession can be relatively rapid.
Secondary succession is much more commonly observed and studied than primary
succession. Particularly common types of secondary succession include responses
to natural disturbances such as fire, flood, and severe winds, and to human-
caused disturbances such as logging and agriculture. In secondary succession,
the soils and organisms need to be left unharmed so there is a way for the new
material to rebuild.[4]
As an example, in a fragmented old field habitat created in eastern Kansas,
woody plants "colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby
patches".[16]
Secondary succession: trees are colonizing uncultivated fields and meadows.
Secondary succession can quickly change a landscape. In the 1900s, Acadia
National_Park had a wildfire that destroyed much of the landscape. Originally
evergreen trees grew in the landscape. After the fire, the area took at least a
year to grow shrubs. Eventually, deciduous trees started to grow instead of
evergreens.[15]
Secondary succession has been occurring in Shenandoah_National_Park following
the 1995 flood of the Moorman's and Rapidan rivers, which destroyed plant and
animal life.[17]
**** Seasonal and cyclic dynamics[edit] ****
Unlike secondary succession, these types of vegetation change are not dependent
on disturbance but are periodic changes arising from fluctuating species
interactions or recurring events. These models modify the climax_concept
towards one of dynamic states.
**** Causes of plant succession[edit] ****
Autogenic_succession can be brought by changes in the soil caused by the
organisms there. These changes include accumulation of organic matter in litter
or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, or change in the pH of soil due
to the plants growing there. The structure of the plants themselves can also
alter the community. For example, when larger species like trees mature, they
produce shade on to the developing forest floor that tends to exclude light-
requiring species. Shade-tolerant species will invade the area.
Allogenic_succession is caused by external environmental influences and not by
the vegetation. For example, soil changes due to erosion, leaching or the
deposition of silt and clays can alter the nutrient content and water
relationships in the ecosystems. Animals also play an important role in
allogenic changes as they are pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores. They
can also increase nutrient content of the soil in certain areas, or shift soil
about (as termites, ants, and moles do) creating patches in the habitat. This
may create regeneration sites that favor certain species.
Climatic factors may be very important, but on a much longer time-scale than
any other. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will promote changes in
communities. As the climate warmed at the end of each ice age, great
successional changes took place. The tundra vegetation and bare glacial till
deposits underwent succession to mixed deciduous forest. The greenhouse_effect
resulting in increase in temperature is likely to bring profound Allogenic
changes in the next century. Geological and climatic catastrophes such as
volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, avalanches, meteors, floods, fires, and high
wind also bring allogenic changes.
**** Mechanisms[edit] ****
In 1916, Frederic_Clements published a descriptive theory of succession and
advanced it as a general ecological concept.[9] His theory of succession had a
powerful influence on ecological thought. Clements' concept is usually termed
classical ecological_theory. According to Clements, succession is a process
involving several phases:[9][page needed]
   1. Nudation: Succession begins with the development of a bare site, called
      Nudation (disturbance).[9]
   2. Migration: refers to arrival of propagules.[9]
   3. Ecesis: involves establishment and initial growth of vegetation.[9]
   4. Competition: as vegetation becomes well established, grows, and spreads,
      various species begin to compete for space, light and nutrients.[9]
   5. Reaction: during this phase autogenic changes such as the buildup of
      humus affect the habitat, and one plant community replaces another.[9]
   6. Stabilization: a supposedly stable climax community forms.[9]
***** Seral communities[edit] *****
Main article: Seral_community
Pond succession or sere A: emergent plant life B: sediment C: Emergent plants
grow inwards, sediment accretes D: emergent and terrestrial plants E: sediment
fills pond, terrestrial plants take over F: trees grow
A hydrosere community
A seral community is an intermediate stage found in an ecosystem advancing
towards its climax_community. In many cases more than one seral stage evolves
until climax conditions are attained.[18] A prisere is a collection of seres
making up the development of an area from non-vegetated surfaces to a climax
community. Depending on the substratum and climate, different seres are found.
***** Changes in animal life[edit] *****
Succession theory was developed primarily by botanists. The study of succession
applied to whole ecosystems initiated in the writings of Ramon_Margalef, while
Eugene_Odumâs publication of The Strategy of Ecosystem Development is
considered its formal starting point.[19]
Animal life also exhibit changes with changing communities. In lichen stage the
fauna is sparse. It comprises few mites, ants and spiders living in the cracks
and crevices. The fauna undergoes a qualitative increase during herb grass
stage. The animals found during this stage include nematodes, insects larvae,
ants, spiders, mites, etc. The animal population increases and diversifies with
the development of forest climax community. The fauna consists of invertebrates
like slugs, snails, worms, millipedes, centipedes, ants, bugs; and vertebrates
such as squirrels, foxes, mice, moles, snakes, various birds, salamanders and
frogs.
***** Microsuccession[edit] *****
Succession of micro-organisms including fungi and bacteria occurring within a
microhabitat is known as microsuccession or serule. Like in plants, microbial
succession can occur in newly available habitats (primary_succession) such as
surfaces of plant leaves, recently exposed rock surfaces (i.e., glacial till)
or animal infant guts,[14] and also on disturbed communities (secondary
succession) like those growing in recently dead trees or animal droppings.
Microbial communities may also change due to products secreted by the bacteria
present. Changes of pH in a habitat could provide ideal conditions for a new
species to inhabit the area. In some cases the new species may outcompete the
present ones for nutrients leading to the primary species demise. Changes can
also occur by microbial succession with variations in water availability and
temperature. Theories of macroecology have only recently been applied to
microbiology and so much remains to be understood about this growing field. A
recent study of microbial succession evaluated the balances between stochastic
and deterministic processes in the bacterial colonization of a salt marsh
chronosequence. The results of this study show that, much like in macro
succession, early colonization (primary_succession) is mostly influenced by
stochasticity while secondary succession of these bacterial communities was
more strongly influenced by deterministic factors.[20]
***** Climax concept[edit] *****
According to classical ecological_theory, succession stops when the sere has
arrived at an equilibrium or steady state with the physical and biotic
environment. Barring major disturbances, it will persist indefinitely. This end
point of succession is called climax.
**** Climax community[edit] ****
Main article: Climax_community
The final or stable community in a sere is the climax community or climatic
vegetation. It is self-perpetuating and in equilibrium with the physical
habitat. There is no net annual accumulation of organic matter in a climax
community. The annual production and use of energy is balanced in such a
community.
**** Characteristics[edit] ****
    * The vegetation is tolerant of environmental conditions.
    * It has a wide diversity of species, a well-drained spatial structure, and
      complex food chains.
    * The climax ecosystem is balanced. There is equilibrium between gross
      primary_production and total respiration, between energy used from
      sunlight and energy released by decomposition, between uptake of
      nutrients from the soil and the return of nutrient by litter fall to the
      soil.
    * Individuals in the climax stage are replaced by others of the same kind.
      Thus the species composition maintains equilibrium.
    * It is an index of the climate of the area. The life or growth forms
      indicate the climatic type.
**** Types of climax[edit] ****
  Climatic Climax
      If there is only a single climax and the development of climax community
      is controlled by the climate of the region, it is termed as climatic
      climax. For example, development of Maple-beech climax community over
      moist soil. Climatic climax is theoretical and develops where physical
      conditions of the substrate are not so extreme as to modify the effects
      of the prevailing regional climate.
  Edaphic Climax
      When there are more than one climax communities in the region, modified
      by local conditions of the substrate such as soil moisture, soil
      nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity, it is
      called edaphic climax. Succession ends in an edaphic climax where
      topography, soil, water, fire, or other disturbances are such that a
      climatic climax cannot develop.
  Catastrophic Climax
      Climax vegetation vulnerable to a catastrophic event such as a wildfire.
      For example, in California, chaparral vegetation is the final vegetation.
      The wildfire removes the mature vegetation and decomposers. A rapid
      development of herbaceous vegetation follows until the shrub dominance is
      re-established. This is known as catastrophic climax.
  Disclimax
      When a stable community, which is not the climatic or edaphic climax for
      the given site, is maintained by man or his domestic animals, it is
      designated as Disclimax (disturbance climax) or anthropogenic subclimax
      (man-generated). For example, overgrazing by stock may produce a desert
      community of bushes and cacti where the local climate actually would
      allow grassland to maintain itself.
  Subclimax
      The prolonged stage in succession just preceding the climatic climax is
      subclimax.
  Preclimax and Postclimax
      In certain areas different climax communities develop under similar
      climatic conditions. If the community has life forms lower than those in
      the expected climatic climax, it is called preclimax; a community that
      has life forms higher than those in the expected climatic climax is
      postclimax. Preclimax strips develop in less moist and hotter areas,
      whereas Postclimax strands develop in more moist and cooler areas than
      that of surrounding climate.
**** Theories[edit] ****
There are three schools of interpretations explaining the climax concept:
    * Monoclimax or Climatic Climax Theory was advanced by Clements (1916) and
      recognizes only one climax whose characteristics are determined solely by
      climate (climatic climax). The processes of succession and modification
      of environment overcome the effects of differences in topography, parent
      material of the soil, and other factors. The whole area would be covered
      with uniform plant community. Communities other than the climax are
      related to it, and are recognized as subclimax, postclimax and disclimax.
    * Polyclimax Theory was advanced by Tansley (1935). It proposes that the
      climax vegetation of a region consists of more than one vegetation
      climaxes controlled by soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope
      exposure, fire, and animal activity.
    * Climax Pattern Theory was proposed by Whittaker (1953). The climax
      pattern theory recognizes a variety of climaxes governed by responses of
      species populations to biotic and abiotic conditions. According to this
      theory the total environment of the ecosystem determines the composition,
      species structure, and balance of a climax community. The environment
      includes the species responses to moisture, temperature, and nutrients,
      their biotic relationships, availability of flora and fauna to colonize
      the area, chance dispersal of seeds and animals, soils, climate, and
      disturbance such as fire and wind. The nature of climax vegetation will
      change as the environment changes. The climax community represents a
      pattern of populations that corresponds to and changes with the pattern
      of environment. The central and most widespread community is the climatic
      climax.
The theory of alternative_stable_states suggests there is not one end point but
many which transition between each other over ecological time.
***** Forest succession[edit] *****
[Forest_succession_depicted_over_time.png]
The forests, being an ecological system, are subject to the species succession
process.[21] There are "opportunistic" or "pioneer" species that produce great
quantities of seed that are disseminated by the wind, and therefore can
colonize big empty extensions. They are capable of germinating and growing in
direct sunlight. Once they have produced a closed_canopy, the lack of direct
sun radiation at soil makes it difficult for their own seedlings to develop. It
is then the opportunity for shade-tolerant species to become established under
the protection of the pioneers. When the pioneers die, the shade-tolerant
species replace them. These species are capable of growing beneath the canopy,
and therefore, in the absence of catastrophes, will stay. For this reason it is
then said the stand has reached its climax. When a catastrophe occurs, the
opportunity for the pioneers opens up again, provided they are present or
within a reasonable range.
An example of pioneer species, in forests of northeastern North America are
Betula papyrifera (White_birch) and Prunus serotina (Black_cherry), that are
particularly well-adapted to exploit large gaps in forest canopies, but are
intolerant of shade and are eventually replaced by other shade-tolerant species
in the absence of disturbances that create such gaps.
Things in nature are not black and white, and there are intermediate stages. It
is therefore normal that between the two extremes of light and shade there is a
gradient, and there are species that may act as pioneer or tolerant, depending
on the circumstances. It is of paramount importance to know the tolerance of
species in order to practice an effective silviculture.
