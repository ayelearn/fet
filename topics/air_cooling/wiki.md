A Cooler_Master computer heat sink has many heatpipes.

Air cooling is a method of dissipating heat. It works by expanding the surface
area or increasing the flow of air over the object to be cooled, or both. An
example of the former is to add cooling_fins to the surface of the object,
either by making them integral or by attaching them tightly to the object's
surface (to ensure efficient heat transfer). In the case of the latter, it is
done by using a fan blowing air into or onto the object one wants to cool. The
addition of fins to a heat_sink increases its total surface area, resulting in
greater cooling effectiveness.
In all cases, the air has to be cooler than the object or surface from which it
is expected to remove heat. This is due to the second_law_of_thermodynamics,
which states that heat will only move spontaneously from a hot reservoir (the
heat sink) to a cold reservoir (the air).
***** Derating at high altitude[edit] *****
When operating in an environment with lower air pressure like high altitude or
airplane cabins, the cooling capacity has to be derated compared to that of sea
level.
A rule-of-thumb formula 1 - (h/17500) = derating factor. Where h is the height
over sea level in meters. And the result is the factor that should be
multiplied with the cooling capacity in [W] to get the cooling capacity at the
specified height over sea level.[1]
