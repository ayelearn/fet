Geomatics is defined in the ISO/TC_211 series of standards as the "discipline
concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing,
presentation of geographic_data_or_geographic_information".[1] Under another
definition it "consists of products, services and tools involved in the
collection, integration and management of geographic data".[2] It includes
geomatics engineering (and surveying_engineering) and is related to geospatial
science (also geospatial engineering and geospatial technology).

***** Overview and etymology[edit] *****
Michel Paradis, a French-Canadian surveyor, introduced geomatics as a new
scientific term in an article published in 1981 in The Canadian Surveyor and in
a keynote address at the centennial congress of the Canadian_Institute_of
Surveying in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the
needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in
history and in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a
new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new
tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.[3]
Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land_surveying, remote
sensing, cartography, geographic_information_systems (GIS), global-navigation
satellite_systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Compass), photogrammetry, geophysics,
geography, and related forms of earth mapping. The term was originally used in
Canada, because it is similar in origin to both French and English,
[clarification_needed] but has since been adopted by the International
Organization_for_Standardization, the Royal_Institution_of_Chartered_Surveyors,
and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the
United_States) have shown a preference for the term geospatial technology.[2]
[verification_needed]
The related field of hydrogeomatics covers the area associated with surveying
work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of
water. The older term of hydrographics was considered[by_whom?] too specific to
the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of
positioning or measurements in all marine environments.
A geospatial network is a network of collaborating resources for sharing and
coordinating geographical data and data tied to geographical references. One
example of such a network is the Open_Geospatial_Consortium's efforts to
provide ready global access to geographic information.[citation_needed]
A number[quantify] of university departments which were once titled
"surveying", "survey engineering" or "topographic science" have re-titled
themselves using the terms "geomatics" or "geomatic engineering".
The rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has
been made possible by advances in computer hardware, computer_science, and
software_engineering, as well as by airborne and space observation remote-
sensing technologies.
The science of deriving information about an object using a sensor without
physically contacting it is called remote sensing, which is a part of
geomatics.
***** Science [edit] *****
See also: Geographic_information_science
Geospatial science is an academic discipline incorporating fields such as
surveying, geographic_information_systems, hydrography and cartography. Spatial
science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and
display of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and
the built environment.[4]
The term spatial science or spatial sciences is primarily used in Australia.
Australian universities which offer degrees in spatial science include Curtin
University,[5] the University_of_Tasmania,[6] the University_of_Adelaide,
[7]Melbourne_University[8] and RMIT_University.[9]
In the U.S., Texas_A&M_University offers a bachelor's degree in Spatial
Sciences and is home to its own Spatial Sciences Laboratory.[10] Beginning in
2012, the University_of_Southern_California started to place more emphasis on
the spatial science branch of its geography department, with traditional human
and physical geography courses and concentrations either not being offered on a
regular basis or phased out. In place, the university now offers graduate
programs strictly related to spatial science and its geography department
offers a spatial science minor rather than the original geography major.[11]
Spatial information practitioners within the Asia-Pacific region are
represented by the professional body called the Surveying_and_Spatial_Sciences
Institute (SSSI).[12]
***** Engineering [edit] *****
 This article may need to be cleaned up. It has been merged from Geomatics
 engineering.
Geomatics Engineering, Geomatic Engineering, Geospatial Engineering is a
rapidly developing engineering discipline that focuses on spatial information
(i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used
to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization.
Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and
implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using
geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers
manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures.
Geomatics Engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software
Engineering and Civil Engineering.
Geomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field
of land surveying_engineering along with many other aspects of spatial data
management ranging from data_science and cartography to geography. Following
the advanced developments in digital data processing, the nature of the tasks
required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term "surveying"
no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that the profession deals
with. As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position
associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a
personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-
scale governmental viewpoint.
Therefore, the geomatics engineer can be involved in an extremely wide variety
of information gathering activities and applications. Geomatics engineers
design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial
information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade
features.
The more traditional land_surveying strand of geomatics engineering is
concerned with the determination and recording of boundaries and areas of real
property parcels, and the preparation and interpretation of legal land
descriptions. The tasks more closely related to civil_engineering include the
design and layout of public infrastructure and urban subdivisions, and mapping
and control surveys for construction projects.
Geomatics engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving, and
maintaining diverse spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineers utilize a
wide range of technologically advanced tools such as digital theodolite/
distance meter total stations, Global_Positioning_System (GPS) equipment,
digital aerial imagery (both satellite and air-borne), and computer-based
geographic_information_systems (GIS). These tools enable the geomatics engineer
to gather, process, analyze, visualize and manage spatially related information
to solve a wide range of technical and societal problems.
Geomatics engineering is the field of activity that integrates the acquisition,
processing, analysis, display and management of spatial information. It is an
exciting and new grouping of subjects in the spatial and environmental
information sciences with a broad range of employment opportunities as well as
offering challenging pure and applied research problems in a vast range of
interdisciplinary fields.
In different schools and in different countries the same education curriculum
is administered with the name surveying in some, and in others with the names
geomatics, civil engineering surveying, geomatics engineering, geospatial
(information) engineering, surveying engineering, or geodesy and
geoinformatics. While these occupations were at one time often taught in civil
engineering education programs, more and more universities include the
departments relevant for geo-data sciences under informatics, computer_science
or applied_mathematics. These facts demonstrate the breadth, depth and scope of
the highly interdisciplinary nature of geomatics engineering. The job of
geospatial engineer is well established in the U.S. military.[13][14]

***** Overview and etymology[edit] *****
Michel Paradis, a French-Canadian surveyor, introduced geomatics as a new
scientific term in an article published in 1981 in The Canadian Surveyor and in
a keynote address at the centennial congress of the Canadian_Institute_of
Surveying in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the
needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in
history and in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a
new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new
tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.[3]
Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land_surveying, remote
sensing, cartography, geographic_information_systems (GIS), global-navigation
satellite_systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Compass), photogrammetry, geophysics,
geography, and related forms of earth mapping. The term was originally used in
Canada, because it is similar in origin to both French and English,
[clarification_needed] but has since been adopted by the International
Organization_for_Standardization, the Royal_Institution_of_Chartered_Surveyors,
and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the
United_States) have shown a preference for the term geospatial technology.[2]
[verification_needed]
The related field of hydrogeomatics covers the area associated with surveying
work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of
water. The older term of hydrographics was considered[by_whom?] too specific to
the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of
positioning or measurements in all marine environments.
A geospatial network is a network of collaborating resources for sharing and
coordinating geographical data and data tied to geographical references. One
example of such a network is the Open_Geospatial_Consortium's efforts to
provide ready global access to geographic information.[citation_needed]
A number[quantify] of university departments which were once titled
"surveying", "survey engineering" or "topographic science" have re-titled
themselves using the terms "geomatics" or "geomatic engineering".
The rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has
been made possible by advances in computer hardware, computer_science, and
software_engineering, as well as by airborne and space observation remote-
sensing technologies.
The science of deriving information about an object using a sensor without
physically contacting it is called remote sensing, which is a part of
geomatics.
***** Science [edit] *****
See also: Geographic_information_science
Geospatial science is an academic discipline incorporating fields such as
surveying, geographic_information_systems, hydrography and cartography. Spatial
science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and
display of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and
the built environment.[4]
The term spatial science or spatial sciences is primarily used in Australia.
Australian universities which offer degrees in spatial science include Curtin
University,[5] the University_of_Tasmania,[6] the University_of_Adelaide,
[7]Melbourne_University[8] and RMIT_University.[9]
In the U.S., Texas_A&M_University offers a bachelor's degree in Spatial
Sciences and is home to its own Spatial Sciences Laboratory.[10] Beginning in
2012, the University_of_Southern_California started to place more emphasis on
the spatial science branch of its geography department, with traditional human
and physical geography courses and concentrations either not being offered on a
regular basis or phased out. In place, the university now offers graduate
programs strictly related to spatial science and its geography department
offers a spatial science minor rather than the original geography major.[11]
Spatial information practitioners within the Asia-Pacific region are
represented by the professional body called the Surveying_and_Spatial_Sciences
Institute (SSSI).[12]
***** Engineering [edit] *****
 This article may need to be cleaned up. It has been merged from Geomatics
 engineering.
Geomatics Engineering, Geomatic Engineering, Geospatial Engineering is a
rapidly developing engineering discipline that focuses on spatial information
(i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used
to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization.
Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and
implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using
geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers
manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures.
Geomatics Engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software
Engineering and Civil Engineering.
Geomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field
of land surveying_engineering along with many other aspects of spatial data
management ranging from data_science and cartography to geography. Following
the advanced developments in digital data processing, the nature of the tasks
required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term "surveying"
no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that the profession deals
with. As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position
associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a
personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-
scale governmental viewpoint.
Therefore, the geomatics engineer can be involved in an extremely wide variety
of information gathering activities and applications. Geomatics engineers
design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial
information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade
features.
The more traditional land_surveying strand of geomatics engineering is
concerned with the determination and recording of boundaries and areas of real
property parcels, and the preparation and interpretation of legal land
descriptions. The tasks more closely related to civil_engineering include the
design and layout of public infrastructure and urban subdivisions, and mapping
and control surveys for construction projects.
Geomatics engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving, and
maintaining diverse spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineers utilize a
wide range of technologically advanced tools such as digital theodolite/
distance meter total stations, Global_Positioning_System (GPS) equipment,
digital aerial imagery (both satellite and air-borne), and computer-based
geographic_information_systems (GIS). These tools enable the geomatics engineer
to gather, process, analyze, visualize and manage spatially related information
to solve a wide range of technical and societal problems.
Geomatics engineering is the field of activity that integrates the acquisition,
processing, analysis, display and management of spatial information. It is an
exciting and new grouping of subjects in the spatial and environmental
information sciences with a broad range of employment opportunities as well as
offering challenging pure and applied research problems in a vast range of
interdisciplinary fields.
In different schools and in different countries the same education curriculum
is administered with the name surveying in some, and in others with the names
geomatics, civil engineering surveying, geomatics engineering, geospatial
(information) engineering, surveying engineering, or geodesy and
geoinformatics. While these occupations were at one time often taught in civil
engineering education programs, more and more universities include the
departments relevant for geo-data sciences under informatics, computer_science
or applied_mathematics. These facts demonstrate the breadth, depth and scope of
the highly interdisciplinary nature of geomatics engineering. The job of
geospatial engineer is well established in the U.S. military.[13][14]
