Conversation in a Park by Thomas_Gainsborough, 1745
Living organisms including humans are social when they live collectively in
interacting populations, whether they are aware of it, and whether the
interaction is voluntary or involuntary.

***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word "Social" derives from the Latin word socii ("allies"). It is
particularly derived from the Italian Socii states, historical allies of the
Roman_Republic (although they rebelled against Rome in the Social_War_of_91-88
BC).
***** Definition[edit] *****
In the absence of agreement about its meaning, the term "social" is used in
many different senses and regarded as a concept, referring among other things
to:
Attitudes, orientations, or behaviors which take the interests, intentions, or
needs of other people into account (in contrast to anti-social behaviour) has
played some role in defining the idea or the principle. For instance terms like
social_realism, social_justice, social_constructivism, social_psychology,
social_anarchism and social_capital imply that there is some social process
involved or considered, a process that is not there in regular, "non-social"
realism, justice, constructivism, psychology, anarchism, or capital.
The adjective "social" is also used often in politics, although its meaning in
a context depends heavily on who is using it. In left-wing_circles it is often
used to imply a liberal characteristic, while in right-wing_circles it is
generally used to imply a conservative characteristic. This adjective is used
much more often by those on the political left than by those on the political
right. For these reasons, those seeking to avoid association with the left-
right political debates often seek to label their work with phrases that do not
include the word "social". An example is quasi-empiricism_in_mathematics which
is sometimes labelled social_constructivism by those who see it as an
unwarranted intrusion of social considerations in mathematical practice.
***** Social theorists[edit] *****
In the view of Karl_Marx[1], human beings are intrinsically, necessarily and by
definition social beings who, beyond being "gregarious creatures", cannot
survive and meet their needs other than through social co-operation and
association. Their social characteristics are therefore to a large extent an
objectively given fact, stamped on them from birth and affirmed by
socialization processes; and, according to Marx, in producing and reproducing
their material life, people must necessarily enter into relations_of_production
which are "independent of their will".
By contrast, the sociologist Max_Weber[1] for example defines human action as
"social" if, by virtue of the subjective meanings attached to the action by
individuals, it "takes account of the behavior of others, and is thereby
oriented in its course".
***** In socialism[edit] *****
The term "socialism", used from the 1830s onwards in France and the United
Kingdom, was directly related to what was called the social question. In
essence, early_socialists contended that the emergence of competitive market
societies did not create "liberty, equality and fraternity" for all citizens,
requiring the intervention of politics and social_reform to tackle social
problems, injustices and grievances (a topic on which Jean-Jacques_Rousseau
discourses at length in his classic work The_Social_Contract). Originally the
term "socialist" was often used interchangeably with "co-operative",
"mutualist", "associationist" and "collectivist" in reference to the
organization of economic enterprise socialists advocated, in contrast to the
private_enterprise and corporate organizational structures inherent to
capitalism.
The modern concept of socialism evolved in response to the development of
industrial capitalism. The "social" in modern "socialism" came to refer to the
specific perspective and understanding socialists had of the development of
material, economic forces and determinants of human behavior in society.
Specifically, it denoted the perspective that human_behavior is largely
determined by a person's immediate social_environment, that modes of social
organization were not supernatural or metaphysical constructs but products of
the social system and social environment, which were in turn products of the
level of technology/mode of production (the material world), and were therefore
constantly changing. Social and economic systems were thus not the product of
innate human nature, but of the underlying form of economic organization and
level of technology in a given society, implying that human social relations
and incentive-structures would also change as social relations and social
organization changes in response to improvements in technology and evolving
material forces (relations_of_production). This perspective formed the bulk of
the foundation for Karl Marx's materialist_conception_of_history.
***** Modern uses[edit] *****
In contemporary society, "social" often refers to the redistributive policies
of the government which aim to apply resources in the public_interest, for
example, [social security]. Policy concerns then include the problems of social
exclusion and social_cohesion. Here, "social" contrasts with "private" and to
the distinction between the public and the private (or privatised) spheres,
where ownership relations define access to resources and attention.
The social domain is often also contrasted with that of physical nature, but in
sociobiology analogies are drawn between humans and other living species in
order to explain social_behavior in terms of biological factors.
