****** Slope stability ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Slope stability refers to the condition of inclined soil or rock slopes to
withstand or undergo movement. The stability condition of slopes is a subject
of study and research in soil_mechanics, geotechnical_engineering and
engineering_geology. Slope_stability_analyses include static and dynamic,
analytical or empirical methods to evaluate the stability of earth and rock-
fill dams, embankments, excavated slopes, and natural slopes in soil and rock.
The analyses are generally aimed at understanding the causes of an occurred
slope failure, or the factors that can potentially trigger a slope movement,
resulting in a landslide, as well as at preventing the initiation of such
movement, slowing it down or arresting it through mitigation countermeasures.
The stability of a slope is essentially controlled by the ratio between the
available shear_strength and the acting shear_stress, which can be expressed in
terms of a safety_factor if these quantities are integrated over a potential
(or actual) sliding surface. A slope can be globally stable if the safety
factor, computed along any potential sliding surface running from the top of
the slope to its toe, is always larger than 1. The smallest value of the safety
factor will be taken as representing the global stability condition of the
slope. Similarly, a slope can be locally stable if a safety factor larger than
1 is computed along any potential sliding surface running through a limited
portion of the slope (for instance only within its toe). Values of the global
or local safety factors close to 1 (typically comprised between 1 and 1.3,
depending on regulations) indicate marginally stable slopes that require
attention, monitoring and/or an engineering intervention (slope_stabilization)
to increase the safety factor and reduce the probability of a slope movement.
A previously stable slope can be affected by a number of predisposing factors
or processes that make the safety factor decrease - either by increasing the
shear stress or by decreasing the shear strength - and can ultimately result in
slope failure. Factors that can trigger slope failure include hydrologic events
(such as intense or prolonged rainfall, rapid snowmelt, progressive soil
saturation, increase of water pressure within the slope), earthquakes
(including aftershocks), internal erosion (piping), surface or toe erosion,
artificial slope loading (for instance due to the construction of a building),
slope cutting (for instance to make space for roadways, railways or buildings),
or slope flooding (for instance by filling an artificial_lake after damming a
river).

***** Examples[edit] *****

Figure 1: Simple slope slip section
As seen in Figure 1, earthen slopes can develop a cut-spherical weakness area.
The probability of this happening can be calculated in advance using a simple
2-D circular analysis package.[1] A primary difficulty with analysis is
locating the most-probable slip plane for any given situation.[2] Many
landslides have only been analyzed after the fact. More recently slope
stability_radar technology has been employed, particularly in the mining
industry, to gather real time data and assist in determining the likelihood of
slope failure.
Figure 2: Real life landslide on a slope
Real life failures in naturally deposited mixed soils are not necessarily
circular, but prior to computers, it was far easier to analyse such a
simplified geometry. Nevertheless, failures in 'pure' clay can be quite close
to circular. Such slips often occur after a period of heavy rain, when the pore
water pressure at the slip surface increases, reducing the effective normal
stress and thus diminishing the restraining friction along the slip line. This
is combined with increased soil weight due to the added groundwater. A
'shrinkage' crack (formed during prior dry weather) at the top of the slip may
also fill with rain water, pushing the slip forward. At the other extreme,
slab-shaped slips on hillsides can remove a layer of soil from the top of the
underlying bedrock. Again, this is usually initiated by heavy rain, sometimes
combined with increased loading from new buildings or removal of support at the
toe (resulting from road widening or other construction work). Stability can
thus be significantly improved by installing drainage paths to reduce the
destabilising forces. Once the slip has occurred, however, a weakness along the
slip circle remains, which may then recur at the next monsoon.There are many
more methods are also available
Slope stability issues can be seen with almost any walk down a ravine in an
urban setting. An example is shown in Figure 3, where a river is eroding the
toe of a slope, and there is a swimming pool near the top of the slope. If the
toe is eroded too far, or the swimming pool begins to leak, the forces driving
a slope failure will exceed those resisting failure, and a landslide will
develop, possibly quite suddenly.
***** Analysis methods[edit] *****
Main article: Slope_stability_analysis
Figure 3: Slope with eroding river and swimming pool
Figure 4: Method of slices
If the forces available to resist movement are greater than the forces driving
movement, the slope is considered stable. A factor_of_safety is calculated by
dividing the forces resisting movement by the forces driving movement. In
earthquake-prone areas, the analysis is typically run for static conditions and
pseudo-static conditions, where the seismic forces from an earthquake are
assumed to add static loads to the analysis.

Stability of slopes can be improved by:
    * Flattening of slope results in reduction in weight which makes the slope
      more stable
    * Soil stabilization
    * Providing lateral supports by piles or retaining walls
    * Grouting or cement injections into special places
    * Consolidation by surcharging or electro osmosis increases the stability
      of slope.
