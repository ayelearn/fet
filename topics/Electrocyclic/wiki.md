****** Electrocyclic reaction ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In organic_chemistry, an electrocyclic reaction is a type of pericyclic
rearrangement where the net result is one pi_bond being converted into one
sigma_bond or vice versa.[1] These reactions are usually categorized by the
following criteria:
    * Reactions can be either photochemical or thermal.
    * Reactions can be either ring-opening or ring-closing
      (electrocyclization).
    * Depending on the type of reaction (photochemical or thermal) and the
      number of pi electrons, the reaction can happen through either a
      conrotatory_or_disrotatory mechanism.
    * The type of rotation determines whether the cis_or_trans isomer of the
      product will be formed.

***** Classical examples[edit] *****
The Nazarov_cyclization_reaction is a named electrocyclic reaction converting
divinylketones to cyclopentenones.
A classic example is the thermal ring-opening_reaction of 3,4-
dimethylcyclobutene. The cis_isomer exclusively yields cis,trans-hexa-2,4-diene
whereas the trans isomer gives the trans,trans diene:[2]
[Dimethylcyclobutene_isomerization]
This reaction course can be explained in a simple analysis through the
frontier-orbital_method: the sigma bond in the reactant will open in such a way
that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same symmetry as the HOMO of the
product (a hexadiene). The only way to accomplish this is through a conrotatory
ring-opening which results in opposite signs for the terminal lobes.
[Dimethylcyclobutene_ringopening_mechanism_frontier-orbital_method]
***** Stereospecificity of electrocyclic reactions[edit] *****
When performing an electrocyclic reaction, it is often desirable to predict the
cis/trans_geometry of the reaction's product. The first step in this process is
to determine whether a reaction proceeds through conrotation_or_disrotation.
The table below shows the selectivity rules for thermal and photochemical
electrocyclic reactions.
 ________________________________________________________________________
|System               |Thermally induced (ground|Photochemically induced |
|_____________________|state)___________________|(excited_state)_________|
|Even_#_of_conjugation|Conrotatory______________|Disrotatory_____________|
|Odd_#_of_conjugation_|Disrotatory______________|Conrotatory_____________|
For the example given below, the thermal reaction of (trans,cis,trans)-octa-
2,4,6-triene will happen through a disrotatory mechanism. After determining the
type of rotation, whether the product will be cis or trans can be determined by
examining the starting molecule. In the example below, the disrotation causes
both methyls to point upwards, causing the product to be cis-
dimethylcyclohexadiene.
In addition, the torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the
direction of rotation. For example, a reaction that is conrotatory can still
rotate in two directions, producing enantiomeric products. A reaction that is
torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation (partially or
completely) to produce a product in enantiomeric_excess.

***** Mechanism of thermal reactions[edit] *****
**** Woodward-Hoffman rules[edit] ****
[Correlation1.jpg]
Correlation diagrams, which connect the molecular orbitals of the reactant to
those of the product having the same symmetry, can then be constructed for the
two processes.[3]
[Correlation2.jpg]
These correlation diagrams indicate that only a conrotatory ring opening of
3,4-dimethylcyclobutene is symmetry allowed whereas only a disrotatory ring
opening of 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene is symmetry allowed. This is because
only in these cases would maximum orbital overlap occur in the transition
state. Also, the formed product would be in a ground state rather than an
excited state.
**** Frontier molecular orbital theory[edit] ****
According to the frontier molecular orbital theory, the sigma bond in the ring
will open in such a way that the resulting p-orbitals will have the same
symmetry as the HOMO of the product.[4]
[FMOT1.jpg]
For the 5,6-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene, only a disrotatory mode would result
in p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of hexatriene. For the 3,4-
dimethylcyclobutene, on the other hand, only a conrotatory mode would result in
p-orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of butadiene.
***** Mechanism of photochemical reactions[edit] *****
If the ring opening of 3,4-dimethylcyclobutene were carried out under
photochemical conditions the resulting electrocyclization would be occur
through a disrotatory mode instead of a conrotatory mode as can be seen by the
correlation diagram for the allowed excited state ring opening reaction.
[4pi_photochemical_correlation_diagram.png]
Only a disrotatory mode, in which symmetry about a reflection plane is
maintained throughout the reaction, would result in maximum orbital overlap in
the transition state. Also, once again, this would result in the formation of a
product that is in an excited state of comparable stability to the excited
state of the reactant compound.
***** Electrocyclic reactions in biological systems[edit] *****
Electrocyclic reactions occur frequently in nature.[5] One of the most common
such electrocyclizations is the biosynthesis of vitamin_D3.
[Vitamin_D3_synthesis.svg]
The first step involves a photochemically induced conrotatory ring opening of
7-dehydrocholesterol to form pre vitamin D3. A [1,7]-hydride shift then forms
vitamin D3.
Another example is in the proposed biosynthesis of aranotin, a naturally
occurring oxepine, and its related compounds.
[Aranotin_ring_formation.svg]
Enzymatic epoxidation of phenylalanine-derived diketopiperazine forms the arene
oxide, which undergoes a 6Ï disrotatory ring opening electrocyclization
reaction to produce the uncyclized oxepine. After a second epoxidation of the
ring, the nearby nucleophilic nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbon,
forming a five membered ring. The resulting ring system is a common ring system
found in aranotin and its related compounds.
The benzonorcaradiene diterpenoid (A) was rearranged into the
benzocycloheptatriene diterpenoid isosalvipuberlin (B) by boiling a methylene
chloride solution. This transformation can be envisaged as a disrotatory
electrocyclic reaction, followed by two suprafacial 1,5-sigmatropic hydrogen
shifts, as shown below.[6]
[Isosalvipuberlin2.jpg]
***** Electrocyclic reactions in organic synthesis[edit] *****
An often studied electrocyclic reaction is the conrotatory thermal ring-opening
of benzocyclobutene. The reaction product is a very unstable ortho-
quinodimethane but this molecule can be trapped in an endo_addition with a
strong dienophile such as maleic_anhydride to the Diels-Alder adduct. The
chemical_yield for the ring opening of the benzocyclobutane depicted in scheme
2 is found to depend on the nature of the substituent R.[7] With a reaction
solvent such as toluene and a reaction temperature of 110 Â°C, the yield
increases going from methyl to isobutylmethyl to trimethylsilylmethyl. The
increased reaction_rate for the trimethylsilyl compound can be explained by
silicon_hyperconjugation as the Î²C-Si bond weakens the cyclobutane C-C bond by
donating electrons.
[Scheme_2._benzocyclobutane_ring_opening]
A biomimetic electrocyclic cascade_reaction was discovered in relation to the
isolation and synthesis of certain endiandric acids:[8][9]
[Electrocyclization_in_endrianic_acids_synthesis]
Asymmetric electrocyclic reactions are an emerging field in contemporary
organic synthesis. The most commonly studied reactions in this field are the
4Ï Staudinger Î²-lactam synthesis[10] and the 4Ï Nazarov_reaction; asymmetric
catalysis of both reactions have been controlled by use of a chiral_auxiliary,
and the Nazarov reaction has been performed catalytically using chiral Lewis
acids, BrÃ¸nsted_acids and chiral amines.[11]
