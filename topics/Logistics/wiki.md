Management of the flow of resources
For other uses, see Logistics_(disambiguation).
Logistics is generally the detailed organization and implementation of a
complex operation. In a general business sense, logistics is the management of
the flow of things between the point of origin and the point of consumption in
order to meet requirements of customers or corporations. The resources managed
in logistics may include tangible goods such as materials, equipment, and
supplies, as well as food and other consumable items. The logistics of physical
items usually involves the integration of information flow, materials_handling,
production, packaging, inventory, transportation, warehousing, and often
security.
In military science, logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply lines
while disrupting those of the enemy, since an armed force without resources and
transportation is defenseless. Military logistics was already practiced in the
ancient_world and as modern military have a significant need for logistics
solutions, advanced implementations have been developed. In military logistics,
logistics officers manage how and when to move resources to the places they are
needed.
Logistics management is the part of supply_chain_management that plans,
implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward, and reverse flow and
storage of goods, services, and related information between the point_of_origin
and the point_of_consumption in order to meet customer's requirements. The
complexity of logistics can be modeled, analyzed, visualized, and optimized by
dedicated simulation_software. The minimization of the use of resources is a
common motivation in all logistics fields. A professional working in the field
of logistics management is called a logistician.
Configuring and managing warehouses is a central concern for both business
logistics and military_logistics.

***** Nomenclature[edit] *****
The term logistics is attested in English from 1846, and is from French:
logistique, where it was either coined or popularized by military officer and
writer Antoine-Henri_Jomini, who defined it in his Summary of the Art of War
(PrÃ©cis de l'Art de la Guerre). The term appears in the 1830 edition, then
titled Analytic Table (Tableau Analytique),[1] and Jomini explains that it is
derived from French: logis, lit. 'lodgings' (cognate to English lodge), in the
terms French: marÃ©chal_des_logis, lit. 'marshall of lodgings' and French:
major-gÃ©nÃ©ral des logis, lit. 'major-general of lodging':
     Autrefois les officiers de lâÃ©tat-major se nommaient: marÃ©chal
     des logis, major-gÃ©nÃ©ral des logis; de lÃ  est venu le terme de
     logistique, quâon emploie pour dÃ©signer ce qui se rapporte aux
     marches dâune armÃ©e.
     Formerly the officers of the general staff were named: marshall of
     lodgings, major-general of lodgings; from there came the term of
     logistics [logistique], which we employ to designate those who are in
     charge of the functionings of an army.
The term is credited to Jomini, and the term and its etymology criticized by
Georges_de_Chambray in 1832, writing:[2]
     Logistique: Ce mot me paraÃ®t Ãªtre tout-Ã -fait nouveau, car je ne
     l'avais encore vu nulle part dans la littÃ©rature militaire. â¦ il
     paraÃ®t le faire dÃ©river du mot logis, Ã©tymologie singuliÃ¨re â¦
     Logistic: This word appears to me to be completely new, as I have not
     yet see it anywhere in military literature. â¦ he appears to derive
     it from the word lodgings [logis], a peculiar etymology â¦
Chambray also notes that the term logistique was present in the Dictionnaire_de
l'AcadÃ©mie_franÃ§aise as a synonym for algebra.
The French word: logistique is a homonym of the existing mathematical term,
from Ancient_Greek: Î»Î¿Î³á¿ÏÏá¿ÎºÏÏ, romanized: logistikÃ³s, a
traditional division of Greek_mathematics; the mathematical term is presumably
the origin of the term logistic in logistic_growth and related terms. Some
sources give this instead as the source of logistics,[3] either ignorant of
Jomini's statement that it was derived from logis, or dubious and instead
believing it was in fact of Greek origin, or influenced by the existing term of
Greek origin.
***** Definition[edit] *****
Jomini originally defined logistics as:[1]
     ... l'art de bien ordonner les marches d'une armÃ©e, de bien combiner
     l'ordre des troupes dans les colonnes, les tems [temps] de leur
     dÃ©part, leur itinÃ©raire, les moyens de communications nÃ©cessaires
     pour assurer leur arrivÃ©e Ã  point nommÃ© ...
     ... the art of well ordering the functionings of an army, of well
     combining the order of troops in columns, the times of their
     departure, their itinerary, the means of communication necessary to
     assure their arrival at a named point ...
The Oxford_English_Dictionary defines logistics as "the branch of military
science relating to procuring, maintaining and transporting material, personnel
and facilities". However, the New_Oxford_American_Dictionary defines logistics
as "the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving many people,
facilities, or supplies", and the Oxford Dictionary on-line defines it as "the
detailed organization and implementation of a complex operation".[4] As such,
logistics is commonly seen as a branch of engineering that creates "people
systems" rather than "machine systems".
According to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (previously
the Council of Logistics Management),[5] logistics is the process of planning,
implementing and controlling procedures for the efficient and effective
transportation and storage of goods including services and related information
from the point of origin to the point of consumption for the purpose of
conforming to customer requirements and includes inbound, outbound, internal
and external movements.[6]
Academics and practitioners traditionally refer to the terms operations or
production management when referring to physical transformations taking place
in a single business location (factory, restaurant or even bank clerking) and
reserve the term logistics for activities related to distribution, that is,
moving products on the territory. Managing a distribution center is seen,
therefore, as pertaining to the realm of logistics since, while in theory the
products made by a factory are ready for consumption they still need to be
moved along the distribution network according to some logic, and the
distribution center aggregates and processes orders coming from different areas
of the territory. That being said, from a modeling perspective, there are
similarities between operations_management and logistics, and companies
sometimes use hybrid professionals, with for example a "Director of Operations"
or a "Logistics Officer" working on similar problems. Furthermore, the term
supply_chain_management originally refers to, among other issues, having an
integrated vision of both production and logistics from point of origin to
point of production.[7] All these terms may suffer from semantic_change as a
side effect of advertising.

Inbound logistics is one of the primary processes of logistics concentrating on
purchasing and arranging the inbound movement of materials, parts, or
unfinished inventory from suppliers to manufacturing or assembly plants,
warehouses, or retail stores.
Outbound logistics is the process related to the storage and movement of the
final product and the related information flows from the end of the production
line to the end user.
Given the services performed by logisticians, the main fields of logistics can
be broken down as follows:
    * Procurement logistics
    * Distribution logistics
    * After-sales logistics
    * Disposal logistics
    * Reverse_logistics
    * Green_logistics
    * Global logistics
    * Domestics logistics
    * Concierge Service
    * RAM logistics
    * Asset Control Logistics
    * POS Material Logistics
    * Emergency Logistics
    * Production Logistics
    * Construction Logistics
    * Capital Project Logistics
    * Digital Logistics

manufacturing plant
Procurement logistics consists of activities such as market_research,
requirements planning, make-or-buy decisions, supplier management, ordering,
and order controlling. The targets in procurement logistics might be
contradictory: maximizing efficiency by concentrating on core competences,
outsourcing while maintaining the autonomy of the company, or minimizing
procurement costs while maximizing security within the supply process.
Advance Logistics consists of the activities required to set up or establish a
plan for logistics activities to occur.
Distribution logistics has, as main tasks, the delivery of the finished
products to the customer. It consists of order processing, warehousing, and
transportation. Distribution logistics is necessary because the time, place,
and quantity of production differs with the time, place, and quantity of
consumption.
Disposal logistics has as its main function to reduce logistics cost(s) and
enhance service(s) related to the disposal of waste produced during the
operation of a business.
Reverse logistics denotes all those operations related to the reuse of products
and materials. The reverse logistics process includes the management and the
sale of surpluses, as well as products being returned to vendors from buyers.
Reverse logistics stands for all operations related to the reuse of products
and materials. It is "the process of planning, implementing, and controlling
the efficient, cost effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory,
finished goods and related information from the point of consumption to the
point of origin for the purpose of recapturing value or proper disposal. More
precisely, reverse logistics is the process of moving goods from their typical
final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal. The
opposite of reverse logistics is forward logistics."
Green Logistics describes all attempts to measure and minimize the ecological
impact of logistics activities. This includes all activities of the forward and
reverse flows. This can be achieved through intermodal_freight_transport, path
optimization, vehicle saturation and city_logistics.
RAM Logistics (see also Logistic_engineering) combines both business logistics
and military logistics since it is concerned with highly complicated
technological systems for which Reliability, Availability and Maintainability
are essential, ex: weapon_systems and military supercomputers.
Asset Control Logistics: companies in the retail channels, both organized
retailers and suppliers, often deploy assets required for the display,
preservation, promotion of their products. Some examples are refrigerators,
stands, display monitors, seasonal equipment, poster stands & frames.

aircraft, following devastating_floods in the country in 2010.
Emergency_logistics (or Humanitarian_Logistics) is a term used by the
logistics, supply chain, and manufacturing industries to denote specific time-
critical modes of transport used to move goods or objects rapidly in the event
of an emergency.[8] The reason for enlisting emergency logistics services could
be a production delay or anticipated production delay, or an urgent need for
specialized equipment to prevent events such as aircraft being grounded (also
known as "aircraft_on_ground"âAOG), ships being delayed, or
telecommunications failure. Humanitarian logistics involves governments, the
military, aid_agencies, donors, non-governmental_organizations and emergency
logistics services are typically sourced from a specialist provider.[8][9]
The term production logistics describes logistic processes within a value
adding system (ex: factory or a mine). Production logistics aims to ensure that
each machine and workstation receives the right product in the right quantity
and quality at the right time. The concern is with production, testing,
transportation, storage and supply. Production logistics can operate in
existing as well as new plants: since manufacturing in an existing plant is a
constantly changing process, machines are exchanged and new ones added, which
gives the opportunity to improve the production logistics system accordingly.
[10] Production logistics provides the means to achieve customer response and
capital efficiency. Production logistics becomes more important with decreasing
batch sizes. In many industries (e.g. mobile_phones), the short-term goal is a
batch size of one, allowing even a single customer's demand to be fulfilled
efficiently. Track_and_tracing, which is an essential part of production
logistics due to product safety and reliability issues, is also gaining
importance, especially in the automotive and medical industries.
Construction Logistics is known to mankind since ancient times. As the various
human civilizations tried to build the best possible works of construction for
living and protection. Now the construction logistics emerged as vital part of
construction. In the past few years construction logistics has emerged as a
different field of knowledge and study within the subject of supply chain
management and logistics.
Digital logistics is driven by a new generation of web-based, enterprise
logistics applications that enable collaboration and optimization, leveraging a
central logistics information backbone that provides visibility across the
enterprise and extended supply chain.
***** Military logistics[edit] *****
Main article: Military_logistics
Punjab Regiment uses mules for carrying cargo in Burma during WWII. Animals
have been used for logistic purposes by different people throughout history;
the Roman army in particular preferred mules over donkeys for their moving
capacity.[11]
In military science, maintaining one's supply lines while disrupting those of
the enemy is a crucialâsome would say the most crucialâelement of military
strategy, since an armed force without resources and transportation is
defenseless. The historical leaders Hannibal, Alexander_the_Great, and the Duke
of_Wellington are considered to have been logistical geniuses: Alexander's
expedition benefited considerably from his meticulous attention to the
provisioning of his army,[12] Hannibal is credited to have "taught logistics"
to the Romans during the Punic_Wars [13] and the success of the Anglo-
Portuguese army in the Peninsula_War was the due to the effectiveness of
Wellington's supply system, despite the numerical disadvantage.[14] The defeat
of the British in the American_War_of_Independence and the defeat of the Axis
in the African_theater of World_War_II are attributed by some scholars to
logistical failures.[15]
Militaries have a significant need for logistics solutions and so have
developed advanced implementations. Integrated_Logistics_Support (ILS) is a
discipline used in military industries to ensure an easily supportable system
with a robust customer service (logistic) concept at the lowest cost and in
line with (often high) reliability, availability, maintainability, and other
requirements, as defined for the project.
In military_logistics, logistics_officers manage how and when to move resources
to the places they are needed.
Supply_chain_management in military logistics often deals with a number of
variables in predicting cost, deterioration, consumption, and future demand.
The United_States_Armed_Forces' categorical supply_classification was developed
in such a way that categories of supply with similar consumption variables are
grouped together for planning purposes. For instance, peacetime consumption of
ammunition and fuel will be considerably lower than wartime consumption of
these items, whereas other classes of supply such as subsistence and clothing
have a relatively consistent consumption rate regardless of war or peace.
Some classes of supply have a linear demand relationship: as more troops are
added, more supply items are needed; or as more equipment is used, more fuel
and ammunition are consumed. Other classes of supply must consider a third
variable besides usage and quantity: time. As equipment ages, more and more
repair_parts are needed over time, even when usage and quantity stays
consistent. By recording and analyzing these trends over time and applying them
to future scenarios, the US Armed Forces can accurately supply troops with the
items necessary at the precise moment they are needed.[16] History has shown
that good logistical planning creates a lean and efficient fighting force. The
lack thereof can lead to a clunky, slow, and ill-equipped force with too much
or too little supply.
***** Business logistics[edit] *****

One definition of business logistics speaks of "having the right item in the
right quantity at the right time at the right place for the right price in the
right condition to the right customer".[17] Business logistics incorporates all
industry_sectors and aims to manage the fruition of project_life_cycles, supply
chains, and resultant efficiencies.
The term "business logistics" has evolved since the 1960s[18] due to the
increasing complexity of supplying businesses with materials and shipping out
products in an increasingly globalized supply chain, leading to a call for
professionals called "supply chain logisticians".
In business, logistics may have either an internal focus (inbound logistics) or
an external focus (outbound logistics), covering the flow and storage of
materials from point of origin to point of consumption (see supply-chain
management). The main functions of a qualified logistician include inventory
management, purchasing, transportation, warehousing, consultation, and the
organizing and planning of these activities. Logisticians combine a
professional knowledge of each of these functions to coordinate resources in an
organization.
There are two fundamentally different forms of logistics: one optimizes a
steady flow of material through a network of transport links and storage nodes,
while the other coordinates a sequence of resources to carry out some project
(e.g., restructuring a warehouse).
**** Nodes of a distribution network[edit] ****
The nodes of a distribution network include:
    * Factories where products are manufactured or assembled
    * A depot or deposit, a standard type of warehouse for storing merchandise
      (high level of inventory)
    * Distribution_centers for order_processing and order_fulfillment (lower
      level of inventory) and also for receiving returning items from clients
    * Transit points for cross_docking activities, which consist of
      reassembling cargo units based on deliveries scheduled (only moving
      merchandise)
    * Traditional retail stores of the Mom_and_Pop variety, modern
      supermarkets, hypermarkets, discount_stores or also voluntary chains,
      consumers'_co-operative, groups of consumer with collective_buying_power.
      Note that subsidiaries will be mostly owned by another company and
      franchisers, although using other company brands, actually own the point
      of sale.
There may be some intermediaries operating for representative matters between
nodes such as sales_agents or brokers.
**** Logistic families and metrics[edit] ****
A logistic family is a set of products which share a common characteristic:
weight and volumetric characteristics, physical storing needs (temperature,
radiation,...), handling needs, order frequency, package size, etc. The
following metrics may be used by the company to organize its products in
different families:[19]
    * Physical metrics used to evaluate inventory systems include stocking
      capacity, selectivity, superficial utilization, volumetric utilization,
      transport capacity, transport capacity utilization.
    * Monetary metrics used include space holding costs (building, shelving and
      services) and handling costs (people, handling machinery, energy and
      maintenance).
Other metrics may present themselves in both physical or monetary form, such as
the standard Inventory_turnover.
**** Handling and order processing[edit] ****
Unit_loads for transportation of luggage at the airport. In this case the unit
load has protective function.
Unit_loads are combinations of individual items which are moved by handling
systems, usually employing a pallet of normed dimensions.[20]
Handling systems include: trans-pallet handlers, counterweight handler,
retractable mast handler, bilateral handlers, trilateral handlers, AGV and
handlers. Storage systems include: pile stocking, cell racks (either static or
movable), cantilever racks and gravity racks.[21]
Order_processing is a sequential process involving: processing withdrawal list,
picking (selective removal of items from loading units), sorting (assembling
items based on destination), package formation (weighting, labeling and
packing), order consolidation (gathering packages into loading units for
transportation, control and bill_of_lading).[22]
Picking can be both manual or automated. Manual picking can be both man to
goods, i.e. operator using a cart or conveyor belt, or goods to man, i.e. the
operator benefiting from the presence of a mini-load ASRS, vertical or
horizontal_carousel or from an Automatic Vertical Storage System (AVSS).
Automatic picking is done either with dispensers or depalletizing robots.
Sorting can be done manually through carts or conveyor belts, or automatically
through sorters.
**** Transportation[edit] ****
Main article: Cargo
Cargo, i.e. merchandise being transported, can be moved through a variety of
transportation means and is organized in different shipment_categories. Unit
loads are usually assembled into higher standardized units such as: ISO
containers, swap_bodies or semi-trailers. Especially for very long distances,
product transportation will likely benefit from using different transportation
means: multimodal_transport, intermodal_transport (no handling) and combined
transport (minimal road transport). When moving cargo, typical constraints are
maximum weight and volume.
Operators involved in transportation include: all train, road vehicles, boats,
airplanes companies, couriers, freight_forwarders and multi-modal_transport
operators.
Merchandise being transported internationally is usually subject to the
Incoterms standards issued by the International_Chamber_of_Commerce.
**** Configuration and management[edit] ****
Push-back rack for motorcycles, a LIFO rack system for storage
Similarly to production systems, logistic systems need to be properly
configured and managed. Actually a number of methodologies have been directly
borrowed from operations_management such as using Economic_Order_Quantity
models for managing inventory in the nodes of the network.[23] Distribution
resource_planning (DRP) is similar to MRP, except that it doesn't concern
activities inside the nodes of the network but planning distribution when
moving goods through the links of the network.
Traditionally in logistics configuration may be at the level of the warehouse
(node) or at level of the distribution system (network).
Regarding a single warehouse, besides the issue of designing and building the
warehouse, configuration means solving a number of interrelated technical-
economic problems: dimensioning rack cells, choosing a palletizing method
(manual or through robots), rack dimensioning and design, number of racks,
number and typology of retrieval systems (e.g. stacker_cranes). Some important
constraints have to be satisfied: fork and load beams resistance to bending and
proper placement of sprinklers. Although picking is more of a tactical planning
decision than a configuration problem, it is important to take it into account
when deciding the racks layout inside the warehouse and buying tools such as
handlers and motorized carts since once those decisions are taken they will
work as constraints when managing the warehouse, same reasoning for sorting
when designing the conveyor system or installing automatic dispensers.
Configuration at the level of the distribution system concerns primarily the
problem of location of the nodes in a geographic space and distribution of
capacity among the nodes. The first may be referred to as facility_location
(with the special case of site_selection) while the latter to as capacity
allocation. The problem of outsourcing typically arises at this level: the
nodes of a supply_chain are very rarely owned by a single enterprise.
Distribution networks can be characterized by numbers of levels, namely the
number of intermediary nodes between supplier and consumer:
    * Direct_store_delivery, i.e. zero levels
    * One level network: central warehouse
    * Two level network: central and peripheral warehouses
This distinction is more useful for modeling purposes, but it relates also to a
tactical decision regarding safety_stocks: considering a two level network, if
safety inventory is kept only in peripheral warehouses then it is called a
dependent system (from suppliers), if safety inventory is distributed among
central and peripheral warehouses it is called an independent system (from
suppliers).[19] Transportation from producer to the second level is called
primary transportation, from the second level to consumer is called secondary
transportation.
Although configuring a distribution network from zero is possible, logisticians
usually have to deal with restructuring existing networks due to presence of an
array of factors: changing demand, product or process innovation, opportunities
for outsourcing, change of government policy toward trade_barriers, innovation
in transportation means (both vehicles or thoroughfares), introduction of
regulations (notably those regarding pollution) and availability of ICT
supporting systems (e.g. ERP or e-commerce).
Once a logistic system is configured, management, meaning tactical decisions,
takes place, once again, at the level of the warehouse and of the distribution
network. Decisions have to be made under a set of constraints: internal, such
as using the available infrastructure, or external, such as complying with
given product shelf_lifes and expiration_dates.
At the warehouse level, the logistician must decide how to distribute
merchandise over the racks. Three basic situations are traditionally
considered: shared storage, dedicated storage (rack space reserved for specific
merchandise) and class based storage (class meaning merchandise organized in
different areas according to their access index).
Airline logistic network. Denver works as a hub in the network.
Picking efficiency varies greatly depending on the situation.[22] For man to
goods situation, a distinction is carried out between high level picking
(vertical component significant) and low level picking (vertical component
insignificant). A number of tactical decisions regarding picking must be made:
    * Routing path: standard alternatives include transversal routing, return
      routing, midpoint routing and largest gap return routing
    * Replenishment method: standard alternatives include equal space supply
      for each product class and equal time supply for each product class.
    * Picking logic: order picking vs batch picking
At the level of the distribution network, tactical decisions involve mainly
inventory_control and delivery path optimization. Note that the logistician may
be required to manage the reverse_flow along with the forward flow.
**** Warehouse management and control[edit] ****
Although there is some overlap in functionality, warehouse_management_systems
(WMS) can differ significantly from warehouse_control_systems (WCS). Simply
put, a WMS plans a weekly activity forecast based on such factors as statistics
and trends, whereas a WCS acts like a floor supervisor, working in real time to
get the job done by the most effective means. For instance, a WMS can tell the
system that it is going to need five of stock-keeping_unit (SKU) A and five of
SKU B hours in advance, but by the time it acts, other considerations may have
come into play or there could be a logjam on a conveyor. A WCS can prevent that
problem by working in real time and adapting to the situation by making a last-
minute decision based on current activity and operational status. Working
synergistically, WMS and WCS can resolve these issues and maximize efficiency
for companies that rely on the effective operation of their warehouse or
distribution center.[24]
**** Logistics outsourcing[edit] ****
Logistics outsourcing involves a relationship between a company and an LSP
(logistic service provider), which, compared with basic logistics services, has
more customized offerings, encompasses a broad number of service activities, is
characterized by a long-term orientation, and thus has a strategic nature.[25]
Outsourcing does not have to be complete externalization to an LSP, but can
also be partial:
    * A single contract for supplying a specific service on occasion
    * Creation of a spin-off
    * Creation of a joint_venture
Third-party_logistics (3PL) involves using external organizations to execute
logistics activities that have traditionally been performed within an
organization itself.[26] According to this definition, third-party logistics
includes any form of outsourcing of logistics activities previously performed
in house. For example, if a company with its own warehousing facilities decides
to employ external transportation, this would be an example of third-party
logistics. Logistics is an emerging business area in many countries.
The concept of a fourth-party logistics (4PL) provider was first defined by
Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) as an integrator that assembles the
resources, planning capabilities, and technology of its own organization and
other organizations to design, build, and run comprehensive supply chain
solutions. Whereas a third-party logistics (3PL) service provider targets a
single function, a 4PL targets management of the entire process. Some have
described a 4PL as a general contractor that manages other 3PLs, truckers,
forwarders, custom house agents, and others, essentially taking responsibility
of a complete process for the customer.
**** Horizontal alliances between logistics service providers[edit] ****
Horizontal business_alliances often occur between logistics service providers,
i.e., the cooperation between two or more logistics companies that are
potentially competing.[27] In a horizontal alliance, these partners can benefit
twofold. On one hand, they can " resources which are directly exploitable". In
this example extending common transportation networks, their warehouse
infrastructure and the ability to provide more complex service packages can be
achieved by combining resources. On the other hand, partners can "access
intangible resources, which are not directly exploitable". This typically
includes know-how and information and, in turn, innovation.[27]
***** Logistics automation[edit] *****
Main article: Logistics_automation
Automated_storage_and_retrieval_system used by the U.S. military, also used by
business in conjunction with manual picking.
Logistics_automation is the application of computer_software or automated
machinery to improve the efficiency of logistics operations. Typically this
refers to operations within a warehouse or distribution center with broader
tasks undertaken by supply_chain_management systems and enterprise_resource
planning systems.
Industrial machinery can typically identify products through either barcode or
RFID technologies. Information in traditional bar codes is stored as a sequence
of black and white bars varying in width, which when read by laser is
translated into a digital sequence, which according to fixed rules can be
converted into a decimal number or other data. Sometimes information in a bar
code can be transmitted through radio frequency, more typically radio
transmission is used in RFID tags. An RFID tag is card containing a memory chip
and an antenna which transmits signals to a reader. RFID may be found on
merchandise, animals, vehicles and people as well.
***** Logistics: profession and organizations[edit] *****
A logistician is a professional logistics practitioner. Professional
logisticians are often certified by professional associations. One can either
work in a pure logistics company, such as a shipping line, airport, or freight
forwarder, or within the logistics department of a company. However, as
mentioned above, logistics is a broad field, encompassing procurement,
production, distribution, and disposal activities. Hence, career perspectives
are broad as well. A new trend in the industry are the 4PL, or fourth-party
logistics, firms, consulting companies offering logistics services.
Some universities and academic institutions train students as logisticians,
offering undergraduate and postgraduate programs. A university with a primary
focus on logistics is KÃ¼hne_Logistics_University in Hamburg, Germany. It is
non profit and supported by KÃ¼hne-Foundation of the logistics entrepreneur
Klaus_Michael_KÃ¼hne.
The Chartered_Institute_of_Logistics_and_Transport (CILT), established in the
United_Kingdom in 1919, received a Royal_Charter in 1926. The Chartered
Institute is one of the professional_bodies or institutions for the logistics
and transport sectors that offers professional_qualifications or degrees in
logistics management. CILT programs can be studied at centers around UK, some
of which also offer distance learning options.[28] The institute also have
overseas branches namely The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport
Australia (CILTA)[29] in Australia and Chartered Institute of Logistics and
Transport in Hong Kong (CILTHK)[30] in Hong Kong. In the UK, Logistics
Management programs are conducted by many universities and professional bodies
such as CILT. These programs are generally offered at the postgraduate level.
The Global_Institute_of_Logistics[31] established in New York in 2003 is a
Think_Tank for the profession and is primarily concerned with intercontinental
maritime logistics. It is particularly concerned with container logistics and
the role of the seaport_authority in the maritime logistics chain.The Institute
has developed a community of over 8,500 logisticians who act a global knowledge
network committed to supporting the Institute's mission of contributing to the
resolution of legacy challenges in global logistics. Challenges associated with
the traditional approach of managing single transport modes, modal systems as
stand-alone operations. The key to overcoming these legacy challenges is for
the individual stakeholder groups within the logistics chain to actively engage
with each other. The promotion of this agenda is the Institute's work.
The International_Association_of_Public_Health_Logisticians (IAPHL)[32] is a
professional network that promotes the professional development of supply chain
managers and others working in the field of public health logistics and
commodity security, with particular focus on developing countries. The
association supports logisticians worldwide by providing a community of
practice, where members can network, exchange ideas, and improve their
professional skills.
