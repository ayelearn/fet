Vector Analysis is a textbook by Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson, first published in 1901
and based on the lectures that Josiah_Willard_Gibbs had delivered on the
subject at Yale_University. The book did much to standardize the notation and
vocabulary of three-dimensional linear_algebra and vector_calculus, as used by
physicists and mathematicians. It went through seven editions (1913, 1916,
1922, 1925, 1929, 1931, and 1943). The work is now in the public domain. It was
reprinted by Dover_Publications in 1960.

***** Contents[edit] *****
The book carries the subtitle "A text-book for the use of students of
mathematics and physics. Founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs, Ph.D.,
LL.D." The first chapter covers vectors in three spatial dimensions, the
concept of a (real) scalar, and the product of a scalar with a vector. The
second chapter introduces the dot and cross_products for pairs of vectors.
These are extended to a scalar_triple_product and a quadruple product. Pages
77–81 cover the essentials of spherical_trigonometry, a topic of considerable
interest at the time because of its use in celestial_navigation. The third
chapter introduces the vector calculus notation based on the del_operator. The
Helmholtz_decomposition of a vector_field is given on page 237.
The final eight pages develop bivectors as these were integral to the course on
the electromagnetic theory of light that Professor Gibbs taught at Yale. First
Wilson associates a bivector with an ellipse. The product of the bivector with
a complex_number on the unit_circle is then called an elliptical rotation.
Wilson continues with a description of elliptic harmonic motion and the case of
stationary_waves.
***** Genesis[edit] *****
Professor Gibbs produced an 85-page outline of his treatment of vectors for use
by his students and had sent a copy to Oliver_Heaviside in 1888. In 1892
Heaviside, who was formulating his own vectorial system in the Transactions of
the Royal Society, praised Gibbs' "little book", saying it "deserves to be well
known". However, he also noted that it was "much too condensed for a first
introduction to the subject".[1]
On the occasion of the bicentennial of Yale University, a series of
publications were to be issued to showcase Yale's role in the advancement of
knowledge. Gibbs was authoring Elementary_Principles_in_Statistical_Mechanics
for that series. Mindful of the demand for innovative university textbooks, the
editor of the series, Professor Morris, wished to include also a volume
dedicated to Gibbs's lectures on vectors, but Gibbs's time and attention were
entirely absorbed by the Statistical Mechanics.
E. B. Wilson was then a new graduate student in mathematics. He had learned
about quaternions from James Mills Peirce at Harvard, but Dean A. W. Phillips
persuaded him to take Gibbs's course on vectors, which treated similar problems
from a rather different perspective. After Wilson had completed the course,
Morris approached him about the project of producing a textbook. Wilson wrote
the book by expanding his own class notes, providing exercises, and consulting
with others (including his father).[2]
