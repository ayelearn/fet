The ocean's biologically driven sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere to
the ocean interior and seafloor
Air-sea exchange of CO2
The biological pump, in its simplest form, is the ocean's biologically driven
sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean interior and seafloor
sediments.[1] It is the part of the oceanic_carbon_cycle responsible for the
cycling of organic_matter formed mainly by phytoplankton during photosynthesis
(soft-tissue pump), as well as the cycling of calcium_carbonate (CaCO3) formed
into shells by certain organisms such as plankton and mollusks (carbonate
pump).[2]

***** Overview[edit] *****
The biological pump can be divided into three distinct phases,[3] the first of
which is the production of fixed carbon by planktonic phototrophs in the
euphotic (sunlit) surface region of the ocean. In these surface waters,
phytoplankton use carbon_dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and other
trace elements (barium, iron, zinc, etc.) during photosynthesis to make
carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Some plankton, (e.g. coccolithophores and
foraminifera) combine calcium (Ca) and dissolved carbonates (carbonic_acid and
bicarbonate) to form a calcium carbonate (CaCO3) protective coating.
Once this carbon is fixed into soft or hard tissue, the organisms either stay
in the euphotic zone to be recycled as part of the regenerative nutrient_cycle
or once they die, continue to the second phase of the biological pump and begin
to sink to the ocean floor. The sinking particles will often form aggregates as
they sink, greatly increasing the sinking rate. It is this aggregation that
gives particles a better chance of escaping predation and decomposition in the
water column and eventually make it to the sea floor.
The fixed carbon that is either decomposed by bacteria on the way down or once
on the sea floor then enters the final phase of the pump and is remineralized
to be used again in primary_production. The particles that escape these
processes entirely are sequestered in the sediment and may remain there for
millions of years. It is this sequestered carbon that is responsible for
ultimately lowering atmospheric CO2.
***** Primary production[edit] *****
The first step in the biological pump is the synthesis of both organic and
inorganic carbon compounds by phytoplankton in the uppermost, sunlit layers of
the ocean.[4] Organic compounds in the form of sugars, carbohydrates, lipids,
and proteins are synthesized during the process of photosynthesis:
CO2 + H2O + light â CH2O + O2
In addition to carbon, organic matter found in phytoplankton is composed of
nitrogen, phosphorus and various trace_metals. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen
and phosphorus varies little and has an average ratio of 106C:16N:1P, known as
the Redfield_ratio. Trace metals such as magnesium, cadmium, iron, calcium,
barium and copper are orders of magnitude less prevalent in phytoplankton
organic material, but necessary for certain metabolic processes and therefore
can be limiting nutrients in photosynthesis due to their lower abundance in the
water column.[3]
Oceanic primary production accounts for about half of the carbon fixation
carried out on Earth. Approximately 50â60 Pg of carbon are fixed by marine
phytoplankton each year despite the fact that they comprise less than 1% of the
total photosynthetic biomass on Earth. The majority of this carbon fixation
(~80%) is carried out in the open ocean while the remaining amount occurs in
the very productive upwelling regions of the ocean. Despite these productive
regions producing 2 to 3 times as much fixed carbon per area, the open ocean
accounts for greater than 90% of the ocean area and therefore is the larger
contributor.[3]
***** Calcium carbonate[edit] *****
Carbon is also biologically fixed in the form of calcium_carbonate (CaCO3) used
as a protective coating for many planktonic species (coccolithophores,
foraminifera) as well as larger marine organisms (mollusk shells). While this
form of carbon is not directly taken from the atmospheric budget, it is formed
from dissolved forms of carbonate which are in equilibrium with CO2 and then
responsible for removing this carbon via sequestration.[5]
CO2 + H2O â H2CO3 â H+ + HCO3â
Ca2+ + 2HCO3â â CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O
While this process does manage to fix a large amount of carbon, two units of
alkalinity are sequestered for every unit of sequestered carbon, thereby
lowering the pH of surface water and raising atmospheric CO2.[2][6] The
formation and sinking of CaCO3 drives a surface to deep alkalinity gradient
which serves to raise the partial_pressure of dissolved CO2 in surface waters
and actually raise atmospheric levels. In addition, the sequestration of CaCO3
serves to lower overall oceanic alkalinity and again raise atmospheric levels.
[1]
***** Marine snow[edit] *****
The vast majority of carbon incorporated in organic and inorganic biological
matter is formed at the sea surface and then must sink to the ocean floor. A
single phytoplankton cell has a sinking rate around 1 m per day and with 4000 m
as the average depth of the ocean, it can take over ten years for these cells
to reach the ocean floor. However, through processes such as coagulation and
expulsion in predator fecal pellets, these cells form aggregates. These
aggregates, known as marine_snow, have sinking rates orders of magnitude
greater than individual cells and complete their journey to the deep in a
matter of days.[3]
White Cliffs of Dover
Of the 50â60 Pg of carbon fixed annually, roughly 10% leaves the surface
mixed layer of the oceans, while less than 0.5% of eventually reaches the sea
floor.[3] Most is retained in regenerated production in the euphotic zone and a
significant portion is remineralized in midwater processes during particle
sinking. The portion of carbon that leaves the surface mixed layer of the ocean
is sometimes considered "sequestered", and essentially removed from contact
with the atmosphere for many centuries.[7] However, work also finds that, in
regions such as the Southern_Ocean, much of this carbon can quickly (within
decades) come back into contact with the atmosphere.[8] The portion of carbon
that makes it to the sea floor becomes part of the geologic record and in the
case of the calcium carbonate, may form large deposits and resurface through
tectonic motion as in the case with the White_Cliffs_of_Dover in Southern
England. These cliffs are made almost entirely of the plates of buried
coccolithophores.
***** Quantification[edit] *****
As the biological pump plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle,
significant effort is spent quantifying its strength. However, because they
occur as a result of poorly constrained ecological interactions usually at
depth, the processes that form the biological pump are difficult to measure. A
common method is to estimate primary production fuelled by nitrate and ammonium
as these nutrients have different sources that are related to the
remineralisation of sinking material. From these it is possible to derive the
so-called f-ratio, a proxy for the local strength of the biological pump.
Applying the results of local studies to the global scale is complicated by the
role the ocean's circulation plays in different ocean regions.[9]
The biological pump has a physico-chemical counterpart known as the solubility
pump. For an overview of both pumps, see Raven & Falkowski (1999).[10]
***** Anthropogenic changes[edit] *****
Estimated vertical inventory of "present day" (1990s) anthropogenic CO2
It was recently determined that coccolithophore concentrations in the North
Atlantic have increased by an order of magnitude since the 1960s and an
increase in absorbed CO2, as well as temperature, were modeled to be the most
likely cause of this increase.[11]
Changes in land use, the combustion of fossil_fuels, and the production of
cement have led to an increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. At
present, about one third (approximately 2 Pg C yâ1 = 2 Ã 1015 grams of
carbon per year)[12][13] of anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are believed to be
entering the ocean. However, the biological pump is not believed to play a
significant role in the net uptake of CO2 by oceans. This is because the
biological pump is primarily limited by the availability of light and
nutrients, and not by carbon. This is in contrast to the situation on land,
where elevated atmospheric concentrations of CO2 may increase primary
production because land plants are able to improve their water-use efficiency
(= decrease transpiration) when CO2 is easier to obtain.[14] However, there are
still considerable uncertainties in the marine carbon cycle, and some research
suggests that a link between elevated CO2 and marine primary production exists.
[15]
However, climate_change may affect the biological pump in the future by warming
and stratifying the surface ocean. It is believed that this could decrease the
supply of nutrients to the euphotic zone, reducing primary production there.
Also, changes in the ecological success of calcifying organisms caused by ocean
acidification may affect the biological pump by altering the strength of the
hard tissues pump.[16] This may then have a "knock-on" effect on the soft
tissues pump because calcium carbonate acts to ballast sinking organic
material.[17]

      06-01. The value of NEP depends on the boundaries defined for the
      ecosystem. If one considers the sunlit surface ocean down to the 1% light
      level (the âeuphotic zoneâ) over the course of an entire year, then
      NEP is equivalent to the particulate organic carbon sinking into the dark
      ocean interior plus the dissolved organic carbon being circulated out of
      the euphotic zone. In this case, NEP is also often referred to as
      âexport productionâ (or ânew productionâ (Dugdale & Goering
      1967), as discussed below).
