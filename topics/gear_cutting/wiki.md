Gear cutting is any machining process for creating a gear. The most common
gear-cutting processes include hobbing, broaching, milling, and grinding. Such
cutting operations may occur either after or instead of forming processes such
as forging, extruding, investment_casting, or sand_casting.
Gears are commonly made from metal, plastic, and wood. Although gear cutting is
a substantial industry, many metal and plastic gears are made without cutting,
by processes such as die_casting or injection_molding. Some metal gears made
with powder_metallurgy require subsequent machining, whereas others are
complete after sintering. Likewise, metal or plastic gears made with additive
manufacturing may or may not require finishing by cutting, depending on
application.

***** Processes[edit] *****
**** Broaching[edit] ****
Main article: Broaching_(metalworking)
For very large gears or spline, a vertical broach is used. It consists of a
vertical rail that carries a single tooth cutter formed to create the tooth
shape. A rotary_table and a Y axis are the customary axes available. Some
machines will cut to a depth on the Y axis and index the rotary table
automatically. The largest gears are produced on these machines.
Other operations such as broaching work particularly well for cutting teeth on
the inside. The downside to this is that it is expensive and different broach
sticks are required to make different sized gears. Therefore, it is mostly used
in very high production runs.
**** Hobbing[edit] ****
Main article: Hobbing

Hobbing is a method by which a hob is used to cut teeth into a blank. The
cutter and gear blank are rotated at the same time to transfer the profile of
the hob onto the gear blank. Used very often for all sizes of production runs,
but works best for medium to high.
**** Milling or grinding[edit] ****
Main article: Machining
Spur may be cut or ground on a milling_machine or jig_grinder utilizing a
numbered gear_cutter, and any indexing_head or rotary table. The number of the
gear cutter is determined by the tooth count of the gear to be cut.
To machine a helical_gear on a manual machine, a true indexing fixture must be
used. Indexing fixtures can disengage the drive worm, and be attached via an
external gear_train to the machine table's handle (like a power feed). It then
operates similarly to a carriage on a lathe. As the table moves on the X axis,
the fixture will rotate in a fixed ratio with the table. The indexing fixture
itself receives its name from the original purpose of the tool: moving the
table in precise, fixed increments. If the indexing worm is not disengaged from
the table, one can move the table in a highly controlled fashion via the
indexing plate to produce linear movement of great precision (such as a vernier
scale).
There are a few different types of cutters used when creating gears. One is a
rack shaper. These are straight and move in a direction tangent to the gear,
while the gear. They have six to twelve teeth and eventually have to be moved
back to the starting point to begin another cut.
**** Shaping[edit] ****
Main article: Gear_shaper
The old method of gear cutting is mounting a gear blank in a shaper and using a
tool shaped in the profile of the tooth to be cut. This method also works for
cutting internal splines.
Another is a pinion-shaped cutter that is used in a gear shaper machine. It is
basically when a cutter that looks similar to a gear cuts a gear blank. The
cutter and the blank must have a rotating axis parallel to each other. This
process works well for low and high production runs.
**** Finishing[edit] ****
After being cut the gear can be finished by shaving, burnishing, grinding,
honing or lapping.[1]
