The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two thermodynamic_systems are
each in thermal_equilibrium with a third one, then they are in thermal
equilibrium with each other. Accordingly, thermal equilibrium between systems
is a transitive_relation.
Two systems are said to be in the relation of thermal equilibrium if they are
linked by a wall permeable only to heat and they do not change over time.[1] As
a convenience of language, systems are sometimes also said to be in a relation
of thermal equilibrium if they are not linked so as to be able to transfer heat
to each other, but would still not do so (even) if they were connected by a
wall permeable only to heat.
The physical meaning is expressed by Maxwell in the words: "All heat is of the
same kind".[2] Another statement of the law is "All diathermal_walls are
equivalent".[3]
The law is important for the mathematical formulation of thermodynamics, which
needs the assertion that the relation of thermal equilibrium is an equivalence
relation. This information is needed for a mathematical definition of
temperature that will agree with the physical existence of valid thermometers.

***** Zeroth law as equivalence relation[edit] *****
A thermodynamic_system is by definition in its own state of internal
thermodynamic equilibrium, that is to say, there is no change in its observable
state (i.e. macrostate) over time and no flows occur in it. One precise
statement of the zeroth law is that the relation of thermal equilibrium is an
equivalence_relation on pairs of thermodynamic systems.[5] In other words, the
set of all systems each in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium
may be divided into subsets in which every system belongs to one and only one
subset, and is in thermal equilibrium with every other member of that subset,
and is not in thermal equilibrium with a member of any other subset. This means
that a unique "tag" can be assigned to every system, and if the "tags" of two
systems are the same, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and if
different, they are not. This property is used to justify the use of empirical
temperature as a tagging system. Empirical temperature provides further
relations of thermally equilibrated systems, such as order and continuity with
regard to "hotness" or "coldness", but these are not implied by the standard
statement of the zeroth law.
If it is defined that a thermodynamic system is in thermal equilibrium with
itself (i.e., thermal equilibrium is reflexive), then the zeroth law may be
stated as follows:[6]
     If a bodyC, be in thermal equilibrium with two other bodies,AandB,
     thenAandBare in thermal equilibrium with one another.
This statement asserts that thermal equilibrium is a left-Euclidean_relation
between thermodynamic systems. If we also define that every thermodynamic
system is in thermal equilibrium with itself, then thermal equilibrium is also
a reflexive_relation. Binary_relations that are both reflexive and Euclidean
are equivalence relations. Thus, again implicitly assuming reflexivity, the
zeroth law is therefore often expressed as a right-Euclidean statement:[7]
     If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then
     they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
One consequence of an equivalence relationship is that the equilibrium
relationship is symmetric: If A is in thermal equilibrium with B, then B is in
thermal equilibrium with A. Thus we may say that two systems are in thermal
equilibrium with each other, or that they are in mutual equilibrium. Another
consequence of equivalence is that thermal equilibrium is a transitive
relationship and is occasionally expressed as such:[4][8]
     IfAis in thermal equilibrium withBand ifBis in thermal equilibrium
     withC, thenAis in thermal equilibrium withC.
A reflexive, transitive relationship does not guarantee an equivalence
relationship. In order for the above statement to be true, both reflexivity and
symmetry must be implicitly assumed.
It is the Euclidean relationships which apply directly to thermometry. An ideal
thermometer is a thermometer which does not measurably change the state of the
system it is measuring. Assuming that the unchanging reading of an ideal
thermometer is a valid "tagging" system for the equivalence classes of a set of
equilibrated thermodynamic systems, then if a thermometer gives the same
reading for two systems, those two systems are in thermal equilibrium, and if
we thermally connect the two systems, there will be no subsequent change in the
state of either one. If the readings are different, then thermally connecting
the two systems will cause a change in the states of both systems and when the
change is complete, they will both yield the same thermometer reading. The
zeroth law provides no information regarding this final reading.
***** Foundation of temperature[edit] *****
The zeroth law establishes thermal equilibrium as an equivalence relationship.
An equivalence relationship on a set (such as the set of all systems each in
its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium) divides that set into a
collection of distinct subsets ("disjoint subsets") where any member of the set
is a member of one and only one such subset. In the case of the zeroth law,
these subsets consist of systems which are in mutual equilibrium. This
partitioning allows any member of the subset to be uniquely "tagged" with a
label identifying the subset to which it belongs. Although the labeling may be
quite arbitrary,[9] temperature is just such a labeling process which uses the
real_number_system for tagging. The zeroth law justifies the use of suitable
thermodynamic systems as thermometers to provide such a labeling, which yield
any number of possible empirical_temperature_scales, and justifies the use of
the second_law_of_thermodynamics to provide an absolute, or thermodynamic
temperature scale. Such temperature scales bring additional continuity and
ordering (i.e., "hot" and "cold") properties to the concept of temperature.[7]
In the space of thermodynamic parameters, zones of constant temperature form a
surface, that provides a natural order of nearby surfaces. One may therefore
construct a global temperature function that provides a continuous ordering of
states. The dimensionality of a surface of constant temperature is one less
than the number of thermodynamic parameters, thus, for an ideal gas described
with three thermodynamic parameters P, V and N, it is a two-dimensional
surface.
For example, if two systems of ideal gases are in equilibrium, then P1V1/N1 =
P2V2/N2 where Pi is the pressure in the ith system, Vi is the volume, and Ni is
the amount (in moles, or simply the number of atoms) of gas.
The surface PV/N = constant defines surfaces of equal thermodynamic
temperature, and one may label defining T so that PV/N = RT, where R is some
constant. These systems can now be used as a thermometer to calibrate other
systems. Such systems are known as "ideal gas thermometers".
In a sense, focused on in the zeroth law, there is only one kind of diathermal
wall or one kind of heat, as expressed by Maxwell's dictum that "All heat is of
the same kind".[2] But in another sense, heat is transferred in different
ranks, as expressed by Sommerfeld's dictum "Thermodynamics investigates the
conditions that govern the transformation of heat into work. It teaches us to
recognize temperature as the measure of the work-value of heat. Heat of higher
temperature is richer, is capable of doing more work. Work may be regarded as
heat of an infinitely high temperature, as unconditionally available heat."[10]
This is why temperature is the particular variable indicated by the zeroth
law's statement of equivalence.
***** Physical meaning of the usual statement of the zeroth law[edit] *****
The present article states the zeroth law as it is often summarized in
textbooks. Nevertheless, this usual statement perhaps does not explicitly
convey the full physical meaning that underlies it. The underlying physical
meaning was perhaps first clarified by Maxwell in his 1871 textbook.[2]
In CarathÃ©odory's (1909) theory, it is postulated that there exist walls
"permeable only to heat", though heat is not explicitly defined in that paper.
This postulate is a physical postulate of existence. It does not, however, as
worded just previously, say that there is only one kind of heat. This paper of
CarathÃ©odory states as proviso 4 of its account of such walls: "Whenever each
of the systems S1 and S2 is made to reach equilibrium with a third system S3
under identical conditions, systems S1 and S2 are in mutual equilibrium".[11]
It is the function of this statement in the paper, not there labeled as the
zeroth law, to provide not only for the existence of transfer of energy other
than by work or transfer of matter, but further to provide that such transfer
is unique in the sense that there is only one kind of such wall, and one kind
of such transfer. This is signaled in the postulate of this paper of
CarathÃ©odory that precisely one non-deformation variable is needed to complete
the specification of a thermodynamic state, beyond the necessary deformation
variables, which are not restricted in number. It is therefore not exactly
clear what CarathÃ©odory means when in the introduction of this paper he writes
"It is possible to develop the whole theory without assuming the existence of
heat, that is of a quantity that is of a different nature from the normal
mechanical quantities."
Maxwell (1871) discusses at some length ideas which he summarizes by the words
"All heat is of the same kind".[2] Modern theorists sometimes express this idea
by postulating the existence of a unique one-dimensional hotness manifold, into
which every proper temperature scale has a monotonic mapping.[12] This may be
expressed by the statement that there is only one kind of temperature,
regardless of the variety of scales in which it is expressed. Another modern
expression of this idea is that "All diathermal walls are equivalent".[13] This
might also be expressed by saying that there is precisely one kind of non-
mechanical, non-matter-transferring contact equilibrium between thermodynamic
systems.
These ideas may be regarded as helping to clarify the physical meaning of the
usual statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics. It is the opinion of Lieb
and Yngvason (1999) that the derivation from statistical mechanics of the law
of entropy increase is a goal that has so far eluded the deepest thinkers.[14]
Thus the idea remains open to consideration that the existence of heat and
temperature are needed as coherent primitive concepts for thermodynamics, as
expressed, for example, by Maxwell and Planck. On the other hand, Planck in
1926 clarified how the second law can be stated without reference to heat or
temperature, by referring to the irreversible and universal nature of friction
in natural thermodynamic processes.[15]
***** History[edit] *****
According to Arnold_Sommerfeld, Ralph_H._Fowler invented the title 'the zeroth
law of thermodynamics' when he was discussing the 1935 text of Saha and
Srivastava. They write on page 1 that "every physical quantity must be
measurable in numerical terms". They presume that temperature is a physical
quantity and then deduce the statement "If a body A is in temperature
equilibrium with two bodies B and C, then B and C themselves will be in
temperature equilibrium with each other". They then in a self-standing
paragraph italicize as if to state their basic postulate: "Any of the physical
properties of A which change with the application of heat may be observed and
utilised for the measurement of temperature." They do not themselves here use
the term 'zeroth law of thermodynamics'.[16][17] There are very many statements
of these physical ideas in the physics literature long before this text, in
very similar language. What was new here was just the label 'zeroth law of
thermodynamics'. Fowler, with co-author Edward_A._Guggenheim, wrote of the
zeroth law as follows:
            ...we introduce the postulate: If two assemblies are each in
            thermal equilibrium with a third assembly, they are in thermal
            equilibrium with each other.
They then proposed that "it may be shown to follow that the condition for
thermal equilibrium between several assemblies is the equality of a certain
single-valued function of the thermodynamic states of the assemblies, which may
be called the temperature t, any one of the assemblies being used as a
"thermometer" reading the temperature t on a suitable scale. This postulate of
the "Existence of temperature" could with advantage be known as the zeroth law
of thermodynamics". The first sentence of this present article is a version of
this statement.[18] It is not explicitly evident in the existence statement of
Fowler and Guggenheim that temperature refers to a unique attribute of a state
of a system, such as is expressed in the idea of the hotness manifold. Also
their statement refers explicitly to statistical mechanical assemblies, not
explicitly to macroscopic thermodynamically defined systems.
