Heat and Mass Transfer is a peer-reviewed scientific_journal published by
Springer. It serves the circulation of new developments in the field of basic
research of heat and mass_transfer phenomena, as well as related material
properties and their measurements. Thereby applications to engineering problems
are promoted. The journal publishes original research reports.
As of 1995 the title "WÃ¤rme- und StoffÃ¼bertragung was changed to Heat and
Mass Transfer.
