A container designed to hold gases or liquids at a pressure substantially
different from the ambient pressure
A pressure vessel constructed of a horizontal steel cylinder.
A pressure vessel is a container designed to hold gases or liquids at a
pressure substantially different from the ambient_pressure.
Pressure vessels can be dangerous, and fatal accidents have occurred in the
history of their development and operation. Consequently, pressure vessel
design, manufacture, and operation are regulated by engineering authorities
backed by legislation. For these reasons, the definition of a pressure vessel
varies from country to country.
Design involves parameters such as maximum safe operating pressure and
temperature, safety_factor, corrosion allowance and minimum design temperature
(for brittle fracture). Construction is tested using nondestructive_testing,
such as ultrasonic_testing, radiography, and pressure tests. Hydrostatic tests
use water, but pneumatic tests use air or another gas. Hydrostatic testing is
preferred, because it is a safer method, as much less energy is released if a
fracture occurs during the test (water does not rapidly increase its volume
when rapid depressurization occurs, unlike gases like air, which fail
explosively).
In most countries, vessels over a certain size and pressure must be built to a
formal code. In the United States that code is the ASME_Boiler_and_Pressure
Vessel_Code_(BPVC). These vessels also require an authorized inspector to sign
off on every new vessel constructed and each vessel has a nameplate with
pertinent information about the vessel, such as maximum allowable working
pressure, maximum temperature, minimum design metal temperature, what company
manufactured it, the date, its registration number (through the National
Board), and ASME's official stamp for pressure vessels (U-stamp). The nameplate
makes the vessel traceable and officially an ASME Code vessel.

***** History of pressure vessels[edit] *****
A 10,000 psi (69 MPa) pressure vessel from 1919, wrapped with high tensile
steel banding and steel rods to secure the end caps.
The earliest documented design of pressure vessels was described in 1495 in the
book by Leonardo da Vinci, the Codex Madrid I, in which containers of
pressurized air were theorized to lift heavy weights underwater.[1] However,
vessels resembling those used today did not come about until the 1800s, when
steam was generated in boilers helping to spur the industrial_revolution.[1]
However, with poor material quality and manufacturing techniques along with
improper knowledge of design, operation and maintenance there was a large
number of damaging and often fatal explosions associated with these boilers and
pressure vessels, with a death occurring on a nearly daily basis in the United
States.[1] Local providences and states in the US began enacting rules for
constructing these vessels after some particularly devastating vessel failures
occurred killing dozens of people at a time, which made it difficult for
manufacturers to keep up with the varied rules from one location to another and
the first pressure vessel code was developed starting in 1911 and released in
1914, starting the ASME_Boiler_and_Pressure_Vessel_Code_(BPVC).[1] In an early
effort to design a tank capable of withstanding pressures up to 10,000 psi
(69 MPa), a 6-inch (150 mm) diameter tank was developed in 1919 that was
spirally-wound with two layers of high tensile strength steel wire to prevent
sidewall rupture, and the end caps longitudinally reinforced with lengthwise
high-tensile rods.[2] The need for high pressure and temperature vessels for
petroleum refineries and chemical plants gave rise to vessels joined with
welding instead of rivets (which were unsuitable for the pressures and
temperatures required) and in the 1920s and 1930s the BPVC included welding as
an acceptable means of construction, and welding is the main means of joining
metal vessels today.[1]
There have been many advancements in the field of pressure vessel engineering
such as advanced non-destructive examination, phased array ultrasonic testing
and radiography, new material grades with increased corrosion resistance and
stronger materials, and new ways to join materials such as explosion welding
(to attach one metal sheet to another, usually a thin corrosion resistant metal
like stainless steel to a stronger metal like carbon steel), friction stir
welding (which attaches the metals together without melting the metal),
advanced theories and means of more accurately assessing the stresses
encountered in vessels such as with the use of Finite Element Analysis,
allowing the vessels to be built safer and more efficiently. Today vessels in
the USA require BPVC stamping but the BPVC is not just a domestic code, many
other countries have adopted the BPVC as their official code. There are,
however, other official codes in some countries (some of which rely on portions
of and reference the BPVC), Japan, Australia, Canada, Britain, and Europe have
their own codes. Regardless of the country nearly all recognize the inherent
potential hazards of pressure vessels and the need for standards and codes
regulating their design and construction.
***** Pressure vessel features[edit] *****
**** Shape of a pressure vessel[edit] ****
Pressure vessels can theoretically be almost any shape, but shapes made of
sections of spheres, cylinders, and cones are usually employed. A common design
is a cylinder with end caps called heads. Head shapes are frequently either
hemispherical or dished (torispherical). More complicated shapes have
historically been much harder to analyze for safe operation and are usually far
more difficult to construct.

    * Cylindrical pressure vessel.
    * Picture of the bottom of an aerosol spray can.
    * Fire Extinguisher with rounded rectangle pressure vessel
Theoretically, a spherical pressure vessel has approximately twice the strength
of a cylindrical pressure vessel with the same wall thickness,[3] and is the
ideal shape to hold internal pressure.[1] However, a spherical shape is
difficult to manufacture, and therefore more expensive, so most pressure
vessels are cylindrical with 2:1 semi-elliptical heads or end caps on each end.
Smaller pressure vessels are assembled from a pipe and two covers. For
cylindrical vessels with a diameter up to 600 mm (NPS of 24 in), it is possible
to use seamless pipe for the shell, thus avoiding many inspection and testing
issues, mainly the nondestructive examination of radiography for the long seam
if required. A disadvantage of these vessels is that greater diameters are more
expensive, so that for example the most economic shape of a 1,000 litres
(35 cu ft), 250 bars (3,600 psi) pressure vessel might be a diameter of 91.44
centimetres (36 in) and a length of 1.7018 metres (67 in) including the 2:
1 semi-elliptical domed end caps.
**** Construction materials[edit] ****
Composite overwrapped pressure vessel with titanium liner.
Many pressure vessels are made of steel. To manufacture a cylindrical or
spherical pressure vessel, rolled and possibly forged parts would have to be
welded together. Some mechanical properties of steel, achieved by rolling or
forging, could be adversely affected by welding, unless special precautions are
taken. In addition to adequate mechanical strength, current standards dictate
the use of steel with a high impact resistance, especially for vessels used in
low temperatures. In applications where carbon steel would suffer corrosion,
special corrosion resistant material should also be used.
Some pressure vessels are made of composite_materials, such as filament_wound
composite using carbon_fibre held in place with a polymer. Due to the very high
tensile strength of carbon fibre these vessels can be very light, but are much
more difficult to manufacture. The composite material may be wound around a
metal liner, forming a composite_overwrapped_pressure_vessel.
Other very common materials include polymers such as PET in carbonated beverage
containers and copper in plumbing.
Pressure vessels may be lined with various metals, ceramics, or polymers to
prevent leaking and protect the structure of the vessel from the contained
medium. This liner may also carry a significant portion of the pressure load.
[4][5]
Pressure Vessels may also be constructed from concrete (PCV) or other materials
which are weak in tension. Cabling, wrapped around the vessel or within the
wall or the vessel itself, provides the necessary tension to resist the
internal pressure. A "leakproof steel thin membrane" lines the internal wall of
the vessel. Such vessels can be assembled from modular pieces and so have "no
inherent size limitations".[6] There is also a high order of redundancy thanks
to the large number of individual cables resisting the internal pressure.
The very small vessels used to make liquid butane fueled cigarette lighters are
subjected to about 2 bar pressure, depending on ambient temperature. These
vessels are often oval (1 x 2 cm ... 1.3 x 2.5 cm) in cross section but
sometimes circular. The oval versions generally include one or two internal
tension struts which appear to be baffles but which also provide additional
cylinder strength.

*** Working pressure[edit] ***
The typical circular-cylindrical high pressure gas cylinders for permanent
gases (that do not liquify at storing pressure, like air, oxygen, nitrogen,
hydrogen, argon, helium) have been manufactured by hot forging by pressing and
rolling to get a seamless steel vessel.
Working pressure of cylinders for use in industry, skilled craft, diving and
medicine had a standardized working pressure (WP) of only 150 bars (2,200 psi)
in Europe until about 1950. From about 1975 until now, the standard pressure is
200 bars (2,900 psi). Firemen need slim, lightweight cylinders to move in
confined spaces; since about 1995 cylinders for 300 bars (4,400 psi) WP were
used (first in pure steel).
A demand for reduced weight led to different generations of composite (fiber
and matrix, over a liner) cylinders that are more easily damageable by a hit
from outside. Therefore, composite cylinders are usually built for 300 bars
(4,400 psi).
Hydraulic (filled with water) testing pressure is usually 50% higher than the
working pressure.
*** Vessel thread[edit] ***
Until 1990, high pressure cylinders were produced with conical (tapered)
threads. Two types of threads have dominated the full metal cylinders in
industrial use from 0.2 to 50 litres (0.0071 to 1.7657 cu ft) in volume. To
screw in the valve, a high torque of typically 200 Nâm (150 lbfâft) is
necessary for the larger (23 mm?) threads, and 100 Nâm (74 lbfâft) for the
smaller (17 mm?) ones. Until around 1950, hemp was used as a sealant. Later, a
thin sheet of lead pressed to a hat with a hole on top was used. Since 2005,
PTFE-tape has been used to avoid using lead.
A tapered thread provides simple assembly, but requires high torque for
connecting and leads to high radial forces in the vessel neck. All cylinders
built for 300 bar (4,400 psi) working pressure, all diving cylinders, and all
composite cylinders use parallel threads. Either 25 x 1.5 mm or 18 x 1.5 mm for
smaller cylinders. These connections are sealed by an elastomer O-ring
pressurized by the gas, have a bed-stop, and need only about 20 Nâm
(15 lbfâft) of torque which is compatible with all three types of composite
cylinders.
*** Development of composite vessels[edit] ***
To classify the different making principles of composite cylinders 4 types are
defined.
    * Type 1 â Full Metal: Cylinder is fully made from metal.
    * Type 2 â Hoop Wrap: Metal cylinder, reinforced by a belt-like hoop wrap
      with fibre-material. The spherical bottom and head of a cylindrical
      cylinder withstand by geometrical reasons twice the pressure as the
      cylindrical shell (uniform metal wall thickness assumed).
    * Type 3 â Fully Wrapped, over Metal Liner: Diagonally wrapped fibres
      build up the pressure resisting wall even at the bottom and around the
      metal neck. The metal liner is thin and makes the vessel gas tight.
    * Type 4 â Fully Wrapped, over Non-Metal Liner: A typical lightweight
      thermoplast liner builds up the (very) gas tight barrier, and the
      (somewhat inflated) bobbin to wrap fibres and matrix (polyester or epoxy
      resin) around. Only the neck and its anchor fitting to the liner is still
      made of metal, lightweight aluminium or sturdy stainless steel.
Type 2 and 3 cylinders came up around 1995. Type 4 cylinders are commercially
available at least from 2016 on.
**** Safety features[edit] ****
*** Leak before burst[edit] ***
Leak before burst describes a pressure vessel designed such that a crack in the
vessel will grow through the wall, allowing the contained fluid to escape and
reducing the pressure, prior to growing so large as to cause fracture at the
operating pressure.
Many pressure vessel standards, including the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Code[7] and the AIAA metallic pressure vessel standard, either require pressure
vessel designs to be leak before burst, or require pressure vessels to meet
more stringent requirements for fatigue and fracture if they are not shown to
be leak before burst.[8]
*** Safety valves[edit] ***
Example of a valve used for gas cylinders.
As the pressure vessel is designed to a pressure, there is typically a safety
valve or relief_valve to ensure that this pressure is not exceeded in
operation.
**** Maintenance features[edit] ****
*** Pressure vessel closures[edit] ***
Pressure vessel closures are pressure retaining structures designed to provide
quick access to pipelines, pressure vessels, pig traps, filters and filtration
systems. Typically pressure vessel closures allow maintenance personnel.
***** Uses[edit] *****
An LNG carrier ship with four pressure vessels for liquefied_natural_gas.
Pressure vessels are used in a variety of applications in both industry and the
private sector. They appear in these sectors as industrial compressed_air
receivers and domestic_hot_water_storage_tanks. Other examples of pressure
vessels are diving_cylinders, recompression_chambers, distillation_towers,
pressure_reactors, autoclaves, and many other vessels in mining operations, oil
refineries and petrochemical plants, nuclear_reactor vessels, submarine and
space_ship habitats, pneumatic reservoirs, hydraulic reservoirs under pressure,
rail_vehicle_airbrake_reservoirs, road_vehicle_airbrake_reservoirs, and storage
vessels for liquified gases such as ammonia, chlorine, and LPG (propane,
butane).
A unique application of a pressure vessel is the passenger cabin of an
airliner: the outer skin carries both the aircraft maneuvering loads and the
cabin_pressurization loads.
    * A pressure tank connected to a water well and domestic hot water system.
    * A few pressure tanks, here used to hold propane.
    * A pressure vessel used as a kier.
    * A pressure vessel used for The Boeing Companyâs CST-100 spacecraft.
***** Alternatives to pressure vessels[edit] *****
    * Natural_gas_storage
    * Gas_holder
Depending on the application and local circumstances, alternatives to pressure
vessels exist. Examples can be seen in domestic water collection systems, where
the following may be used:
    * Gravity-controlled systems[9] which typically consist of an unpressurized
      water_tank at an elevation higher than the point of use. Pressure at the
      point of use is the result of the hydrostatic pressure caused by the
      elevation difference. Gravity systems produce 0.43 pounds per square inch
      (3.0 kPa) per foot of water head (elevation difference). A municipal
      water supply or pumped water is typically around 90 pounds per square
      inch (620 kPa).
    * Inline_pump_controllers or pressure-sensitive pumps.[10]
***** Design[edit] *****
**** Scaling[edit] ****
No matter what shape it takes, the minimum mass of a pressure vessel scales
with the pressure and volume it contains and is inversely proportional to the
strength_to_weight_ratio of the construction material (minimum mass decreases
as strength increases[11]).
*** Scaling of stress in walls of vessel[edit] ***
Pressure vessels are held together against the gas pressure due to tensile
forces within the walls of the container. The normal (tensile) stress in the
walls of the container is proportional to the pressure and radius of the vessel
and inversely proportional to the thickness of the walls.[12] Therefore,
pressure vessels are designed to have a thickness proportional to the radius of
tank and the pressure of the tank and inversely proportional to the maximum
allowed normal stress of the particular material used in the walls of the
container.
Because (for a given pressure) the thickness of the walls scales with the
radius of the tank, the mass of a tank (which scales as the length times radius
times thickness of the wall for a cylindrical tank) scales with the volume of
the gas held (which scales as length times radius squared). The exact formula
varies with the tank shape but depends on the density, Ï, and maximum
allowable stress Ï of the material in addition to the pressure P and volume V
of the vessel. (See below for the exact equations for the stress in the walls.)
*** Spherical vessel[edit] ***
For a sphere, the minimum mass of a pressure vessel is
         M =   3 2   P V   &#x03C1; &#x03C3;     {\displaystyle M={3 \over 2}PV
      {\rho \over \sigma }}  [M={3 \over 2}PV{\rho  \over \sigma }],
where:
    *    M   {\displaystyle M}  [M] is mass, (kg)
    *    P   {\displaystyle P}  [P] is the pressure difference from ambient
      (the gauge_pressure), (Pa)
    *    V   {\displaystyle V}  [V] is volume,
    *    &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is the density of the
      pressure vessel material, (kg/m^3)
    *    &#x03C3;   {\displaystyle \sigma }  [\sigma ] is the maximum working
      stress that material can tolerate. (Pa)[13]
Other shapes besides a sphere have constants larger than 3/2 (infinite
cylinders take 2), although some tanks, such as non-spherical wound composite
tanks can approach this.
*** Cylindrical vessel with hemispherical ends[edit] ***
This is sometimes called a "bullet"[citation_needed] for its shape, although in
geometric terms it is a capsule.
For a cylinder with hemispherical ends,
         M = 2 &#x03C0;  R  2   ( R + W ) P   &#x03C1; &#x03C3;
      {\displaystyle M=2\pi R^{2}(R+W)P{\rho \over \sigma }}  [M=2\pi R^{2}
      (R+W)P{\rho  \over \sigma }],
where
    * R is the radius (m)
    * W is the middle cylinder width only, and the overall width is W + 2R (m)
      [14]
*** Cylindrical vessel with semi-elliptical ends[edit] ***
In a vessel with an aspect_ratio of middle cylinder width to radius of 2:1,
         M = 6 &#x03C0;  R  3   P   &#x03C1; &#x03C3;     {\displaystyle M=6\pi
      R^{3}P{\rho \over \sigma }}  [M=6\pi R^{3}P{\rho  \over \sigma }].
*** Gas storage[edit] ***
In looking at the first equation, the factor PV, in SI units, is in units of
(pressurization) energy. For a stored gas, PV is proportional to the mass of
gas at a given temperature, thus
         M =   3 2   n R T   &#x03C1; &#x03C3;     {\displaystyle M={3 \over
      2}nRT{\rho \over \sigma }}  [M={3 \over 2}nRT{\rho  \over \sigma }]. (see
      gas_law)
The other factors are constant for a given vessel shape and material. So we can
see that there is no theoretical "efficiency of scale", in terms of the ratio
of pressure vessel mass to pressurization energy, or of pressure vessel mass to
stored gas mass. For storing gases, "tankage efficiency" is independent of
pressure, at least for the same temperature.
So, for example, a typical design for a minimum mass tank to hold helium (as a
pressurant gas) on a rocket would use a spherical chamber for a minimum shape
constant, carbon fiber for best possible     &#x03C1;  /  &#x03C3;
{\displaystyle \rho /\sigma }  [\rho /\sigma ], and very cold helium for best
possible     M  /   p V    {\displaystyle M/{pV}}  [M/{pV}].
**** Stress in thin-walled pressure vessels[edit] ****
Stress in a shallow-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a sphere is
          &#x03C3;  &#x03B8;   =  &#x03C3;   l o n g    =    p r   2 t
      {\displaystyle \sigma _{\theta }=\sigma _{\rm {long}}={\frac {pr}{2t}}}
      [\sigma _{\theta }=\sigma _{{{\rm {long}}}}={\frac  {pr}{2t}}],
where      &#x03C3;  &#x03B8;     {\displaystyle \sigma _{\theta }}  [\sigma _
{\theta }] is hoop stress, or stress in the circumferential direction,
&#x03C3;  l o n g     {\displaystyle \sigma _{long}}  [\sigma _{{long}}] is
stress in the longitudinal direction, p is internal gauge pressure, r is the
inner radius of the sphere, and t is thickness of the sphere wall. A vessel can
be considered "shallow-walled" if the diameter is at least 10 times (sometimes
cited as 20 times) greater than the wall depth.[15]
Stress in the cylinder body of a pressure vessel.
Stress in a shallow-walled pressure vessel in the shape of a cylinder is
          &#x03C3;  &#x03B8;   =    p r  t     {\displaystyle \sigma _{\theta
      }={\frac {pr}{t}}}  [\sigma _{\theta }={\frac  {pr}{t}}],
          &#x03C3;   l o n g    =    p r   2 t      {\displaystyle \sigma _{\rm
      {long}}={\frac {pr}{2t}}}  [\sigma _{{{\rm {long}}}}={\frac  {pr}{2t}}],
where:
    *     &#x03C3;  &#x03B8;     {\displaystyle \sigma _{\theta }}  [\sigma _
      {\theta }] is hoop_stress, or stress in the circumferential direction
    *     &#x03C3;  l o n g     {\displaystyle \sigma _{long}}  [\sigma _{
      {long}}] is stress in the longitudinal direction
    * p is internal gauge pressure
    * r is the inner radius of the cylinder
    * t is thickness of the cylinder wall.
Almost all pressure vessel design standards contain variations of these two
formulas with additional empirical terms to account for variation of stresses
across thickness, quality control of welds and in-service corrosion allowances.
All formulae mentioned above assume uniform distribution of membrane stresses
across thickness of shell but in reality, that is not the case. Deeper analysis
is given by Lame's theory. The formulae of pressure vessel design standards are
extension of Lame's theory by putting some limit on ratio of inner radius and
thickness.
For example, the ASME_Boiler_and_Pressure_Vessel_Code_(BPVC) (UG-27) formulas
are:[16]
Spherical shells: Thickness has to be less than 0.356 times inner radius
          &#x03C3;  &#x03B8;   =  &#x03C3;   l o n g    =    p ( r + 0.2 t )
      2 t E      {\displaystyle \sigma _{\theta }=\sigma _{\rm {long}}={\frac
      {p(r+0.2t)}{2tE}}}  [\sigma _{\theta }=\sigma _{{{\rm {long}}}}={\frac
      {p(r+0.2t)}{2tE}}]
Cylindrical shells: Thickness has to be less than 0.5 times inner radius
          &#x03C3;  &#x03B8;   =    p ( r + 0.6 t )   t E      {\displaystyle
      \sigma _{\theta }={\frac {p(r+0.6t)}{tE}}}  [\sigma _{\theta }={\frac  {p
      (r+0.6t)}{tE}}]
          &#x03C3;   l o n g    =    p ( r &#x2212; 0.4 t )   2 t E
      {\displaystyle \sigma _{\rm {long}}={\frac {p(r-0.4t)}{2tE}}}  [\sigma _{
      {{\rm {long}}}}={\frac  {p(r-0.4t)}{2tE}}]
where E is the joint efficiency, and all others variables as stated above.
The factor_of_safety is often included in these formulas as well, in the case
of the ASME BPVC this term is included in the material stress value when
solving for pressure or thickness.
**** Winding angle of carbon fibre vessels[edit] ****
Wound infinite cylindrical shapes optimally take a winding angle of 54.7
degrees, as this gives the necessary twice the strength in the circumferential
direction to the longitudinal.[17]
**** Operation standards[edit] ****
Pressure vessels are designed to operate safely at a specific pressure and
temperature, technically referred to as the "Design Pressure" and "Design
Temperature". A vessel that is inadequately designed to handle a high pressure
constitutes a very significant safety hazard. Because of that, the design and
certification of pressure vessels is governed by design codes such as the ASME
Boiler_and_Pressure_Vessel_Code in North America, the Pressure_Equipment
Directive of the EU (PED), Japanese_Industrial_Standard (JIS), CSA B51 in
Canada, Australian_Standards in Australia and other international_standards
like Lloyd's, Germanischer_Lloyd, Det_Norske_Veritas, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale de
Surveillance (SGS S.A.), Lloydâs_Register_Energy_Nederland_(formerly_known_as
Stoomwezen) etc.
Note that where the pressure-volume product is part of a safety standard, any
incompressible liquid in the vessel can be excluded as it does not contribute
to the potential energy stored in the vessel, so only the volume of the
compressible part such as gas is used.

  15. ^ For a sphere the thickness d = rP/2Ï, where r is the radius of the
      tank. The volume of the spherical surface then is 4Ïr2d = 4Ïr3P/2Ï.
      The mass is determined by multiplying by the density of the material that
      makes up the walls of the spherical vessel. Further the volume of the gas
      is (4Ïr3)/3. Combining these equations give the above results. The
      equations for the other geometries are derived in a similar manner
