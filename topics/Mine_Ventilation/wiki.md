Schematic of underground mine ventilation
The mine ventilation fan, before 1908
Underground mine ventilation provides a flow of air to the underground_workings
of a mine of sufficient volume to dilute and remove dust and noxious gases
(typically NOx, SO2, methane, CO2 and CO) and to regulate temperature. The
source of these gases are equipment that runs on diesel_engines, blasting with
explosives,[1] and the orebody itself.[2] The largest component of the
operating cost for mine ventilation is electricity to power the ventilation
fans, which may account for one third of a typical underground mine's entire
electrical power cost.[1]

***** Types of ventilation[edit] *****
Flow-through ventilation is the main ventilation circuit for the mine. Air
enters the mine from surface via a shaft, ventilation_raise or adit. The air is
distributed through the mine via internal ventilation raises and ramps, and
flows are controlled by regulators and permanently mounted ventilation fans. An
auxiliary ventilation system takes air from the flow-through system and
distributes it to the mine workings via temporarily mounted ventilation fans,
venturies and disposable fabric or steel ducting. Auxiliary fan and duct
systems may be either forcing systems, where fresh air is pushed into mine
headings, or exhausting systems that draw out contaminated air.[3]
***** Ventilation control[edit] *****
Sufficient volume of air is required for proper ventilation. A bulk of electric
power is required for driving fans. By installing variable speed control air
quantity can be optimized hence the power.[4] At every place in the mine where
persons are required to work or pass, the air should not contain less than 19%
of oxygen or more than 0.5% of carbon dioxide or any noxious gas in quantity
likely to affect the health of any person. The percentage of inflammable gas
does not exceed 0.75% in the general body of the return air of any ventilating
district and 1.25% in any place in the mine.
***** Regulations[edit] *****
The volume (expressed in cubic_feet_per_minute or cubic_meters_per_second) of
air required to ventilate an underground mine is determined by mining_engineers
based on a wide variety of parameters. In most countries minimum requirements
are outlined by law, regulation or standards. However, in some developing
countries the mandated ventilation requirement may be insufficient, and the
mining company may have to increase the ventilation flow, in particular where
ventilation may be required to cool the ambient temperature in a deep hot mine,
however auto-compression must also be taken into account.[1] As per CMR 130-2-
(i), in every ventilating district not less than six cubic metres per minute of
air per person employed in the district on the largest shift or not less than
2.5 cubic metres per minute of air per daily tonne output whichever is larger,
passes along the last ventilation connection in the district which means the
inbye-most gallery in the district along which the air passes.
***** Heating[edit] *****
In temperate_climates ventilation air may need to be heated during winter
months. This will make the working environment more hospitable for miners, and
prevent freezing of workings, in particular water pipes. In Arctic mines, where
the mining horizon is above the permafrost, heating may not take place to
prevent melting the permafrost. "Cold mines" such as Raglan_Mine and Nanisivik
Mine are designed to operate below 0Â°C.[1]
The wet_bulb_temperature in any working place does not exceed 33.5Â°C and where
the wet bulb temperature exceeds 30.5Â°C arrangements are made to ventilate the
same with a current of air moving at a speed of not less than one metre per
second.
