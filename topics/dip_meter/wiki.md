      âDip meterâ can also refer to an influential early commercial expert
      system called Dipmeter_Advisor; or may refer to an instrument that
      measures the âdip angleâ of the planetâs magnetic field, the field
      line angle in a vertical plane.

Grid dip oscillator (GDO), also called grid dip meter, gate dip meter, dip
meter, or just dipper, is a type of electronic instrument that measures the
resonant_frequency of unconnected, nearby radio_frequency circuits. It is a
variable_frequency_oscillator that circulates a small-amplitude signal through
an exposed coil, whose electromagnetic field can interact with adjacent
circuitry. The oscillator loses power when its coil is near a circuit that
resonates at the same frequency. A meter on the GDO registers the amplitude
drop, or âdipâ, hence the name.
Dip oscillators have been widely used by amateur_radio_operators for measuring
the properties of resonant circuits, filters, and antennas. They can also be
used for transmission line testing, as signal generators, and for measuring
inductance and capacitance of components. Measurement with a GDO is called
âdippingâ a circuit.[1]

***** Principle of operation[edit] *****
Central to the dip meter is an HF variable_frequency_oscillator with a
calibrated tuning_capacitor and matching interchangeable coils, as shown in the
circuit diagram to the right. Resonance is indicated by a dip in amplitude of
the signal within the GDO, by a meter on the device.
When the oscillatorâs exposed coil is in the vicinity of another resonant
circuit, the coupled pair behaves as a low_Q transformer whose coupling is most
effective when their respective resonant frequencies match. The degree of
coupling affects the frequency and amplitude of oscillation in the dip meter,
which is sensed in any of several ways, the simplest and most usual of which is
a built-in microammeter. The distance between the coil and the tested circuit
needs to be adjusted carefully so that the GDO amplitude is significantly
affected by the coupled circuit, but its frequency is not.[1][2]:1â8

***** History[edit] *****
Grid dip oscillators were first developed in the 1920s and were then built with
vacuum_tubes. The devices displayed the amplitude of the tubeâs grid current,
hence the âGâ in GDO.
Modern dip meters are solid-state devices, and are sometimes called gate dip
oscillators or emitter dip oscillators in reference to the analogous part of
the transistor whose current is measured instead of a vacuum tube grid.[1]
Solid-state versions of the grid dip oscillator are more versatile, since they
can operate at higher_Q and lower amplitude.
Dip meters of all types are being supplanted by Antenna_analyzers, which are
more complicated, but perform many of the same functions more conveniently, and
require less dexterity.[3]
***** Operation[edit] *****
Two Heathkit Grid Dip Meters with a set of tuning coils.
The heart of the instrument is a tunable LC_circuit whose exposed external coil
will loosely couple to the measured resonant_circuit when held moderately
close-by. The measuring distance must be skillfully adjusted to be close enough
to provide sufficient coupling for the dip to show clearly, but far enough that
the meter and the tested circuit oscillate independently, so neither deviceâs
frequency is significantly distorted by the other, and so that power lost to
the external circuit does not swamp the dip meterâs oscillator.
The coil and the test circuit can either be inductively or capacitively
coupled: Coupling is inductive if the coil wires are held parallel to the
nearest wires of the circuit being tested, capacitive if the coil wires and the
circuit wires are held perpendicular. Depending on the context desired for the
measurement, the circuit under test can be temporarily disconnected from its
surroundings to avoid distortion by the parts it is normally attached to, or
left wired in place to measure the response of the combined system.
In ordinary use, only the oscillator in the dip meter is powered, and the
circuit under testâs only power is what it drains from the signal in the GDO
coil. When both circuits are resonant at the same frequency, power transfer
from the coil to the adjacent tested circuit reaches a maximum, consequently
the dip meterâs oscillator amplitude reaches a minimum due to the power lost
to the circuit under test.[1]:25.10
The operator adjusts the frequency of the GDO until its meter shows its lowest
reading (the âdipâ). The frequency is read off of the dial on the GDO, or
the frequency can be measured by finding the dip meterâs signal on a well-
calibrated radio receiver. Some modern GDOs have a built-in frequency meter,
which makes over-coupling somewhat less troublesome.[1]
Some dip meters can be used in reverse, as ultra-short-range, tuned field
strength_meters. The operator finds the frequency at which the highest rise in
meter power occurs in the unpowered GDO, when its coil is held near the wires
of an active resonant circuit. Since the power in the circuit under test must
be high enough to register on the meter, this uncommon method is risky both for
the operator and the equipment.
