Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the
science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist, plant scientist or
phytologist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term "botany"
comes from the Ancient_Greek word Î²Î¿ÏÎ¬Î½Î· (botanÄ) meaning "pasture",
"grass", or "fodder"; Î²Î¿ÏÎ¬Î½Î· is in turn derived from Î²ÏÏÎºÎµÎ¹Î½
(boskein), "to feed" or "to graze".[1][2][3] Traditionally, botany has also
included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists
respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining
within the sphere of interest of the International_Botanical_Congress.
Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 species
of land_plants of which some 391,000 species are vascular_plants (including
approximately 369,000 species of flowering_plants),[4] and approximately 20,000
are bryophytes.[5]
Botany originated in prehistory as herbalism with the efforts of early humans
to identify â and later cultivate â edible, medicinal and poisonous plants,
making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic_gardens, often
attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were
forerunners of the first botanical_gardens attached to universities, founded
from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua_botanical_garden.
These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue
and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant_taxonomy, and led
in 1753 to the binomial_system of Carl_Linnaeus that remains in use to this
day.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of
plants, including methods of optical_microscopy and live_cell_imaging, electron
microscopy, analysis of chromosome_number, plant_chemistry and the structure
and function of enzymes and other proteins. In the last two decades of the 20th
century, botanists exploited the techniques of molecular_genetic_analysis,
including genomics and proteomics and DNA_sequences to classify plants more
accurately.
Modern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other
areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant
structure, growth and differentiation, reproduction, biochemistry and primary
metabolism, chemical_products, development, diseases, evolutionary
relationships, systematics, and plant_taxonomy. Dominant themes in 21st century
plant science are molecular_genetics and epigenetics, which are the mechanisms
and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant_cells and
tissues. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing staple_foods,
materials such as timber, oil, rubber, fibre and drugs, in modern horticulture,
agriculture and forestry, plant_propagation, breeding and genetic_modification,
in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy
production, in environmental_management, and the maintenance of biodiversity.

[engraving_of_cork_cells_from_Hooke's_Micrographia,_1665]
An engraving of the cells of cork, from Robert_Hooke's Micrographia, 1665
Botany originated as herbalism, the study and use of plants for their medicinal
properties.[6] Many records of the Holocene period date early botanical
knowledge as far back as 10,000 years ago.[7] This early unrecorded knowledge
of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee,
which make up much of the Cherokee land today.[7] The early recorded history of
botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of
early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back
to before 1100 BC,[8][9] in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China
before it was unified in 221 BC.[8][10]
Modern botany traces its roots back to Ancient_Greece specifically to
Theophrastus (c. 371â287 BC), a student of Aristotle who invented and
described many of its principles and is widely regarded in the scientific
community as the "Father of Botany".[11] His major works, Enquiry_into_Plants
and On the Causes of Plants, constitute the most important contributions to
botanical science until the Middle_Ages, almost seventeen centuries later.[11]
[12]
Another work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De
Materia Medica, a five-volume encyclopedia about herbal_medicine written in the
middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius
Dioscorides. De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years.[13]
Important contributions from the medieval_Muslim_world include Ibn_Wahshiyya's
Nabatean Agriculture, AbÅ«_á¸¤anÄ«fa_DÄ«nawarÄ«'s (828â896) the Book of
Plants, and Ibn_Bassal's The Classification of Soils. In the early 13th
century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and Ibn_al-Baitar (d. 1248) wrote on botany in
a systematic and scientific manner.[14][15][16]
In the mid-16th century, "botanical_gardens" were founded in a number of
Italian universities â the Padua_botanical_garden in 1545 is usually
considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These
gardens continued the practical value of earlier "physic gardens", often
associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for medical use.
They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given
about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated.
Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was
the University_of_Oxford_Botanic_Garden in 1621. Throughout this period, botany
remained firmly subordinate to medicine.[17]
German physician Leonhart_Fuchs (1501â1566) was one of "the three German
fathers of botany", along with theologian Otto_Brunfels (1489â1534) and
physician Hieronymus_Bock (1498â1554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).[18]
[19] Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works
to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of
plant classification.
Physician Valerius_Cordus (1515â1544) authored a botanically and
pharmacologically important herbal Historia Plantarum in 1544 and a
pharmacopoeia of lasting importance, the Dispensatorium in 1546.[20] Naturalist
Conrad_von_Gesner (1516â1565) and herbalist John_Gerard (1545âc. 1611)
published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist Ulisse
Aldrovandi (1522â1605) was considered the father of natural history, which
included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, Polymath
Robert_Hooke discovered cells, a term he coined, in cork, and a short time
later in living plant tissue.[21]

The Linnaean_Garden of Linnaeus' residence in Uppsala, Sweden, was planted
according to his Systema sexuale.
During the 18th century, systems of plant_identification were developed
comparable to dichotomous_keys, where unidentified plants are placed into
taxonomic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices
between pairs of characters. The choice and sequence of the characters may be
artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic_keys) or more
closely related to the natural or phyletic_order of the taxa in synoptic keys.
[22] By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in
increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies
worldwide. In 1753, Carl_von_LinnÃ© (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species
Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the
reference point for modern_botanical_nomenclature. This established a
standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name
represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus.
[23] For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified
plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The
24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts,
mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.[24]
Increasing knowledge of plant_anatomy, morphology and life cycles led to the
realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the
artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. Adanson (1763), de_Jussieu (1789), and
Candolle (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of
classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and
were widely followed. The Candollean_system reflected his ideas of the
progression of morphological complexity and the later_classification by Bentham
and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by
Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin_of_Species in 1859 and
his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system
to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological
similarity.[25]
Botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first "modern" textbook,
Matthias_Schleiden's GrundzÃ¼ge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik, published in
English in 1849 as Principles of Scientific Botany.[26] Schleiden was a
microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the cell_theory with
Theodor_Schwann and Rudolf_Virchow and was among the first to grasp the
significance of the cell_nucleus that had been described by Robert_Brown in
1831.[27] In 1855, Adolf_Fick formulated Fick's_laws that enabled the
calculation of the rates of molecular_diffusion in biological systems.[28]

identification, here, the specific name glauca means blue.
**** Late modern botany[edit] ****
[Micropropagation_of_transgenic_plants]
Micropropagation of transgenic plants
Building upon the gene-chromosome theory of heredity that originated with
Gregor_Mendel (1822â1884), August_Weismann (1834â1914) proved that
inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on
inherited characters.[29] The work of Katherine_Esau (1898â1997) on plant
anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy
and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts for
more than half a century.[30][31]
The discipline of plant_ecology was pioneered in the late 19th century by
botanists such as Eugenius_Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants
form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen_C._RaunkiÃ¦r whose
system for describing plant_life_forms is still in use today. The concept that
the composition of plant communities such as temperate_broadleaf_forest changes
by a process of ecological_succession was developed by Henry_Chandler_Cowles,
Arthur_Tansley and Frederic_Clements. Clements is credited with the idea of
climax_vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can
support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology.[32][33]
[34] Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse_de_Candolle, Nikolai
Vavilov (1887â1943) produced accounts of the biogeography, centres_of_origin,
and evolutionary history of economic plants.[35]
Particularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of
the physics of plant_physiological processes such as transpiration (the
transport of water within plant tissues), the temperature dependence of rates
of water evaporation from the leaf surface and the molecular_diffusion of water
vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures. These developments,
coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, and the
rate of photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas
exchange between plants and the atmosphere.[36][37] Innovations in statistical
analysis by Ronald_Fisher,[38] Frank_Yates and others at Rothamsted
Experimental_Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis
in botanical research.[39] The discovery and identification of the auxin plant
hormones by Kenneth_V._Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by
externally applied chemicals. Frederick_Campion_Steward pioneered techniques of
micropropagation and plant_tissue_culture controlled by plant hormones.[40] The
synthetic auxin 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic_acid or 2,4-D was one of the first
commercial synthetic herbicides.[41]
20th century developments in plant biochemistry have been driven by modern
techniques of organic_chemical_analysis, such as spectroscopy, chromatography
and electrophoresis. With the rise of the related molecular-scale biological
approaches of molecular_biology, genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, the
relationship between the plant genome and most aspects of the biochemistry,
physiology, morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed
experimental analysis.[42] The concept originally stated by Gottlieb_Haberlandt
in 1902[43] that all plant cells are totipotent and can be grown in vitro
ultimately enabled the use of genetic_engineering experimentally to knock out a
gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as GFP
that report when a gene of interest is being expressed. These technologies
enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in
bioreactors to synthesise pesticides, antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals, as
well as the practical application of genetically_modified_crops designed for
traits such as improved yield.[44]
Modern morphology recognises a continuum between the major morphological
categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome.[45]
Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics.[46] Modern systematics aims to
reflect and discover phylogenetic_relationships between plants.[47][48][49][50]
Modern Molecular_phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters,
relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA_sequences from most
families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group to publish
in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering many of the questions about
relationships among angiosperm families and species.[51] The theoretical
possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and
commercial varieties by DNA_barcoding is the subject of active current
research.[52][53]
***** Scope and importance[edit] *****
[A_herbarium_specimen_of_the_lady_fern,_Athyrium_filix-femina]
Botany involves the recording and description of plants, such as this herbarium
specimen of the lady fern Athyrium_filix-femina.
The study of plants is vital because they underpin almost all animal life on
Earth by generating a large proportion of the oxygen and food that provide
humans and other organisms with aerobic_respiration with the chemical energy
they need to exist. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of
organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of
sunlight to convert water and carbon_dioxide[54] into sugars that can be used
both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in
the structural components of cells.[55] As a by-product of photosynthesis,
plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all
living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are
influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and
stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion.[56] Plants are crucial to the future
of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for
people, as well as creating and preserving soil.[57]
Historically, all living things were classified as either animals or plants[58]
and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals.[59]
Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant
organelles, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant
communities. At each of these levels, a botanist may be concerned with the
classification (taxonomy), phylogeny and evolution, structure (anatomy and
morphology), or function (physiology) of plant life.[60]
The strictest definition of "plant" includes only the "land plants" or
embryophytes, which include seed_plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and
flowering_plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, clubmosses,
liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes
descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by
photosynthesis. They have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid
phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, known as the gametophyte,
nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for at
least part of its life,[61] even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte
itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte.[62] Other groups of organisms that
were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in
bacteriology), fungi (mycology) â including lichen-forming fungi
(lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology).
However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi
(including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in
introductory botany courses.[63][64]
Palaeobotanists study ancient plants in the fossil record to provide
information about the evolutionary_history_of_plants. Cyanobacteria, the first
oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given
rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship
with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells.
The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated
the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the
ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been
abundant for more than 2 billion years.[65][66]
Among the important botanical questions of the 21st century are the role of
plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients:
energy, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and water, and ways that our plant stewardship
can help address the global environmental issues of resource_management,
conservation, human_food_security, biologically_invasive_organisms, carbon
sequestration, climate_change, and sustainability.[67]
**** Human nutrition[edit] ****
Further information: Human_nutrition
[grains_of_brown_rice,_a_staple_food]
The food we eat comes directly or indirectly from plants such as rice.
Virtually all staple foods come either directly from primary_production by
plants, or indirectly from animals that eat them.[68] Plants and other
photosynthetic organisms are at the base of most food_chains because they use
the energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere, converting
them into a form that can be used by animals. This is what ecologists call the
first trophic_level.[69] The modern forms of the major staple_foods, such as
hemp, teff, maize, rice, wheat and other cereal grasses, pulses, bananas and
plantains,[70] as well as hemp, flax and cotton grown for their fibres, are the
outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among wild
ancestral_plants with the most desirable characteristics.[71]
Botanists study how plants produce food and how to increase yields, for example
through plant_breeding, making their work important to humanity's ability to
feed the world and provide food_security for future generations.[72] Botanists
also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the
biology and control of plant_pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems.
[73] Ethnobotany is the study of the relationships between plants and people.
When applied to the investigation of historical plantâpeople relationships
ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany.[74] Some
of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous_people
of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants.[75] This
relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by
ethnobotanists.[75]
***** Plant biochemistry[edit] *****
Plant biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes used by plants. Some
of these processes are used in their primary_metabolism like the photosynthetic
Calvin_cycle and crassulacean_acid_metabolism.[76] Others make specialised
materials like the cellulose and lignin used to build their bodies, and
secondary_products like resins and aroma_compounds.

through paper_chromatography
Xanthophylls
Chlorophyll_a
Chlorophyll_b
Plants and various other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes collectively known
as "algae" have unique organelles known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are
thought to be descended from cyanobacteria that formed endosymbiotic
relationships with ancient plant and algal ancestors. Chloroplasts and
cyanobacteria contain the blue-green pigment chlorophyll_a.[77] Chlorophyll a
(as well as its plant and green algal-specific cousin chlorophyll_b)[a] absorbs
light in the blue-violet and orange/red parts of the spectrum while reflecting
and transmitting the green light that we see as the characteristic colour of
these organisms. The energy in the red and blue light that these pigments
absorb is used by chloroplasts to make energy-rich carbon compounds from carbon
dioxide and water by oxygenic_photosynthesis, a process that generates
molecular_oxygen (O2) as a by-product.

The light energy captured by chlorophyll_a is initially in the form of
electrons (and later a proton_gradient) that's used to make molecules of ATP
and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in
the light-independent_reactions of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to
produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate (G3P).
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw
material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of
biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch
which is stored in the chloroplast.[81] Starch is the characteristic energy
store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of fructose is
used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the
glucose is converted to sucrose (common table sugar) for export to the rest of
the plant.
Unlike in animals (which lack chloroplasts), plants and their eukaryote
relatives have delegated many biochemical roles to their chloroplasts,
including synthesising all their fatty_acids,[82][83] and most amino_acids.[84]
The fatty acids that chloroplasts make are used for many things, such as
providing material to build cell_membranes out of and making the polymer cutin
which is found in the plant_cuticle that protects land plants from drying out.
[85]
Plants synthesise a number of unique polymers like the polysaccharide molecules
cellulose, pectin and xyloglucan[86] from which the land plant cell wall is
constructed.[87] Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to strengthen
the secondary_cell_walls of xylem tracheids and vessels to keep them from
collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is
also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma_fibres that provide structural
support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a
chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen
of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the
pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker
for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.[88] The
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it
was when plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods.
Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae
have since independently evolved[89] pathways like Crassulacean_acid_metabolism
and the C4_carbon_fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses
resulting from photorespiration in the more common C3_carbon_fixation pathway.
These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants.
**** Medicine and materials[edit] ****
[Plantation_worker_tapping_a_rubber_tree]
Tapping a rubber tree in Thailand
Phytochemistry is a branch of plant biochemistry primarily concerned with the
chemical substances produced by plants during secondary_metabolism.[90] Some of
these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others,
such as the essential_oils peppermint_oil and lemon oil are useful for their
aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as
pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium_poppies. Many medicinal and recreational
drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine,
morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives
of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the
acetyl ester of salicylic_acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow
trees,[91] and a wide range of opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by
chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium_poppy.[92] Popular
stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate,
and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of
carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes
(wine).[93] Native_Americans have used various plants as ways of treating
illness or disease for thousands of years.[94] This knowledge Native Americans
have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been
used by pharmaceutical_companies as a way of drug_discovery.[95]
Plants can synthesise useful coloured dyes and pigments such as the
anthocyanins responsible for the red colour of red_wine, yellow weld and blue
woad used together to produce Lincoln_green, indoxyl, source of the blue dye
indigo traditionally used to dye denim and the artist's pigments gamboge and
rose_madder. Sugar, starch, cotton, linen, hemp, some types of rope, wood and
particle_boards, papyrus and paper, vegetable_oils, wax, and natural_rubber are
examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their
secondary products. Charcoal, a pure form of carbon made by pyrolysis of wood,
has a long history as a metal-smelting fuel, as a filter material and adsorbent
and as an artist's material and is one of the three ingredients of gunpowder.
Cellulose, the world's most abundant organic polymer,[96] can be converted into
energy, fuels, materials and chemical feedstock. Products_made_from_cellulose
include rayon and cellophane, wallpaper_paste, biobutanol and gun_cotton.
Sugarcane, rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly fermentable
sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels, important
alternatives to fossil_fuels, such as biodiesel.[97] Sweetgrass was used by
Native Americans to ward off bugs like mosquitoes.[98] These bug repelling
properties of sweetgrass were later found by the American_Chemical_Society in
the molecules phytol and coumarin.[98]
***** Plant ecology[edit] *****
Main article: Plant_ecology
Parker Method also called the loop method for analyzing vegetation, useful for
quantitatively measuring species and cover over time and changes from grazing,
wildfires and invasive species. Demonstrated by American botanist Thayne Tuason
and an assistant.
Plant ecology is the science of the functional relationships between plants and
their habitats â the environments where they complete their life_cycles.
Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their
biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their
environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other
species.[99] Some ecologists even rely on empirical_data from indigenous people
that is gathered by ethnobotanists.[100] This information can relay a great
deal of information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it
has changed over that time.[100] The goals of plant ecology are to understand
the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact,
evolution, and responses to environmental change.[101]
Plants depend on certain edaphic (soil) and climatic factors in their
environment but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change
their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilise mineral
soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants
compete with other organisms in their ecosystem for resources.[102][103] They
interact with their neighbours at a variety of spatial_scales in groups,
populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions
with characteristic vegetation_types and dominant plants as well as similar
abiotic and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes like tundra
or tropical_rainforest.[104]
[Colour_photograph_of_roots_of_Medicago_italica,_showing_root_nodules]
The nodules of Medicago_italica contain the nitrogen_fixing bacterium
Sinorhizobium_meliloti. The plant provides the bacteria with nutrients and an
anaerobic environment, and the bacteria fix_nitrogen for the plant.[105]
Herbivores eat plants, but plants can defend_themselves and some species are
parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial
relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide
plants with nutrients in exchange for food, ants are recruited by ant_plants to
provide protection,[106] honey_bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers
[107][108] and humans and other_animals[109] act as dispersal_vectors to spread
spores and seeds.
**** Plants, climate and environmental change[edit] ****
Plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our
understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity.
For example, plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in
historical_climatology, and the biological impact of climate_change and global
warming. Palynology, the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from
thousands_or_millions_of_years_ago allows the reconstruction of past climates.
[110] Estimates of atmospheric CO
2 concentrations since the Palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal
densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land_plants.[111] Ozone
depletion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet_radiation-B (UV-B),
resulting in lower growth rates.[112] Moreover, information from studies of
community_ecology, plant systematics, and taxonomy is essential to
understanding vegetation_change, habitat_destruction and species_extinction.

***** Genetics[edit] *****

purple (B) and white (b) blossoms
Inheritance in plants follows the same fundamental principles of genetics as in
other multicellular organisms. Gregor_Mendel discovered the genetic_laws_of
inheritance by studying inherited traits such as shape in Pisum sativum (peas).
What Mendel learned from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside
of botany. Similarly, "jumping_genes" were discovered by Barbara_McClintock
while she was studying maize.[114] Nevertheless, there are some distinctive
genetic differences between plants and other organisms.
Species boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species
hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha Ã
piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha_aquatica and spearmint, Mentha
spicata.[115] The many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple
inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids.[116]
Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility_mechanisms
that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to
reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes.[117] This is
one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing.[118] In many land
plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These
species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes
and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.[119]
Unlike in higher animals, where parthenogenesis is rare, asexual_reproduction
may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem
tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats,
where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by_animals are rare, plantlets
or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual_reproduction with
asexual_reproduction and giving rise to clonal_populations genetically
identical to the parent. This is one of several types of apomixis that occur in
plants. Apomixis can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an
embryo genetically identical to the parent.[120]
Most sexually_reproducing organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but
doubling of their chromosome_number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis.
This can occur early in development to produce an autopolyploid or partly
autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation
to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during
gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation_event
between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can
often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with
the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These
plants that are reproductively_isolated from the parent species but live within
the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new
species.[121] Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce
vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical
individuals.[121] Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while
bread_wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana is an example of a
sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common_dandelion is a triploid that produces
viable seeds by apomictic seed.
As in other eukaryotes, the inheritance of endosymbiotic organelles like
mitochondria and chloroplasts in plants is non-Mendelian. Chloroplasts are
inherited through the male parent in gymnosperms but often through the female
parent in flowering plants.[122]
**** Molecular genetics[edit] ****
Further information: Molecular_genetics
[Flowers_of_Arabidopsis_thaliana,_the_most_important_model_plant_and_the_first
to_have_its_genome_sequenced]
Thale cress, Arabidopsis_thaliana, the first plant to have its genome
sequenced, remains the most important model organism.
A considerable amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies
of the molecular genetics of model_plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis
thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae).[90] The genome
or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by
about 135 million base_pairs of DNA, forming one of the smallest genomes among
flowering_plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced,
in 2000.[123] The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice
(Oryza_sativa)[124] and Brachypodium_distachyon,[125] has made them important
model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of
cereals, grasses and monocots generally.
Model_plants such as Arabidopsis_thaliana are used for studying the molecular
biology of plant_cells and the chloroplast. Ideally, these organisms have small
genomes that are well known or completely sequenced, small stature and short
generation times. Corn has been used to study mechanisms of photosynthesis and
phloem loading of sugar in C4_plants.[126] The single_celled green_alga
Chlamydomonas_reinhardtii, while not an embryophyte itself, contains a green-
pigmented chloroplast related to that of land plants, making it useful for
study.[127] A red_alga Cyanidioschyzon_merolae has also been used to study some
basic chloroplast functions.[128] Spinach,[129] peas,[130] soybeans and a moss
Physcomitrella_patens are commonly used to study plant cell biology.[131]
Agrobacterium_tumefaciens, a soil rhizosphere bacterium, can attach to plant
cells and infect them with a callus-inducing Ti_plasmid by horizontal_gene
transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van
Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for
introducing the Nif_gene responsible for nitrogen_fixation in the root nodules
of legumes and other plant species.[132] Today, genetic modification of the Ti
plasmid is one of the main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants
and the creation of genetically_modified_crops.
**** Epigenetics[edit] ****
Main article: Epigenetics
Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene_function that cannot be
explained by changes in the underlying DNA_sequence[133] but cause the
organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently.[134] One
example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA_methylation
which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can
also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the
DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic
marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of
development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences
between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have
the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may
remain through successive cell_divisions for the remainder of the cell's life.
Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable,[135] while others are
reset in the germ cells.
Epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology serve to regulate the process of
cellular_differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem_cells become
the various pluripotent cell_lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully
differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, gives rise to
the many different plant_cell types including parenchyma, xylem_vessel
elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard_cells of the epidermis, etc. as it
continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some
genes and inhibition of others.[136]
Unlike animals, many plant cells, particularly those of the parenchyma, do not
terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to
a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the
sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes
which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as
animals, such as chromatin_remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that
plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the
environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.[137]
Epigenetic changes can lead to paramutations, which do not follow the Mendelian
heritage rules. These epigenetic marks are carried from one generation to the
next, with one allele inducing a change on the other.[138]
***** Plant evolution[edit] *****
Main article: Evolutionary_history_of_plants
[colour_image_of_a_cross_section_of_a_fossil_stem_of_Rhynia_gwynne-vaughanii,_a

The chloroplasts of plants have a number of biochemical, structural and genetic
similarities to cyanobacteria, (commonly but incorrectly known as "blue-green
algae") and are thought to be derived from an ancient endosymbiotic
relationship between an ancestral eukaryotic_cell and a cyanobacterial
resident.[139][140][141][142]
The algae are a polyphyletic group and are placed in various divisions, some
more closely related to plants than others. There are many differences between
them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation,
chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves. The algal division Charophyta,
sister to the green algal division Chlorophyta, is considered to contain the
ancestor of true plants.[143] The Charophyte class Charophyceae and the land
plant sub-kingdom Embryophyta together form the monophyletic group or clade
Streptophytina.[144]
Nonvascular land plants are embryophytes that lack the vascular tissues xylem
and phloem. They include mosses, liverworts and hornworts. Pteridophytic
vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores
germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the Silurian period
and diversified into several lineages during the late Silurian and early
Devonian. Representatives of the lycopods have survived to the present day. By
the end of the Devonian period, several groups, including the lycopods,
sphenophylls and progymnosperms, had independently evolved "megaspory" â
their spores were of two distinct sizes, larger megaspores and smaller
microspores. Their reduced gametophytes developed from megaspores retained
within the spore-producing_organs (megasporangia) of the sporophyte, a
condition known as endospory. Seeds consist of an endosporic megasporangium
surrounded by one or two sheathing layers (integuments). The young sporophyte
develops within the seed, which on germination splits to release it. The
earliest known seed plants date from the latest Devonian Famennian stage.[145]
[146] Following the evolution of the seed habit, seed_plants diversified,
giving rise to a number of now-extinct groups, including seed_ferns, as well as
the modern gymnosperms and angiosperms.[147] Gymnosperms produce "naked seeds"
not fully enclosed in an ovary; modern representatives include conifers,
cycads, Ginkgo, and Gnetales. Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure
such as a carpel or an ovary.[148][149] Ongoing research on the molecular
phylogenetics of living plants appears to show that the angiosperms are a
sister_clade to the gymnosperms.[150]
***** Plant physiology[edit] *****
Further information: Plant_physiology
[A_Venn_diagram_of_the_relationships_between_five_key_areas_of_plant
physiology]
Five of the key areas of study within plant physiology
Plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities
of plants associated with life.[151] Chemicals obtained from the air, soil and
water form the basis of all plant_metabolism. The energy of sunlight, captured
by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by cellular_respiration, is the basis
of almost all life. Photoautotrophs, including all green plants, algae and
cyanobacteria gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis.
Heterotrophs including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants,
and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by
photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and
tissues.[152] Respiration is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them
down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially
the opposite of photosynthesis.[153]
Molecules are moved within plants by transport processes that operate at a
variety of spatial_scales. Subcellular transport of ions, electrons and
molecules such as water and enzymes occurs across cell_membranes. Minerals and
water are transported from roots to other parts of the plant in the
transpiration_stream. Diffusion, osmosis, and active_transport and mass_flow
are all different ways transport can occur.[154] Examples of elements_that
plants_need to transport are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
magnesium, and sulfur. In vascular plants, these elements are extracted from
the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the plant in
the xylem. Most of the elements required for plant_nutrition come from the
chemical breakdown of soil minerals.[155] Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is
transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and plant
hormones are transported by a variety of processes.
**** Plant hormones[edit] ****
[A_diagram_of_the_mechanism_of_phototropism_in_oat_coleoptiles]
1 An oat coleoptile with the sun overhead. Auxin (pink) is evenly distributed
in its tip.
2 With the sun at an angle and only shining on one side of the shoot, auxin
moves to the opposite side and stimulates cell_elongation there.
3 and 4 Extra growth on that side causes the shoot to bend_towards_the_sun.
[156]
Further information: Plant_hormone and Phytochrome
Plants are not passive, but respond to external_signals such as light, touch,
and injury by moving or growing towards or away from the stimulus, as
appropriate. Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous
collapse of leaflets of Mimosa_pudica, the insect traps of Venus_flytrap and
bladderworts, and the pollinia of orchids.[157]
The hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant
hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century.
Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light
[158] and gravity, and concluded "It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the
tip of the radicle . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . .
directing the several movements".[159] About the same time, the role of auxins
(from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined
by the Dutch scientist Frits_Went.[160] The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic
acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50
years later.[161] This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and
roots towards light and gravity.[162] The finding in 1939 that plant callus
could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in
1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the
concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant
biotechnology and genetic modification.[163]
[File:Venus Fly Trap Eating Compilation Scott's Revenge On The
Caterpillars.ogv]Play_media

Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones named for their control of cell
division (especially cytokinesis). The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered
in corn, Zea_mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is
produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell
division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts.[164][165] The
gibberelins, such as Gibberelic_acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl_CoA
via the mevalonate_pathway. They are involved in the promotion of germination
and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling
stem elongation and the control of flowering.[166] Abscisic_acid (ABA) occurs
in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in
the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed
maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named
because it was originally thought to control abscission.[167] Ethylene is a
gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine.
It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening
and abscission,[168][169] and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon
which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale
to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.
Another class of phytohormones is the jasmonates, first isolated from the oil
of Jasminum_grandiflorum[170] which regulates wound responses in plants by
unblocking the expression of genes required in the systemic_acquired_resistance
response to pathogen attack.[171]
In addition to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a
signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much
sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in a
process known as photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a
plant that are sensitive to light.[172]
***** Plant anatomy and morphology[edit] *****
[Colour_image_of_a_19th-century_illustration_of_the_morphology_of_a_rice_plant]

leaves and flowers of the rice plant Oryza_sativa
Plant_anatomy is the study of the structure of plant cells and tissues, whereas
plant_morphology is the study of their external form.[173] All plants are
multicellular eukaryotes, their DNA stored in nuclei.[174][175] The
characteristic features of plant_cells that distinguish them from those of
animals and fungi include a primary cell_wall composed of the polysaccharides
cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, [176] larger vacuoles than in animal cells
and the presence of plastids with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic
functions as in the chloroplasts. Other plastids contain storage products such
as starch (amyloplasts) or lipids (elaioplasts). Uniquely, streptophyte cells
and those of the green algal order Trentepohliales[177] divide by construction
of a phragmoplast as a template for building a cell_plate late in cell
division.[81]
[A_diagram_of_a_"typical"_eudicot,_the_most_common_type_of_plant_(three-fifths

A diagram of a "typical" eudicot, the most common type of plant (three-fifths
of all plant species).[178] No plant actually looks exactly like this though.
The bodies of vascular_plants including clubmosses, ferns and seed_plants
(gymnosperms and angiosperms) generally have aerial and subterranean
subsystems. The shoots consist of stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves
and reproductive structures. The underground vascularised roots bear root_hairs
at their tips and generally lack chlorophyll.[179] Non-vascular plants, the
liverworts, hornworts and mosses do not produce ground-penetrating vascular
roots and most of the plant participates in photosynthesis.[180] The sporophyte
generation is nonphotosynthetic in liverworts but may be able to contribute
part of its energy needs by photosynthesis in mosses and hornworts.[181]
The root system and the shoot system are interdependent â the usually
nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the
usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root
system.[179] Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other
and producing adventitious shoots or roots.[182] Stolons and tubers are
examples of shoots that can grow roots.[183] Roots that spread out close to the
surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new
plants.[184] In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often
regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf,
as is the case with Saintpaulia,[185] or even a single cell â which can
dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow
into a new plant.[182] In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the
conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are
often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch,[179] as in sugar_beets
and carrots.[184]
Stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can
store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or
reproduce_vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or in the process
of layering.[186] Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis.[187]
Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves.[188]
Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-
producing plants with open seeds.[189] Angiosperms are seed-producing_plants
that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds.[148] Woody plants, such as
azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional
types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork).
All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants.[190] Some plants
reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.[191]
Although reference to major morphological categories such as root, stem, leaf,
and trichome are useful, one has to keep in mind that these categories are
linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories
results.[192] Furthermore, structures can be seen as processes, that is,
process combinations.[46]
***** Systematic botany[edit] *****
Further information: Taxonomy_(biology)
[photograph_of_a_botanist_preparing_plant_specimens_for_the_herbarium]
A botanist preparing a plant specimen for mounting in the herbarium
Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the
range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as
determined by their evolutionary history.[193] It involves, or is related to,
biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological
classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories
such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific
taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl_Linnaeus, who grouped
species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have
since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common
descent â grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial
characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify
organisms, molecular_phylogenetics, which uses DNA_sequences as data, has
driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue
to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean_taxonomy. It
includes ranks and binomial_nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical
organisms is codified in the International_Code_of_Nomenclature_for_algae,
fungi,_and_plants (ICN) and administered by the International_Botanical
Congress.[194][195]
Kingdom Plantae belongs to Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until
each species is separately classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or
Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific
name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus,
resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism.[195] For example, the
tiger lily is Lilium_columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the
specific_epithet. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the
scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in
the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the
entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not
available).[196][197][198]
The evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called
its phylogeny. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic
approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine
relationships.[199] As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with
prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such
as an Echinocactus. However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines
produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that
the two genera are indeed related.[200][201]
Two cacti of very different appearance
Pereskia aculeata
Echinocactus grusonii
Although Pereskia is a tree with leaves, it has spines and areoles like a more
typical cactus, such as Echinocactus.
Judging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants
may resemble one another through convergent_evolution in which characters have
arisen independently. Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to
water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as
the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not
closely related. The cladistic_method takes a systematic approach to
characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared
evolutionary history â such as those evolved separately in different groups
(homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) â and
derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared
ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing
areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The
results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams
showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.[202]
From the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies
for living plants has been molecular_phylogenetics, which uses molecular
characters, particularly DNA sequences, rather than morphological characters
like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the
genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of
being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. Clive_Stace
describes this as having "direct access to the genetic basis of evolution."
[203] As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were
thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than
animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of
multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below â fungi are more
closely related to animals than to plants.[204]
plants
   
  fungi
   
   animals
     
In 1998, the Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group published a phylogeny for flowering
plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering
plants. As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families
represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered.[51]
Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to
better understand the process of evolution in plants.[205] Despite the study of
model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and
discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various
taxa.[206] Technological developments such as computers and electron
microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at
which data can be analysed.[207]
