Magnetic reluctance, or magnetic resistance, is a concept used in the analysis
of magnetic_circuits. It is defined as the ratio of magnetomotive_force (mmf)
to magnetic_flux. It represents the opposition to magnetic flux, and depends on
the geometry and composition of an object.
Magnetic reluctance in a magnetic circuit is analogous to electrical_resistance
in an electrical_circuit in that resistance is a measure of the opposition to
the electric_current. The definition of magnetic reluctance is analogous to
Ohm's_law in this respect. However, magnetic flux passing through a reluctance
does not give rise to dissipation of heat as it does for current through a
resistance. Thus, the analogy cannot be used for modelling energy flow in
systems where energy crosses between the magnetic and electrical domains. An
alternative analogy to the reluctance model which does correctly represent
energy flows is the gyratorâcapacitor_model.
Magnetic reluctance is a scalar extensive_quantity, akin to electrical
resistance. The unit for magnetic reluctance is inverse henry, Hâ1.

***** History[edit] *****
The term reluctance was coined in May 1888 by Oliver_Heaviside.[1] The notion
of "magnetic resistance" was first mentioned by James_Joule in 1840.[2] The
idea for a magnetic_flux law, similar to Ohm's_law for closed electric
circuits, is attributed to Henry_Augustus_Rowland in an 1873 paper.[3] Rowland
is also responsible for coining the term magnetomotive force in 1880,[4] also
coined, apparently independently, a bit later in 1883 by Bosanquet.[5]
Reluctance is usually represented by a cursive capital        R
{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\mathcal {R}}}  [\scriptstyle {\mathcal  R}].
***** Definitions[edit] *****
In both AC and DC fields, the reluctance is the ratio of the magnetomotive
force (MMF) in a magnetic_circuit to the magnetic_flux in this circuit. In a
pulsating DC or AC field, the reluctance also pulsates (see phasors).
The definition can be expressed as follows:
           R   =    F  &#x03A6;     {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}={\frac
      {\mathcal {F}}{\Phi }}}  [{\mathcal  {R}}={\frac  {{\mathcal  {F}}}{\Phi
      }}]
where
            R      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\mathcal {R}}}  [\scriptstyle
      {\mathcal  {R}}] ("R") is the reluctance in ampere-turns per weber (a
      unit that is equivalent to turns per henry). "Turns" refers to the
      winding_number of an electrical conductor comprising an inductor.
            F      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\mathcal {F}}}  [\scriptstyle
      {\mathcal {F}}] ("F") is the magnetomotive_force (MMF) in ampere-turns
      Φ ("Phi") is the magnetic_flux in webers.
It is sometimes known as Hopkinson's_law and is analogous to Ohm's_Law with
resistance replaced by reluctance, voltage by MMF and current by magnetic flux.
Permeance is the inverse of reluctance:
           P   =   1  R      {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}={\frac {1}{\mathcal
      {R}}}}  [{\mathcal  P}={\frac  {1}{{\mathcal  R}}}]
Its SI derived unit is the henry (the same as the unit of inductance, although
the two concepts are distinct).
Magnetic flux always forms a closed loop, as described by Maxwell's_equations,
but the path of the loop depends on the reluctance of the surrounding
materials. It is concentrated around the path of least reluctance. Air and
vacuum have high reluctance, while easily magnetized materials such as soft
iron have low reluctance. The concentration of flux in low-reluctance materials
forms strong temporary poles and causes mechanical forces that tend to move the
materials towards regions of higher flux so it is always an attractive force
(pull).
The reluctance of a uniform magnetic circuit can be calculated as:
           R   =   l   &#x03BC;  0    &#x03BC;  r   A    =   l  &#x03BC; A
      {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}={\frac {l}{\mu _{0}\mu _{r}A}}={\frac {l}
      {\mu A}}}  [{\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}={\frac {l}{\mu _{0}\mu _{r}A}}=
      {\frac {l}{\mu A}}}]
where
      l is the length of the circuit in metres
           &#x03BC;  0      {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \mu _{0}}
      [\scriptstyle \mu _{0}] is the permeability of vacuum, equal to     4

***** Applications[edit] *****
    * Constant air gaps can be created in the core of certain transformers to
      reduce the effects of saturation. This increases the reluctance of the
      magnetic circuit, and enables it to store more energy before core
      saturation. This effect is also used in the flyback_transformer.
    * Variable air gaps can be created in the cores by a movable keeper to
      create a flux switch that alters the amount of magnetic flux in a
      magnetic circuit without varying the constant magnetomotive_force in that
      circuit.
    * Variation of reluctance is the principle behind the reluctance_motor (or
      the variable reluctance generator) and the Alexanderson_alternator.
      Another way of saying this is that the reluctance forces strive for a
      maximally aligned magnetic circuit and a minimal air gap distance.
    * Multimedia loudspeakers are typically shielded magnetically, in order to
      reduce magnetic interference caused to televisions and other CRTs. The
      speaker magnet is covered with a material such as soft_iron to minimize
      the stray magnetic field.
Reluctance can also be applied to:
    * Reluctance_motors
    * Variable reluctance (magnetic) pickups
    * Magnetic_capacitance
    * Magnetic_circuit
    * Magnetic_complex_reluctance
