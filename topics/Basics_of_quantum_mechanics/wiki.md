Quantum mechanics is the science of the very small. It explains the behavior of
matter and its interactions with energy on the scale of atoms and subatomic
particles. By contrast, classical_physics explains matter and energy only on a
scale familiar to human experience, including the behavior of astronomical
bodies such as the Moon. Classical physics is still used in much of modern
science and technology. However, towards the end of the 19th century,
scientists discovered phenomena in both the large (macro) and the small (micro)
worlds that classical physics could not explain.[1] The desire to resolve
inconsistencies between observed phenomena and classical theory led to two
major revolutions in physics that created a shift in the original scientific
paradigm: the theory_of_relativity and the development of quantum mechanics.[2]
This article describes how physicists discovered the limitations of classical
physics and developed the main concepts of the quantum theory that replaced it
in the early decades of the 20th century. It describes these concepts in
roughly the order in which they were first discovered. For a more complete
history of the subject, see History_of_quantum_mechanics.
Light behaves in some aspects like particles and in other aspects like waves.
Matterâthe "stuff" of the universe consisting of particles such as electrons
and atomsâexhibits wavelike_behavior too. Some light sources, such as neon
lights, give off only certain frequencies of light. Quantum mechanics shows
that light, along with all other forms of electromagnetic_radiation, comes in
discrete units, called photons, and predicts its energies, colors, and spectral
intensities. A single photon is a quantum, or smallest observable amount, of
the electromagnetic field because a partial photon has never been observed.
More broadly, quantum mechanics shows that many quantities, such as angular
momentum, that appeared continuous in the zoomed-out view of classical
mechanics, turn out to be (at the small, zoomed-in scale of quantum mechanics)
quantized. Angular momentum is required to take on one of a set of discrete
allowable values, and since the gap between these values is so minute, the
discontinuity is only apparent at the atomic level.
Many aspects of quantum mechanics are counterintuitive[3] and can seem
paradoxical, because they describe behavior quite different from that seen at
larger scales. In the words of quantum physicist Richard_Feynman, quantum
mechanics deals with "nature as She is â absurd".[4] For example, the
uncertainty_principle of quantum mechanics means that the more closely one pins
down one measurement (such as the position of a particle), the less accurate
another measurement pertaining to the same particle (such as its momentum) must
become.

***** The first quantum theory: Max Planck and black-body radiation[edit] *****
Main article: Ultraviolet_catastrophe
Hot metalwork. The yellow-orange glow is the visible part of the thermal
radiation emitted due to the high temperature. Everything else in the picture
is glowing with thermal radiation as well, but less brightly and at longer
wavelengths than the human eye can detect. A far-infrared camera can observe
this radiation.
Thermal_radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted from the surface of an
object due to the object's internal energy. If an object is heated
sufficiently, it starts to emit light at the red end of the spectrum, as it
becomes red_hot.
Heating it further causes the color to change from red to yellow, white, and
blue, as it emits light at increasingly shorter wavelengths (higher
frequencies). A perfect emitter is also a perfect absorber: when it is cold,
such an object looks perfectly black, because it absorbs all the light that
falls on it and emits none. Consequently, an ideal thermal emitter is known as
a black_body, and the radiation it emits is called black-body_radiation.
Predictions of the amount of thermal radiation of different frequencies emitted
by a body. Correct values predicted by Planck's law (green) contrasted against
the classical values of Rayleigh-Jeans_law (red) and Wien_approximation (blue).
In the late 19th century, thermal radiation had been fairly well characterized
experimentally.[note_1] However, classical physics led to the RayleighâJeans
law, which, as shown in the figure, agrees with experimental results well at
low frequencies, but strongly disagrees at high frequencies. Physicists
searched for a single theory that explained all the experimental results.
The first model that was able to explain the full spectrum of thermal radiation
was put forward by Max_Planck in 1900.[5] He proposed a mathematical model in
which the thermal radiation was in equilibrium with a set of harmonic
oscillators. To reproduce the experimental results, he had to assume that each
oscillator emitted an integer number of units of energy at its single
characteristic frequency, rather than being able to emit any arbitrary amount
of energy. In other words, the energy emitted by an oscillator was quantized.
[note_2] The quantum of energy for each oscillator, according to Planck, was
proportional to the frequency of the oscillator; the constant of
proportionality is now known as the Planck_constant. The Planck constant,
usually written as h, has the value of 6.63Ã10â34 J s. So, the energy E of
an oscillator of frequency f is given by
         E = n h f ,   where   n = 1 , 2 , 3 , &#x2026;   {\displaystyle
      E=nhf,\quad {\text{where}}\quad n=1,2,3,\ldots }  [E=nhf,\quad {\text
      {where}}\quad n=1,2,3,\ldots ][6]
To change the color of such a radiating body, it is necessary to change its
temperature. Planck's_law explains why: increasing the temperature of a body
allows it to emit more energy overall, and means that a larger proportion of
the energy is towards the violet end of the spectrum.
Planck's_law was the first quantum theory in physics, and Planck won the Nobel
Prize in 1918 "in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of
Physics by his discovery of energy quanta".[7] At the time, however, Planck's
view was that quantization was purely a heuristic mathematical construct,
rather than (as is now believed) a fundamental change in our understanding of
the world.[8]
***** Photons: the quantization of light[edit] *****
Albert_Einstein c. 1905
In 1905, Albert_Einstein took an extra step. He suggested that quantization was
not just a mathematical construct, but that the energy in a beam of light
actually occurs in individual packets, which are now called photons.[9] The
energy_of_a_single_photon is given by its frequency multiplied by Planck's
constant:
         E = h f   {\displaystyle E=hf}  [E=hf]
For centuries, scientists had debated between two possible theories of light:
was it a wave or did it instead comprise a stream_of_tiny_particles? By the
19th century, the debate was generally considered to have been settled in favor
of the wave theory, as it was able to explain observed effects such as
refraction, diffraction, interference, and polarization.[10] James_Clerk
Maxwell had shown that electricity, magnetism and light are all manifestations
of the same phenomenon: the electromagnetic_field. Maxwell's_equations, which
are the complete set of laws of classical_electromagnetism, describe light as
waves: a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Because of
the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, Einstein's ideas
were met initially with great skepticism. Eventually, however, the photon model
became favored. One of the most significant pieces of evidence in its favor was
its ability to explain several puzzling properties of the photoelectric_effect,
described in the following section. Nonetheless, the wave analogy remained
indispensable for helping to understand other characteristics of light:
diffraction, refraction, and interference.
**** The photoelectric effect[edit] ****
Light (red arrows, left) is shone upon a metal. If the light frequency is high
enough (i.e. sufficient energy), electrons are ejected (blue arrows, right).
Main article: Photoelectric_effect
In 1887, Heinrich_Hertz observed that when light with sufficient frequency hits
a metallic surface, it emits electrons.[11] In 1902, Philipp_Lenard discovered
that the maximum possible energy of an ejected electron is related to the
frequency of the light, not to its intensity: if the frequency is too low, no
electrons are ejected regardless of the intensity. Strong beams of light toward
the red end of the spectrum might produce no electrical potential at all, while
weak beams of light toward the violet end of the spectrum would produce higher
and higher voltages. The lowest frequency of light that can cause electrons to
be emitted, called the threshold frequency, is different for different metals.
This observation is at odds with classical electromagnetism, which predicts
that the electron's energy should be proportional to the intensity of the
radiation.[12]:24 So when physicists first discovered devices exhibiting the
photoelectric effect, they initially expected that a higher intensity of light
would produce a higher voltage from the photoelectric device.
Einstein explained the effect by postulating that a beam of light is a stream
of particles ("photons") and that, if the beam is of frequency f, then each
photon has an energy equal to hf.[11] An electron is likely to be struck only
by a single photon, which imparts at most an energy hf to the electron.[11]
Therefore, the intensity of the beam has no effect[note_3] and only its
frequency determines the maximum energy that can be imparted to the electron.
[11]
To explain the threshold effect, Einstein argued that it takes a certain amount
of energy, called the work_function and denoted by Ï, to remove an electron
from the metal.[11] This amount of energy is different for each metal. If the
energy of the photon is less than the work function, then it does not carry
sufficient energy to remove the electron from the metal. The threshold
frequency, f0, is the frequency of a photon whose energy is equal to the work
function:
         &#x03C6; = h  f  0   .   {\displaystyle \varphi =hf_{0}.}  [\varphi
      =hf_{0}.]
If f is greater than f0, the energy hf is enough to remove an electron. The
ejected electron has a kinetic_energy, EK, which is, at most, equal to the
photon's energy minus the energy needed to dislodge the electron from the
metal:
          E  K   = h f &#x2212; &#x03C6; = h ( f &#x2212;  f  0   ) .
      {\displaystyle E_{K}=hf-\varphi =h(f-f_{0}).}  [E_{K}=hf-\varphi =h(f-f_
      {0}).]
Einstein's description of light as being composed of particles extended
Planck's notion of quantized energy, which is that a single photon of a given
frequency, f, delivers an invariant amount of energy, hf. In other words,
individual photons can deliver more or less energy, but only depending on their
frequencies. In nature, single photons are rarely encountered. The Sun and
emission sources available in the 19th century emit vast numbers of photons
every second, and so the importance of the energy carried by each individual
photon was not obvious. Einstein's idea that the energy contained in individual
units of light depends on their frequency made it possible to explain
experimental results that had seemed counterintuitive. However, although the
photon is a particle, it was still being described as having the wave-like
property of frequency. Effectively, the account of light as a particle is
insufficient, and its wave-like nature is still required.[13][note_4]
**** Consequences of light being quantized[edit] ****
The relationship between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the
energy of each individual photon is why ultraviolet light can cause sunburn,
but visible or infrared light cannot. A photon of ultraviolet light delivers a
high amount of energyâenough to contribute to cellular damage such as occurs
in a sunburn. A photon of infrared light delivers less energyâonly enough to
warm one's skin. So, an infrared lamp can warm a large surface, perhaps large
enough to keep people comfortable in a cold room, but it cannot give anyone a
sunburn.[15]
All photons of the same frequency have identical energy, and all photons of
different frequencies have proportionally (order 1, Ephoton = hf ) different
energies.[16] However, although the energy imparted by photons is invariant at
any given frequency, the initial energy state of the electrons in a
photoelectric device prior to absorption of light is not necessarily uniform.
Anomalous results may occur in the case of individual electrons. For instance,
an electron that was already excited above the equilibrium level of the
photoelectric device might be ejected when it absorbed uncharacteristically low
frequency illumination. Statistically, however, the characteristic behavior of
a photoelectric device reflects the behavior of the vast majority of its
electrons, which are at their equilibrium level. This point is helpful in
comprehending the distinction between the study of individual particles in
quantum dynamics and the study of massed particles in classical physics.

***** The quantization of matter: the Bohr model of the atom[edit] *****
By the dawn of the 20th century, evidence required a model of the atom with a
diffuse cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding a small, dense,
positively charged nucleus. These properties suggested a model in which
electrons circle around the nucleus like planets orbiting a sun.[note_5]
However, it was also known that the atom in this model would be unstable:
according to classical theory, orbiting electrons are undergoing centripetal
acceleration, and should therefore give off electromagnetic radiation, the loss
of energy also causing them to spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in
a fraction of a second.
A second, related puzzle was the emission_spectrum of atoms. When a gas is
heated, it gives off light only at discrete frequencies. For example, the
visible light given off by hydrogen consists of four different colors, as shown
in the picture below. The intensity of the light at different frequencies is
also different. By contrast, white light consists of a continuous emission
across the whole range of visible frequencies. By the end of the nineteenth
century, a simple rule known as Balmer's_formula showed how the frequencies of
the different lines related to each other, though without explaining why this
was, or making any prediction about the intensities. The formula also predicted
some additional spectral lines in ultraviolet and infrared light that had not
been observed at the time. These lines were later observed experimentally,
raising confidence in the value of the formula.
Emission_spectrum of hydrogen. When excited, hydrogen gas gives off light in
four distinct colors (spectral lines) in the visible spectrum, as well as a
number of lines in the infrared and ultraviolet.
The mathematical formula describing hydrogen's emission spectrum
In 1885 the Swiss mathematician Johann_Balmer discovered that each wavelength
Î» (lambda) in the visible spectrum of hydrogen is related to some integer n by
the equation
         &#x03BB; = B  (    n  2     n  2   &#x2212; 4    )    n = 3 , 4 , 5 ,
      6   {\displaystyle \lambda =B\left({\frac {n^{2}}{n^{2}-4}}\right)\qquad
      \qquad n=3,4,5,6}  [\lambda =B\left({\frac {n^{2}}{n^{2}-4}}\right)\qquad
      \qquad n=3,4,5,6]
where B is a constant Balmer determined is equal to 364.56 nm.
In 1888 Johannes_Rydberg generalized and greatly increased the explanatory
utility of Balmer's formula. He predicted that Î» is related to two integers n
and m according to what is now known as the Rydberg_formula:[17]
           1 &#x03BB;   = R  (    1  m  2     &#x2212;   1  n  2      )  ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\lambda }}=R\left({\frac {1}{m^{2}}}-{\frac {1}
      {n^{2}}}\right),}  [{\frac {1}{\lambda }}=R\left({\frac {1}{m^{2}}}-
      {\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\right),]
where R is the Rydberg_constant, equal to 0.0110 nmâ1, and n must be greater
than m.
Rydberg's formula accounts for the four visible wavelengths of hydrogen by
setting m = 2 and n = 3, 4, 5, 6. It also predicts additional wavelengths in
the emission spectrum: for m = 1 and for n > 1, the emission spectrum should
contain certain ultraviolet wavelengths, and for m = 3 and n > 3, it should
also contain certain infrared wavelengths. Experimental observation of these
wavelengths came two decades later: in 1908 Louis_Paschen found some of the
predicted infrared wavelengths, and in 1914 Theodore_Lyman found some of the
predicted ultraviolet wavelengths.[17]
Both Balmer and Rydberg's formulas involve integers: in modern terms, they
imply that some property of the atom is quantized. Understanding exactly what
this property was, and why it was quantized, was a major part in the
development of quantum mechanics, as shown in the rest of this article.
The Bohr_model of the atom, showing an electron transitioning from one orbit to
another by emitting a photon
In 1913 Niels_Bohr proposed a_new_model_of_the_atom that included quantized
electron orbits: electrons still orbit the nucleus much as planets orbit around
the sun, but they are permitted to inhabit only certain orbits, not to orbit at
any distance.[18] When an atom emitted (or absorbed) energy, the electron did
not move in a continuous trajectory from one orbit around the nucleus to
another, as might be expected classically. Instead, the electron would jump
instantaneously from one orbit to another, giving off the emitted light in the
form of a photon.[19] The possible energies of photons given off by each
element were determined by the differences in energy between the orbits, and so
the emission spectrum for each element would contain a number of lines.[20]
[Head_and_shoulders_of_young_man_in_a_suit_and_tie]
Niels Bohr as a young man
Starting from only one simple assumption about the rule that the orbits must
obey, the Bohr model was able to relate the observed spectral lines in the
emission spectrum of hydrogen to previously known constants. In Bohr's model
the electron was not allowed to emit energy continuously and crash into the
nucleus: once it was in the closest permitted orbit, it was stable forever.
Bohr's model didn't explain why the orbits should be quantized in that way, nor
was it able to make accurate predictions for atoms with more than one electron,
or to explain why some spectral lines are brighter than others.
Some fundamental assumptions of the Bohr model were soon proven wrongâbut the
key result that the discrete lines in emission spectra are due to some property
of the electrons in atoms being quantized is correct. The way that the
electrons actually behave is strikingly different from Bohr's atom, and from
what we see in the world of our everyday experience; this modern quantum
mechanical model of the atom is discussed below.
A more detailed explanation of the Bohr model
Bohr theorized that the angular_momentum, L, of an electron is quantized:
         L = n   h  2 &#x03C0;    = n &#x210F;   {\displaystyle L=n{\frac {h}
      {2\pi }}=n\hbar }  [{\displaystyle L=n{\frac {h}{2\pi }}=n\hbar }]
where n is an integer and h is the Planck constant. Starting from this
assumption, Coulomb's_law and the equations of circular_motion show that an
electron with n units of angular momentum orbit a proton at a distance r given
by
         r =     n  2    h  2     4  &#x03C0;  2    k  e   m  e  2
      {\displaystyle r={\frac {n^{2}h^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}k_{e}me^{2}}}}  [r={\frac
      {n^{2}h^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}k_{e}me^{2}}}],
where ke is the Coulomb_constant, m is the mass of an electron, and e is the
charge_on_an_electron. For simplicity this is written as
         r =  n  2    a  0   ,    {\displaystyle r=n^{2}a_{0},\!}  [r=n^{2}a_
      {0},\!]
where a0, called the Bohr_radius, is equal to 0.0529 nm. The Bohr radius is the
radius of the smallest allowed orbit.
The energy of the electron[note_6] can also be calculated, and is given by
         E = &#x2212;     k   e     e  2     2  a  0        1  n  2
      {\displaystyle E=-{\frac {k_{\mathrm {e} }e^{2}}{2a_{0}}}{\frac {1}{n^
      {2}}}}  [E=-{\frac {k_{\mathrm {e} }e^{2}}{2a_{0}}}{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}].
Thus Bohr's assumption that angular momentum is quantized means that an
electron can inhabit only certain orbits around the nucleus, and that it can
have only certain energies. A consequence of these constraints is that the
electron does not crash into the nucleus: it cannot continuously emit energy,
and it cannot come closer to the nucleus than a0 (the Bohr radius).
An electron loses energy by jumping instantaneously from its original orbit to
a lower orbit; the extra energy is emitted in the form of a photon. Conversely,
an electron that absorbs a photon gains energy, hence it jumps to an orbit that
is farther from the nucleus.
Each photon from glowing atomic hydrogen is due to an electron moving from a
higher orbit, with radius rn, to a lower orbit, rm. The energy EÎ³ of this
photon is the difference in the energies En and Em of the electron:
          E  &#x03B3;   =  E  n   &#x2212;  E  m   =     k   e     e  2     2
      a  0       (    1  m  2     &#x2212;   1  n  2      )    {\displaystyle
      E_{\gamma }=E_{n}-E_{m}={\frac {k_{\mathrm {e} }e^{2}}{2a_{0}}}\left(
      {\frac {1}{m^{2}}}-{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\right)}  [E_{\gamma }=E_{n}-E_{m}=
      {\frac {k_{\mathrm {e} }e^{2}}{2a_{0}}}\left({\frac {1}{m^{2}}}-{\frac
      {1}{n^{2}}}\right)]
Since Planck's equation shows that the photon's energy is related to its
wavelength by EÎ³ = hc/Î», the wavelengths of light that can be emitted are
given by
           1 &#x03BB;   =     k   e     e  2     2  a  0   h c     (    1  m  2
      &#x2212;   1  n  2      )  .   {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\lambda }}=
      {\frac {k_{\mathrm {e} }e^{2}}{2a_{0}hc}}\left({\frac {1}{m^{2}}}-{\frac
      {1}{n^{2}}}\right).}  [{\frac {1}{\lambda }}={\frac {k_{\mathrm {e} }e^
      {2}}{2a_{0}hc}}\left({\frac {1}{m^{2}}}-{\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\right).]
This equation has the same form as the Rydberg formula, and predicts that the
constant R should be given by
         R =     k   e     e  2     2  a  0   h c    .   {\displaystyle R=
      {\frac {k_{\mathrm {e} }e^{2}}{2a_{0}hc}}.}  [R={\frac {k_{\mathrm {e}
      }e^{2}}{2a_{0}hc}}.]
Therefore, the Bohr model of the atom can predict the emission spectrum of
hydrogen in terms of fundamental constants.[note_7] However, it was not able to
make accurate predictions for multi-electron atoms, or to explain why some
spectral lines are brighter than others.
***** Waveâparticle duality[edit] *****
Main article: Waveâparticle_duality
Louis_de_Broglie in 1929. De Broglie won the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics for his
prediction that matter acts as a wave, made in his 1924 PhD thesis.
Just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, matter_also_has
wave-like_properties.[21]
Matter behaving as a wave was first demonstrated experimentally for electrons:
a beam of electrons can exhibit diffraction, just like a beam of light or a
water wave.[note_8] Similar wave-like phenomena were later shown for atoms and
even molecules.
The wavelength, Î», associated with any object is related to its momentum, p,
through the Planck_constant, h:[22][23]
         p =   h &#x03BB;   .   {\displaystyle p={\frac {h}{\lambda }}.}  [p=
      {\frac {h}{\lambda }}.]
The relationship, called the de Broglie hypothesis, holds for all types of
matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.
The concept of waveâparticle duality says that neither the classical concept
of "particle" nor of "wave" can fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale
objects, either photons or matter. Waveâparticle duality is an example of the
principle_of_complementarity in quantum physics.[24][25][26][27][28] An elegant
example of waveâparticle duality, the double slit experiment, is discussed in
the section below.
**** The double-slit experiment[edit] ****
Main article: Double-slit_experiment
The diffraction pattern produced when light is shone through one slit (top) and
the interference pattern produced by two slits (bottom). The much more complex
pattern from two slits, with its small-scale interference fringes, demonstrates
the wave-like propagation of light.
[File:Wave-particle duality.ogv]Play_media
The double slit experiment for a classical particle, a wave, and a quantum
particle demonstrating wave-particle duality
In the double-slit experiment, as originally performed by Thomas_Young and
Augustin_Fresnel in 1827, a beam of light is directed through two narrow,
closely spaced slits, producing an interference_pattern of light and dark bands
on a screen. If one of the slits is covered up, one might naÃ¯vely expect that
the intensity of the fringes due to interference would be halved everywhere. In
fact, a much simpler pattern is seen, a simple diffraction_pattern. Closing one
slit results in a much simpler pattern diametrically opposite the open slit.
Exactly the same behavior can be demonstrated in water waves, and so the
double-slit experiment was seen as a demonstration of the wave nature of light.
Variations of the double-slit experiment have been performed using electrons,
atoms, and even large molecules,[29][30] and the same type of interference
pattern is seen. Thus it has been demonstrated that all matter possesses both
particle and wave characteristics.
Even if the source intensity is turned down, so that only one particle (e.g.
photon or electron) is passing through the apparatus at a time, the same
interference pattern develops over time. The quantum particle acts as a wave
when passing through the double slits, but as a particle when it is detected.
This is a typical feature of quantum complementarity: a quantum particle acts
as a wave in an experiment to measure its wave-like properties, and like a
particle in an experiment to measure its particle-like properties. The point on
the detector screen where any individual particle shows up is the result of a
random process. However, the distribution pattern of many individual particles
mimics the diffraction pattern produced by waves.
**** Application to the Bohr model[edit] ****
De Broglie expanded the Bohr_model_of_the_atom by showing that an electron in
orbit around a nucleus could be thought of as having wave-like properties. In
particular, an electron is observed only in situations that permit a standing
wave around a nucleus. An example of a standing wave is a violin string, which
is fixed at both ends and can be made to vibrate. The waves created by a
stringed instrument appear to oscillate in place, moving from crest to trough
in an up-and-down motion. The wavelength of a standing wave is related to the
length of the vibrating object and the boundary conditions. For example,
because the violin string is fixed at both ends, it can carry standing waves of
wavelengths        2 l  n     {\displaystyle {\frac {2l}{n}}}  [{\displaystyle
{\frac {2l}{n}}}], where l is the length and n is a positive integer. De
Broglie suggested that the allowed electron orbits were those for which the
circumference of the orbit would be an integer number of wavelengths. The
electron's wavelength therefore determines that only Bohr orbits of certain
distances from the nucleus are possible. In turn, at any distance from the
nucleus smaller than a certain value it would be impossible to establish an
orbit. The minimum possible distance from the nucleus is called the Bohr
radius.[31]
De Broglie's treatment of quantum events served as a starting point for
SchrÃ¶dinger when he set out to construct a wave equation to describe quantum
theoretical events.
***** Spin[edit] *****
Main article: Spin_(physics)
See also: SternâGerlach_experiment
[File:Quantum spin and the Stern-Gerlach experiment.ogv]Play_media
Quantum spin versus classical magnet in the SternâGerlach_experiment
In 1922, Otto_Stern and Walther_Gerlach shot silver atoms through an
inhomogeneous magnetic_field. In classical mechanics, a magnet thrown through a
magnetic field may be, depending on its orientation (if it is pointing with its
northern pole upwards or down, or somewhere in between), deflected a small or
large distance upwards or downwards. The atoms that Stern and Gerlach shot
through the magnetic field acted in a similar way. However, while the magnets
could be deflected variable distances, the atoms would always be deflected a
constant distance either up or down. This implied that the property of the atom
that corresponds to the magnet's orientation must be quantized, taking one of
two values (either up or down), as opposed to being chosen freely from any
angle.
Ralph_Kronig originated the theory that particles such as atoms or electrons
behave as if they rotate, or "spin", about an axis. Spin would account for the
missing magnetic_moment,[clarification_needed] and allow two electrons in the
same orbital to occupy distinct quantum_states if they "spun" in opposite
directions, thus satisfying the exclusion_principle. The quantum number
represented the sense (positive or negative) of spin.
The choice of orientation of the magnetic field used in the SternâGerlach
experiment is arbitrary. In the animation shown here, the field is vertical and
so the atoms are deflected either up or down. If the magnet is rotated a
quarter turn, the atoms are deflected either left or right. Using a vertical
field shows that the spin along the vertical axis is quantized, and using a
horizontal field shows that the spin along the horizontal axis is quantized.
If, instead of hitting a detector screen, one of the beams of atoms coming out
of the SternâGerlach apparatus is passed into another (inhomogeneous)
magnetic field oriented in the same direction, all of the atoms are deflected
the same way in this second field. However, if the second field is oriented at
90Â° to the first, then half of the atoms are deflected one way and half the
other, so that the atom's spin about the horizontal and vertical axes are
independent of each other. However, if one of these beams (e.g. the atoms that
were deflected up then left) is passed into a third magnetic field, oriented
the same way as the first, half of the atoms go one way and half the other,
even though they all went in the same direction originally. The action of
measuring the atoms' spin with respect to a horizontal field has changed their
spin with respect to a vertical field.
The SternâGerlach experiment demonstrates a number of important features of
quantum mechanics:
    * A feature of the natural world has been demonstrated to be quantized, and
      able to take only certain discrete values.
    * Particles possess an intrinsic angular_momentum that is closely analogous
      to the angular momentum of a classically spinning object.
    * Measurement changes the system being measured in quantum mechanics. Only
      the spin of an object in one direction can be known, and observing the
      spin in another direction destroys the original information about the
      spin.
    * Quantum mechanics is probabilistic: whether the spin of any individual
      atom sent into the apparatus is positive or negative is random.
***** Development of modern quantum mechanics[edit] *****
In 1925, Werner_Heisenberg attempted to solve one of the problems that the Bohr
model left unanswered, explaining the intensities of the different lines in the
hydrogen emission spectrum. Through a series of mathematical analogies, he
wrote out the quantum-mechanical analog for the classical computation of
intensities.[32] Shortly afterwards, Heisenberg's colleague Max_Born realised
that Heisenberg's method of calculating the probabilities for transitions
between the different energy levels could best be expressed by using the
mathematical concept of matrices.[note_9]
In the same year, building on de Broglie's hypothesis, Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger
developed the equation that describes the behavior of a quantum-mechanical
wave.[33] The mathematical model, called the SchrÃ¶dinger_equation after its
creator, is central to quantum mechanics, defines the permitted stationary
states of a quantum system, and describes how the quantum state of a physical
system changes in time.[34] The wave itself is described by a mathematical
function known as a "wave_function". SchrÃ¶dinger said that the wave function
provides the "means for predicting probability of measurement results".[35]
SchrÃ¶dinger was able to calculate the energy levels of hydrogen by treating a
hydrogen atom's electron as a classical wave, moving in a well of electrical
potential created by the proton. This calculation accurately reproduced the
energy levels of the Bohr model.
In May 1926, SchrÃ¶dinger proved that Heisenberg's matrix_mechanics and his own
wave_mechanics made the same predictions about the properties and behavior of
the electron; mathematically, the two theories had an underlying common form.
Yet the two men disagreed on the interpretation of their mutual theory. For
instance, Heisenberg accepted the theoretical prediction of jumps of electrons
between orbitals in an atom,[36] but SchrÃ¶dinger hoped that a theory based on
continuous wave-like properties could avoid what he called (as paraphrased by
Wilhelm_Wien) "this nonsense about quantum jumps".[37]
***** Copenhagen interpretation[edit] *****
Main article: Copenhagen_interpretation
[A_block_shaped_beige_building_with_a_sloped,_red_tiled_roof]
The Niels_Bohr_Institute in Copenhagen, which was a focal point for researchers
in quantum mechanics and related subjects in the 1920s and 1930s. Most of the
world's best known theoretical physicists spent time there.
Bohr, Heisenberg, and others tried to explain what these experimental results
and mathematical models really mean. Their description, known as the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics, aimed to describe the nature of reality
that was being probed by the measurements and described by the mathematical
formulations of quantum mechanics.
The main principles of the Copenhagen interpretation are:
   1. A system is completely described by a wave_function, usually represented
      by the Greek letter     &#x03C8;   {\displaystyle \psi }  [\psi ]
      ("psi"). (Heisenberg)
   2. How     &#x03C8;   {\displaystyle \psi }  [\psi ] changes over time is
      given by the SchrÃ¶dinger equation.
   3. The description of nature is essentially probabilistic. The probability
      of an event â for example, where on the screen a particle shows up in
      the double-slit experiment â is related to the square of the absolute
      value of the amplitude of its wave function. (Born_rule, due to Max_Born,
      which gives a physical meaning to the wave function in the Copenhagen
      interpretation: the probability_amplitude)
   4. It is not possible to know the values of all of the properties of the
      system at the same time; those properties that are not known with
      precision must be described by probabilities. (Heisenberg's uncertainty
      principle)
   5. Matter, like energy, exhibits a waveâparticle duality. An experiment
      can demonstrate the particle-like properties of matter, or its wave-like
      properties; but not both at the same time. (Complementarity_principle due
      to Bohr)
   6. Measuring devices are essentially classical devices, and measure
      classical properties such as position and momentum.[38]
   7. The quantum mechanical description of large systems should closely
      approximate the classical description. (Correspondence_principle of Bohr
      and Heisenberg)
Various consequences of these principles are discussed in more detail in the
following subsections.
**** Uncertainty principle[edit] ****
Main article: Uncertainty_principle
Werner_Heisenberg at the age of 26. Heisenberg won the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics
in 1932 for the work that he did at around this time.[39]
Suppose it is desired to measure the position and speed of an object â for
example a car going through a radar speed trap. It can be assumed that the car
has a definite position and speed at a particular moment in time. How
accurately these values can be measured depends on the quality of the measuring
equipment. If the precision of the measuring equipment is improved, it provides
a result closer to the true value. It might be assumed that the speed of the
car and its position could be operationally defined and measured
simultaneously, as precisely as might be desired.
In 1927, Heisenberg proved that this last assumption is not correct.[40]
Quantum mechanics shows that certain pairs of physical properties, for example
position and speed, cannot be simultaneously measured, nor defined in
operational terms, to arbitrary precision: the more precisely one property is
measured, or defined in operational terms, the less precisely can the other.
This statement is known as the uncertainty_principle. The uncertainty principle
is not only a statement about the accuracy of our measuring equipment, but,
more deeply, is about the conceptual nature of the measured quantities â the
assumption that the car had simultaneously defined position and speed does not
work in quantum mechanics. On a scale of cars and people, these uncertainties
are negligible, but when dealing with atoms and electrons they become critical.
[41]
Heisenberg gave, as an illustration, the measurement of the position and
momentum of an electron using a photon of light. In measuring the electron's
position, the higher the frequency of the photon, the more accurate is the
measurement of the position of the impact of the photon with the electron, but
the greater is the disturbance of the electron. This is because from the impact
with the photon, the electron absorbs a random amount of energy, rendering the
measurement obtained of its momentum increasingly uncertain (momentum is
velocity multiplied by mass), for one is necessarily measuring its post-impact
disturbed momentum from the collision products and not its original momentum.
With a photon of lower frequency, the disturbance (and hence uncertainty) in
the momentum is less, but so is the accuracy of the measurement of the position
of the impact.[42]
The uncertainty principle shows mathematically that the product of the
uncertainty in the position and momentum of a particle (momentum is velocity
multiplied by mass) could never be less than a certain value, and that this
value is related to Planck's_constant.
**** Wave function collapse[edit] ****
Main article: Wave_function_collapse
Wave function collapse is a forced expression for whatever just happened when
it becomes appropriate to replace the description of an uncertain state of a
system by a description of the system in a definite state. Explanations for the
nature of the process of becoming certain are controversial. At any time before
a photon "shows up" on a detection screen it can be described only with a set
of probabilities for where it might show up. When it does show up, for instance
in the CCD of an electronic camera, the time and the space where it interacted
with the device are known within very tight limits. However, the photon has
disappeared, and the wave function has disappeared with it. In its place some
physical change in the detection screen has appeared, e.g., an exposed spot in
a sheet of photographic film, or a change in electric potential in some cell of
a CCD.
**** Eigenstates and eigenvalues[edit] ****
      For a more detailed introduction to this subject, see: Introduction_to
      eigenstates
Because of the uncertainty_principle, statements about both the position and
momentum of particles can assign only a probability that the position or
momentum has some numerical value. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate
clearly the difference between the state of something that is indeterminate,
such as an electron in a probability cloud, and the state of something having a
definite value. When an object can definitely be "pinned-down" in some respect,
it is said to possess an eigenstate.
In the SternâGerlach experiment discussed above, the spin of the atom about
the vertical axis has two eigenstates: up and down. Before measuring it, we can
only say that any individual atom has equal probability of being found to have
spin up or spin down. The measurement process causes the wavefunction to
collapse into one of the two states.
The eigenstates of spin about the vertical axis are not simultaneously
eigenstates of spin about the horizontal axis, so this atom has equal
probability of being found to have either value of spin about the horizontal
axis. As described in the section above, measuring the spin about the
horizontal axis can allow an atom that was spun up to spin down: measuring its
spin about the horizontal axis collapses its wave function into one of the
eigenstates of this measurement, which means it is no longer in an eigenstate
of spin about the vertical axis, so can take either value.
**** The Pauli exclusion principle[edit] ****
Wolfgang_Pauli
Main article: Pauli_exclusion_principle
In 1924, Wolfgang_Pauli proposed a new quantum degree of freedom (or quantum
number), with two possible values, to resolve inconsistencies between observed
molecular spectra and the predictions of quantum mechanics. In particular, the
spectrum_of_atomic_hydrogen had a doublet, or pair of lines differing by a
small amount, where only one line was expected. Pauli formulated his exclusion
principle, stating, "There cannot exist an atom in such a quantum state that
two electrons within [it] have the same set of quantum numbers."[43]
A year later, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit identified Pauli's new degree of freedom
with the property called spin whose effects were observed in the
SternâGerlach experiment.
**** Application to the hydrogen atom[edit] ****
Main article: Atomic_orbital_model
Bohr's model of the atom was essentially a planetary one, with the electrons
orbiting around the nuclear "sun". However, the uncertainty principle states
that an electron cannot simultaneously have an exact location and velocity in
the way that a planet does. Instead of classical orbits, electrons are said to
inhabit atomic_orbitals. An orbital is the "cloud" of possible locations in
which an electron might be found, a distribution of probabilities rather than a
precise location.[43] Each orbital is three dimensional, rather than the two
dimensional orbit, and is often depicted as a three-dimensional region within
which there is a 95 percent probability of finding the electron.[44]
SchrÃ¶dinger was able to calculate the energy levels of hydrogen by treating a
hydrogen atom's electron as a wave, represented by the "wave_function" Î¨, in
an electric_potential well, V, created by the proton. The solutions to
SchrÃ¶dinger's equation are distributions of probabilities for electron
positions and locations. Orbitals have a range of different shapes in three
dimensions. The energies of the different orbitals can be calculated, and they
accurately match the energy levels of the Bohr model.
Within SchrÃ¶dinger's picture, each electron has four properties:
   1. An "orbital" designation, indicating whether the particle wave is one
      that is closer to the nucleus with less energy or one that is farther
      from the nucleus with more energy;
   2. The "shape" of the orbital, spherical or otherwise;
   3. The "inclination" of the orbital, determining the magnetic_moment of the
      orbital around the z-axis.
   4. The "spin" of the electron.
The collective name for these properties is the quantum_state of the electron.
The quantum state can be described by giving a number to each of these
properties; these are known as the electron's quantum_numbers. The quantum
state of the electron is described by its wave function. The Pauli exclusion
principle demands that no two electrons within an atom may have the same values
of all four numbers.
The shapes of atomic orbitals. Rows: 1s, 2p, 3d and 4f. From left to right
m = &#x2212; l , &#x2026; , l   {\displaystyle m=-l,\ldots ,l}  [{\displaystyle
m=-l,\ldots ,l}]. The colors show the phase of the wave function.
The first property describing the orbital is the principal_quantum_number, n,
which is the same as in Bohr's model. n denotes the energy level of each
orbital. The possible values for n are integers:
         n = 1 , 2 , 3 &#x2026;   {\displaystyle n=1,2,3\ldots }
      [n=1,2,3\ldots ]
The next quantum number, the azimuthal_quantum_number, denoted l, describes the
shape of the orbital. The shape is a consequence of the angular_momentum of the
orbital. The angular momentum represents the resistance of a spinning object to
speeding up or slowing down under the influence of external force. The
azimuthal quantum number represents the orbital angular momentum of an electron
around its nucleus. The possible values for l are integers from 0 to n â 1
(where n is the principal quantum number of the electron):
         l = 0 , 1 , &#x2026; , n &#x2212; 1.   {\displaystyle l=0,1,\ldots ,n-
      1.}  [l=0,1,\ldots ,n-1.]
The shape of each orbital is usually referred to by a letter, rather than by
its azimuthal quantum number. The first shape (l=0) is denoted by the letter s
(a mnemonic being "sphere"). The next shape is denoted by the letter p and has
the form of a dumbbell. The other orbitals have more complicated shapes (see
atomic_orbital), and are denoted by the letters d, f, g, etc.
The third quantum number, the magnetic_quantum_number, describes the magnetic
moment of the electron, and is denoted by ml (or simply m). The possible values
for ml are integers from âl to l (where l is the azimuthal quantum number of
the electron):
          m  l   = &#x2212; l , &#x2212; ( l &#x2212; 1 ) , &#x2026; , 0 , 1 ,
      &#x2026; , l .   {\displaystyle m_{l}=-l,-(l-1),\ldots ,0,1,\ldots ,l.}
      [m_{l}=-l,-(l-1),\ldots ,0,1,\ldots ,l.]
The magnetic quantum number measures the component of the angular momentum in a
particular direction. The choice of direction is arbitrary; conventionally the
z-direction is chosen.
The fourth quantum number, the spin_quantum_number (pertaining to the
"orientation" of the electron's spin) is denoted ms, with values +&#x200b;1⁄2
or â&#x200b;1⁄2.
The chemist Linus_Pauling wrote, by way of example:
     In the case of a helium atom with two electrons in the 1s orbital,
     the Pauli Exclusion Principle requires that the two electrons differ
     in the value of one quantum number. Their values of n, l, and ml are
     the same. Accordingly they must differ in the value of ms, which can
     have the value of +&#x200b;1⁄2 for one electron and â&#x200b;1⁄2
     for the other."[43]
It is the underlying structure and symmetry of atomic orbitals, and the way
that electrons fill them, that leads to the organisation of the periodic_table.
The way the atomic orbitals on different atoms combine to form molecular
orbitals determines the structure and strength of chemical bonds between atoms.
***** Dirac wave equation[edit] *****
Main article: Dirac_equation
Paul_Dirac (1902â1984)
In 1928, Paul_Dirac extended the Pauli_equation, which described spinning
electrons, to account for special_relativity. The result was a theory that
dealt properly with events, such as the speed at which an electron orbits the
nucleus, occurring at a substantial fraction of the speed_of_light. By using
the simplest electromagnetic_interaction, Dirac was able to predict the value
of the magnetic moment associated with the electron's spin, and found the
experimentally observed value, which was too large to be that of a spinning
charged sphere governed by classical_physics. He was able to solve for the
spectral_lines_of_the_hydrogen_atom, and to reproduce from physical first
principles Sommerfeld's successful formula for the fine_structure of the
hydrogen spectrum.
Dirac's equations sometimes yielded a negative value for energy, for which he
proposed a novel solution: he posited the existence of an antielectron and of a
dynamical vacuum. This led to the many-particle quantum_field_theory.
***** Quantum entanglement[edit] *****
Main article: Quantum_entanglement
Superposition of two quantum characteristics, and two resolution possibilities.
The Pauli exclusion principle says that two electrons in one system cannot be
in the same state. Nature leaves open the possibility, however, that two
electrons can have both states "superimposed" over each of them. Recall that
the wave functions that emerge simultaneously from the double slits arrive at
the detection screen in a state of superposition. Nothing is certain until the
superimposed waveforms "collapse". At that instant an electron shows up
somewhere in accordance with the probability that is the square of the absolute
value of the sum of the complex-valued amplitudes of the two superimposed
waveforms. The situation there is already very abstract. A concrete way of
thinking about entangled photons, photons in which two contrary states are
superimposed on each of them in the same event, is as follows:
Imagine that the superposition of a state labeled blue, and another state
labeled red then appear (in imagination) as a purple state. Two photons are
produced as the result of the same atomic event. Perhaps they are produced by
the excitation of a crystal that characteristically absorbs a photon of a
certain frequency and emits two photons of half the original frequency. So the
two photons come out purple. If the experimenter now performs some experiment
that determines whether one of the photons is either blue or red, then that
experiment changes the photon involved from one having a superposition of blue
and red characteristics to a photon that has only one of those characteristics.
The problem that Einstein had with such an imagined situation was that if one
of these photons had been kept bouncing between mirrors in a laboratory on
earth, and the other one had traveled halfway to the nearest star, when its
twin was made to reveal itself as either blue or red, that meant that the
distant photon now had to lose its purple status too. So whenever it might be
investigated after its twin had been measured, it would necessarily show up in
the opposite state to whatever its twin had revealed.
In trying to show that quantum mechanics was not a complete theory, Einstein
started with the theory's prediction that two or more particles that have
interacted in the past can appear strongly correlated when their various
properties are later measured. He sought to explain this seeming interaction in
a classical way, through their common past, and preferably not by some "spooky
action at a distance". The argument is worked out in a famous paper, Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen (1935; abbreviated EPR), setting out what is now called the
EPR_paradox. Assuming what is now usually called local_realism, EPR attempted
to show from quantum theory that a particle has both position and momentum
simultaneously, while according to the Copenhagen_interpretation, only one of
those two properties actually exists and only at the moment that it is being
measured. EPR concluded that quantum theory is incomplete in that it refuses to
consider physical properties that objectively exist in nature. (Einstein,
Podolsky, & Rosen 1935 is currently Einstein's most cited publication in
physics journals.) In the same year, Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger used the word
"entanglement" and declared: "I would not call that one but rather the
characteristic trait of quantum mechanics."[45] The question of whether
entanglement is a real condition is still in dispute.[46] The Bell_inequalities
are the most powerful challenge to Einstein's claims.
***** Quantum field theory[edit] *****
Main article: Quantum_field_theory
The idea of quantum field theory began in the late 1920s with British physicist
Paul_Dirac, when he attempted to quantize the electromagnetic_field â a
procedure for constructing a quantum theory starting from a classical theory.
Merriam-Webster defines a field in physics as "a region or space in which a
given effect (such as magnetism) exists".[47] Other effects that manifest
themselves as fields are gravitation and static_electricity.[48] In 2008,
physicist Richard_Hammond wrote:
     Sometimes we distinguish between quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum
     field theory (QFT). QM refers to a system in which the number of
     particles is fixed, and the fields (such as the electromechanical
     field) are continuous classical entities. QFT ... goes a step further
     and allows for the creation and annihilation of particles ...
He added, however, that quantum mechanics is often used to refer to "the entire
notion of quantum view".[49]:108
In 1931, Dirac proposed the existence of particles that later became known as
antimatter.[50] Dirac shared the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics for 1933 with
SchrÃ¶dinger "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic_theory".[51]
On its face, quantum field theory allows infinite numbers of particles, and
leaves it up to the theory itself to predict how many and with which
probabilities or numbers they should exist. When developed further, the theory
often contradicts observation, so that its creation and annihilation operators
can be empirically tied down.[clarification_needed] Furthermore, empirical
conservation laws such as that of massâenergy suggest certain constraints on
the mathematical form of the theory, which are mathematically speaking finicky.
The latter fact makes quantum field theories difficult to handle, but has also
led to further restrictions on admissible forms of the theory; the
complications are mentioned below under the rubric of renormalization.
***** Quantum electrodynamics[edit] *****
Main article: Quantum_electrodynamics
Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the name of the quantum theory of the
electromagnetic_force. Understanding QED begins with understanding
electromagnetism. Electromagnetism can be called "electrodynamics" because it
is a dynamic interaction between electrical and magnetic_forces.
Electromagnetism begins with the electric_charge.
Electric charges are the sources of, and create, electric_fields. An electric
field is a field that exerts a force on any particles that carry electric
charges, at any point in space. This includes the electron, proton, and even
quarks, among others. As a force is exerted, electric charges move, a current
flows, and a magnetic field is produced. The changing magnetic field, in turn,
causes electric_current (often moving electrons). The physical description of
interacting charged_particles, electrical currents, electrical fields, and
magnetic fields is called electromagnetism.
In 1928 Paul_Dirac produced a relativistic quantum theory of electromagnetism.
This was the progenitor to modern quantum electrodynamics, in that it had
essential ingredients of the modern theory. However, the problem of unsolvable
infinities developed in this relativistic_quantum_theory. Years later,
renormalization largely solved this problem. Initially viewed as a suspect,
provisional procedure by some of its originators, renormalization eventually
was embraced as an important and self-consistent tool in QED and other fields
of physics. Also, in the late 1940s Feynman's_diagrams depicted all possible
interactions pertaining to a given event. The diagrams showed in particular
that the electromagnetic force is the exchange of photons between interacting
particles.[52]
The Lamb_shift is an example of a quantum electrodynamics prediction that has
been experimentally verified. It is an effect whereby the quantum nature of the
electromagnetic field makes the energy levels in an atom or ion deviate
slightly from what they would otherwise be. As a result, spectral lines may
shift or split.
Similarly, within a freely propagating electromagnetic wave, the current can
also be just an abstract displacement_current, instead of involving charge
carriers. In QED, its full description makes essential use of short lived
virtual_particles. There, QED again validates an earlier, rather mysterious
concept.
***** Standard Model[edit] *****
Main article: Standard_Model
In the 1960s physicists realized that QED broke down at extremely high
energies.[citation_needed] From this inconsistency the Standard_Model of
particle physics was discovered, which remedied the higher energy breakdown in
theory. It is another extended quantum field theory that unifies the
electromagnetic and weak_interactions into one theory. This is called the
electroweak_theory.
Additionally the Standard Model contains[citation_needed] a high energy
unification of the electroweak theory with the strong_force, described by
quantum_chromodynamics. It also postulates a connection with gravity as yet
another gauge_theory, but the connection is as of 2015 still poorly understood.
The theory's successful prediction of the Higgs_particle to explain inertial
mass was confirmed by the Large_Hadron_Collider,[53] and thus the Standard
model is now considered the basic and more or less complete description of
particle_physics as we know it.
***** Interpretations[edit] *****
Main article: Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics
The physical measurements, equations, and predictions pertinent to quantum
mechanics are all consistent and hold a very high level of confirmation.
However, the question of what these abstract models say about the underlying
nature of the real world has received competing answers. These interpretations
are widely varying and sometimes somewhat abstract. For instance, the
Copenhagen_interpretation states that before a measurement, statements about a
particles' properties are completely meaningless, while in the Many-worlds
interpretation describes the existence of a multiverse made up of every
possible universe.[54]
***** Applications[edit] *****
Main article: Quantum_mechanics:_applications
Applications of quantum mechanics include the laser, the transistor, the
electron_microscope, and magnetic_resonance_imaging. A special class of quantum
mechanical applications is related to macroscopic_quantum_phenomena such as
superfluid helium and superconductors. The study of semiconductors led to the
invention of the diode and the transistor, which are indispensable for modern
electronics.
In even the simple light_switch, quantum_tunnelling is absolutely vital, as
otherwise the electrons in the electric_current could not penetrate the
potential barrier made up of a layer of oxide. Flash_memory chips found in USB
drives also use quantum tunnelling, to erase their memory cells.[55]

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ A number of formulae had been created that could describe some of the
      experimental measurements of thermal radiation: how the wavelength at
      which the radiation is strongest changes with temperature is given by
      Wien's_displacement_law, the overall power emitted per unit area is given
      by the StefanâBoltzmann_law. The best theoretical explanation of the
      experimental results was the RayleighâJeans_law, which agrees with
      experimental results well at large wavelengths (or, equivalently, low
      frequencies), but strongly disagrees at short wavelengths (or high
      frequencies). In fact, at short wavelengths, classical physics predicted
      that energy will be emitted by a hot body at an infinite rate. This
      result, which is clearly wrong, is known as the ultraviolet_catastrophe.
   2. ^ The word quantum comes from the Latin_word for "how much" (as does
      quantity). Something that is quantized, like the energy of Planck's
      harmonic oscillators, can only take specific values. For example, in most
      countries money is effectively quantized, with the quantum of money being
      the lowest-value coin in circulation. Mechanics is the branch of science
      that deals with the action of forces on objects. So, quantum mechanics is
      the part of mechanics that deals with objects for which particular
      properties are quantized.
   3. ^ Actually, there can be intensity-dependent effects, but at intensities
      achievable with non-laser sources, these effects are unobservable.
   4. ^ Einstein's photoelectric effect equation can be derived and explained
      without requiring the concept of "photons". That is, the electromagnetic
      radiation can be treated as a classical electromagnetic wave, as long as
      the electrons in the material are treated by the laws of quantum
      mechanics. The results are quantitatively correct for thermal light
      sources (the sun, incandescent lamps, etc) both for the rate of electron
      emission as well as their angular distribution. For more on this point,
      see [14]
   5. ^ The classical model of the atom is called the planetary model, or
      sometimes the Rutherford_modelâafter Ernest_Rutherford who proposed it
      in 1911, based on the GeigerâMarsden_gold_foil_experiment, which first
      demonstrated the existence of the nucleus.
   6. ^ In this case, the energy of the electron is the sum of its kinetic and
      potential energies. The electron has kinetic energy by virtue of its
      actual motion around the nucleus, and potential energy because of its
      electromagnetic interaction with the nucleus.
   7. ^ The model can be easily modified to account for the emission spectrum
      of any system consisting of a nucleus and a single electron (that is,
      ions such as He+ or O7+, which contain only one electron) but cannot be
      extended to an atom with two electrons such as neutral helium.
   8. ^ Electron diffraction was first demonstrated three years after de
      Broglie published his hypothesis. At the University_of_Aberdeen, George
      Thomson passed a beam of electrons through a thin metal film and observed
      diffraction patterns, as would be predicted by the de Broglie hypothesis.
      At Bell_Labs, Davisson and Germer guided_an_electron_beam_through_a
      crystalline_grid. De Broglie was awarded the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics in
      1929 for his hypothesis; Thomson and Davisson shared the Nobel Prize for
      Physics in 1937 for their experimental work.
   9. ^ For a somewhat more sophisticated look at how Heisenberg transitioned
      from the old quantum theory and classical physics to the new quantum
      mechanics, see Heisenberg's_entryway_to_matrix_mechanics.
