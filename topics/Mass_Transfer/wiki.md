Mass transfer is the net movement of mass from one location, usually meaning
stream, phase, fraction or component, to another. Mass transfer occurs in many
processes, such as absorption, evaporation, drying, precipitation, membrane
filtration, and distillation. Mass transfer is used by different scientific
disciplines for different processes and mechanisms. The phrase is commonly used
in engineering for physical processes that involve diffusive and convective
transport of chemical_species within physical_systems.
Some common examples of mass transfer processes are the evaporation of water
from a pond to the atmosphere, the purification of blood in the kidneys and
liver, and the distillation of alcohol. In industrial processes, mass transfer
operations include separation of chemical components in distillation columns,
absorbers such as scrubbers or stripping, adsorbers such as activated carbon
beds, and liquid-liquid_extraction. Mass transfer is often coupled to
additional transport_processes, for instance in industrial cooling_towers.
These towers couple heat transfer to mass transfer by allowing hot water to
flow in contact with air. The water is cooled by expelling some of its content
in the form of water vapour.

***** Astrophysics[edit] *****
In astrophysics, mass transfer is the process by which matter gravitationally
bound to a body, usually a star, fills its Roche_lobe and becomes
gravitationally bound to a second body, usually a compact object (white_dwarf,
neutron_star or black_hole), and is eventually accreted onto it. It is a common
phenomenon in binary_systems, and may play an important role in some types of
supernovae and pulsars.
***** Chemical engineering[edit] *****
Mass transfer finds extensive application in chemical_engineering problems. It
is used in reaction engineering, separations engineering, heat transfer
engineering, and many other sub-disciplines of chemical engineering like
electrochemical engineering.[1]
The driving force for mass transfer is usually a difference in chemical
potential, when it can be defined, though other thermodynamic_gradients may
couple to the flow of mass and drive it as well. A chemical species moves from
areas of high chemical potential to areas of low chemical potential. Thus, the
maximum theoretical extent of a given mass transfer is typically determined by
the point at which the chemical potential is uniform. For single phase-systems,
this usually translates to uniform concentration throughout the phase, while
for multiphase systems chemical species will often prefer one phase over the
others and reach a uniform chemical potential only when most of the chemical
species has been absorbed into the preferred phase, as in liquid-liquid
extraction.
While thermodynamic equilibrium determines the theoretical extent of a given
mass transfer operation, the actual rate of mass transfer will depend on
additional factors including the flow patterns within the system and the
diffusivities of the species in each phase. This rate can be quantified through
the calculation and application of mass_transfer_coefficients for an overall
process. These mass transfer coefficients are typically published in terms of
dimensionless_numbers, often including PÃ©clet_numbers, Reynolds_numbers,
Sherwood_numbers and Schmidt_numbers, among others.[2][3][4]
***** Analogies between heat, mass, and momentum transfer[edit] *****
Main article: Transport_phenomena
There are notable similarities in the commonly used approximate differential
equations for momentum, heat, and mass transfer.[2] The molecular transfer
equations of Newton's_law for fluid momentum at low Reynolds_number (Stokes
flow), Fourier's_law for heat, and Fick's_law for mass are very similar, since
they are all linear_approximations to transport of conserved quantities in a
flow field. At higher Reynolds number, the analogy between mass and heat
transfer and momentum transfer becomes less useful due to the nonlinearity of
the Navier-Stokes_equation (or more fundamentally, the general_momentum
conservation_equation), but the analogy between heat and mass transfer remains
good. A great deal of effort has been devoted to developing analogies among
these three transport processes so as to allow prediction of one from any of
the others.
