Monsoon (/mÉnËsuËn/) is traditionally defined as a seasonal reversing wind
accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation,[1] but is now used to
describe seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation
associated with the asymmetric heating of land and sea.[2][3] Usually, the term
monsoon is used to refer to the rainy_phase of a seasonally changing pattern,
although technically there is also a dry phase. The term is sometimes
incorrectly used for locally heavy but short-term rains,[4] although these
rains meet the dictionary definition of monsoon.[5]
The major monsoon systems of the world consist of the West_African and Asia-
Australian monsoons. The inclusion of the North and South_American monsoons
with incomplete wind reversal has been debated.[6]
The term was first used_in_English_in_British_India and neighbouring countries
to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing from the Bay_of_Bengal and Arabian
Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area.[7][8]

***** Etymology *****
Monsoon clouds over Lucknow, Uttar_Pradesh, India
The etymology of the word monsoon is not wholly certain.[9] The English monsoon
came from Portuguese monÃ§Ã£o, ultimately from Arabic mawsim (ÙÙØ³Ù
"season"), "perhaps partly via early modern Dutch monson."[10]
***** History *****
Strengthening of the Asian monsoon has been linked to the uplift of the Tibetan
Plateau after the collision of the Indian_sub-continent and Asia around 50
million years ago.[11] Because of studies of records from the Arabian_Sea and
that of the wind-blown dust in the Loess_Plateau of China, many geologists
believe the monsoon first became strong around 8 million years ago. More
recently, studies of plant fossils in China and new long-duration sediment
records from the South_China_Sea led to a timing of the monsoon beginning
15â20 million years ago and linked to early Tibetan uplift.[12] Testing of
this hypothesis awaits deep ocean sampling by the Integrated_Ocean_Drilling
Program.[13] The monsoon has varied significantly in strength since this time,
largely linked to global climate change, especially the cycle of the
Pleistocene ice ages.[14] A study of marine plankton suggested that the Indian
Monsoon strengthened around 5 million years ago. Then, during ice periods, the
sea level fell and the Indonesian_Seaway closed. When this happened, cold
waters in the Pacific were impeded from flowing into the Indian Ocean. It is
believed that the resulting increase in sea surface temperatures in the Indian
Ocean increased the intensity of monsoons.[15]
Five episodes during the Quaternary at 2.22 Ma (PL-1), 1.83 Ma (PL-2), 0.68 Ma
(PL-3), 0.45 Ma (PL-4) and 0.04 Ma (PL-5) were identified which showed a
weakening of Leeuwin_Current_(LC). The weakening of the LC would have an effect
on the sea_surface_temperature_(SST)_field in the Indian Ocean, as the
Indonesian through flow generally warms the Indian Ocean. Thus these five
intervals could probably be those of considerable lowering of SST in the Indian
Ocean and would have influenced Indian monsoon intensity. During the weak LC,
there is the possibility of reduced intensity of the Indian winter monsoon and
strong summer monsoon, because of change in the Indian Ocean dipole due to
reduction in net heat input to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian through
flow. Thus a better understanding of the possible links between El_NiÃ±o,
Western Pacific Warm Pool, Indonesian_Throughflow, wind pattern off western
Australia, and ice volume expansion and contraction can be obtained by studying
the behaviour of the LC during Quaternary at close stratigraphic intervals.[16]

This visualization shows the Asian monsoon and how it develops using
observational and modeled data. It also shows some of the impacts.
The impact of monsoon on the local weather is different from place to place. In
some places there is just a likelihood of having a little more or less rain. In
other places, quasi semi-deserts are turned into vivid green grasslands where
all sorts of plants and crops can flourish.
The Indian Monsoon turns large parts of India from a kind of semi-desert into
green lands. See photos only taken 3 months apart in the Western Ghats. In
places like this it is crucial for farmers to have the right timing for putting
the seeds on the fields, as it is essential to use all the rain that is
available for growing crops.
***** Process *****
Monsoons are large-scale sea_breezes [17] which occur when the temperature on
land is significantly warmer or cooler than the temperature of the ocean. These
temperature imbalances happen because oceans and land absorb heat in different
ways. Over oceans, the air temperature remains relatively stable for two
reasons: water has a relatively high heat_capacity (3.9 to 4.2 J gâ1 Kâ1),
[18] and because both conduction and convection will equilibrate a hot or cold
surface with deeper water (up to 50 metres). In contrast, dirt, sand, and rocks
have lower heat capacities (0.19 to 0.35 J gâ1 Kâ1),[19] and they can only
transmit heat into the earth by conduction and not by convection. Therefore,
bodies of water stay at a more even temperature, while land temperature are
more variable.
During warmer months sunlight heats the surfaces of both land and oceans, but
land temperatures rise more quickly. As the land's surface becomes warmer, the
air above it expands and an area of low_pressure develops. Meanwhile, the ocean
remains at a lower temperature than the land, and the air above it retains a
higher pressure. This difference in pressure causes sea_breezes to blow from
the ocean to the land, bringing moist air inland. This moist air rises to a
higher altitude over land and then it flows back toward the ocean (thus
completing the cycle). However, when the air rises, and while it is still over
the land, the air cools. This decreases the air's ability_to_hold_water, and
this causes precipitation over the land. This is why summer monsoons cause so
much rain over land.
In the colder months, the cycle is reversed. Then the land cools faster than
the oceans and the air over the land has higher pressure than air over the
ocean. This causes the air over the land to flow to the ocean. When humid air
rises over the ocean, it cools, and this causes precipitation over the oceans.
(The cool air then flows towards the land to complete the cycle.)
Most summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency
to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of
water vapor in the rising air). The intensity and duration, however, are not
uniform from year to year. Winter monsoons, by contrast, have a dominant
easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought.
[20]
Similar rainfall is caused when moist ocean air is lifted upwards by mountains,
[21] surface heating,[22] convergence at the surface,[23] divergence aloft, or
from storm-produced outflows at the surface.[24] However the lifting occurs,
the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, and this produces
condensation.

**** Africa (West African and Southeast African) ****
Southeast African moonsoon clouds, over Mayotte island.
The monsoon of western Sub-Saharan_Africa is the result of the seasonal shifts
of the Intertropical_Convergence_Zone and the great seasonal temperature and
humidity differences between the Sahara and the equatorial Atlantic_Ocean.[30]
It migrates northward from the equatorial Atlantic in February, reaches western
Africa on or near June 22, then moves back to the south by October.[27] The
dry, northeasterly trade_winds, and their more extreme form, the harmattan, are
interrupted by the northern shift in the ITCZ and resultant southerly, rain-
bearing winds during the summer. The semiarid Sahel and Sudan depend upon this
pattern for most of their precipitation.
**** North America ****

The North American monsoon (NAM) occurs from late June or early July into
September, originating over Mexico and spreading into the southwest United
States by mid-July. It affects Mexico along the Sierra_Madre_Occidental as well
as Arizona, New_Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, West_Texas and California. It
pushes as far west as the Peninsular_Ranges and Transverse_Ranges of Southern
California, but rarely reaches the coastal strip (a wall of desert
thunderstorms only a half-hour's drive away is a common summer sight from the
sunny skies along the coast during the monsoon). The North American monsoon is
known to many as the Summer, Southwest, Mexican or Arizona monsoon.[31][32] It
is also sometimes called the Desert monsoon as a large part of the affected
area are the Mojave and Sonoran_deserts. However, it is debatable whether the
North and South_American weather patterns with incomplete wind reversal should
be counted as true monsoons.[6]
**** Asia ****
The Asian monsoons may be classified into a few sub-systems, such as the Indian
Subcontinental Monsoon which affects the Indian subcontinent and surrounding
regions including Nepal, and the East Asian Monsoon which affects southern
China, Taiwan, Korea and parts of Japan.
*** South Asian monsoon ***
Main article: Monsoon_of_South_Asia
** Southwest monsoon **
Onset dates and prevailing wind currents of the southwest summer monsoons in
India
The southwestern summer monsoons occur from July through September. The Thar
Desert and adjoining areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent heat
up considerably during the hot summers. This causes a low pressure area over
the northern and central Indian subcontinent. To fill this void, the moisture-
laden winds from the Indian_Ocean rush into the subcontinent. These winds, rich
in moisture, are drawn towards the Himalayas. The Himalayas act like a high
wall, blocking the winds from passing into Central_Asia, and forcing them to
rise. As the clouds rise, their temperature drops, and precipitation_occurs.
Some areas of the subcontinent receive up to 10,000 mm (390 in) of rain
annually.
The southwest monsoon is generally expected to begin around the beginning of
June and fade away by the end of September. The moisture-laden winds on
reaching the southernmost point of the Indian_Peninsula, due to its topography,
become divided into two parts: the Arabian Sea Branch and the Bay of Bengal
Branch.
The Arabian Sea Branch of the Southwest Monsoon first hits the Western_Ghats of
the coastal state of Kerala,_India, thus making this area the first state in
India to receive rain from the Southwest Monsoon. This branch of the monsoon
moves northwards along the Western_Ghats (Konkan and Goa) with precipitation on
coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The eastern areas of the Western
Ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the
Western Ghats.
The Bay of Bengal Branch of Southwest Monsoon flows over the Bay_of_Bengal
heading towards North-East_India and Bengal, picking up more moisture from the
Bay of Bengal. The winds arrive at the Eastern_Himalayas with large amounts of
rain. Mawsynram, situated on the southern slopes of the Khasi_Hills in
Meghalaya,_India, is one of the wettest places on Earth. After the arrival at
the Eastern Himalayas, the winds turns towards the west, travelling over the
Indo-Gangetic_Plain at a rate of roughly 1â2 weeks per state,[33] pouring
rain all along its way. June 1 is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon
in India, as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state
of Kerala.
The monsoon accounts for nearly 80% of the rainfall in India.[34][35] Indian
agriculture (which accounts for 25% of the GDP and employs 70% of the
population) is heavily dependent on the rains, for growing crops especially
like cotton, rice, oilseeds and coarse grains. A delay of a few days in the
arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy, as evidenced in the
numerous droughts in India in the 1990s.
The monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by city-dwellers as well, for it
provides relief from the climax of summer heat in June.[36] However, the roads
take a battering every year. Often houses and streets are waterlogged and slums
are flooded despite drainage systems. A lack of city infrastructure coupled
with changing climate patterns causes severe economic loss including damage to
property and loss of lives, as evidenced in the 2005_flooding_in_Mumbai that
brought the city to a standstill. Bangladesh and certain regions of India like
Assam and West_Bengal, also frequently experience heavy floods during this
season. Recently, areas in India that used to receive scanty rainfall
throughout the year, like the Thar_Desert, have surprisingly ended up receiving
floods due to the prolonged monsoon season.
The influence of the Southwest Monsoon is felt as far north as in China's
Xinjiang. It is estimated that about 70% of all precipitation in the central
part of the Tian_Shan_Mountains falls during the three summer months, when the
region is under the monsoon influence; about 70% of that is directly of
"cyclonic" (i.e., monsoon-driven) origin (as opposed to "local_convection").
[37]
** Northeast monsoon **
Monsoon clouds in Kolkata
Around September, with the sun fast retreating south, the northern land mass of
the Indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly. With this air pressure
begins to build over northern India, the Indian Ocean and its surrounding
atmosphere still holds its heat. This causes cold wind to sweep down from the
Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic_Plain towards the vast spans of the Indian Ocean
south of the Deccan peninsula. This is known as the Northeast Monsoon or
Retreating Monsoon.
While travelling towards the Indian Ocean, the dry cold wind picks up some
moisture from the Bay_of_Bengal and pours it over peninsular India and parts of
Sri_Lanka. Cities like Chennai, which get less rain from the Southwest Monsoon,
receive rain from this Monsoon. About 50% to 60% of the rain received by the
state of Tamil_Nadu is from the Northeast Monsoon.[38] In Southern Asia, the
northeastern monsoons take place from October to December when the surface
high-pressure_system is strongest.[39] The jet_stream in this region splits
into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet. The subtropical flow
directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern Asia, creating dry air
streams which produce clear skies over India. Meanwhile, a low pressure system
known as a monsoon_trough develops over South-East_Asia and Australasia and
winds are directed toward Australia.
*** East Asian Monsoon ***
Main article: East_Asian_monsoon
The East Asian monsoon affects large parts of Indo-China, Philippines, China,
Taiwan, Korea and Japan. It is characterised by a warm, rainy summer monsoon
and a cold, dry winter monsoon. The rain occurs in a concentrated belt that
stretches east-west except in East China where it is tilted east-northeast over
Korea and Japan. The seasonal rain is known as Meiyu in China, Jangma in Korea,
and Bai-u in Japan, with the latter two resembling frontal rain.
The onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over
South China and Taiwan in early May. From May through August, the summer
monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves
northward, beginning over Indochina and the South_China_Sea (May), to the
Yangtze_River_Basin and Japan (June) and finally to North_China and Korea
(July). When the monsoon ends in August, the rain belt moves back to South
China.
**** Australia ****
Monsoonal squall nears Darwin,_Northern_Territory, Australia
Also known as the Indo-Australian Monsoon. The rainy season occurs from
September to February and it is a major source of energy for the Hadley
circulation during boreal winter. The Maritime Continent Monsoon and the
Australian Monsoon may be considered to be the same system, the Indo-Australian
Monsoon.
It is associated with the development of the Siberian_High and the movement of
the heating maxima from the Northern_Hemisphere to the Southern_Hemisphere.
North-easterly winds flow down Southeast_Asia, are turned north-westerly/
westerly by Borneo topography towards Australia. This forms a cyclonic
circulation vortex over Borneo, which together with descending cold surges of
winter air from higher latitudes, cause significant weather phenomena in the
region. Examples are the formation of a rare low-latitude tropical storm in
2001, Tropical_Storm_Vamei, and the devastating_flood_of_Jakarta in 2007.
The onset of the monsoon over the Maritime Continent tends to follow the
heating maxima down Vietnam and the Malay_Peninsula (September), to Sumatra,
Borneo and the Philippines (October), to Java, Sulawesi (November), Irian_Jaya
and Northern_Australia (December, January). However, the monsoon is not a
simple response to heating but a more complex interaction of topography, wind
and sea, as demonstrated by its abrupt rather than gradual withdrawal from the
region. The Australian monsoon (the "Wet") occurs in the southern summer when
the monsoon trough develops over Northern Australia. Over three-quarters of
annual rainfall in Northern Australia falls during this time.
**** Europe ****
See also: Climate_of_Europe
The European Monsoon (more commonly known as the return of the westerlies) is
the result of a resurgence of westerly winds from the Atlantic, where they
become loaded with wind and rain.[40] These westerly winds are a common
phenomenon during the European winter, but they ease as spring approaches in
late March and through April and May. The winds pick up again in June, which is
why this phenomenon is also referred to as "the return of the westerlies".[41]
The rain usually arrives in two waves, at the beginning of June and again in
mid- to late June. The European monsoon is not a monsoon in the traditional
sense in that it doesn't meet all the requirements to be classified as such.
Instead the return of the westerlies is more regarded as a conveyor belt that
delivers a series of low pressure centres to Western_Europe where they create
unsettled weather. These storms generally feature significantly lower than
average temperatures, fierce rain or hail, thunder and strong winds.[42]
The return of the westerlies affects Europe's Northern_Atlantic coastline, more
precisely Ireland, Great_Britain, the Benelux_countries, Western_Germany,
Northern_France and parts of Scandinavia.
