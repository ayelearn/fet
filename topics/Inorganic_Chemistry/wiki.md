Inorganic chemistry deals with the synthesis and behavior of inorganic and
organometallic compounds. This field covers all chemical_compounds except the
myriad organic_compounds (carbon-based compounds, usually containing C-
H bonds), which are the subjects of organic_chemistry. The distinction between
the two disciplines is far from absolute, as there is much overlap in the
subdiscipline of organometallic_chemistry. It has applications in every aspect
of the chemical industry, including catalysis, materials_science, pigments,
surfactants, coatings, medications, fuels, and agriculture.[1]

***** Key concepts[edit] *****
The structure of the ionic framework in potassium_oxide, K2O
Many inorganic_compounds are ionic_compounds, consisting of cations and anions
joined by ionic_bonding. Examples of salts (which are ionic compounds) are
magnesium_chloride MgCl2, which consists of magnesium cations Mg2+ and chloride
anions Clâ; or sodium_oxide Na2O, which consists of sodium cations Na+ and
oxide anions O2â. In any salt, the proportions of the ions are such that the
electric charges cancel out, so that the bulk compound is electrically neutral.
The ions are described by their oxidation_state and their ease of formation can
be inferred from the ionization_potential (for cations) or from the electron
affinity (anions) of the parent elements.
Important classes of inorganic compounds are the oxides, the carbonates, the
sulfates, and the halides. Many inorganic compounds are characterized by high
melting_points. Inorganic salts typically are poor conductors in the solid
state. Other important features include their high melting point and ease of
crystallization. Where some salts (e.g., NaCl) are very soluble in water,
others (e.g., SiO2) are not.
The simplest inorganic_reaction is double_displacement when in mixing of two
salts the ions are swapped without a change in oxidation state. In redox
reactions one reactant, the oxidant, lowers its oxidation state and another
reactant, the reductant, has its oxidation state increased. The net result is
an exchange of electrons. Electron exchange can occur indirectly as well, e.g.,
in batteries, a key concept in electrochemistry.
When one reactant contains hydrogen atoms, a reaction can take place by
exchanging protons in acid-base_chemistry. In a more general definition, any
chemical species capable of binding to electron pairs is called a Lewis_acid;
conversely any molecule that tends to donate an electron pair is referred to as
a Lewis_base. As a refinement of acid-base interactions, the HSAB_theory takes
into account polarizability and size of ions.
Inorganic compounds are found in nature as minerals. Soil may contain iron
sulfide as pyrite or calcium sulfate as gypsum. Inorganic compounds are also
found multitasking as biomolecules: as electrolytes (sodium_chloride), in
energy storage (ATP) or in construction (the polyphosphate backbone in DNA).
The first important man-made inorganic compound was ammonium_nitrate for soil
fertilization through the Haber_process. Inorganic compounds are synthesized
for use as catalysts such as vanadium(V)_oxide and titanium(III)_chloride, or
as reagents in organic_chemistry such as lithium_aluminium_hydride.
Subdivisions of inorganic chemistry are organometallic_chemistry, cluster
chemistry and bioinorganic_chemistry. These fields are active areas of research
in inorganic chemistry, aimed toward new catalysts, superconductors, and
therapies.
**** Industrial inorganic chemistry[edit] ****
Inorganic chemistry is a highly practical area of science. Traditionally, the
scale of a nation's economy could be evaluated by their productivity of
sulfuric acid. The top 20 inorganic chemicals manufactured in Canada, China,
Europe, India, Japan, and the US (2005 data):[2] Aluminium_sulfate, Ammonia,
Ammonium_nitrate, Ammonium_sulfate, Carbon_black, Chlorine, hydrochloric_acid,
hydrogen, hydrogen_peroxide, nitric_acid, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphoric_acid,
sodium_carbonate, sodium_chlorate, sodium_hydroxide, sodium_silicate, sodium
sulfate, sulfuric_acid, and titanium_dioxide.
The manufacturing of fertilizers is another practical application of industrial
inorganic chemistry.
***** Descriptive inorganic chemistry[edit] *****
Descriptive inorganic chemistry focuses on the classification of compounds
based on their properties. Partly the classification focuses on the position in
the periodic table of the heaviest element (the element with the highest atomic
weight) in the compound, partly by grouping compounds by their structural
similarities. When studying inorganic compounds, one often encounters parts of
the different classes of inorganic chemistry (an organometallic compound is
characterized by its coordination chemistry, and may show interesting solid
state properties).
Different classifications are:
**** Coordination compounds[edit] ****
EDTA chelates an octahedrally coordinated Co3+ ion in [Co(EDTA)]â
Main article: Coordination_chemistry
Classical coordination compounds feature metals bound to "lone_pairs" of
electrons residing on the main group atoms of ligands such as H2O, NH3, Clâ,
and CNâ. In modern coordination compounds almost all organic and inorganic
compounds can be used as ligands. The "metal" usually is a metal from the
groups 3-13, as well as the trans-lanthanides and trans-actinides, but from a
certain perspective, all chemical compounds can be described as coordination
complexes.
The stereochemistry of coordination complexes can be quite rich, as hinted at
by Werner's separation of two enantiomers of [Co((OH)2Co(NH3)4)3]6+, an early
demonstration that chirality is not inherent to organic compounds. A topical
theme within this specialization is supramolecular coordination chemistry.[3]
    * Examples: [Co(EDTA)]â, [Co(NH3)6]3+, TiCl4(THF)2.
**** Main group compounds[edit] ****
Tetrasulfur_tetranitride, S4N4, is a main group compound that continues to
intrigue chemists
These species feature elements from groups I, II, III, IV, V,VI, VII, 0
(excluding hydrogen) of the periodic table. Due to their often similar
reactivity, the elements in group 3 (Sc, Y, and La) and group 12 (Zn, Cd, and
Hg) are also generally included, and the lanthanides and actinides are
sometimes included as well.[4]
Main group compounds have been known since the beginnings of chemistry, e.g.,
elemental sulfur and the distillable white phosphorus. Experiments on oxygen,
O2, by Lavoisier and Priestley not only identified an important diatomic gas,
but opened the way for describing compounds and reactions according to
stoichiometric ratios. The discovery of a practical synthesis of ammonia using
iron catalysts by Carl_Bosch and Fritz_Haber in the early 1900s deeply impacted
mankind, demonstrating the significance of inorganic chemical synthesis.
Typical main group compounds are SiO2, SnCl4, and N2O. Many main group
compounds can also be classed as âorganometallicâ, as they contain organic
groups, e.g., B(CH3)3). Main group compounds also occur in nature, e.g.,
phosphate in DNA, and therefore may be classed as bioinorganic. Conversely,
organic compounds lacking (many) hydrogen ligands can be classed as
âinorganicâ, such as the fullerenes, buckytubes and binary carbon oxides.
    * Examples: tetrasulfur_tetranitride S4N4, diborane B2H6, silicones,
      buckminsterfullerene C60.
**** Transition metal compounds[edit] ****
Compounds containing metals from group 4 to 11 are considered transition metal
compounds. Compounds with a metal from group 3 or 12 are sometimes also
incorporated into this group, but also often classified as main group
compounds.
Transition metal compounds show a rich coordination chemistry, varying from
tetrahedral for titanium (e.g., TiCl4) to square planar for some nickel
complexes to octahedral for coordination complexes of cobalt. A range of
transition metals can be found in biologically important compounds, such as
iron in hemoglobin.
    * Examples: iron_pentacarbonyl, titanium_tetrachloride, cisplatin
**** Organometallic compounds[edit] ****
Organolithium_reagents are most often found in polymeric form, such as n-
butyllithium shown here
Main article: Organometallic_chemistry
Usually, organometallic compounds are considered to contain the M-C-H group.[5]
The metal (M) in these species can either be a main group element or a
transition metal. Operationally, the definition of an organometallic compound
is more relaxed to include also highly lipophilic complexes such as metal
carbonyls and even metal alkoxides.
Organometallic compounds are mainly considered a special category because
organic ligands are often sensitive to hydrolysis or oxidation, necessitating
that organometallic chemistry employs more specialized preparative methods than
was traditional in Werner-type complexes. Synthetic methodology, especially the
ability to manipulate complexes in solvents of low coordinating power, enabled
the exploration of very weakly coordinating ligands such as hydrocarbons, H2,
and N2. Because the ligands are petrochemicals in some sense, the area of
organometallic chemistry has greatly benefited from its relevance to industry.
    * Examples: Cyclopentadienyliron_dicarbonyl_dimer (C5H5)Fe(CO)2CH3,
      Ferrocene Fe(C5H5)2, Molybdenum_hexacarbonyl Mo(CO)6, Diborane B2H6,
      Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) Pd[P(C6H5)3]4
**** Cluster compounds[edit] ****
Decaborane is a powerfully toxic cluster_compound of boron
Iron-sulfur_clusters are central components of iron-sulfur_proteins, essential
for human metabolism
Main article: Cluster_compound
Clusters can be found in all classes of chemical_compounds. According to the
commonly accepted definition, a cluster consists minimally of a triangular set
of atoms that are directly bonded to each other. But metal-metal bonded
dimetallic complexes are highly relevant to the area. Clusters occur in "pure"
inorganic systems, organometallic chemistry, main group chemistry, and
bioinorganic chemistry. The distinction between very large clusters and bulk
solids is increasingly blurred. This interface is the chemical basis of
nanoscience or nanotechnology and specifically arise from the study of quantum
size_effects in cadmium_selenide clusters. Thus, large clusters can be
described as an array of bound atoms intermediate in character between a
molecule and a solid.
    * Examples: Fe3(CO)12, B10H14, [Mo6Cl14]2â, 4Fe-4S
**** Bioinorganic compounds[edit] ****
The octahedral cobalt centre of Vitamin_B12
Main article: Bioinorganic_chemistry
See also: Bioorganometallic_chemistry
By definition, these compounds occur in nature, but the subfield includes
anthropogenic species, such as pollutants (e.g., methylmercury) and drugs
(e.g., Cisplatin).[6] The field, which incorporates many aspects of
biochemistry, includes many kinds of compounds, e.g., the phosphates in DNA,
and also metal complexes containing ligands that range from biological
macromolecules, commonly peptides, to ill-defined species such as humic_acid,
and to water (e.g., coordinated to gadolinium complexes employed for MRI).
Traditionally bioinorganic chemistry focuses on electron- and energy-transfer
in proteins relevant to respiration. Medicinal inorganic chemistry includes the
study of both non-essential and essential_elements with applications to
diagnosis and therapies.
    * Examples: hemoglobin, methylmercury, carboxypeptidase
**** Solid state compounds[edit] ****
Main article: solid-state_chemistry
YBa2Cu3O7, or YBCO, is a high temperature superconductor able to levitate above
a magnet when colder than its critical_temperature of about 90 K (â183 Â°C)
This important area focuses on structure,[7] bonding, and the physical
properties of materials. In practice, solid state inorganic chemistry uses
techniques such as crystallography to gain an understanding of the properties
that result from collective interactions between the subunits of the solid.
Included in solid state chemistry are metals and their alloys or intermetallic
derivatives. Related fields are condensed_matter_physics, mineralogy, and
materials_science.
    * Examples: silicon_chips, zeolites, YBa2Cu3O7
***** Theoretical inorganic chemistry[edit] *****
An alternative perspective on the area of inorganic chemistry begins with the
Bohr_model of the atom and, using the tools and models of theoretical_chemistry
and computational_chemistry, expands into bonding in simple and then more
complex molecules. Precise quantum mechanical descriptions for multielectron
species, the province of inorganic chemistry, is difficult. This challenge has
spawned many semi-quantitative or semi-empirical approaches including molecular
orbital_theory and ligand_field_theory, In parallel with these theoretical
descriptions, approximate methodologies are employed, including density
functional_theory.
Exceptions to theories, qualitative and quantitative, are extremely important
in the development of the field. For example, CuII2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is almost
diamagnetic below room temperature whereas Crystal Field Theory predicts that
the molecule would have two unpaired electrons. The disagreement between
qualitative theory (paramagnetic) and observation (diamagnetic) led to the
development of models for "magnetic coupling." These improved models led to the
development of new magnetic materials and new technologies.
**** Qualitative theories[edit] ****
Crystal_field_theory explains why [FeIII(CN)6]3â has only one unpaired
electron
Inorganic chemistry has greatly benefited from qualitative theories. Such
theories are easier to learn as they require little background in quantum
theory. Within main group compounds, VSEPR theory powerfully predicts, or at
least rationalizes, the structures of main group compounds, such as an
explanation for why NH3 is pyramidal whereas ClF3 is T-shaped. For the
transition metals, crystal_field_theory allows one to understand the magnetism
of many simple complexes, such as why [FeIII(CN)6]3â has only one unpaired
electron, whereas [FeIII(H2O)6]3+ has five. A particularly powerful qualitative
approach to assessing the structure and reactivity begins with classifying
molecules according to electron_counting, focusing on the numbers of valence
electrons, usually at the central atom in a molecule.
**** Molecular symmetry group theory[edit] ****
Nitrogen_dioxide, NO2, exhibits C2v_symmetry
A central construct in inorganic chemistry is the theory of molecular_symmetry.
[8] Mathematical group_theory provides the language to describe the shapes of
molecules according to their point_group_symmetry. Group theory also enables
factoring and simplification of theoretical calculations.
Spectroscopic features are analyzed and described with respect to the symmetry
properties of the, inter alia, vibrational or electronic states. Knowledge of
the symmetry properties of the ground and excited states allows one to predict
the numbers and intensities of absorptions in vibrational and electronic
spectra. A classic application of group theory is the prediction of the number
of C-O vibrations in substituted metal carbonyl complexes. The most common
applications of symmetry to spectroscopy involve vibrational and electronic
spectra.
As an instructional tool, group theory highlights commonalities and differences
in the bonding of otherwise disparate species, such as WF6 and Mo(CO)6 or CO2
and NO2.
***** Thermodynamics and inorganic chemistry[edit] *****
An alternative quantitative approach to inorganic chemistry focuses on energies
of reactions. This approach is highly traditional and empirical, but it is also
useful. Broad concepts that are couched in thermodynamic terms include redox
potential, acidity, phase changes. A classic concept in inorganic
thermodynamics is the Born-Haber_cycle, which is used for assessing the
energies of elementary processes such as electron_affinity, some of which
cannot be observed directly.
***** Mechanistic inorganic chemistry[edit] *****
An important and increasingly popular aspect of inorganic chemistry focuses on
reaction pathways. The mechanisms of reactions are discussed differently for
different classes of compounds.
**** Main group elements and lanthanides[edit] ****
The mechanisms of main group compounds of groups 13-18 are usually discussed in
the context of organic chemistry (organic compounds are main group compounds,
after all). Elements heavier than C, N, O, and F often form compounds with more
electrons than predicted by the octet_rule, as explained in the article on
hypervalent molecules. The mechanisms of their reactions differ from organic
compounds for this reason. Elements lighter than carbon (B, Be, Li) as well as
Al and Mg often form electron-deficient structures that are electronically akin
to carbocations. Such electron-deficient species tend to react via associative
pathways. The chemistry of the lanthanides mirrors many aspects of chemistry
seen for aluminium.
**** Transition metal complexes[edit] ****
Mechanisms for the reactions of transition metals are discussed differently
from main group compounds.[9] The important role of d-orbitals in bonding
strongly influences the pathways and rates of ligand substitution and
dissociation. These themes are covered in articles on coordination_chemistry
and ligand. Both associative and dissociative pathways are observed.
An overarching aspect of mechanistic transition metal chemistry is the kinetic
lability of the complex illustrated by the exchange of free and bound water in
the prototypical complexes [M(H2O)6]n+:
      [M(H2O)6]n+ + 6 H2O* â [M(H2O*)6]n+ + 6 H2O
      where H2O* denotes isotopically enriched water, e.g., H217O
The rates of water exchange varies by 20 orders of magnitude across the
periodic table, with lanthanide complexes at one extreme and Ir(III) species
being the slowest.
*** Redox reactions[edit] ***
Redox reactions are prevalent for the transition elements. Two classes of redox
reaction are considered: atom-transfer reactions, such as oxidative addition/
reductive elimination, and electron-transfer. A fundamental redox reaction is
"self-exchange", which involves the degenerate reaction between an oxidant and
a reductant. For example, permanganate and its one-electron reduced relative
manganate exchange one electron:
      [MnO4]â + [Mn*O4]2â â [MnO4]2â + [Mn*O4]â
*** Reactions at ligands[edit] ***
Coordinated ligands display reactivity distinct from the free ligands. For
example, the acidity of the ammonia ligands in [Co(NH3)6]3+ is elevated
relative to NH3 itself. Alkenes bound to metal cations are reactive toward
nucleophiles whereas alkenes normally are not. The large and industrially
important area of catalysis hinges on the ability of metals to modify the
reactivity of organic ligands. Homogeneous_catalysis occurs in solution and
heterogeneous_catalysis occurs when gaseous or dissolved substrates interact
with surfaces of solids. Traditionally homogeneous_catalysis is considered part
of organometallic chemistry and heterogeneous_catalysis is discussed in the
context of surface_science, a subfield of solid state chemistry. But the basic
inorganic chemical principles are the same. Transition metals, almost uniquely,
react with small molecules such as CO, H2, O2, and C2H4. The industrial
significance of these feedstocks drives the active area of catalysis. Ligands
can also undergo ligand transfer reactions such as transmetalation.
***** Characterization of inorganic compounds[edit] *****
Because of the diverse range of elements and the correspondingly diverse
properties of the resulting derivatives, inorganic chemistry is closely
associated with many methods of analysis. Older methods tended to examine bulk
properties such as the electrical conductivity of solutions, melting_points,
solubility, and acidity. With the advent of quantum_theory and the
corresponding expansion of electronic apparatus, new tools have been introduced
to probe the electronic properties of inorganic molecules and solids. Often
these measurements provide insights relevant to theoretical models. For
example, measurements on the photoelectron_spectrum of methane demonstrated
that describing the bonding by the two-center, two-electron bonds predicted
between the carbon and hydrogen using Valence_Bond_Theory is not appropriate
for describing ionisation processes in a simple way. Such insights led to the
popularization of molecular_orbital_theory as fully delocalised orbitals are a
more appropriate simple description of electron removal and electron
excitation.
Commonly encountered techniques are:
    * X-ray_crystallography: This technique allows for the 3D determination of
      molecular_structures.
    * Dual_polarisation_interferometer: This technique measures the
      conformation and conformational_change of molecules.
    * Various forms of spectroscopy
          o Ultraviolet-visible_spectroscopy: Historically, this has been an
            important tool, since many inorganic compounds are strongly colored
          o NMR_spectroscopy: Besides 1H and 13C many other "good" NMR nuclei
            (e.g., 11B, 19F, 31P, and 195Pt) give important information on
            compound properties and structure. Also the NMR of paramagnetic
            species can result in important structural information. Proton NMR
            is also important because the light hydrogen nucleus is not easily
            detected by X-ray crystallography.
          o Infrared_spectroscopy: Mostly for absorptions from carbonyl_ligands
          o Electron_nuclear_double_resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy
          o MÃ¶ssbauer_spectroscopy
          o Electron-spin_resonance: ESR (or EPR) allows for the measurement of
            the environment of paramagnetic metal centres.
    * Electrochemistry: Cyclic_voltammetry and related techniques probe the
      redox characteristics of compounds.
***** Synthetic inorganic chemistry[edit] *****
Although some inorganic species can be obtained in pure form from nature, most
are synthesized in chemical plants and in the laboratory.
Inorganic synthetic methods can be classified roughly according to the
volatility or solubility of the component reactants.[10] Soluble inorganic
compounds are prepared using methods of organic_synthesis. For metal-containing
compounds that are reactive toward air, Schlenk_line and glove_box techniques
are followed. Volatile compounds and gases are manipulated in âvacuum
manifoldsâ consisting of glass piping interconnected through valves, the
entirety of which can be evacuated to 0.001 mm Hg or less. Compounds are
condensed using liquid_nitrogen (b.p. 78K) or other cryogens. Solids are
typically prepared using tube furnaces, the reactants and products being sealed
in containers, often made of fused silica (amorphous SiO2) but sometimes more
specialized materials such as welded Ta tubes or Pt âboatsâ. Products and
reactants are transported between temperature zones to drive reactions.
