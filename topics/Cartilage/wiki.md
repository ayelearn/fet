Cartilage is a resilient and smooth elastic_tissue, a rubber-like padding that
covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural
component of the rib_cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial_tubes, the
intervertebral_discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and
rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle. The
matrix of cartilage is made up of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, collagen
fibers and, sometimes, elastin.
Because of its rigidity, cartilage often serves the purpose of holding tubes
open in the body. Examples include the rings of the trachea, such as the
cricoid_cartilage and carina.
Cartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a
large amount of collagenous extracellular_matrix, abundant ground_substance
that is rich in proteoglycan and elastin fibers. Cartilage is classified in
three types, elastic_cartilage, hyaline_cartilage and fibrocartilage, which
differ in relative amounts of collagen and proteoglycan.
Cartilage does not contain blood vessels (it is avascular) or nerves (it is
aneural). Nutrition is supplied to the chondrocytes by diffusion. The
compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage
generates fluid flow, which assists diffusion of nutrients to the chondrocytes.
Compared to other connective tissues, cartilage has a very slow turnover of its
extracellular matrix and does not repair.
There are three different types of cartilage: elastic (A), hyaline (B), and
fibrous (C). In elastic cartilage the cells are closer together creating less
intercellular space. Elastic cartilage is found in the external ear flaps and
in parts of the larynx. Hyaline cartilage has fewer cells than elastic
cartilage; there is more intercellular space. Hyaline cartilage is found in the
nose, ears, trachea, parts of the larynx, and smaller respiratory tubes.
Fibrous cartilage has the fewest cells so it has the most intercellular space.
Fibrous cartilage is found in the spine and the menisci.

***** Structure[edit] *****
**** Development[edit] ****
Main article: Chondrogenesis
In embryogenesis, the skeletal system is derived from the mesoderm germ layer.
Chondrification (also known as chondrogenesis) is the process by which
cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue, which differentiates into
chondroblasts and begins secreting the molecules (aggrecan and collagen type
II) that form the extracellular matrix.
Following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis,
cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a
more mature state. The division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly,
and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or
mass of the cartilage itself.[1]
**** Articular cartilage[edit] ****
The articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of
the extracellular_matrix (ECM). The ECM consists mainly of proteoglycan and
collagens. The main proteoglycan in cartilage is aggrecan, which, as its name
suggests, forms large aggregates with hyaluronan. These aggregates are
negatively charged and hold water in the tissue. The collagen, mostly collagen
type II, constrains the proteoglycans. The ECM responds to tensile and
compressive forces that are experienced by the cartilage.[2] Cartilage growth
thus refers to the matrix deposition, but can also refer to both the growth and
remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Due to the great stress on the
patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension, the articular cartilage of
the patella is among the thickest in the human body.
***** Function[edit] *****
**** Mechanical properties[edit] ****
The mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load-bearing joints such as
the knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro, micro, and nano-
scales. These mechanical properties include the response of cartilage in
frictional, compressive, shear and tensile loading. Cartilage is resilient and
displays viscoelastic properties.[3]
**** Frictional properties[edit] ****
Lubricin, a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid, plays a
major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage.[4]
**** Repair[edit] ****
Cartilage has limited repair capabilities: Because chondrocytes are bound in
lacunae, they cannot migrate to damaged areas. Therefore, cartilage_damage is
difficult to heal. Also, because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood
supply, the deposition of new matrix is slow. Damaged hyaline cartilage is
usually replaced by fibrocartilage scar tissue. Over the last years, surgeons
and scientists have elaborated a series of cartilage_repair_procedures that
help to postpone the need for joint replacement.
Bioengineering techniques are being developed to generate new cartilage, using
a cellular "scaffolding" material and cultured_cells to grow artificial
cartilage.[5]
***** Clinical significance[edit] *****
**** Disease[edit] ****
Main article: Chondropathy
Several diseases can affect cartilage. Chondrodystrophies are a group of
diseases, characterized by the disturbance of growth and subsequent
ossification of cartilage. Some common diseases that affect the cartilage are
listed below.
    * Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint, however
      one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage. The
      cartilage covering bones (articular cartilageâa subset of hyaline
      cartilage) is thinned, eventually completely wearing away, resulting in a
      "bone against bone" within the joint, leading to reduced motion, and
      pain. Osteoarthritis affects the joints exposed to high stress and is
      therefore considered the result of "wear and tear" rather than a true
      disease. It is treated by arthroplasty, the replacement of the joint by a
      synthetic joint often made of a stainless steel alloy (cobalt chromoly)
      and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Chondroitin
      sulfate or glucosamine_sulfate supplements, have been claimed to reduce
      the symptoms of osteoarthritis but there is little good evidence to
      support this claim.[6]
    * Traumatic rupture or detachment: The cartilage in the knee is frequently
      damaged but can be partially repaired through knee_cartilage_replacement
      therapy. Often when athletes talk of damaged "cartilage" in their knee,
      they are referring to a damaged meniscus (a fibrocartilage structure) and
      not the articular cartilage.
    * Achondroplasia: Reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal
      plate of long bones during infancy and childhood, resulting in dwarfism.
    * Costochondritis: Inflammation of cartilage in the ribs, causing chest
      pain.
    * Spinal_disc_herniation : Asymmetrical compression of an intervertebral
      disc ruptures the sac-like disc, causing a herniation of its soft
      content. The hernia often compresses the adjacent nerves and causes back
      pain.
    * Relapsing_polychondritis: a destruction, probably autoimmune, of
      cartilage, especially of the nose and ears, causing disfiguration. Death
      occurs by suffocation as the larynx loses its rigidity and collapses.
Tumors made up of cartilage tissue, either benign or malignant, can occur. They
usually appear in bone, rarely in pre-existing cartilage. The benign tumors are
called chondroma, the malignant ones chondrosarcoma. Tumors arising from other
tissues may also produce a cartilage-like matrix, the best known being
pleomorphic_adenoma of the salivary_glands.
The matrix of cartilage acts as a barrier, preventing the entry of lymphocytes
or diffusion of immunoglobulins. This property allows for the transplantation
of cartilage from one individual to another without fear of tissue rejection.
**** Imaging[edit] ****
Cartilage does not absorb x-rays under normal in_vivo conditions, but a dye can
be injected into the synovial_membrane that will cause the x-rays to be
absorbed by the dye. The resulting void on the radiographic film between the
bone and meniscus represents the cartilage. For In_vitro x-ray scans, the outer
soft tissue is most likely removed, so the cartilage and air boundary are
enough to contrast the presence of cartilage due to the refraction of the x-
ray.[7]

***** Other animals[edit] *****
**** Cartilaginous fish[edit] ****
Cartilaginous_fish_(chondrichthyes) like sharks, rays and skates have a
skeleton composed entirely of cartilage.
**** Invertebrate cartilage[edit] ****
Cartilage tissue can also be found among some arthropods such as horseshoe
crabs, some mollusks such as marine snails and cephalopods, and some annelids
like sabellid polychaetes.
  Arthropods
The most studied cartilage in arthropods is the Limulus_polyphemus branchial
cartilage. It is a vesicular cell-rich cartilage due to the large, spherical
and vacuolated chondrocytes with no homologies in other arthropods. Other type
of cartilage found in Limulus polyphemus is the endosternite cartilage, a
fibrous-hyaline cartilage with chondrocytes of typical morphology in a fibrous
component, much more fibrous than vertebrate hyaline cartilage, with
mucopolysaccharides immunoreactive against chondroitin sulfate antibodies.
There are homologous tissues to the endosternite cartilage in other arthropods.
[8] The embryos of Limulus polyphemus express ColA and hyaluronan in the gill
cartilage and the endosternite, which indicates that these tissues are
fibrillar-collagen-based cartilage. The endosternite cartilage forms close to
Hh-expressing ventral nerve cords and expresses ColA and SoxE, a Sox9 analog.
This is also seen in gill cartilage tissue.[9]
  Mollusks
In cephalopods, the models used for the studies of cartilage are Octopus
vulgaris and Sepia_officinalis. The cephalopod cranial cartilage is the
invertebrate cartilage that shows more resemblance to the vertebrate hyaline
cartilage. The growth is though to take place throughout the movement of cells
from the periphery to the center. The chondrocytes present different
morphologies related to their position in the tissue.[8] The embryos of Sepia
officinalis express ColAa, ColAb and hyaluronan in the cranial cartilages and
other regions of chondrogenesis. This implies that the cartilage is fibrillar-
collagen-based. The Sepia officinalis embryo expresses hh, whose presence
causes ColAa and ColAb expression and is also able to maintain proliferating
cells undiferentiated. It has been observed that this species presents the
expression SoxD and SoxE, analogs of the vertebrate Sox5/6 and Sox9, in the
developing cartilage. The cartilage growth pattern is the same than in
vertebrate cartilage.[9]
In gastropods, the interest lies on the odontophore, a cartilaginous structure
that supports the radula. The most studied species regarding to this particular
tissue is Busycon_canaliculatum. The odontophore is a vesicular cell rich
cartilage, consisting on vacuolated cells containing myoglobin, surrounded by a
low amount of extra cellular matrix containing collagen. The odontophore
contains muscle cells along with the chondrocytes in the case of Lymnaea and
other mollusks that graze vegetation.[8]
  Sabellid polychaetes
The Sabellid_polychaetes have cartilage tissue with cellular and matrix
specialization supporting their tentacles. They present two distinct
extracellular matrix regions. These regions are an acellular fibrous region
with a high collagen content, called cartilage-like matrix, and a collagen
lacking highly cellularized core, called osteoid-like matrix. The cartilage-
like matrix surrounds the osteoid-like matrix. The amount of the acellular
fibrous region is variable. The model organisms used in the study of cartilage
in sabellid polychaetes are Potamilla sp and Myxicola_infundibulum.[8]
***** Plants and fungi[edit] *****
    * Vascular_plants, particularly seeds, and the stems of some mushrooms, may
      be referred to as being "cartilaginous", although they contain no
      cartilage.[10]
