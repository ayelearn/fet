Cytoplasmic male sterility is total or partial male sterility in plants as the
result of specific nuclear and mitochondrial interactions.[1] Male sterility is
the failure of plants to produce functional anthers, pollen, or male gametes.

***** Background[edit] *****
Joseph_Gottlieb_KÃ¶lreuter was the first to document male sterility in plants.
He reported anther abortion within species and specific hybrids.
Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) has now been identified in over 150 plant
species.[2] Male sterility is more prevalent than female sterility. This could
be because the male sporophyte and gametophyte are less protected from the
environment than the ovule and embryo_sac. Natural selection on cytoplasmic
genes, which are only maternally inherited and are thus not involved in pollen
production, could also lead to male sterility. Male-sterile plants can set seed
and propagate. Female-sterile plants cannot develop seeds and will not
propagate.
Male sterility can arise spontaneously via mutations in nuclear_genes and/or
cytoplasmic genes. Male sterility is easy to detect because a large number of
pollen grains are produced. Pollen grains can be assayed through staining
techniques (carmine, lactophenol or iodine).

Male sterility can be either cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic–genetic. In this case,
the trigger for CMS is in the extranuclear_genome - (mitochondria or
chloroplast). The extranuclear genome is only maternally inherited.
Manifestation of male sterility in CMS may be controlled either entirely by
cytoplasmic factors or by interactions between cytoplasmic factors and nuclear
factors.
***** Cytoplasmic male sterility[edit] *****
Cytoplasmic male sterility, as the name indicates, is under extranuclear
genetic control (under control of the mitochondrial or plastid genomes). It
shows non-Mendelian_inheritance , with male sterility inherited maternally. In
general, there are two types of cytoplasm: N (normal) and aberrant S (sterile)
cytoplasms. These types exhibit reciprocal differences.
***** Cytoplasmic-genetic male sterility[edit] *****
While CMS is controlled by an extranuclear genome, nuclear genes may have the
capability to restore fertility. When nuclear restoration of fertility genes
("Rf") is available for a CMS system in any crop, it is cytoplasmic–genetic
male sterility; the sterility is manifested by the influence of both nuclear
(with Mendelian inheritance) and cytoplasmic (maternally inherited) genes.
There are also restorers of fertility (Rf) genes that are distinct from genetic
male sterility genes. The Rf genes have no expression of their own unless the
sterile cytoplasm is present. Rf genes are required to restore fertility in S
cytoplasm that causes sterility. Thus plants with N cytoplasm are fertile and S
cytoplasm with genotype Rf- leads to fertiles while S cytoplasm with rfrf
produces only male steriles. Another feature of these systems is that Rf
mutations (i.e., mutations to rf or no fertility restoration) are frequent, so
that N cytoplasm with Rfrf is best for stable fertility.
Cytoplasmic–genetic male sterility systems are widely exploited in crop plants
for hybrid breeding due to the convenience of controlling sterility expression
by manipulating the gene–cytoplasm combinations in any selected genotype.
Incorporation of these systems for male sterility evades the need for
emasculation in cross-pollinated species, thus encouraging cross breeding
producing only hybrid seeds under natural conditions.
***** In hybrid breeding[edit] *****
Hybrid production requires a plant from which no viable male gametes are
introduced. This selective exclusion of viable male gametes can be accomplished
via different paths. One path, emasculation is done to prevent a plant from
producing pollen so that it can serve only as a female parent. Another simple
way to establish a female line for hybrid seed production is to identify or
create a line that is unable to produce viable pollen. Since a male-sterile
line cannot self-pollinate, seed formation is dependent upon pollen from
another male line. Cytoplasmic male sterility is also used in hybrid seed
production. In this case, male sterility is maternally transmitted and all
progeny will be male sterile. These CMS lines must be maintained by repeated
crossing to a sister line (known as the maintainer line) that is genetically
identical except that it possesses normal cytoplasm and is therefore male-
fertile. In cytoplasmic–genetic male sterility restoration of fertility is done
using restorer lines carrying nuclear genes. The male-sterile line is
maintained by crossing with a maintainer line carrying the same nuclear genome
but with normal fertile cytoplasm.
For crops such as onions or carrots where the commodity harvested from the F1
generation is vegetative growth, male sterility is not a problem.

**** In hybrid maize breeding[edit] ****
Cytoplasmic male sterility is an important part of hybrid maize production. The
first commercial cytoplasmic male sterile, discovered in Texas, is known as
CMS-T. The use of CMS-T, starting in the 1950s, eliminated the need for
detasseling. In the early 1970s, plants containing CMS-T genetics were
susceptible to southern_corn_leaf_blight and suffered from widespread loss of
yield. Since then, CMS types C and S were used instead.[3] Unfortunately, these
lines are prone to environmentally induced fertility restoration and must be
carefully monitored in the field. Environmentally induced, in contrast to
genetic, restoration occurs when certain environmental stimuli signal the plant
to bypass sterility restrictions and produce pollen anyway.
Genome sequencing of mitochondrial genomes of crop plants has facilitated the
identification of promising candidates for CMS-related mitochondrial
rearrangements.[4] The systematic sequencing of new plant species in recent
years has also uncovered the existence of several novel nuclear restoration of
fertility (RF) genes and their encoded proteins. A unified nomenclature for the
RF defines protein families across all plant species and facilitates
comparative functional genomics. This nomenclature accommodates functional RF
genes and pseudogenes, and offers the flexibility needed to incorporate
additional RFs as they become available in future.[5]
