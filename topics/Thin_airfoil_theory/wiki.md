This article is about airfoils. For other types of foil, see Foil_
(disambiguation).
Examples of aerofoils in nature and within various vehicles. The dolphin
flipper at bottom left obeys the same principles in a different fluid medium;
it is an example of a hydrofoil.
An airfoil (American_English) or aerofoil (British_English) is the cross-
sectional shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail
(as seen in cross-section).
An airfoil-shaped body moving through a fluid produces an aerodynamic_force.
The component of this force perpendicular to the direction of motion is called
lift. The component parallel to the direction of motion is called drag.
Subsonic_flight airfoils have a characteristic shape with a rounded leading
edge, followed by a sharp trailing_edge, often with a symmetric curvature of
upper and lower surfaces. Foils of similar function designed with water as the
working fluid are called hydrofoils.
The lift on an airfoil is primarily the result of its angle_of_attack and
shape. When oriented at a suitable angle, the airfoil deflects the oncoming air
(for fixed-wing aircraft, a downward force), resulting in a force on the
airfoil in the direction opposite to the deflection. This force is known as
aerodynamic_force and can be resolved into two components: lift and drag. Most
foil shapes require a positive angle of attack to generate lift, but cambered
airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack. This "turning" of the air
in the vicinity of the airfoil creates curved streamlines, resulting in lower
pressure on one side and higher pressure on the other. This pressure difference
is accompanied by a velocity difference, via Bernoulli's_principle, so the
resulting flowfield about the airfoil has a higher average velocity on the
upper surface than on the lower surface. The lift force can be related directly
to the average top/bottom velocity difference without computing the pressure by
using the concept of circulation and the Kutta-Joukowski_theorem.[1][2][3][4]

***** Overview[edit] *****
Streamlines around a NACA 0012 airfoil at moderate angle of attack
Lift and drag curves for a typical airfoil
A fixed-wing_aircraft's wings, horizontal, and vertical stabilizers are built
with airfoil-shaped cross sections, as are helicopter rotor blades. Airfoils
are also found in propellers, fans, compressors and turbines. Sails are also
airfoils, and the underwater surfaces of sailboats, such as the centerboard and
keel, are similar in cross-section and operate on the same principles as
airfoils. Swimming and flying creatures and even many plants and sessile
organisms employ airfoils/hydrofoils: common examples being bird wings, the
bodies of fish, and the shape of sand_dollars. An airfoil-shaped wing can
create downforce on an automobile or other motor vehicle, improving traction.
When the wind is obstructed by an object such as a flat plate, a building, or
the deck of a bridge, the object will experience drag and also an aerodynamic
force perpendicular to the wind. This does not mean the object qualifies as an
airfoil. Airfoils are highly-efficient lifting shapes, able to generate more
lift than similarly sized flat plates of the same area, and able to generate
lift with significantly less drag. Airfoils have potential for use in the
design of aircraft, propellers, rotor blades, wind turbines and other
applications of aeronautical engineering.
A lift and drag curve obtained in wind_tunnel testing is shown on the right.
The curve represents an airfoil with a positive camber so some lift is produced
at zero angle of attack. With increased angle of attack, lift increases in a
roughly linear relation, called the slope of the lift curve. At about 18
degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that. The drop
in lift can be explained by the action of the upper-surface boundary_layer,
which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the
stall angle. The thickened boundary layer's displacement_thickness changes the
airfoil's effective shape, in particular it reduces its effective camber, which
modifies the overall flow field so as to reduce the circulation and the lift.
The thicker boundary layer also causes a large increase in pressure_drag, so
that the overall drag increases sharply near and past the stall point.
Airfoil design is a major facet of aerodynamics. Various airfoils serve
different flight regimes. Asymmetric airfoils can generate lift at zero angle
of attack, while a symmetric airfoil may better suit frequent inverted flight
as in an aerobatic airplane. In the region of the ailerons and near a wingtip a
symmetric airfoil can be used to increase the range of angles of attack to
avoid spinâstall. Thus a large range of angles can be used without boundary
layer_separation. Subsonic airfoils have a round leading edge, which is
naturally insensitive to the angle of attack. The cross section is not strictly
circular, however: the radius_of_curvature is increased before the wing
achieves maximum thickness to minimize the chance of boundary_layer_separation.
This elongates the wing and moves the point of maximum thickness back from the
leading edge.
Supersonic_airfoils are much more angular in shape and can have a very sharp
leading edge, which is very sensitive to angle of attack. A supercritical
airfoil has its maximum thickness close to the leading edge to have a lot of
length to slowly shock the supersonic flow back to subsonic speeds. Generally
such transonic airfoils and also the supersonic airfoils have a low camber to
reduce drag_divergence. Modern aircraft wings may have different airfoil
sections along the wing span, each one optimized for the conditions in each
section of the wing.
Movable high-lift devices, flaps and sometimes slats, are fitted to airfoils on
almost every aircraft. A trailing edge flap acts similarly to an aileron;
however, it, as opposed to an aileron, can be retracted partially into the wing
if not used.
A laminar flow wing has a maximum thickness in the middle camber line.
Analyzing the NavierâStokes_equations in the linear regime shows that a
negative pressure gradient along the flow has the same effect as reducing the
speed. So with the maximum camber in the middle, maintaining a laminar flow
over a larger percentage of the wing at a higher cruising speed is possible.
However, some surface contamination will disrupt the laminar flow, making it
turbulent. For example, with rain on the wing, the flow will be turbulent.
Under certain conditions, insect debris on the wing will cause the loss of
small regions of laminar flow as well.[5] Before NASA's research in the 1970s
and 1980s the aircraft design community understood from application attempts in
the WW II era that laminar flow wing designs were not practical using common
manufacturing tolerances and surface imperfections. That belief changed after
new manufacturing methods were developed with composite materials (e.g.,
graphite fiber) and machined metal methods were introduced. NASA's research in
the 1980s revealed the practicality and usefulness of laminar flow wing designs
and opened the way for laminar flow applications on modern practical aircraft
surfaces, from subsonic general aviation aircraft to transonic large transport
aircraft, to supersonic designs.[6]
Schemes have been devised to define airfoils â an example is the NACA_system.
Various airfoil generation systems are also used. An example of a general
purpose airfoil that finds wide application, and preâdates the NACA system,
is the Clark-Y. Today, airfoils can be designed for specific functions by the
use of computer programs.
***** Airfoil terminology[edit] *****
Airfoil nomenclature
The various terms related to airfoils are defined below:[7]
    * The suction surface (a.k.a. upper surface) is generally associated with
      higher velocity and lower static pressure.
    * The pressure surface (a.k.a. lower surface) has a comparatively higher
      static pressure than the suction surface. The pressure gradient between
      these two surfaces contributes to the lift force generated for a given
      airfoil.
The geometry of the airfoil is described with a variety of terms :
    * The leading_edge is the point at the front of the airfoil that has
      maximum curvature (minimum radius).[8]
    * The trailing_edge is defined similarly as the point of maximum curvature
      at the rear of the airfoil.
    * The chord_line is the straight line connecting leading and trailing
      edges. The chord length, or simply chord,     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c],
      is the length of the chord line. That is the reference dimension of the
      airfoil section.
Different definitions of airfoil thickness
An airfoil designed for winglets (PSU 90-125WL)
The shape of the airfoil is defined using the following geometrical parameters:
    * The mean camber line or mean line is the locus of points midway between
      the upper and lower surfaces. Its shape depends on the thickness
      distribution along the chord;
    * The thickness of an airfoil varies along the chord. It may be measured in
      either of two ways:
          o Thickness measured perpendicular to the camber line.[9][10] This is
            sometimes described as the "American convention";[9]
          o Thickness measured perpendicular to the chord line.[11] This is
            sometimes described as the "British convention".
Some important parameters to describe an airfoil's shape are its camber and its
thickness. For example, an airfoil of the NACA 4-digit series such as the NACA
2415 (to be read as 2 â 4 â 15) describes an airfoil with a camber of 0.02
chord located at 0.40 chord, with 0.15 chord of maximum thickness.
Finally, important concepts used to describe the airfoil's behaviour when
moving through a fluid are:
    * The aerodynamic_center, which is the chord-wise length about which the
      pitching moment is independent of the lift coefficient and the angle of
      attack.
    * The center_of_pressure, which is the chord-wise location about which the
      pitching_moment is zero.
***** Thin airfoil theory[edit] *****
An airfoil section is displayed at the tip of this Denney_Kitfox aircraft,
built in 1991.
Airfoil of Kamov Ka-26 helicopters
Thin airfoil theory is a simple theory of airfoils that relates angle_of_attack
to lift for incompressible, inviscid_flows. It was devised by German-American
mathematician Max_Munk and further refined by British aerodynamicist Hermann
Glauert and others[12] in the 1920s. The theory idealizes the flow around an
airfoil as two-dimensional flow around a thin airfoil. It can be imagined as
addressing an airfoil of zero thickness and infinite wingspan.
Thin airfoil theory was particularly notable in its day because it provided a
sound theoretical basis for the following important properties of airfoils in
two-dimensional flow:[13][14]
   1. on a symmetric airfoil, the center_of_pressure and aerodynamic_center are
      coincident and lie exactly one quarter of the chord behind the leading
      edge.
   2. on a cambered airfoil, the aerodynamic_center lies exactly one quarter of
      the chord behind the leading edge.
   3. the slope of the lift coefficient versus angle of attack line is     2
      &#x03C0;    {\displaystyle 2\pi \!}  [2 \pi\!] units per radian.
As a consequence of (3), the section lift_coefficient of a symmetric airfoil of
infinite wingspan is:
         &#xA0;  c  l   = 2 &#x03C0; &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle \ c_{l}=2\pi
      \alpha }  [ \ c_l = 2\pi \alpha]
      where      c  l      {\displaystyle c_{l}\!}  [c_l\!] is the section lift
      coefficient,
         &#x03B1;    {\displaystyle \alpha \!}  [\alpha\!] is the angle_of
      attack in radians, measured relative to the chord line.
(The above expression is also applicable to a cambered airfoil where
&#x03B1;    {\displaystyle \alpha \!}  [\alpha\!] is the angle of attack
measured relative to the zero-lift_line instead of the chord line.)
Also as a consequence of (3), the section lift coefficient of a cambered
airfoil of infinite wingspan is:
         &#xA0;  c  l   =  c   l  0     + 2 &#x03C0; &#x03B1;   {\displaystyle
      \ c_{l}=c_{l_{0}}+2\pi \alpha }  [ \ c_l = c_{l_0} + 2\pi\alpha]
      where     &#xA0;  c   l  0       {\displaystyle \ c_{l_{0}}}  [ \ c_
      {l_0}] is the section lift coefficient when the angle of attack is zero.
Thin airfoil theory does not account for the stall of the airfoil, which
usually occurs at an angle of attack between 10Â° and 15Â° for typical
airfoils.[15] In the mid-late 2000's, however, a theory predicting the onset of
leading-edge stall was proposed by Wallace J. Morris II in his doctoral thesis.
[16] Morris's subsequent refinements contain the details on the current state
of theoretical knowledge on the leading-edge stall phenomenon.[17][18] Morris's
theory predicts the critical angle of attack for leading-edge stall onset as
the condition at which a global separation zone is predicted in the solution
for the inner flow.[19] Morris's theory demonstrates that a subsonic flow about
a thin airfoil can be described in terms of an outer region, around most of the
airfoil chord, and an inner region, around the nose, that asymptotically match
each other. As the flow in the outer region is dominated by classical thin
airfoil theory, Morris's equations exhibit many components of thin airfoil
theory.

The airfoil is modeled as a thin lifting mean-line (camber line). The mean-
line, y(x), is considered to produce a distribution of vorticity     &#x03B3;
( s )   {\displaystyle \gamma (s)}  [\gamma (s)] along the line, s. By the
Kutta_condition, the vorticity is zero at the trailing edge. Since the airfoil
is thin, x (chord position) can be used instead of s, and all angles can be
approximated as small.
From the BiotâSavart_law, this vorticity produces a flow field     w ( x )
{\displaystyle w(x)}  [w(x)] where
         w ( x ) =   1  ( 2 &#x03C0; )     &#x222B;  0   c      &#x03B3; (  x
      &#x2032;  )   ( x &#x2212;  x &#x2032;  )    d  x &#x2032;
      {\displaystyle w(x)={\frac {1}{(2\pi )}}\int _{0}^{c}{\frac {\gamma (x')}
      {(x-x')}}dx'}  [w(x) = \frac{1} {(2 \pi)} \int_{0}^{c} \frac {\gamma
      (x')}{(x-x')} dx']
   x   {\displaystyle x}  [x] is the location where induced velocity is
produced,      x &#x2032;    {\displaystyle x'}  [x'] is the location of the
vortex element producing the velocity and     c   {\displaystyle c}  [c] is the
chord length of the airfoil.
Since there is no flow normal to the curved surface of the airfoil,     w ( x )
{\displaystyle w(x)}  [w(x)] balances that from the component of main flow
V   {\displaystyle V}  [V], which is locally normal to the plate â the main
flow is locally inclined to the plate by an angle     &#x03B1; &#x2212; d y  /
d x   {\displaystyle \alpha -dy/dx}  [\alpha - dy/dx]. That is:
         V  ( &#x03B1; &#x2212; d y  /  d x ) = w ( x ) =   1  ( 2 &#x03C0; )
      &#x222B;  0   c      &#x03B3; (  x &#x2032;  )   ( x &#x2212;  x &#x2032;
      )    d  x &#x2032;    {\displaystyle V\;(\alpha -dy/dx)=w(x)={\frac {1}{
      (2\pi )}}\int _{0}^{c}{\frac {\gamma (x')}{(x-x')}}dx'}  [V \; (\alpha -
      dy/dx) = w(x) = \frac{1} {(2 \pi)} \int_{0}^{c} \frac {\gamma (x')}{(x-
      x')} dx']
This integral equation can by solved for     &#x03B3; ( x )   {\displaystyle
\gamma (x)}  [\gamma (x)], after replacing x by
         &#xA0; x = c &#x22C5;    1 &#x2212; cos &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; )  2
      {\displaystyle \ x=c\cdot {\frac {1-\cos(\theta )}{2}}}  [{\displaystyle
      \ x=c\cdot {\frac {1-\cos(\theta )}{2}}}] ,
as a Fourier series in      A  n   sin &#x2061; ( n &#x03B8; )   {\displaystyle
A_{n}\sin(n\theta )}  [A_n \sin(n \theta) ] with a modified lead term      A  0
( 1 + cos &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; ) )  /  sin &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; )
{\displaystyle A_{0}(1+\cos(\theta ))/\sin(\theta )}  [A_0 (1 + \cos (\theta))
/ \sin(\theta)]
That is
            &#x03B3; ( &#x03B8; )   ( 2 V )    =  A  0      ( 1 + cos &#x2061;
      ( &#x03B8; ) )   sin &#x2061; ( &#x03B8; )    + &#x2211;  A  n    sin
      &#x2061; ( n &#x03B8; ) )   {\displaystyle {\frac {\gamma (\theta )}{
      (2V)}}=A_{0}{\frac {(1+\cos(\theta ))}{\sin(\theta )}}+\sum A_{n}\;\sin
      (n\theta ))}  [\frac{\gamma(\theta)} {(2V)} = A_0 \frac {(1 + \cos
      (\theta))} {\sin(\theta)} + \sum  A_n \; \sin (n \theta))]
(These terms are known as the Glauert integral).
The coefficients are given by
          A  0   = &#x03B1; &#x2212;   1 &#x03C0;    &#x222B;  0   &#x03C0;
      (    d y   d x    )   d &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle A_{0}=\alpha -{\frac
      {1}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\pi }\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)\;d\theta }  [
      {\displaystyle A_{0}=\alpha -{\frac {1}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\pi }\left(
      {\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)\;d\theta }]
and
          A  n   =   2 &#x03C0;    &#x222B;  0   &#x03C0;    (    d y   d x
      )  cos &#x2061; ( n &#x03B8; )  d &#x03B8;   {\displaystyle A_{n}={\frac
      {2}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\pi }\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)\cos(n\theta
      )\;d\theta }  [{\displaystyle A_{n}={\frac {2}{\pi }}\int _{0}^{\pi
      }\left({\frac {dy}{dx}}\right)\cos(n\theta )\;d\theta }]
By the KuttaâJoukowski_theorem, the total lift force F is proportional to
         &#x03C1; V  &#x222B;  0   c   &#x03B3; ( x )  d x   {\displaystyle
      \rho V\int _{0}^{c}\gamma (x)\;dx}  [ \rho V \int_{0}^{c} \gamma (x) \;
      dx]
and its moment M about the leading edge to
         &#x03C1; V  &#x222B;  0   c   x  &#x03B3; ( x )  d x   {\displaystyle
      \rho V\int _{0}^{c}x\;\gamma (x)\;dx}  [ \rho V \int_{0}^{c} x \; \gamma
      (x) \; dx]
The calculated Lift coefficient depends only on the first two terms of the
Fourier series, as
         &#xA0;  C  L   = 2 &#x03C0; (  A  0   +  A  1    /  2 )
      {\displaystyle \ C_{L}=2\pi (A_{0}+A_{1}/2)}  [ \ C_L = 2 \pi (A_0 + A_1/
      2)]
The moment M about the leading edge depends only on      A  0   ,  A  1
{\displaystyle A_{0},A_{1}}  [A_0,  A_1] and      A  2     {\displaystyle A_
{2}}  [A_{2}], as
         &#xA0;  C  M   = &#x2212; 0.5 &#x03C0; (  A  0   +  A  1   &#x2212;  A
      2    /  2 )   {\displaystyle \ C_{M}=-0.5\pi (A_{0}+A_{1}-A_{2}/2)}  [ \
      C_M = - 0.5 \pi (A_0+A_1-A_2/2)]
The moment about the 1/4 chord point will thus be,
         &#xA0;  C  M   ( 1  /  4 c ) = &#x2212; &#x03C0;  /  4 (  A  1
      &#x2212;  A  2   )   {\displaystyle \ C_{M}(1/4c)=-\pi /4(A_{1}-A_{2})}
      [ \ C_M(1/4c) = - \pi /4 (A_1 - A_2) ].
From this it follows that the center_of_pressure is aft of the 'quarter-chord'
point 0.25 c, by
         &#xA0; &#x0394; x  /  c = &#x03C0;  /  4 ( (  A  1   &#x2212;  A  2
      )  /   C  L   )   {\displaystyle \ \Delta x/c=\pi /4((A_{1}-A_{2})/C_
      {L})}  [ \ \Delta x /c = \pi /4 ((A_1-A_2)/C_L)]
The aerodynamic_center, AC, is at the quarter-chord point. The AC is where the
pitching moment M' does not vary with a change in lift coefficient, i.e.,
            &#x2202; (  C   M &#x2032;    )   &#x2202; (  C  L   )    = 0
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial (C_{M'})}{\partial (C_{L})}}=0}  [ \frac
      { \partial (C_{M'}) }{ \partial (C_L)} = 0 ]
