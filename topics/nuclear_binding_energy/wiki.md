Nuclear binding energy is the minimum energy that would be required to
disassemble the nucleus of an atom into its component parts. These component
parts are neutrons and protons, which are collectively called nucleons. The
binding energy is always a positive number, as we need to spend energy in
moving these nucleons, attracted to each other by the strong_nuclear_force,
away from each other. The mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of the
individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons, according to
Einstein's equation E=mc2. This 'missing mass' is known as the mass_defect, and
represents the energy that was released when the nucleus was formed.
The term "nuclear binding energy" may also refer to the energy balance in
processes in which the nucleus splits into fragments composed of more than one
nucleon. If new binding_energy is available when light nuclei fuse (nuclear
fusion), or when heavy nuclei split (nuclear_fission), either process can
result in release of this binding energy. This energy may be made available as
nuclear energy and can be used to produce electricity, as in nuclear_power, or
in a nuclear_weapon. When a large nucleus splits into pieces, excess energy is
emitted as photon (gamma rays) and as the kinetic energy of a number of
different ejected particles (nuclear_fission products).
These nuclear binding energies and forces are on the order of a million times
greater than the electron_binding_energies of light atoms like hydrogen.[1]
The mass defect of a nucleus represents the amount of mass equivalent to the
binding energy of the nucleus (E=mc2), which is the difference between the mass
of a nucleus and the sum of the individual masses of the nucleons of which it
is composed.[2]

***** Introduction[edit] *****
Nuclear binding energy is explained by the basic principles involved in nuclear
physics.
**** Nuclear energy[edit] ****
An absorption or release of nuclear energy occurs in nuclear_reactions or
radioactive_decay; those that absorb energy are called endothermic reactions
and those that release energy are exothermic reactions. Energy is consumed or
liberated because of differences in the nuclear binding energy between the
incoming and outgoing products of the nuclear transmutation.[3]
The best-known classes of exothermic nuclear transmutations are fission and
fusion. Nuclear energy may be liberated by atomic fission, when heavy atomic
nuclei (like uranium and plutonium) are broken apart into lighter nuclei. The
energy from fission is used to generate electric power in hundreds of locations
worldwide. Nuclear energy is also released during atomic fusion, when light
nuclei like hydrogen are combined to form heavier nuclei such as helium. The
Sun and other stars use nuclear fusion to generate thermal energy which is
later radiated from the surface, a type of stellar nucleosynthesis. In any
exothermic nuclear process, nuclear mass might ultimately be converted to
thermal energy, given off as heat.
In order to quantify the energy released or absorbed in any nuclear
transmutation, one must know the nuclear binding energies of the nuclear
components involved in the transmutation.
**** The nuclear force[edit] ****
Electrons and nuclei are kept together by electrostatic_attraction (negative
attracts positive). Furthermore, electrons are sometimes shared_by_neighboring
atoms or transferred to them (by processes of quantum_physics), and this link
between atoms is referred to as a chemical_bond, and is responsible for the
formation of all chemical_compounds.[4]
The force of electric attraction does not hold nuclei together, because all
protons carry a positive charge and repel each other. Thus, electric_forces do
not hold nuclei together, because they act in the opposite direction. It has
been established that binding neutrons to nuclei clearly requires a non-
electrical attraction.[4]
Therefore, another force, called the nuclear_force (or residual strong force)
holds the nucleons of nuclei together. This force is a residuum of the strong
interaction, which binds quarks into nucleons at an even smaller level of
distance.
The fact that nuclei do not clump together (fuse) under normal conditions
suggests that the nuclear force must be weaker than the electric repulsion at
larger distances, but stronger at close range. Therefore, it has short-range
characteristics. An analogy to the nuclear force is the force between two small
magnets: magnets are very difficult to separate when stuck together, but once
pulled a short distance apart, the force between them drops almost to zero.[4]
Unlike gravity or electrical forces, the nuclear force is effective only at
very short distances. At greater distances, the electrostatic force dominates:
the protons repel each other because they are positively charged, and like
charges repel. For that reason, the protons forming the nuclei of ordinary
hydrogenâfor instance, in a balloon filled with hydrogenâdo not combine to
form helium (a process that also would require some protons to combine with
electrons and become neutrons). They cannot get close enough for the nuclear
force, which attracts them to each other, to become important. Only under
conditions of extreme pressure and temperature (for example, within the core of
a star), can such a process take place.[5]
**** Physics of nuclei[edit] ****
Main article: Atomic_nucleus
There are around 94 naturally occurring elements on earth. The atoms of each
element have a nucleus containing a specific number of protons (always the same
number for a given element), and some number of neutrons, which is often
roughly a similar number. Two atoms of the same element having different
numbers of neutrons are known as isotopes of the element. Different isotopes
may have different properties - for example one might be stable and another
might be unstable, and gradually undergo radioactive_decay to become another
element.
The hydrogen nucleus contains just one proton. Its isotope deuterium,_or_heavy
hydrogen, contains a proton and a neutron. Helium contains two protons and two
neutrons, and carbon, nitrogen and oxygen - six, seven and eight of each
particle, respectively. However, a helium nucleus weighs less than the sum of
the weights of the two heavy hydrogen nuclei which combine to make it. The same
is true for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. For example, the carbon nucleus is
slightly lighter than three helium nuclei, which can combine to make a carbon
nucleus. This difference is known as the mass defect.
*** Mass defect[edit] ***
Not to be confused with mass_excess in nuclear physics or mass_defect in mass
spectrometry.
Mass defect is the difference between the mass of an object and the sum of the
masses of its constituent particles. Discovered by Albert_Einstein in 1905, it
can be explained using his formula E = mc2, which describes the equivalence_of
energy_and_mass. The decrease in mass is equal to the energy given off in the
reaction of an atom's creation divided by c2.[6] By this formula, adding energy
also increases mass (both weight and inertia), whereas removing energy
decreases mass. For example, a helium atom containing four nucleons has a mass
about 0.8% less than the total mass of four hydrogen nuclei (which contain one
nucleon each). The helium nucleus has four nucleons bound together, and the
binding_energy which holds them together is, in effect, the missing 0.8% of
mass.
If a combination of particles contains extra energyâfor instance, in a
molecule of the explosive TNTâweighing it reveals some extra mass, compared
to its end products after an explosion. (The weighing must be done after the
products have been stopped and cooled, however, as the extra mass must escape
from the system as heat before its loss can be noticed, in theory.) On the
other hand, if one must inject energy to separate a system of particles into
its components, then the initial mass is less than that of the components after
they are separated. In the latter case, the energy injected is "stored" as
potential_energy, which shows as the increased mass of the components that
store it. This is an example of the fact that energy of all types is seen in
systems as mass, since mass and energy are equivalent, and each is a "property"
of the other.[7]
The latter scenario is the case with nuclei such as helium: to break them up
into protons and neutrons, one must inject energy. On the other hand, if a
process existed going in the opposite direction, by which hydrogen atoms could
be combined to form helium, then energy would be released. The energy can be
computed using E = Îm c2 for each nucleus, where Îm is the difference between
the mass of the helium nucleus and the mass of four protons (plus two
electrons, absorbed to create the neutrons of helium).
For lighter elements, the energy that can be released by assembling them from
lighter elements decreases, and energy can be released when they fuse. This is
true for nuclei lighter than iron/nickel. For heavier nuclei, more energy is
needed to bind them, and that energy may be released by breaking them up into 2
fragments (known as atomic_fission). Nuclear power is generated at present by
breaking up uranium nuclei in nuclear power reactors, and capturing the
released energy as heat, which is converted to electricity.
As a rule, very light elements can fuse comparatively easily, and very heavy
elements can break up via fission very easily; elements in the middle are more
stable and it is difficult to make them undergo either fusion or fission in an
earthly environment such as a laboratory.
The reason the trend reverses after iron is the growing positive charge of the
nuclei, which tends to force nuclei to break up. It is resisted by the strong
nuclear_interaction, which holds nucleons together. The electric force may be
weaker than the strong nuclear force, but the strong force has a much more
limited range: in an iron nucleus, each proton repels the other 25 protons,
while the nuclear force only binds close neighbors. So for larger nuclei, the
electrostatic forces tend to dominate and the nucleus will tend over time to
break up.
As nuclei grow bigger still, this disruptive effect becomes steadily more
significant. By the time polonium is reached (84 protons), nuclei can no longer
accommodate their large positive charge, but emit their excess protons quite
rapidly in the process of alpha radioactivityâthe emission of helium nuclei,
each containing two protons and two neutrons. (Helium nuclei are an especially
stable combination.) Because of this process, nuclei with more than 94 protons
are not found naturally on Earth (see periodic_table). The isotopes beyond
uranium (atomic number 92) with the longest half-lives are plutonium-244 (80
million years) and curium-247 (16 million years).

The nuclear_fusion process works as follows: five billion years ago, the new
Sun formed when gravity pulled together a vast cloud of hydrogen and dust, from
which the Earth and other planets also arose. The gravitational pull released
energy and heated the early Sun, much in the way Helmholtz proposed.
Thermal energy appears as the motion of atoms and molecules: the higher the
temperature of a collection of particles, the greater is their velocity and the
more violent are their collisions. When the temperature at the center of the
newly formed Sun became great enough for collisions between hydrogen nuclei to
overcome their electric repulsion, and bring them into the short range of the
attractive nuclear_force, nuclei began to stick together. When this began to
happen, protons combined into deuterium and then helium, with some protons
changing in the process to neutrons (plus positrons, positive electrons, which
combine with electrons and annihilate into gamma-ray photons). This released
nuclear energy now keeps up the high temperature of the Sun's core, and the
heat also keeps the gas pressure high, keeping the Sun at its present size, and
stopping gravity from compressing it any more. There is now a stable balance
between gravity and pressure.
Different nuclear reactions may predominate at different stages of the Sun's
existence, including the proton-proton reaction and the carbon-nitrogen
cycleâwhich involves heavier nuclei, but whose final product is still the
combination of protons to form helium.
A branch of physics, the study of controlled_nuclear_fusion, has tried since
the 1950s to derive useful power from nuclear fusion reactions that combine
small nuclei into bigger ones, typically to heat boilers, whose steam could
turn turbines and produce electricity. Unfortunately, no earthly laboratory can
match one feature of the solar powerhouse: the great mass of the Sun, whose
weight keeps the hot plasma compressed and confines the nuclear furnace to the
Sun's core. Instead, physicists use strong magnetic fields to confine the
plasma, and for fuel they use heavy forms of hydrogen, which burn more easily.
Magnetic traps can be rather unstable, and any plasma hot enough and dense
enough to undergo nuclear fusion tends to slip out of them after a short time.
Even with ingenious tricks, the confinement in most cases lasts only a small
fraction of a second.
*** Combining nuclei[edit] ***
Small nuclei that are larger than hydrogen can combine into bigger ones and
release energy, but in combining such nuclei, the amount of energy released is
much smaller compared to hydrogen fusion. The reason is that while the overall
process releases energy from letting the nuclear attraction do its work, energy
must first be injected to force together positively charged protons, which also
repel each other with their electric charge.[5]
For elements that weigh more than iron (a nucleus with 26 protons), the fusion
process no longer releases energy. In even heavier nuclei energy is consumed,
not released, by combining similarly sized nuclei. With such large nuclei,
overcoming the electric repulsion (which affects all protons in the nucleus)
requires more energy than is released by the nuclear attraction (which is
effective mainly between close neighbors). Conversely, energy could actually be
released by breaking apart nuclei heavier than iron.[5]
With the nuclei of elements heavier than lead, the electric repulsion is so
strong that some of them spontaneously eject positive fragments, usually nuclei
of helium that form very stable combinations (alpha_particles). This
spontaneous break-up is one of the forms of radioactivity exhibited by some
nuclei.[5]
Nuclei heavier than lead (except for bismuth, thorium, and uranium)
spontaneously break up too quickly to appear in nature as primordial_elements,
though they can be produced artificially or as intermediates in the decay
chains of heavier elements. Generally, the heavier the nuclei are, the faster
they spontaneously decay.[5]
Iron nuclei are the most stable nuclei (in particular iron-56), and the best
sources of energy are therefore nuclei whose weights are as far removed from
iron as possible. One can combine the lightest ones--nuclei of hydrogen
(protons)--to form nuclei of helium, and that is how the Sun generates its
energy. Or else one can break up the heaviest ones--nuclei of uranium or
plutonium--into smaller fragments, and that is what nuclear_reactors do.[5]
**** Nuclear binding energy[edit] ****
An example that illustrates nuclear binding energy is the nucleus of 12C
(carbon-12), which contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons. The protons are all
positively charged and repel each other, but the nuclear_force overcomes the
repulsion and causes them to stick together. The nuclear force is a close-range
force (it is strongly attractive at a distance of 1.0 fm and becomes extremely
small beyond a distance of 2.5fm), and virtually no effect of this force is
observed outside the nucleus. The nuclear force also pulls neutrons together,
or neutrons and protons.[8]
The energy of the nucleus is negative with regard to the energy of the
particles pulled apart to infinite distance (just like the gravitational energy
of planets of the solar system), because energy must be utilized to split a
nucleus into its individual protons and neutrons. Mass_spectrometers have
measured the masses of nuclei, which are always less than the sum of the masses
of protons and neutrons that form them, and the differenceâby the formula
E = m c2âgives the binding energy of the nucleus.[8]
*** Nuclear fusion[edit] ***
The binding energy of helium is the energy source of the Sun and of most stars.
The sun is composed of 74 percent hydrogen (measured by mass), an element
having a nucleus consisting of a single proton. Energy is released in the sun
when 4 protons combine into a helium nucleus, a process in which two of them
are also converted to neutrons.[8]
The conversion of protons to neutrons is the result of another nuclear force,
known as the weak_(nuclear)_force. The weak force, like the strong force, has a
short range, but is much weaker than the strong force. The weak force tries to
make the number of neutrons and protons into the most energetically stable
configuration. For nuclei containing less than 40 particles, these numbers are
usually about equal. Protons and neutrons are closely related and are
collectively known as nucleons. As the number of particles increases toward a
maximum of about 209, the number of neutrons to maintain stability begins to
outstrip the number of protons, until the ratio of neutrons to protons is about
three to two.[8]
The protons of hydrogen combine to helium only if they have enough velocity to
overcome each other's mutual repulsion sufficiently to get within range of the
strong nuclear attraction. This means that fusion only occurs within a very hot
gas. Hydrogen hot enough for combining to helium requires an enormous pressure
to keep it confined, but suitable conditions exist in the central_regions of
the Sun, where such pressure is provided by the enormous weight of the layers
above the core, pressed inwards by the Sun's strong gravity. The process of
combining protons to form helium is an example of nuclear fusion.[8]
The earth's oceans contain a large amount of hydrogen that could theoretically
be used for fusion, and helium byproduct of fusion does not harm the
environment, so some consider nuclear fusion a good alternative to supply
humanity's energy needs. Experiments to generate electricity from fusion have
so far only partially succeeded. Sufficiently hot hydrogen must be ionized and
confined. One technique is to use very strong magnetic fields, because charged
particles (like those trapped in the Earth's radiation belt) are guided by
magnetic field lines. Fusion experiments also rely on heavy_hydrogen, which
fuses more easily, and gas densities can be moderate. But even with these
techniques far more net energy is consumed by the fusion experiments than is
yielded by the process.[8]
*** The binding energy maximum and ways to approach it by decay[edit] ***
In the main isotopes of light nuclei, such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, the
most stable combination of neutrons and of protons are when the numbers are
equal (this continues to element 20, calcium). However, in heavier nuclei, the
disruptive energy of protons increases, since they are confined to a tiny
volume and repel each other. The energy of the strong force holding the nucleus
together also increases, but at a slower rate, as if inside the nucleus, only
nucleons close to each other are tightly bound, not ones more widely separated.
[8]
The net binding energy of a nucleus is that of the nuclear attraction, minus
the disruptive energy of the electric force. As nuclei get heavier than helium,
their net binding energy per nucleon (deduced from the difference in mass
between the nucleus and the sum of masses of component nucleons) grows more and
more slowly, reaching its peak at iron. As nucleons are added, the total
nuclear binding energy always increasesâbut the total disruptive energy of
electric forces (positive protons repelling other protons) also increases, and
past iron, the second increase outweighs the first. Iron-56 (56Fe) is the most
efficiently bound nucleus[8] meaning that it has the least average mass per
nucleon. However, nickel-62 is the most tightly bound nucleus in terms of
energy of binding per nucleon.[9] (Nickel-62's higher energy of binding does
not translate to a larger mean mass loss than 56Fe, because 62Ni has a slightly
higher ratio of neutrons/protons than does iron-56, and the presence of the
heavier neutrons increases nickel-62's average mass per nucleon).
To reduce the disruptive energy, the weak interaction allows the number of
neutrons to exceed that of protonsâfor instance, the main isotope of iron has
26 protons and 30 neutrons. Isotopes also exist where the number of neutrons
differs from the most stable number for that number of nucleons. If the ratio
of protons to neutrons is too far from stability, nucleons may spontaneously
change from proton to neutron, or neutron to proton.
The two methods for this conversion are mediated by the weak force, and involve
types of beta_decay. In the simplest beta decay, neutrons are converted to
protons by emitting a negative electron and an antineutrino. This is always
possible outside a nucleus because neutrons are more massive than protons by an
equivalent of about 2.5 electrons. In the opposite process, which only happens
within a nucleus, and not to free particles, a proton may become a neutron by
ejecting a positron. This is permitted if enough energy is available between
parent and daughter nuclides to do this (the required energy difference is
equal to 1.022 MeV, which is the mass of 2 electrons). If the mass difference
between parent and daughter is less than this, a proton-rich nucleus may still
convert protons to neutrons by the process of electron_capture, in which a
proton simply electron captures one of the atom's K orbital electrons, emits a
neutrino, and becomes a neutron.[8]
Among the heaviest nuclei, starting with tellurium nuclei (element 52)
containing 104 or more nucleons, electric forces may be so destabilizing that
entire chunks of the nucleus may be ejected, usually as alpha_particles, which
consist of two protons and two neutrons (alpha particles are fast helium
nuclei). (Beryllium-8 also decays, very quickly, into two alpha particles.)
Alpha particles are extremely stable. This type of decay becomes more and more
probable as elements rise in atomic weight past 104.
The curve of binding energy is a graph that plots the binding energy per
nucleon against atomic mass. This curve has its main peak at iron and nickel
and then slowly decreases again, and also a narrow isolated peak at helium,
which as noted is very stable. The heaviest nuclei in nature, uranium 238U, are
unstable, but having a half-life of 4.5 billion years, close to the age of the
Earth, they are still relatively abundant; they (and other nuclei heavier than
helium) have formed in stellar evolution events like supernova explosions [10]
preceding the formation of the solar system. The most common isotope of
thorium, 232Th, also undergoes alpha particle emission, and its half-life (time
over which half a number of atoms decays) is even longer, by several times. In
each of these, radioactive decay produces daughter isotopes that are also
unstable, starting a chain_of_decays that ends in some stable isotope of lead.
[8]
***** Determining nuclear binding energy[edit] *****
Calculation can be employed to determine the nuclear binding energy of nuclei.
The calculation involves determining the mass defect, converting it into
energy, and expressing the result as energy per mole of atoms, or as energy per
nucleon.[2]
**** Conversion of mass defect into energy[edit] ****
Mass defect is defined as the difference between the mass of a nucleus, and the
sum of the masses of the nucleons of which it is composed. The mass defect is
determined by calculating three quantities.[2] These are: the actual mass of
the nucleus, the composition of the nucleus (number of protons and of
neutrons), and the masses of a proton and of a neutron. This is then followed
by converting the mass defect into energy. This quantity is the nuclear binding
energy, however it must be expressed as energy per mole of atoms or as energy
per nucleon.[2]
***** Fission and fusion[edit] *****
Nuclear energy is released by the splitting (fission) or merging (fusion) of
the nuclei of atom(s). The conversion of nuclear mass-energy to a form of
energy, which can remove some mass when the energy is removed, is consistent
with the mass-energy_equivalence formula:
ÎE = Îm c2,
in which,
ÎE = energy release,
Îm = mass_defect,
and c = the speed_of_light in a vacuum (a physical_constant 299,792,458 m/s by
definition).
Nuclear energy was first discovered by French physicist Henri_Becquerel in
1896, when he found that photographic plates stored in the dark near uranium
were blackened like X-ray plates (X-rays had recently been discovered in 1895).
[11]
Nickel-62 has the highest binding energy per nucleon of any isotope. If an atom
of lower average binding energy is changed into two atoms of higher average
binding energy, energy is given off. Also, if two atoms of lower average
binding energy fuse into an atom of higher average binding energy, energy is
given off. The chart shows that fusion of hydrogen, the combination to form
heavier atoms, releases energy, as does fission of uranium, the breaking up of
a larger nucleus into smaller parts. Stability varies between isotopes: the
isotope U-235 is much less stable than the more common U-238.
Nuclear energy is released by three exoenergetic (or exothermic) processes:
    * Radioactive_decay, where a neutron or proton in the radioactive nucleus
      decays spontaneously by emitting either particles, electromagnetic
      radiation (gamma rays), or both. Note that for radioactive decay, it is
      not strictly necessary for the binding energy to increase. What is
      strictly necessary is that the mass decrease. If a neutron turns into a
      proton and the energy of the decay is less than 0.782343 MeV (such as
      rubidium-87 decaying to strontium-87), the average binding energy per
      nucleon will actually decrease.
    * Fusion, two atomic nuclei fuse together to form a heavier nucleus
    * Fission, the breaking of a heavy nucleus into two (or more rarely three)
      lighter nuclei
***** Binding energy for atoms[edit] *****
The binding energy of an atom (including its electrons) is not the same as the
binding energy of the atom's nucleus. The measured mass deficits of isotopes
are always listed as mass deficits of the neutral atoms of that isotope, and
mostly in MeV. As a consequence, the listed mass deficits are not a measure for
the stability or binding energy of isolated nuclei, but for the whole atoms.
This has very practical reasons, because it is very hard to totally ionize
heavy elements, i.e. strip them of all of their electrons.
This practice is useful for other reasons, too: stripping all the electrons
from a heavy unstable nucleus (thus producing a bare nucleus) changes the
lifetime of the nucleus, or the nucleus of a stable neutral atom can likewise
become unstable after stripping, indicating that the nucleus cannot be treated
independently. Examples of this have been shown in bound-state_Î²_decay
experiments performed at the GSI) heavy ion accelerator.[12] [13] This is also
evident from phenomena like electron_capture. Theoretically, in orbital models
of heavy atoms, the electron orbits partially inside the nucleus (it does not
orbit in a strict sense, but has a non-vanishing probability of being located
inside the nucleus).
A nuclear_decay happens to the nucleus, meaning that properties ascribed to the
nucleus change in the event. In the field of physics the concept of "mass
deficit" as a measure for "binding energy" means "mass deficit of the neutral
atom" (not just the nucleus) and is a measure for stability of the whole atom.
***** Nuclear binding energy curve[edit] *****
[Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg]
In the periodic table_of_elements, the series of light elements from hydrogen
up to sodium is observed to exhibit generally increasing binding energy per
nucleon as the atomic_mass increases. This increase is generated by increasing
forces per nucleon in the nucleus, as each additional nucleon is attracted by
other nearby nucleons, and thus more tightly bound to the whole.
The region of increasing binding energy is followed by a region of relative
stability (saturation) in the sequence from magnesium through xenon. In this
region, the nucleus has become large enough that nuclear forces no longer
completely extend efficiently across its width. Attractive nuclear forces in
this region, as atomic mass increases, are nearly balanced by repellent
electromagnetic forces between protons, as the atomic_number increases.
Finally, in elements heavier than xenon, there is a decrease in binding energy
per nucleon as atomic number increases. In this region of nuclear size,
electromagnetic repulsive forces are beginning to overcome the strong nuclear
force attraction.
At the peak of binding energy, nickel-62 is the most tightly bound nucleus (per
nucleon), followed by iron-58 and iron-56.[14] This is the approximate basic
reason why iron and nickel are very common metals in planetary cores, since
they are produced profusely as end products in supernovae and in the final
stages of silicon_burning in stars. However, it is not binding energy per
defined nucleon (as defined above), which controls which exact nuclei are made,
because within stars, neutrons are free to convert to protons to release even
more energy, per generic nucleon, if the result is a stable nucleus with a
larger fraction of protons. In fact, it has been argued that
photodisintegration of 62Ni to form 56Fe may be energetically possible in an
extremely hot star core, due to this beta decay conversion of neutrons to
protons.[15] The conclusion is that at the pressure and temperature conditions
in the cores of large stars, energy is released by converting all matter into
56Fe nuclei (ionized atoms). (However, at high temperatures not all matter will
be in the lowest energy state.) This energetic maximum should also hold for
ambient conditions, say T = 298 K and p = 1 atm, for neutral condensed matter
consisting of 56Fe atomsâhowever, in these conditions nuclei of atoms are
inhibited from fusing into the most stable and low energy state of matter.
It is generally believed that iron-56 is more common than nickel isotopes in
the universe for mechanistic reasons, because its unstable progenitor nickel-56
is copiously made by staged build-up of 14 helium nuclei inside supernovas,
where it has no time to decay to iron before being released into the
interstellar medium in a matter of a few minutes, as the supernova explodes.
However, nickel-56 then decays to cobalt-56 within a few weeks, then this
radioisotope finally decays to iron-56 with a half life of about 77.3 days. The
radioactive decay-powered light curve of such a process has been observed to
happen in type_II_supernovae, such as SN_1987A. In a star, there are no good
ways to create nickel-62 by alpha-addition processes, or else there would
presumably be more of this highly stable nuclide in the universe.

The fact that the maximum binding energy is found in medium-sized nuclei is a
consequence of the trade-off in the effects of two opposing forces that have
different range characteristics. The attractive nuclear force (strong_nuclear
force), which binds protons and neutrons equally to each other, has a limited
range due to a rapid exponential decrease in this force with distance. However,
the repelling electromagnetic force, which acts between protons to force nuclei
apart, falls off with distance much more slowly (as the inverse square of
distance). For nuclei larger than about four nucleons in diameter, the
additional repelling force of additional protons more than offsets any binding
energy that results between further added nucleons as a result of additional
strong force interactions. Such nuclei become increasingly less tightly bound
as their size increases, though most of them are still stable. Finally, nuclei
containing more than 209 nucleons (larger than about 6 nucleons in diameter)
are all too large to be stable, and are subject to spontaneous decay to smaller
nuclei.
Nuclear_fusion produces energy by combining the very lightest elements into
more tightly bound elements (such as hydrogen into helium), and nuclear_fission
produces energy by splitting the heaviest elements (such as uranium and
plutonium) into more tightly bound elements (such as barium and krypton). Both
processes produce energy, because middle-sized nuclei are the most tightly
bound of all.
As seen above in the example of deuterium, nuclear binding energies are large
enough that they may be easily measured as fractional mass deficits, according
to the equivalence of mass and energy. The atomic binding energy is simply the
amount of energy (and mass) released, when a collection of free nucleons are
joined together to form a nucleus.
Nuclear binding energy can be computed from the difference in mass of a
nucleus, and the sum of the masses of the number of free neutrons and protons
that make up the nucleus. Once this mass difference, called the mass defect or
mass deficiency, is known, Einstein's mass-energy_equivalence formula E = mcÂ²
can be used to compute the binding energy of any nucleus. Early nuclear
physicists used to refer to computing this value as a "packing fraction"
calculation.
For example, the atomic_mass_unit (1 u) is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a 12C
atomâbut the atomic mass of a 1H atom (which is a proton plus electron) is
1.007825 u, so each nucleon in 12C has lost, on average, about 0.8% of its mass
in the form of binding energy.
**** Semiempirical formula for nuclear binding energy[edit] ****
Main article: Semi-empirical_mass_formula
For a nucleus with A nucleons, including Z protons and N neutrons, a semi-
empirical_formula for the binding energy (BE) per nucleon is:
           BE  A &#x22C5;  MeV     = a &#x2212;   b  A  1  /  3     &#x2212;
      c  Z  2     A  4  /  3     &#x2212;    d   (  N &#x2212; Z  )   2     A
      2     &#x00B1;   e  A  7  /  4       {\displaystyle {\frac {\text{BE}}
      {A\cdot {\text{MeV}}}}=a-{\frac {b}{A^{1/3}}}-{\frac {cZ^{2}}{A^{4/3}}}-
      {\frac {d\left(N-Z\right)^{2}}{A^{2}}}\pm {\frac {e}{A^{7/4}}}}  [{\frac
      {\text{BE}}{A\cdot {\text{MeV}}}}=a-{\frac {b}{A^{1/3}}}-{\frac {cZ^{2}}
      {A^{4/3}}}-{\frac {d\left(N-Z\right)^{2}}{A^{2}}}\pm {\frac {e}{A^{7/
      4}}}]
where the coefficients are given by:     a = 14.0   {\displaystyle a=14.0}
[a=14.0];     b = 13.0   {\displaystyle b=13.0}  [b=13.0];     c = 0.585
{\displaystyle c=0.585}  [c=0.585];     d = 19.3   {\displaystyle d=19.3}
[d=19.3];     e = 33   {\displaystyle e=33}  [e=33].
The first term     a   {\displaystyle a}  [a] is called the saturation
contribution and ensures that the binding energy per nucleon is the same for
all nuclei to a first approximation. The term     &#x2212; b  /   A  1  /  3
{\displaystyle -b/A^{1/3}}  [-b/A^{1/3}] is a surface tension effect and is
proportional to the number of nucleons that are situated on the nuclear
surface; it is largest for light nuclei. The term     &#x2212; c  Z  2    /   A
4  /  3     {\displaystyle -cZ^{2}/A^{4/3}}  [-cZ^{2}/A^{4/3}] is the Coulomb
electrostatic repulsion; this becomes more important as     Z   {\displaystyle
Z}  [Z] increases. The symmetry correction term     &#x2212; d ( N &#x2212; Z
)  2    /   A  2     {\displaystyle -d(N-Z)^{2}/A^{2}}  [-d(N-Z)^{2}/A^{2}]
takes into account the fact that in the absence of other effects the most
stable arrangement has equal numbers of protons and neutrons; this is because
the n-p interaction in a nucleus is stronger than either the n-n or p-
p interaction. The pairing term     &#x00B1; e  /   A  7  /  4
{\displaystyle \pm e/A^{7/4}}  [\pm e/A^{7/4}] is purely empirical; it is + for
even-even nuclei and - for odd-odd_nuclei.
A graphical representation of the semi-empirical binding energy formula. The
binding energy per nucleon in MeV (highest numbers in yellow, in excess of 8.5
MeV per nucleon) is plotted for various nuclides as a function of Z, the atomic
number (y-axis), vs. N, the number of neutrons (x-axis). The highest numbers
are seen for Z = 26 (iron).
***** Example values deduced from experimentally measured atom nuclide masses
[edit] *****
The following table lists some binding energies and mass defect values.[16]
Notice also that we use 1 u = (931.494028 Â± 0.000023) MeV. To calculate the
binding energy we use the formula Z (mp + me) + N mn − mnuclide where Z denotes
the number of protons in the nuclides and N their number of neutrons. We take
mp = (938.2720813Â±0.0000058) MeV, me = (0.5109989461Â±0.000000003) MeV and
mn = (939.5654133 Â± 0000058) MeV. The letter A denotes the sum of Z and N
(number of nucleons in the nuclide). If we assume the reference nucleon has the
mass of a neutron (so that all "total" binding energies calculated are maximal)
we could define the total binding energy as the difference from the mass of the
nucleus, and the mass of a collection of A free neutrons. In other words, it
would be (Z + N) mn − mnuclide. The "total binding energy per nucleon" would be
this value divided by A.

56Fe has the lowest nucleon-specific mass of the four nuclides listed in this
table, but this does not imply it is the strongest bound atom per hadron,
unless the choice of beginning hadrons is completely free. Iron releases the
largest energy if any 56 nucleons are allowed to build a nuclideâchanging one
to another if necessary, The highest binding energy per hadron, with the
hadrons starting as the same number of protons Z and total nucleons A as in the
bound nucleus, is 62Ni. Thus, the true absolute value of the total binding
energy of a nucleus depends on what we are allowed to construct the nucleus out
of. If all nuclei of mass number A were to be allowed to be constructed of A
neutrons, then 56Fe would release the most energy per nucleon, since it has a
larger fraction of protons than 62Ni. However, if nuclei are required to be
constructed of only the same number of protons and neutrons that they contain,
then nickel-62 is the most tightly bound nucleus, per nucleon.

In the table above it can be seen that the decay of a neutron, as well as the
transformation of tritium into helium-3, releases energy; hence, it manifests a
stronger bound new state when measured against the mass of an equal number of
neutrons (and also a lighter state per number of total hadrons). Such reactions
are not driven by changes in binding energies as calculated from previously
fixed N and Z numbers of neutrons and protons, but rather in decreases in the
total mass of the nuclide/per nucleon, with the reaction. (Note that the
Binding Energy given above for hydrogen-1 is the atomic binding energy, not the
nuclear binding energy which would be zero.)
