Role of Production Planning in the Production Cycle.
Production planning is the planning of production and manufacturing modules in
a company or industry. It utilizes the resource_allocation of activities of
employees, materials and production_capacity, in order to serve different
customers.[1]
Different types of production methods, such as single item manufacturing, batch
production, mass_production, continuous_production etc. have their own type of
production planning. Production planning can be combined with production
control into production planning and control, or it can be combined with
enterprise_resource_planning.
Production planning is used in companies in several different industries,
including agriculture industry, amusement industry, etc.

***** Overview[edit] *****
Production planning is the future of production. It can help in efficient
manufacturing or setting up of a production site by facilitating required
needs.[2] A production plan is made periodically for a specific time period,
called the planning horizon. It can comprise the following activities:
    * Determination of the required product mix and factory load to satisfy
      customers needs.[3]
    * Matching the required level of production to the existing resources.[4]
    * Scheduling and choosing the actual work to be started in the
      manufacturing facility"[1]
    * Setting up and delivering production orders to production facilities.[5]
In order to develop production plans, the production planner or production
planning department needs to work closely together with the marketing
department and sales department. They can provide sales forecasts, or a listing
of customer orders."[6] The "work is usually selected from a variety of product
types which may require different resources and serve different customers.
Therefore, the selection must optimize customer-independent performance
measures such as cycle time and customer-dependent performance measures such as
on-time delivery."[1]
A critical factor in production planning is "the accurate estimation of the
productive capacity of available resources, yet this is one of the most
difficult tasks to perform well".[7] Production planning should always take
"into account material availability, resource availability and knowledge of
future demand".[5]
***** History[edit] *****
Planning department bulletin board, 1911.
Modern production planning methods and tools have been developed since late
19th century. Under Scientific_Management, the work for each man or each
machine is mapped out in advance (see image). The origin of production planning
back goes another century. Kaplan (1986) summarized that "the demand for
information for internal planning and control apparently arose in the first
half of the 20th century when firms, such as textile mills and railroads, had
to devise internal administrative procedures to coordinate the multiple
processes involved in the performance of the basic activity (the conversion of
raw materials into finished goods by textile mills, the transportation of
passengers and freight by the railroads."[8]
Herrmann (1996) further describes the circumstances in which new methods for
internal planning and control evolved: "The first factories were quite simple
and relatively small. They produced a small number of products in large
batches. Productivity gains came from using interchangeable_parts to eliminate
time-consuming fitting operations. Through the late 1800s, manufacturing firms
were concerned with maximizing the productivity of the expensive equipment in
the factory. Keeping utilization high was an important objective. Foremen ruled
their shops, coordinating all of the activities needed for the limited number
of products for which they were responsible. They hired operators, purchased
materials, managed production, and delivered the product. They were experts
with superior technical skills, and they (not a separate staff of clerks)
planned production. Even as factories grew, they were just bigger, not more
complex.[9]
About production planning Herrmann (1996) recounts that "production scheduling
started simply also. Schedules, when used at all, listed only when work on an
order should begin or when the order is due. They didn't provide any
information about how long the total order should take or about the time
required for individual operations ..."[9]
In 1923 Industrial Management cited a Mr. Owens who had observed: "Production
planning is rapidly becoming one of the most vital necessities of management.
It is true that every establishment, no matter how large or how small has
production planning in some form; but a large percentage of these do not have
planning that makes for an even flow of material, and a minimum amount of money
tied up in inventories."[10]

Different types of production planning can be applied:
    * Advanced_planning_and_scheduling
    * Capacity_planning
    * Master_production_schedule
    * Material_requirements_planning
    * MRP_II
    * Scheduling
    * Workflow

    * Employee_scheduling
    * Enterprise_resource_planning
    * Inventory_control
    * Product_planning
    * Project_planning
    * Process_planning, redirects to Computer-aided_process_planning
    * Sales_and_operations_planning
    * Strategy
**** Production control[edit] ****
Production_control is the activity of controlling the workflow in the
production. It is partly complementary to production planning.
