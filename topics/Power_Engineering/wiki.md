Power engineering, also called power systems engineering, is a subfield of
electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission,
distribution and utilization of electric_power, and the electrical apparatus
connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the
problems of three-phase_AC_power â the standard for large-scale power
transmission and distribution across the modern world â a significant
fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between AC_and_DC_power
and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft
or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its
theoretical base from electrical_engineering.

***** History[edit] *****
A sketch of the Pearl Street Station, the first steam-powered electric power
station in New York City
Main article: Electrical_engineering_Â§ History
***** Pioneering years[edit] *****
Electricity became a subject of scientific interest in the late 17th century.
Over the next two centuries a number of important discoveries were made
including the incandescent_light_bulb and the voltaic_pile.[1][2] Probably the
greatest discovery with respect to power engineering came from Michael_Faraday
who in 1831 discovered that a change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive
force in a loop of wire—a principle known as electromagnetic_induction that
helps explain how generators and transformers work.[3]
In 1881 two electricians built the world's first power station at Godalming in
England. The station employed two waterwheels to produce an alternating current
that was used to supply seven Siemens arc_lamps at 250 volts and thirty-four
incandescent_lamps at 40 volts.[4] However supply was intermittent and in 1882
Thomas_Edison and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the
first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City.
The Pearl_Street_Station consisted of several generators and initially powered
around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers.[5][6] The power station used direct
current and operated at a single voltage. Since the direct current power could
not be easily transformed to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power
loss during transmission, the possible distance between the generators and load
was limited to around half-a-mile (800 m).[7]
That same year in London Lucien_Gaulard and John_Dixon_Gibbs demonstrated the
first transformer suitable for use in a real power system. The practical value
of Gaulard and Gibbs' transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at Turin where the
transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a
single alternating_current generator.[8] Despite the success of the system, the
pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting
the primaries of the transformers in series so that switching one lamp on or
off would affect other lamps further down the line. Following the demonstration
George_Westinghouse, an American entrepreneur, imported a number of the
transformers along with a Siemens generator and set his engineers to
experimenting with them in the hopes of improving them for use in a commercial
power system.
One of Westinghouse's engineers, William_Stanley, recognised the problem with
connecting transformers in series as opposed to parallel and also realised that
making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the
voltage_regulation of the secondary winding. Using this knowledge he built the
world's first practical transformer based alternating current power system at
Great_Barrington,_Massachusetts in 1886.[9][10] In 1885 the Italian physicist
and electrical engineer Galileo_Ferraris demonstrated an induction_motor and in
1887 and 1888 the Serbian-American engineer Nikola_Tesla filed a range of
patents related to power systems including one for a practical two-phase
induction motor[11][12] which Westinghouse licensed for his AC system.
By 1890 the power industry had flourished and power companies had built
thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United
States and Europe â these networks were effectively dedicated to providing
electric lighting. During this time a fierce rivalry in the US known as the
"War_of_Currents" emerged between Edison and Westinghouse over which form of
transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior. In 1891,
Westinghouse installed the first major power system that was designed to drive
an electric motor and not just provide electric lighting. The installation
powered a 100 horsepower (75 kW) synchronous motor at Telluride,_Colorado with
the motor being started by a Tesla induction motor.[13] On the other side of
the Atlantic, Oskar_von_Miller built a 20 kV 176 km three-phase transmission
line from Lauffen_am_Neckar to Frankfurt_am_Main for the Electrical Engineering
Exhibition in Frankfurt.[14] In 1895, after a protracted decision-making
process, the Adams_No._1_generating_station at Niagara_Falls began transmitting
three-phase alternating current power to Buffalo at 11 kV. Following completion
of the Niagara Falls project, new power systems increasingly chose alternating
current as opposed to direct_current for electrical transmission.[15]

***** Twentieth century[edit] *****
**** Power engineering and Bolshevism[edit] ****
1929 poster by Gustav_Klutsis
The generation of electricity was regarded as particularly important following
the Bolshevik_seizure_of_power. Lenin stated "Communism is Soviet power plus
the electrification of the whole country."[16] He was subsequently featured on
many Soviet posters, stamps etc. presenting this view. The GOELRO_plan was
initiated in 1920 as the first Bolshevik experiment in industrial planning and
in which Lenin became personally involved. Gleb_Krzhizhanovsky was another key
figure involved, having been involved in the construction of a power station in
Moscow in 1910. He had also known Lenin since 1897 when they were both in the
St. Petersburg chapter of the Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the
Working Class.
**** Power engineering in the USA[edit] ****
In 1936 the first commercial high-voltage_direct_current (HVDC) line using
mercury-arc_valves was built between Schenectady and Mechanicville,_New_York.
HVDC had previously been achieved by installing direct current generators in
series (a system known as the Thury_system) although this suffered from serious
reliability issues.[17] In 1957 Siemens demonstrated the first solid-state
rectifier (solid-state rectifiers are now the standard for HVDC systems)
however it was not until the early 1970s that this technology was used in
commercial power systems.[18] In 1959 Westinghouse demonstrated the first
circuit_breaker that used SF6 as the interrupting medium.[19] SF6 is a far
superior dielectric to air and, in recent times, its use has been extended to
produce far more compact switching equipment (known as switchgear) and
transformers.[20][21] Many important developments also came from extending
innovations in the ICT field to the power engineering field. For example, the
development of computers meant load_flow_studies could be run more efficiently
allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information
technology and telecommunication also allowed for much better remote control of
the power system's switchgear and generators.
***** Power[edit] *****
Transmission lines transmit power across the grid.
Power Engineering deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and
utilization of electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices.
These include transformers, electric_generators, electric_motors and power
electronics.
Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid. These
systems are called off-grid power systems and may be used in preference to on-
grid systems for a variety of reasons. For example, in remote locations it may
be cheaper for a mine to generate its own power rather than pay for connection
to the grid and in most mobile applications connection to the grid is simply
not practical.
***** Fields[edit] *****
Electricity_generation covers the selection, design and construction of
facilities that convert energy from primary forms to electric power.
Electric_power_transmission requires the engineering of high voltage
transmission lines and substation facilities to interface to generation and
distribution systems. High_voltage_direct_current systems are one of the
elements of an electric power grid.
Electric_power_distribution engineering covers those elements of a power system
from a substation to the end customer.
Power_system_protection is the study of the ways an electrical power system can
fail, and the methods to detect and mitigate for such failures.
In most projects, a power engineer must coordinate with many other disciplines
such as civil and mechanical engineers, environmental experts, and legal and
financial personnel. Major power system projects such as a large generating
station may require scores of design professionals in addition to the power
system engineers. At most levels of professional power system engineering
practice, the engineer will require as much in the way of administrative and
organizational skills as electrical engineering knowledge.
***** Professional societies and international standards organizations[edit]
*****
In both the UK and the USA, professional societies had long existed for civil
and mechanical engineers. The IEE was founded in the UK in 1871, and the AIEE
in the United States in 1884. These societies contributed to the exchange of
electrical knowledge and the development of electrical engineering education.
On an international level, the International_Electrotechnical_Commmission,
which was founded in 1906, prepares standards for power engineering, with
20,000 electrotechnical experts from 172 countries developing global
specifications based on consensus.
