A step climb in aviation is a series of altitude gains that improve fuel
economy by moving into thinner air as an aircraft becomes lighter and becomes
capable of flying in the thinner air at higher altitude.
***** Description[edit] *****
Since the early days of jet aircraft and commercial travel, the technique of
gradually climbing in cruise altitude as fuel burns off and the aircraft
becomes lighter has been widely used by pilots. The altitude that provides the
most fuel-efficient cruise (at the desired speed) at the start of a long
flight, when the aircraft is fully loaded with fuel, is not the same as the
altitude that provides the best efficiency at the end of the flight, when most
of the fuel aboard has been burned. This latter altitude is usually
significantly higher than the former. By climbing gradually throughout the
cruise phase of a flight, pilots can make the most economical use of their
fuel.
Originally, a simple cruise climb was used by pilots. This amounted to a
simple, continuous, very gradual climb from an initial cruise altitude to a
final cruise altitude, and made the most efficient use of fuel. However, with
increasing air traffic and the assignment of distinct flight_levels to specific
flights, airways, and directions of flight, it is no longer safe to climb
continuously in this way, and so most flights compromise by climbing in
distinct steps—a step climb—with ATC approval, in order to ensure that the
aircraft is always at an appropriate altitude for traffic control. While not
quite as efficient as a continuous cruise climb, step climbs are still more
efficient than maintaining a single altitude throughout a flight. The step
climb intervals may be 1000, 2000, or 4000 feet, depending on the flight_level
rules which apply on the particular airway being flown.
Where traffic is not an issue, cruise climbs may still be used. Concorde, for
example, used a continuous cruise climb throughout its flights, since there was
normally never any other traffic at the same altitude (nearly 60,000 feet) in
the same direction.
In most modern commercial airliners, computers such as flight_management
systems (FMS) calculate and/or execute the proper steps in a step climb, in
order to maximize the efficiency realized by the technique.
Step and cruise climbs are not normally applicable to lower-flying aircraft
propelled by conventional piston_engines with propellers or turboprops, since
their performance characteristics may be very different from those of turbofan
or jet_engined aircraft. In fact, the most efficient altitude for a small
general aviation aircraft may be only a few thousand feet above the ground, and
increasing altitude may diminish efficiency rather than improve it (propellers
tend to lose efficiency in thinner air, and many small general_aviation
aircraft lack supercharging, effectively decreasing the engine's compression
pressure, and therefore efficiency, as the aircraft climbs into more rarified
atmosphere).
**** Informal step climbs[edit] ****
Some pilots use "rules of thumb" for determining when to perform a step climb.
These "rules" do not consider the effects of different winds at different
levels; computerised flight_planning systems may be better at height
optimisation, and may even include 'step descents' in certain weather
conditions. Two of the information rules used by some pilots are:
    * Keep climbing whenever the aircraft is light enough to climb to the next
      highest available flight_level, until it is time for descent.
    * If it is possible to stay at the next higher cruise flight_level for 20
      minutes or more before "top of descent" (TOD) then it is cost-effective
      to make the climb.
