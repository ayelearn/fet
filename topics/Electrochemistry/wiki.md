English chemist John_Daniell (left) and physicist Michael_Faraday (right), both
credited as founders of electrochemistry today.
Electrochemistry is the branch of physical_chemistry that studies the
relationship between electricity, as a measurable and quantitative phenomenon,
and identifiable chemical_change, with either electricity considered an outcome
of a particular chemical change or vice versa. These reactions involve electric
charges moving between electrodes and an electrolyte (or ionic species in a
solution). Thus electrochemistry deals with the interaction between electrical
energy and chemical change.
When a chemical reaction is caused by an externally supplied current, as in
electrolysis, or if an electric current is produced by a spontaneous chemical
reaction as in a battery, it is called an electrochemical reaction. Chemical
reactions where electrons are transferred directly between molecules and/or
atoms are called oxidation-reduction or (redox) reactions. In general,
electrochemistry describes the overall reactions when individual redox
reactions are separate but connected by an external electric circuit and an
intervening electrolyte.

***** History[edit] *****
Main article: History_of_electrochemistry
**** 16th-to-18th-century developments[edit] ****
German physicist Otto_von_Guericke beside his electrical generator while
conducting an experiment.
Understanding of electrical matters began in the sixteenth century. During this
century, the English scientist William_Gilbert spent 17 years experimenting
with magnetism and, to a lesser extent, electricity. For his work on magnets,
Gilbert became known as the "Father of Magnetism." He discovered various
methods for producing and strengthening magnets.[1]
In 1663, the German physicist Otto_von_Guericke created the first electric
generator, which produced static electricity by applying friction in the
machine. The generator was made of a large sulfur ball cast inside a glass
globe, mounted on a shaft. The ball was rotated by means of a crank and an
electric_spark was produced when a pad was rubbed against the ball as it
rotated. The globe could be removed and used as source for experiments with
electricity.[2]
By the midâ18th century the French chemist Charles_FranÃ§ois_de_Cisternay_du
Fay had discovered two types of static electricity, and that like charges repel
each other whilst unlike charges attract. Du Fay announced that electricity
consisted of two fluids: "vitreous" (from the Latin for "glass"), or positive,
electricity; and "resinous," or negative, electricity. This was the two-fluid
theory_of_electricity, which was to be opposed by Benjamin_Franklin's one-fluid
theory later in the century.[3]
Late 1780s diagram of Galvani's experiment on frog legs.
In 1785, Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb developed the law of electrostatic
attraction as an outgrowth of his attempt to investigate the law of electrical
repulsions as stated by Joseph_Priestley in England.[4]
Italian physicist Alessandro_Volta showing his "battery" to French emperor
Napoleon_Bonaparte in the early 19th century.
In the late 18th century the Italian physician and anatomist Luigi_Galvani
marked the birth of electrochemistry by establishing a bridge between chemical
reactions and electricity on his essay "De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu
Musculari Commentarius" (Latin for Commentary on the Effect of Electricity on
Muscular Motion) in 1791 where he proposed a "nerveo-electrical substance" on
biological life forms.[5]
In his essay Galvani concluded that animal tissue contained a here-to-fore
neglected innate, vital force, which he termed "animal electricity," which
activated nerves and muscles spanned by metal probes. He believed that this new
force was a form of electricity in addition to the "natural" form produced by
lightning or by the electric_eel and torpedo_ray as well as the "artificial"
form produced by friction (i.e., static electricity).[6]
Galvani's scientific colleagues generally accepted his views, but Alessandro
Volta rejected the idea of an "animal electric fluid," replying that the frog's
legs responded to differences in metal_temper, composition, and bulk.[5][6]
Galvani refuted this by obtaining muscular action with two pieces of the same
material.
**** 19th century[edit] ****
Sir Humphry Davy's portrait in the 19th century.
In 1800, William_Nicholson and Johann_Wilhelm_Ritter succeeded in decomposing
water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis. Soon thereafter Ritter
discovered the process of electroplating. He also observed that the amount of
metal deposited and the amount of oxygen produced during an electrolytic
process depended on the distance between the electrodes.[7] By 1801, Ritter
observed thermoelectric_currents and anticipated the discovery of
thermoelectricity by Thomas_Johann_Seebeck.[8]
By the 1810s, William_Hyde_Wollaston made improvements to the galvanic_cell.
Sir Humphry_Davy's work with electrolysis led to the conclusion that the
production of electricity in simple electrolytic_cells resulted from chemical
action and that chemical combination occurred between substances of opposite
charge. This work led directly to the isolation of sodium and potassium from
their compounds and of the alkaline_earth_metals from theirs in 1808.[9]
Hans_Christian_Ãrsted's discovery of the magnetic effect of electric currents
in 1820 was immediately recognized as an epoch-making advance, although he left
further work on electromagnetism to others. AndrÃ©-Marie_AmpÃ¨re quickly
repeated Ãrsted's experiment, and formulated them mathematically.[10]
In 1821, Estonian-German physicist Thomas_Johann_Seebeck demonstrated the
electrical potential in the juncture points of two dissimilar metals when there
is a heat difference between the joints.[11]
In 1827, the German scientist Georg_Ohm expressed his law in this famous book
"Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet" (The Galvanic Circuit
Investigated Mathematically) in which he gave his complete theory of
electricity.[11]
In 1832, Michael_Faraday's experiments led him to state his two laws of
electrochemistry. In 1836, John_Daniell invented a primary cell which solved
the problem of polarization by eliminating hydrogen gas generation at the
positive electrode. Later results revealed that alloying the amalgamated zinc
with mercury would produce a higher voltage.
Swedish chemist Svante_Arrhenius portrait circa 1880s.
William_Grove produced the first fuel_cell in 1839. In 1846, Wilhelm_Weber
developed the electrodynamometer. In 1868, Georges_LeclanchÃ© patented a new
cell which eventually became the forerunner to the world's first widely used
battery, the zinc_carbon_cell.[7]
Svante_Arrhenius published his thesis in 1884 on Recherches sur la
conductibilitÃ© galvanique des Ã©lectrolytes (Investigations on the galvanic
conductivity of electrolytes). From his results the author concluded that
electrolytes, when dissolved in water, become to varying degrees split or
dissociated into electrically opposite positive and negative ions.[12]
In 1886, Paul_HÃ©roult and Charles_M._Hall developed an efficient method (the
HallâHÃ©roult_process) to obtain aluminium using electrolysis of molten
alumina.[13]
In 1894, Friedrich_Ostwald concluded important studies of the conductivity and
electrolytic dissociation of organic_acids.[14]
German scientist Walther_Nernst portrait in the 1910s.
Walther_Hermann_Nernst developed the theory of the electromotive_force of the
voltaic cell in 1888. In 1889, he showed how the characteristics of the current
produced could be used to calculate the free_energy change in the chemical
reaction producing the current. He constructed an equation, known as Nernst
equation, which related the voltage of a cell to its properties.[15]
In 1898, Fritz_Haber showed that definite reduction products can result from
electrolytic processes if the potential at the cathode is kept constant. In
1898, he explained the reduction of nitrobenzene in stages at the cathode and
this became the model for other similar reduction processes.[16]
**** 20th century and recent developments[edit] ****
In 1902, The_Electrochemical_Society (ECS) was founded.[17]
In 1909, Robert_Andrews_Millikan began a series of experiments (see oil_drop
experiment) to determine the electric charge carried by a single electron.[18]
In 1923, Johannes_Nicolaus_BrÃ¸nsted and Martin_Lowry published essentially the
same theory about how acids and bases behave, using an electrochemical basis.
[19]
In 1937, Arne_Tiselius developed the first sophisticated electrophoretic
apparatus. Some years later, he was awarded the 1948 Nobel_Prize for his work
in protein electrophoresis.[20]
A year later, in 1949, the International_Society_of_Electrochemistry (ISE) was
founded.[21]
By the 1960sâ1970s quantum_electrochemistry was developed by Revaz_Dogonadze
and his pupils.
***** Principles[edit] *****
**** Oxidation and reduction[edit] ****
Main article: Redox
The term "redox" stands for reduction-oxidation. It refers to electrochemical
processes involving electron transfer to or from a molecule or ion changing its
oxidation_state. This reaction can occur through the application of an external
voltage or through the release of chemical energy. Oxidation and reduction
describe the change of oxidation state that takes place in the atoms, ions or
molecules involved in an electrochemical reaction. Formally, oxidation state is
the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of
different elements were 100% ionic. An atom or ion that gives up an electron to
another atom or ion has its oxidation state increase, and the recipient of the
negatively charged electron has its oxidation state decrease.
For example, when atomic sodium reacts with atomic chlorine, sodium donates one
electron and attains an oxidation state of +1. Chlorine accepts the electron
and its oxidation state is reduced to â1. The sign of the oxidation state
(positive/negative) actually corresponds to the value of each ion's electronic
charge. The attraction of the differently charged sodium and chlorine ions is
the reason they then form an ionic_bond.
The loss of electrons from an atom or molecule is called oxidation, and the
gain of electrons is reduction. This can be easily remembered through the use
of mnemonic devices. Two of the most popular are "OIL RIG" (Oxidation Is Loss,
Reduction Is Gain) and "LEO" the lion says "GER" (Lose Electrons: Oxidation,
Gain Electrons: Reduction). Oxidation and reduction always occur in a paired
fashion such that one species is oxidized when another is reduced. For cases
where electrons are shared (covalent bonds) between atoms with large
differences in electronegativity, the electron is assigned to the atom with the
largest electronegativity in determining the oxidation state.
The atom or molecule which loses electrons is known as the reducing_agent, or
reductant, and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the
oxidizing_agent, or oxidant. Thus, the oxidizing agent is always being reduced
in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common
oxidizing agent, but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction
does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a fire can be fed by an
oxidant other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine
is an even stronger oxidant (it has a higher electronegativity and thus accepts
electrons even better) than oxygen.
For reactions involving oxygen, the gain of oxygen implies the oxidation of the
atom or molecule to which the oxygen is added (and the oxygen is reduced). In
organic compounds, such as butane or ethanol, the loss of hydrogen implies
oxidation of the molecule from which it is lost (and the hydrogen is reduced).
This follows because the hydrogen donates its electron in covalent bonds with
non-metals but it takes the electron along when it is lost. Conversely, loss of
oxygen or gain of hydrogen implies reduction.
**** Balancing redox reactions[edit] ****
Main article: Chemical_equation
Electrochemical reactions in water are better understood by balancing redox
reactions using the ion-electron_method where H+, OHâ ion, H2O and electrons
(to compensate the oxidation changes) are added to cell's half-reactions for
oxidation and reduction.
*** Acidic medium[edit] ***
In acid medium H+ ions and water are added to half-reactions to balance the
overall reaction. For example, when manganese reacts with sodium_bismuthate.
      Unbalanced reaction: Mn2+(aq) + NaBiO3(s) â Bi3+(aq) + MnO4â(aq)
      Oxidation: 4 H2O(l) + Mn2+(aq) â MnO4â(aq) + 8 H+(aq) + 5 eâ
      Reduction: 2 eâ + 6 H+(aq) + BiO3â(s) â Bi3+(aq) + 3 H2O(l)
Finally, the reaction is balanced by multiplying the number of electrons from
the reduction half reaction to oxidation half reaction and vice versa and
adding both half reactions, thus solving the equation.
      8 H2O(l) + 2 Mn2+(aq) â 2 MnO4â(aq) + 16 H+(aq) + 10 eâ
      10 eâ + 30 H+(aq) + 5 BiO3â(s) â 5 Bi3+(aq) + 15 H2O(l)
Reaction balanced:
      14 H+(aq) + 2 Mn2+(aq) + 5 NaBiO3(s) â 7 H2O(l) + 2 MnO4â(aq) + 5
      Bi3+(aq) + 5 Na+(aq)
*** Basic medium[edit] ***
In basic medium OHâ ions and water are added to half reactions to balance the
overall reaction. For example, on reaction between potassium_permanganate and
sodium_sulfite.
      Unbalanced reaction: KMnO4 + Na2SO3 + H2O â MnO2 + Na2SO4 + KOH
      Reduction: 3 eâ + 2 H2O + MnO4â â MnO2 + 4 OHâ
      Oxidation: 2 OHâ + SO32â â SO42â + H2O + 2 eâ
The same procedure as followed on acid medium by multiplying electrons to
opposite half reactions solve the equation thus balancing the overall reaction.
      6 eâ + 4 H2O + 2 MnO4â â 2 MnO2 + 8 OHâ
      6 OHâ + 3 SO32â â 3 SO42â + 3 H2O + 6eâ
Equation balanced:
      2 KMnO4 + 3 Na2SO3 + H2O â 2 MnO2 + 3 Na2SO4 + 2 KOH
*** Neutral medium[edit] ***
The same procedure as used on acid medium is applied, for example on balancing
using electron ion method to complete_combustion of propane.
      Unbalanced reaction: C3H8 + O2 â CO2 + H2O
      Reduction: 4 H+ + O2 + 4 eâ â 2 H2O
      Oxidation: 6 H2O + C3H8 â 3 CO2 + 20 eâ + 20 H+
As in acid and basic medium, electrons which were used to compensate oxidation
changes are multiplied to opposite half reactions, thus solving the equation.
      20 H+ + 5 O2 + 20 eâ â 10 H2O
      6 H2O + C3H8 â 3 CO2 + 20 eâ + 20 H+
Equation balanced:
      C3H8 + 5 O2 â 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
***** Electrochemical cells[edit] *****
Main article: Electrochemical_cell
An electrochemical cell is a device that produces an electric current from
energy released by a spontaneous redox reaction, this can be caused from
electricity. This kind of cell includes the Galvanic_cell or Voltaic cell,
named after Luigi_Galvani and Alessandro_Volta, both scientists who conducted
several experiments on chemical reactions and electric current during the late
18th century.
Electrochemical cells have two conductive electrodes (the anode and the
cathode). The anode is defined as the electrode where oxidation occurs and the
cathode is the electrode where the reduction takes place. Electrodes can be
made from any sufficiently conductive materials, such as metals,
semiconductors, graphite, and even conductive_polymers. In between these
electrodes is the electrolyte, which contains ions that can freely move.
The galvanic cell uses two different metal electrodes, each in an electrolyte
where the positively charged ions are the oxidized form of the electrode metal.
One electrode will undergo oxidation (the anode) and the other will undergo
reduction (the cathode). The metal of the anode will oxidize, going from an
oxidation state of 0 (in the solid form) to a positive oxidation state and
become an ion. At the cathode, the metal ion in solution will accept one or
more electrons from the cathode and the ion's oxidation state is reduced to 0.
This forms a solid metal that electrodeposits on the cathode. The two
electrodes must be electrically connected to each other, allowing for a flow of
electrons that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to
the ions at the surface of the cathode. This flow of electrons is an electric
current that can be used to do work, such as turn a motor or power a light.
A galvanic cell whose electrodes are zinc and copper submerged in zinc_sulfate
and copper_sulfate, respectively, is known as a Daniell_cell.[22]
Half reactions for a Daniell cell are these:[22]
      Zinc electrode (anode): Zn(s) â Zn2+(aq) + 2 eâ
      Copper electrode (cathode): Cu2+(aq) + 2 eâ â Cu(s)
A modern cell stand for electrochemical research. The electrodes attach to
high-quality metallic wires, and the stand is attached to a potentiostat/
galvanostat (not pictured). A shot_glass-shaped container is aerated with a
noble gas and sealed with the Teflon block.
In this example, the anode is the zinc metal which is oxidized (loses
electrons) to form zinc ions in solution, and copper ions accept electrons from
the copper metal electrode and the ions deposit at the copper cathode as an
electrodeposit. This cell forms a simple battery as it will spontaneously
generate a flow of electric current from the anode to the cathode through the
external connection. This reaction can be driven in reverse by applying a
voltage, resulting in the deposition of zinc metal at the anode and formation
of copper ions at the cathode.[22]
To provide a complete electric circuit, there must also be an ionic conduction
path between the anode and cathode electrolytes in addition to the electron
conduction path. The simplest ionic conduction path is to provide a liquid
junction. To avoid mixing between the two electrolytes, the liquid junction can
be provided through a porous plug that allows ion flow while reducing
electrolyte mixing. To further minimize mixing of the electrolytes, a salt
bridge can be used which consists of an electrolyte saturated gel in an
inverted U-tube. As the negatively charged electrons flow in one direction
around this circuit, the positively charged metal ions flow in the opposite
direction in the electrolyte.
A voltmeter is capable of measuring the change of electrical_potential between
the anode and the cathode.
Electrochemical cell voltage is also referred to as electromotive_force or emf.
A cell diagram can be used to trace the path of the electrons in the
electrochemical cell. For example, here is a cell diagram of a Daniell cell:
      Zn(s) | Zn2+ (1M) || Cu2+ (1M) | Cu(s)
First, the reduced form of the metal to be oxidized at the anode (Zn) is
written. This is separated from its oxidized form by a vertical line, which
represents the limit between the phases (oxidation changes). The double
vertical lines represent the saline bridge on the cell. Finally, the oxidized
form of the metal to be reduced at the cathode, is written, separated from its
reduced form by the vertical line. The electrolyte concentration is given as it
is an important variable in determining the cell potential.
***** Standard electrode potential[edit] *****
Main article: Standard_electrode_potential
To allow prediction of the cell potential, tabulations of standard_electrode
potential are available. Such tabulations are referenced to the standard
hydrogen electrode (SHE). The standard_hydrogen_electrode undergoes the
reaction
      2 H+(aq) + 2 eâ â H2
which is shown as reduction but, in fact, the SHE can act as either the anode
or the cathode, depending on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of the
other electrode/electrolyte combination. The term standard in SHE requires a
supply of hydrogen gas bubbled through the electrolyte at a pressure of 1 atm
and an acidic electrolyte with H+ activity equal to 1 (usually assumed to be
[H+] = 1 mol/liter).
The SHE electrode can be connected to any other electrode by a salt bridge to
form a cell. If the second electrode is also at standard conditions, then the
measured cell potential is called the standard electrode potential for the
electrode. The standard electrode potential for the SHE is zero, by definition.
The polarity of the standard electrode potential provides information about the
relative reduction potential of the electrode compared to the SHE. If the
electrode has a positive potential with respect to the SHE, then that means it
is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the SHE to be the anode (an
example is Cu in aqueous CuSO4 with a standard electrode potential of 0.337 V).
Conversely, if the measured potential is negative, the electrode is more
oxidizing than the SHE (such as Zn in ZnSO4 where the standard electrode
potential is â0.76 V).[22]
Standard electrode potentials are usually tabulated as reduction potentials.
However, the reactions are reversible and the role of a particular electrode in
a cell depends on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of both
electrodes. The oxidation potential for a particular electrode is just the
negative of the reduction potential. A standard cell potential can be
determined by looking up the standard electrode potentials for both electrodes
(sometimes called half cell potentials). The one that is smaller will be the
anode and will undergo oxidation. The cell potential is then calculated as the
sum of the reduction potential for the cathode and the oxidation potential for
the anode.
      EÂ°cell = EÂ°red (cathode) â EÂ°red (anode) = EÂ°red (cathode) + EÂ°oxi
      (anode)
For example, the standard electrode potential for a copper electrode is:
      Cell diagram
      Pt(s) | H2 (1 atm) | H+ (1 M) || Cu2+ (1 M) | Cu(s)
      EÂ°cell = EÂ°red (cathode) â EÂ°red (anode)
At standard temperature, pressure and concentration conditions, the cell's emf
(measured by a multimeter) is 0.34 V. By definition, the electrode potential
for the SHE is zero. Thus, the Cu is the cathode and the SHE is the anode
giving
      Ecell = EÂ°(Cu2+/Cu) â EÂ°(H+/H2)
Or,
      EÂ°(Cu2+/Cu) = 0.34 V
Changes in the stoichiometric_coefficients of a balanced cell equation will not
change EÂ°red value because the standard electrode potential is an intensive
property.
***** Spontaneity of redox reaction[edit] *****
Main article: Spontaneous_process
During operation of electrochemical_cells, chemical_energy is transformed into
electrical_energy and is expressed mathematically as the product of the cell's
emf and the electric_charge transferred through the external circuit.
      Electrical energy = EcellCtrans
where Ecell is the cell potential measured in volts (V) and Ctrans is the cell
current integrated over time and measured in coulombs (C); Ctrans can also be
determined by multiplying the total number of electrons transferred (measured
in moles) times Faraday's_constant (F).
The emf of the cell at zero current is the maximum possible emf. It is used to
calculate the maximum possible electrical energy that could be obtained from a
chemical_reaction. This energy is referred to as electrical_work and is
expressed by the following equation:
          W  m a x   =  W  e l e c t r i c a l   = &#x2212; n F  E  c e l l
      {\displaystyle W_{max}=W_{electrical}=-nFE_{cell}}  [W_{max} = W_
      {electrical} = -nFE_{cell} ],
where work is defined as positive into the system.
Since the free_energy is the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from
a system, one can write:[23]
         &#x0394; G = &#x2212; n F  E  c e l l     {\displaystyle \Delta G=-
      nFE_{cell}}  [\Delta G = -nFE_{cell} ]
A positive cell potential gives a negative change in Gibbs free energy. This is
consistent with the cell production of an electric_current from the cathode to
the anode through the external circuit. If the current is driven in the
opposite direction by imposing an external potential, then work is done on the
cell to drive electrolysis.[23]
A spontaneous electrochemical reaction (change in Gibbs free energy less than
zero) can be used to generate an electric current in electrochemical cells.
This is the basis of all batteries and fuel_cells. For example, gaseous oxygen
(O2) and hydrogen (H2) can be combined in a fuel cell to form water and energy,
typically a combination of heat and electrical energy.[23]
Conversely, non-spontaneous electrochemical reactions can be driven forward by
the application of a current at sufficient voltage. The electrolysis of water
into gaseous oxygen and hydrogen is a typical example.
The relation between the equilibrium_constant, K, and the Gibbs free energy for
an electrochemical cell is expressed as follows:
         &#x0394;  G  &#x2218;   = &#x2212; R T ln &#x2061; K = &#x2212; n F  E
      c e l l   &#x2218;     {\displaystyle \Delta G^{\circ }=-RT\ln K=-nFE_
      {cell}^{\circ }}  [\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K = -nFE^{\circ}_{cell} ].
Rearranging to express the relation between standard potential and equilibrium
constant yields
          E  c e l l   o   =    R T   n F    ln &#x2061; K   {\displaystyle E_
      {cell}^{o}={\frac {RT}{nF}}\ln K}  [E^{o}_{cell} = \frac{RT}{nF}\ln K].
The previous equation can use Briggsian_logarithm as shown below:
          E  c e l l   o   =    0.05916   V   n   log &#x2061; K
      {\displaystyle E_{cell}^{o}={\frac {0.05916\,\mathrm {V} }{n}}\log K}  [
      {\displaystyle E_{cell}^{o}={\frac {0.05916\,\mathrm {V} }{n}}\log K}]
***** Cell emf dependency on changes in concentration[edit] *****
**** Nernst equation[edit] ****
Main article: Nernst_equation
The standard potential of an electrochemical cell requires standard conditions
(ÎGÂ°) for all of the reactants. When reactant concentrations differ from
standard conditions, the cell potential will deviate from the standard
potential. In the 20th century German chemist Walther_Nernst proposed a
mathematical model to determine the effect of reactant concentration on
electrochemical cell potential.
In the late 19th century, Josiah_Willard_Gibbs had formulated a theory to
predict whether a chemical reaction is spontaneous based on the free energy
         &#x0394; G = &#x0394;  G  &#x2218;   + R T ln &#x2061; Q
      {\displaystyle \Delta G=\Delta G^{\circ }+RT\ln Q}  [\Delta G = \Delta
      G^\circ + RT \ln Q ]
Here ÎG is change in Gibbs_free_energy, ÎGÂ° is the cell potential when Q is
equal to 1, T is absolute temperature (Kelvin), R is the gas_constant and Q is
reaction_quotient which can be found by dividing products by reactants using
only those products and reactants that are aqueous or gaseous.
Gibbs' key contribution was to formalize the understanding of the effect of
reactant concentration on spontaneity.
Based on Gibbs' work, Nernst extended the theory to include the contribution
from electric potential on charged species. As shown in the previous section,
the change in Gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell can be related to
the cell potential. Thus, Gibbs' theory becomes
         n F &#x0394; E = n F &#x0394;  E  &#x2218;   &#x2212; R T ln &#x2061;
      Q   {\displaystyle nF\Delta E=nF\Delta E^{\circ }-RT\ln Q}  [nF\Delta E =
      nF\Delta E^\circ - RT \ln Q]
Here n is the number of electrons/mole product, F is the Faraday_constant
(coulombs/mole), and ÎE is cell_potential.
Finally, Nernst divided through by the amount of charge transferred to arrive
at a new equation which now bears his name:
         &#x0394; E = &#x0394;  E  &#x2218;   &#x2212;    R T   n F    ln
      &#x2061; Q   {\displaystyle \Delta E=\Delta E^{\circ }-{\frac {RT}
      {nF}}\ln Q}  [\Delta E = \Delta E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q ]
Assuming standard conditions (T = 25 Â°C) and R = 8.3145 J/(KÂ·mol), the
equation above can be expressed on baseâ10_logarithm as shown below:[24]
         &#x0394; E = &#x0394;  E  &#x2218;   &#x2212;    0.05916   V   n   log
      &#x2061; Q   {\displaystyle \Delta E=\Delta E^{\circ }-{\frac
      {0.05916\,\mathrm {V} }{n}}\log Q}  [\Delta E = \Delta E^\circ- \frac
      {0.05916 \,\mathrm{V}}{n} \log Q ]
**** Concentration cells[edit] ****
Main article: Concentration_cell
A concentration cell is an electrochemical cell where the two electrodes are
the same material, the electrolytes on the two half-cells involve the same
ions, but the electrolyte concentration differs between the two half-cells.
An example is an electrochemical cell, where two copper electrodes are
submerged in two copper(II)_sulfate solutions, whose concentrations are 0.05 M
and 2.0 M, connected through a salt bridge. This type of cell will generate a
potential that can be predicted by the Nernst equation. Both can undergo the
same chemistry (although the reaction proceeds in reverse at the anode)
      Cu2+(aq) + 2 eâ â Cu(s)
Le_Chatelier's_principle indicates that the reaction is more favorable to
reduction as the concentration of Cu2+ ions increases. Reduction will take
place in the cell's compartment where concentration is higher and oxidation
will occur on the more dilute side.
The following cell diagram describes the cell mentioned above:
      Cu(s) | Cu2+ (0.05 M) || Cu2+ (2.0 M) | Cu(s)
Where the half cell reactions for oxidation and reduction are:
      Oxidation: Cu(s) â Cu2+ (0.05 M) + 2 eâ
      Reduction: Cu2+ (2.0 M) + 2 eâ â Cu(s)
      Overall reaction: Cu2+ (2.0 M) â Cu2+ (0.05 M)
The cell's emf is calculated through Nernst equation as follows:
         E =  E  &#x2218;   &#x2212;    0.05916   V   2   log &#x2061;    [  C
      u  2 +     ]  d i l u t e d     [  C  u  2 +     ]  c o n c e n t r a t e
      d        {\displaystyle E=E^{\circ }-{\frac {0.05916\,\mathrm {V} }
      {2}}\log {\frac {[\mathrm {Cu^{2+}} ]_{diluted}}{[\mathrm {Cu^{2+}} ]_
      {concentrated}}}}  [E = E^\circ - \frac{0.05916 \,\mathrm{V}}{2} \log
      \frac{[\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}]_{diluted}}{[\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}]_{concentrated}} ]
The value of EÂ° in this kind of cell is zero, as electrodes and ions are the
same in both half-cells.
After replacing values from the case mentioned, it is possible to calculate
cell's potential:
         E = 0 &#x2212;    0.05916   V   2   log &#x2061;   0.05 2.0   = 0.0474
      V    {\displaystyle E=0-{\frac {0.05916\,\mathrm {V} }{2}}\log {\frac
      {0.05}{2.0}}=0.0474\,\mathrm {V} }  [E = 0 - \frac{0.05916 \,\mathrm{V}}
      {2} \log \frac{0.05}{2.0} = 0.0474\,\mathrm{V} ]
or by:
         E = 0 &#x2212;    0.0257   V   2   ln &#x2061;   0.05 2.0   = 0.0474
      V    {\displaystyle E=0-{\frac {0.0257\,\mathrm {V} }{2}}\ln {\frac
      {0.05}{2.0}}=0.0474\,\mathrm {V} }  [E = 0 - \frac{0.0257 \,\mathrm{V}}
      {2} \ln \frac{0.05}{2.0}= 0.0474\,\mathrm{V} ]
However, this value is only approximate, as reaction quotient is defined in
terms of ion activities which can be approximated with the concentrations as
calculated here.
The Nernst equation plays an important role in understanding electrical effects
in cells and organelles. Such effects include nerve synapses and cardiac_beat
as well as the resting potential of a somatic cell.
***** Battery[edit] *****
Main article: Battery_(electricity)
Many types of battery have been commercialized and represent an important
practical application of electrochemistry.[25] Early wet_cells powered the
first telegraph and telephone systems, and were the source of current for
electroplating. The zinc-manganese dioxide dry_cell was the first portable,
non-spillable battery type that made flashlights and other portable devices
practical. The mercury_battery using zinc and mercuric oxide provided higher
levels of power and capacity than the original dry cell for early electronic
devices, but has been phased out of common use due to the danger of mercury
pollution from discarded cells.
The leadâacid_battery was the first practical secondary (rechargeable)
battery that could have its capacity replenished from an external source. The
electrochemical reaction that produced current was (to a useful degree)
reversible, allowing electrical energy and chemical energy to be interchanged
as needed. Common lead acid batteries contain a mixture of sulfuric acid and
water, as well as lead plates. The most common mixture used today is 30% acid.
One problem however is if left uncharged acid will crystallize within the lead
plates of the battery rendering it useless. These batteries last an average of
3 years with daily use however it is not unheard of for a lead acid battery to
still be functional after 7â10 years. Lead-acid cells continue to be widely
used in automobiles.
All the preceding types have water-based electrolytes, which limits the maximum
voltage per cell. The freezing of water limits low temperature performance. The
lithium_battery, which does not (and cannot) use water in the electrolyte,
provides improved performance over other types; a rechargeable lithium-ion
battery is an essential part of many mobile devices.
The flow_battery, an experimental type, offers the option of vastly larger
energy capacity because its reactants can be replenished from external
reservoirs. The fuel_cell can turn the chemical energy bound in hydrocarbon
gases or hydrogen directly into electrical energy with much higher efficiency
than any combustion process; such devices have powered many spacecraft and are
being applied to grid_energy_storage for the public power system.
***** Corrosion[edit] *****
Main article: Corrosion
Corrosion is an electrochemical process, which reveals itself in rust or
tarnish on metals like iron or copper and their respective alloys, steel and
brass.
**** Iron corrosion[edit] ****
For iron rust to occur the metal has to be in contact with oxygen and water,
although chemical_reactions for this process are relatively complex and not all
of them are completely understood. It is believed the causes are the following:
Electron transfer (reduction-oxidation)
      One area on the surface of the metal acts as the anode, which is where
      the oxidation (corrosion) occurs. At the anode, the metal gives up
      electrons.
            Fe(s) â Fe2+(aq) + 2 eâ
      Electrons are transferred from iron, reducing oxygen in the atmosphere
      into water on the cathode, which is placed in another region of the
      metal.
            O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 eâ â 2 H2O(l)
      Global reaction for the process:
            2 Fe(s) + O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) â 2 Fe2+(aq) + 2 H2O(l)
      Standard emf for iron rusting:
            EÂ° = EÂ° (cathode) â EÂ° (anode)
            EÂ° = 1.23V â (â0.44 V) = 1.67 V
Iron corrosion takes place in an acid medium; H+ ions come from reaction
between carbon_dioxide in the atmosphere and water, forming carbonic_acid. Fe2+
ions oxidize, following this equation:
          4   Fe   ( aq )    2 +     +  O  2  ( g )         +  ( 4  + 2    x
      )   H  2       O   ( l )       &#x27F6; 2   Fe  2       O  3
      &#x22C5;   x    H  2      O   + 8   H   ( aq )    +      {\displaystyle
      {\ce {4Fe^{2}+_{(aq)}{}+O2_{(g)}{}+(4+2{\mathit {x}})H2O_{(l)}->2Fe2O3.
      {\mathit {x}}H2O{}+8H+_{(aq)}}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {4Fe^{2}+_{(aq)}
      {}+O2_{(g)}{}+(4+2{\mathit {x}})H2O_{(l)}->2Fe2O3.{\mathit {x}}H2O{}+8H+_
      {(aq)}}}}]
Iron(III)_oxide hydrate is known as rust. The concentration of water associated
with iron oxide varies, thus the chemical formula is represented by      2   Fe
2       O  3      &#x22C5;   x    H  2      O    {\displaystyle {\ce {2Fe2O3.
{\mathit {x}}H2O}}}  [{\displaystyle {\ce {2Fe2O3.{\mathit {x}}H2O}}}].
An electric_circuit is formed as passage of electrons and ions occurs, thus if
an electrolyte is present it will facilitate oxidation, explaining why rusting
is quicker in salt_water.
**** Corrosion of common metals[edit] ****
Coinage_metals, such as copper and silver, slowly corrode through use. A patina
of green-blue copper_carbonate forms on the surface of copper with exposure to
the water and carbon dioxide in the air. Silver coins or cutlery that are
exposed to high sulfur foods such as eggs or the low levels of sulfur species
in the air develop a layer of black Silver_sulfide.
Gold and platinum are extremely difficult to oxidize under normal
circumstances, and require exposure to a powerful chemical oxidizing agent such
as aqua_regia.
Some common metals oxidize extremely rapidly in air. Titanium and aluminium
oxidize instantaneously in contact with the oxygen in the air. These metals
form an extremely thin layer of oxidized metal on the surface which bonds with
the underlying metal. This thin layer of oxide protects the underlying layers
of the metal from the air preventing the entire metal from oxidizing. These
metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. Iron,
in contrast, has an oxide that forms in air and water, called rust, that does
not bond with the iron and therefore does not stop the further oxidation of the
iron. Thus iron left exposed to air and water will continue to rust until all
of the iron is oxided.
**** Prevention of corrosion[edit] ****
Attempts to save a metal from becoming anodic are of two general types. Anodic
regions dissolve and destroy the structural integrity of the metal.
While it is almost impossible to prevent anode/cathode formation, if a non-
conducting material covers the metal, contact with the electrolyte is not
possible and corrosion will not occur.
*** Coating[edit] ***
Metals can be coated with paint or other less conductive metals (passivation).
This prevents the metal surface from being exposed to electrolytes. Scratches
exposing the metal substrate will result in corrosion. The region under the
coating adjacent to the scratch acts as the anode of the reaction.
See Anodizing
*** Sacrificial anodes[edit] ***
Main article: Sacrificial_anode
A method commonly used to protect a structural metal is to attach a metal which
is more anodic than the metal to be protected. This forces the structural metal
to be cathodic, thus spared corrosion. It is called "sacrificial" because the
anode dissolves and has to be replaced periodically.
Zinc bars are attached to various locations on steel ship hulls to render the
ship hull cathodic. The zinc bars are replaced periodically. Other metals, such
as magnesium, would work very well but zinc is the least expensive useful
metal.
To protect pipelines, an ingot of buried or exposed magnesium (or zinc) is
buried beside the pipeline and is connected_electrically to the pipe above
ground. The pipeline is forced to be a cathode and is protected from being
oxidized and rusting. The magnesium anode is sacrificed. At intervals new
ingots are buried to replace those lost.
***** Electrolysis[edit] *****
Main article: Electrolysis
The spontaneous redox reactions of a conventional battery produce electricity
through the different chemical potentials of the cathode and anode in the
electrolyte. However, electrolysis requires an external source of electrical
energy to induce a chemical reaction, and this process takes place in a
compartment called an electrolytic_cell.
**** Electrolysis of molten sodium chloride[edit] ****
When molten, the salt sodium_chloride can be electrolyzed to yield metallic
sodium and gaseous chlorine. Industrially this process takes place in a special
cell named Down's cell. The cell is connected to an electrical power supply,
allowing electrons to migrate from the power supply to the electrolytic cell.
[26]
Reactions that take place at Down's cell are the following:[26]
      Anode (oxidation): 2 Clâ â Cl2(g) + 2 eâ
      Cathode (reduction): 2 Na+(l) + 2 eâ â 2 Na(l)
      Overall reaction: 2 Na+ + 2 Clâ(l) â 2 Na(l) + Cl2(g)
This process can yield large amounts of metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine,
and is widely used on mineral_dressing and metallurgy industries.
The emf for this process is approximately â4 V indicating a (very) non-
spontaneous process. In order for this reaction to occur the power supply
should provide at least a potential of 4 V. However, larger voltages must be
used for this reaction to occur at a high rate.
**** Electrolysis of water[edit] ****
Main article: Electrolysis_of_water
Water can be converted to its component elemental gasses, H2 and O2 through the
application of an external voltage. Water doesn't decompose into hydrogen and
oxygen spontaneously as the Gibbs_free_energy for the process at standard
conditions is about 474.4 kJ. The decomposition of water into hydrogen and
oxygen can be performed in an electrolytic cell. In it, a pair of inert
electrodes usually made of platinum immersed in water act as anode and cathode
in the electrolytic process. The electrolysis starts with the application of an
external voltage between the electrodes. This process will not occur except at
extremely high voltages without an electrolyte such as sodium_chloride or
sulfuric_acid (most used 0.1 M).[27]
Bubbles from the gases will be seen near both electrodes. The following half
reactions describe the process mentioned above:
      Anode (oxidation): 2 H2O(l) â O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 eâ
      Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O(g) + 2 eâ â H2(g) + 2 OHâ(aq)
      Overall reaction: 2 H2O(l) â 2 H2(g) + O2(g)
Although strong acids may be used in the apparatus, the reaction will not net
consume the acid. While this reaction will work at any conductive electrode at
a sufficiently large potential, platinum catalyzes both hydrogen and oxygen
formation, allowing for relatively mild voltages (~2 V depending on the pH).
[27]
**** Electrolysis of aqueous solutions[edit] ****
Electrolysis in an aqueous solution is a similar process as mentioned in
electrolysis of water. However, it is considered to be a complex process
because the contents in solution have to be analyzed in half_reactions, whether
reduced or oxidized.
*** Electrolysis of a solution of sodium chloride[edit] ***
The presence of water in a solution of sodium_chloride must be examined in
respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. Usually, water is
electrolysed as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding gaseous oxygen in
the anode and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. On the other hand, sodium
chloride in water dissociates in Na+ and Clâ ions, cation, which is the
positive ion, will be attracted to the cathode (-), thus reducing the sodium
ion. The anion will then be attracted to the anode (+) oxidizing chloride ion.
[28]
The following half reactions describes the process mentioned:[28]
      1. Cathode: Na+(aq) + eâ â Na(s)     EÂ°red = â2.71 V
      2. Anode: 2 Clâ(aq) â Cl2(g) + 2 eâ     EÂ°red = +1.36 V
      3. Cathode: 2 H2O(l) + 2 eâ â H2(g) + 2 OHâ(aq)    EÂ°red = â0.83
      V
      4. Anode: 2 H2O(l) â O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 eâ    EÂ°red = +1.23 V
Reaction 1 is discarded as it has the most negative value on standard reduction
potential thus making it less thermodynamically favorable in the process.
When comparing the reduction potentials in reactions 2 and 4, the reduction of
chloride ion is favored. Thus, if the Clâ ion is favored for reduction, then
the water reaction is favored for oxidation producing gaseous oxygen, however
experiments show gaseous chlorine is produced and not oxygen.
Although the initial analysis is correct, there is another effect that can
happen, known as the overvoltage_effect. Additional voltage is sometimes
required, beyond the voltage predicted by the EÂ°cell. This may be due to
kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven
that the activation_energy for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in
kinetic_terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is
thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to
make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the voltage of the
external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).[28]
Finally, reaction 3 is favorable because it describes the proliferation of
OHâ ions thus letting a probable reduction of H+ ions less favorable an
option.
The overall reaction for the process according to the analysis would be the
following:[28]
      Anode (oxidation): 2 Clâ(aq) â Cl2(g) + 2 eâ
      Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O(l) + 2 eâ â H2(g) + 2 OHâ(aq)
      Overall reaction: 2 H2O + 2 Clâ(aq) â H2(g) + Cl2(g) + 2 OHâ(aq)
As the overall reaction indicates, the concentration of chloride ions is
reduced in comparison to OHâ ions (whose concentration increases). The
reaction also shows the production of gaseous hydrogen, chlorine and aqueous
sodium_hydroxide.
**** Quantitative electrolysis and Faraday's laws[edit] ****
Main article: Faraday's_law_of_electrolysis
Quantitative aspects of electrolysis were originally developed by Michael
Faraday in 1834. Faraday is also credited to have coined the terms electrolyte,
electrolysis, among many others while he studied quantitative analysis of
electrochemical reactions. Also he was an advocate of the law_of_conservation
of_energy.
*** First law[edit] ***
Faraday concluded after several experiments on electric_current in non-
spontaneous_process, the mass of the products yielded on the electrodes was
proportional to the value of current supplied to the cell, the length of time
the current existed, and the molar mass of the substance analyzed. In other
words, the amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an electrolytic
cell is directly proportional to the quantity_of_electricity passed through the
cell.[29]
Below is a simplified equation of Faraday's first law:
         m =   1  96485  ( C &#x22C5; m o  l  &#x2212; 1   )     &#x22C5;    Q
      M  n     {\displaystyle m={\frac {1}{96485\mathrm {(C\cdot mol^{-1})}
      }}\cdot {\frac {QM}{n}}}  [m = \frac{1}{96485 \mathrm{(C\cdot mol^{-1})}}
      \cdot \frac{QM}{n} ]
Where
      m is the mass of the substance produced at the electrode (in grams),
      Q is the total electric charge that passed through the solution (in
      coulombs),
      n is the valence number of the substance as an ion in solution (electrons
      per ion),
      M is the molar mass of the substance (in grams per mole).
*** Second law[edit] ***
Main article: Electroplating
Faraday devised the laws of chemical electrodeposition of metals from solutions
in 1857. He formulated the second law of electrolysis stating "the amounts of
bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary chemical action
have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with them." In other
words, the quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of
electricity are in the ratio of their chemical equivalent_weights.[30]
An important aspect of the second law of electrolysis is electroplating which
together with the first law of electrolysis, has a significant number of
applications in the industry, as when used to protect metals to avoid
corrosion.
***** Applications[edit] *****
There are various extremely important electrochemical processes in both nature
and industry, like the coating[31][32] of objects with metals or metal oxides
through electrodeposition, the addition (electroplating) or removal
(electropolishing) of thin layers of metal from an object's surface[33], and
the detection of alcohol in drunken drivers through the redox reaction of
ethanol. The generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently
an electrochemical process, as is production of metals like aluminum and
titanium from their ores. Certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the
amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. As well as the
established electrochemical technologies (like deep cycle lead acid batteries)
there is also a wide range of new emerging technologies such as fuel cells,
large format lithium-ion batteries, electrochemical reactors and super-
capacitors that are becoming increasingly commercial.[34] Electrochemistry has
also important applications in the food industry, like the assessment of food/
package interactions,[35] the analysis of milk composition,[36] the
characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream
mixes, the determination of free acidity in olive_oil.
The action_potentials that travel down connected neurons are based on electric
current generated by the movement of sodium and potassium ions into and out of
cells. Specialized cells in certain animals like the electric_eel can generate
electric currents powerful enough to disable much larger animals.
