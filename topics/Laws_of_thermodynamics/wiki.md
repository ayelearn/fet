The three laws of thermodynamics define physical quantities (temperature,
energy, and entropy) that characterize thermodynamic_systems at thermal
equilibrium. The laws describe how these quantities behave under various
circumstances, and preclude the possibility of certain phenomena (such as
perpetual_motion).
The three laws of thermodynamics are:[1][2][3][4][5]
    * First_law_of_thermodynamics: When energy passes, as work, as heat, or
      with matter, into or out of a system, the system's internal_energy
      changes in accord with the law of conservation_of_energy. Equivalently,
      perpetual_motion_machines_of_the_first_kind (machines that produce work
      with no energy input) are impossible.
    * Second_law_of_thermodynamics: In a natural thermodynamic_process, the sum
      of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic_systems increases.
      Equivalently, perpetual_motion_machines_of_the_second_kind (machines that
      spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work) are
      impossible.
    * Third_law_of_thermodynamics: The entropy of a system approaches a
      constant value as the temperature approaches absolute_zero.[2] With the
      exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses) the entropy of a system at
      absolute zero is typically close to zero.
In addition, there is conventionally added a "zeroth law", which defines
thermal_equilibrium:
    * Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics: If two systems are each in thermal
      equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with
      each other. This law helps define the concept of temperature.
There have been suggestions of additional laws, but none of them achieve the
generality of the four accepted laws, and they are not mentioned in standard
textbooks.[1][2][3][4][6][7]
The laws of thermodynamics are important fundamental laws in physics and they
are applicable in other natural sciences.

***** Zeroth law[edit] *****
The zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics may be stated in the following form:
     If two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system
     then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.[8]
The law is intended to allow the existence of an empirical parameter, the
temperature, as a property of a system such that systems in thermal equilibrium
with each other have the same temperature. The law as stated here is compatible
with the use of a particular physical body, for example a mass of gas, to match
temperatures of other bodies, but does not justify regarding temperature as a
quantity that can be measured on a scale of real numbers.
Though this version of the law is one of the most commonly stated versions, it
is only one of a diversity of statements that are labeled as "the zeroth law"
by competent writers. Some statements go further so as to supply the important
physical fact that temperature is one-dimensional and that one can conceptually
arrange bodies in real number sequence from colder to hotter.[9][10][11]
Perhaps there exists no unique "best possible statement" of the "zeroth law",
because there is in the literature a range of formulations of the principles of
thermodynamics, each of which call for their respectively appropriate versions
of the law.
Although these concepts of temperature and of thermal equilibrium are
fundamental to thermodynamics and were clearly stated in the nineteenth
century, the desire to explicitly number the above law was not widely felt
until Fowler and Guggenheim did so in the 1930s, long after the first, second,
and third law were already widely understood and recognized. Hence it was
numbered the zeroth law. The importance of the law as a foundation to the
earlier laws is that it allows the definition of temperature in a non-circular
way without reference to entropy, its conjugate_variable. Such a temperature
definition is said to be 'empirical'.[12][13][14][15][16][17]
***** First law[edit] *****
The first_law_of_thermodynamics may be stated in several ways :
      The increase in internal_energy of a closed system is equal to the total
      of the energy added to the system. In particular, if the energy entering
      the system is supplied as heat and if energy leaves the system as work,
      the heat is accounted for as positive and the work as negative.
               &#x0394;  U   s y s t e m    = Q &#x2212; W   {\textstyle \Delta
            U_{\rm {system}}=Q-W}  [{\textstyle \Delta U_{\rm {system}}=Q-W}]
      In the case of a thermodynamic_cycle of a closed system, which returns to
      its original state, the heat Qin supplied to the system in one stage of
      the cycle, minus the heat Qout removed from it in another stage of the
      cycle, plus the work added to the system Win equals the work that leaves
      the system Wout.
               &#x0394;  U   s y s t e m  ( f u l l  c y c l e )    = 0
            {\displaystyle \Delta U_{\rm {system\,(full\,cycle)}}=0}  [
            {\displaystyle \Delta U_{\rm {system\,(full\,cycle)}}=0}]
      hence, for a full cycle,
               Q =  Q   i n    &#x2212;  Q   o u t    +  W   i n    &#x2212;  W
            o u t    =  W   n e t      {\displaystyle Q=Q_{\rm {in}}-Q_{\rm
            {out}}+W_{\rm {in}}-W_{\rm {out}}=W_{\rm {net}}}  [{\displaystyle
            Q=Q_{\rm {in}}-Q_{\rm {out}}+W_{\rm {in}}-W_{\rm {out}}=W_{\rm
            {net}}}]
      For the particular case of a thermally isolated system (adiabatically
      isolated), the change of the internal energy of an adiabatically isolated
      system can only be the result of the work added to the system, because
      the adiabatic assumption is: Q = 0.
               &#x0394;  U   s y s t e m    =  U   f i n a l    &#x2212;  U   i
            n i t i a l    =  W   i n    &#x2212;  W   o u t
            {\displaystyle \Delta U_{\rm {system}}=U_{\rm {final}}-U_{\rm
            {initial}}=W_{\rm {in}}-W_{\rm {out}}}  [{\displaystyle \Delta U_
            {\rm {system}}=U_{\rm {final}}-U_{\rm {initial}}=W_{\rm {in}}-W_
            {\rm {out}}}]
More specifically, the First Law encompasses several principles:
    * The law_of_conservation_of_energy.
            This states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed.
            However, energy can change forms, and energy can flow from one
            place to another. A particular consequence of the law of
            conservation of energy is that the total energy of an isolated
            system does not change.
    * The concept of internal_energy and its relationship to temperature.
            If a system has a definite temperature, then its total energy has
            three distinguishable components. If the system is in motion as a
            whole, it has kinetic_energy. If the system as a whole is in an
            externally imposed force field (e.g. gravity), it has potential
            energy relative to some reference point in space. Finally, it has
            internal energy, which is a fundamental quantity of thermodynamics.
            The establishment of the concept of internal energy distinguishes
            the first law of thermodynamics from the more general law of
            conservation of energy.
                E   t o t a l    =   K E    s y s t e m    +   P E    s y s t e
            m    +  U   s y s t e m      {\displaystyle E_{\rm {total}}=\mathrm
            {KE} _{\rm {system}}+\mathrm {PE} _{\rm {system}}+U_{\rm {system}}}
            [{\displaystyle E_{\rm {total}}=\mathrm {KE} _{\rm
            {system}}+\mathrm {PE} _{\rm {system}}+U_{\rm {system}}}]
            The internal energy of a substance can be explained as the sum of
            the diverse kinetic energies of the erratic microscopic motions of
            its constituent atoms, and of the potential energy of interactions
            between them. Those microscopic energy terms are collectively
            called the substance's internal energy (U), and are accounted for
            by macroscopic thermodynamic property. The total of the kinetic
            energies of microscopic motions of the constituent atoms increases
            as the system's temperature increases; this assumes no other
            interactions at the microscopic level of the system such as
            chemical reactions, potential energy of constituent atoms with
            respect to each other.
    * Work is a process of transferring energy to or from a system in ways that
      can be described by macroscopic mechanical forces exerted by factors in
      the surroundings, outside the system. Examples are an externally driven
      shaft agitating a stirrer within the system, or an externally imposed
      electric field that polarizes the material of the system, or a piston
      that compresses the system. Unless otherwise stated, it is customary to
      treat work as occurring without its dissipation to the surroundings.
      Practically speaking, in all natural process, some of the work is
      dissipated by internal friction or viscosity. The work done by the system
      can come from its overall kinetic energy, from its overall potential
      energy, or from its internal energy.
            For example, when a machine (not a part of the system) lifts a
            system upwards, some energy is transferred from the machine to the
            system. The system's energy increases as work is done on the system
            and in this particular case, the energy increase of the system is
            manifested as an increase in the system's gravitational_potential
            energy. Work added to the system increases the Potential Energy of
            the system:
                     W = &#x0394;   P E    s y s t e m      {\displaystyle
                  W=\Delta \mathrm {PE} _{\rm {system}}}  [{\displaystyle
                  W=\Delta \mathrm {PE} _{\rm {system}}}]
            Or in general, the energy added to the system in the form of work
            can be partitioned to kinetic, potential or internal energy forms:
                     W = &#x0394;   K E    s y s t e m    + &#x0394;   P E    s
                  y s t e m    + &#x0394;  U   s y s t e m      {\displaystyle
                  W=\Delta \mathrm {KE} _{\rm {system}}+\Delta \mathrm {PE} _
                  {\rm {system}}+\Delta U_{\rm {system}}}  [{\displaystyle
                  W=\Delta \mathrm {KE} _{\rm {system}}+\Delta \mathrm {PE} _
                  {\rm {system}}+\Delta U_{\rm {system}}}]
    * When matter is transferred into a system, that masses' associated
      internal energy and potential energy are transferred with it.
                       (  u  &#x0394; M  )    i n    = &#x0394;  U   s y s t e
                  m      {\displaystyle \left(u\,\Delta M\right)_{\rm
                  {in}}=\Delta U_{\rm {system}}}  [{\displaystyle \left
                  (u\,\Delta M\right)_{\rm {in}}=\Delta U_{\rm {system}}}]
            where u denotes the internal energy per unit mass of the
            transferred matter, as measured while in the surroundings; and ÎM
            denotes the amount of transferred mass.
    * The flow of heat is a form of energy transfer.
            Heating is a natural process of moving energy to or from a system
            other than by work or the transfer of matter. Direct passage of
            heat is only from a hotter to a colder system.
                  If the system has rigid walls that are impermeable to matter,
                  and consequently energy cannot be transferred as work into or
                  out from the system, and no external long-range force field
                  affects it that could change its internal energy, then the
                  internal energy can only be changed by the transfer of energy
                  as heat:
                     &#x0394;  U   s y s t e m    = Q   {\displaystyle \Delta
                  U_{\rm {system}}=Q}  [{\displaystyle \Delta U_{\rm
                  {system}}=Q}]
where Q denotes the amount of energy transferred into the system as heat.
Combining these principles leads to one traditional statement of the first law
of thermodynamics: it is not possible to construct a machine which will
perpetually output work without an equal amount of energy input to that
machine. Or more briefly, a perpetual motion machine of the first kind is
impossible.
***** Second law[edit] *****
The second_law_of_thermodynamics indicates the irreversibility of natural
processes, and, in many cases, the tendency of natural processes to lead
towards spatial homogeneity of matter and energy, and especially of
temperature. It can be formulated in a variety of interesting and important
ways.
It implies the existence of a quantity called the entropy of a thermodynamic
system. In terms of this quantity it implies that
     When two initially isolated_systems in separate but nearby regions of
     space, each in thermodynamic_equilibrium with itself but not
     necessarily with each other, are then allowed to interact, they will
     eventually reach a mutual thermodynamic equilibrium. The sum of the
     entropies of the initially isolated systems is less than or equal to
     the total entropy of the final combination. Equality occurs just when
     the two original systems have all their respective intensive
     variables (temperature, pressure) equal; then the final system also
     has the same values.
The second law is applicable to a wide variety of processes, reversible and
irreversible. All natural processes are irreversible. Reversible processes are
a useful and convenient theoretical fiction, but do not occur in nature.
A prime example of irreversibility is in the transfer of heat by conduction or
radiation. It was known long before the discovery of the notion of entropy that
when two bodies initially of different temperatures come into thermal
connection, then heat always flows from the hotter body to the colder one.
The second law tells also about kinds of irreversibility other than heat
transfer, for example those of friction and viscosity, and those of chemical
reactions. The notion of entropy is needed to provide that wider scope of the
law.
According to the second law of thermodynamics, in a theoretical and fictive
reversible heat transfer, an element of heat transferred, Î´Q, is the product
of the temperature (T), both of the system and of the sources or destination of
the heat, with the increment (dS) of the system's conjugate variable, its
entropy (S)
         &#x03B4; Q = T  d S  .   {\displaystyle \delta Q=T\,dS\,.}  [\delta
      Q=T\,dS\,.][1]
Entropy may also be viewed as a physical measure of the lack of physical
information about the microscopic details of the motion and configuration of a
system, when only the macroscopic states are known. This lack of information is
often described as disorder on a microscopic or molecular scale. The law
asserts that for two given macroscopically specified states of a system, there
is a quantity called the difference of information entropy between them. This
information entropy difference defines how much additional microscopic physical
information is needed to specify one of the macroscopically specified states,
given the macroscopic specification of the other â often a conveniently
chosen reference state which may be presupposed to exist rather than explicitly
stated. A final condition of a natural process always contains microscopically
specifiable effects which are not fully and exactly predictable from the
macroscopic specification of the initial condition of the process. This is why
entropy increases in natural processes â the increase tells how much extra
microscopic information is needed to distinguish the final macroscopically
specified state from the initial macroscopically specified state.[18]
***** Third law[edit] *****
The third_law_of_thermodynamics is sometimes stated as follows:
      The entropy of a perfect crystal of any pure substance approaches zero as
      the temperature approaches absolute_zero.
At zero temperature the system must be in a state with the minimum thermal
energy. This statement holds true if the perfect crystal has only one state
with_minimum_energy. Entropy is related to the number of possible microstates
according to:
               S =  k   B      l n   &#x03A9;   {\displaystyle S=k_{\mathrm {B}
            }\,\mathrm {ln} \,\Omega }  [S=k_{\mathrm {B} }\,\mathrm {ln}
            \,\Omega ]
Where S is the entropy of the system, kB Boltzmann's_constant, and Î© the
number of microstates (e.g. possible configurations of atoms). At absolute zero
there is only 1 microstate possible (Î©=1 as all the atoms are identical for a
pure substance and as a result all orders are identical as there is only one
combination) and ln(1) = 0.
A more general form of the third law that applies to a system such as a glass
that may have more than one minimum microscopically distinct energy state, or
may have a microscopically distinct state that is "frozen in" though not a
strictly minimum energy state and not strictly speaking a state of
thermodynamic equilibrium, at absolute zero temperature:
      The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature
      approaches zero.
The constant value (not necessarily zero) is called the residual_entropy of the
system.
***** History[edit] *****
See also: Philosophy_of_thermal_and_statistical_physics
Circa_1797,_Count_Rumford_(born_Benjamin_Thompson) showed that endless
mechanical action can generate indefinitely large amounts of heat from a fixed
amount of working substance thus challenging the caloric theory of heat, which
held that there would be a finite amount of caloric heat/energy in a fixed
amount of working substance. The first established thermodynamic principle,
which eventually became the second law of thermodynamics, was formulated by
Sadi_Carnot in 1824. By 1860, as formalized in the works of those such as
Rudolf_Clausius and William_Thomson, two established principles of
thermodynamics had evolved, the first principle and the second principle, later
restated as thermodynamic laws. By 1873, for example, thermodynamicist Josiah
Willard_Gibbs, in his memoir Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids,
clearly stated the first two absolute laws of thermodynamics. Some textbooks
throughout the 20th century have numbered the laws differently. In some fields
removed from chemistry, the second law was considered to deal with the
efficiency of heat engines only, whereas what was called the third law dealt
with entropy increases. Directly defining zero points for entropy calculations
was not considered to be a law. Gradually, this separation was combined into
the second law and the modern third law was widely adopted.
