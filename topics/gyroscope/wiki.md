A gyroscope
A gyroscope in operation. Note the freedom of rotation in all three axes. The
rotor will maintain its spin axis direction regardless of the orientation of
the outer frame.
A gyroscope (from Ancient_Greek Î³á¿¦ÏÎ¿Ï gÃ»ros, "circle" and ÏÎºÎ¿ÏÎ­Ï
skopÃ©Å, "to look") is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation
and angular_velocity.[1][2] It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of
rotation (spin axis) is free to assume any orientation by itself. When
rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting or rotation of
the mounting, according to the conservation_of_angular_momentum.
Gyroscopes based on other operating principles also exist, such as the
microchip-packaged MEMS_gyroscopes found in electronic devices, solid-state
ring_lasers, fibre_optic_gyroscopes, and the extremely sensitive quantum
gyroscope.[3]
Applications of gyroscopes include inertial_navigation_systems, such as in the
Hubble_Telescope, or inside the steel hull of a submerged submarine. Due to
their precision, gyroscopes are also used in gyrotheodolites to maintain
direction in tunnel mining.[4] Gyroscopes can be used to construct
gyrocompasses, which complement or replace magnetic compasses (in ships,
aircraft and spacecraft, vehicles in general), to assist in stability
(bicycles, motorcycles, and ships) or be used as part of an inertial guidance
system.
MEMS gyroscopes are popular in some consumer electronics, such as smartphones.

***** Description and diagram[edit] *****
Diagram of a gyro wheel. Reaction arrows about the output axis (blue)
correspond to forces applied about the input axis (green), and vice versa.
A gyroscope is a wheel mounted in two or three gimbals, which are pivoted
supports that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of
three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used
to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation
remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case
of a gyroscope with two gimbals, the outer gimbal, which is the gyroscope
frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by
the support. This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and
its axis possesses none. The inner gimbal is mounted in the gyroscope frame
(outer gimbal) so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always
perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal). This
inner gimbal has two degrees of rotational freedom.
The axle of the spinning wheel defines the spin axis. The rotor is constrained
to spin about an axis, which is always perpendicular to the axis of the inner
gimbal. So the rotor possesses three degrees of rotational freedom and its axis
possesses two. The wheel responds to a force applied to the input axis by a
reaction force to the output axis.
The behaviour of a gyroscope can be most easily appreciated by consideration of
the front wheel of a bicycle. If the wheel is leaned away from the vertical so
that the top of the wheel moves to the left, the forward rim of the wheel also
turns to the left. In other words, rotation on one axis of the turning wheel
produces rotation of the third axis.
A gyroscope flywheel will roll or resist about the output axis depending upon
whether the output gimbals are of a free or fixed configuration. Examples of
some free-output-gimbal devices would be the attitude_reference gyroscopes used
to sense or measure the pitch, roll and yaw attitude angles in a spacecraft or
aircraft.
Animation of a gyro wheel in action
The centre of gravity of the rotor can be in a fixed position. The rotor
simultaneously spins about one axis and is capable of oscillating about the two
other axes, and it is free to turn in any direction about the fixed point
(except for its inherent resistance caused by rotor spin). Some gyroscopes have
mechanical equivalents substituted for one or more of the elements. For
example, the spinning rotor may be suspended in a fluid, instead of being
mounted in gimbals. A control_moment_gyroscope (CMG) is an example of a fixed-
output-gimbal device that is used on spacecraft to hold or maintain a desired
attitude angle or pointing direction using the gyroscopic resistance force.
In some special cases, the outer gimbal (or its equivalent) may be omitted so
that the rotor has only two degrees of freedom. In other cases, the centre of
gravity of the rotor may be offset from the axis of oscillation, and thus the
centre of gravity of the rotor and the centre of suspension of the rotor may
not coincide.
***** History[edit] *****
Gyroscope invented by LÃ©on Foucault in 1852. Replica built by Dumoulin-Froment
for the Exposition universelle in 1867. National_Conservatory_of_Arts_and
Crafts_museum, Paris.
Essentially, a gyroscope is a top combined with a pair of gimbals. Tops were
invented in many different civilizations, including classical Greece, Rome, and
China.[5] Most of these were not utilized as instruments.
The first known apparatus similar to a gyroscope (the "Whirling Speculum" or
"Serson's Speculum") was invented by John_Serson in 1743. It was used as a
level, to locate the horizon in foggy or misty conditions.
The first instrument used more like an actual gyroscope was made by Johann
Bohnenberger of Germany, who first wrote about it in 1817. At first he called
it the "Machine".[6][7] Bohnenberger's machine was based on a rotating massive
sphere.[8] In 1832, American Walter R. Johnson developed a similar device that
was based on a rotating disc.[9][10] The French mathematician Pierre-Simon
Laplace, working at the Ãcole_Polytechnique in Paris, recommended the machine
for use as a teaching aid, and thus it came to the attention of LÃ©on_Foucault.
[11] In 1852, Foucault used it in an experiment involving the rotation of the
Earth.[12][13] It was Foucault who gave the device its modern name, in an
experiment to see (Greek skopeein, to see) the Earth's rotation (Greek gyros,
circle or rotation),[14] which was visible in the 8 to 10 minutes before
friction slowed the spinning rotor.
In the 1860s, the advent of electric motors made it possible for a gyroscope to
spin indefinitely; this led to the first prototype heading_indicators, and a
rather more complicated device, the gyrocompass. The first functional
gyrocompass was patented in 1904 by German inventor Hermann_AnschÃ¼tz-Kaempfe.
[15] American Elmer_Sperry followed with his own design later that year, and
other nations soon realized the military importance of the invention—in an age
in which naval prowess was the most significant measure of military power—and
created their own gyroscope industries. The Sperry_Gyroscope_Company quickly
expanded to provide aircraft and naval stabilizers as well, and other gyroscope
developers followed suit.[16]
In 1917, the Chandler Company of Indianapolis, created the "Chandler
gyroscope", a toy gyroscope with a pull string and pedestal. Chandler continued
to produce the toy until the company was purchased by TEDCO inc. in 1982. The
chandler toy is still produced by TEDCO today.[17]
In the first several decades of the 20th century, other inventors attempted
(unsuccessfully) to use gyroscopes as the basis for early black_box
navigational systems by creating a stable platform from which accurate
acceleration measurements could be performed (in order to bypass the need for
star sightings to calculate position). Similar principles were later employed
in the development of inertial_navigation_systems for ballistic_missiles.[18]
During World War II, the gyroscope became the prime component for aircraft and
anti-aircraft gun sights.[19] After the war, the race to miniaturize gyroscopes
for guided missiles and weapons navigation systems resulted in the development
and manufacturing of so-called midget gyroscopes that weighed less than 3
ounces (85 g) and had a diameter of approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm). Some of
these miniaturized gyroscopes could reach a speed of 24,000 revolutions per
minute in less than 10 seconds.[20]
Gyroscopes continue to be an engineering challenge. For example, the axle
bearings have to be extremely accurate. A small amount of friction is
deliberately introduced to the bearings, since otherwise an accuracy of better
than      10  &#x2212; 7     {\displaystyle 10^{-7}}  [10^{-7}] of an inch (2.5
nm) would be required.[21]
Three-axis MEMS-based gyroscopes are also being used in portable electronic
devices such as tablets,[22] smartphones,[23] and smartwatches.[24] This adds
to the 3-axis acceleration sensing ability available on previous generations of
devices. Together these sensors provide 6 component motion sensing;
acceleration for X,Y, and Z movement, and gyroscopes for measuring the extent
and rate of rotation in space (roll, pitch and yaw). Some devices (e.g. the
iPhone[25]) additionally incorporate a magnetometer to provide absolute angular
measurements relative to the Earth's magnetic field. Newer MEMS-based_inertial
measurement_units incorporate up to all nine axes of sensing in a single
integrated circuit package, providing inexpensive and widely available motion
sensing.[26]
***** Contemporary uses[edit] *****
**** Steadicam[edit] ****
Main article: Steadicam
A Steadicam rig was employed during the filming of Return_of_the_Jedi, in
conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background
plates for the speeder_bike chase. Steadicam inventor Garrett_Brown operated
the shot, walking through a redwood forest, running the camera at one frame per
second. When projected at 24 frames per second, it gave the impression of
flying through the air at perilous speeds.[27][28]
**** Heading indicator[edit] ****
Main article: Heading_indicator
The heading indicator or directional gyro has an axis of rotation that is set
horizontally, pointing north. Unlike a magnetic compass, it does not seek
north. When being used in an airliner, for example, it will slowly drift away
from north and will need to be reoriented periodically, using a magnetic
compass as a reference.[29]
**** Gyrocompass[edit] ****
Main article: Gyrocompass
Unlike a directional gyro or heading indicator, a gyrocompass seeks north. It
detects the rotation of the Earth about its axis and seeks the true north,
rather than the magnetic north. Gyrocompasses usually have built-in damping to
prevent overshoot when re-calibrating from sudden movement.
**** Accelerometer[edit] ****
Main article: Accelerometer
By determining an object's acceleration and integrating over time, the velocity
of the object can be calculated. Integrating again, position can be determined.
The simplest accelerometer is a weight that is free to move horizontally, which
is attached to a spring and a device to measure the tension in the spring. This
can be improved by introducing a counteracting force to push the weight back
and to measure the force needed to prevent the weight from moving. A more
complicated design consists of a gyroscope with a weight on one of the axes.
The device will react to the force generated by the weight when it is
accelerated, by integrating that force to produce a velocity.[30]
***** Variations[edit] *****
**** Gyrostat[edit] ****
A gyrostat consists of a massive flywheel concealed in a solid casing.[31][32]
Its behaviour on a table, or with various modes of suspension or support,
serves to illustrate the curious reversal of the ordinary laws of static
equilibrium due to the gyrostatic behaviour of the interior invisible flywheel
when rotated rapidly. The first gyrostat was designed by Lord_Kelvin to
illustrate the more complicated state of motion of a spinning body when free to
wander about on a horizontal plane, like a top spun on the pavement, or a
bicycle on the road. Kelvin also made use of gyrostats to develop mechanical
theories of the elasticity of matter and of the ether.[33]. In modern continuum
mechanics there is a variety of these models, based on ideas of Lord Kelvin.
They represent a specific type of Cosserat theories (suggested for the first
time by EugÃ¨ne_Cosserat and FranÃ§ois_Cosserat), which can be used for
description of artificially made smart materials as well as of other complex
media. One of them, so-called Kelvin's medium, has the same equations as
magnetic insulators near the state of magnetic saturation in the approximation
of quasimagnetostatics[34].
In modern times, the gyrostat concept is used in the design of attitude control
systems for orbiting spacecraft and satellites.[35] For instance, the Mir space
station had three pairs of internally mounted flywheels known as gyrodynes or
control moment gyros.[36]
In physics, there are several systems whose dynamical equations resemble the
equations of motion of a gyrostat.[37] Examples include a solid body with a
cavity filled with an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous liquid,[38] the
static equilibrium configuration of a stressed elastic rod in elastica_theory,
[39] the polarization dynamics of a light pulse propagating through a nonlinear
medium,[40] the Lorenz_system in chaos theory,[41] and the motion of an ion in
a Penning_trap mass spectrometer.[42]
**** MEMS Gyroscope[edit] ****
Main article: Vibrating_structure_gyroscope
A microelectromechanical_systems (MEMS) gyroscope are miniaturized gyroscope
found in electronic devices. It takes the idea of the Foucault_pendulum and
uses a vibrating element.
**** HRG[edit] ****
The hemispherical_resonator_gyroscope (HRG), also called wine-glass gyroscope
[contradictory] or mushroom gyro, makes using a thin solid-state hemispherical
shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a flexural resonance
by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly
onto separate fused-quartz structures that surround the shell. Gyroscopic
effect is obtained from the inertial property of the flexural standing waves.
[citation_needed]
**** VSG or CVG[edit] ****
A vibrating_structure_gyroscope (VSG), also called a Coriolis vibratory
gyroscope (CVG),[43] uses a resonator made of different metallic alloys. It
takes a position between the low-accuracy, low-cost MEMS gyroscope and the
higher-accuracy and higher-cost fiber optic gyroscope. Accuracy parameters are
increased by using low-intrinsic damping materials, resonator vacuumization,
and digital electronics to reduce temperature dependent drift and instability
of control signals.[44]
High quality wine-glass_resonators are used for precise sensors like HRG.[45]
**** DTG[edit] ****
A dynamically tuned gyroscope (DTG) is a rotor suspended by a universal joint
with flexure pivots.[46] The flexure spring stiffness is independent of spin
rate. However, the dynamic inertia (from the gyroscopic reaction effect) from
the gimbal provides negative spring stiffness proportional to the square of the
spin speed (Howe and Savet, 1964; Lawrence, 1998). Therefore, at a particular
speed, called the tuning speed, the two moments cancel each other, freeing the
rotor from torque, a necessary condition for an ideal gyroscope.
**** Ring laser gyroscope[edit] ****
Main article: Ring_laser_gyroscope
A ring_laser_gyroscope relies on the Sagnac_effect to measure rotation by
measuring the shifting interference pattern of a beam split into two halves, as
the two halves move around the ring in opposite directions.
When the Boeing_757-200 entered service in 1983, it was equipped with the first
suitable ring laser gyroscope. This gyroscope took many years to develop, and
the experimental models went through many changes before it was deemed ready
for production by the engineers and managers of Honeywell and Boeing. It was an
outcome of the competition with mechanical gyroscopes, which kept improving.
The reason Honeywell, of all companies, chose to develop the laser gyro was
that they were the only one that didn't have a successful line of mechanical
gyroscopes, so they wouldn't be competing against themselves. The first problem
they had to solve was that with laser gyros rotations below a certain minimum
could not be detected at all, due to a problem called "lock-in", whereby the
two beams act like coupled oscillators and pull each other's frequencies toward
convergence and therefore zero output. The solution was to shake the gyro
rapidly so that it never settled into lock-in. Paradoxically, too regular of a
dithering motion produced an accumulation of short periods of lock-in when the
device was at rest at the extremities of its shaking motion. This was cured by
applying a random white_noise to the vibration. The material of the block was
also changed from quartz to a new glass ceramic Cer-Vit, made by Owens_Corning,
because of helium leaks.[47]
**** Fiber optic gyroscope[edit] ****
Main article: Fibre_optic_gyroscope
A fiber_optic_gyroscope also uses the interference of light to detect
mechanical rotation. The two halves of the split beam travel in opposite
directions in a coil of fiber_optic cable as long as 5 km. Like the ring_laser
gyroscope, it makes use of the Sagnac_effect.[48]
**** London moment[edit] ****
A London_moment gyroscope relies on the quantum-mechanical phenomenon, whereby
a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic_field whose axis lines up
exactly with the spin axis of the gyroscopic rotor. A magnetometer determines
the orientation of the generated field, which is interpolated to determine the
axis of rotation. Gyroscopes of this type can be extremely accurate and stable.
For example, those used in the Gravity_Probe_B experiment measured changes in
gyroscope spin axis orientation to better than 0.5 milliarcseconds (1.4Ã10−7
degrees, or about 2.4Ã10â9 radians) over a one-year period.[49] This is
equivalent to an angular_separation the width of a human hair viewed from 32
kilometers (20 mi) away.[50]
The GP-B gyro consists of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating_mass made of
fused_quartz, which provides a dielectric support for a thin layer of niobium
superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings,
the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After
the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the
polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further
reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered,
the extreme rotational_symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the
angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.[51]
A sensitive DC_SQUID that can discriminate changes as small as one quantum, or
about 2 Ã10−15 Wb, is used to monitor the gyroscope. A precession, or tilt, in
the orientation of the rotor causes the London moment magnetic field to shift
relative to the housing. The moving field passes through a superconducting
pickup loop fixed to the housing, inducing a small electric current. The
current produces a voltage across a shunt resistance, which is resolved to
spherical coordinates by a microprocessor. The system is designed to minimize
Lorentz torque on the rotor.[52][53]
***** Consumer electronics[edit] *****
A digital gyroscope module connected to an Arduino_Uno board
Main article: Accelerometer_Â§ Consumer_electronics
In addition to being used in compasses, aircraft, computer pointing devices,
etc., gyroscopes have been introduced into consumer electronics. The first
usage or application of gyroscope in consumer electronics was popularized by
Steve_Jobs in Apple iPhone.
Since the gyroscope allows the calculation of orientation and rotation,
designers have incorporated them into modern technology. The integration of the
gyroscope has allowed for more accurate recognition of movement within a 3D
space than the previous lone accelerometer within a number of smartphones.
Gyroscopes in consumer electronics are frequently combined with accelerometers
(acceleration sensors) for more robust direction- and motion-sensing. Examples
of such applications include smartphones such as the Samsung_Galaxy_Note_4,[54]
HTC_Titan,[55] Nexus_5, iPhone_5s,[56] Nokia_808_PureView[57] and Sony_Xperia,
game console peripherals such as the PlayStation_3_controller and the Wii
Remote, and virtual reality sets such as the Oculus_Rift.[58]
Nintendo has integrated a gyroscope into the Wii console's Wii Remote
controller by an additional piece of hardware called "Wii_MotionPlus".[59] It
is also included in the 3DS and the Wii U GamePad, which detects movement when
turning.
Cruise ships use gyroscopes to level motion-sensitive devices such as self-
leveling pool tables.[60]
An electric powered flywheel gyroscope inserted in a bicycle wheel is being
sold as a training wheel alternative.[61]
