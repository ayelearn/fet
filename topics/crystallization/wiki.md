Crystallization is the (natural or artificial) process by which a solid forms,
where the atoms or molecules are highly organized into a structure known as a
crystal. Some of the ways by which crystals form are precipitating from a
solution, freezing, or more rarely deposition directly from a gas. Attributes
of the resulting crystal depend largely on factors such as temperature, air
pressure, and in the case of liquid crystals, time of fluid evaporation.
Crystallization occurs in two major steps. The first is nucleation, the
appearance of a crystalline phase from either a supercooled liquid or a
supersaturated solvent. The second step is known as crystal_growth, which is
the increase in the size of particles and leads to a crystal state. An
important feature of this step is that loose particles form layers at the
crystal's surface lodge themselves into open inconsistencies such as pores,
cracks, etc.
The majority of minerals and organic molecules crystallize easily, and the
resulting crystals are generally of good quality, i.e. without visible defects.
However, larger biochemical particles, like proteins, are often difficult to
crystallize. The ease with which molecules will crystallize strongly depends on
the intensity of either atomic forces (in the case of mineral substances),
intermolecular forces (organic and biochemical substances) or intramolecular
forces (biochemical substances).
Crystallization is also a chemical solidâliquid separation technique, in
which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid
crystalline phase occurs. In chemical_engineering, crystallization occurs in a
crystallizer. Crystallization is therefore related to precipitation, although
the result is not amorphous or disordered, but a crystal.

The crystallization process consists of two major events, nucleation and
crystal_growth which are driven by thermodynamic properties as well as chemical
properties. In crystallization Nucleation is the step where the solute
molecules or atoms dispersed in the solvent start to gather into clusters, on
the microscopic scale (elevating solute concentration in a small region), that
become stable under the current operating conditions. These stable clusters
constitute the nuclei. Therefore, the clusters need to reach a critical size in
order to become stable nuclei. Such critical size is dictated by many different
factors (temperature, supersaturation, etc.). It is at the stage of nucleation
that the atoms or molecules arrange in a defined and periodic manner that
defines the crystal_structure â note that "crystal structure" is a special
term that refers to the relative arrangement of the atoms or molecules, not the
macroscopic properties of the crystal (size and shape), although those are a
result of the internal crystal structure.
The crystal growth is the subsequent size increase of the nuclei that succeed
in achieving the critical cluster size. Crystal growth is a dynamic process
occurring in equilibrium where solute molecules or atoms precipitate out of
solution, and dissolve back into solution. Supersaturation is one of the
driving forces of crystallization, as the solubility of a species is an
equilibrium process quantified by Ksp. Depending upon the conditions, either
nucleation or growth may be predominant over the other, dictating crystal size.
Many compounds have the ability to crystallize with some having different
crystal structures, a phenomenon called polymorphism. Each polymorph is in fact
a different thermodynamic solid state and crystal polymorphs of the same
compound exhibit different physical properties, such as dissolution rate, shape
(angles between facets and facet growth rates), melting point, etc. For this
reason, polymorphism is of major importance in industrial manufacture of
crystalline products. Additionally, crystal phases can sometimes be
interconverted by varying factors such as temperature.
***** In nature *****
Snowflakes are a very well-known example, where subtle differences in crystal
growth conditions result in different geometries.
Crystallized honey
There are many examples of natural process that involve crystallization.
Geological_time_scale process examples include:
    * Natural (mineral) crystal formation (see also gemstone);
    * Stalactite/stalagmite, rings formation.
Human_time_scale process examples include:
    * Snow_flakes formation;
    * Honey crystallization (nearly all types of honey crystallize).
***** Methods *****
Crystal formation can be divided into two types, where the first type of
crystals are composed of a cation and anion, also known as a salt, such as
sodium_acetate. The second type of crystals are composed of uncharged species,
for example menthol.[1]
Crystal formation can be achieved by various methods, such as: cooling,
evaporation, addition of a second solvent to reduce the solubility of the
solute (technique known as antisolvent or drown-out), solvent layering,
sublimation, changing the cation or anion, as well as other methods.
The formation of a supersaturated solution does not guarantee crystal
formation, and often a seed crystal or scratching the glass is required to form
nucleation sites.
A typical laboratory technique for crystal formation is to dissolve the solid
in a solution in which it is partially soluble, usually at high temperatures to
obtain supersaturation. The hot mixture is then filtered to remove any
insoluble impurities. The filtrate is allowed to slowly cool. Crystals that
form are then filtered and washed with a solvent in which they are not soluble,
but is miscible with the mother_liquor. The process is then repeated to
increase the purity in a technique known as recrystallization.
For biological molecules in which the solvent channels continue to be present
to retain the three dimensional structure intact, microbatch[2] crystallization
under oil and vapor diffusion[3] methods have been the common methods.
**** Typical equipment ****
Equipment for the main_industrial_processes_for_crystallization.
   1. Tank crystallizers. Tank crystallization is an old method still used in
      some specialized cases. Saturated solutions, in tank crystallization, are
      allowed to cool in open tanks. After a period of time the mother liquor
      is drained and the crystals removed. Nucleation and size of crystals are
      difficult to control.[citation_needed] Typically, labor costs are very
      high.[citation_needed]
***** Thermodynamic view *****

captured, stored, and sputter-coated with platinum at cryo-temperatures for
imaging.
The crystallization process appears to violate the second_principle_of
thermodynamics. Whereas most processes that yield more orderly results are
achieved by applying heat, crystals usually form at lower
temperaturesâespecially by supercooling. However, due to the release of the
heat of fusion during crystallization, the entropy of the universe increases,
thus this principle remains unaltered.
The molecules within a pure, perfect crystal, when heated by an external
source, will become liquid. This occurs at a sharply defined temperature
(different for each type of crystal). As it liquifies, the complicated
architecture of the crystal collapses. Melting occurs because the entropy (S)
gain in the system by spatial randomization of the molecules has overcome the
enthalpy (H) loss due to breaking the crystal packing forces:
         T (  S  liquid   &#x2212;  S  solid   ) >  H  liquid   &#x2212;  H
      solid   ,   {\displaystyle T(S_{\text{liquid}}-S_{\text{solid}})>H_{\text
      {liquid}}-H_{\text{solid}},}  [{\displaystyle T(S_{\text{liquid}}-S_
      {\text{solid}})>H_{\text{liquid}}-H_{\text{solid}},}]
          G  liquid   <  G  solid   .   {\displaystyle G_{\text{liquid}}<G_
      {\text{solid}}.}  [{\displaystyle G_{\text{liquid}}<G_{\text{solid}}.}]
Regarding crystals, there are no exceptions to this rule. Similarly, when the
molten crystal is cooled, the molecules will return to their crystalline form
once the temperature falls beyond the turning point. This is because the
thermal randomization of the surroundings compensates for the loss of entropy
that results from the reordering of molecules within the system. Such liquids
that crystallize on cooling are the exception rather than the rule.
The nature of a crystallization process is governed by both thermodynamic and
kinetic factors, which can make it highly variable and difficult to control.
Factors such as impurity level, mixing regime, vessel design, and cooling
profile can have a major impact on the size, number, and shape of crystals
produced.
***** Dynamics *****
As mentioned above, a crystal is formed following a well-defined pattern, or
structure, dictated by forces acting at the molecular level. As a consequence,
during its formation process the crystal is in an environment where the solute
concentration reaches a certain critical value, before changing status. Solid
formation, impossible below the solubility threshold at the given temperature
and pressure conditions, may then take place at a concentration higher than the
theoretical solubility level. The difference between the actual value of the
solute concentration at the crystallization limit and the theoretical (static)
solubility threshold is called supersaturation and is a fundamental factor in
crystallization.
**** Nucleation ****
Main article: Nucleation
Nucleation is the initiation of a phase change in a small region, such as the
formation of a solid crystal from a liquid solution. It is a consequence of
rapid local fluctuations on a molecular scale in a homogeneous phase that is in
a state of metastable equilibrium. Total nucleation is the sum effect of two
categories of nucleation â primary and secondary.
*** Primary nucleation ***
Primary nucleation is the initial formation of a crystal where there are no
other crystals present or where, if there are crystals present in the system,
they do not have any influence on the process. This can occur in two
conditions. The first is homogeneous nucleation, which is nucleation that is
not influenced in any way by solids. These solids include the walls of the
crystallizer vessel and particles of any foreign substance. The second
category, then, is heterogeneous nucleation. This occurs when solid particles
of foreign substances cause an increase in the rate of nucleation that would
otherwise not be seen without the existence of these foreign particles.
Homogeneous nucleation rarely occurs in practice due to the high energy
necessary to begin nucleation without a solid surface to catalyse the
nucleation.
Primary nucleation (both homogeneous and heterogeneous) has been modelled with
the following:[4]
         B =     d N   d t     =  k  n   ( c &#x2212;  c  &#x2217;    )  n   ,
      {\displaystyle B={\dfrac {dN}{dt}}=k_{n}(c-c^{*})^{n},}  [{\displaystyle
      B={\dfrac {dN}{dt}}=k_{n}(c-c^{*})^{n},}]
where
      B is the number of nuclei formed per unit volume per unit time,
      N is the number of nuclei per unit volume,
      kn is a rate constant,
      c is the instantaneous solute concentration,
      c* is the solute concentration at saturation,
      (c â c*) is also known as supersaturation,
      n is an empirical exponent that can be as large as 10, but generally
      ranges between 3 and 4.
*** Secondary nucleation ***
Secondary nucleation is the formation of nuclei attributable to the influence
of the existing microscopic crystals in the magma.[5] Simply put, secondary
nucleation is when crystal growth is initiated with contact of other existing
crystals or "seeds".[6] The first type of known secondary crystallization is
attributable to fluid shear, the other due to collisions between already
existing crystals with either a solid surface of the crystallizer or with other
crystals themselves. Fluid-shear nucleation occurs when liquid travels across a
crystal at a high speed, sweeping away nuclei that would otherwise be
incorporated into a crystal, causing the swept-away nuclei to become new
crystals. Contact nucleation has been found to be the most effective and common
method for nucleation. The benefits include the following:[5]
    * Low kinetic order and rate-proportional to supersaturation, allowing easy
      control without unstable operation.
    * Occurs at low supersaturation, where growth rate is optimal for good
      quality.
    * Low necessary energy at which crystals strike avoids the breaking of
      existing crystals into new crystals.
    * The quantitative fundamentals have already been isolated and are being
      incorporated into practice.
The following model, although somewhat simplified, is often used to model
secondary nucleation:[4]
         B =     d N   d t     =  k  1    M  T   j   ( c &#x2212;  c  &#x2217;
      )  b   ,   {\displaystyle B={\dfrac {dN}{dt}}=k_{1}M_{T}^{j}(c-c^{*})^
      {b},}  [{\displaystyle B={\dfrac {dN}{dt}}=k_{1}M_{T}^{j}(c-c^{*})^{b},}]
where
      k1 is a rate constant,
      MT is the suspension density,
      j is an empirical exponent that can range up to 1.5, but is generally 1,
      b is an empirical exponent that can range up to 5, but is generally 2.
Crystal growth
**** Growth ****
Main article: Crystal_growth
Once the first small crystal, the nucleus, forms it acts as a convergence point
(if unstable due to supersaturation) for molecules of solute touching â or
adjacent to â the crystal so that it increases its own dimension in
successive layers. The pattern of growth resembles the rings of an onion, as
shown in the picture, where each colour indicates the same mass of solute; this
mass creates increasingly thin layers due to the increasing surface area of the
growing crystal. The supersaturated solute mass the original nucleus may
capture in a time unit is called the growth rate expressed in kg/(m2*h), and is
a constant specific to the process. Growth rate is influenced by several
physical factors, such as surface_tension of solution, pressure, temperature,
relative crystal velocity in the solution, Reynolds_number, and so forth.
The main values to control are therefore:
    * Supersaturation value, as an index of the quantity of solute available
      for the growth of the crystal;
    * Total crystal surface in unit fluid mass, as an index of the capability
      of the solute to fix onto the crystal;
    * Retention time, as an index of the probability of a molecule of solute to
      come into contact with an existing crystal;
    * Flow pattern, again as an index of the probability of a molecule of
      solute to come into contact with an existing crystal (higher in laminar
      flow, lower in turbulent_flow, but the reverse applies to the probability
      of contact).
The first value is a consequence of the physical characteristics of the
solution, while the others define a difference between a well- and poorly
designed crystallizer.

The appearance and size range of a crystalline product is extremely important
in crystallization. If further processing of the crystals is desired, large
crystals with uniform size are important for washing, filtering,
transportation, and storage, because large crystals are easier to filter out of
a solution than small crystals. Also, larger crystals have a smaller surface
area to volume ratio, leading to a higher purity. This higher purity is due to
less retention of mother_liquor which contains impurities, and a smaller loss
of yield when the crystals are washed to remove the mother liquor. The
theoretical crystal size distribution can be estimated as a function of
operating conditions with a fairly complicated mathematical process called
population balance theory (using population_balance_equations).
***** Main crystallization processes *****
[Kristalizacija.jpg]
Some of the important factors influencing solubility are:
    * Concentration
    * Temperature
    * Polarity
    * Ionic strength
So one may identify two main families of crystallization processes:
    * Cooling crystallization
    * Evaporative crystallization
This division is not really clear-cut, since hybrid systems exist, where
cooling is performed through evaporation, thus obtaining at the same time a
concentration of the solution.
A crystallization process often referred to in chemical_engineering is the
fractional_crystallization. This is not a different process, rather a special
application of one (or both) of the above.
**** Cooling crystallization ****
*** Application ***
Most chemical_compounds, dissolved in most solvents, show the so-called direct
solubility that is, the solubility threshold increases with temperature.
Solubility of the system Na2SO4 â H2O
So, whenever the conditions are favourable, crystal formation results from
simply cooling the solution. Here cooling is a relative term: austenite
crystals in a steel form well above 1000 Â°C. An example of this
crystallization process is the production of Glauber's_salt, a crystalline form
of sodium_sulfate. In the diagram, where equilibrium temperature is on the x-
axis and equilibrium concentration (as mass percent of solute in saturated
solution) in y-axis, it is clear that sulfate solubility quickly decreases
below 32.5 Â°C. Assuming a saturated solution at 30 Â°C, by cooling it to 0 Â°C
(note that this is possible thanks to the freezing-point_depression), the
precipitation of a mass of sulfate occurs corresponding to the change in
solubility from 29% (equilibrium value at 30 Â°C) to approximately 4.5% (at
0 Â°C) â actually a larger crystal mass is precipitated, since sulfate
entrains hydration water, and this has the side effect of increasing the final
concentration.
There are limitations in the use of cooling crystallization:
    * Many solutes precipitate in hydrate form at low temperatures: in the
      previous example this is acceptable, and even useful, but it may be
      detrimental when, for example, the mass of water of hydration to reach a
      stable hydrate crystallization form is more than the available water: a
      single block of hydrate solute will be formed â this occurs in the case
      of calcium_chloride);
    * Maximum supersaturation will take place in the coldest points. These may
      be the heat exchanger tubes which are sensitive to scaling, and heat
      exchange may be greatly reduced or discontinued;
    * A decrease in temperature usually implies an increase of the viscosity of
      a solution. Too high a viscosity may give hydraulic problems, and the
      laminar_flow thus created may affect the crystallization dynamics.
    * It is not applicable to compounds having reverse solubility, a term to
      indicate that solubility increases with temperature decrease (an example
      occurs with sodium sulfate where solubility is reversed above 32.5 Â°C).
*** Cooling crystallizers ***
Vertical cooling crystallizer in a beet sugar factory
The simplest cooling crystallizers are tanks provided with a mixer for internal
circulation, where temperature decrease is obtained by heat exchange with an
intermediate fluid circulating in a jacket. These simple machines are used in
batch processes, as in processing of pharmaceuticals and are prone to scaling.
Batch processes normally provide a relatively variable quality of product along
the batch.
The Swenson-Walker crystallizer is a model, specifically conceived by Swenson
Co. around 1920, having a semicylindric horizontal hollow trough in which a
hollow screw conveyor or some hollow discs, in which a refrigerating fluid is
circulated, plunge during rotation on a longitudinal axis. The refrigerating
fluid is sometimes also circulated in a jacket around the trough. Crystals
precipitate on the cold surfaces of the screw/discs, from which they are
removed by scrapers and settle on the bottom of the trough. The screw, if
provided, pushes the slurry towards a discharge port.
A common practice is to cool the solutions by flash evaporation: when a liquid
at a given T0 temperature is transferred in a chamber at a pressure P1 such
that the liquid saturation temperature T1 at P1 is lower than T0, the liquid
will release heat according to the temperature difference and a quantity of
solvent, whose total latent_heat of vaporization equals the difference in
enthalpy. In simple words, the liquid is cooled by evaporating a part of it.
In the sugar industry, vertical cooling crystallizers are used to exhaust the
molasses in the last crystallization stage downstream of vacuum pans, prior to
centrifugation. The massecuite enters the crystallizers at the top, and cooling
water is pumped through pipes in counterflow.
**** Evaporative crystallization ****
Another option is to obtain, at an approximately constant temperature, the
precipitation of the crystals by increasing the solute concentration above the
solubility threshold. To obtain this, the solute/solvent mass ratio is
increased using the technique of evaporation. This process is insensitive to
change in temperature (as long as hydration state remains unchanged).
All considerations on control of crystallization parameters are the same as for
the cooling models.
*** Evaporative crystallizers ***
Most industrial crystallizers are of the evaporative type, such as the very
large sodium_chloride and sucrose units, whose production accounts for more
than 50% of the total world production of crystals. The most common type is the
forced circulation (FC) model (see evaporator). A pumping device (a pump or an
axial flow mixer) keeps the crystal slurry in homogeneous suspension throughout
the tank, including the exchange surfaces; by controlling pump flow, control of
the contact time of the crystal mass with the supersaturated solution is
achieved, together with reasonable velocities at the exchange surfaces. The
Oslo, mentioned above, is a refining of the evaporative forced circulation
crystallizer, now equipped with a large crystals settling zone to increase the
retention time (usually low in the FC) and to roughly separate heavy slurry
zones from clear liquid. Evaporative crystallizers tend to yield larger average
crystal size and narrows the crystal size distribution curve.[7]
**** DTB crystallizer ****
DTB Crystallizer
Schematic of DTB
Whichever the form of the crystallizer, to achieve an effective process_control
it is important to control the retention time and the crystal mass, to obtain
the optimum conditions in terms of crystal specific surface and the fastest
possible growth. This is achieved by a separation â to put it simply â of
the crystals from the liquid mass, in order to manage the two flows in a
different way. The practical way is to perform a gravity settling to be able to
extract (and possibly recycle separately) the (almost) clear liquid, while
managing the mass flow around the crystallizer to obtain a precise slurry
density elsewhere. A typical example is the DTB (Draft Tube and Baffle)
crystallizer, an idea of Richard Chisum Bennett (a Swenson engineer and later
President of Swenson) at the end of the 1950s. The DTB crystallizer (see
images) has an internal circulator, typically an axial flow mixer â yellow
â pushing upwards in a draft tube while outside the crystallizer there is a
settling area in an annulus; in it the exhaust solution moves upwards at a very
low velocity, so that large crystals settle â and return to the main
circulation â while only the fines, below a given grain size are extracted
and eventually destroyed by increasing or decreasing temperature, thus creating
additional supersaturation. A quasi-perfect control of all parameters is
achieved as DTF crystallizers offer superior control over crystal size and
characteristics.[8] This crystallizer, and the derivative models (Krystal, CSC,
etc.) could be the ultimate solution if not for a major limitation in the
evaporative capacity, due to the limited diameter of the vapour head and the
relatively low external circulation not allowing large amounts of energy to be
supplied to the system.
