Tacheometry (/ËtÃ¦kiËÉmÉªtri/; from Greek for "quick measure") is a system
of rapid surveying, by which the horizontal and vertical positions of points on
the earth's surface relative to one another are determined without using a
chain or tape, or a separate levelling instrument. Instead of the pole formerly
employed to mark a point, a staff similar to a level_staff is used. This is
marked with heights from the base or foot, and is graduated according to the
form of tacheometer in use.
The horizontal distance is inferred from the vertical angle included between
two well-defined points on the staff and the known vertical distance between
them. Alternatively, also by readings of the staff indicated by two fixed
stadia wires in the diaphragm (reticle) of the telescope. The difference of
height is computed from the angle of depression or elevation of a fixed point
on the staff and the horizontal distance already obtained. The azimuth angle is
determined as formerly. Thus all the measurements requisite to locate a point
both vertically and horizontally with reference to the point where the
tacheometer is centred are determined by an observer at the instrument without
any assistance beyond that of a man to hold the staff.
The ordinary methods of surveying with a theodolite, chain, and levelling
instrument are fairly satisfactory when the ground is relatively clear of
obstructions and not very precipitous, but it becomes extremely cumbersome when
the ground is covered with bush, or broken up by ravines. Chain measurements
then become slow and liable to considerable error; the levelling, too, is
carried on at great disadvantage in point of speed, though without serious loss
of accuracy. These difficulties led to the introduction of tacheometry.
In western countries, tacheometry is primarily of historical interest in
surveying, as professional measurement nowadays is usually carried out using
total_stations and recorded using data collectors. Location positions are also
determined using GNSS. Traditional methods and instruments are still in use in
many areas of the world and by users who are not primarily surveyors.

***** Tacheometer[edit] *****
A tachymeter or tacheometer is a type of theodolite used for rapid measurements
and determines, electronically or electro-optically, the distance to target.
The principles of action are similar to those of rangefinders.
***** Stadia measurements[edit] *****
Other forms of tacheometry in surveying include the use of stadia_rods with
theodolites or plane-table alidades.[1] These use stadia_marks on the
instrument's reticle to measure the distance between two points on the stadia
rod (the stadia interval). This is converted to distance from the instrument to
the stadia rod by multiplying the stadia interval by the stadia interval
factor. If the stadia rod is not at the same elevation as the instrument, the
value must be corrected for the angle of elevation between the instrument and
the rod.
The formula most widely used for finding the distances is:
   d = k s + c   {\displaystyle d=ks+c}  [{\displaystyle d=ks+c}]
Here,     s   {\displaystyle s}  [s] is the stadia interval (top intercept
minus bottom intercept);     k   {\displaystyle k}  [k] and     c
{\displaystyle c}  [c] are multiplicative and additive constants. Generally,
the instrument is made so that     k = 100   {\displaystyle k=100}  [
{\displaystyle k=100}] and     c = 0   {\displaystyle c=0}  [c=0] exactly, to
simplify calculations.
***** Subtense bars[edit] *****
Wild brand subtense bar
Another device used in tacheometry is the subtense bar.[1] This is a rigid rod,
usually of a material insensitive to change in temperature such as invar, of
fixed length (typically two metres). The subtense bar is mounted on a tripod
over the station to which the distance is desired. It is brought to level and a
small telescope on the bar enables the bar to be oriented perpendicular to the
line of sight to the angle measuring station.
A theodolite is used to measure the angle between indicators on the two ends of
the subtense bar. The distance from the telescope to the subtense bar is the
height of an isosceles_triangle formed with the theodolite at the upper vertex
and the subtense bar length at its base, determined by trigonometry.
