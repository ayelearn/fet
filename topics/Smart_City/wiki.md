From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
A new bus network was implemented in Barcelona on the basis of Smart city data
analytics.
For the 2006 film, see Smart_City_(film).
A Smart city is an urban_area that uses different types of electronic Internet
of_things (IoT) sensors to collect_data and then use these data to manage
assets and resources efficiently. This includes data collected from citizens,
devices, and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage
traffic and transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste
management, crime detection,[1] information systems, schools, libraries,
hospitals, and other community services.[2][3]
The Smart city concept integrates information_and_communication_technology
(ICT), and various physical devices connected to the IoT network to optimize
the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens.[4][5]
Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both
community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city
and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and
interactivity of urban services, to reduce_costs and resource_consumption and
to increase contact between citizens and government.[6] Smart city applications
are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses.[7] A
Smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one
with a simple "transactional" relationship with its citizens.[8][9] Yet, the
term itself remains unclear to its specifics and therefore, open to many
interpretations.[10]
Major technological, economic and environmental changes have generated interest
in smart cities, including climate_change, economic_restructuring, the move to
online_retail and entertainment, ageing_populations, urban population growth
and pressures on public_finances.[11] The European Union (EU) has devoted
constant efforts to devising a strategy for achieving 'smart' urban_growth for
its metropolitan city-regions.[12][13] The EU has developed a range of
programmes under 'Europe's Digital Agenda".[14] In 2010, it highlighted its
focus on strengthening innovation and investment in ICT services for the
purpose of improving public services and quality of life.[13] Arup estimates
that the global_market for smart urban services will be $400 billion per annum
by 2020.[15] Examples of Smart city technologies and programs have been
implemented in Singapore,[16] Dubai,[17] Milton_Keynes,[18] Southampton,[19]
Amsterdam,[20] Barcelona,[21] Madrid,[22] Stockholm,[23] Copenhagen, China[24]
and New_York.[25]

***** Terminology[edit] *****
Due to the breadth of technologies that have been implemented under the Smart
city label, it is difficult to distill a precise definition of a Smart city.
Deakin and Al Wear[26] list four factors that contribute to the definition of a
Smart city:
   1. The application of a wide range of electronic and digital technologies to
      communities and cities.
   2. The use of ICT to transform life and working environments within the
      region.
   3. The embedding of such Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs)
      in government systems.
   4. The territorialisation of practices that brings ICTs and people together
      to enhance the innovation and knowledge that they offer.
Deakin defines the Smart city as one that utilises ICT to meet the demands of
the market (the citizens of the city), and that community involvement in the
process is necessary for a Smart city.[27] A Smart city would thus be a city
that not only possesses ICT technology in particular areas, but has also
implemented this technology in a manner that positively impacts the local
community.
Alternative definitions include:
    * Giffinger et al. 2007: "Regional competitiveness, transport and
      Information_and_Communication_Technologies economics, natural resources,
      human and social capital, quality of life, and participation of citizens
      in the governance of cities."[28]
    * Smart Cities Council[when?]: "A Smart city is one that has digital
      technology embedded across all city functions."[29][full_citation_needed]
    * Caragliu and Nijkamp 2009: "A city can be defined as 'smart' when
      investments in human and social capital and traditional (transport) and
      modern (ICT) communication infrastructure fuel sustainable_economic
      development and a high quality of life, with a wise management of natural
      resources, through participatory action and engagement."[30]
    * Frost_&_Sullivan 2014: "We identified eight key aspects that define a
      Smart city: smart governance, smart energy, smart building, smart
      mobility, smart infrastructure, smart technology, smart healthcare and
      smart citizen."[31]
    * Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers Smart Cities: "A Smart
      city brings together technology, government and society to enable the
      following characteristics: smart cities, a smart economy, smart mobility,
      a smart environment, smart people, smart living, smart governance."[32]
      [when?]
    * Business Dictionary: "A developed urban area that creates sustainable
      economic development and high quality of life by excelling in multiple
      key areas; economy, mobility, environment, people, living, and
      government. Excelling in these key areas can be done so through strong
      human capital, social capital, and/or ICT_infrastructure."[33][when?]
    * Indian_Government 2014: "Smart city offers sustainability in terms of
      economic activities and employment opportunities to a wide section of its
      residents, regardless of their level of education, skills or income
      levels."[34]
    * Department_for_Business,_Innovation_and_Skills, UK 2013: "The concept is
      not static, there is no absolute definition of a Smart city, no end
      point, but rather a process, or series of steps, by which cities become
      more 'liveable' and resilient and, hence, able to respond more quickly to
      new challenges."[35]
***** Characteristics[edit] *****
It has been suggested that a Smart city (also community, business_cluster,
urban_agglomeration or region) uses information_technologies to:
   1. Make more efficient use of physical infrastructure (roads, built
      environment and other physical assets) through artificial_intelligence
      and data_analytics to support a strong and healthy economic, social,
      cultural development.[36]
   2. Engage effectively with local people in local governance and decision by
      use of open_innovation processes and e-participation, improving the
      collective intelligence of the city's institutions through e-governance,
      [7] with emphasis placed on citizen participation and co-design.[37][38]
      [39]
   3. Learn, adapt and innovate and thereby respond more effectively and
      promptly to changing circumstances by improving the intelligence of the
      city.[7][40]
They evolve towards a strong integration of all dimensions of human
intelligence, collective_intelligence, and also artificial intelligence within
the city.[41][42] The intelligence of cities "resides in the increasingly
effective combination of digital telecommunication_networks (the nerves),
ubiquitously embedded_intelligence (the brains), sensors and tags (the sensory
organs), and software (the knowledge and cognitive competence)".[43]
These forms of intelligence in smart cities have been demonstrated in three
ways:
Bletchley Park often considered to be the first smart community.
   1. Orchestration intelligence:[7] Where cities establish institutions and
      community-based problem solving and collaborations, such as in Bletchley
      Park, where the Nazi Enigma cypher was decoded by a team led by Alan
      Turing. This has been referred to as the first example of a Smart city or
      an intelligent community.[44]
   2. Empowerment intelligence: Cities provide open_platforms, experimental
      facilities and Smart city infrastructure in order to cluster innovation
      in certain districts. These are seen in the Kista Science City in
      Stockholm and the Cyberport Zone in Hong Kong. Similar facilities have
      also been established in Melbourne.[45]
      Hong Kong Cyberport 1 and Cyberport 2 Buildings
      A hub has been created in Kyiv, which develops public projects.
   3. Instrumentation intelligence: Where city infrastructure is made smart
      through real-time_data collection, with analysis and predictive_modelling
      across city districts. There is much controversy surrounding this,
      particularly with regards to surveillance_issues_in_smart_cities.
      Examples of Instrumentation intelligence have been implemented in
      Amsterdam.[20] This is implemented through:[7]
         1. A common IP infrastructure that is open to researchers to develop
            applications.
         2. Wireless meters and devices transmit information at the point in
            time.
         3. A number of homes being provided with smart_energy_meters to become
            aware of energy consumption and reduce energy usage.
         4. Solar_power garbage_compactors, car_recharging_stations and energy
            saving_lamps.
Some major fields of intelligent city activation are:
Innovation economy        Urban infrastructure Governance
Innovation in industries,                      Administration services to
clusters, districts of a  Transport            the citizen
city
Knowledge workforce:      Energy / Utilities   Participatory and direct
Education and employment                       democracy
Creation of knowledge-    Protection of the    Services to the citizen:
intensive companies       environment / Safety Quality of life
According to David K. Owens, the former executive vice president of the Edison
Electric_Institute, two key elements that a Smart city must have are an
integrated communications platform and a "dynamic resilient grid." Both are
large investments.[46]
***** Frameworks[edit] *****
The creation, integration, and adoption of Smart city capabilities requires a
unique set of frameworks to realize the focus areas of opportunity and
innovation central to Smart city projects. The frameworks can be divided into 5
main dimensions which include numerous related categories of Smart city
development:[47]
**** Technology framework[edit] ****
A Smart city relies heavily on the deployment of technology. Different
combinations of technological infrastructure interact to form the array of
Smart city technologies with varying levels of interaction between human and
technological systems.[48]
    * Digital: A service oriented infrastructure is required to connect
      individuals and devices in a Smart city. These include innovation
      services and communication infrastructure. Yovanof, G. S. & Hazapis, G.
      N. define a digital city as "a connected community that combines
      broadband communications infrastructure; a flexible, service-oriented
      computing infrastructure based on open industry standards; and,
      innovative services to meet the needs of governments and their employees,
      citizens and businesses."[49]
    * Intelligent: Cognitive technologies, such as artificial_intelligence and
      machine_learning, can be trained on the data generated by connected city
      devices to identify patterns. The efficacy and impact of particular
      policy decisions can be quantified by cognitive systems studying the
      continuous interactions of humans with their urban surroundings.[4]
    * Ubiquitous: A ubiquitous city provides access to public services through
      any connected device. U-city is an extension of the digital city concept
      because of the facility in terms of accessibility to every
      infrastructure.[50]
    * Wired: The physical components of IT systems are crucial to early-stage
      Smart city development. Wired infrastructure is required to support the
      IoT and wireless technologies central to more interconnected living.[51]
      A wired city environment provides general access to continually updated
      digital and physical infrastructure. The latest in telecommunications,
      robotics, IoT, and various connected technologies can then be deployed to
      support human capital and productivity.[52] [53]
    * Hybrid: A hybrid city is the combination of a physical conurbation and a
      virtual_city related to the physical space. This relationship can be one
      of virtual design or the presence of a critical mass of virtual community
      participants in a physical urban space. Hybrid spaces can serve to
      actualize future-state projects for Smart city services and integration.
      [54]
    * Information city: The multiplicity of interactive devices in a Smart city
      generates a large quantity of data. How that information is interpreted
      and stored is critical to Smart city growth and security.[55]
**** Human framework[edit] ****
Smart city initiatives have measurable positive impacts on the quality of life
of its citizens and visitors.[56] The human framework of a Smart city - its
economy, knowledge networks, and human support systems - is an important
indicator of its success.[57]
    * Creativity: Arts and culture initiatives are common focus areas in Smart
      city planning.[58] Innovation is associated with intellectual curiosity
      and creativeness, and various projects have demonstrated that knowledge
      workers participate in a diverse mix of cultural and artistic activities.
      [59][60]
    * Learning: Since mobility is a key area of Smart city development,
      building a capable workforce through education initiatives is necessary.
      [61] A city's learning capacity includes its education system, including
      available workforce training and support, and its cultural development
      and exchange.[62]
    * Humanity: Numerous Smart city programs focus on soft infrastructure
      development, like increasing access to voluntary organizations and
      designated safe zones.[63] This focus on social and relational capital
      means diversity, inclusion, and ubiquitous access to public services is
      worked in to city planning.[53]
    * Knowledge: The development of a knowledge_economy is central to Smart
      city projects.[64] Smart cities seeking to be hubs of economic activity
      in emerging tech and service service sectors stress the value of
      innovation in city development.[53]
**** Institutional framework[edit] ****
According to Moser, M. A.,[62] since the 1990s, the Smart Communities movement
took shape as a strategy to broaden the base of users involved in IT. Members
of these Communities are people that share their interest and work in a
partnership with government and other institutional organizations to push the
use of IT to improve the quality of daily life as a consequence of different
worsening in daily actions. Eger, J. M.[65] said that a smart community makes a
conscious and agreed-upon decision to deploy technology as a catalyst to
solving its social and business needs. It is very important to understand that
this use of IT and the consequent improvement could be more demanding without
the institutional help; indeed institutional involvement is essential to the
success of smart community initiatives. Again Moser, M. A.[62] explained that
"building and planning a smart community seeks for smart growth"; smart growth
is essential for the partnership between citizen and institutional
organizations to react to worsening trends in daily issues like traffic
congestion, school overcrowding and air pollution. However, it is important to
note that technological propagation is not an end in itself, but only a means
to reinventing cities for a new economy and society. To sum up, it is possible
to assert that any Smart city initiatives necessitate the government's support
for their success.
The importance of these three different dimensions is that only a link among
them can make possible the development of a real Smart city concept. According
to the definition of Smart city given by Caragliu, A., Del Bo, C., & Nijkamp,
P.,[66] a city is smart when investments in human/social capital and IT
infrastructure fuel sustainable growth and enhance quality of life, through
participatory governance.
**** Energy framework[edit] ****
Smart cities use data and technology to create efficiencies, improve
sustainability, create economic development, and enhance quality of life
factors for people living and working in the city. It also means that the city
has a smarter energy infrastructure. More formally, a Smart city is: "â¦ An
urban area that has securely integrated technology across the information . . .
and Internet of Things (IoT) sectors to better manage a cityâs assets."[67]
A Smart city is powered by "smart connections" for various items such as street
lighting, smart_buildings, distributed_energy_resources (DER), data_analytics,
and smart transportation. Amongst these things, energy is paramount; this is
why utility companies play a key role in smart cities. Electric companies,
working partnership with city officials, technology companies and a number of
other institutions, are among the major players that helped accelerate the
growth of America's smart cities.[68]
**** Data Management framework[edit] ****
Smart cities employ a combination of data collection, processing, and
disseminating technologies in conjunction with networking and computing
technologies and data security and privacy measures encouraging the application
of innovation to promote the overall quality of life for its citizens and
covering dimensions that include: utilities, health, transportation,
entertainment and government services.[69]
***** Platforms and technologies[edit] *****
                    This article is missing information about platforms and
[Wiki_letter_w.svg] technologies. Please expand the article to include this
                    information. Further details may exist on the talk_page.
                    (May 2019)
New Internet technologies is a platform for promoting cloud-based_services, the
Internet_of_Things (IoT),[70] real-world user interfaces, use of smart_phones
[71] and smart_meters, networks_of_sensors and RFIDs, and more accurate
communication based on the semantic_web, open new ways to collective action and
collaborative problem_solving.
Online collaborative sensor data management platforms are on-line database
services that allow sensor owners to register and connect their devices to feed
data into an on-line database for storage and allow developers to connect to
the database and build their own applications based on that data.[72][73]
In London, a traffic management system known as SCOOT optimises green light
time at traffic intersections by feeding back magnetometer and inductive loop
data to a supercomputer, which can co-ordinate traffic lights across the city
to improve traffic throughout.[74]
The city of Santander in Cantabria, northern Spain, has 20,000 sensors
connecting buildings, infrastructure, transport, networks and utilities, offers
a physical space for experimentation and validation of the IoT functions, such
as interaction and management protocols, device technologies, and support
services such as discovery, identity_management and security[75] In Santander,
the sensors monitor the levels of pollution, noise, traffic and parking.
Electronic cards (known as smart_cards) are another common platform in Smart
city contexts. These cards possess a unique encrypted identifier that allows
the owner to log into a range of government provided services (or e-services)
without setting up multiple accounts. The single identifier allows governments
to aggregate data about_citizens and their preferences to improve the provision
of services and to determine common interests of groups. This technology has
been implemented in Southampton.[26]
Kyiv has a transport dispatch system. It contains GPS trackers, installed on
public transportation, as well as 6,000 video surveillance cameras which
monitor the traffic. The accrued data is used by local Traffic Management
Service and transport application developers.
***** Roadmap[edit] *****
A Smart city roadmap consists of four/three (the first is a preliminary check)
major components:[3][76]
   1. Define exactly what is the community: maybe that definition can condition
      what you are doing in the subsequent steps; it relates to geography,
      links between cities and countryside and flows of people between them;
      maybe â even â that in some Countries the definition of City/
      community that is stated does not correspond effectively to what â in
      fact â happens in real life.
   2. Study the Community: Before deciding to build a Smart city, first we need
      to know why. This can be done by determining the benefits of such an
      initiative. Study the community to know the citizens, the business's
      needs â know the citizens and the community's unique attributes, such
      as the age of the citizens, their education, hobbies, and attractions of
      the city.
   3. Develop a Smart city Policy: Develop a policy to drive the initiatives,
      where roles, responsibilities, objective, and goals, can be defined.
      Create plans and strategies on how the goals will be achieved.
   4. Engage The Citizens: This can be done by engaging the citizens through
      the use of e-government initiatives, open_data, sport events, etc.
In short, People, Processes, and Technology (PPT) are the three principles of
the success of a Smart city initiative. Cities must study their citizens and
communities, know the processes, business drivers, create policies, and
objectives to meet the citizens' needs. Then, technology can be implemented to
meet the citizens' need, in order to improve the quality of life and create
real economic opportunities.This requires a holistic customized approach that
accounts for city cultures, long-term city planning, and local regulations.
     "Whether to improve security, resiliency, sustainability, traffic
     congestion, public safety, or city services, each community may have
     different reasons for wanting to be smart. But all smart communities
     share common attributesâand they all are powered by smart
     connections and by our industry's smarter energy infrastructure. A
     smart_grid is the foundational piece in building a smart community."
     â Pat Vincent-Collawn, chairman of the Edison_Electric_Institute
     and president and CEO of PNM_Resources[77]
***** Research[edit] *****
University research labs developed prototypes for intelligent cities. IGLUS is
an action_research project led by EPFL focused on developing governance systems
for urban infrastructures. IGLUS announced a MOOC through Coursera.[78] MIT
Smart Cities Lab[79] focuses upon intelligent, sustainable_buildings, mobility
systems (GreenWheel electric_bicycle, mobility_on_demand, CityCar, Wheel
Robots); the IntelCities[80] research consortium for electronic government,
planning systems and citizen participation; URENIO developed intelligent city
platforms for the innovation_economy[81] focusing on strategic intelligence,
technology_transfer, collaborative innovation, and incubation, while it
promotes intelligent cities research and planning;[82] the Smart Cities
Academic Network[83] is working on e-governance and e-services in the North Sea
region. The MK:Smart project[18] is focusing on issues of sustainable energy
use, water_use and transport_infrastructure alongside exploring how to promote
citizen engagement[84] alongside educating citizens about smart cities.[85][86]
Research journals in this area include the UK IET Smart Cities, which was
launched in 2018.[87]
***** Commercialisation[edit] *****
Large IT, telecommunication and energy management companies such as Huawei,
Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Cisco, Google, Schneider_Electric, IBM and Microsoft
market initiatives for intelligent cities. Cisco, launched the Global
Intelligent Urbanization initiative[88] to help cities using the network as the
fourth utility for integrated city management, better quality_of_life for
citizens, and economic development. IBM announced its SmarterCities[89] to
stimulate economic_growth and quality of life in cities and metropolitan areas
with the activation of new approaches of thinking and acting in the urban
ecosystem. Sensor developers and startup companies are continually developing
new Smart city applications.
***** Smart cities[edit] *****
See also: ASEAN_Smart_Cities_Network_(ASCN)
Major strategies and achievements related to the spatial intelligence of cities
are listed in the Intelligent_Community_Forum awards from 1999 to 2010, in the
cities of Songdo and Suwon (South Korea), Stockholm (Sweden), Gangnam_District
of Seoul (South Korea), Waterloo,_Ontario (Canada), Taipei (Republic of China),
Mitaka (Japan), Glasgow (Scotland, UK), Calgary (Alberta, Canada), Seoul (South
Korea), New_York_City (US), LaGrange,_Georgia (US), and Singapore, which were
recognized for their efforts in developing broadband networks and e-services
sustaining innovation ecosystems, growth, and inclusion.[90] There are a number
of cities actively pursuing a Smart city strategy:
**** Amsterdam[edit] ****
Street lamps in Amsterdam have been upgraded to allow municipal councils to dim
the lights based on pedestrian usage.[91]
The Amsterdam Smart city initiative[20] which began in 2009 currently includes
170+ projects collaboratively developed by local residents, government and
businesses.[27] These projects run on an interconnected platform through
wireless_devices to enhance the city's real-time decision making abilities. The
City of Amsterdam (City) claims the purpose of the projects is to reduce
traffic, save_energy and improve public_safety.[92] To promote efforts from
local residents, the City runs the Amsterdam Smart city Challenge annually,
accepting proposals for applications and developments that fit within the
City's framework.[93] An example of a resident developed app is Mobypark, which
allows owners of parking spaces to rent them out to people for a fee.[94] The
data generated from this app can then be used by the City to determine parking
demand and traffic flows in Amsterdam. A number of homes have also been
provided with smart energy meters, with incentives provided to those that
actively reduce energy consumption.[7][95] Other initiatives include flexible
street_lighting (smart_lighting)[96] which allows municipalities to control the
brightness of street lights, and smart traffic management[97] where traffic is
monitored in real time by the City and information about current travel time on
certain roads is broadcast to allow motorists to determine the best routes to
take.
**** Barcelona[edit] ****
Barcelona has established a number of projects that can be considered 'Smart
city' applications within its "CityOS" strategy.[98] For example, sensor
technology has been implemented in the irrigation system in Parc del Centre de
Poblenou, where real time data is transmitted to gardening crews about the
level of water required for the plants.[21][99] Barcelona has also designed a
new bus network based on data analysis of the most common traffic flows in
Barcelona, utilising primarily vertical, horizontal and diagonal routes with a
number of interchanges.[100] Integration of multiple Smart city technologies
can be seen through the implementation of smart traffic lights[101] as buses
run on routes designed to optimise the number of green lights. In addition,
where an emergency is reported in Barcelona, the approximate route of the
emergency vehicle is entered into the traffic light system, setting all the
lights to green as the vehicle approaches through a mix of GPS and traffic
management software, allowing emergency services to reach the incident without
delay. Much of this data is managed by the Sentilo_Platform.[102][103]
**** Columbus, Ohio[edit] ****
 Wikimedia Commons has media related to Smart_Columbus_Experience_Center.
In the summer of 2017, the City_of_Columbus, Ohio began its pursuit of a Smart
city initiative. It partnered with American_Electric_Power_Ohio to create a
group of new electric_vehicle_charging_stations. Many smart cities such as
Columbus are using agreements such as this one to prepare for climate change,
expand electric infrastructure, convert existing public vehicle fleets to
electric cars, and create incentives for people to share_rides_when_commuting.
For doing this, the U.S._Department_of_Transportation gave the City of Columbus
a $40 million grant. The city also received $10 million from Vulcan_Inc.[104]
One key reason why the utility was involved in the picking of locations for new
electric vehicle charging stations was to gather data. According to Daily
Energy Insider, the group Infrastructure and Business Continuity for AEP said,
"You don't want to put infrastructure where it won't be used or maintained. The
data we collect will help us build a much bigger market in the future."[104]
Because autonomous vehicles are currently seeing "an increased industrial
research and legislative push globally", building routes and connections for
them is another important part of the Columbus Smart city initiative.[104]
**** Copenhagen[edit] ****
In 2014, Copenhagen claimed the prestigious World Smart Cities Award for its
âConnecting Copenhagenâ Smart city development strategy.[105] Positioned in
the Technical and Environmental Administration of Copenhagen, the Smart city
initiatives are coordinated by Copenhagen_Solutions_Lab, the cityâs
administrative unit for Smart city development. There are other notable actors
in Greater Copenhagen that coordinate and initiate Smart city initiatives
including State_of_Green and Gate21, the latter of which has initiated the
innovation hub Smart_city_Cluster_Denmark.  
In an article with The Economist[106], a current major Smart city project is
explained: âIn Copenhagen, as in many cities around the world, air_quality is
high on the agenda when it comes to liveability, with 68 percent of citizens
citing it as of high importance when it comes to what makes their city
attractive. To monitor pollution levels, Copenhagen Solutions Lab is currently
working with Google and has installed monitoring equipment in their streetview
car in order to produce a heatmap of air quality around the city. The
information will help cyclists and joggers plan routes with the best air
quality. The project also gives a glimpse of the future, when this kind of
information could be collected in real time by sensors all over the city and
collated with traffic flow data.â
In another article with The World Economic Forum, Marius Sylvestersen, Program
Director at Copenhagen Solutions Lab, explains that public-private
collaborations must be built on transparency, the willingness to share data and
must be driven by the same set of values. This requires a particularly open
mindset from the organisations that wish to get involved. To facilitate open
collaboration and knowledge-sharing, Copenhagen Solutions Lab launched the
Copenhagen Street Lab in 2016. Here, organisations such as TDC, Citelum and
Cisco work in collaboration with Copenhagen Solutions Lab to identify new
solutions to city and citizen problems.
**** Dubai[edit] ****
In 2013, the Smart Dubai project was initiated by Shaikh Mohammad_bin_Rashid_Al
Maktoum, vice president of UAE, which contained more than 100 initiatives to
make Dubai a Smart city by 2030. The project aimed to integrate private and
public sectors, enabling citizens to access these sectors through their
smartphones. Some initiatives include the Dubai Autonomous Transportation
Strategy to create driverless transits, fully digitizing government, business
and customer information and transactions, and providing citizens 5000 hotspots
to access government applications by 2021.[107][108] Two mobile applications,
mPay and DubaiNow, facilitate various payment services for citizens ranging
from utilities or traffic fines to educational, health, transport, and business
services. In addition, the Smart Nol_Card is a unified rechargeable card
enabling citizens to pay for all transportation services such as metro, buses,
water bus, and taxis. There is also the Dubai_Municipality's Digital City
initiative which assigns each building a unique QR code that citizens can scan
containing information about the building, plot, and location.[109]
**** Dublin[edit] ****
Dublin finds itself as an unexpected capital for smart cities.[110] The Smart
city programme for the city is run by Smart Dublin[111] an initiative of the
four Dublin Local Authorities to engage with smart technology providers,
researchers and citizens to solve city challenges and improve city life. It
includes Dublinked- Dublin's open data platform that hosts open source data to
Smart city applications.
**** Madrid[edit] ****
Madrid, Spain's pioneering Smart city,[112] has adopted the MiNT Madrid
Inteligente/Smarter Madrid platform to integrate the management of local
services. These include the sustainable and computerized management of
infrastructure, garbage collection and recycling, and public spaces and green
areas, among others.[113] The programme is run in partnership with IBMs INSA,
making use of the latter's Big Data and analytics capabilities and experience.
[114] Madrid is considered to have taken a bottom-up approach to smart cities,
whereby social issues are first identified and individual technologies or
networks are then identified to address these issues.[115] This approach
includes support and recognition for start ups through the Madrid Digital Start
Up programme.[116]
**** Malta[edit] ****
A document written in 2011 refers to 18th century Å»ejtun as the earliest
"Smart city" in Malta,[117] but not in the modern context of a Smart city. By
the 21st century, SmartCity_Malta, a planned technology park, became partially
operational while the rest is under construction, as a Foreign_Direct
Investment.
**** Manchester[edit] ****
In December 2015, Manchester's CityVerve project was chosen as the winner of a
government-led technology competition and awarded Â£10m to develop an Internet
of_Things (IoT) smart cities demonstrator.[118]
Established in July 2016, the project is being carried out by a consortium of
22 public and private organisations, including Manchester_City_Council, and is
aligned with the city's on-going devolution commitment.[119]
The project has a two-year remit to demonstrate the capability of IoT
applications and address barriers to deploying smart cities, such as city
governance, network security, user trust and adoption, interoperability,
scalability and justifying investment.
CityVerve is based on an open data principle that incorporates a "platform of
platforms"[120] which ties together applications for its four key themes:
transport and travel; health and social care; energy and the environment;
culture and the public realm. This will also ensure that the project is
scalable and able to be redeployed to other locations worldwide.
**** Milan[edit] ****
Milan, Italy was prompted to begin its Smart city strategies and initiatives by
the European Union's Smart Cities and Communities initiative. However, unlike
many European cities, Milan's Smart city strategies focus more on social
sustainability rather than environmental sustainability.[121] This focus is
almost exclusive to Milan and has a major influence in the way content and way
its strategies are implemented as shown in the case study of the Bicocca
District in Milan.[122]
**** Milton Keynes[edit] ****
Milton_Keynes has a commitment to making itself a Smart city. Currently the
mechanism through which this is approached is the MK:Smart initiative,[18] a
collaboration of local government, businesses, academia and 3rd sector
organisations. The focus of the initiative is on making energy use, water use
and transport more sustainable whilst promoting economic_growth in the city.
Central to the project is the creation of a state-of-the-art 'MK Data_Hub'
which will support the acquisition and management of vast amounts of data
relevant to city systems from a variety of data sources. These will include
data about energy and water_consumption, transport data, data acquired through
satellite technology, social and economic datasets, and crowdsourced data from
social_media or specialised apps.
The MK:Smart initiative has two aspects which extend our understanding of how
Smart Cities should operate. The first, Our MK,[84] is a scheme for promoting
citizen-led sustainability issues in the city. The scheme provides funding and
support to engage with citizens and help turn their ideas around sustainability
into a reality. The second aspect is in providing citizens with the skills to
operate effectively in a Smart city. The Urban Data school[85] is an online
platform to teach school students about data skills while the project has also
produced a MOOC[86] to inform citizens about what a Smart city is.
**** New Songdo City[edit] ****
Further information: Songdo_International_Business_District
[123][124]
**** New York City[edit] ****
New_York_City is developing a number of Smart city initiatives. A notable
example is the series of city service kiosks in the LinkNYC network. These
provide services including free WiFi, phone calls, device charging stations,
local wayfinding, and more, funded by advertising that plays on the kiosk's
screens[citation_needed]
**** San Leandro[edit] ****
The city of San_Leandro, California is in the midst of transforming from an
industrial center to a tech hub of the Internet_of_things (IoT) (technology
that lets devices communicate with each other over the Internet). California's
utility company PG&E is working with the city in this endeavor and on a smart
energy pilot program that would develop a distributed energy network across the
city that would be monitored by IoT sensors. The goal would be to give the city
an energy system that has enough capacity to receive and redistribute
electricity to and from multiple energy sources.[67]
**** Santa Cruz[edit] ****
An alternative use of Smart city technology can be found in Santa_Cruz,
California, where local authorities analyse historical crime data in order to
predict_police_requirements and maximise police presence where it is required.
[125] The analytical tools generate a list of 10 places each day where property
crimes are more likely to occur, and then placing police efforts on these
regions when officers are not responding to any emergency. This use of ICT
technology is different to the manner in which European cities utilise Smart
city technology, possibly highlighting the breadth of the Smart city concept in
different parts of the world.
**** Shanghai[edit] ****
Shanghai's development of the IoT and internet connection speeds have allowed
for third party companies to revolutionize the productivity of the city.[126]
As mobile ride share giant, DiDi_Chuxing, continuously adds more user
protection features such as ride recording, and a new quick response safety
center, Shanghai is furthering their Smart city agenda.[127] During the first
China_International_Import_Expo, Shanghai focused on smart mobility and
implemented sensors to accept smartphone traffic cards in all metro stations
and buses to increase efficiency in the city.
**** Smart cities in India[edit] ****
Main article: Smart_Cities_Mission
It is a retrofitting and urban renewal program being spearheaded by the
Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. The Government of India has
the ambitious vision of developing 100 cities by modernizing existing mid-sized
cities.[128]
**** Smart Nation Singapore[edit] ****
Main article: Smart_Nation
Despite its size and lack of natural resources, Singapore (a city-state) has
overcome many of its challenges in 50 short years to become one of the world's
most advanced and livable countries. It has embarked on its next phase of
transformation towards a Smart Nation, and endeavours to harness the power of
networks, data and info-comm technologies to improve living, create economic
opportunities and build closer communities.
**** Stockholm[edit] ****
The Kista Science City from above.
Stockholm's Smart city technology is underpinned by the Stokab_dark_fibre
system[129] which was developed in 1994 to provide a universal fibre optic
network across Stockholm.[130] Private companies are able to lease fibre as
service providers on equal terms. The company is owned by the City of Stockholm
itself.[23] Within this framework, Stockholm has created a Green IT strategy.
[131] The Green IT program seeks to reduce the environmental impact of
Stockholm through IT functions such as energy efficient buildings (minimising
heating costs), traffic monitoring (minimising the time spent on the road) and
development of e-services (minimising paper usage). The e-Stockholm platform is
centred on the provision of e-services, including political announcements,
parking space booking and snow clearance.[132] This is further being developed
through GPS analytics, allowing residents to plan their route through the city.
[132] An example of district-specific Smart city technology can be found in the
Kista Science City region.[133] This region is based on the triple helix
concept of smart cities,[36] where university, industry and government work
together to develop ICT applications for implementation in a Smart city
strategy.
**** Taipei[edit] ****
Taipei start Smarttaipei project since 3/20/2016, the major concept of
Smarttaipei is to change the culture[134] of city hall government to be able to
adopt new ideas and new concepts call bottom-up mechanism, and the Taipei Smart
city Project management office(TPMO) play a key role of this project. TPMO
accept proposals from industry and help to negotiate with relative department
of Taipei city to initiate new proof of concept(PoC) project, there are more
than 150[135] PoC Project established, and only 34% project finished. Dr. Chen-
Yu_Lee[136], director of TPMO, is the major planner/executor of this project.
**** Kyiv[edit] ****
â³Kyiv Smart cityâ³ initiative has been established to create favorable
conditions for further development and increased public involvement in city
management. Such an approach lays the fundamental principles of
infrastructural, technological and social development of Kyiv, and defines the
future transformation of the city area. There are several public projects,
based on digital technologies, in Kyiv. For example, there is â³Kyiv Resident
Cardâ³, which provides access to local innovations and serves as an e-ticket
for all types of public transportation. Ultimately, the â³Smart cityâ³
concept implies the possibility of managing municipal services online.
***** Criticism[edit] *****
See also: Surveillance_issues_in_smart_cities
The criticisms of smart cities revolve around:[36]
    * A bias in strategic interest may lead to ignoring alternative avenues of
      promising urban development.[137]
    * A Smart city, as a scientifically planned city, would defy the fact that
      real development in cities is often haphazard. In that line of criticism,
      the Smart city is seen as unattractive for citizens as they "can deaden
      and stupefy the people who live in its all-efficient embrace".[138]
      Instead, people would prefer cities they can participate to shape.
    * The focus of the concept of Smart city may lead to an underestimation of
      the possible negative effects of the development of the new technological
      and networked infrastructures needed for a city to be smart.[139]
    * As a globalized business_model is based on capital_mobility, following a
      business-oriented model may result in a losing long term strategy: "The
      'spatial fix' inevitably means that mobile capital can often 'write its
      own deals' to come to town, only to move on when it receives a better
      deal elsewhere. This is no less true for the Smart city than it was for
      the industrial, [or] manufacturing city."[36]
    * The high level of big_data collection and analytics has raised questions
      regarding surveillance_in_smart_cities, particularly as it relates to
      predictive_policing.
    * As of August 2018, the discussion on smart cities centres around the
      usage and implementation of technology rather than on the inhabitants of
      the cities and how they can be involved in the process.[140]
    * Especially in low-income countries, smart cities are irrelevant to the
      majority of the urban population, which lives in poverty with limited
      access to basic services. A focus on smart cities may worsen inequality
      and marginalization.[141]
    * If a Smart city strategy is not planned taking into account people with
      accessibility problems, such as persons with disabilities affecting
      mobility, vision, hearing, and cognitive function, the implementation of
      new technologies could create new barriers.[142]
