Threading is the process of creating a screw_thread. More screw threads are
produced each year than any other machine_element.[1] There are many methods of
generating threads, including subtractive methods (many kinds of thread cutting
and grinding, as detailed below); deformative or transformative methods
(rolling and forming; molding and casting); additive methods (such as 3D
printing); or combinations thereof.

***** Overview of methods (comparison, selection, etc.)[edit] *****
There are various methods for generating screw threads. The method chosen for
any one application is chosen based on constraintsâtime, money, degree of
precision needed (or not needed), what equipment is already available, what
equipment purchases could be justified based on resulting unit price of the
threaded part (which depends on how many parts are planned), etc.
In general, certain thread-generating processes tend to fall along certain
portions of the spectrum from toolroom-made parts to mass-produced parts,
although there can be considerable overlap. For example, thread lapping
following thread grinding would fall only on the extreme toolroom end of the
spectrum, while thread rolling is a large and diverse area of practice that is
used for everything from microlathe leadscrews (somewhat pricey and very
precise) to the cheapest deck screws (very affordable and with precision to
spare).
Threads of metal fasteners are usually created on a thread rolling machine.
They may also be cut with a lathe, tap_or_die. Rolled threads are stronger than
cut threads, with increases of 10% to 20% in tensile strength and possibly more
in fatigue resistance and wear resistance.[2][3]
***** Subtractive methods[edit] *****
**** Thread cutting[edit] ****
Thread cutting, as compared to thread forming and rolling, is used when full
thread depth is required, when the quantity is small, when the blank is not
very accurate, when threading up to a shoulder is required, when threading a
tapered thread, or when the material is brittle.[4]
*** Taps and dies[edit] ***
Main articles: Tap_and_die and Die_head
A common method of threading is cutting with taps and dies. Unlike drill_bits,
hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot
cut its threads in a single rotation because it creates long chips which
quickly jam the tap (an effect known as "crowding"[citation_needed]), possibly
breaking it. Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is to cut
the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the
tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back
edges of the cutters. It may be necessary to periodically remove the tap from
the hole to clear the chips, especially when a blind_hole is threaded.
For continuous tapping operations (i.e., power tapping) specialized spiral
point or "gun" taps are used to eject the chips and prevent crowding.
*** Single-point threading[edit] ***
Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just
thread cutting when the context is implicit), is an operation that uses a
single-point_tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool
moves linearly while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines the lead
of the thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads
(male or female). In external thread cutting, the piece can either be held in a
chuck or mounted between two centers. With internal thread cutting, the piece
is held in a chuck. The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off
the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct
depth of the thread.[5]
The coordination of various machine elements including leadscrew, slide rest,
and change gears was the technological advance that allowed the invention of
the screw-cutting_lathe, which was the origin of single-point threading as we
know it today.
Today engine_lathes and CNC lathes are the commonly used machines for single-
point threading. On CNC machines, the process is quick and easy (relative to
manual control) due to the machine's ability to constantly track the
relationship of the tool position and spindle position (called "spindle
synchronization"). CNC software includes "canned cycles", that is,
preprogrammed subroutines, that obviate the manual programming of a single-
point threading cycle.[6] Parameters are entered (e.g., thread size, tool
offset, length of thread), and the machine does the rest.
All threading could feasibly be done using a single-point tool, but because of
the high speed and thus low unit cost of other methods (e.g., tapping, die
threading, and thread rolling and forming), single-point threading is usually
only used when other factors of the manufacturing process happen to favor it
(e.g., if only a few threads need to be made,[7] if an unusual or unique thread
is required,[7] or if there is a need for very high concentricity with other
part features machined during the same setup.[8])
*** Thread milling[edit] ***

The path a multiple-form thread cutting tool travels to create an external
thread.
Threads may be milled with a rotating milling_cutter if the correct helical
toolpath can be arranged. This was formerly arranged mechanically, and it was
suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the
widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more
common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work
where they would formerly have been cut with taps, die heads, or single-
pointing. Some advantages of thread milling, as compared to single-point
cutting or taps and dies, are faster cycle times, less tool breakage, and that
a left- or right-hand thread can be created with the same tool.[9]
Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire_hydrant casting),
it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all
needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed
to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is,
for the "arms" and "mouth" of the hydrant).
There are various types of thread milling, including several variants of form-
milling and a combination of drilling and threading with one cutter, called
thrilling.
Form-milling uses either a single- or multiple-form cutter. In one variant of
form-milling, the single-form cutter is tilted to the helix_angle of the thread
and then fed radially into the blank. The blank is then slowly rotated as the
cutter is precisely moved along the axis of the blank, which cuts the thread
into the blank. This can be done in one pass, if the cutter is fed to the full
thread depth, or in two passes, with the first not being to the full thread
depth. This process is mainly used on threads larger than 1.5 in (38 mm). It is
commonly used to cut large-lead or multiple-lead threads. A similar variant
using a multiple-form cutter exists, in which the process completes the thread
in one revolution around the blank. The cutter must be longer than the desired
thread length. Using a multiple-form cutter is faster than using a single-form
cutter but it is limited to threads with a helix angle less than 3Â°. It is
also limited to blanks of a substantial diameter and no longer than 2 in
(51 mm).[10]
Another variant of form-milling involves holding the cutter's axis orthogonally
(no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath
that will generate the thread.[11] The part is usually a stationary workpiece,
such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a
plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses
essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill,
but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the "contour"
of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which
is circular interpolation in one plane [typically XY] with simultaneous linear
interpolation along a third axis [typically Z]; the CNC control model must be
one that supports using the third axis)[11] or a simulation of it using
extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not
practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM
software).[12] The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead;
the lead (thread helix angle) is determined by the toolpath.[13] Tapered
threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes
the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation,[14] or with a
straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one
or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM
software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.[14]
The tooling used for thread milling can be solid or indexable. For internal
threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than 6 mm
(0.24 in),[13] and indexable internal thread cutting tools are limited to holes
larger than 12 mm (0.47 in). The advantage is that when the insert wears out it
is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle
time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form thread
cutting tools look similar to taps, but they differ in that the cutting tool
does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in chamfer. This lack of a
lead-in chamfer allows the threads to be formed within one pitch length of the
bottom of a blind hole.[15]
** Thrilling[edit] **
Thrilling is the process of threading and drilling (accomplished in the reverse
order) internal threads using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The
cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting endmill, while the
body has a thread-shaped form with a countersink_cutter form near the shank.
The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly
interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. This tool
drills, chamfers, and threads a hole all in one compact cycle.[16] The
advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The
disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three
times the diameter of the tool.[17]
*** Helical broaching (Punch Tap)[edit] ***
A method of helical broaching was developed in the 2010s that shortens the
toolpath of tapping. To a casual observer (without slow_motion), it looks
rather similar to traditional tapping but with faster movement into and out of
the hole. It uses a specific tool geometry and toolpath to position rapidly,
broach the thread in a single half-turn, and then retract rapidly, shortening
the cycle time and consuming less energy.[18] It reduces the cost of threading
for any holes that can safely allow the two small fast-helix grooves that it
leaves behind along with the thread, which could be true in many applications.
**** Thread grinding[edit] ****
Thread grinding is done on a grinding_machine using specially dressed grinding
wheels matching the shape of the threads. The process is usually used to
produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is
ball screw mechanisms.[citation_needed] There are three types: center-type
grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless
thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of
the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point
cutting_tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel.
Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also
available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required.
Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that
is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is
fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated
through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per
revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make
head-less set_screws in a similar method as centerless_grinding. The blanks are
hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common
centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for
a 0.5 in (13 mm) long set screw.[17]
**** Thread lapping[edit] ****
Rarely, thread cutting or grinding (usually the latter) will be followed by
thread lapping in order to achieve the highest precision and surface finish
achievable. This is a toolroom practice when the highest precision is required,
rarely employed except for the leadscrews or ballscrews of high-end machine
tools.
**** Threading with EDM[edit] ****
Internal threads can be electrical_discharge_machined (EDM) into hard materials
using a sinker style machine.
***** Deformative or transformative methods[edit] *****
**** Thread forming and rolling[edit] ****
The thread forming and rolling concept
Page 23 of Colvin FH, Stanley FA (eds) (1914): American Machinists' Handbook,
2nd ed. New York and London: McGraw-Hill. Summarizes screw thread rolling
practice as of 1914.
Thread forming and thread rolling are processes for forming screw threads, with
the former referring to creating internal threads and the latter external
threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing
a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a
process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs
because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and
rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size
starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a
15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight.[17] A rolled thread can be
easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because
the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been
made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with
threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a
reduced shank in the region to be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter
from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled
fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final
threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.[3]
Materials are limited to ductile materials because the threads are cold_formed.
However, this increases the thread's yield strength, surface finish, hardness,
and wear_resistance.[17] Also, materials with good deformation characteristics
are necessary for rolling; these materials include softer (more ductile) metals
and exclude brittle materials, such as cast_iron. Tolerances are typically
Â±0.001 in. (Â±0.025 mm), but tolerances as tight as Â±0.0006 in (Â±0.015 mm)
are achievable. Surface finishes range from 6 to 32 micro-inches.[19]
There are four main types of thread rolling, named after the configuration of
the dies: flat dies, two-die cylindrical, three-die cylindrical, and planetary
dies. The flat die system has two flat dies. The bottom one is held stationary
and the other slides. The blank is placed on one end of the stationary die and
then the moving die slides over the blank, which causes the blank to roll
between the two dies forming the threads. Before the moving die reaches the end
of its stroke the blank rolls off the stationary die in a finished form. The
two-die cylindrical process is used to produce threads up to 6 in (150 mm) in
diameter and 20 in (510 mm) in length. There are two types of three-die
processes; the first has the three dies move radially out from the center to
let the blank enter the dies and then closes and rotates to roll the threads.
This type of process is commonly employed on turret_lathes and screw_machines.
The second type takes the form of a self-opening die_head. This type is more
common than the former, but is limited by not being able form the last 1.5 to 2
threads against shoulders. Planetary dies are used to mass-produce threads up
to 1 in (25 mm) in diameter.[4][17]
Thread forming is performed using a fluteless tap, or roll tap,[20] which
closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes. There are lobes
periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the
tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce
chips, there is no need to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips,
which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is
particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a
cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size
differs from that used for a cutting tap and that an accurate hole size is
required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper
lubrication is essential because of the frictional_forces involved, therefore a
lubricating oil is used instead of cutting_oil.[2][4]
When considering the blank diameter tolerance, a change in blank diameter will
affect the major diameter by an approximate ratio of 3 to 1. Production rates
are usually three to five times faster than thread cutting.[citation_needed]

**** Thread casting and molding[edit] ****
In casting and molding the threads are directly formed by the geometry of the
mold cavity in the mold or die. When the material freezes in the mold, it
retains the shape after the mold is removed. The material is heated to a
liquid, or mixed with a liquid that will either dry or cure (such as plaster or
cement). Alternately, the material may be forced into a mold as a powder and
compressed into a solid, as with graphite.
Although the first thoughts that come to mind for most machinists regarding
threading are of thread cutting processes (such as tapping, single-pointing, or
helical milling), Smid points out that, when plastic bottles for food,
beverages, personal care products, and other consumer products are considered,
it is actually plastic molding that is the principal method (by sheer volume)
of thread generation in manufacturing today.[21] Of course, this fact
highlights the importance of the moldmakers getting the mold just right (in
preparation for millions of cycles, usually at high speed).
Cast threads in metal parts may be finished by machining, or may be left in the
as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to
bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the
application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not
strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost.
With sand_casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded
plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from
the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop)
bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable_glands (connectors/
fittings).
***** Additive methods[edit] *****
Many, perhaps most, threaded parts have potential to be generated via additive
manufacturing (3D_printing), of which there are many variants, including fused
deposition_modeling, selective_laser_sintering, direct_metal_laser_sintering,
selective_laser_melting, electron_beam_melting, layered_object_manufacturing,
and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long
since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but
further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods
tend to produce a rough surface_finish and tend to be restricted in the
material_properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial
victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable.
However, the capabilities are continually growing.
Good examples of threaded parts produced with additive manufacturing are found
in the dental_implant and bone_screw fields, where selective_laser_sintering
and selective_laser_melting have produced threaded titanium implants.
***** Combinations of subtractive, additive, deformative, or transformative
methods[edit] *****
Often subtractive, additive, deformative, or transformative methods are
combined in whatever ways are advantageous. Such multidisciplinary
manufacturing falls under classifications including rapid_prototyping, desktop
manufacturing, direct_manufacturing, direct_digital_manufacturing, digital
fabrication, instant_manufacturing, or on-demand_manufacturing.
***** Inspection[edit] *****
Inspection of the finished screw threads can be achieved in various ways, with
the expense of the method tailored to the requirements of the product
application. Shop-floor inspection of a thread is often as simple as running a
nut onto it (for male threads) or a bolt into it (for female threads). This is
plenty good enough for many applications (e.g., MRO or hobbyist work), although
it is not good enough for most commercial manufacturing. Higher-precision
methods are discussed below.
Commercial-grade inspection of screw threads can involve most of the same
inspection methods and tools used to inspect other manufactured products, such
as micrometers; vernier_or_dial_calipers; surface_plates and height_gauges;
gauge_blocks; optical_comparators; white_light_scanners; and coordinate-
measuring_machines (CMMs). Even industrial_radiography (including industrial_CT
scanning) can be used, for example, to inspect internal thread geometry in the
way that an optical comparator can inspect external thread geometry.
Conical micrometer anvils, specifically suited to resting on the sides of the
thread, are made for various thread_angles, with 60Â° being the most common.
Mics with such anvils are usually called "thread mics" or "pitch mics" (because
they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely
instead on the "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire
(or gauge_pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then
measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion_factor
(produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied
with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch_diameter.
Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all
standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then
perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire
method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific
diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-
start or when the thread angle is not 60Â°. Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can
be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to
use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point)
as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-
232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality
assurance and quality_control can be achieved using statistical_process
control.

**** Cold-rolling[edit] ****
The first patent for the cold rolling of screw threads was issued in 1836 to
William Keane of Monroe, N.Y.[22][23] However, the dies for rolling the threads
onto the screw blanks were made of cast iron, which is brittle, so the machine
was not successful. The process languished until 1867, when Harvey J. Harwood
of Utica, New York filed a patent for the cold-rolling of threads on wood
screws.[24] Further efforts to cold-roll threads on screws followed,[25] but
none seemed to meet with much success until Hayward Augustus Harvey (1824-1893)
of Orange, N.J. filed his patents of 1880 and 1881.[26] Charles D. Rogers of
the American Screw Co. of Providence, Rhode Island made further refinements to
the process of rolling threads onto screws.[27]

          o William Keane, "Improvement_in_machines_for_cutting_wood-_and_other
            screws," U.S. Patent no. 9,398X (issued: Feb. 13, 1836).
          o The screw "cutting" machine of William Keane and his partner,
            Thaddeus Sellick of Haverstraw, N.Y., is mentioned in the North
            River Times (Haverstraw, New York), reprinted in: The Pittsburgh
            Gazette, March 19, 1836, page_2. From page 2: "Important Invention.
            Mr. William Keane.of Haverstraw, has in conjunction with Mr.
            Thaddeus Selleck, obtained letters patent for a machine for cutting
            screws, which probably excels any thing of the kind now in use in
            Europe or America. The principle of the machine consists in
            circular dies, which have a motion towards each other, while, at
            the same time, they make upwards of 500 revolutions a minute. These
            dies receive the screw at the top of a cast iron pot in which they
            are secured, and when it obtains its proper thread, it is thrown
            off by means of an inner spindle, and another instantly takes its
            place, the dies preserving their usual velocity, without changing
            their rotary motion. The saving of screws is another important
            consideration in favor of these machines, as it is difficult to
            spoil one upon them. Their construction is simple, and we
            understand that one, containing four sets of dies, and upon which a
            boy can turn off thirty gross per day, can be built at a cost not
            exceeding $150. They are now in operation at Selleck & Keane's
            Screw Factory, at Samsondale, in this town [i.e. Haverstraw,
            N.Y.]."
  24. ^ For a brief review of the history of screw making, see:
          o Charles D. Rogers (July 11, 1901) "Development_of_the_wood_screw,"
            The Iron Trade Review, 34 (28) : 20-21.
          o Christopher White (ca. 2005) "Observations_on_the_development_of
            wood_screws_in_North_America" (Museum of Fine Art ; Boston,
            Massachusetts).
  25. ^ Harvey J. Harwood, "Improved_screw_machine," U.S. Patent no. 65,567
      (issued: June 11, 1867). In his patent, Harwood states:
      "In the manufacture of wood-screws the thread has been formed hitherto by
      removing the metal between the turns of the thread by means of dies or
      cutters.
      By my invention the blank is rotated between rotating or reciprocating
      dies, suitably formed, and set in motion, by means of which the thread is
      impressed on the blank without removing any part of the metal."
      Apparently Harwood and the patent examiner were ignorant of Keane's 1836
      patent.
