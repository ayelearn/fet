****** Resource leveling ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In project_management, resource levelling is defined by A_Guide_to_the_Project
Management_Body_of_Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) as "A technique in which start and
finish dates are adjusted based on resource limitation with the goal of
balancing demand for resources with the available supply."[1] Resource leveling
problem could be formulated as an optimization problem.[2] The problem could be
solved by different optimization_algorithms such as exact algorithms or meta-
heuristic methods.[2][3]

When performing project_planning activities, the manager will attempt to
schedule certain tasks simultaneously. When more resources such as machines or
people are needed than are available, or perhaps a specific person is needed in
both tasks, the tasks will have to be rescheduled concurrently or even
sequentially to manage the constraint. Project planning resource leveling is
the process of resolving these conflicts. It can also be used to balance the
workload of primary resources over the course of the project[s], usually at the
expense of one of the traditional triple constraints (time, cost, scope).
When using specially designed project software, leveling typically means
resolving conflicts or over allocations in the project plan by allowing the
software to calculate delays and update tasks automatically. Project management
software leveling requires delaying tasks until resources are available. In
more complex environments, resources could be allocated across multiple,
concurrent projects thus requiring the process of resource leveling to be
performed at company level.
In either definition, leveling could result in a later project finish date if
the tasks affected are in the critical_path.
Resource leveling is also useful in the world of maintenance management. Many
organizations have maintenance backlogs. These backlogs consist of work orders.
In a "planned state" these work orders have estimates such as 2 electricians
for 8 hours. These work orders have other attributes such as report date,
priority, asset operational requirements, and safety concerns. These same
organizations have a need to create weekly schedules. Resource-leveling can
take the "work demand" and balance it against the resource pool availability
for the given week. The goal is to create this weekly schedule in advance of
performing the work. Without resource-leveling the organization (planner,
scheduler, supervisor) is most likely performing subjective selection. For the
most part, when it comes to maintenance scheduling, there is less, if any, task
interdependence, and therefore less need to calculate critical path and total
float.

The chart shows the number of people involved in a project and its change with
time. This is an example of Resource leveling in project management simulator
SimulTrain. [4]
Resource Leveling optimizes histogram of resources on a project.
