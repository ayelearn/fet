**** Antiquity ****
The word prognatus as written on the Sarcophagus_of_Lucius_Cornelius_Scipio
Barbatus (280 BC) reveals the full development of the Latin R by that time; the
letter P at the same time still retains its archaic shape distinguishing it
from Greek or Old Italic rho.
The original Semitic letter may have been inspired by an Egyptian_hieroglyph
for tp, "head".[citation_needed] It was used for /r/ by Semites because in
their language, the word for "head" was rÃƒÂªÃ…Â¡ (also the name of the letter). It
developed into Greek 'ÃÂ¡' Ã¡Â¿Â¥Ã¡Â¿Â¶ (rhÃƒÂ´) and Latin R.
The descending diagonal stroke develops as a graphic variant in some Western
Greek_alphabets (writing rho as [Greek_Rho_03.svg]), but it was not adopted in
most Old_Italic_alphabets; most Old Italic alphabets show variants of their rho
between a "P" and a "D" shape, but without the Western Greek descending stroke.
Indeed, the oldest known forms of the Latin alphabet itself of the 7th to 6th
centuries BC, in the Duenos and the Forum_inscription, still write r using the
"P" shape of the letter. The Lapis_Satricanus inscription shows the form of the
Latin alphabet around 500 BC. Here, the rounded, closing ÃÂ  shape of the p and
the ÃÂ¡ shape of the r have become difficult to distinguish. The descending
stroke of the Latin letter R has fully developed by the 3rd century BC, as seen
in the Tomb_of_the_Scipios sarcophagus inscriptions of that era. From around 50
AD, the letter P would be written with its loop fully closed, assuming the
shape formerly taken by R.
Late medieval illuminated initial
**** Cursive ****
18th-century example of use of r rotunda in English blackletter typography
Letter R from the alphabet by Luca_Pacioli, in De_divina_proportione (1509)
The minuscule (lowercase) form (r) developed through several variations on the
capital form. Along with Latin minuscule writing in general, it developed
ultimately from Roman_cursive via the uncial script of Late Antiquity into the
Carolingian_minuscule of the 9th century.
In handwriting, it was common not to close the bottom of the loop but continue
into the leg, saving an extra pen stroke. The loop-leg stroke shortened into
the simple arc used in the Carolingian minuscule and until today.
A calligraphic minuscule r, known as r_rotunda (ÃªÂÂ›), was used in the sequence
or, bending the shape of the r to accommodate the bulge of the o (as in oÃªÂÂ› as
opposed to or). Later, the same variant was also used where r followed other
lower case letters with a rounded loop towards the right (such as b, h, p) and
to write the geminate rr (as ÃªÂÂ›ÃªÂÂ›). Use of r rotunda was mostly tied to
blackletter typefaces, and the glyph fell out of use along with blackletter
fonts in English language contexts mostly by the 18th century.
Insular_script used a minuscule which retained two downward strokes, but which
did not close the loop ("Insular r", ÃªÂÂƒ); this variant survives in the Gaelic
type popular in Ireland until the mid-20th century (but now mostly limited to
decorative purposes).
***** Name *****
The name of the letter in Latin was er (/Ã‰Â›r/), following the pattern of other
letters representing continuants, such as F, L, M, N and S. This name is
preserved in French and many other languages. In Middle_English, the name of
the letter changed from /Ã‰Â›r/ to /ar/, following a pattern exhibited in many
other words such as farm (compare French ferme), and star (compare German
Stern).
In Hiberno-English the letter is called /Ã‰Â’r/ or /Ã‰Â”Ã‹Âr/, somewhat similar to
oar, ore, orr.[2][3][4]
The letter R is sometimes referred to as the littera canÃ„Â«na (literally 'canine
letter', often rendered in english as the dog's letter). This Latin term
referred to the Latin R was trilled to sound like a growling dog, a spoken
style referred to as vÃ…Âx canÃ„Â«na ('dog voice'). A good example of a trilled R
is in the Spanish word for dog, perro.[5]
In William_Shakespeare's Romeo_and_Juliet, such a reference is made by Juliet's
nurse in Act 2, scene 4, when she calls the letter R "the dog's name". The
reference is also found in Ben_Jonson's English Grammar.[6]

**** English ****
The letter &#x27e8;r&#x27e9; is the eighth most common letter in English and
the fourth-most common consonant (after &#x27e8;t&#x27e9;, &#x27e8;n&#x27e9;,
and &#x27e8;s&#x27e9;).[7]
The letter &#x27e8;r&#x27e9; is used to form the ending "-re", which is used in
certain words such as centre in some varieties of English spelling, such as
British_English. Canadian_English also uses the "-re" ending, unlike American
English, where the ending is usually replaced by "-er" (center). This does not
affect pronunciation.
**** Other languages ****
&#x27e8;r&#x27e9; represents a rhotic_consonant in many languages, as shown in
the table below.

                           'r-' in western parts, Norwegian in western and southern parts.
Other languages may use the letter &#x27e8;r&#x27e9; in their alphabets (or
Latin transliterations schemes) to represent rhotic consonants different from
the alveolar trill. In Haitian_Creole, it represents a sound so weak that it is
often written interchangeably with &#x27e8;w&#x27e9;, e.g. 'Kweyol' for
'Kreyol'.
Brazilian Portuguese has a great number of allophones of /ÃŠÂ/ such as [ÃÂ‡],
[h], [Ã‰Â¦], [x], [Ã‰Â£], [Ã‰Â¹] and [r], the latter three ones can be used only in
certain contexts ([Ã‰Â£] and [r] as &#x27e8;rr&#x27e9;; [Ã‰Â¹] in the syllable
coda, as an allophone of /Ã‰Â¾/ according to the European Portuguese norm and /
ÃŠÂ/ according to the Brazilian Portuguese norm). Usually at least two of them
are present in a single dialect, such as Rio_de_Janeiro's [ÃŠÂ], [ÃÂ‡], [Ã‰Â¦] and,
for a few speakers, [Ã‰Â£].
**** Other systems ****
The International_Phonetic_Alphabet uses several variations of the letter to
represent the different rhotic consonants; &#x27e8;r&#x27e9; represents the
alveolar_trill.
