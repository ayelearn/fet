Buoyancy (/ËbÉÉªÉnsi,_ËbuËjÉnsi/)[1][2] or upthrust, is an upward force
exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object. In a column
of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the
overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is
greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of
an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. The
pressure difference results in a net upward force on the object. The magnitude
of the force is proportional to the pressure difference, and (as explained by
Archimedes'_principle) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would
otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the displaced fluid.
For this reason, an object whose average density is greater than that of the
fluid in which it is submerged tends to sink. If the object is less dense than
the liquid, the force can keep the object afloat. This can occur only in a non-
inertial_reference_frame, which either has a gravitational_field or is
accelerating_due_to_a_force_other_than_gravity defining a "downward" direction.
[3]
The center of buoyancy of an object is the centroid of the displaced volume of
fluid.

***** Archimedes' principle[edit] *****
A metallic coin (an old British pound_coin) floats in mercury due to the
buoyancy force upon it and appears to float higher because of the surface
tension of the mercury.
Main article: Archimedes'_principle
[File:04. ÐÐ°Ð»Ð¸Ð»ÐµÐµÐ²Ð¾ ÑÐ¾Ð¿ÑÐµ.ogv]Play_media
The Galileo's Ball experiment, showing the different buoyancy of the same
object, depending on its surrounding medium. The ball has certain buoyancy in
water, but once ethanol is added (which is less dense than water), it reduces
the density of the medium, thus making the ball sink further down (reducing its
buoyancy).
Archimedes' principle is named after Archimedes of Syracuse, who first
discovered this law in 212 B.C.[4] For objects, floating and sunken, and in
gases as well as liquids (i.e. a fluid), Archimedes' principle may be stated
thus in terms of forces:
     Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by
     a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object
â with the clarifications that for a sunken object the volume of displaced
fluid is the volume of the object, and for a floating object on a liquid, the
weight of the displaced liquid is the weight of the object.
More tersely: buoyancy = weight of displaced fluid.
Archimedes' principle does not consider the surface_tension (capillarity)
acting on the body,[5] but this additional force modifies only the amount of
fluid displaced and the_spatial_distribution_of_the_displacement, so the
principle that buoyancy = weight of displaced fluid remains valid.
The weight of the displaced fluid is directly proportional to the volume of the
displaced fluid (if the surrounding fluid is of uniform density). In simple
terms, the principle states that the buoyancy force on an object is equal to
the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density of the fluid
multiplied by the submerged volume times the gravitational acceleration, g.
Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with
greater volume have greater buoyancy. This is also known as upthrust.
Suppose a rock's weight is measured as 10 newtons when suspended by a string in
a vacuum with gravity acting upon it. Suppose that when the rock is lowered
into water, it displaces water of weight 3 newtons. The force it then exerts on
the string from which it hangs would be 10 newtons minus the 3 newtons of
buoyancy force: 10 â 3 = 7 newtons. Buoyancy reduces the apparent weight of
objects that have sunk completely to the sea floor. It is generally easier to
lift an object up through the water than it is to pull it out of the water.
Assuming Archimedes' principle to be reformulated as follows,
          apparent immersed weight  =  weight  &#x2212;  weight of displaced
      fluid     {\displaystyle {\text{apparent immersed weight}}={\text
      {weight}}-{\text{weight of displaced fluid}}\,}  [\text{apparent immersed
      weight} = \text{weight} - \text{weight of displaced fluid}\,]
then inserted into the quotient of weights, which has been expanded by the
mutual volume
           density density of fluid   =   weight weight of displaced fluid   ,
      {\displaystyle {\frac {\text{density}}{\text{density of fluid}}}={\frac
      {\text{weight}}{\text{weight of displaced fluid}}},\,}  [ \frac { \text
      {density}} { \text{density of fluid} } = \frac { \text{weight}} { \text
      {weight of displaced fluid} }, \,]
yields the formula below. The density of the immersed object relative to the
density of the fluid can easily be calculated without measuring any volumes.:
           density of object density of fluid   =   weight   weight  &#x2212;
      apparent immersed weight        {\displaystyle {\frac {\text{density of
      object}}{\text{density of fluid}}}={\frac {\text{weight}}{{\text
      {weight}}-{\text{apparent immersed weight}}}}\,}  [ \frac { \text
      {density of object}} { \text{density of fluid} } = \frac { \text{weight}}
      { \text{weight} - \text{apparent immersed weight}}\,]
(This formula is used for example in describing the measuring principle of a
dasymeter and of hydrostatic_weighing.)
Example: If you drop wood into water, buoyancy will keep it afloat.
Example: A helium balloon in a moving car. During a period of increasing speed,
the air mass inside the car moves in the direction opposite to the car's
acceleration (i.e., towards the rear). The balloon is also pulled this way.
However, because the balloon is buoyant relative to the air, it ends up being
pushed "out of the way", and will actually drift in the same direction as the
car's acceleration (i.e., forward). If the car slows down, the same balloon
will begin to drift backward. For the same reason, as the car goes round a
curve, the balloon will drift towards the inside of the curve.
***** Forces and equilibrium[edit] *****

The equation to calculate the pressure inside a fluid in equilibrium is:
          f  + div  &#x03C3; = 0   {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} +\operatorname
      {div} \,\sigma =0}  [ \mathbf{f}+\operatorname{div}\,\sigma=0]
where f is the force density exerted by some outer field on the fluid, and Ï
is the Cauchy_stress_tensor. In this case the stress tensor is proportional to
the identity tensor:
          &#x03C3;  i j   = &#x2212; p  &#x03B4;  i j   .    {\displaystyle
      \sigma _{ij}=-p\delta _{ij}.\,}  [\sigma_{ij}=-p\delta_{ij}.\,]
Here Î´ij is the Kronecker_delta. Using this the above equation becomes:
          f  = &#x2207; p .    {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} =\nabla p.\,}
      [ \mathbf{f}=\nabla p.\,]
Assuming the outer force field is conservative, that is it can be written as
the negative gradient of some scalar valued function:
          f  = &#x2212; &#x2207; &#x03A6; .    {\displaystyle \mathbf {f} =-
      \nabla \Phi .\,}  [\mathbf{f}=-\nabla\Phi.\,]
Then:
         &#x2207; ( p + &#x03A6; ) = 0 &#x27F9; p + &#x03A6; =  constant  .
      {\displaystyle \nabla (p+\Phi )=0\Longrightarrow p+\Phi ={\text
      {constant}}.\,}  [ \nabla(p+\Phi)=0 \Longrightarrow p+\Phi = \text
      {constant}.\,]
Therefore, the shape of the open surface of a fluid equals the equipotential
plane of the applied outer conservative force field. Let the z-axis point
downward. In this case the field is gravity, so Î¦ = −Ïfgz where g is the
gravitational acceleration, Ïf is the mass density of the fluid. Taking the
pressure as zero at the surface, where z is zero, the constant will be zero, so
the pressure inside the fluid, when it is subject to gravity, is
         p =  &#x03C1;  f   g z .    {\displaystyle p=\rho _{f}gz.\,}
      [p=\rho_f g z.\,]
So pressure increases with depth below the surface of a liquid, as z denotes
the distance from the surface of the liquid into it. Any object with a non-zero
vertical depth will have different pressures on its top and bottom, with the
pressure on the bottom being greater. This difference in pressure causes the
upward buoyancy force.
The buoyancy force exerted on a body can now be calculated easily, since the
internal pressure of the fluid is known. The force exerted on the body can be
calculated by integrating the stress tensor over the surface of the body which
is in contact with the fluid:
          B  =    &#x222E;      &#x2061; &#x03C3;  d  A  .   {\displaystyle
      \mathbf {B} =\oint \sigma \,d\mathbf {A} .}  [\mathbf{B}=\oint \sigma \,
      d\mathbf{A}.]
The surface integral can be transformed into a volume integral with the help of
the Gauss_theorem:
          B  = &#x222B; div &#x2061; &#x03C3;  d V = &#x2212; &#x222B;  f   d V
      = &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  f    g  &#x222B;  d V = &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  f    g
      V   {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} =\int \operatorname {div} \sigma \,dV=-
      \int \mathbf {f} \,dV=-\rho _{f}\mathbf {g} \int \,dV=-\rho _{f}\mathbf
      {g} V}  [\mathbf{B}=\int \operatorname{div}\sigma \, dV = -\int \mathbf
      {f}\, dV = -\rho_f \mathbf{g} \int\,dV=-\rho_f \mathbf{g} V]
where V is the measure of the volume in contact with the fluid, that is the
volume of the submerged part of the body, since the fluid doesn't exert force
on the part of the body which is outside of it.
The magnitude of buoyancy force may be appreciated a bit more from the
following argument. Consider any object of arbitrary shape and volume V
surrounded by a liquid. The force the liquid exerts on an object within the
liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid with a volume equal to that of the
object. This force is applied in a direction opposite to gravitational force,
that is of magnitude:
         B =  &#x03C1;  f    V  disp    g ,    {\displaystyle B=\rho _{f}V_
      {\text{disp}}\,g,\,}  [B = \rho_f V_\text{disp}\, g, \,]
where Ïf is the density of the fluid, Vdisp is the volume of the displaced
body of liquid, and g is the gravitational_acceleration at the location in
question.
If this volume of liquid is replaced by a solid body of exactly the same shape,
the force the liquid exerts on it must be exactly the same as above. In other
words, the "buoyancy force" on a submerged body is directed in the opposite
direction to gravity and is equal in magnitude to
         B =  &#x03C1;  f   V g .    {\displaystyle B=\rho _{f}Vg.\,}  [B =
      \rho_f V g. \,]
The net_force on the object must be zero if it is to be a situation of fluid
statics such that Archimedes principle is applicable, and is thus the sum of
the buoyancy force and the object's weight
          F  net   = 0 = m g &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  f    V  disp   g
      {\displaystyle F_{\text{net}}=0=mg-\rho _{f}V_{\text{disp}}g\,}  [F_\text
      {net} = 0 = m g - \rho_f V_\text{disp} g \,]
If the buoyancy of an (unrestrained and unpowered) object exceeds its weight,
it tends to rise. An object whose weight exceeds its buoyancy tends to sink.
Calculation of the upwards force on a submerged object during its accelerating
period cannot be done by the Archimedes principle alone; it is necessary to
consider dynamics of an object involving buoyancy. Once it fully sinks to the
floor of the fluid or rises to the surface and settles, Archimedes principle
can be applied alone. For a floating object, only the submerged volume
displaces water. For a sunken object, the entire volume displaces water, and
there will be an additional force of reaction from the solid floor.
In order for Archimedes' principle to be used alone, the object in question
must be in equilibrium (the sum of the forces on the object must be zero),
therefore;
         m g =  &#x03C1;  f    V  disp   g ,    {\displaystyle mg=\rho _{f}V_
      {\text{disp}}g,\,}  [mg = \rho_f V_\text{disp} g, \,]
and therefore
         m =  &#x03C1;  f    V  disp   .    {\displaystyle m=\rho _{f}V_{\text
      {disp}}.\,}  [m = \rho_f V_\text{disp}.  \,]
showing that the depth to which a floating object will sink, and the volume of
fluid it will displace, is independent of the gravitational_field regardless of
geographic location.
      (Note: If the fluid in question is seawater, it will not have the same
      density (ρ) at every location. For this reason, a ship may display a
      Plimsoll_line.)
It can be the case that forces other than just buoyancy and gravity come into
play. This is the case if the object is restrained or if the object sinks to
the solid floor. An object which tends to float requires a tension restraint
force T in order to remain fully submerged. An object which tends to sink will
eventually have a normal_force of constraint N exerted upon it by the solid
floor. The constraint force can be tension in a spring scale measuring its
weight in the fluid, and is how apparent weight is defined.
If the object would otherwise float, the tension to restrain it fully submerged
is:
         T =  &#x03C1;  f   V g &#x2212; m g .    {\displaystyle T=\rho _{f}Vg-
      mg.\,}  [T = \rho_f V g - m g . \,]
When a sinking object settles on the solid floor, it experiences a normal_force
of:
         N = m g &#x2212;  &#x03C1;  f   V g .    {\displaystyle N=mg-\rho _
      {f}Vg.\,}  [N = m g - \rho_f V g . \,]
Another possible formula for calculating buoyancy of an object is by finding
the apparent weight of that particular object in the air (calculated in
Newtons), and apparent weight of that object in the water (in Newtons). To find
the force of buoyancy acting on the object when in air, using this particular
information, this formula applies:
      Buoyancy force = weight of object in empty space â weight of object
      immersed in fluid
The final result would be measured in Newtons.
Air's density is very small compared to most solids and liquids. For this
reason, the weight of an object in air is approximately the same as its true
weight in a vacuum. The buoyancy of air is neglected for most objects during a
measurement in air because the error is usually insignificant (typically less
than 0.1% except for objects of very low average density such as a balloon or
light foam).
**** Simplified model[edit] ****
Pressure distribution on an immersed cube
Forces on an immersed cube
Approximation of an arbitrary volume as a group of cubes
A simplified explanation for the integration of the pressure over the contact
area may be stated as follows:
Consider a cube immersed in a fluid with the upper surface horizontal.
The sides are identical in area, and have the same depth distribution,
therefore they also have the same pressure distribution, and consequently the
same total force resulting from hydrostatic pressure, exerted perpendicular to
the plane of the surface of each side.
There are two pairs of opposing sides, therefore the resultant horizontal
forces balance in both orthogonal directions, and the resultant force is zero.
The upward force on the cube is the pressure on the bottom surface integrated
over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant.
Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal bottom
surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the
area of the bottom surface.
Similarly, the downward force on the cube is the pressure on the top surface
integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is
constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the
horizontal top surface of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth
multiplied by the area of the top surface.
As this is a cube, the top and bottom surfaces are identical in shape and area,
and the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the cube is directly
proportional to the depth difference, and the resultant force difference is
exactly equal to the weight of the fluid that would occupy the volume of the
cube in its absence.
This means that the resultant upward force on the cube is equal to the weight
of the fluid that would fit into the volume of the cube, and the downward force
on the cube is its weight, in the absence of external forces.
This analogy is valid for variations in the size of the cube.
If two cubes are placed alongside each other with a face of each in contact,
the pressures and resultant forces on the sides or parts thereof in contact are
balanced and may be disregarded, as the contact surfaces are equal in shape,
size and pressure distribution, therefore the buoyancy of two cubes in contact
is the sum of the buoyancies of each cube. This analogy can be extended to an
arbitrary number of cubes.
An object of any shape can be approximated as a group of cubes in contact with
each other, and as the size of the cube is decreased, the precision of the
approximation increases. The limiting case for infinitely small cubes is the
exact equivalence.
Angled surfaces do not nullify the analogy as the resultant force can be split
into orthogonal components and each dealt with in the same way.
**** Static stability[edit] ****
Main article: Ship_stability
Illustration of the stability of bottom-heavy (left) and top-heavy (right)
ships with respect to the positions of their centres of buoyancy (CB) and
gravity (CG)
A floating object is stable if it tends to restore itself to an equilibrium
position after a small displacement. For example, floating objects will
generally have vertical stability, as if the object is pushed down slightly,
this will create a greater buoyancy force, which, unbalanced by the weight
force, will push the object back up.
Rotational stability is of great importance to floating vessels. Given a small
angular displacement, the vessel may return to its original position (stable),
move away from its original position (unstable), or remain where it is
(neutral).
Rotational stability depends on the relative lines of action of forces on an
object. The upward buoyancy force on an object acts through the center of
buoyancy, being the centroid of the displaced volume of fluid. The weight force
on the object acts through its center_of_gravity. A buoyant object will be
stable if the center of gravity is beneath the center of buoyancy because any
angular displacement will then produce a 'righting moment'.
The stability of a buoyant object at the surface is more complex, and it may
remain stable even if the centre of gravity is above the centre of buoyancy,
provided that when disturbed from the equilibrium position, the centre of
buoyancy moves further to the same side that the centre of gravity moves, thus
providing a positive righting moment. If this occurs, the floating object is
said to have a positive metacentric_height. This situation is typically valid
for a range of heel angles, beyond which the centre of buoyancy does not move
enough to provide a positive righting moment, and the object becomes unstable.
It is possible to shift from positive to negative or vice versa more than once
during a heeling disturbance, and many shapes are stable in more than one
position.

The atmosphere's_density depends upon altitude. As an airship rises in the
atmosphere, its buoyancy decreases as the density of the surrounding air
decreases. In contrast, as a submarine expels water from its buoyancy tanks, it
rises because its volume is constant (the volume of water it displaces if it is
fully submerged) while its mass is decreased.
**** Compressible objects[edit] ****
As a floating object rises or falls, the forces external to it change and, as
all objects are compressible to some extent or another, so does the object's
volume. Buoyancy depends on volume and so an object's buoyancy reduces if it is
compressed and increases if it expands.
If an object at equilibrium has a compressibility less than that of the
surrounding fluid, the object's equilibrium is stable and it remains at rest.
If, however, its compressibility is greater, its equilibrium is then unstable,
and it rises and expands on the slightest upward perturbation, or falls and
compresses on the slightest downward perturbation.
*** Submarines[edit] ***
See also: Submarine_Â§ Submersion_and_trimming
Submarines rise and dive by filling large ballast tanks with seawater. To dive,
the tanks are opened to allow air to exhaust out the top of the tanks, while
the water flows in from the bottom. Once the weight has been balanced so the
overall density of the submarine is equal to the water around it, it has
neutral buoyancy and will remain at that depth. Most military submarines
operate with a slightly negative buoyancy and maintain depth by using the
"lift" of the stabilizers with forward motion.[citation_needed]
*** Balloons[edit] ***
The height to which a balloon rises tends to be stable. As a balloon rises it
tends to increase in volume with reducing atmospheric pressure, but the balloon
itself does not expand as much as the air on which it rides. The average
density of the balloon decreases less than that of the surrounding air. The
weight of the displaced air is reduced. A rising balloon stops rising when it
and the displaced air are equal in weight. Similarly, a sinking balloon tends
to stop sinking.
*** Divers[edit] ***
Underwater divers are a common example of the problem of unstable buoyancy due
to compressibility. The diver typically wears an exposure suit which relies on
gas-filled spaces for insulation, and may also wear a buoyancy_compensator,
which is a variable volume buoyancy bag which is inflated to increase buoyancy
and deflated to decrease buoyancy. The desired condition is usually neutral
buoyancy when the diver is swimming in mid-water, and this condition is
unstable, so the diver is constantly making fine adjustments by control of lung
volume, and has to adjust the contents of the buoyancy compensator if the depth
varies.

Density column of liquids and solids: baby_oil, rubbing_alcohol (with red food
colouring), vegetable_oil, wax, water (with blue food colouring) and aluminium
If the weight of an object is less than the weight of the displaced fluid when
fully submerged, then the object has an average density that is less than the
fluid and when fully submerged will experience a buoyancy force greater than
its own weight. If the fluid has a surface, such as water in a lake or the sea,
the object will float and settle at a level where it displaces the same weight
of fluid as the weight of the object. If the object is immersed in the fluid,
such as a submerged submarine or air in a balloon, it will tend to rise. If the
object has exactly the same density as the fluid, then its buoyancy equals its
weight. It will remain submerged in the fluid, but it will neither sink nor
float, although a disturbance in either direction will cause it to drift away
from its position. An object with a higher average density than the fluid will
never experience more buoyancy than weight and it will sink. A ship will float
even though it may be made of steel (which is much denser than water), because
it encloses a volume of air (which is much less dense than water), and the
resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water.

   4. ^ Note: In the absence of surface tension, the mass of fluid displaced is
      equal to the submerged volume multiplied by the fluid density. High
      repulsive surface tension will cause the body to float higher than
      expected, though the same total volume will be displaced, but at a
      greater distance from the object. Where there is doubt about the meaning
      of "volume of fluid displaced", this should be interpreted as the
      overflow from a full container when the object is floated in it, or as
      the volume of the object below the average level of the fluid.
