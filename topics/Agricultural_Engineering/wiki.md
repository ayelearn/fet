Agricultural engineering is the engineering discipline that studies
agricultural production and processing. Agricultural engineering combines the
disciplines of mechanical, civil, electrical and chemical engineering
principles with a knowledge of agricultural principles according to
technological principles. A key goal of this discipline is to improve the
efficacy and sustainability of agricultural practices.[1] One of the leading
organizations in this industry is the American_Society_of_Agricultural_and
Biological_Engineers.[1]

***** ASABE standards[edit] *****
The ASABE provides safety and regulatory standards for the agricultural
industry. These standards and regulations are developed on an international
scale and include topics on fertilizers, soil conditions, fisheries, biofuels,
biogass, feed machinery, tractors, and machinery.[1]
***** History[edit] *****
The first curriculum in agricultural engineering was established at Iowa_State
University by Professor J. B. Davidson in 1903. The American Society of
Agricultural Engineers, now known as the American_Society_of_Agricultural_and
Biological_Engineers, was founded in 1907.[2] A full history of events directly
and indirectly influenced by agricultural engineering, see here.
***** Specialties[edit] *****
Agricultural engineers may engage in any of the following areas:
    * design of agricultural_machinery, equipment, and agricultural structures
    * internal_combustion_engines as applied to agricultural machinery
    * agricultural resource management (including land_use and water_use)
    * water management, conservation, and storage for crop irrigation and
      livestock production
    * surveying and land profiling
    * climatology and atmospheric_science
    * soil management and conservation, including erosion and erosion control
    * seeding, tillage, harvesting, and processing of crops
    * livestock production, including poultry, fish, and dairy animals
    * waste_management, including animal waste, agricultural residues, and
      fertilizer runoff
    * food_engineering and the processing of agricultural products
    * basic principles of circuit_analysis, as applied to electrical motors
    * physical and chemical properties of materials used in, or produced by,
      agricultural production
    * bioresource_engineering, which uses machines on the molecular level to
      help the environment.
    * Design_of_experiments related to crop and animal production
**** Agricultural engineers[edit] ****
Agricultural engineers may perform tasks such as planning, supervising and
managing the building of dairy effluent schemes, irrigation, drainage, flood
water control systems, performing environmental_impact_assessments,
agricultural product processing and interpret research results and implement
relevant practices. A large percentage of agricultural engineers work in
academia or for government agencies such as the United_States_Department_of
Agriculture or state agricultural_extension services. Some are consultants,
employed by private engineering firms, while others work in industry, for
manufacturers of agricultural machinery, equipment, processing technology, and
structures for housing livestock and storing crops. Agricultural engineers work
in production, sales, management, research and development, or applied_science.
In the United Kingdom the term Agricultural Engineer is often also used to
describe a person that repairs or modifies agricultural equipment.
***** Academic programs in agricultural and bio-systems engineering[edit] *****
Below is a listing of known academic programs that offer bachelor's degrees
(B.S. or B.S.E. or B.E / B.Tech) in what ABET terms "Agricultural_Engineering",
"Biosystems_Engineering", "Biological_Engineering", or similarly named
programs. ABET accredits college and university programs in the disciplines of
applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology.
