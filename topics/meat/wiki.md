Animal flesh eaten as food
A selection of uncooked red meat and poultry
Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.[1] Humans have hunted and killed
animals for meat since prehistoric times. The advent of civilization allowed
the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle.
This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with
the aid of slaughterhouses.
Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. It is edible raw, but is
normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety
of ways. Unprocessed meat will spoil_or_rot within hours or days as a result of
infection with and decomposition by bacteria and fungi.
Meat is important in economy and culture, even though its mass production and
consumption has been determined to pose risks for human health and the
environment. Many religions have rules about which meat may or may not be
eaten. Vegetarians may abstain from eating meat because of concerns about the
ethics_of_eating_meat, environmental effects of meat production or nutritional
effects of consumption.

***** Terminology *****
The word meat comes from the Old_English word mete, which referred to food in
general. The term is related to mad in Danish, mat in Swedish and Norwegian,
and matur in Icelandic and Faroese, which also mean 'food'. The word mete also
exists in Old_Frisian (and to a lesser extent, modern West_Frisian) to denote
important food, differentiating it from swiets (sweets) and dierfied (animal
feed).
Most often, meat refers to skeletal_muscle and associated fat and other
tissues, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as offal.[1]:1 Meat
is sometimes also used in a more restrictive sense to mean the flesh of
mammalian species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.) raised and prepared for human
consumption, to the exclusion of fish, other seafood, insects, poultry, or
other animals.[2][3]
In the context of food, meat can also refer to "the edible part of something as
distinguished from its covering (such as a husk or shell)", for example,
coconut meat.[3]
***** History *****
**** History of meat production ****
See also: History_of_agriculture
Paleontological evidence suggests that meat constituted a substantial
proportion of the diet of the earliest humans.[1]:2 Early hunter-gatherers
depended on the organized hunting of large animals such as bison and deer.[1]:2
The domestication of animals, of which we have evidence dating back to the end
of the last_glacial_period (c. 10,000 BCE),[1]:2 allowed the systematic
production of meat and the breeding of animals with a view to improving meat
production.[1]:2 Animals that are now principal sources of meat were
domesticated in conjunction with the development of early civilizations:
A typical shoulder cut of lamb
    * Sheep, originating from western Asia, were domesticated with the help of
      dogs prior to the establishment of settled agriculture, likely as early
      as the 8th millennium BCE.[1]:3 Several breeds of sheep were established
      in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt by 3500â3000 BCE.[1]:3 Today, more
      than 200 sheep-breeds exist.
    * Cattle were domesticated in Mesopotamia after settled agriculture was
      established about 5000 BCE,[1]:5 and several breeds were established by
      2500 BCE.[1]:6 Modern domesticated cattle fall into the groups Bos_taurus
      (European cattle) and Bos_taurus_indicus (zebu), both descended from the
      now-extinct aurochs.[1]:5 The breeding of beef_cattle, cattle optimized
      for meat production as opposed to animals best suited for work or dairy
      purposes, began in the middle of the 18th century.[1]:7
A Hereford bull, a breed of cattle frequently used in beef production.
    * Domestic_pigs, which are descended from wild_boars, are known to have
      existed about 2500 BCE in modern-day Hungary and in Troy; earlier pottery
      from Tell_es-Sultan (Jericho) and Egypt depicts wild pigs.[1]:8 Pork
      sausages and hams were of great commercial importance in Greco-Roman
      times.[1]:8 Pigs continue to be bred intensively as they are being
      optimized to produce meat best suited for specific meat products.[1]:9
Other animals are or have been raised or hunted for their flesh. The type of
meat consumed varies much between different cultures, changes over time,
depending on factors such as tradition and the availability of the animals. The
amount and kind of meat consumed also varies by income, both between countries
and within a given country.[4]
    * Horses are commonly eaten in France,[5] Italy, Germany and Japan, among
      other countries.[6] Horses and other large mammals such as reindeer were
      hunted during the late Paleolithic in western Europe.[7]
    * Dogs are consumed in China,[8] South_Korea[9] and Vietnam.[10] Dogs are
      also occasionally eaten in the Arctic regions.[11] Historically, dog meat
      has been consumed in various parts of the world, such as Hawaii,[12]
      Japan,[13] Switzerland[14] and Mexico.[15]
    * Cats are consumed in Southern China, Peru[16] and sometimes also in
      Northern_Italy.[17][18]
    * Guinea_pigs are raised for their flesh in the Andes.[19]
    * Whales and dolphins are hunted, partly for their flesh, in Japan, Alaska,
      Siberia, Canada, the Faroe_Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Saint_Vincent_and
      the_Grenadines and by two small communities in Indonesia.[20]
Modern agriculture employs a number of techniques, such as progeny_testing, to
speed artificial_selection by breeding animals to rapidly acquire the qualities
desired by meat producers.[1]:10 For instance, in the wake of well-publicised
health concerns associated with saturated_fats in the 1980s, the fat content of
United Kingdom beef, pork and lamb fell from 20â26 percent to 4â8 percent
within a few decades, due to both selective breeding for leanness and changed
methods of butchery.[1]:10 Methods of genetic_engineering aimed at improving
the meat production qualities of animals are now also becoming available.[1]:14
Fresh meat in a supermarket in North America
Even though it is a very old industry, meat production continues to be shaped
strongly by the evolving demands of customers. The trend towards selling meat
in pre-packaged cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle,
which are better suited to producing such cuts.[1]:11 Even more animals not
previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed, especially the more
agile and mobile species, whose muscles tend to be developed better than those
of cattle, sheep or pigs.[1]:11 Examples are the various antelope species, the
zebra, water_buffalo and camel,[1]:11ff as well as non-mammals, such as the
crocodile, emu and ostrich.[1]:13 Another important trend in contemporary meat
production is organic_farming which, while providing no organoleptic benefit to
meat so produced,[21] meets an increasing demand for organic meat.[22]
**** Cultural history ****
For most of human history, meat was a largely unquestioned part of the human
diet.[23]:1 Only in the 20th century did it begin to become a topic of
discourse and contention in society, politics and wider culture.[23]:11
*** Philosophy ***
The founders of Western_philosophy disagreed about the ethics_of_eating_meat.
Plato's Republic has Socrates describe the ideal state as vegetarian.
Pythagoras believed that humans and animals were equal and therefore
disapproved of meat consumption, as did Plutarch, whereas Zeno and Epicurus
were vegetarian but allowed meat-eating in their philosophy.[23]:10 Conversely,
Aristotle's Politics assert that animals, as inferior beings, exist to serve
humans, including as food. Augustine drew on Aristotle to argue that the
universe's natural hierarchy allows humans to eat animals, and animals to eat
plants.[23]:10 Enlightenment philosophers were likewise divided. Descartes
wrote that animals are merely animated machines, and Kant considered them
inferior beings for lack of discernment; means rather than ends.[23]:11 But
Voltaire and Rousseau disagreed. The latter argued that meat-eating is a social
rather than a natural act, because children aren't interested in meat.[23]:11
Later philosophers examined the changing practices of eating meat in the modern
age as part of a process of detachment from animals as living beings. Norbert
Elias, for instance, noted that in medieval times cooked animals were brought
to the table whole, but that since the Renaissance only the edible parts are
served, which are no longer recognizably part of an animal.[23]:12 Modern
eaters, according to NoÃ«lie_Vialles, demand an "ellipsis" between meat and
dead animals; for instance, calves' eyes are no longer considered a delicacy as
in the Middle Ages, but provoke disgust.[23]:12 Even in the English language,
distinctions emerged between animals and their meat, such as between cattle and
beef, pigs and pork.[23]:12 Fernand_Braudel wrote that since the European diet
of the 15th and 16th century was particularly heavy in meat, European
colonialism helped export meat-eating across the globe, as colonized peoples
took up the culinary habits of their colonizers, which they associated with
wealth and power.[23]:15
***** Consumption *****
Further information: List_of_countries_by_meat_consumption_per_capita and List
of_countries_by_meat_consumption
Meat consumption varies worldwide, depending on cultural or religious
preferences, as well as economic conditions. Vegetarians choose not to eat meat
because of ethical, economic, environmental, religious or health concerns that
are associated with meat production and consumption.
While meat consumption in most industrialized countries is at high, stable
levels...[24]
... meat consumption in emerging economies is on the rise.[25]
According to the analysis of the FAO the overall consumption for white_meat
between 1990 and 2009 has dramatically increased. For example, poultry meat has
increased by 76.6% per kilo per capita and pig meat by 19.7%. However, on the
contrary, bovine meat has decreased from 10.4 kilograms (23 lb)/capita in 1990
to 9.6 kilograms (21 lb)/capita in 2009.[26]
Overall, diets that include meat are the most common worldwide according to the
results of a 2018 Ipsos_MORI study of 16â64 years olds in 28 different
countries. Ipsos states âAn omnivorous diet is the most common diet globally,
with non-meat diets (which can include fish) followed by over a tenth of the
global population.â Approximately 87% of people include meat in their diet in
some frequency. 73% of meat eaters included it in their diet regularly and 14%
consumed meat only occasionally or infrequently. Estimates of the non-meat
diets were also broken down. About 3% of people followed vegan diets; where
consumption of meat, seafood, eggs, and dairy are abstained from. About 5% of
people followed vegetarian diets; where consumption of meat and seafood are
abstained from, but egg and/or dairy consumption isnât strictly restricted.
About 3% of people followed pescetarian diets; where consumption of meat is
abstained from, seafood is consumed, and egg and/or dairy consumption may or
may not be strictly restricted.[27]
***** Growth and development of meat animals *****
Agricultural_science has identified several factors bearing on the growth and
development of meat in animals.
**** Genetics ****
Trait                   Heritability[28]
Reproductive efficiency 2â10%
Meat quality            15â30%
Growth                  20â40%
Muscle/fat ratio        40â60%
Several economically important traits in meat animals are heritable to some
degree (see the adjacent table) and can thus be selected for by animal
breeding. In cattle, certain growth features are controlled by recessive_genes
which have not so far been controlled, complicating breeding.[1]:18 One such
trait is dwarfism; another is the doppelender or "double_muscling" condition,
which causes muscle_hypertrophy and thereby increases the animal's commercial
value.[1]:18 Genetic_analysis continues to reveal the genetic mechanisms that
control numerous aspects of the endocrine_system and, through it, meat growth
and quality.[1]:19
Genetic_engineering techniques can shorten breeding programs significantly
because they allow for the identification and isolation of genes coding for
desired traits, and for the reincorporation of these genes into the animal
genome.[1]:21 To enable such manipulation, research is ongoing (as of 2006
[update]) to map_the_entire_genome of sheep, cattle and pigs.[1]:21 Some
research has already seen commercial application. For instance, a recombinant
bacterium has been developed which improves the digestion of grass in the rumen
of cattle, and some specific features of muscle fibres have been genetically
altered.[1]:22
Experimental reproductive_cloning of commercially important meat animals such
as sheep, pig or cattle has been successful. Multiple asexual reproduction of
animals bearing desirable traits is anticipated,[1]:22 although this is not yet
practical on a commercial scale.
**** Environment ****
Heat regulation in livestock is of great economic significance, because mammals
attempt to maintain a constant optimal body temperature. Low temperatures tend
to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to retard it.[1]:22
Depending on their size, body shape and insulation through tissue and fur, some
animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others (e.g.
cattle) a broad one.[1]:23 Static magnetic_fields, for reasons still unknown,
also retard animal development.[1]:23
**** Nutrition ****
The quality and quantity of usable meat depends on the animal's plane of
nutrition, i.e., whether it is over- or underfed. Scientists disagree, however,
about how exactly the plane of nutrition influences carcase composition.[1]:25
The composition of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, is also
an important factor regulating animal growth.[1]:26 Ruminants, which may digest
cellulose, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal
microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess.[1]:27
Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also
Environmental_impact below), several techniques are employed or experimented
with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of
feed with formalin to protect amino_acids during their passage through the
rumen, the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed
concentrates, or the partial conversion of petroleum hydrocarbons to protein
through microbial action.[1]:30
In plant feed, environmental factors influence the availability of crucial
nutrients or micronutrients, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many
ailments.[1]:29 In Australia, for instance, where the soil contains limited
phosphate, cattle are being fed additional phosphate to increase the efficiency
of beef production.[1]:28 Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas
were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture;
this was at length found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil.[1]:29
Plant toxins are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, sodium
fluoroacetate, found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting
the cellular_metabolism.[1]:29 Certain man-made pollutants such as
methylmercury and some pesticide residues present a particular hazard due to
their tendency to bioaccumulate in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.[1]:30
**** Human intervention ****
Meat producers may seek to improve the fertility of female animals through the
administration of gonadotrophic or ovulation-inducing hormones.[1]:31 In pig
production, sow infertility is a common problem â possibly due to excessive
fatness.[1]:32 No methods currently exist to augment the fertility of male
animals.[1]:32 Artificial_insemination is now routinely used to produce animals
of the best possible genetic quality, and the efficiency of this method is
improved through the administration of hormones that synchronize the ovulation
cycles within groups of females.[1]:33
Growth_hormones, particularly anabolic agents such as steroids, are used in
some countries to accelerate muscle growth in animals.[1]:33 This practice has
given rise to the beef_hormone_controversy, an international trade dispute. It
may also decrease the tenderness of meat, although research on this is
inconclusive,[1]:35 and have other effects on the composition of the muscle
flesh.[1]:36ff Where castration is used to improve control over male animals,
its side effects are also counteracted by the administration of hormones.[1]:33
Sedatives may be administered to animals to counteract stress factors and
increase weight gain.[1]:39 The feeding of antibiotics to certain animals has
been shown to improve growth rates also.[1]:39 This practice is particularly
prevalent in the USA, but has been banned in the EU, partly because it causes
antimicrobial_resistance in pathogenic microorganisms.[1]:39
***** Biochemical composition *****
Numerous aspects of the biochemical composition of meat vary in complex ways
depending on the species, breed, sex, age, plane of nutrition, training and
exercise of the animal, as well as on the anatomical location of the
musculature involved.[1]:94â126 Even between animals of the same litter and
sex there are considerable differences in such parameters as the percentage of
intramuscular fat.[1]:126
**** Main constituents ****
Adult mammalian muscle flesh consists of roughly 75 percent water, 19 percent
protein, 2.5 percent intramuscular fat, 1.2 percent carbohydrates and 2.3
percent other soluble non-protein substances. These include nitrogenous
compounds, such as amino_acids, and inorganic substances such as minerals.[1]:
76
Muscle proteins are either soluble in water (sarcoplasmic proteins, about 11.5
percent of total muscle mass) or in concentrated salt solutions (myofibrillar
proteins, about 5.5 percent of mass).[1]:75 There are several hundred
sarcoplasmic proteins.[1]:77 Most of them â the glycolytic enzymes â are
involved in the glycolytic_pathway, i.e., the conversion of stored energy into
muscle power.[1]:78 The two most abundant myofibrillar proteins, myosin and
actin,[1]:79 are responsible for the muscle's overall structure. The remaining
protein mass consists of connective_tissue (collagen and elastin) as well as
organelle tissue.[1]:79
Fat in meat can be either adipose_tissue, used by the animal to store energy
and consisting of "true fats" (esters of glycerol with fatty_acids),[1]:82 or
intramuscular fat, which contains considerable quantities of phospholipids and
of unsaponifiable constituents such as cholesterol.[1]:82
**** Red and white meat ****
Blade steaks are an example of "red" meat
Meat can be broadly classified as "red" or "white" depending on the
concentration of myoglobin in muscle fibre. When myoglobin is exposed to
oxygen, reddish oxymyoglobin develops, making myoglobin-rich meat appear red.
The redness of meat depends on species, animal age, and fibre type: Red_meat
contains more narrow muscle fibres that tend to operate over long periods
without rest,[1]:93 while white_meat contains more broad fibres that tend to
work in short fast bursts.[1]:93
Generally, the meat of adult mammals such as cows, sheep, and horses is
considered red, while chicken and turkey breast meat is considered white.[29]
***** Nutritional information *****
            Typical nutritional content of
           110 grams (4 oz or .25 lb) of meat
Source                 calories  protein   carbs fat

All muscle tissue is very high in protein, containing all of the essential
amino_acids, and in most cases is a good source of zinc, vitamin_B12, selenium,
phosphorus, niacin, vitamin_B6, choline, riboflavin and iron.[30] Several forms
of meat are also high in vitamin_K.[31] Muscle tissue is very low in
carbohydrates and does not contain dietary fiber.[32] While taste quality may
vary between meats, the proteins, vitamins, and minerals available from meats
are generally consistent.
The fat content of meat can vary widely depending on the species and breed of
animal, the way in which the animal was raised, including what it was fed, the
anatomical part of the body, and the methods of butchering and cooking. Wild
animals such as deer are typically leaner than farm animals, leading those
concerned about fat content to choose game such as venison. Decades of breeding
meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with
less fat. The fatty deposits that exist with the muscle fibers in meats soften
meat when it is cooked and improve the flavor through chemical changes
initiated through heat that allow the protein and fat molecules to interact.
The fat, when cooked with meat, also makes the meat seem juicier. However, the
nutritional contribution of the fat is mainly calories as opposed to protein.
As fat content rises, the meat's contribution to nutrition declines. In
addition, there is cholesterol associated with fat surrounding the meat. The
cholesterol is a lipid associated with the kind of saturated fat found in meat.
The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with, though not
definitively the cause of, significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the
human diet.[33]
The table in this section compares the nutritional content of several types of
meat. While each kind of meat has about the same content of protein and
carbohydrates, there is a very wide range of fat content.
***** Production *****
Main articles: Meat_industry, Meat_packing_industry, Animal_slaughter,
Slaughterhouse, and Butchery
See also: Fishing_industry
Meat is produced by killing an animal and cutting flesh out of it. These
procedures are called slaughter and butchery, respectively. There is ongoing
research into producing meat_in_vitro, that is, outside of animals.
**** Transport ****
Upon reaching a predetermined age or weight, livestock are usually transported
en masse to the slaughterhouse. Depending on its length and circumstances, this
may exert stress and injuries on the animals, and some may die en route.[1]:129
Unnecessary stress in transport may adversely affect the quality of the meat.
[1]:129 In particular, the muscles of stressed animals are low in water and
glycogen, and their pH fails to attain acidic values, all of which results in
poor meat quality.[1]:130 Consequently, and also due to campaigning by animal
welfare groups, laws and industry practices in several countries tend to become
more restrictive with respect to the duration and other circumstances of
livestock transports.
**** Slaughter ****
Animals are usually slaughtered by being first stunned and then exsanguinated
(bled out). Death results from the one or the other procedure, depending on the
methods employed. Stunning can be effected through asphyxiating the animals
with carbon_dioxide, shooting them with a gun or a captive_bolt_pistol, or
shocking them with electric current.[1]:134ff In most forms of ritual
slaughter, stunning is not allowed.
Draining as much blood as possible from the carcass is necessary because blood
causes the meat to have an unappealing appearance and is a breeding ground for
microorganisms.[1]:1340 The exsanguination is accomplished by severing the
carotid_artery and the jugular_vein in cattle and sheep, and the anterior_vena
cava in pigs.[1]:137
*** Negative effects on slaughterhouse workers ***
Further information: Meat_industry and Labor_rights_in_American_meatpacking
industry
The act of slaughtering animals for meat, or of raising or transporting animals
for slaughter, may engender both psychological stress[34][35][36][37][38][39]
[40][41][42][43][44][45] and physical trauma[46][47][48][49][50] in the people
involved. In 2010, Human_Rights_Watch described slaughterhouse line work in the
United States as a human rights crime.[51] In a 2018 study in the Italian
Journal of Food Safety, slaughterhouse workers are instructed to wear ear
protectors to protect their hearing from the constant screams of animals being
killed.[52]
**** Dressing and cutting ****
After exsanguination, the carcass is dressed; that is, the head, feet, hide
(except hogs and some veal), excess fat, viscera and offal are removed, leaving
only bones and edible muscle.[1]:138 Cattle and pig carcases, but not those of
sheep, are then split in half along the mid ventral axis, and the carcase is
cut into wholesale pieces.[1]:138 The dressing and cutting sequence, long a
province of manual labor, is progressively being fully automated.[1]:138
**** Conditioning ****
In the meat products sector of the Rungis_International_Market, France.
Under hygienic conditions and without other treatment, meat can be stored at
above its freezing point (â1.5 Â°C) for about six weeks without spoilage,
during which time it undergoes an aging process that increases its tenderness
and flavor.[1]:141
During the first day after death, glycolysis continues until the accumulation
of lactic_acid causes the pH to reach about 5.5. The remaining glycogen, about
18 g per kg, is believed to increase the water-holding capacity and tenderness
of the flesh when cooked.[1]:87 Rigor_mortis sets in a few hours after death as
ATP is used up, causing actin and myosin to combine into rigid actomyosin and
lowering the meat's water-holding capacity,[1]:90 causing it to lose water
("weep").[1]:146 In muscles that enter rigor in a contracted position, actin
and myosin filaments overlap and cross-bond, resulting in meat that is tough on
cooking[1]:144 â hence again the need to prevent pre-slaughter stress in the
animal.
Over time, the muscle proteins denature in varying degree, with the exception
of the collagen and elastin of connective_tissue,[1]:142 and rigor mortis
resolves. Because of these changes, the meat is tender and pliable when cooked
just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during
rigor.[1]:142 As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates,
which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat.[1]:146
Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning. Hypoxanthine, a breakdown
product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products
of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.[1]:155
**** Additives ****
The word "sausage" is derived from Old_French saussiche, from the Latin word
salsus meaning "salted".[53]
When meat is industrially processed in preparation of consumption, it may be
enriched with additives to protect or modify its flavor or color, to improve
its tenderness, juiciness or cohesiveness, or to aid with its preservation.
Meat additives include the following:[54]
    * Salt is the most frequently used additive in meat processing. It imparts
      flavor but also inhibits microbial growth, extends the product's shelf
      life and helps emulsifying finely processed products, such as sausages.
      Ready-to-eat meat products normally contain about 1.5 to 2.5 percent
      salt.[54] Salt water or similar substances may also be injected into
      poultry meat to improve the taste and increase the weight, in a process
      called plumping.
    * Nitrite is used in curing_meat to stabilize the meat's color and flavor,
      and inhibits the growth of spore-forming microorganisms such as C.
      botulinum. The use of nitrite's precursor nitrate is now limited to a few
      products such as dry sausage, prosciutto or parma_ham.[54]
    * Phosphates used in meat processing are normally alkaline polyphosphates
      such as sodium_tripolyphosphate. They are used to increase the water-
      binding and emulsifying ability of meat proteins, but also limit lipid
      oxidation and flavor loss, and reduce microbial growth.[54]
    * Erythorbate or its equivalent ascorbic_acid (vitamin C) is used to
      stabilize the color of cured meat.[54]
    * Sweeteners such as sugar or corn_syrup impart a sweet flavor, bind water
      and assist surface browning during cooking in the Maillard_reaction.[54]
    * Seasonings impart or modify flavor. They include spices or oleoresins
      extracted from them, herbs, vegetables and essential_oils.[54]
    * Flavorings such as monosodium_glutamate impart or strengthen a particular
      flavor.[54]
    * Tenderizers break down collagens to make the meat more palatable for
      consumption. They include proteolytic_enzymes, acids, salt and phosphate.
      [54]
    * Dedicated antimicrobials include lactic, citric and acetic_acid, sodium
      diacetate, acidified sodium_chloride or calcium_sulfate, cetylpyridinium
      chloride, activated lactoferrin, sodium or potassium_lactate, or
      bacteriocins such as nisin.[54]
    * Antioxidants include a wide range of chemicals that limit lipid
      oxidation, which creates an undesirable "off flavor", in precooked meat
      products.[54]
    * Acidifiers, most often lactic or citric acid, can impart a tangy or tart
      flavor note, extend shelf-life, tenderize fresh meat or help with protein
      denaturation and moisture release in dried meat. They substitute for the
      process of natural fermentation that acidifies some meat products such as
      hard salami or prosciutto.[54]
**** Misidentification ****
With the rise of complex supply_chains, including cold_chains, in developed
economies, the distance between the farmer or fisherman and customer has grown,
increasing the possibility for intentional and unintentional misidentification
of meat at various points in the supply chain.[55]
In 2013, reports emerged across Europe that products labelled as containing
beef actually_contained_horse_meat.[56] In February 2013 a study was published
showing that about one-third of raw fish are misidentified across the United
States.[55]
**** Imitation meat ****
Various forms of imitation_meat have been created for people who wish not to
eat meat but still want to taste its flavor and texture. Meat imitates are
typically some form of processed soybean (tofu, tempeh), but they can also be
based on wheat_gluten, pea_protein_isolate, or even fungi (quorn).
***** Environmental impact *****
Main article: Environmental_impact_of_meat_production
Biomass of mammals on Earth[57]
  Livestock, mostly cattle and pigs (60%)
  Humans (36%)
  Wild_animals (4%)
Various environmental effects are associated with meat production. Among these
are greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy use, water use, water quality
changes, and effects on grazed ecosystems.
The livestock sector may be the largest source of water pollution (due to
animal wastes, fertilizers, pesticides), and it contributes to emergence of
antibiotic resistance. It accounts for over 8% of global human water use. It is
by far the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for nearly 40% of the
global land surface.[58] It is a significant driver of biodiversity_loss, as it
causes deforestation, ocean dead_zones, land_degradation, pollution, and
overfishing.[59][60][61][62][63]
The occurrence, nature and significance of environmental effects varies among
livestock production systems.[64] Grazing of livestock can be beneficial for
some wildlife species, but not for others.[65][66] Targeted grazing of
livestock is used as a food-producing alternative to herbicide use in some
vegetation management.[67]
**** Climate change ****
Meat production is responsible for 14.5% and possibly up to 51% of the world's
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.[68][69] However, greenhouse gas
emission depends on the economy and country: animal products (meat, fish, and
dairy) account for 22%, 65%, and 70% of emissions in the diets of lower-
middleâ, upper-middleâ, and high-income nations, respectively. Some nations
show very different impacts to counterparts within the same group, with Brazil
and Australia having emissions over 200% higher than the average of their
respective income groups and driven by meat consumption.[70]
According to a report produced by United_Nations_Environment_Programme's (UNEP)
international panel for sustainable resource management, a worldwide transition
in the direction of a meat and dairy free diet is indispensable if adverse
global climate change were to be prevented.[71] A 2019 report in The_Lancet
recommended that global meat (and sugar) consumption be reduced by 50 percent
to mitigate climate change.[72] Meat consumption in Western societies needs to
be reduced by up to 90% according to a 2018 study published in Nature.[73][74]
**** Biodiversity loss ****
Meat consumption is considered one of the primary contributors of the sixth
mass_extinction.[75][62][76] A 2017 study by the World_Wildlife_Fund found that
60% of global biodiversity_loss is attributable to meat-based diets, in
particular from the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of
billions of farm animals for human consumption puts an enormous strain on
natural resources resulting in a wide-scale loss of lands and species.[77]
Currently, livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth,
followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%).[78][79] In November 2017,
15,364 world scientists signed a Warning_to_Humanity calling for, among other
things, drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of meat and "dietary
shifts towards mostly plant-based foods".[80] The 2019 Global_Assessment_Report
on_Biodiversity_and_Ecosystem_Services, released by IPBES, also recommended
reductions meat consumption in order to mitigate biodiversity loss.[81]
A July 2018 study in Science says that meat consumption is set to rise as the
human population increases along with affluence, which will increase greenhouse
gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity.[82]
**** Environmental benefits ****
Meat-producing livestock can provide environmental benefits through waste
reduction, e.g. conversion of human-inedible residues of food crops.[83][84]
Manure from meat-producing livestock is used as fertilizer; it may be composted
before application to food crops. Substitution of animal manures for synthetic
fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant, as between
43 and 88 MJ of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture
of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.[85]
***** Spoilage and preservation *****
Main articles: Meat_spoilage and Meat_preservation
The spoilage of meat occurs, if untreated, in a matter of hours or days and
results in the meat becoming unappetizing, poisonous or infectious. Spoilage is
caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of
meat by bacteria and fungi, which are borne by the animal itself, by the people
handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much
longer time â though not indefinitely â if proper hygiene is observed
during production and processing, and if appropriate food_safety, food
preservation and food_storage procedures are applied. Without the application
of preservatives and stabilizers, the fats in meat may also begin to rapidly
decompose after cooking or processing, leading to an objectionable taste known
as warmed_over_flavor.
***** Methods of preparation *****

Pork ribs being smoked
Fresh meat can be cooked for immediate consumption, or be processed, that is,
treated for longer-term preservation and later consumption, possibly after
further preparation. Fresh meat cuts or processed cuts may produce iridescence,
commonly thought to be due to spoilage but actually caused by structural
coloration and diffraction of the light.[86] A common additive to processed
meats, both for preservation and because it prevents discoloring, is sodium
nitrite, which, however, is also a source of health concerns, because it may
form carcinogenic nitrosamines when heated.[87]
Meat is prepared in many ways, as steaks, in stews, fondue, or as dried_meat
like beef jerky. It may be ground then formed into patties (as hamburgers or
croquettes), loaves, or sausages, or used in loose form (as in "sloppy joe" or
Bolognese_sauce).
Some meat is cured by smoking, which is the process of flavoring, cooking, or
preserving food by exposing it to the smoke from burning or smoldering plant
materials, most often wood. In Europe, alder is the traditional smoking wood,
but oak is more often used now, and beech to a lesser extent. In North_America,
hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, alder, maple, and fruit-tree woods are commonly
used for smoking. Meat can also be cured by pickling, preserving in salt or
brine (see salted_meat and other curing methods). Other kinds of meat are
marinated and barbecued, or simply boiled, roasted, or fried.
Meat is generally eaten cooked, but many recipes call for raw beef, veal or
fish (tartare). Steak_tartare is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced
raw beef or horse_meat.[88][89] Meat is often spiced or seasoned, particularly
with meat products such as sausages. Meat dishes are usually described by their
source (animal and part of body) and method of preparation (e.g., a beef rib).
Meat is a typical base for making sandwiches. Popular varieties of sandwich
meat include ham, pork, salami and other sausages, and beef, such as steak,
roast_beef, corned_beef, pepperoni, and pastrami. Meat can also be molded or
pressed (common for products that include offal, such as haggis and scrapple)
and canned.
***** Health *****
See also: Health_concerns_associated_with_red_meat
There is concern and debate regarding the potential association of meat, in
particular red and processed meat, with a variety of health risks. A study of
400,000 subjects conducted by the European_Prospective_Investigation_into
Cancer_and_Nutrition and published in 2013 showed "a moderate positive
association between processed meat consumption and mortality, in particular due
to cardiovascular diseases, but also to cancer."[90]
A 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries. The
metastudy reported mortality_ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer
deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat
eaters to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters and vegans shared the highest mortality
ratio of 1.00.[91]
In response to changing prices as well as health concerns about saturated fat
and cholesterol, consumers have altered their consumption of various meats. A
USDA report points out that consumption of beef in the United States between
1970â1974 and 1990â1994 dropped by 21%, while consumption of chicken
increased by 90%.[92] During the same period of time, the price of chicken
dropped by 14% relative to the price of beef. From 1995â1996, beef
consumption increased due to higher_supplies_and_lower_prices.
The 2015â2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans asked men and teenage boys to
increase their consumption of vegetables or other underconsumed foods because
they eat too much protein.[93]
**** Contamination ****
Various toxic compounds can contaminate meat, including heavy_metals,
mycotoxins, pesticide residues, dioxins, polychlorinated_biphenyl (PCBs).
Processed, smoked and cooked meat may contain carcinogens such as polycyclic
aromatic_hydrocarbons.[94]
Toxins may be introduced to meat as part of animal feed, as veterinary drug
residues, or during processing and cooking. Often, these compounds can be
metabolized in the body to form harmful by-products. Negative effects depend on
the individual genome, diet, and history of the consumer.[95] Any chemical's
toxicity is also dependent on the dose and timing of exposure.
**** Cancer ****
Main article: Red_meat_Â§ Cancer
There are concerns about a relationship between the consumption of meat, in
particular processed and red meat, and increased cancer risk. The International
Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer (IARC), a specialized agency of the World_Health
Organization (WHO), classified processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs,
sausages) as, "carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence
in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer."
IARC also classified red meat as "probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A),
based on limited evidence that the consumption of red meat causes cancer in
humans and strong mechanistic evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect."[96]
[97][98]
**** Heart disease ****
The correlation of consumption to increased risk of heart_disease is
controversial. Some studies fail to find a link between red meat consumption
and heart disease[99] (although the same study found statistically significant
correlation between the consumption of processed meat and coronary heart
disease). A large cohort study of Seventh-Day Adventists in California found
that the risk of heart disease is three times greater for 45-64-year-old men
who eat meat daily, versus those who did not eat meat. This study compared
adventists to the general population and not other Seventh Day Adventists who
ate meat and did not specifically distinguish red and processed meat in its
assessment.[100]
A major Harvard University study[101] in 2010 involving over one million people
who ate meat found that only processed meat had an adverse risk in relation to
coronary heart disease. The study suggests that eating 50 g (less than 2
ounces) of processed meat per day increases risk of coronary heart disease by
42%, and diabetes by 19%. Equivalent levels of fat, including saturated fats,
in unprocessed meat (even when eating twice as much per day) did not show any
deleterious effects, leading the researchers to suggest that "differences in
salt and preservatives, rather than fats, might explain the higher risk of
heart disease and diabetes seen with processed meats, but not with unprocessed
red meats." A 2017 meta-analyses of randomized_controlled_trials found that
eating more than 0.5 servings of meat per-day does not increase lipids, blood
pressure, lipoproteins, or other heart disease risk factors.[102]
**** Obesity ****
Prospective analysis suggests that meat consumption is positively associated
with weight gain in men and women.[103] The National_Cattlemen's_Beef
Association countered by stating that meat consumption may not be associated
with fat gain.[104] In response, the authors of the original study controlled
for just abdominal fat across a sample of 91,214 people and found that even
when controlling for calories and lifestyle factors, meat consumption is linked
with obesity.[105] Additional studies and reviews have confirmed the finding
that greater meat consumption is positively linked with greater weight gain
even when controlling for calories, and lifestyle factors.[106][107]
**** Bacterial contamination ****
Bacterial contamination has been seen with meat products. A 2011 study by the
Translational_Genomics_Research_Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the
meat and poultry in U.S. grocery stores were contaminated with S._aureus, with
more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics.[108] A 2018
investigation by the Bureau_of_Investigative_Journalism and The_Guardian found
that around 15 percent of the US population suffers from foodborne illnesses
every year. The investigation also highlighted unsanitary conditions in US-
based meat plants, which included meat products covered in excrement and
abscesses "filled with pus".[109]
**** Cooking ****
Meat can transmit certain diseases, but complete cooking and avoiding
recontamination reduces this possibility.[110]
Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking muscle meat creates
heterocyclic_amines (HCAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk in
humans. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute published results of a
study which found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less
than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well
or well-done.[111] While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid
HCAs fully, the National_Cancer_Institute states that cooking meat below
212 Â°F (100 Â°C) creates "negligible amounts" of HCAs. Also, microwaving meat
before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90%.[112]
Nitrosamines, present in processed and cooked foods, have been noted as being
carcinogenic, being linked to colon cancer. Also, toxic compounds called PAHs,
or polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons, present in processed, smoked and cooked
foods, are known to be carcinogenic.[94]
***** Meat in society *****
Meat is part of the human diet in most cultures, where it often has symbolic
meaning and important social functions.[113] Many people, however, choose not
to eat meat (this is referred to as vegetarianism) or any food made from
animals (veganism). The reasons for not eating all or some meat may include
ethical objections to killing animals for food, health concerns, environmental
concerns or religious dietary_laws.
**** Ethics of eating meat ****
Main article: Ethics_of_eating_meat
Ethical issues regarding the consumption of meat include objecting to the act
of killing animals or to the agricultural_practices used in meat production.
Reasons for objecting to killing animals for consumption may include animal
rights, environmental_ethics, or an aversion to inflicting pain or harm on
other sentient_creatures. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the
flesh of certain animals (such as cows, pigs, cats, dogs, horses, or rabbits)
due to cultural or religious traditions.
Some people eat only the flesh of animals that they believe have not been
mistreated, and abstain from the flesh of animals raised in factory_farms or
else abstain from particular products, such as foie_gras and veal.
Some techniques of intensive agriculture may be cruel to animals: foie gras is
a food_product made from the liver of ducks or geese that have been force_fed
corn to fatten the organ; veal is criticised because the veal calves may be
highly restricted in movement, have unsuitable flooring, spend their entire
lives indoors, experience prolonged deprivation (sensory, social, and
exploratory), and be more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.
[114]
**** Religious traditions ****
Main article: Vegetarianism_and_religion
The religion of Jainism has always opposed eating meat, and there are also
schools_of_Buddhism and Hinduism that condemn the eating of meat. Jewish
dietary rules (Kashrut) allow certain (kosher) meat and forbid other (treif).
The rules include prohibitions on the consumption of unclean_animals (such as
pork, shellfish including mollusca and crustacea, and most insects), and
mixtures of meat and milk. Similar rules apply in Islamic_dietary_laws: The
Quran explicitly forbids meat from animals that die naturally, blood, the meat
of swine (porcine animals, pigs), and animals dedicated to other than Allah
(either undedicated or dedicated to idols) which are haram as opposed to halal.
Sikhism forbids meat of slowly slaughtered animals ("kutha") and prescribes
killing animals with a single strike ("jhatka"), but some Sikh groups oppose
eating any meat.[115]
**** Psychology ****
Main article: Psychology_of_eating_meat
Research in applied_psychology has investigated practices of meat eating in
relation to morality, emotions, cognition, and personality characteristics.
[116] Psychological research suggests meat eating is correlated with
masculinity,[117] support_for_social_hierarchy,[118] and reduced openness_to
experience.[119] Research into the consumer_psychology of meat is relevant both
to meat_industry marketing[120] and to advocates of reduced meat consumption.
[121][122]
**** Meat and gender ****
Unlike most other food, meat is not perceived as gender-neutral, and is
particularly associated with men and masculinity. Sociological research,
ranging from African tribal societies to contemporary barbecues, indicates that
men are much more likely to participate in preparing meat than other food.[23]:
15 This has been attributed to the influence of traditional male gender_roles,
in view of a "male familiarity with killing" or roasting being more violent as
opposed to boiling.[23]:15 By and large, at least in modern societies, men also
tend to consume more meat than women, and men often prefer red meat whereas
women tend to prefer chicken and fish.[23]:16
