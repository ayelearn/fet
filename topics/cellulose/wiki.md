Cellulose is an organic_compound with the formula (C
6H
10O
5)
n, a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many
thousands of Î²(1â4)_linked D-glucose units.[3][4] Cellulose is an important
structural component of the primary cell_wall of green_plants, many forms of
algae and the oomycetes. Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms.
[5] Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth.[6] The cellulose
content of cotton fiber is 90%, that of wood is 40â50%, and that of dried
hemp is approximately 57%.[7][8][9]
Cellulose is mainly used to produce paperboard and paper. Smaller quantities
are converted into a wide variety of derivative products such as cellophane and
rayon. Conversion of cellulose from energy_crops into biofuels such as
cellulosic_ethanol is under development as a renewable_fuel source. Cellulose
for industrial use is mainly obtained from wood_pulp and cotton.[6]
Some animals, particularly ruminants and termites, can digest cellulose with
the help of symbiotic micro-organisms that live in their guts, such as
Trichonympha. In human_nutrition, cellulose is a non-digestible constituent of
insoluble dietary_fiber, acting as a hydrophilic bulking_agent for feces and
potentially aiding in defecation.

***** History[edit] *****
Cellulose was discovered in 1838 by the French chemist Anselme_Payen, who
isolated it from plant matter and determined its chemical formula.[3][10][11]
Cellulose was used to produce the first successful thermoplastic_polymer,
celluloid, by Hyatt Manufacturing Company in 1870. Production of rayon
("artificial silk") from cellulose began in the 1890s and cellophane was
invented in 1912. Hermann_Staudinger determined the polymer structure of
cellulose in 1920. The compound was first chemically synthesized (without the
use of any biologically derived enzymes) in 1992, by Kobayashi and Shoda.[12]

***** Structure and properties[edit] *****
Cellulose has no taste, is odorless, is hydrophilic with the contact_angle of
20â30 degrees,[13] is insoluble in water and most organic solvents, is chiral
and is biodegradable. It was shown to melt at 467 Â°C in pulse tests made by
Dauenhauer et al. (2016).[14] It can be broken down chemically into its glucose
units by treating it with concentrated mineral acids at high temperature.[15]
Cellulose is derived from D-glucose units, which condense through Î²(1â4)-
glycosidic_bonds. This linkage motif contrasts with that for Î±(1â4)-
glycosidic bonds present in starch and glycogen. Cellulose is a straight chain
polymer. Unlike starch, no coiling or branching occurs and the molecule adopts
an extended and rather stiff rod-like conformation, aided by the equatorial
conformation of the glucose residues. The multiple hydroxyl_groups on the
glucose from one chain form hydrogen_bonds with oxygen atoms on the same or on
a neighbor chain, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming
microfibrils with high tensile_strength. This confers tensile strength in cell
walls where cellulose microfibrils are meshed into a polysaccharide matrix. The
high tensile strength of plant stems and of the tree wood also arises from the
arrangement of cellulose fibers intimately distributed into the lignin matrix.
The mechanical role of cellulose fibers in the wood matrix responsible for its
strong structural resistance, can somewhat be compared to that of the
reinforcement_bars in concrete, lignin playing here the role of the hardened
cement_paste acting as the "glue" in between the cellulose fibers.

Cotton fibres represent the purest natural form of cellulose, containing more
than 90% of this polysaccharide.
Compared to starch, cellulose is also much more crystalline. Whereas starch
undergoes a crystalline to amorphous transition when heated beyond 60â70 Â°C
in water (as in cooking), cellulose requires a temperature of 320 Â°C and
pressure of 25 MPa to become amorphous in water.[16]
Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding
to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Natural cellulose
is cellulose I, with structures IÎ± and IÎ². Cellulose produced by bacteria and
algae is enriched in IÎ± while cellulose of higher plants consists mainly of
IÎ². Cellulose in regenerated_cellulose fibers is cellulose II. The conversion
of cellulose I to cellulose II is irreversible, suggesting that cellulose I is
metastable and cellulose II is stable. With various chemical treatments it is
possible to produce the structures cellulose III and cellulose IV.[17]
Many properties of cellulose depend on its chain length or degree_of
polymerization, the number of glucose units that make up one polymer molecule.
Cellulose from wood pulp has typical chain lengths between 300 and 1700 units;
cotton and other plant fibers as well as bacterial cellulose have chain lengths
ranging from 800 to 10,000 units.[6] Molecules with very small chain length
resulting from the breakdown of cellulose are known as cellodextrins; in
contrast to long-chain cellulose, cellodextrins are typically soluble in water
and organic solvents.
Cellulose contains 44.44% carbon, 6.17% hydrogen, and 49.39% oxygen. The
chemical formula of cellulose is (C6H10O5)n where n is the degree of
polymerization and represents the number of glucose groups.[18]
Plant-derived cellulose is usually found in a mixture with hemicellulose,
lignin, pectin and other substances, while bacterial_cellulose is quite pure,
has a much higher water content and higher tensile strength due to higher chain
lengths.[6]:3384
Cellulose is soluble in Schweizer's_reagent, cupriethylenediamine (CED),
cadmiumethylenediamine (Cadoxen), N-methylmorpholine_N-oxide, and lithium
chloride / dimethylacetamide.[19] This is used in the production of regenerated
celluloses (such as viscose and cellophane) from dissolving_pulp. Cellulose is
also soluble in many kinds of ionic_liquids.[20]
Cellulose consists of crystalline and amorphous regions. By treating it with
strong acid, the amorphous regions can be broken up, thereby producing
nanocrystalline_cellulose, a novel material with many desirable properties.[21]
Recently, nanocrystalline_cellulose was used as the filler phase in bio-based
polymer matrices to produce nanocomposites with superior thermal and mechanical
properties.[22]
***** Processing[edit] *****
**** Assay[edit] ****
Given a cellulose-containing material, the carbohydrate portion that does not
dissolve in a 17.5% solution of sodium_hydroxide at 20 Â°C is Î± cellulose,
which is true cellulose.[clarification_needed] Acidification of the extract
precipitates Î² cellulose. The portion that dissolves in base but does not
precipitate with acid is Î³ cellulose.[citation_needed]
Cellulose can be assayed using a method described by Updegraff (1969),[4] where
the fiber is dissolved in acetic and nitric_acid to remove lignin,
hemicellulose, and xylosans. The resulting cellulose is allowed to react with
anthrone in sulfuric_acid. The resulting coloured compound is assayed
spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of approximately 635 nm.
In addition, cellulose can be represented by the difference between acid
detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL).[citation_needed]
Luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes can also be used to detect cellulose
using fluorescence_microscopy or spectrofluorometric methods.[23]
**** Biosynthesis[edit] ****
In plants cellulose is synthesized at the plasma_membrane by rosette terminal
complexes (RTCs). The RTCs are hexameric protein structures, approximately 25
nm in diameter, that contain the cellulose_synthase enzymes that synthesise the
individual cellulose chains.[24] Each RTC floats in the cell's plasma membrane
and "spins" a microfibril into the cell_wall.
RTCs contain at least three different cellulose_synthases, encoded by CesA
genes, in an unknown stoichiometry.[25] Separate sets of CesA genes are
involved in primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis. There are known to be
about seven subfamilies in the CesA superfamily. These cellulose syntheses use
UDP-glucose to form the Î²(1â4)-linked cellulose.[26]
Cellulose synthesis requires chain initiation and elongation, and the two
processes are separate. CesA glucosyltransferase initiates cellulose
polymerization using a steroid primer, sitosterol-beta-glucoside, and UDP-
glucose.[27] Cellulose_synthase utilizes UDP-D-glucose precursors to elongate
the growing cellulose chain. A cellulase may function to cleave the primer from
the mature chain.
Cellulose is also synthesised by tunicate animals, particularly in the tests of
ascidians (where the cellulose was historically termed "tunicine" (tunicin)).
[28]
**** Breakdown (cellulolysis)[edit] ****
Cellulolysis is the process of breaking down cellulose into smaller
polysaccharides called cellodextrins or completely into glucose units; this is
a hydrolysis reaction. Because cellulose molecules bind strongly to each other,
cellulolysis is relatively difficult compared to the breakdown of other
polysaccharides.[29] However, this process can be significantly intensified in
a proper solvent, e.g. in an ionic_liquid.[30]
Most mammals have limited ability to digest dietary fiber such as cellulose.
Some ruminants like cows and sheep contain certain symbiotic anaerobic bacteria
(such as Cellulomonas and Ruminococcus spp.) in the flora of the rumen, and
these bacteria produce enzymes called cellulases that help the microorganism to
digest cellulose; the breakdown products are then used by the bacteria for
proliferation.[31] The bacterial mass is later digested by the ruminant in its
digestive_system (stomach and small_intestine). Horses use cellulose in their
diet by fermentation_in_their_hindgut via symbiotic bacteria which produce
cellulase to digest cellulose.[citation_needed] Similarly, some termites
contain in their hindguts certain flagellate protozoa producing such enzymes,
whereas others contain bacteria or may produce cellulase.[32]
The enzymes used to cleave the glycosidic_linkage in cellulose are glycoside
hydrolases including endo-acting cellulases and exo-acting glucosidases. Such
enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include
dockerins and carbohydrate-binding_modules.[33]
**** Breakdown (thermolysis)[edit] ****
At temperatures above 350 Â°C, cellulose undergoes thermolysis (also called
âpyrolysisâ), decomposing into solid char, vapors, aerosols, and gases such
as carbon_dioxide.[34] Maximum yield of vapors which condense to a liquid
called bio-oil is obtained at 500 Â°C.[35]
Semi-crystalline cellulose polymers react at pyrolysis temperatures
(350â600 Â°C) in a few seconds; this transformation has been shown to occur
via a solid-to-liquid-to-vapor transition, with the liquid (called intermediate
liquid cellulose or molten cellulose) existing for only a fraction of a second.
[36] Glycosidic bond cleavage produces short cellulose chains of two-to-seven
monomers comprising the melt. Vapor bubbling of intermediate liquid cellulose
produces aerosols, which consist of short chain anhydro-oligomers derived from
the melt.[37]
Continuing decomposition of molten cellulose produces volatile compounds
including levoglucosan, furans, pyrans, light oxygenates and gases via primary
reactions.[38] Within thick cellulose samples, volatile compounds such as
levoglucosan undergo âsecondary reactionsâ to volatile products including
pyrans and light oxygenates such as glycolaldehyde.[39]
***** Hemicellulose[edit] *****
Main article: Hemicellulose
Hemicelluloses are polysaccharides related to cellulose that comprise about 20%
of the biomass of land_plants. In contrast to cellulose, hemicelluloses are
derived from several sugars in addition to glucose, especially xylose but also
including mannose, galactose, rhamnose, and arabinose. Hemicelluloses consist
of shorter chains â between 500 and 3000 sugar units.[40] Furthermore,
hemicelluloses are branched, whereas cellulose is unbranched.
***** Derivatives[edit] *****
The hydroxyl groups (-OH) of cellulose can be partially or fully reacted with
various reagents to afford derivatives with useful properties like mainly
cellulose esters and cellulose ethers (-OR). In principle, though not always in
current industrial practice, cellulosic polymers are renewable resources.

Cellulose for industrial use is mainly obtained from wood_pulp and cotton.[6]
The kraft_process is used to separate cellulose from lignin, another major
component of plant matter.
    * Paper products: Cellulose is the major constituent of paper, paperboard,
      and card_stock.
    * Fibers: Cellulose is the main ingredient of textiles made from cotton,
      linen, and other plant_fibers. It can be turned into rayon, an important
      fiber that has been used for textiles since the beginning of the 20th
      century. Both cellophane and rayon are known as "regenerated cellulose
      fibers"; they are identical to cellulose in chemical structure and are
      usually made from dissolving_pulp via viscose. A more recent and
      environmentally friendly method to produce a form of rayon is the Lyocell
      process.
    * Consumables: Microcrystalline_cellulose (E460i) and powdered cellulose
      (E460ii) are used as inactive fillers in drug tablets[41] and a wide
      range of soluble cellulose derivatives, E numbers E461 to E469, are used
      as emulsifiers, thickeners and stabilizers in processed foods. Cellulose
      powder is, for example, used in processed cheese to prevent caking inside
      the package. Cellulose occurs naturally in some foods and is an additive
      in manufactured foods, contributing an indigestible component used for
      texture and bulk, potentially aiding in defecation.[42]
    * Science: Cellulose is used in the laboratory as a stationary phase for
      thin_layer_chromatography. Cellulose_fibers are also used in liquid
      filtration, sometimes in combination with diatomaceous_earth or other
      filtration media, to create a filter bed of inert material.
    * Energy crops:
      Main article: Energy_crop
      The major combustible component of non-food energy_crops is cellulose,
      with lignin second. Non-food energy crops produce more usable energy than
      edible energy crops (which have a large starch component), but still
      compete with food crops for agricultural land and water resources.[43]
      Typical non-food energy crops include industrial_hemp (though outlawed in
      some countries), switchgrass, Miscanthus, Salix (willow), and Populus
      (poplar) species.
    * Biofuel: TU-103, a strain of Clostridium bacteria found in zebra waste,
      can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel.[44][45]
    * Building material: Hydroxyl bonding of cellulose in water produces a
      sprayable, moldable material as an alternative to the use of plastics and
      resins. The recyclable material can be made water- and fire-resistant. It
      provides sufficient strength for use as a building material.[46]
      Cellulose_insulation made from recycled paper is becoming popular as an
      environmentally preferable material for building_insulation. It can be
      treated with boric_acid as a fire_retardant.
    * Miscellaneous: Cellulose can be converted into cellophane, a thin
      transparent film. It is the base material for the celluloid that was used
      for photographic and movie films until the mid-1930s. Cellulose is used
      to make water-soluble adhesives and binders such as methyl_cellulose and
      carboxymethyl_cellulose which are used in wallpaper_paste. Cellulose is
      further used to make hydrophilic and highly absorbent sponges. Cellulose
      is the raw material in the manufacture of nitrocellulose (cellulose
      nitrate) which is used in smokeless_gunpowder.
    * Pharmaceuticals: Cellulose derivatives, such as microcrystalline
      cellulose (MCC), have the advantages of retaining water, being a
      stabilizer and thickening_agent, and in reinforcement of drug tablets.
