Lowest and supporting layer of a structure
Shallow_foundations of a house versus the deep_foundations of a skyscraper.
In engineering, a foundation is the element of a structure which connects it to
the ground, and transfers loads from the structure to the ground. Foundations
are generally considered either shallow or deep.[1] Foundation engineering is
the application of soil_mechanics and rock_mechanics (Geotechnical_engineering)
in the design of foundation elements of structures.

***** Purpose[edit] *****
Foundations provide the structure's stability from the ground.
    * To distribute the weight of the structure over large area so as to avoid
      over-loading of the soil beneath.
    * To anchor the structures against the changing natural forces like
      Earthquakes, floods, frost-heave, tornado or wind.
    * To load the sub-stratum evenly and thus prevent unequal settlement.
    * To provide a level surface for building operations.
    * To take the structure deep into the ground and thus increase its
      stability, preventing overloading.
    * Specially designed foundation helps in avoiding the lateral movements of
      the supporting material.
***** Requirements of a Good Foundation[edit] *****
The design and the construction of a well-performing foundation must possess
some basic requirements that must not be ignored. They are:
    * The design and the construction of the foundation is done such that it
      can sustain as well as transmit the dead and the imposed loads to the
      soil. This transfer has to be carried out without resulting in any form
      of settlement that can result in any form of stability issues for the
      structure.
    * Differential settlements can be avoided by having a rigid base for the
      foundation. These issues are more pronounced in areas where the
      superimposed loads are not uniform in nature.
    * Based on the soil and area it is recommended to have a deeper foundation
      so that it can guard any form of damage or distress. These are mainly
      caused due to the problem of shrinkage and swelling because of
      temperature changes.
    * The location of the foundation chosen must be an area that is not
      affected or influenced by future works or factors.
***** Historic foundation types[edit] *****

**** Earthfast or post in ground construction[edit] ****
Buildings and structures have a long history of being built with wood in
contact with the ground.[2][3] Post_in_ground construction may technically have
no foundation. Timber_pilings were used on soft or wet ground even below stone
or masonry walls.[4] In marine construction and bridge building a crisscross of
timbers or steel beams in concrete is called grillage.[5]
**** Padstones[edit] ****
Perhaps the simplest foundation is the padstone, a single stone which both
spreads the weight on the ground and raises the timber off the ground.[6]
Staddle_stones are a specific type of padstones.
**** Stone foundations[edit] ****
Dry_stone and stones laid in mortar to build foundations are common in many
parts of the world. Dry laid stone foundations may have been painted with
mortar after construction. Sometimes the top, visible course of stone is hewn,
quarried stones.[7] Besides using mortar, stones can also be put in a gabion.
[8] One disadvantage is that if using regular steel rebars, the gabion would
last much less long than when using mortar (due to rusting). Using weathering
steel rebars could reduce this disadvantage somewhat.
**** Rubble trench foundations[edit] ****
Main article: Rubble_trench_foundation
Rubble trench foundations are a shallow trench filled with rubble or stones.
These foundations extend below the frost_line and may have a drain pipe which
helps groundwater drain away. They are suitable for soils with a capacity of
more than 10 tonnes/m2 (2,000 pounds per square foot).

***** Modern foundation types[edit] *****
**** Shallow foundations[edit] ****
Main article: Shallow_foundation
[File:ConstrucciÃ³n de una cimentaciÃ³n por zapata aislada.ogv]Play_media
Shallow foundation construction example
Shallow foundations, often called footings, are usually embedded about a metre
or so into soil. One common type is the spread footing which consists of strips
or pads of concrete (or other materials) which extend below the frost_line and
transfer the weight from walls and columns to the soil or bedrock.
Another common type of shallow foundation is the slab-on-grade foundation where
the weight of the structure is transferred to the soil through a concrete slab
placed at the surface. Slab-on-grade foundations can be reinforced mat slabs,
which range from 25 cm to several meters thick, depending on the size of the
building, or post-tensioned slabs, which are typically at least 20 cm for
houses, and thicker for heavier structures.
**** Deep foundations[edit] ****
Main article: Deep_foundation
A deep foundation is used to transfer the load of a structure down through the
upper weak layer of topsoil to the stronger layer of subsoil below. There are
different types of deep footings including impact driven piles, drilled shafts,
caissons, helical piles, geo-piers and earth stabilized columns. The naming
conventions for different types of footings vary between different engineers.
Historically, piles were wood, later steel, reinforced_concrete, and pre-
tensioned_concrete.
*** Monopile foundation[edit] ***
Main article: Monopile_foundation
A monopile foundation is a type of deep_foundation which uses a single,
generally large-diameter, structural element embedded into the earth to support
all the loads (weight, wind, etc.) of a large above-surface structure.
A large number of monopile foundations[9] have been utilized in recent years
for economically constructing fixed-bottom offshore_wind_farms in shallow-water
subsea locations.[10] For example, a single wind_farm off_the_coast_of_England
went online in 2008 with over 100 turbines, each mounted on a 4.74-meter-
diameter monopile footing in ocean depths up to 16 metres of water.[11]
***** Design[edit] *****
Inadequate foundations in muddy soils below sea level caused these houses in
the Netherlands to subside.
Foundations are designed to have an adequate load capacity depending on the
type of subsoil/rock supporting the foundation by a geotechnical_engineer, and
the footing itself may be designed structurally by a structural_engineer. The
primary design concerns are settlement and bearing_capacity. When considering
settlement, total settlement and differential settlement is normally
considered. Differential settlement is when one part of a foundation settles
more than another part. This can cause problems to the structure which the
foundation is supporting. Expansive_clay soils can also cause problems.
