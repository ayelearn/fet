****** Atmospheric thermodynamics ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
Atmospheric thermodynamics is the study of heat-to-work transformations (and
their reverse) that take place in the earth's atmosphere and manifest as
weather or climate. Atmospheric thermodynamics use the laws of classical
thermodynamics, to describe and explain such phenomena as the properties of
moist air, the formation of clouds, atmospheric convection, boundary layer
meteorology, and vertical instabilities in the atmosphere. Atmospheric
thermodynamic_diagrams are used as tools in the forecasting of storm
development. Atmospheric thermodynamics forms a basis for cloud microphysics
and convection parameterizations used in numerical weather models and is used
in many climate considerations, including convective-equilibrium climate
models.

***** Overview[edit] *****
The atmosphere is an example of a non-equilibrium system.[1] Atmospheric
thermodynamics describes the effect of buoyant forces that cause the rise of
less dense (warmer) air, the descent of more dense air, and the transformation
of water from liquid to vapor (evaporation) and its condensation. Those
dynamics are modified by the force_of_the_pressure_gradient and that motion is
modified by the Coriolis_force. The tools used include the law of energy
conservation, the ideal_gas_law, specific heat capacities, the assumption of
isentropic_processes (in which entropy is a constant), and moist adiabatic
processes (during which no energy is transferred as heat). Most of tropospheric
gases are treated as ideal gases and water_vapor, with its ability to change
phase from vapor, to liquid, to solid, and back is considered as one of the
most important trace components of air.
Advanced topics are phase_transitions of water, homogeneous and in-homogeneous
nucleation, effect of dissolved substances on cloud condensation, role of
supersaturation on formation of ice crystals and cloud droplets. Considerations
of moist air and cloud theories typically involve various temperatures, such as
equivalent potential temperature, wet-bulb and virtual temperatures. Connected
areas are energy, momentum, and mass_transfer, turbulence interaction between
air particles in clouds, convection, dynamics of tropical cyclones, and large
scale dynamics of the atmosphere.
The major role of atmospheric thermodynamics is expressed in terms of adiabatic
and diabatic forces acting on air_parcels included in primitive_equations of
air motion either as grid resolved or subgrid parameterizations. These
equations form a basis for the numerical weather and climate predictions.
***** History[edit] *****
In the early 19th century thermodynamicists such as Sadi_Carnot, Rudolf
Clausius, and Ãmile_Clapeyron developed mathematical models on the dynamics of
fluid bodies and vapors related to the combustion and pressure cycles of
atmospheric steam engines; one example is the ClausiusâClapeyron_equation. In
1873, thermodynamicist Willard_Gibbs published "Graphical Methods in the
Thermodynamics of Fluids."
Thermodynamic diagram developed in the 19th century is still used to calculate
quantities such as convective available potential energy or air stability.
These sorts of foundations naturally began to be applied towards the
development of theoretical models of atmospheric thermodynamics which drew the
attention of the best minds. Papers on atmospheric thermodynamics appeared in
the 1860s that treated such topics as dry and moist adiabatic_processes. In
1884 Heinrich_Hertz devised first atmospheric thermodynamic diagram (emagram).
[2] Pseudo-adiabatic process was coined by von_Bezold describing air as it is
lifted, expands, cools, and eventually precipitates its water vapor; in 1888 he
published voluminous work entitled "On the thermodynamics of the atmosphere".
[3]
In 1911 von Alfred_Wegener published a book "Thermodynamik der AtmosphÃ¤re",
Leipzig, J. A. Barth. From here the development of atmospheric thermodynamics
as a branch of science began to take root. The term "atmospheric
thermodynamics", itself, can be traced to Frank_W._Verys 1919 publication: "The
radiant properties of the earth from the standpoint of atmospheric
thermodynamics" (Occasional scientific papers of the Westwood Astrophysical
Observatory). By the late 1970s various textbooks on the subject began to
appear. Today, atmospheric thermodynamics is an integral part of weather
forecasting.

***** Applications[edit] *****
**** Hadley Circulation[edit] ****
The Hadley Circulation can be considered as a heat engine.[4] The Hadley
circulation is identified with rising of warm and moist air in the equatorial
region with the descent of colder air in the subtropics corresponding to a
thermally driven direct circulation, with consequent net production of kinetic
energy. The thermodynamic efficiency of the Hadley system, considered as a heat
engine, has been relatively constant over the 1979~2010 period, averaging 2.6%.
Over the same interval, the power generated by the Hadley regime has risen at
an average rate of about 0.54 TW per yr; this reflects an increase in energy
input to the system consistent with the observed trend in the tropical sea
surface temperatures.
**** Tropical cyclone Carnot cycle[edit] ****
Air is being moistened as it travels toward convective system. Ascending motion
in a deep convective core produces air expansion, cooling, and condensation.
Upper level outflow visible as an anvil cloud is eventually descending
conserving mass (rysunek â Robert Simmon).
The thermodynamic behavior of a hurricane can be modelled as a heat engine [5]
that operates between the heat reservoir of the sea at a temperature of about
300K (27 Â°C) and the heat sink of the tropopause at a temperature of about
200K (â72 Â°C) and in the process converts heat energy into mechanical energy
of winds. Parcels of air traveling close to the sea surface take up heat and
water vapor, the warmed air rises and expands and cools as it does so causes
condensation and precipitation. The rising air, and condensation, produces
circulatory winds that are propelled by the Coriolis_force, which whip up waves
and increase the amount of warm moist air that powers the cyclone. Both a
decreasing temperature in the upper troposphere or an increasing temperature of
the atmosphere close to the surface will increase the maximum winds observed in
hurricanes. When applied to hurricane dynamics it defines a Carnot heat engine
cycle and predicts maximum hurricane intensity.
**** Water vapor and global climate change[edit] ****
Main articles: ClausiusâClapeyron_relation and August-Roche-Magnus
approximation
The ClausiusâClapeyron_relation shows how the water-holding capacity of the
atmosphere increases by about 8% per Celsius increase in temperature. (It does
not directly depend on other parameters like the pressure or density.) This
water-holding capacity, or "equilibrium_vapor_pressure", can be approximated
using the August-Roche-Magnus_formula
          e  s   ( T ) = 6.1094 exp &#x2061;  (    17.625 T   T + 243.04    )
      {\displaystyle e_{s}(T)=6.1094\exp \left({\frac {17.625T}
      {T+243.04}}\right)}  [ e_s(T)= 6.1094 \exp \left( \frac{17.625T}
      {T+243.04} \right)]
(where      e  s   ( T )   {\displaystyle e_{s}(T)}  [e_{s}(T)] is the
equilibrium or saturation_vapor_pressure in hPa, and     T   {\displaystyle T}
[T] is temperature in degrees Celsius). This shows that when atmospheric
temperature increases (e.g., due to greenhouse_gases) the absolute_humidity
should also increase exponentially (assuming a constant relative_humidity).
However, this purely thermodynamic argument is subject of considerable debate
because convective_processes might cause extensive drying due to increased
areas of subsidence, efficiency_of_precipitation could be influenced by the
intensity of convection, and because cloud_formation is related to relative
humidity.[citation_needed]
