Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics, quantum theory, the wave
mechanical model, or matrix mechanics), including quantum_field_theory, is a
fundamental theory in physics which describes nature at the smallest scales of
energy levels of atoms and subatomic_particles.[2]
Classical_physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, describes
nature at ordinary (macroscopic) scale. Most theories in classical physics can
be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large
(macroscopic) scale.[3] Quantum mechanics differs from classical_physics in
that energy, momentum, angular_momentum and other quantities of a bound system
are restricted to discrete_values (quantization); objects have characteristics
of both particles and waves (wave-particle_duality); and there are limits to
the precision with which quantities can be measured (uncertainty_principle).
[note_1]
Quantum mechanics gradually_arose from theories to explain observations which
could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max_Planck's solution
in 1900 to the black-body_radiation problem, and from the correspondence
between energy and frequency in Albert_Einstein's 1905_paper which explained
the photoelectric_effect. Early_quantum_theory was profoundly re-conceived in
the mid-1920s by Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner_Heisenberg, Max_Born and others.
The modern theory is formulated in various specially_developed_mathematical
formalisms. In one of them, a mathematical function, the wave_function,
provides information about the probability_amplitude of position, momentum, and
other physical properties of a particle.
Important applications of quantum theory[5] include quantum_chemistry, quantum
optics, quantum_computing, superconducting_magnets, light-emitting_diodes, and
the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor,
medical_and_research_imaging such as magnetic_resonance_imaging and electron
microscopy. Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted
in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule DNA.[6]

Main article: History_of_quantum_mechanics
Scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th
centuries, when scientists such as Robert_Hooke, Christiaan_Huygens and
Leonhard_Euler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental
observations.[7] In 1803, Thomas_Young, an English polymath, performed the
famous double-slit_experiment that he later described in a paper titled On the
nature of light and colours. This experiment played a major role in the general
acceptance of the wave_theory_of_light.
In 1838, Michael_Faraday discovered cathode_rays. These studies were followed
by the 1859 statement of the black-body_radiation problem by Gustav_Kirchhoff,
the 1877 suggestion by Ludwig_Boltzmann that the energy states of a physical
system can be discrete, and the 1900 quantum hypothesis of Max_Planck.[8]
Planck's hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete "quanta"
(or energy packets) precisely matched the observed patterns of black-body
radiation.
In 1896, Wilhelm_Wien empirically determined a distribution law of black-body
radiation,[9] known as Wien's_law in his honor. Ludwig Boltzmann independently
arrived at this result by considerations of Maxwell's_equations. However, it
was valid only at high frequencies and underestimated the radiance at low
frequencies. Later, Planck corrected this model using Boltzmann's statistical
interpretation of thermodynamics and proposed what is now called Planck's_law,
which led to the development of quantum mechanics.
Following Max_Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem
(reported 1859), Albert_Einstein offered a quantum-based theory to explain the
photoelectric_effect (1905, reported 1887). Around 1900â1910, the atomic
theory and the corpuscular_theory_of_light[10] first came to be widely accepted
as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of
matter and electromagnetic_radiation, respectively.
Among the first to study quantum phenomena in nature were Arthur_Compton, C._V.
Raman, and Pieter_Zeeman, each of whom has a quantum effect named after him.
Robert_Andrews_Millikan studied the photoelectric_effect experimentally, and
Albert Einstein developed a theory for it. At the same time, Ernest_Rutherford
experimentally discovered the nuclear model of the atom, for which Niels_Bohr
developed his theory of the atomic structure, which was later confirmed by the
experiments of Henry_Moseley. In 1913, Peter_Debye extended Niels Bohr's theory
of atomic structure, introducing elliptical_orbits, a concept also introduced
by Arnold_Sommerfeld.[11] This phase is known as old_quantum_theory.
According to Planck, each energy element (E)is proportional to its frequency
(Î½):
         E = h &#x03BD; &#xA0;   {\displaystyle E=h\nu \ }  [E=h\nu \ ],
Max_Planck is considered the father of the quantum theory.
where h is Planck's_constant.
Planck cautiously insisted that this was simply an aspect of the processes of
absorption and emission of radiation and had nothing to do with the physical
reality of the radiation itself.[12] In fact, he considered his quantum
hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable
discovery.[13] However, in 1905 Albert_Einstein interpreted Planck's quantum
hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric_effect, in
which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material.
He won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.
Einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic_wave such
as light could also be described as a particle (later called the photon), with
a discrete quantum of energy that was dependent on its frequency.[14]
The 1927 Solvay_Conference in Brussels
The foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of
the 20th century by Max_Planck, Niels_Bohr, Werner_Heisenberg, Louis_de
Broglie, Arthur_Compton, Albert_Einstein, Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger, Max_Born, John
von_Neumann, Paul_Dirac, Enrico_Fermi, Wolfgang_Pauli, Max_von_Laue, Freeman
Dyson, David_Hilbert, Wilhelm_Wien, Satyendra_Nath_Bose, Arnold_Sommerfeld, and
others. The Copenhagen_interpretation of Niels_Bohr became widely accepted.
In the mid-1920s, developments in quantum mechanics led to its becoming the
standard formulation for atomic physics. In the summer of 1925, Bohr and
Heisenberg published results that closed the old quantum theory. Out of
deference to their particle-like behavior in certain processes and
measurements, light quanta came to be called photons (1926). In 1926 Erwin
SchrÃ¶dinger suggested a partial differential equation for the wave functions
of particles like electrons. And when effectively restricted to a finite
region, this equation allowed only certain modes, corresponding to discrete
quantum states â whose properties turned out to be exactly the same as
implied by matrix mechanics.[15] From Einstein's simple postulation was born a
flurry of debating, theorizing, and testing. Thus, the entire field of quantum
physics emerged, leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay_Conference
in 1927.[citation_needed]
It was found that subatomic_particles and electromagnetic waves are neither
simply particle nor wave but have certain properties of each. This originated
the concept of waveâparticle_duality.[citation_needed]
By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the work
of David_Hilbert, Paul_Dirac and John_von_Neumann[16] with greater emphasis on
measurement, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and
philosophical_speculation_about_the_'observer'. It has since permeated many
disciplines, including quantum chemistry, quantum_electronics, quantum_optics,
and quantum_information_science. Its speculative modern developments include
string_theory and quantum_gravity theories. It also provides a useful framework
for many features of the modern periodic_table_of_elements, and describes the
behaviors of atoms during chemical_bonding and the flow of electrons in
computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern
technologies.[citation_needed]
While quantum mechanics was constructed to describe the world of the very
small, it is also needed to explain some macroscopic phenomena such as
superconductors,[17] and superfluids.[18]
The word quantum derives from the Latin, meaning "how great" or "how much".[19]
In quantum mechanics, it refers to a discrete unit assigned to certain physical
quantities such as the energy of an atom at rest (see Figure 1). The discovery
that particles are discrete packets of energy with wave-like properties led to
the branch of physics dealing with atomic and subatomic systems which is today
called quantum mechanics. It underlies the mathematical framework of many
fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed_matter_physics, solid-
state_physics, atomic_physics, molecular_physics, computational_physics,
computational_chemistry, quantum chemistry, particle_physics, nuclear
chemistry, and nuclear_physics.[20][better source needed] Some fundamental
aspects of the theory are still actively studied.[21]
Quantum mechanics is essential to understanding the behavior of systems at
atomic length scales and smaller. If the physical nature of an atom were solely
described by classical_mechanics, electrons would not orbit the nucleus, since
orbiting electrons emit radiation (due to circular_motion) and would quickly
collide with the nucleus due to this loss of energy. This framework was unable
to explain the stability of atoms. Instead, electrons remain in an uncertain,
non-deterministic, smeared, probabilistic waveâparticle orbital about the
nucleus, defying the traditional assumptions of classical mechanics and
electromagnetism.[22]
Quantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation and
description of the atom, especially the differences in the spectra of light
emitted by different isotopes of the same chemical_element, as well as
subatomic particles. In short, the quantum-mechanical atomic model has
succeeded spectacularly in the realm where classical mechanics and
electromagnetism falter.
Broadly speaking, quantum mechanics incorporates four classes of phenomena for
which classical physics cannot account:
    * quantization of certain_physical_properties
    * quantum_entanglement
    * principle_of_uncertainty
    * waveâparticle_duality
***** Mathematical formulations[edit] *****
Main article: Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics
See also: Quantum_logic
In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics developed by
Paul_Dirac,[23] David_Hilbert,[24] John_von_Neumann,[25] and Hermann_Weyl,[26]
the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are symbolized[27] as unit
vectors (called state vectors). Formally, these vectors are elements of a
complex separable Hilbert_space â variously called the state_space or the
associated Hilbert space of the system â that is well defined up to a complex
number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are
points in the projective_space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex
projective_space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the
system â for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the
space of square-integrable functions, while the state space for the spin of a
single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is
represented by a maximally Hermitian (precisely: by a self-adjoint) linear
operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable
corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue
corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the
operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can attain only those discrete
eigenvalues.
In the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is
described by a complex wave_function, also referred to as state vector in a
complex vector_space.[28] This abstract mathematical object allows for the
calculation of probabilities of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example,
it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular
region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical
mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of conjugate_variables,
such as position and momentum, to arbitrary precision. For instance, electrons
may be considered (to a certain probability) to be located somewhere within a
given region of space, but with their exact positions unknown. Contours of
constant probability density, often referred to as "clouds", may be drawn
around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be
located with the most probability. Heisenberg's uncertainty_principle
quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate
momentum.[29]
According to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement, the wave
function containing the probability information for a system collapses from a
given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a
measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable â
which explains the choice of Hermitian operators, for which all the eigenvalues
are real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be
found by computing the spectral_decomposition of the corresponding operator.
Heisenberg's uncertainty_principle is represented by the statement that the
operators corresponding to certain observables do not commute.
The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of
measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to
understand. It was the central topic in the famous BohrâEinstein_debates, in
which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by
way of thought_experiments. In the decades after the formulation of quantum
mechanics, the question of what constitutes a "measurement" has been
extensively studied. Newer interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics have been
formulated that do away with the concept of "wave_function_collapse" (see, for
example, the relative_state_interpretation). The basic idea is that when a
quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave
functions become entangled, so that the original quantum system ceases to exist
as an independent entity. For details, see the article on measurement_in
quantum_mechanics.[30]
Generally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values. Instead, it makes
a prediction using a probability_distribution; that is, it describes the
probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable.
Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability
clouds. Probability clouds are approximate (but better than the_Bohr_model)
whereby electron location is given by a probability_function, the wave_function
eigenvalue, such that the probability is the squared modulus of the complex
amplitude, or quantum_state nuclear attraction.[31][32] Naturally, these
probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the "instant" of the
measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value. There are, however,
certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular
observable. These are known as eigenstates of the observable ("eigen" can be
translated from German as meaning "inherent" or "characteristic").[33]
In the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything
(every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a
definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time
of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of
a particle's position and momentum (since they are conjugate_pairs) or its
energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs). Rather, it provides only
a range of probabilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and
momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to
describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values
(eigenstates).
Usually, a system will not be in an eigenstate of the observable (particle) we
are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wave function
will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or "generalized" eigenstate) of that
observable. This process is known as wave_function_collapse, a controversial
and much-debated process[34] that involves expanding the system under study to
include the measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at
the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability
of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates.
For example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave
function that is a wave_packet centered around some mean position x0 (neither
an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the position of
the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result.[30] It is
probable, but not certain, that it will be near x0, where the amplitude of the
wave function is large. After the measurement is performed, having obtained
some result x, the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered
at x.[35]
The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the SchrÃ¶dinger
equation, in which the Hamiltonian (the operator corresponding to the total
energy of the system) generates the time evolution. The time_evolution of wave
functions is deterministic in the sense that â given a wave function at an
initial time â it makes a definite prediction of what the wave function will
be at any later time.[36]
During a measurement, on the other hand, the change of the initial wave
function into another, later wave function is not deterministic, it is
unpredictable (i.e., random). A time-evolution simulation can be seen here.[37]
[38]
Wave functions change as time progresses. The SchrÃ¶dinger_equation describes
how wave functions change in time, playing a role similar to Newton's_second
law in classical_mechanics. The SchrÃ¶dinger equation, applied to the
aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave
packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical
particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also
spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more
uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate
(which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened
wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position
eigenstate.[39]

to higher probability density in a position measurement. Such wave functions
are directly comparable to Chladni's_figures of acoustic modes of vibration in
classical_physics, and are modes of oscillation as well, possessing a sharp
energy and, thus, a definite frequency. The angular_momentum and energy are
quantized, and take only discrete values like those shown (as is the case for
resonant_frequencies in acoustics)
Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant, or
independent of time â such as when in a stationary_state of constant energy,
time vanishes in the absolute square of the wave function. Many systems that
are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such "static"
wave functions. For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured
classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic
nucleus, whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by a static, spherically
symmetric wave function surrounding the nucleus (Fig._1) (note, however, that
only the lowest angular momentum states, labeled s, are spherically symmetric).
[40]
The SchrÃ¶dinger equation acts on the entire probability amplitude, not merely
its absolute value. Whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude
encodes information about probabilities, its phase encodes information about
the interference between quantum states. This gives rise to the "wave-like"
behavior of quantum states. As it turns out, analytic solutions of the
SchrÃ¶dinger equation are available for only a_very_small_number_of_relatively
simple_model_Hamiltonians, of which the quantum_harmonic_oscillator, the
particle_in_a_box, the dihydrogen_cation, and the hydrogen_atom are the most
important representatives. Even the helium atom â which contains just one
more electron than does the hydrogen atom â has defied all attempts at a
fully analytic treatment.
There exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions, however.
In the important method known as perturbation_theory, one uses the analytic
result for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate a result for a more
complicated model that is related to the simpler model by (for one example) the
addition of a weak potential_energy. Another method is the "semi-classical
equation of motion" approach, which applies to systems for which quantum
mechanics produces only weak (small) deviations from classical behavior. These
deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion. This approach is
particularly important in the field of quantum_chaos.
***** Mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics[edit] *****
There are numerous mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics.
One of the oldest and most commonly used formulations is the "transformation
theory" proposed by Paul_Dirac, which unifies and generalizes the two earliest
formulations of quantum mechanics â matrix_mechanics (invented by Werner
Heisenberg) and wave_mechanics (invented by Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger).[41]
Especially since Werner_Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel_Prize_in_Physics in
1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics, the role of Max_Born in the
development of QM was overlooked until the 1954 Nobel award. The role is noted
in a 2005 biography of Born, which recounts his role in the matrix formulation
of quantum mechanics, and the use of probability amplitudes. Heisenberg himself
acknowledges having learned matrices from Born, as published in a 1940
festschrift honoring Max_Planck.[42] In the matrix formulation, the
instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its
measurable properties, or "observables". Examples of observables include
energy, position, momentum, and angular_momentum. Observables can be either
continuous (e.g., the position of a particle) or discrete (e.g., the energy of
an electron bound to a hydrogen atom).[43] An alternative formulation of
quantum mechanics is Feynman's path_integral_formulation, in which a quantum-
mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over all possible classical and
non-classical paths between the initial and final states. This is the quantum-
mechanical counterpart of the action_principle in classical mechanics.
***** Interactions with other scientific theories[edit] *****
The rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state
space of a system is a Hilbert_space (crucially, that the space has an inner
product) and that observables of the system are Hermitian_operators acting on
vectors in that space â although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or
which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a
quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making
these choices is the correspondence_principle, which states that the
predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a
system moves to higher energies or, equivalently, larger quantum numbers, i.e.
whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems
incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high
energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero.
In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large
systems. This "high energy" limit is known as the classical or correspondence
limit. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular
system, then attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise
to the classical model in the correspondence limit.
                                 Unsolved problem in physics:
                                 In the correspondence_limit of quantum
                                 mechanics: Is there a preferred interpretation
                                 of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum
[Question, Web Fundamentals.svg] description of reality, which includes
                                 elements such as the "superposition of states"
                                 and "wave_function_collapse", give rise to the
                                 reality we perceive?
                                 (more_unsolved_problems_in_physics)
When quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models
whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical_mechanics. For
instance, the well-known model of the quantum_harmonic_oscillator uses an
explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic_energy of the
oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the classical_harmonic_oscillator.
Early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special_relativity involved the
replacement of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the
KleinâGordon_equation or the Dirac_equation. While these theories were
successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain
unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic
creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory
required the development of quantum_field_theory, which applies quantization to
a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum
field theory, quantum_electrodynamics, provides a fully quantum description of
the electromagnetic_interaction. The full apparatus of quantum field theory is
often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach,
one that has been employed since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to
treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a
classical electromagnetic_field. For example, the elementary quantum model of
the hydrogen_atom describes the electric_field of the hydrogen atom using a
classical      &#x2212;  e  2    /  ( 4 &#x03C0;  &#x03F5;     0     r )
{\displaystyle \textstyle -e^{2}/(4\pi \epsilon _{_{0}}r)}  [{\displaystyle
\textstyle -e^{2}/(4\pi \epsilon _{_{0}}r)}] Coulomb_potential. This "semi-
classical" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field
play an important role, such as in the emission of photons by charged
particles.
Quantum_field theories for the strong_nuclear_force and the weak_nuclear_force
have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force
is called quantum_chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear
particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak nuclear force and the
electromagnetic_force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single
quantum field theory (known as electroweak_theory), by the physicists Abdus
Salam, Sheldon_Glashow and Steven_Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel
Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.[44]
It has proven difficult to construct quantum models of gravity, the remaining
fundamental_force. Semi-classical approximations are workable, and have led to
predictions such as Hawking_radiation. However, the formulation of a complete
theory of quantum_gravity is hindered by apparent incompatibilities between
general_relativity (the most accurate theory of gravity currently known) and
some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory. The resolution of these
incompatibilities is an area of active research, and theories such as string
theory are among the possible candidates for a future theory of quantum
gravity.
Classical mechanics has also been extended into the complex_domain, with
complex classical mechanics exhibiting behaviors similar to quantum mechanics.
[45]
**** Quantum mechanics and classical physics[edit] ****
Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an
extremely high degree of accuracy.[46] According to the correspondence
principle between classical and quantum mechanics, all objects obey the laws of
quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics is just an approximation for large
systems of objects (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of
particles).[47] The laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of
quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or
large quantum_numbers.[48] However, chaotic_systems do not have good quantum
numbers, and quantum_chaos studies the relationship between classical and
quantum descriptions in these systems.
Quantum_coherence is an essential difference between classical and quantum
theories as illustrated by the EinsteinâPodolskyâRosen_(EPR)_paradox â an
attack on a certain philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics by an
appeal to local_realism.[49] Quantum_interference involves adding together
probability_amplitudes, whereas classical "waves" infer that there is an adding
together of intensities. For microscopic bodies, the extension of the system is
much smaller than the coherence_length, which gives rise to long-range
entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena characteristic of quantum systems.
[50] Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales, though
an exception to this rule may occur at extremely low temperatures (i.e.
approaching absolute_zero) at which quantum behavior may manifest itself
macroscopically.[51] This is in accordance with the following observations:
    * Many macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct
      consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts. For example, the
      stability of bulk matter (consisting of atoms and molecules which would
      quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids,
      and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of
      matter are all results of the interaction of electric_charges under the
      rules of quantum mechanics.[52]
    * While the seemingly "exotic" behavior of matter posited by quantum
      mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with
      particles of extremely small size or velocities approaching the speed_of
      light, the laws of classical, often considered "Newtonian", physics
      remain accurate in predicting the behavior of the vast majority of
      "large" objects (on the order of the size of large molecules or bigger)
      at velocities much smaller than the velocity_of_light.[53]
**** Copenhagen interpretation of quantum versus classical kinematics[edit]
****
A big difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that they use very
different kinematic descriptions.[54]
In Niels_Bohr's mature view, quantum mechanical phenomena are required to be
experiments, with complete descriptions of all the devices for the system,
preparative, intermediary, and finally measuring. The descriptions are in
macroscopic terms, expressed in ordinary language, supplemented with the
concepts of classical mechanics.[55][56][57][58] The initial condition and the
final condition of the system are respectively described by values in a
configuration space, for example a position space, or some equivalent space
such as a momentum space. Quantum mechanics does not admit a completely precise
description, in terms of both position and momentum, of an initial condition or
"state" (in the classical sense of the word) that would support a precisely
deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition.[59][60] In this
sense, advocated by Bohr in his mature writings, a quantum phenomenon is a
process, a passage from initial to final condition, not an instantaneous
"state" in the classical sense of that word.[61][62] Thus there are two kinds
of processes in quantum mechanics: stationary and transitional. For a
stationary process, the initial and final condition are the same. For a
transition, they are different. Obviously by definition, if only the initial
condition is given, the process is not determined.[59] Given its initial
condition, prediction of its final condition is possible, causally but only
probabilistically, because the SchrÃ¶dinger equation is deterministic for wave
function evolution, but the wave function describes the system only
probabilistically.[63][64]
For many experiments, it is possible to think of the initial and final
conditions of the system as being a particle. In some cases it appears that
there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by
which a particle might pass from initial to final condition. It is an important
feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique
definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed. Only the
initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing
paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration
space description or its equivalent. In every case for which a quantum
kinematic description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this
restriction of kinematic precision. An example of such a reason is that for a
particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held
motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it
must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.[65][66]
Classical kinematics does not primarily demand experimental description of its
phenomena. It allows completely precise description of an instantaneous state
by a value in phase space, the Cartesian product of configuration and momentum
spaces. This description simply assumes or imagines a state as a physically
existing entity without concern about its experimental measurability. Such a
description of an initial condition, together with Newton's laws of motion,
allows a precise deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition, with
a definite trajectory of passage. Hamiltonian dynamics can be used for this.
Classical kinematics also allows the description of a process analogous to the
initial and final condition description used by quantum mechanics. Lagrangian
mechanics applies to this.[67] For processes that need account to be taken of
actions of a small number of Planck_constants, classical kinematics is not
adequate; quantum mechanics is needed.
**** General relativity and quantum mechanics[edit] ****
Even with the defining postulates of both Einstein's theory of general
relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and
repeated empirical_evidence, and while they do not directly contradict each
other theoretically (at least with regard to their primary claims), they have
proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent, cohesive model.
[68]
Gravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification
between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in
those particular applications. However, the lack of a correct theory of quantum
gravity is an important issue in physical_cosmology and the search by
physicists for an elegant "Theory_of_Everything" (TOE). Consequently, resolving
the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and
21st-century physics. Many prominent physicists, including Stephen_Hawking,
have labored for many years in the attempt to discover a theory underlying
everything. This TOE would combine not only the different models of subatomic
physics, but also derive the four fundamental_forces_of_nature â the strong
force, electromagnetism, the weak_force, and gravity â from a single force or
phenomenon. While Stephen Hawking was initially a believer in the Theory of
Everything, after considering GÃ¶del's_Incompleteness_Theorem, he has concluded
that one is not obtainable, and has stated so publicly in his lecture "GÃ¶del
and the End of Physics" (2002).[69]
**** Attempts at a unified field theory[edit] ****
Main article: Grand_unified_theory
The quest to unify the fundamental_forces through quantum mechanics is still
ongoing. Quantum_electrodynamics (or "quantum electromagnetism"), which is
currently (in the perturbative regime at least) the most accurately tested
physical theory in competition with general relativity,[70][71] has been
successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electroweak_force and
work is currently being done to merge the electroweak and strong force into the
electrostrong_force. Current predictions state that at around 1014 GeV the
three aforementioned forces are fused into a single unified field.[72] Beyond
this "grand unification", it is speculated that it may be possible to merge
gravity with the other three gauge symmetries, expected to occur at roughly
1019 GeV. However  â and while special relativity is parsimoniously
incorporated into quantum electrodynamics  â the expanded general_relativity,
currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully
incorporated into quantum theory. One of those searching for a coherent TOE is
Edward_Witten, a theoretical physicist who formulated the M-theory, which is an
attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based string_theory. M-theory posits
that our apparent 4-dimensional_spacetime is, in reality, actually an 11-
dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension,
although 7 of the spatial dimensions are â at lower energies â completely
"compactified" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement
or probing.
Another popular theory is Loop_quantum_gravity (LQG), a theory first proposed
by Carlo_Rovelli that describes the quantum properties of gravity. It is also a
theory of quantum_space and quantum_time, because in general relativity the
geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of gravity. LQG is an attempt to merge
and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general_relativity. The main
output of the theory is a physical picture of space where space is granular.
The granularity is a direct consequence of the quantization. It has the same
nature of the granularity of the photons in the quantum theory of
electromagnetism or the discrete levels of the energy of the atoms. But here it
is space itself which is discrete. More precisely, space can be viewed as an
extremely fine fabric or network "woven" of finite loops. These networks of
loops are called spin_networks. The evolution of a spin network over time is
called a spin foam. The predicted size of this structure is the Planck_length,
which is approximately 1.616Ã10â35 m. According to theory, there is no
meaning to length shorter than this (cf. Planck_scale energy). Therefore, LQG
predicts that not just matter, but also space itself, has an atomic structure.
***** Philosophical implications[edit] *****
Main article: Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics
Since its inception, the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum
mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations.
Even fundamental issues, such as Max_Born's basic rules concerning probability
amplitudes and probability_distributions, took decades to be appreciated by
society and many leading scientists. Richard_Feynman once said, "I think I can
safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."[73] According to Steven
Weinberg, "There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation
of quantum mechanics."[74]
The Copenhagen_interpretation â due largely to Niels Bohr and Werner
Heisenberg â remains most widely accepted amongst physicists, some 75 years
after its enunciation. According to this interpretation, the probabilistic
nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be
replaced by a deterministic theory, but instead must be considered a final
renunciation of the classical idea of "causality." It is also believed therein
that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must
always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the conjugate
nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.
Albert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, did not accept
some of the more philosophical or metaphysical interpretations of quantum
mechanics, such as rejection of determinism and of causality. He is famously
quoted as saying, in response to this aspect, "God does not play with dice".
[75] He rejected the concept that the state of a physical system depends on the
experimental arrangement for its measurement. He held that a state of nature
occurs in its own right, regardless of whether or how it might be observed. In
that view, he is supported by the currently accepted definition of a quantum
state, which remains invariant under arbitrary choice of configuration space
for its representation, that is to say, manner of observation. He also held
that underlying quantum mechanics there should be a theory that thoroughly and
directly expresses the rule against action_at_a_distance; in other words, he
insisted on the principle_of_locality. He considered, but rejected on
theoretical grounds, a particular proposal for hidden variables to obviate the
indeterminism or acausality of quantum mechanical measurement. He considered
that quantum mechanics was a currently valid but not a permanently definitive
theory for quantum phenomena. He thought its future replacement would require
profound conceptual advances, and would not come quickly or easily. The Bohr-
Einstein_debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation
from an epistemological point of view. In arguing for his views, he produced a
series of objections, the most famous of which has become known as the
EinsteinâPodolskyâRosen_paradox.
John_Bell showed that this EPR_paradox led to experimentally_testable
differences between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added hidden
variables. Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum
mechanics, thereby demonstrating that quantum mechanics cannot be improved upon
by addition of hidden variables.[76] Alain Aspect's initial experiments in
1982, and many subsequent experiments since, have definitively verified quantum
entanglement. By the early 1980s, experiments had shown that such inequalities
were indeed violated in practice â so that there were in fact correlations of
the kind suggested by quantum mechanics. At first these just seemed like
isolated esoteric effects, but by the mid-1990s, they were being codified in
the field of quantum information theory, and led to constructions with names
like quantum_cryptography and quantum_teleportation.[77]
Entanglement, as demonstrated in Bell-type experiments, does not, however,
violate causality, since no transfer of information happens. Quantum
entanglement forms the basis of quantum_cryptography, which is proposed for use
in high-security commercial applications in banking and government.
The Everett_many-worlds_interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that all the
possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse
composed of mostly independent parallel universes.[78] This is not accomplished
by introducing some "new axiom" to quantum mechanics, but on the contrary, by
removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet. All of the possible
consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus (including
the observer) are present in a real physical â not just formally
mathematical, as in other interpretations â quantum_superposition. Such a
superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called
an entangled_state. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-
deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can only observe
the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned
superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is
perfectly consistent with John_Bell's experiments and makes them intuitively
understandable. However, according to the theory of quantum_decoherence, these
"parallel universes" will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be
understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes
entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number of other
particles, some of which are photons flying away at the speed_of_light towards
the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the wave function did not
collapse, one would have to bring all these particles back and measure them
again, together with the system that was originally measured. Not only is this
completely impractical, but even if one could theoretically do this, it would
have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place
(including the physicist's memory). In light of these Bell_tests, Cramer (1986)
formulated his transactional_interpretation[79] which is unique in providing a
physical explanation for the Born_rule.[80] Relational_quantum_mechanics
appeared in the late 1990s as the modern derivative of the Copenhagen
Interpretation.
***** Applications[edit] *****
Quantum mechanics has had enormous[81] success in explaining many of the
features of our universe. Quantum mechanics is often the only theory that can
reveal the individual behaviors of the subatomic_particles that make up all
forms of matter (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and others). Quantum
mechanics has strongly influenced string_theories, candidates for a Theory_of
Everything (see reductionism).
Quantum mechanics is also critically important for understanding how individual
atoms are joined by covalent bond to form molecules. The application of quantum
mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry. Quantum mechanics can
also provide quantitative insight into ionic and covalent_bonding processes by
explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others
and the magnitudes of the energies involved.[82] Furthermore, most of the
calculations performed in modern computational_chemistry rely on quantum
mechanics.
In many aspects modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are
significant.
**** Electronics[edit] ****
Many modern electronic devices are designed using quantum mechanics. Examples
include the laser, the transistor (and thus the microchip), the electron
microscope, and magnetic_resonance_imaging (MRI). The study of semiconductors
led to the invention of the diode and the transistor, which are indispensable
parts of modern electronics systems, computer and telecommunication devices.
Another application is for making laser diode and light_emitting_diode which
are a high-efficiency source of light.
A working mechanism of a resonant_tunneling_diode device, based on the
phenomenon of quantum_tunneling through potential_barriers. (Left: band
diagram; Center: transmission_coefficient; Right: current-voltage
characteristics) As shown in the band diagram(left), although there are two
barriers, electrons still tunnel through via the confined states between two
barriers(center), conducting current.
Many electronic devices operate under effect of quantum_tunneling. It even
exists in the simple light_switch. The switch would not work if electrons could
not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact
surfaces. Flash_memory chips found in USB_drives use quantum tunneling to erase
their memory cells. Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize
quantum tunneling effect, such as resonant_tunneling_diode. Unlike classical
diodes, its current is carried by resonant_tunneling through two or more
potential_barriers (see right figure). Its negative resistance behavior can
only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to
Fermi_level, tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases.
Quantum mechanics is necessary to understanding and designing such electronic
devices.
**** Cryptography[edit] ****
Researchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating
quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop quantum
cryptography, which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of
information.
An inherent advantage yielded by quantum cryptography when compared to
classical cryptography is the detection of passive eavesdropping. This is a
natural result of the behavior of quantum bits; due to the observer_effect, if
a bit in a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state
would collapse into an eigenstate. Because the intended recipient was expecting
to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would know
there was an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a
superposition.[83]
**** Quantum computing[edit] ****
Another goal is the development of quantum_computers, which are expected to
perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical
computers. Instead of using classical bits, quantum computers use qubits, which
can be in superpositions of states. Quantum programmers are able to manipulate
the superposition of qubits in order to solve problems that classical computing
cannot do effectively, such as searching unsorted databases or integer
factorization. IBM claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the
fields of medicine, logistics, financial services, artificial_intelligence and
cloud security.[84]
Another active research topic is quantum_teleportation, which deals with
techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.
**** Macroscale quantum effects[edit] ****
While quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of
matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum_mechanical_effects on a large
scale. Superfluidity, the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near
absolute_zero, is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon
of superconductivity, the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting
material (an electric_current) at sufficiently low temperatures. The fractional
quantum_Hall_effect is a topological_ordered state which corresponds to
patterns of long-range quantum_entanglement.[85] States with different
topological orders (or different patterns of long range entanglements) cannot
change into each other without a phase transition.
**** Quantum theory[edit] ****
Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously
unexplained phenomena, such as black-body_radiation and the stability of the
orbitals of electrons in atoms. It has also given insight into the workings of
many different biological_systems, including smell_receptors and protein
structures.[86] Recent work on photosynthesis has provided evidence that
quantum correlations play an essential role in this fundamental process of
plants and many other organisms.[87] Even so, classical_physics can often
provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics,
typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum
numbers. Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than
quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the
system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics
insignificant.
***** Examples[edit] *****
**** Free particle[edit] ****
For example, consider a free_particle. In quantum mechanics, a free matter is
described by a wave function. The particle properties of the matter become
apparent when we measure its position and velocity. The wave properties of the
matter become apparent when we measure its wave properties like interference.
The waveâparticle_duality feature is incorporated in the relations of
coordinates and operators in the formulation of quantum mechanics. Since the
matter is free (not subject to any interactions), its quantum state can be
represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave
function. The position and momentum of the particle are observables. The
Uncertainty_Principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot
simultaneously be measured with complete precision. However, one can measure
the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of
position with a wave function that is very large (a Dirac_delta) at a
particular position x, and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position
measurement on such a wave function, the resultant x will be obtained with 100%
probability (i.e., with full certainty, or complete precision). This is called
an eigenstate of position â or, stated in mathematical terms, a generalized
position eigenstate (eigendistribution). If the particle is in an eigenstate of
position, then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the
particle is in an eigenstate of momentum, then its position is completely
unknown.[88] In an eigenstate of momentum having a plane_wave form, it can be
shown that the wavelength is equal to h/p, where h is Planck's_constant and p
is the momentum of the eigenstate.[89]
**** Particle in a box[edit] ****
1-dimensional potential energy box (or infinite potential well)
Main article: Particle_in_a_box
The particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most
mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of
energy levels. The box is defined as having zero potential energy everywhere
inside a certain region, and therefore infinite potential energy everywhere
outside that region. For the one-dimensional case in the     x   {\displaystyle
x}  [x] direction, the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation may be written
[90]
         &#x2212;    &#x210F;  2    2 m        d  2   &#x03C8;   d  x  2      =
      E &#x03C8; .   {\displaystyle -{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}{\frac {d^{2}\psi
      }{dx^{2}}}=E\psi .}  [-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}{\frac {d^{2}\psi }{dx^
      {2}}}=E\psi .]
With the differential operator defined by
             p &#x005E;     x   = &#x2212; i &#x210F;   d  d x
      {\displaystyle {\hat {p}}_{x}=-i\hbar {\frac {d}{dx}}}  [{\hat {p}}_{x}=-
      i\hbar {\frac {d}{dx}}]
the previous equation is evocative of the classic_kinetic_energy_analogue,
           1  2 m        p &#x005E;     x   2   = E ,   {\displaystyle {\frac
      {1}{2m}}{\hat {p}}_{x}^{2}=E,}  [{\frac {1}{2m}}{\hat {p}}_{x}^{2}=E,]
with state     &#x03C8;   {\displaystyle \psi }  [\psi ] in this case having
energy     E   {\displaystyle E}  [E] coincident with the kinetic energy of the
particle.
The general solutions of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the particle in a box
are
         &#x03C8; ( x ) = A  e  i k x   + B  e  &#x2212; i k x     E =
      &#x210F;  2    k  2     2 m      {\displaystyle \psi (x)=Ae^{ikx}+Be^{-
      ikx}\qquad \qquad E={\frac {\hbar ^{2}k^{2}}{2m}}}  [\psi (x)=Ae^
      {ikx}+Be^{-ikx}\qquad \qquad E={\frac {\hbar ^{2}k^{2}}{2m}}]
or, from Euler's_formula,
         &#x03C8; ( x ) = C sin &#x2061; k x + D cos &#x2061; k x .
      {\displaystyle \psi (x)=C\sin kx+D\cos kx.\!}  [\psi (x)=C\sin kx+D\cos
      kx.\!]
The infinite potential walls of the box determine the values of C, D, and k at
x = 0 and x = L where Ï must be zero. Thus, at x = 0,
         &#x03C8; ( 0 ) = 0 = C sin &#x2061; 0 + D cos &#x2061; 0 = D
      {\displaystyle \psi (0)=0=C\sin 0+D\cos 0=D\!}  [\psi (0)=0=C\sin 0+D\cos
      0=D\!]
and D = 0. At x = L,
         &#x03C8; ( L ) = 0 = C sin &#x2061; k L .    {\displaystyle \psi
      (L)=0=C\sin kL.\!}  [\psi (L)=0=C\sin kL.\!]
in which C cannot be zero as this would conflict with the Born interpretation.
Therefore, since sin(kL) = 0, kL must be an integer multiple of Ï,
         k =    n &#x03C0;  L     n = 1 , 2 , 3 , &#x2026; .   {\displaystyle
      k={\frac {n\pi }{L}}\qquad \qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots .}  [k={\frac {n\pi }
      {L}}\qquad \qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots .]
The quantization of energy levels follows from this constraint on k, since
         E =     &#x210F;  2    &#x03C0;  2    n  2     2 m  L  2      =     n
      2    h  2     8 m  L  2      .   {\displaystyle E={\frac {\hbar ^{2}\pi ^
      {2}n^{2}}{2mL^{2}}}={\frac {n^{2}h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}}.}  [E={\frac {\hbar ^
      {2}\pi ^{2}n^{2}}{2mL^{2}}}={\frac {n^{2}h^{2}}{8mL^{2}}}.]
      The ground state energy of the particles is E1 for n=1.
      Energy of particle in the nth state is En =n2E1, n=2,3,4,.....
      Particle in a box with boundary condition V(x)=0 -a/2<x<+a/2
      A particle in a box with a little change in the boundary condition.
      In this condition the general solution will be same, there will a little
      change to the final result, since the boundary conditions are changed
         &#x03C8; ( x ) = C sin &#x2061; k x + D cos &#x2061; k x .
      {\displaystyle \psi (x)=C\sin kx+D\cos kx.\!}  [\psi (x)=C\sin kx+D\cos
      kx.\!]
      At x=0, the wave function is not actually zero at all value of n.
      Clearly, from the wave function variation graph we have,
      At n=1,3,4,...... the wave function follows a cosine curve with x=0 as
      origin
      At n=2,4,6,...... the wave function follows a sine curve with x=0 as
      origin
      [Variation_of_wave_function_with_x_and_n.]
      Wave Function Variation with x and n.
      From this observation we can conclude that the wave function is
      alternatively sine and cosine.
      So in this case the resultant wave equation is
      Ïn(x) = Acos(knx) n=1,3,5,.............
      = Bsin(knx) n=2,4,6,.............
**** Finite potential well[edit] ****
Main article: Finite_potential_well
A finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential well
problem to potential wells having finite depth.
The finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the
infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero
at the walls of the well. Instead, the wave function must satisfy more
complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions
outside the well.
**** Rectangular potential barrier[edit] ****
Main article: Rectangular_potential_barrier
This is a model for the quantum_tunneling effect which plays an important role
in the performance of modern technologies such as flash_memory and scanning
tunneling_microscopy. Quantum tunneling is central to physical phenomena
involved in superlattices.
**** Harmonic oscillator[edit] ****
Main article: Quantum_harmonic_oscillator
Some trajectories of a harmonic_oscillator (i.e. a ball attached to a spring)
in classical_mechanics (A-B) and quantum mechanics (C-H). In quantum mechanics,
the position of the ball is represented by a wave (called the wave_function),
with the real_part shown in blue and the imaginary_part shown in red. Some of
the trajectories (such as C, D, E, and F) are standing_waves (or "stationary
states"). Each standing-wave frequency is proportional to a possible energy
level of the oscillator. This "energy quantization" does not occur in classical
physics, where the oscillator can have any energy.
As in the classical case, the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is
given by
         V ( x ) =   1 2   m  &#x03C9;  2    x  2   .   {\displaystyle V(x)=
      {\frac {1}{2}}m\omega ^{2}x^{2}.}  [{\displaystyle V(x)={\frac {1}
      {2}}m\omega ^{2}x^{2}.}]
This problem can either be treated by directly solving the SchrÃ¶dinger
equation, which is not trivial, or by using the more elegant "ladder method"
first proposed by Paul Dirac. The eigenstates are given by
          &#x03C8;  n   ( x ) =    1   2  n    n !     &#x22C5;   (    m
      &#x03C9;   &#x03C0; &#x210F;    )   1  /  4   &#x22C5;  e  &#x2212;    m
      &#x03C9;  x  2     2 &#x210F;      &#x22C5;  H  n    (      m &#x03C9;
      &#x210F;    x  )  ,    {\displaystyle \psi _{n}(x)={\sqrt {\frac {1}{2^
      {n}\,n!}}}\cdot \left({\frac {m\omega }{\pi \hbar }}\right)^{1/4}\cdot e^
      {-{\frac {m\omega x^{2}}{2\hbar }}}\cdot H_{n}\left({\sqrt {\frac
      {m\omega }{\hbar }}}x\right),\qquad }  [{\displaystyle \psi _{n}(x)=
      {\sqrt {\frac {1}{2^{n}\,n!}}}\cdot \left({\frac {m\omega }{\pi \hbar
      }}\right)^{1/4}\cdot e^{-{\frac {m\omega x^{2}}{2\hbar }}}\cdot H_
      {n}\left({\sqrt {\frac {m\omega }{\hbar }}}x\right),\qquad }]
         n = 0 , 1 , 2 , &#x2026; .   {\displaystyle n=0,1,2,\ldots .}  [
      {\displaystyle n=0,1,2,\ldots .}]
where Hn are the Hermite_polynomials
          H  n   ( x ) = ( &#x2212; 1  )  n    e   x  2        d  n    d  x  n
      (  e  &#x2212;  x  2     )  ,   {\displaystyle H_{n}(x)=(-1)^{n}e^{x^{2}}
      {\frac {d^{n}}{dx^{n}}}\left(e^{-x^{2}}\right),}  [{\displaystyle H_{n}
      (x)=(-1)^{n}e^{x^{2}}{\frac {d^{n}}{dx^{n}}}\left(e^{-x^{2}}\right),}]
and the corresponding energy levels are
          E  n   = &#x210F; &#x03C9;  (  n +   1 2    )  .   {\displaystyle E_
      {n}=\hbar \omega \left(n+{1 \over 2}\right).}  [{\displaystyle E_
      {n}=\hbar \omega \left(n+{1 \over 2}\right).}]
This is another example illustrating the quantification of energy for bound
states.
**** Step potential[edit] ****
Main article: Solution_of_SchrÃ¶dinger_equation_for_a_step_potential
Scattering at a finite potential step of height V0, shown in green. The
amplitudes and direction of left- and right-moving waves are indicated. Yellow
is the incident wave, blue are reflected and transmitted waves, red does not
occur. E > V0 for this figure.
The potential in this case is given by:
         V ( x ) =   {    0 ,   x < 0 ,      V  0   ,   x &#x2265; 0.
      {\displaystyle V(x)={\begin{cases}0,&x<0,\\V_{0},&x\geq 0.\end{cases}}}
      [V(x)={\begin{cases}0,&x<0,\\V_{0},&x\geq 0.\end{cases}}]
The solutions are superpositions of left- and right-moving waves:
          &#x03C8;  1   ( x ) =   1   k  1       (   A  &#x2192;    e  i  k  1
      x   +  A  &#x2190;    e  &#x2212; i  k  1   x    )   x < 0
      {\displaystyle \psi _{1}(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {k_{1}}}}\left(A_
      {\rightarrow }e^{ik_{1}x}+A_{\leftarrow }e^{-ik_{1}x}\right)\qquad x<0}
      [{\displaystyle \psi _{1}(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {k_{1}}}}\left(A_
      {\rightarrow }e^{ik_{1}x}+A_{\leftarrow }e^{-ik_{1}x}\right)\qquad x<0}]
and
          &#x03C8;  2   ( x ) =   1   k  2       (   B  &#x2192;    e  i  k  2
      x   +  B  &#x2190;    e  &#x2212; i  k  2   x    )   x > 0
      {\displaystyle \psi _{2}(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {k_{2}}}}\left(B_
      {\rightarrow }e^{ik_{2}x}+B_{\leftarrow }e^{-ik_{2}x}\right)\qquad x>0}
      [{\displaystyle \psi _{2}(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {k_{2}}}}\left(B_
      {\rightarrow }e^{ik_{2}x}+B_{\leftarrow }e^{-ik_{2}x}\right)\qquad x>0}],
with coefficients A and B determined from the boundary_conditions and by
imposing a continuous derivative on the solution, and where the wave_vectors
are related to the energy via
          k  1   =   2 m E  /   &#x210F;  2       {\displaystyle k_{1}={\sqrt
      {2mE/\hbar ^{2}}}}  [k_{1}={\sqrt {2mE/\hbar ^{2}}}]
and
          k  2   =   2 m ( E &#x2212;  V  0   )  /   &#x210F;  2
      {\displaystyle k_{2}={\sqrt {2m(E-V_{0})/\hbar ^{2}}}}  [k_{2}={\sqrt {2m
      (E-V_{0})/\hbar ^{2}}}].
Each term of the solution can be interpreted as an incident, reflected, or
transmitted component of the wave, allowing the calculation of transmission and
reflection coefficients. Notably, in contrast to classical mechanics, incident
particles with energies greater than the potential step are partially
reflected.

      performed having a bearing on the question, and enquire what will be the

      of measurements in quantum theory is thus the emphasis on the necessity,
      in the account of the phenomena, of taking the whole experimental
      arrangement into consideration, in complete conformity with the fact that
      all unambiguous interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism
      involves the fixation of the external conditions, defining the initial
      state of the atomic system and the character of the possible predictions
      as regards subsequent observable properties of that system. Any
      measurement in quantum theory can in fact only refer either to a fixation
      of the initial state or to the test of such predictions, and it is first
      the combination of both kinds which constitutes a well-defined
      phenomenon."
