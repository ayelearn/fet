The relationship between the stress and strain that a particular material
displays is known as that particular material's stressâstrain curve. It is
unique for each material and is found by recording the amount of deformation
(strain) at distinct intervals of a variety of loadings (stress). These curves
reveal many of the properties of a material (including data to establish the
Modulus_of_Elasticity, E).[1]

Generally speaking, curves representing the relationship between stress and
strain in any form of deformation can be regarded as stress-strain curves. The
stress and strain can be normal, shear, or mixture, also can be uniaxial,
biaxial, or multiaxial, even change with time. The form of deformation can be
compression, stretching, torsion, rotation, and so on. If not mentioned
otherwise, stressâstrain curve refers to the relationship between axial
normal stress and axial normal strain of materials measured in a tension test.
Consider a bar of original cross sectional area A being subjected to equal and
opposite forces F pulling at the ends so the bar is under tension. The material
is experiencing a stress defined to be the ratio of the force to the cross
sectional area of the bar, as well as an axial elongation:
          &#x03C3;  =    F  A  0        {\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma } =
      {\tfrac {F}{A_{0}}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma } ={\tfrac {F}{A_
      {0}}}}]
          &#x03F5;  =     L &#x2212;  L  0     L  0      =     &#x0394; L   L
      0        {\displaystyle \mathrm {\epsilon } ={\tfrac {L-L_{0}}{L_{0}}}=
      {\tfrac {\Delta L}{L_{0}}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\epsilon } ={\tfrac
      {L-L_{0}}{L_{0}}}={\tfrac {\Delta L}{L_{0}}}}]
Subscript 0 denotes the original dimensions of the sample. The SI unit for
stress is newton per square metre, or pascal (1 pascal = 1 Pa = 1 N/m2), and
for strain is "1". Stress-strain curve for this material is plotted by
elongating the sample and recording the stress variation with strain till the
sample fractures. By convention, the strain is set to the horizontal axis and
stress is set to vertical axis. Note that for engineering purposes we often
assume the cross-section area of the material does not change during the whole
deformation process. This is not true since the actual area will decrease while
deforming due to elastic and plastic deformation. The curve assuming the cross-
section area is fixed is called the âengineering stress-strain curveâ,
while the curve based on the actual cross-section area is the âtrue stress-
strain curveâ. If not mentioned otherwise, the relationship between true
stress-strain curve and engineering stress-strain curve will be discussed
later.

***** Stages[edit] *****
Fig.2 The schematic diagram for stress-strain curve of low carbon steel
A schematic diagram for the stress-strain curve of low carbon steel at room
temperature is shown in figure 2. There are several stages showing different
behaviors, which suggests different mechanical properties. To clarify,
materials can miss one or more stages shown in figure 2, or have totally
different stages.

The first stage is the linear_elastic region. The stress is proportional to the
strain, that is, obeys the general_Hooke's_law, and the slope is Young's
modulus. In this region, the material undergoes only elastic deformation. The
end of the stage is the initiation point of plastic deformation. The stress
component of this point is defined as yield_strength (or upper yield point, UYP
for short).

The second stage is the strain hardening region. This region starts as the
strain goes beyond yielding point, and ends at the ultimate strength point,
which is the maximal stress shown in the stress-strain curve (tensile_strength,
T.S., also sometimes referred to as the ultimate tensile strength, D.T.S.). In
this region, the stress mainly increases as material elongates, except that
there is a nearly flat region at the beginning. The stress of the flat region
is defined as the lower yield point (LYP) and results from the formation and
propagation of LÃ¼ders_bands. Explicitly, heterogeneous plastic deformation
forms bands at the upper yield strength and these bands carrying with
deformation spread along the sample at the lower yield strength. After the
sample is again uniformly deformed, the increase of stress with the progress of
extension results from work strengthening, that is, dense dislocations induced
by plastic deformation hampers the further motion of dislocations. To overcome
these obstacles, a higher resolved_shear_stress should be applied. As the
strain accumulates, work strengthening gets reinforced, till the stress reaches
the tensile strength.

The third stage is the necking region. Beyond tensile strength, a neck forms
where the local cross-sectional area becomes significantly smaller than the
average. The necking deformation is heterogenous and will reinforce itself as
the stress concentrates more at small section. Such positive feedback leads to
quick development of necking and leads to fracture. Note that though the
pulling force is decreasing, the work strengthening is still progressing, that
is, the true stress keeps growing but the engineering stress decreases because
the shrinking section area is not considered. This region ends up with the
fracture. After fracture, percent elongation and reduction in section area can
be calculated.

***** Relationship with true stress and strain[edit] *****
Due to the shrinking of section area and the ignored effect of developed
elongation to further elongation, true stress and strain are different from
engineering stress and strain.
Fig.3 The difference between true stress-strain curve and engineering stress-
strain curve
           &#x03C3;  t    =    F A      {\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma _{t}} =
      {\tfrac {F}{A}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma _{t}} ={\tfrac {F}
      {A}}}]
           &#x03F5;  t    = &#x222B;     &#x03B4; L  L      {\displaystyle
      \mathrm {\epsilon _{t}} =\int {\tfrac {\delta L}{L}}}  [{\displaystyle
      \mathrm {\epsilon _{t}} =\int {\tfrac {\delta L}{L}}}]
Here the dimensions are instant values. Assuming volume of the sample conserves
and deformation happens uniformly,
    A  0    L  0   = A L   {\displaystyle A_{0}L_{0}=AL}  [{\displaystyle A_
{0}L_{0}=AL}]
The true stress and strain can be expressed by engineering stress and strain.
For true stress,
     &#x03C3;  t    =    F A    =    F  A  0      &#x2217;     A  0   A    =
F  A  0      &#x2217;    L  L  0      = &#x03C3; ( 1 + &#x03F5; )
{\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma _{t}} ={\tfrac {F}{A}}={\tfrac {F}{A_{0}}}*
{\tfrac {A_{0}}{A}}={\tfrac {F}{A_{0}}}*{\tfrac {L}{L_{0}}}=\sigma (1+\epsilon
)}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma _{t}} ={\tfrac {F}{A}}={\tfrac {F}{A_{0}}}*
{\tfrac {A_{0}}{A}}={\tfrac {F}{A_{0}}}*{\tfrac {L}{L_{0}}}=\sigma (1+\epsilon
)}]
For the strain,
    &#x03B4;  &#x03F5;  t    =     &#x03B4; L  L      {\displaystyle \mathrm
{\delta \epsilon _{t}} ={\tfrac {\delta L}{L}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm
{\delta \epsilon _{t}} ={\tfrac {\delta L}{L}}}]
Integrate both sides and apply the boundary condition,
     &#x03F5;  t    = l n (    L  L  0      ) = l n ( 1 + &#x03F5; )
{\displaystyle \mathrm {\epsilon _{t}} =ln({\tfrac {L}{L_{0}}})=ln(1+\epsilon
)}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\epsilon _{t}} =ln({\tfrac {L}{L_{0}}})=ln
(1+\epsilon )}]
So in a tension test, true stress is larger than engineering stress and true
strain is less than engineering strain. Thus, a point defining true stress-
strain curve is displaced upwards and to the left to define the equivalent
engineering stress-strain curve. The difference between the true and
engineering stresses and strains will increase with plastic deformation. At low
strains (such as elastic deformation), the differences between the two is
negligible. As for the tensile strength point, it is the maximal point in
engineering stress-strain curve but is not a special point in ture stress-
strain curve. Because engineering stress is proportional to the force applied
along the sample, the criterion for necking formation can be set as
&#x03B4;   F    = 0   {\displaystyle \mathrm {\delta {\textit {F}}} =0}  [
{\displaystyle \mathrm {\delta {\textit {F}}} =0}].
    &#x03B4;   F    = 0 =  &#x03C3;  t   &#x03B4; A + A &#x03B4;  &#x03C3;  t
{\displaystyle \mathrm {\delta {\textit {F}}} =0=\sigma _{t}\delta A+A\delta
\sigma _{t}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\delta {\textit {F}}} =0=\sigma _
{t}\delta A+A\delta \sigma _{t}}]
    &#x2212;     &#x03B4; A  A     =     &#x03B4;  &#x03C3;  t     &#x03C3;  t
{\displaystyle \mathrm {-{\tfrac {\delta A}{A}}} =\mathrm {\tfrac {\delta
\sigma _{t}}{\sigma _{t}}} }  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {-{\tfrac {\delta A}{A}}}
=\mathrm {\tfrac {\delta \sigma _{t}}{\sigma _{t}}} }]
This analysis suggests nature of the UTS point. The work strengthening effect
is exactly balanced by the shrinking of section area at UTS point.
After the formation of necking, the sample undergoes heterogeneous deformation,
so equations above are not valid. The stress and strain at the necking can be
expressed as:
           &#x03C3;  t    =    F  A  n e c k        {\displaystyle \mathrm
      {\sigma _{t}} ={\tfrac {F}{A_{neck}}}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma _
      {t}} ={\tfrac {F}{A_{neck}}}}]
           &#x03F5;  t    = l n (     A  0    A  n e c k      )
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {\epsilon _{t}} =ln({\tfrac {A_{0}}{A_{neck}}})}
      [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\epsilon _{t}} =ln({\tfrac {A_{0}}{A_{neck}}})}]
An empirical equation is commonly used to describe the relationship between
true stress and strain.
     &#x03C3;  t    = K (  &#x03F5;  t    )  n     {\displaystyle \mathrm
{\sigma _{t}} =K(\epsilon _{t})^{n}}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma _{t}} =K
(\epsilon _{t})^{n}}]
Here, n is strain-hardening coefficient and K is the strength coefficient. n is
a measure of material' work hardening behavior. Materials with a higher n has a
greater resistance to necking. Typically, metals at room temperature has n
ranging from 0.02 to 0.5.[2]
***** Classification[edit] *****
It is possible to distinguish some common characteristics among the
stressâstrain curves of various groups of materials and, on this basis, to
divide materials into two broad categories; namely, the ductile materials and
the brittle materials.[3]
**** Ductile materials[edit] ****
A stressâstrain curve typical of structural_steel.
===============================================================================
    * 1: Ultimate_strength
    * 2: Yield_strength_(yield_point)
    * 3: Rupture
    * 4: Strain_hardening region
    * 5: Necking region
    * A: Apparent stress (F/A0)
    * B: Actual stress (F/A)
Ductile materials, which includes structural steel and many alloys of other
metals, are characterized by their ability to yield at normal temperatures.[4]
Low carbon steel generally exhibits a very linear stressâstrain relationship
up to a well defined yield_point (Fig.2). The linear portion of the curve is
the elastic region and the slope is the modulus_of_elasticity or Young's
Modulus . Many ductile materials including some metals, polymers and ceramics
exhibit a yield point. Plastic flow initiates at the upper yield point and
continues at the lower one. At lower yield point, permanent deformation is
heterogeneously distributed along the sample. The deformation band which formed
at the upper yield point will propagate along the gauge length at the lower
yield point. The band occupies the whole of the gauge at the luders strain.
Beyond this point, work hardening commences. The appearance of the yield point
is associated with pinning of dislocations in the system. For example, solid
solution interacts with dislocations and acts as pin and prevent dislocation
from moving. Therefore, the stress needed to initiate the movement will be
large. As long as the dislocation escape from the pinning, stress needed to
continue it is less.
After the yield point, the curve typically decreases slightly because of
dislocations escaping from Cottrell_atmospheres. As deformation continues, the
stress increases on account of strain_hardening until it reaches the ultimate
tensile_stress. Until this point, the cross-sectional area decreases uniformly
because of Poisson_contractions. Then it starts necking and finally fractures.
The appearance of necking in ductile materials is associated with geometrical
instability in the system. Due to the natural inhomogeneity of the material, it
is common to find some regions with small inclusions or porosity within it or
surface, where strain will concentrate, leading to a locally smaller area than
other regions. For strain less than the ultimate tensile strain, the increase
of work-hardening rate in this region will be greater than the area reduction
rate, thereby make this region harder to be further deform than others, so that
the instability will be removed, i.e. the materials have abilities to weaken
the inhomogeneity before reaching ultimate strain. However, as the strain
become larger, the work hardening rate will decreases, so that for now the
region with smaller area is weaker than other region, therefore reduction in
area will concentrate in this region and the neck becomes more and more
pronounced until fracture. After the neck has formed in the materials, further
plastic deformation is concentrated in the neck while the remainder of the
material undergoes elastic contraction owing to the decrease in tensile force.
The stress-strain curve for a ductile material can be approximated using the
Ramberg-Osgood equation.[5] This equation is straightforward to implement, and
only requires the material's yield strength, ultimate strength, elastic
modulus, and percent elongation.
Fig.5 Stressâstrain curve for brittle materials compared to ductile
materials.

**** Brittle materials[edit] ****
Brittle materials, which includes cast iron, glass, and stone, are
characterized by the fact that rupture occurs without any noticeable prior
change in the rate of elongation,[6] sometimes they fracture before yielding.
Brittle materials such as concrete or carbon_fiber do not have a well-defined
yield point, and do not strain-harden. Therefore, the ultimate strength and
breaking strength are the same. A typical stressâstrain curve is shown in
Fig.5. Typical brittle materials like glass do not show any plastic_deformation
but fail while the deformation is elastic. One of the characteristics of a
brittle failure is that the two broken parts can be reassembled to produce the
same shape as the original component as there will not be a neck formation like
in the case of ductile materials. A typical stressâstrain curve for a brittle
material will be linear. For some materials, such as concrete, tensile strength
is negligible compared to the compressive strength and it is assumed zero for
many engineering applications. Glass_fibers have a tensile_strength stronger
than steel, but bulk glass usually does not. This is because of the stress
intensity_factor associated with defects in the material. As the size of the
sample gets larger, the size of defects also grows. In general, the tensile
strength of a rope is always less than the sum of the tensile strengths of its
individual fibers.


***** Influencing factors[edit] *****
stressâstrain curves of various materials vary widely, as a result of various
intrinsic structures and compositions. Due to extrinsic factors, different
tensile tests conducted on the same material yield different results, mainly
depending upon the temperature of the specimen and the speed of the loading.
The boundary between intrinsic and extrinsic factors is not rigid, if further
mechanism is illustrated. Many factors can have an influence on the stress-
strain curve by adjusting Young' modulus, strengening, toughening, as long as
they modify the structure and compositions.
Time is often neglected in the stress-strain curve relations, but at higher
strain rates, higher stresses will occur according to the relationship
     &#x03C3;  t    = K (     &#x03F5; &#x02D9;     T    )  m
{\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma _{t}} =K({\dot {\epsilon }}_{T})^{m}}  [
{\displaystyle \mathrm {\sigma _{t}} =K({\dot {\epsilon }}_{T})^{m}}]
where m is the strain rate sensitivity. The higher m is, the greater resistance
to necking this material will have, just like the case of work-hardening
coefficient.
Another dominant factor is the temperature. Temperature controls the activation
of dislocations and diffusions. As the temperature increases, brittle materials
can be transformed into ductile materials.
