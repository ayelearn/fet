A direct readout theodolite, manufactured in the Soviet Union in 1958 and used
for topographic surveying
A theodolite /Î¸iËËÉdÉlaÉªt/ is a precision optical instrument for
measuring angles between designated visible points in the horizontal_and
vertical planes. The traditional use has been for land_surveying, but they are
also used extensively for building_and_infrastructure_construction, and some
specialized applications such as meteorology and rocket_launching.[1]
It consists of a moveable telescope mounted so it can rotate around horizontal
and vertical axes and provide angular readouts. These indicate the orientation
of the telescope, and are used to relate the first point sighted through the
telescope to subsequent sightings of other points from the same theodolite
position. These angles can be measured with great accuracy, typically to
milliradian or seconds_of_arc. From these readings a plan can be drawn, or
objects can be positioned in accordance with an existing plan. The modern
theodolite has evolved into what is known as a total_station where angles and
distances are measured electronically, and are read directly to computer
memory.
In a transit theodolite, the telescope is short enough to rotate through the
zenith, otherwise for non-transit instruments vertical (or altitude), rotation
is restricted to a limited arc.
The optical_level is sometimes mistaken for a theodolite, but it does not
measure vertical angles, and is used only for levelling on a horizontal_plane.

**** Preparation for making sightings[edit] ****
Main article: Temporary_adjustments_of_theodolites
Temporary adjustments are a set of operations necessary in order to make a
theodolite ready for taking observations at a station. These include its
setting up, centering, leveling up and elimination of parallax, and are
achieved in four steps:
    * Setting up - fixing the theodolite onto a tripod along with approximate
      levelling and centering over the station mark.
    * Centering - bringing the vertical axis of theodolite immediately over
      station mark using a centering plate also known as a tribrach.
    * Levelling - leveling of the base of the instrument to make the vertical
      axis vertical usually with an in-built bubble-level.
    * Focusing - removing parallax error by proper focusing of objective and
      eye-piece. The eye-piece only requires adjustment once at a station. The
      objective will be re-focused for each subsequent sightings from this
      station because of the different distances to the target.
**** Sightings[edit] ****
Sightings are taken by the surveyor, who adjusts the telescope's vertical and
horizontal angular orientation so the cross-hairs align with the desired
sighting point. Both angles are read either from exposed or internal scales and
recorded. The next object is then sighted and recorded without moving the
position of the instrument and tripod.
The earliest angular readouts were from open vernier_scales directly visible to
the eye. Gradually these scales were enclosed for physical protection, and
finally became an indirect optical readout, with convoluted light paths to
bring them to a convenient place on the instrument for viewing. The modern
digital theodolites have electronic displays.
**** Errors in measurement[edit] ****
Index error - The angles in the vertical axis should read 90Â° (100 grad) when
the sight axis is horizontal, or 270Â° (300 grad) when the instrument is
transited. Half of the difference between the two positions is called the
"index error". This can only be checked on transit instruments.
Horizontal axis error - The horizontal and vertical axes of a theodolite must
be perpendicular; if not then a "horizontal axis error" exists. This can be
tested by aligning the tubular spirit bubble parallel to a line between two
footscrews and setting the bubble central. A horizontal axis error is present
if the bubble runs off central when the tubular spirit bubble is reversed
(turned through 180Â°). To adjust, the operator removes 1/2 the amount the
bubble has run off using the adjusting screw, then re-level, test and refine
the adjustment.
Collimation error - The optical axis of the telescope, must also be
perpendicular to the horizontal axis. If not, then a "collimation error"
exists.
Index error, horizontal-axis error ('trunnion-axis error') and collimation
error are regularly determined by calibration and are removed by mechanical
adjustment. Their existence is taken into account in the choice of measurement
procedure in order to eliminate their effect on the measurement results of the
theodolite.
***** History[edit] *****
A theodolite of 1851, showing the open construction, and the altitude and
azimuth scales which are read directly.
Sectioned theodolite showing the complex light paths for optical readout, and
the enclosed construction.
The term diopter was sometimes used in old texts as a synonym for theodolite.
[2] This derives from an older astronomical instrument called a dioptra.
Prior to the theodolite, instruments such as the groma, geometric_square and
various other graduated circles (see circumferentor) and semicircles (see
graphometer) were used to obtain either vertical or horizontal angle
measurements. It was only a matter of time before someone put two measuring
devices into a single instrument that could measure both angles simultaneously.
Gregorius_Reisch showed such an instrument in the appendix of his book
Margarita Philosophica, which he published in Strasburg in 1512.[3] It was
described in the appendix by Martin_WaldseemÃ¼ller, a German topographer and
cartographer, who made the device in the same year.[4] WaldseemÃ¼ller called
his instrument the polimetrum.[5]
The first occurrence of the word "theodolite" is found in the surveying
textbook A geometric practice named Pantometria (1571) by Leonard_Digges, which
was published posthumously by his son, Thomas Digges.[3] The etymology of the
word is unknown. The first part of the New_Latin theo-delitus might stem from
the Greek Î¸Îµá¾¶ÏÎ¸Î±Î¹, "to behold or look attentively upon"[6] or Î¸Îµá¿Î½
"to run",[7] but the second part is more puzzling and is often attributed to an
unscholarly variation of one of the following Greek words: Î´á¿Î»Î¿Ï, meaning
"evident" or "clear",[8][9] or Î´Î¿Î»Î¹ÏÏÏ "long", or Î´Î¿á¿¦Î»Î¿Ï "slave",
or an unattested Neolatin compound combining á½Î´ÏÏ "way" and Î»Î¹ÏÏÏ
"plain".[7] It has been also suggested that -delitus is a variation of the
Latin supine deletus, in the sense of "crossed out".[7] Another theory is that
it may be derived from the Arabic "alidhada" prefixed by the English "the".[10]
There is some confusion about the instrument to which the name was originally
applied. Some identify the early theodolite as an azimuth instrument only,
while others specify it as an altazimuth instrument. In Digges's book, the name
"theodolite" described an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only. He
also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he
called a topographicall instrument [sic].[11] Thus the name originally applied
only to the azimuth instrument and only later became associated with the
altazimuth instrument. The 1728 Cyclopaedia compares "graphometer" to "half-
theodolite".[12] Even as late as the 19th century, the instrument for measuring
horizontal angles only was called a simple theodolite and the altazimuth
instrument, the plain theodolite.[13]
The first instrument more like a true theodolite was likely the one built by
Joshua_Habermel (Erasmus_Habermehl) in Germany in 1576, complete with compass
and tripod.[4]
The earliest altazimuth instruments consisted of a base graduated with a full
circle at the limb and a vertical angle measuring device, most often a
semicircle. An alidade on the base was used to sight an object for horizontal
angle measurement, and a second alidade was mounted on the vertical semicircle.
Later instruments had a single alidade on the vertical semicircle and the
entire semicircle was mounted so as to be used to indicate horizontal angles
directly. Eventually, the simple, open-sight alidade was replaced with a
sighting telescope. This was first done by Jonathan_Sisson in 1725.[13]
The theodolite became a modern, accurate instrument in 1787, with the
introduction of Jesse_Ramsden's famous great_theodolite, which he created using
a very accurate dividing_engine of his own design.[13] The demand could not be
met by foreign theodolites owing to their inadequate precision, hence all
instruments meeting high precision requirements were made in England. Despite
the many German instrument builders at the turn of the century, there were no
usable German theodolites available. A transition was brought about by
Breithaupt and the symbiosis of Utzschneider, Reichenbach and Fraunhofer.[14]
As technology progressed, in the 1840s, the vertical partial circle was
replaced with a full circle, and both vertical and horizontal circles were
finely graduated. This was the transit theodolite. Theodolites were later
adapted to a wider variety of mountings and uses. In the 1870s, an interesting
waterborne version of the theodolite (using a pendulum device to counteract
wave movement) was invented by Edward_Samuel_Ritchie.[15] It was used by the
U.S. Navy to take the first precision surveys of American harbors on the
Atlantic and Gulf coasts.[16]
In the early part of the 20th century, Heinrich_Wild produced theodolites that
became popular with surveyors. His Wild T2, T3, and A1 instruments were made
for many years, and he would go on to develop the DK1, DKM1, DM2, DKM2, and
DKM3 for Kern Aarau company. With continuing refinements, instruments steadily
evolved into the modern theodolite used by surveyors today.
**** Operation in surveying[edit] ****
Main article: Triangulation_(surveying)
U.S._National_Geodetic_Survey technicians observing with a 0.2 arcsecond (â
0.001 mrad or 1 Âµrad) resolution Wild T3 theodolite mounted on an observing
stand. Photo was taken during an Arctic field party (c. 1950).
Triangulation, as invented by Gemma_Frisius around 1533, consists of making
such direction plots of the surrounding landscape from two separate
standpoints. The two graphing papers are superimposed, providing a scale model
of the landscape, or rather the targets in it. The true scale can be obtained
by measuring one distance both in the real terrain and in the graphical
representation.
Modern triangulation as, e.g., practised by Snellius, is the same procedure
executed by numerical means. Photogrammetric block adjustment of stereo pairs
of aerial photographs is a modern, three-dimensional variant.
In the late 1780s, Jesse_Ramsden, a Yorkshireman from Halifax, England who had
developed the dividing_engine for dividing angular scales accurately to within
a second of arc (â 0.0048 mrad or 4.8 Âµrad), was commissioned to build a new
instrument for the British Ordnance_Survey. The Ramsden_theodolite was used
over the next few years to map the whole of southern Britain by triangulation.
In network measurement, the use of forced centering speeds up operations while
maintaining the highest precision. The theodolite or the target can be rapidly
removed from, or socketed into, the forced centering plate with sub-millimeter
precision. Nowadays GPS antennas used for geodetic_positioning use a similar
mounting system. The height of the reference point of the theodoliteâor the
targetâabove the ground benchmark must be measured precisely.
**** Transit theodolite[edit] ****
The term transit theodolite, or transit for short, refers to a type of
theodolite that was developed in the early 19th century. It was popular with
American railroad engineers pushing west, and it replaced the railroad_compass,
sextant and octant. It features a vertical circle which is graduated through
the full 360 degrees and a telescope that could "flip over" ("transit the
scope"). By reversing the telescope and at the same time rotating the
instrument through 180 degrees about the vertical axis, the instrument can be
used in 'plate-left' or 'plate-right' modes ('plate' refers to the vertical
protractor circle). By measuring the same horizontal and vertical angles in
these two modes and then averaging the results, centering and collimating
errors in the instrument can be eliminated. Some transit instruments are
capable of reading angles directly to thirty arc-seconds (â 0.15 mrad).
Modern theodolites are usually of the transit-theodolite design, but engraved
plates have been replaced with glass plates designed to be read with light-
emitting_diodes and computer circuitry, greatly improving accuracy up to arc-
second (â 0.005 mrad) levels.
***** Use with weather balloons[edit] *****
There is a long history of theodolite use in measuring winds aloft, by using
specially-manufactured theodolites to track the horizontal and vertical angles
of special weather balloons called ceiling_balloons or pilot balloons (pibal).
Early attempts at this were made in the opening years of the nineteenth
century, but the instruments and procedures weren't fully developed until a
hundred years later. This method was extensively used in World War II and
thereafter, and was gradually replaced by radio and GPS measuring systems from
the 1980s onward.
The pibal theodolite uses a prism to bend the optical path by 90 degrees so the
operator's eye position does not change as the elevation is changed through a
complete 180 degrees. The theodolite is typically mounted on a rugged steel
stand, set up so it is level and pointed north, with the altitude and azimuth
scales reading zero degrees. A balloon is released in front of the theodolite,
and its position is precisely tracked, usually once a minute. The balloons are
carefully constructed and filled, so their rate of ascent can be known fairly
accurately in advance. Mathematical calculations on time, rate of ascent,
azimuth and angular altitude can produce good estimates of wind speed and
direction at various altitudes.[17]
***** Modern electronic theodolites[edit] *****
A typical modern electronic theodolite: Nikon DTM-520
In modern electronic theodolites, the readout of the horizontal and vertical
circles is usually done with a rotary_encoder. These produce signals indicating
the altitude and azimuth of the telescope which are fed to a microprocessor.
CCD sensors have been added to the focal_plane of the telescope allowing both
auto-targeting and the automated measurement of residual target offset. All
this is implemented in embedded software of the processor.
Many modern theodolites are equipped with integrated electro-optical distance
measuring devices, generally infrared based, allowing the measurement in one
step of complete three-dimensional vectorsâalbeit in instrument-defined polar
co-ordinates, which can then be transformed to a pre-existing co-ordinate
system in the area by means of a sufficient number of control_points. This
technique is called a resection solution or free_station_position_surveying and
is widely used in mapping surveying.
Such instruments are "intelligent" theodolites called self-registering
tacheometers or colloquially "total_stations", and perform all the necessary
angular and distance calculations, and the results or raw data can be
downloaded to external processors, such as ruggedized laptops, PDAs or
programmable_calculators[18]
***** Gyrotheodolites[edit] *****
Main article: gyrotheodolite
A gyrotheodolite is used when the north-south reference bearing of the meridian
is required in the absence of astronomical star sights. This occurs mainly in
the underground mining industry and in tunnel engineering. For example, where a
conduit must pass under a river, a vertical shaft on each side of the river
might be connected by a horizontal tunnel. A gyrotheodolite can be operated at
the surface and then again at the foot of the shafts to identify the directions
needed to tunnel between the base of the two shafts. Unlike an artificial
horizon or inertial navigation system, a gyrotheodolite cannot be relocated
while it is operating. It must be restarted again at each site.
The gyrotheodolite comprises a normal theodolite with an attachment that
contains a gyroscope mounted so as to sense rotation of the Earth and from that
the alignment of the meridian. The meridian is the plane that contains both the
axis of the Earth's rotation and the observer. The intersection of the meridian
plane with the horizontal contains the true north-south geographic reference
bearing required. The gyrotheodolite is usually referred to as being able to
determine or find true north.
A gyrotheodolite will function at the equator and in both the northern and
southern hemispheres. The meridian is undefined at the geographic poles. A
gyrotheodolite cannot be used at the poles where the Earth's axis is precisely
perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the spinner, indeed it is not normally
used within about 15 degrees of the pole because the east-west component of the
Earth's rotation is insufficient to obtain reliable results. When available,
astronomical star sights are able to give the meridian bearing to better than
one hundred times the accuracy of the gyrotheodolite. Where this extra
precision is not required, the gyrotheodolite is able to produce a result
quickly without the need for night observations.
