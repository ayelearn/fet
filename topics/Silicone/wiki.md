Not to be confused with the chemical element silicon.
Silicone can be used as a basic sealant against water and air penetration.
Silicones, also known as polysiloxanes, are polymers that include any synthetic
compound made up of repeating units of siloxane, which is a chain of
alternating silicon atoms and oxygen atoms, combined with carbon, hydrogen, and
sometimes other elements. They are typically heat-resistant and either liquid
or rubber-like, and are used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine,
cooking utensils, and thermal and electrical insulation. Some common forms
include silicone_oil, silicone_grease, silicone_rubber, silicone_resin, and
silicone caulk.[1]

***** Chemistry[edit] *****
Chemical structure of the silicone polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
More precisely called polymerized siloxanes or polysiloxanes, silicones consist
of an inorganic silicon-oxygen backbone_chain
(â¯âSiâOâSiâOâSiâOââ¯) with organic side groups attached to the
silicon atoms. These silicon atoms are tetravalent. So, silicones are polymers
constructed from inorganic-organic monomers. Silicones have in general the
chemical formula [R2SiO]n, where R is an organic group such as an alkyl
(methyl, ethyl) or phenyl_group.
In some cases, organic side groups can be used to link two or more of these
âSiâOâ backbones together. By varying the âSiâOâ chain lengths,
side groups, and crosslinking, silicones can be synthesized with a wide variety
of properties and compositions. They can vary in consistency from liquid to gel
to rubber to hard plastic. The most common siloxane is linear
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicone_oil. The second largest group of
silicone materials is based on silicone_resins, which are formed by branched
and cage-like oligosiloxanes.
**** Terminology and history[edit] ****
F._S._Kipping coined the word silicone in 1901 to describe polydiphenylsiloxane
by analogy of its formula, Ph2SiO (Ph stands for phenyl, C6H5), with the
formula of the ketone benzophenone, Ph2CO (his term was originally
silicoketone). Kipping was well aware that polydiphenylsiloxane is polymeric
whereas benzophenone is monomeric and noted that Ph2SiO and Ph2CO had very
different chemistry.[2][3] The discovery of the structural differences between
Kipping's molecules and the ketones means that silicone is no longer the
correct term (though it remains in common usage) and that the term siloxanes is
correct according to the nomenclature of modern chemistry.[4]
Silicone is often confused with silicon, but they are distinct substances.
Silicon is a chemical_element, a hard dark-grey semiconducting metalloid which
in its crystalline form is used to make integrated_circuits ("electronic
chips") and solar_cells. Silicones are compounds that contain silicon, carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, and perhaps other kinds of atoms as well, and have very
different physical and chemical properties.
Compounds containing silicon-oxygen double bonds, now called silanones but
which could deserve the name "silicone", have long been identified as
intermediates in gas-phase processes such as chemical_vapor_deposition in
microelectronics production, and in the formation_of_ceramics by combustion.[5]
However they have a strong tendency to polymerize into siloxanes. The first
stable silanone was obtained in 2014 by A._Filippou and others.[6]
**** Synthesis[edit] ****
Most common are materials based on polydimethylsiloxane, which is derived by
hydrolysis of dimethyldichlorosilane. This dichloride reacts with water as
follows:
      n Si(CH3)2Cl2 + n H2O â [Si(CH3)2O]n + 2n HCl
The polymerization typically produces linear chains capped with SiâCl or
SiâOH (silanol) groups. Under different conditions the polymer is a cyclic,
not a chain.[1]
For consumer applications such as caulks silyl acetates are used instead of
silyl chlorides. The hydrolysis of the acetates produce the less dangerous
acetic_acid (the acid found in vinegar) as the reaction product of a much
slower curing process. This chemistry is used in many consumer applications,
such as silicone caulk and adhesives.
Branches or crosslinks in the polymer chain can be introduced by using
organosilicone precursors with fewer alkyl groups, such as
methyltrichlorosilane and methyltrimethoxysilane. Ideally, each molecule of
such a compound becomes a branch point. This process can be used to produce
hard silicone resins. Similarly, precursors with three methyl groups can be
used to limit molecular weight, since each such molecule has only one reactive
site and so forms the end of a siloxane chain.
**** Combustion[edit] ****
When silicone is burned in air or oxygen, it forms solid silica (silicon
dioxide, SiO2) as a white powder, char, and various gases. The readily
dispersed powder is sometimes called silica_fume. The pyrolysis of certain
polysiloxanes under an inert_atmosphere is a valuable pathway towards the
production of amorphous silicon_oxycarbide ceramics, also known as polymer
derived_ceramics. Polysiloxanes terminated with functional ligands such as
vinyl, mercapto or acrylate groups have been cross linked to yield preceramic
polymers, which can be photopolymerised for the additive_manufacturing of
polymer_derived_ceramics by stereolithography techniques.[7]
***** Properties[edit] *****
Silicones exhibit many useful characteristics, including:[1]
    * Low thermal_conductivity
    * Low chemical reactivity
    * Low toxicity
    * Thermal stability (constancy of properties over a wide temperature range
      of â100 to 250 Â°C).
    * The ability to repel water and form watertight seals.
    * Does not stick to many substrates, but adheres very well to others, e.g.
      glass.
    * Does not support microbiological growth.
    * Resistance to oxygen, ozone, and ultraviolet_(UV)_light. This property
      has led to widespread use of silicones in the construction industry (e.g.
      coatings, fire protection, glazing seals) and the automotive industry
      (external gaskets, external trim).
    * Electrical_insulation properties. Because silicone can be formulated to
      be electrically insulative or conductive, it is suitable for a wide range
      of electrical applications.
    * High gas_permeability: at room temperature (25 Â°C), the permeability of
      silicone_rubber for such gases as oxygen is approximately 400 times
      [citation_needed] that of butyl_rubber, making silicone useful for
      medical applications in which increased aeration is desired. Conversely,
      silicone rubbers cannot be used where gas-tight seals are necessary.
Silicone can be developed into rubber sheeting, where it has other properties,
such as being FDA compliant. This extends the uses of silicone sheeting to
industries that demand hygiene, for example, food and beverage and
pharmaceutical.
***** Uses[edit] *****
Silicones are used in many products. Ullmann's_Encyclopedia_of_Industrial
Chemistry lists the following major categories of application: Electrical
(e.g., insulation), electronics (e.g., coatings), household (e.g., sealants and
cooking utensils), automobile (e.g., gaskets), aeroplane (e.g., seals), office
machines (e.g., keyboard pads), medicine and dentistry (e.g., tooth impression
molds), textiles and paper (e.g., coatings). For these applications, an
estimated 400,000 tonnes of silicones were produced in 1991.[clarification
needed] Specific examples, both large and small are presented below.[1]
**** Automotive[edit] ****
In the automotive field, silicone_grease is typically used as a lubricant for
brake components since it is stable at high temperatures, is not water-soluble,
and is far less likely than other lubricants to foul. DOT_5 brake_fluids are
based on liquid silicones.
Automotive spark plug wires are insulated by multiple layers of silicone to
prevent sparks from jumping to adjacent wires, causing misfires. Silicone
tubing is sometimes used in automotive intake systems (especially for engines
with forced_induction).
Sheet silicone is used to manufacture gaskets used in automotive_engines,
transmissions, and other applications.
Automotive body manufacturing plants and paint shops avoid silicones, as they
may cause "fish eyes", small, circular craters in the finish.
Additionally, silicone compounds such as silicone rubber are used as coatings
and sealants for airbags; the high strength of silicone rubber makes it an
optimal adhesive and sealant for high impact airbags. Recent technological
advancements allow convenient use of silicone in combination with
thermoplastics to provide improvements in scratch and mar resistance and
lowered coefficient of friction.
**** Aerospace[edit] ****
Silicone is a widely used material in the aerospace_industry due to its sealing
properties, stability across an extreme temperature range, durability, sound
dampening and  anti-vibration qualities, and naturally flame retardant
properties. Maintaining extreme functionality is paramount for passenger safety
in the aerospace industry, so each component on an aircraft requires high-
performance materials.
Specially developed aerospace grades of silicone are stable from â70 to 220
Â°C,[8] these grades can be used in the construction of gaskets for windows and
cabin doors. During operation, aircraft go through large temperature
fluctuations in a relatively short period of time; from freezing temperatures
when flying at full altitude to the ambient temperatures when on the ground in
hot countries. Silicone rubber can be moulded with tight tolerances ensuring
gaskets form airtight seals both on the ground and in the air, where
atmospheric pressure decreases.
Silicone rubber's resistance to heat corrosion enables it to be used for
gaskets in aircraft engines where it will outlast other types of rubber, both
improving aircraft safety and reducing maintenance costs. Silicone acts to seal
instrument panels and other electrical systems in the cockpit, protecting
printed circuit boards from the risks of extreme altitude such as moisture and
extreme low temperature. Silicone can be used as a sheath to protect wires and
electrical components from any dust or ice that may creep into a plane's inner
workings.
As the nature of air travel results in lots of noise and vibration, powerful
engines, landings and high speeds all need to be considered to ensure passenger
comfort and safe operation of the aircraft. As silicone rubber has exceptional
noise reduction and anti-vibration properties, it can be formed into small
components and fitted into small gaps ensuring all equipment can be protected
from unwanted vibration such as: overhead lockers, vent ducts, hatches,
entertainment system seals, and LED lighting systems.
**** Coatings[edit] ****
Silicone films can be applied to such silica-based substrates as glass to form
a covalently bonded hydrophobic coating.
Many fabrics can be coated or impregnated with silicone to form a strong,
waterproof composite such as silnylon.
**** Cookware[edit] ****
Soup ladle and pasta ladle made of silicone
A silicone food steamer to be placed inside a pot of boiling water
Ice cube trays made of silicone
    * As a low-taint, non-toxic material, silicone can be used where contact
      with food is required. Silicone is becoming an important product in the
      cookware industry, particularly bakeware and kitchen_utensils.
    * Silicone is used as an insulator in heat-resistant potholders and similar
      items; however, it is more conductive of heat than similar less dense
      fiber-based products. Silicone oven mitts are able to withstand
      temperatures up to 260 Â°C (500 Â°F), allowing reaching into boiling
      water.
    * Molds for chocolate, ice, cookies, muffins and various other foods.
    * Non-stick bakeware and reusable mats used on baking sheets.
    * Other products such as steamers, egg boilers or poachers, cookware lids,
      pot_holders, trivets, and kitchen mats.
**** Defoaming[edit] ****
Silicones are used as active compound in defoamers due to their low water
solubility and good spreading properties.
**** Dry cleaning[edit] ****
Liquid silicone can be used as a dry_cleaning solvent, providing an alternative
to the traditional chlorine-containing perchloroethylene_(perc) solvent. Use of
silicones in dry cleaning reduces the environmental effect of a typically high-
polluting industry.
**** Electronics[edit] ****
Electronic components are sometimes encased in silicone to increase stability
against mechanical and electrical shock, radiation and vibration, a process
called "potting".
Silicones are used where durability and high performance are demanded of
components under hard conditions, such as in space (satellite technology). They
are selected over polyurethane or epoxy encapsulation when a wide operating
temperature range is required (â65 to 315 Â°C). Silicones also have the
advantage of little exothermic heat rise during cure, low toxicity, good
electrical properties and high purity.
The use of silicones in electronics is not without problems, however. Silicones
are relatively expensive and can be attacked by solvents. Silicone easily
migrates as either a liquid or vapor onto other components.
Silicone contamination of electrical switch contacts can lead to failures by
causing an increase in contact resistance, often late in the life of the
contact, well after any testing is completed.[9][10] Use of silicone-based
spray products in electronic devices during maintenance or repairs can cause
later failures.
**** Firestops[edit] ****
 Wikimedia Commons has media related to Silicone_foam.
Silicone_foam has been used in North American buildings in an attempt to
firestop openings within fire-resistance-rated wall and floor assemblies to
prevent the spread of flames and smoke from one room to another. When properly
installed, silicone-foam firestops can be fabricated for building code
compliance. Advantages include flexibility and high dielectric strength.
Disadvantages include combustibility (hard to extinguish) and significant smoke
development.
Silicone-foam firestops have been the subject of controversy and press
attention due to smoke development from pyrolysis of combustible components
within the foam, hydrogen gas escape, shrinkage and cracking. These problems
have led to reportable events among licensees (operators of nuclear_power
plants) of the Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission_(NRC).
Silicone firestops are also used in aircraft.
    * Silicone "foamfixer" pump used to apply silicone foam firestop materials
    * Self-leveling silicone firestop system used around copper pipe through-
      penetrations in a two-hour fire-resistance_rated concrete floor assembly
    * Faulty silicone foam firestop installation in Calgary Sewage Treatment
      Plant in Canada in the 1980s, attempting to seal the opening above a fire
      door in a cast concrete fire separation, but improperly set due to wide
      temperature variations
**** Lubricants[edit] ****
Silicone greases are used for many purposes, such as bicycle_chains, airsoft
gun parts, and a wide range of other mechanisms. Typically, a dry-set lubricant
is delivered with a solvent carrier to penetrate the mechanism. The solvent
then evaporates, leaving a clear film that lubricates but does not attract dirt
and grit as much as an oil-based or other traditional "wet" lubricant.
Silicone personal lubricants are also available for use in medical procedures
or sexual activity. See below.
**** Medicine[edit] ****
Silicone is used in microfluidics, seals, gaskets, shrouds, and other
applications requiring high biocompatibility. Additionally, the gel form is
used in bandages and dressings, breast_implants, testicle implants, pectoral
implants, contact_lenses, and a variety of other medical uses.
Scar_treatment_sheets are often made of medical_grade_silicone due to its
durability and biocompatibility. Polydimethylsiloxane is often used for this
purpose, since its specific crosslinking results in a flexible and soft
silicone with high durability and tack.
Polydimethylsiloxane_(PDMS) has been used as the hydrophobic block of
amphiphilic synthetic block copolymers used to form the vesicle membrane of
polymersomes.
Illicit silicone injections always induce chronic and definitive silicone blood
diffusion with dermatologic complications.[11]
**** Moldmaking[edit] ****
Two-part silicone systems are used as rubber molds to cast resins, foams,
rubber, and low-temperature alloys. A silicone mold generally requires little
or no mold-release or surface preparation, as most materials do not adhere to
silicone. For experimental uses, ordinary one-part silicone can be used to make
molds or to mold into shapes. If needed, common vegetable_cooking_oils or
petroleum_jelly can be used on mating surfaces as a mold-release agent.[12]
Silicone mold
Cooking molds used as bakeware do not require coating with cooking oil,
allowing the baked food to be more easily removed from the mold after cooking.
**** Ophthalmology[edit] ****
Silicone has many applications like silicone oil used to replace the vitreous
humor following vitrectomy, silicone intraocular lenses following cataract
extraction, silicone tubes to keep nasolacrimal passage open following
dacrycystorhinostomy, canalicular stents for canalicular stenosis, punctal
plugs for punctal occlusion in dry eyes, silicone rubber and bands as an
external tamponade in tractional retinal detachment, and anteriorly located
break in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
**** Personal care[edit] ****
Silicones are ingredients widely used in skin care, color cosmetic and hair
care applications. Some silicones, notably the amine functionalized
amodimethicones, are excellent hair conditioners, providing improved
compatibility, feel, and softness, and lessening frizz. The
phenyltrimethicones, in another silicone family, are used in reflection-
enhancing and color-correcting hair products, where they increase shine and
glossiness (and possibly effect subtle color changes). Phenyltrimethicones,
unlike the conditioning amodimethicones, have refractive indices (typically
1.46) close to that of human hair (1.54). However, if included in the same
formulation, amodimethicone and phenyltrimethicone interact and dilute each
other, making it difficult to achieve both high shine and excellent
conditioning in the same product.[13]
Silicone rubber is commonly used in baby_bottle nipples (teats) for its
cleanliness, aesthetic appearance, and low extractable content.
Silicones are used in shaving_products and personal_lubricants.[14]
**** Plumbing and building construction[edit] ****
The strength and reliability of silicone_rubber is widely acknowledged in the
construction industry. One-part silicone sealants and caulks are in common use
to seal gaps, joints and crevices in buildings. One-part silicones cure by
absorbing atmospheric moisture, which simplifies installation. In plumbing,
silicone grease is typically applied to O-rings in brass taps and valves,
preventing lime from sticking to the metal.
**** Toys and hobbies[edit] ****
Silly_Putty and similar materials are composed of silicones dimethyl_siloxane,
polydimethylsiloxane, and decamethyl_cyclopentasiloxane, with other
ingredients. This substance is noted for its unusual characteristics, e.g.,
that it bounces, but breaks when given a sharp blow; it can also flow like a
liquid and will form a puddle given enough time.
Silicone "rubber bands" are a long-lasting popular replacement refill for real
rubber bands in the 2013 fad "rubber_band_loom" toys at two to four times the
price (in 2014). Silicone bands also come in bracelet sizes that can be custom
embossed with a name or message. Large silicone bands are also sold as utility
tie-downs.
Formerol is a silicone rubber (marketed as Sugru) used as an arts-and-crafts
material, as its plasticity allows it to be moulded by hand like modeling clay.
It hardens at room temperature and it is adhesive to various substances
including glass and aluminum.[15]
In making aquariums, manufacturers now commonly use 100% silicone sealant to
join glass plates. Glass joints made with silicone sealant can withstand great
pressure, making obsolete the original aquarium construction method of angle-
iron and putty. This same silicone is used to make hinges in aquarium lids or
for minor repairs. However, not all commercial silicones are safe for aquarium
manufacture, nor is silicone used for the manufacture of acrylic aquariums as
silicones do not have long-term adhesion to plastics.[16]
***** Production and marketing[edit] *****
The global demand for silicones approached US$12.5 billion in 2008,
approximately 4% up from the previous year. It continues similar growth in the
following years to reach $13.5 billion by 2010. The annual growth is expected
to be boosted by broader applications, introduction of novel products and
increasing awareness of using more environmentally friendly materials.[17]
The leading global manufacturers of silicone base materials belong to three
regional organizations: the European Silicone Center (CES) in Brussels,
Belgium; the Environment Health and Safety Council (SEHSC) in Herndon,
Virginia, USA; and the Silicone Industry Association of Japan (SIAJ) in Tokyo,
Japan. Dow Corning Silicones, Evonik Industries, Momentive Performance
Materials, Milliken and Company (SiVance Specialty Silicones), Shin-Etsu
Silicones, Wacker Chemie, Bluestar Silicones, JNC Corporation, Wacker
Asahikasei Silicone, and Dow Corning Toray represent the collective membership
of these organizations. A fourth organization, the Global Silicone Council
(GSC) acts as an umbrella structure over the regional organizations. All four
are non-profit, having no commercial role; their primary missions are to
promote the safety of silicones from a health, safety, and environmental
perspective. As the European chemical industry is preparing to implement the
Registration,_Evaluation_and_Authorisation_of_Chemicals_(REACH)_legislation,
CES is leading the formation of a consortium[18] of silicones, silanes, and
siloxanes producers and importers to facilitate data and cost sharing.
***** Safety and environmental considerations[edit] *****
Silicone compounds are pervasive in the environment. Particular silicone
compounds, cyclic siloxanes D4 and D5, are air and water pollutants and have
negative health effects on test animals.[19] They are used in various personal
care products. The European Chemicals Agency found that "D4 is a persistent,
bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substance and D5 is a very persistent, very
bioaccumulative (vPvB) substance".[20][21] Other silicones biodegrade readily,
a process that is accelerated by a variety of catalysts, including clays.[1]
Cyclic silicones have been shown to involve the occurrence of silanols during
biodegration in mammals.[22] The resulting silanediols and silanetriols are
capable of inhibiting hydrolytic enzymes such as thermolysin,
acetycholinesterase, however the doses required for inhibition are by orders of
magnitude higher than the ones resulting from the accumulated exposure to
consumer products containing cyclomethicones.[23][24]
Around 200 Â°C in oxygen-containing atmosphere, PDMS releases traces of
formaldehyde (but less than other common materials such as polyethylene [25]
[26]). At 200 Â°C, silicones were found to have lower formaldehyde generation
than mineral_oil and plastics (less than 3 to 48 Âµg CH2O/(gÂ·hr) for a high
consistency silicone_rubber, versus around 400 Âµg CH2O/(gÂ·hr) for plastics
and mineral oil). By 250 Â°C, copious amounts of formaldehyde have been found
to be produced for all silicones (1,200 to 4,600 Âµg CH2O/(gÂ·hr)).[26]
