Mud is a liquid or semi-liquid mixture of water and any combination of
different kinds of soil (loam, silt, and clay). It usually forms after rainfall
or near water sources. Ancient mud deposits harden over geological_time to form
sedimentary_rock such as shale or mudstone (generally called lutites). When
geological deposits of mud are formed in estuaries, the resultant layers are
termed bay_muds.

***** Building and construction[edit] *****

Arg_e_Bam, One of The largest adobe and mud buildings in the world.[1]
**** Adhesive[edit] ****
In the construction industry, mud is a semi-fluid material that can be used to
coat, seal, or adhere materials. Depending on the composition of the mud, it
can be referred by many different names, including slurry, mortar, plaster,
stucco, and concrete.
**** Material[edit] ****
Mud, cob, adobe, clay, and many other names are historically used synonymously
to mean a mixture of subsoil and water possibly with the addition of stones,
gravel, straw, lime, and/or bitumen. This material was used a variety of ways
to build walls, floors and even roofs. For thousands of years it was common in
most parts of the world to build walls using mudbricks or the wattle_and_daub,
rammed_earth or cob techniques and cover the surfaces with earthen plaster.
*** Mudbrick[edit] ***
Main article: Mudbrick
Mud house in 'Amran, Yemen
Mud can be made into mud bricks, also called adobe, by mixing mud with water,
placing the mixture into moulds and then allowing it to dry in open air.[2]
Straw is sometimes used as a binder within the bricks, as it makes them a
composite. When the brick would otherwise break, the straw will redistribute
the force throughout the brick, decreasing the chance of breakage.[3] Such
buildings must be protected from groundwater, usually by building upon a
masonry, fired brick, rock or rubble foundation, and also from wind-driven rain
in damp climates, usually by deep roof overhangs. In extremely dry climates a
well-drained flat roof may be protected with a well-prepared (puddled) and
properly maintained dried mud coating, viable as the mud will expand when
moistened and so become more water resistant.[4] Adobe mudbricks were commonly
used by the Pueblo Indians to build their homes and other necessary structures.
*** Fired brick[edit] ***
Mud that is mostly clay, or a mixture of clay and sand may be used for
ceramics, of which one form is the common fired brick. Fired brick are more
durable but consume much more energy to produce.
*** Stabilized mud[edit] ***
Stabilized mud (earth, soil) is mud which has had a binder such as cement or
bitumen added. Examples are mudcrete, landcrete, and soil_cement.
***** Pottery[edit] *****
Main article: Pottery
Pottery is made by forming a clay_body into objects of a required shape and
heating them to high temperatures in a kiln which removes all the water from
the clay, which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including
increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body
can be decorated before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay
must be prepared. Kneading helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout
the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called
de-airing and can be accomplished by a machine called a vacuum pug or manually
by wedging. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay
body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of
techniques. After shaping it is dried and then fired.
In ceramics, the making of liquid mud (called slip) is a stage in the process
of refinement of the materials, since larger particles will settle from the
liquid.
***** Habitat[edit] *****
[[icon]] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding_to_it. (January
         2011)
**** Land[edit] ****
Mud can provide a home for numerous types of animals, including varieties of
worms, frogs, snails, clams, and crayfish. Other animals, such as
hippopotamuses, pigs, rhinoceroses, water_buffalo and elephants, bathe in mud
in order to cool off and protect themselves from the sun. Submerged mud can be
home to larvae of various insects.
**** Marine life[edit] ****
Mud plays an important role in the marine_ecosystem. The activities of
burrowing animals and fish have a dramatic churning effect on muddy seabeds.
This allows the exchange and cycling of oxygen, nutrients, and minerals between
water and sediment.[5]
Below the surface, the burrows of some species form intricate lattice-like
networks and may penetrate a meter or more downwards. This means that the
burrowed mud is a productive habitat, providing food and shelter for a wide
range of mud-dwellers and other animals that forage in and over the mud.[5]
***** Problems[edit] *****
A landslide on a railroad
Mud can pose problems for motor traffic when moisture is present, because every
vehicle function that changes direction or speed relies on friction between the
tires and the road surface, so a layer of mud on the surface of the road or
tires can cause the vehicle to hydroplane.
Heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or high levels of groundwater may trigger a movement
of soil or sediments, possibly causing mudslides, landslides, avalanches, or
sinkholes.
Mudslides in volcanic terrain (called lahars) occur after eruptions as rain
remobilizes loose ash deposits.[6]
Mudslides are also common in the western_United_States during El_NiÃ±o years
due to prolonged rainfall. Another problem mud creates is it can prove
difficult to get out of if stuck, most bogs are more dangerous than quicksand
because you can sink deep in to the mud. You can drown in a peat bog because
they are deep patches of water with vegetation on top.
***** As food[edit] *****
A bowl of kava tea.
There are numerous dysphemisms for poor-tasting food such as "tastes like
dirt". Kava tea is often described this way, as it is bitter, brown, and
contains sediments.
There also exist children's recipes for "mud", which is generally a chocolate
or cornstarch-based sludge used more for visual appeal than actual taste. Never
does this confectionery mud actually contain real mud.[7]
**** Geophagia[edit] ****
Main article: Geophagia
The practice of eating earth or soil-like substances is geophagia.
***** Recreation[edit] *****
**** Mud bath[edit] ****
Main article: Mud_bath
A mud bath is a bath of mud, commonly from areas where hot spring water can
combine with volcanic_ash. Mud baths have existed for thousands of years, and
can be found now in high-end spas in many countries of the world.
**** Mud wallow[edit] ****
Mud wallows are a common source of entertainment for kids. Mud wallows can be
any shape, size, depth and some can have water as well as mud. Usually wallows
are shallow dips in the ground that have been flooded and were full of dirt and
those two have mixed to make a squishy mud wallow.
**** Mudding[edit] ****
Main article: Mud_bogging
Mud bogging is a form of off-road_motorsport popular in Canada and the United
States in which the goal is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud or a track
of a set length. Winners are determined by the distance traveled through the
pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the
time taken to traverse the pit will determine the winner.
**** Mud run[edit] ****
Mud runs are a popular activity involving mud. Participants run a distance of 3
miles to as long as 10 miles, while crawling through mud bogs, and battling
other obstacles.[8][9][10]
**** Other[edit] ****
    * Mud is used in mud wrestling as a form of entertainment.
    * Mud can be used in a dunk_tank.
    * Dirt_biking involves biking through muddy tracks and courses.
    * Baseball_Rubbing_Mud is used to remove the sheen from new baseballs.
    * Children often like to make 'mud pies', throw mud at each other and play
      barefoot and cover their bare feet in mud and/or coat themselves in mud.
    * Albuquerque and other towns across the United_States such as Gillette,
      Wyoming hold a yearly event in which participants play volleyball in a
      giant mud pit.
