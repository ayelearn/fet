For its application to music, see Counting_(music).
Counting is the process of determining the number of elements of a finite_set
of objects. The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing
a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some
order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same
element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was
set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object
gives the desired number of elements. The related term enumeration refers to
uniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite
set by assigning a number to each element.
Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting
money, counting out change, "counting by twos" (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...), or
"counting by fives" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).
There is archaeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for
at least 50,000 years.[1] Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to
keep track of social and economic data such as number of group members, prey
animals, property, or debts (i.e., accountancy). Notched bones were also found
in the Border Caves in South Africa that may suggest that the concept of
counting was known to humans as far back as 44,000 BCE.[2] The development of
counting led to the development of mathematical_notation, numeral_systems, and
writing.

***** Forms of counting[edit] *****

Counting can occur in a variety of forms.
Counting can be verbal; that is, speaking every number out loud (or mentally)
to keep track of progress. This is often used to count objects that are present
already, instead of counting a variety of things over time.
Counting can also be in the form of tally_marks, making a mark for each number
and then counting all of the marks when done tallying. This is useful when
counting objects over time, such as the number of times something occurs during
the course of a day. Tallying is base 1 counting; normal counting is done in
base 10. Computers use base 2 counting (0s and 1s).
Counting can also be in the form of finger_counting, especially when counting
small numbers. This is often used by children to facilitate counting and simple
mathematical operations. Finger-counting uses unary notation (one finger = one
unit), and is thus limited to counting 10 (unless you start in with your toes).
Older finger counting used the four fingers and the three bones in each finger
(phalanges) to count to the number twelve.[3] Other hand-gesture systems are
also in use, for example the Chinese system by which one can count to 10 using
only gestures of one hand. By using finger_binary (base 2 counting), it is
possible to keep a finger count up to 1023 = 210 â 1.
Various devices can also be used to facilitate counting, such as hand tally
counters and abacuses.
***** Inclusive counting[edit] *****
Inclusive counting is usually encountered when dealing with time in the Romance
languages.[4] In exclusive counting languages such as English, when counting
"8" days from_Sunday, Monday will be day 1, Tuesday day 2, and the following
Monday will be the eighth day. When counting "inclusively," the Sunday (the
start day) will be day 1 and therefore the following Sunday will be the eighth
day. For example, the French phrase for "fortnight" is quinzaine (15 [days]),
and similar words are present in Greek (Î´ÎµÎºÎ±ÏÎµÎ½Î¸Î®Î¼ÎµÏÎ¿,
dekapenthÃ­mero), Spanish (quincena) and Portuguese (quinzena). In contrast,
the English word "fortnight" itself derives from "a fourteen-night", as the
archaic "sennight" does from "a seven-night"; the English words are not
examples of inclusive counting.
Names based on inclusive counting appear in other calendars as well: in the
Roman calendar the nones (meaning "nine") is 8 days before the ides; and in the
Christian calendar Quinquagesima (meaning 50) is 49 days before Easter Sunday.
Musical terminology also uses inclusive counting of intervals between notes of
the standard scale: going up one note is a second interval, going up two notes
is a third interval, etc., and going up seven notes is an octave.
***** Education and development[edit] *****
Main article: Pre-math_skills
Learning to count is an important educational/developmental milestone in most
cultures of the world. Learning to count is a child's very first step into
mathematics, and constitutes the most fundamental idea of that discipline.
However, some cultures in Amazonia and the Australian Outback do not count,[5]
[6] and their languages do not have number words.
Many children at just 2 years of age have some skill in reciting the count list
(i.e., saying "one, two, three, ..."). They can also answer questions of
ordinality for small numbers, e.g., "What comes after three?". They can even be
skilled at pointing to each object in a set and reciting the words one after
another. This leads many parents and educators to the conclusion that the child
knows how to use counting to determine the size of a set.[7] Research suggests
that it takes about a year after learning these skills for a child to
understand what they mean and why the procedures are performed.[8][9] In the
meantime, children learn how to name cardinalities that they can subitize.
***** Counting in mathematics[edit] *****
In mathematics, the essence of counting a set and finding a result n, is that
it establishes a one-to-one_correspondence (or bijection) of the set with the
set of numbers {1, 2, ..., n}. A fundamental fact, which can be proved by
mathematical_induction, is that no bijection can exist between {1, 2, ..., n}
and {1, 2, ..., m} unless n = m; this fact (together with the fact that two
bijections can be composed to give another bijection) ensures that counting the
same set in different ways can never result in different numbers (unless an
error is made). This is the fundamental mathematical theorem that gives
counting its purpose; however you count a (finite) set, the answer is the same.
In a broader context, the theorem is an example of a theorem in the
mathematical field of (finite) combinatoricsâhence (finite) combinatorics is
sometimes referred to as "the mathematics of counting."
Many sets that arise in mathematics do not allow a bijection to be established
with {1, 2, ..., n} for any natural_number n; these are called infinite_sets,
while those sets for which such a bijection does exist (for some n) are called
finite_sets. Infinite sets cannot be counted in the usual sense; for one thing,
the mathematical theorems which underlie this usual sense for finite sets are
false for infinite sets. Furthermore, different definitions of the concepts in
terms of which these theorems are stated, while equivalent for finite sets, are
inequivalent in the context of infinite sets.
The notion of counting may be extended to them in the sense of establishing
(the existence of) a bijection with some well-understood set. For instance, if
a set can be brought into bijection with the set of all natural numbers, then
it is called "countably_infinite." This kind of counting differs in a
fundamental way from counting of finite sets, in that adding new elements to a
set does not necessarily increase its size, because the possibility of a
bijection with the original set is not excluded. For instance, the set of all
integers (including negative numbers) can be brought into bijection with the
set of natural numbers, and even seemingly much larger sets like that of all
finite sequences of rational numbers are still (only) countably infinite.
Nevertheless, there are sets, such as the set of real_numbers, that can be
shown to be "too large" to admit a bijection with the natural numbers, and
these sets are called "uncountable." Sets for which there exists a bijection
between them are said to have the same cardinality, and in the most general
sense counting a set can be taken to mean determining its cardinality. Beyond
the cardinalities given by each of the natural numbers, there is an infinite
hierarchy of infinite cardinalities, although only very few such cardinalities
occur in ordinary mathematics (that is, outside set_theory that explicitly
studies possible cardinalities).
Counting, mostly of finite sets, has various applications in mathematics. One
important principle is that if two sets X and Y have the same finite number of
elements, and a function f: X â Y is known to be injective, then it is also
surjective, and vice versa. A related fact is known as the pigeonhole
principle, which states that if two sets X and Y have finite numbers of
elements n and m with n > m, then any map f: X â Y is not injective (so there
exist two distinct elements of X that f sends to the same element of Y); this
follows from the former principle, since if f were injective, then so would its
restriction to a strict subset S of X with m elements, which restriction would
then be surjective, contradicting the fact that for x in X outside S, f(x)
cannot be in the image of the restriction. Similar counting arguments can prove
the existence of certain objects without explicitly providing an example. In
the case of infinite sets this can even apply in situations where it is
impossible to give an example.[citation_needed]
The domain of enumerative_combinatorics deals with computing the number of
elements of finite sets, without actually counting them; the latter usually
being impossible because infinite families of finite sets are considered at
once, such as the set of permutations of {1, 2, ..., n} for any natural number
n.
