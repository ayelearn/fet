***** Etymology[edit] *****
The word "biomechanics" (1899) and the related "biomechanical" (1856) come from
the Ancient_Greek Î²Î¯Î¿Ï bios "life" and Î¼Î·ÏÎ±Î½Î¹ÎºÎ®, mÄchanikÄ
"mechanics", to refer to the study of the mechanical principles of living
organisms, particularly their movement and structure.[3]
***** Subfields[edit] *****
**** Biofluid mechanics[edit] ****
Red_blood_cells
Biological fluid mechanics, or biofluid mechanics, is the study of both gas and
liquid fluid flows in or around biological organisms. An often studied liquid
biofluids problem is that of blood flow in the human cardiovascular system.
Under certain mathematical circumstances, blood flow can be modelled by the
NavierâStokes_equations. In vivo whole_blood is assumed to be an
incompressible Newtonian_fluid. However, this assumption fails when considering
forward flow within arterioles. At the microscopic scale, the effects of
individual red_blood_cells become significant, and whole blood can no longer be
modelled as a continuum. When the diameter of the blood vessel is just slightly
larger than the diameter of the red blood cell the FahraeusâLindquist_effect
occurs and there is a decrease in wall shear_stress. However, as the diameter
of the blood vessel decreases further, the red blood cells have to squeeze
through the vessel and often can only pass in single file. In this case, the
inverse FahraeusâLindquist effect occurs and the wall shear stress increases.
An example of a gaseous biofluids problem is that of human respiration.
Recently, respiratory systems in insects have been studied for bioinspiration
for designing improved microfluidic devices.[4]
**** Biotribology[edit] ****
The main aspects of Contact_mechanics and tribology are related to friction,
wear and lubrication. When the two surfaces come in contact during motion i.e.
rub against each other, friction, wear and lubrication effects are very
important to analyze in order to determine the performance of the material.
Biotribology is a study of friction, wear and lubrication of biological systems
especially human joints such as hips and knees.[5] For example, femoral and
tibial components of knee implant routinely rub against each other during daily
activity such as walking or stair climbing. If the performance of tibial
component needs to be analyzed, the principles of biotribology are used to
determine the wear performance of the implant and lubrication effects of
synovial fluid. In addition, the theory of contact_mechanics also becomes very
important for wear analysis. Additional aspects of biotribology can also
include analysis of subsurface damage resulting from two surfaces coming in
contact during motion, i.e. rubbing against each other, such as in the
evaluation of tissue engineered cartilage.[6]
**** Comparative biomechanics[edit] ****
Chinstrap_penguin leaping over water
Comparative biomechanics is the application of biomechanics to non-human
organisms, whether used to gain greater insights into humans (as in physical
anthropology) or into the functions, ecology and adaptations of the organisms
themselves. Common areas of investigation are Animal_locomotion and feeding, as
these have strong connections to the organism's fitness and impose high
mechanical demands. Animal locomotion, has many manifestations, including
running, jumping and flying. Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction,
drag, inertia, and gravity, though which factor predominates varies with
environment.[citation_needed]
Comparative biomechanics overlaps strongly with many other fields, including
ecology, neurobiology, developmental_biology, ethology, and paleontology, to
the extent of commonly publishing papers in the journals of these other fields.
Comparative biomechanics is often applied in medicine (with regards to common
model organisms such as mice and rats) as well as in biomimetics, which looks
to nature for solutions to engineering problems.[citation_needed]
**** Computational biomechanics[edit] ****
Computational biomechanics is the application of engineering computational
tools, such as the Finite_element_method to study the mechanics of biological
systems. Computational models and simulations are used to predict the
relationship between parameters that are otherwise challenging to test
experimentally, or used to design more relevant experiments reducing the time
and costs of experiments. Mechanical modeling using finite element analysis has
been used to interpret the experimental observation of plant cell growth to
understand how they differentiate, for instance.[7] In medicine, over the past
decade, the Finite_element_method has become an established alternative to in
vivo surgical assessment. One of the main advantages of computational
biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of
an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.[8] This has led FE
modeling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics
while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g.
BioSpine).
**** Continuum biomechanics[edit] ****
The mechanical analysis of biomaterials and biofluids is usually carried forth
with the concepts of continuum_mechanics. This assumption breaks down when the
length_scales of interest approach the order of the micro structural details of
the material. One of the most remarkable characteristic of biomaterials is
their hierarchical structure. In other words, the mechanical characteristics of
these materials rely on physical phenomena occurring in multiple levels, from
the molecular all the way up to the tissue and organ levels.[citation_needed]
Biomaterials are classified in two groups, hard and soft_tissues. Mechanical
deformation of hard tissues (like wood, shell and bone) may be analysed with
the theory of linear_elasticity. On the other hand, soft tissues (like skin,
tendon, muscle and cartilage) usually undergo large deformations and thus their
analysis rely on the finite_strain_theory and computer_simulations. The
interest in continuum biomechanics is spurred by the need for realism in the
development of medical simulation.[9]:568
**** Plant biomechanics[edit] ****
The application of biomechanical principles to plants, plant organs and cells
has developed into the subfield of plant biomechanics.[10] Application of
biomechanics for plants ranges from studying the resilience of crops to
environmental stress[11] to development and morphogenesis at cell and tissue
scale, overlapping with mechanobiology.[7]
**** Sports biomechanics[edit] ****
Main article: Sports_biomechanics
In sports biomechanics, the laws of mechanics are applied to human movement in
order to gain a greater understanding of athletic performance and to reduce
sport_injuries as well. It focuses on the application of the scientific
principles of mechanical physics to understand movements of action of human
bodies and sports implements such as cricket bat, hockey stick and javelin etc.
Elements of mechanical_engineering (e.g., strain_gauges), electrical
engineering (e.g., digital_filtering), computer_science (e.g., numerical
methods), gait_analysis (e.g., force_platforms), and clinical_neurophysiology
(e.g., surface_EMG) are common methods used in sports biomechanics.[12]
Biomechanics in sports can be stated as the muscular, joint and skeletal
actions of the body during the execution of a given task, skill and/or
technique. Proper understanding of biomechanics relating to sports skill has
the greatest implications on: sport's performance, rehabilitation and injury
prevention, along with sport mastery. As noted by Doctor Michael Yessis, one
could say that best athlete is the one that executes his or her skill the best.

***** History[edit] *****
**** Antiquity[edit] ****
Aristotle, a student of Plato can be considered the first bio-mechanic, because
of his work with animal anatomy. Aristotle wrote the first book on the motion
of animals, De_Motu_Animalium, or On_the_Movement_of_Animals.[14] He not only
saw animals' bodies as mechanical systems, but pursued questions such as the
physiological difference between imagining performing an action and actually
doing it.[15] In another work, On_the_Parts_of_Animals, he provided an accurate
description of how the ureter uses peristalsis to carry urine from the kidneys
to the bladder.[9]:2
With the rise of the Roman_Empire, technology became more popular than
philosophy and the next bio-mechanic arose. Galen (129 AD-210 AD), physician to
Marcus_Aurelius, wrote his famous work, On the Function of the Parts (about the
human body). This would be the world's standard medical book for the next 1,400
years.[16]
**** Renaissance[edit] ****
The next major biomechanic would not be around until 1452, with the birth of
Leonardo_da_Vinci. Da Vinci was an artist and mechanic and engineer. He
contributed to mechanics and military and civil engineering projects. He had a
great understanding of science and mechanics and studied anatomy in a mechanics
context. He analyzed muscle forces and movements and studied joint functions.
These studies could be considered studies in the realm of biomechanics.
Leonardo_da_Vinci studied anatomy in the context of mechanics. He analyzed
muscle forces as acting along lines connecting origins and insertions, and
studied joint function. Da Vinci tended to mimic some animal features in his
machines. For example, he studied the flight of birds to find means by which
humans could fly; and because horses were the principal source of mechanical
power in that time, he studied their muscular systems to design machines that
would better benefit from the forces applied by this animal.[17]
In 1543, Galen's work, On the Function of the Parts was challenged by Andreas
Vesalius at the age of 29. Vesalius published his own work called, On the
Structure of the Human Body. In this work, Vesalius corrected many errors made
by Galen, which would not be globally accepted for many centuries. With the
death of Copernicus came a new desire to understand and learn about the world
around people and how it works. On his deathbed, he published his work, On the
Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres. This work not only revolutionized science
and physics, but also the development of mechanics and later bio-mechanics.[16]
Galileo_Galilee, the father of mechanics and part time biomechanic was born 21
years after the death of Copernicus. Galileo spent many years in medical school
and often questioned everything his professors taught. He found that the
professors could not prove what they taught so he moved onto mathematics where
everything had to be proven. Then, at the age of 25, he went to Pisa and taught
mathematics. He was a very good lecturer and students would leave their other
instructors to hear him speak, so he was forced to resign. He then became a
professor at an even more prestigious school in Padua. His spirit and teachings
would lead the world once again in the direction of science. Over his years of
science, Galileo made a lot of biomechanical aspects known. For example, he
discovered that  "animals' masses increase disproportionately to their size,
and their bones must consequently also disproportionately increase in girth,
adapting to loadbearing rather than mere size. [The bending strength of a
tubular structure such as a bone is increased relative to its weight by making
it hollow and increasing its diameter. Marine animals can be larger than
terrestrial animals because the water's buoyancy [sic] relieves their tissues
of weight."[16]
Galileo_Galilei was interested in the strength of bones and suggested that
bones are hollow because this affords maximum strength with minimum weight. He
noted that animals' bone masses increased disproportionately to their size.
Consequently, bones must also increase disproportionately in girth rather than
mere size. This is because the bending strength of a tubular structure (such as
a bone) is much more efficient relative to its weight. Mason suggests that this
insight was one of the first grasps of the principles of biological
optimization.[17]
In the 16th century, Descartes suggested a philosophic system whereby all
living systems, including the human body (but not the soul), are simply
machines ruled by the same mechanical laws, an idea that did much to promote
and sustain biomechanical study. Giovanni_Alfonso_Borelli embraced this idea
and studied walking, running, jumping, the flight of birds, the swimming of
fish, and even the piston action of the heart within a mechanical framework. He
could determine the position of the human center_of_gravity, calculate and
measured inspired and expired air volumes, and showed that inspiration is
muscle-driven and expiration is due to tissue elasticity. Borelli was the first
to understand that the levers of the musculoskeletal system magnify motion
rather than force, so that muscles must produce much larger forces than those
resisting the motion. Influenced by the work of Galileo, whom he personally
knew, he had an intuitive understanding of static equilibrium in various joints
of the human body well before Newton published the laws of motion.[18]
**** Industrial era[edit] ****
The next major bio-mechanic, Giovanni_Alfonso_Borelli, was the first to
understand that âthe levers of the musculature system magnify motion rather
than force, so that muscles must produce much larger forces than those
resisting the motionâ.[16] Using the works of Galileo and building off from
them, Borelli figured out the forces required for equilibrium in various joints
of the human body. He even discovered the human center of gravity and air
volume as well as  muscle elasticity. His work is often considered the most
important in the history of bio-mechanics because he made so many new
discoveries that opened the way for the future generations to continue his work
and studies.
It was many years after Borelli before the field of bio-mechanics made any
major leaps. After that time, more and more scientists took to learning about
the human body and its functions. There are not many notable scientists from
the 19th or 20th century in bio-mechanics because the field is far too vast now
to attribute one thing to one person. However, the field is continuing to grow
every year and continues to make advances in discovering more about the human
body. Because the field became so popular, many institutions and labs have
opened over the last century and people continue doing research. With the
Creation of the American Society of Bio-mechanics in 1977, the field continues
to grow and make many new discoveries.[16]
In the 19th century Ãtienne-Jules_Marey used cinematography to scientifically
investigate locomotion. He opened the field of modern 'motion analysis' by
being the first to correlate ground reaction forces with movement. In Germany,
the brothers Ernst_Heinrich_Weber and Wilhelm_Eduard_Weber hypothesized a great
deal about human gait, but it was Christian_Wilhelm_Braune who significantly
advanced the science using recent advances in engineering mechanics. During the
same period, the engineering mechanics_of_materials began to flourish in France
and Germany under the demands of the industrial_revolution. This led to the
rebirth of bone biomechanics when the railroad_engineer Karl_Culmann and the
anatomist Hermann_von_Meyer compared the stress patterns in a human femur with
those in a similarly shaped crane. Inspired by this finding Julius_Wolff
proposed the famous Wolff's_law of bone_remodeling.[19]
***** Applications[edit] *****
The study of biomechanics ranges from the inner workings of a cell to the
movement and development of limbs, to the mechanical properties of soft_tissue,
[6] and bones. Some simple examples of biomechanics research include the
investigation of the forces that act on limbs, the aerodynamics of bird and
insect flight, the hydrodynamics of swimming in fish, and locomotion in general
across all forms of life, from individual cells to whole organisms. With
growing understanding of the physiological behavior of living tissues,
researchers are able to advance the field of tissue_engineering, as well as
develop improved treatments for a wide array of pathologies including cancer.
[20][citation_needed]
Biomechanics is also applied to studying human musculoskeletal systems. Such
research utilizes force platforms to study human ground reaction forces and
infrared videography to capture the trajectories of markers attached to the
human body to study human 3D motion. Research also applies electromyography to
study muscle activation, investigating muscle responses to external forces and
perturbations.[21]
Biomechanics is widely used in orthopedic industry to design orthopedic
implants for human joints, dental parts, external fixations and other medical
purposes. Biotribology is a very important part of it. It is a study of the
performance and function of biomaterials used for orthopedic implants. It plays
a vital role to improve the design and produce successful biomaterials for
medical and clinical purposes. One such example is in tissue engineered
cartilage.[6]

It is also tied to the field of engineering, because it often uses traditional
engineering sciences to analyze biological_systems. Some simple applications of
Newtonian_mechanics and/or materials_sciences can supply correct approximations
to the mechanics of many biological_systems. Applied mechanics, most notably
mechanical_engineering disciplines such as continuum_mechanics, mechanism
analysis, structural analysis, kinematics and dynamics play prominent roles in
the study of biomechanics.[22]
A ribosome is a biological_machine that utilizes protein_dynamics
Usually biological systems are much more complex than man-built systems.
Numerical_methods are hence applied in almost every biomechanical study.
Research is done in an iterative process of hypothesis and verification,
including several steps of modeling, computer_simulation and experimental
measurements.
