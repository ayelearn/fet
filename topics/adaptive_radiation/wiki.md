In evolutionary_biology, adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms
diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms,
particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available,
creates new challenges, or opens new environmental niches.[1][2] Starting with
a recent single ancestor, this process results in the speciation and phenotypic
adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and
physiological traits. The prototypical example of adaptive radiation is finch
speciation on the Galapagos ("Darwin's_finches"), but examples are known from
around the world.

***** Characteristics[edit] *****
Four features can be used to identify an adaptive radiation:[2]
   1. A common ancestry of component species: specifically a recent ancestry.
      Note that this is not the same as a monophyly in which all descendants of
      a common ancestor are included.
   2. A phenotype-environment correlation: a significant association between
      environments and the morphological and physiological traits used to
      exploit those environments.
   3. Trait utility: the performance or fitness advantages of trait values in
      their corresponding environments.
   4. Rapid speciation: presence of one or more bursts in the emergence of new
      species around the time that ecological and phenotypic divergence is
      underway.
***** Conditions[edit] *****
Adaptive radiation tends to take place under the following conditions:[3]
   1. A new habitat has opened up: a volcano, for example, can create new
      ground in the middle of the ocean. This is the case in places like Hawaii
      and the Galapagos. For aquatic species, the formation of a large new lake
      habitat could serve the same purpose; the tectonic movement that formed
      the East African Rift, ultimately leading to the creation of the Rift
      Valley Lakes, is an example of this. An extinction event could
      effectively achieve this same result, opening up niches that were
      previously occupied by species that no longer exist.
   2. This new habitat is relatively isolated. When a volcano erupts on the
      mainland and destroys an adjacent forest, it is likely that the
      terrestrial plant and animal species that used to live in the destroyed
      region will recolonize without evolving greatly. However, if a newly
      formed habitat is isolated, the species that colonize it will likely be
      somewhat random and uncommon arrivals.
   3. The new habitat has a wide availability of niche space. The rare colonist
      can only adaptively radiate into as many forms as there are niches.
***** Examples[edit] *****
**** Darwin's finches[edit] ****
Darwin's finches are an often-used textbook example of adaptive radiation.
Today represented by approximately 15 species, Darwin's finches are Galapagos
endemics famously adapted for a specialized feeding behavior (although one
species, the Cocos finch (Pinaroloxias_inornata), is not found in the Galapagos
but on the island of Cocos south of Costa Rica).[4] Darwin's finches are not
actually finches in the true sense, but are members of the tanager family
Thraupidae, and are derived from a single ancestor that arrived in the
Galapagos from mainland South America perhaps just 3 million years ago.[5]
Excluding the Cocos finch, each species of Darwin's finch is generally widely
distributed in the Galapagos and fills the same niche on each island. For the
ground finches, this niche is a diet of seeds, and they have thick bills to
facilitate the consumption of these hard materials.[4] The ground finches are
further specialized to eat seeds of a particular size: the large ground finch
(Geospiza_magnirostris) is the largest species of Darwin's finch and has the
thickest beak for breaking open the toughest seeds, the small ground finch
(Geospiza_fuliginosa) has a smaller beak for eating smaller seeds, and the
medium ground finch (Geospiza_fortis) has a beak of intermediate size for
optimal consumption of intermediately sized seeds (relative to G. magnirostris
and G. fuliginosa).[4] There is some overlap: for example, the most robust
medium ground finches could have beaks larger than those of the smallest large
ground finches.[4] Because of this overlap, it can be difficult to tell the
species apart by eye, though their songs differ.[4] These three species often
occur sympatrically, and during the rainy season in the Galapagos when food is
plentiful, they specialize little and eat the same, easily accessible foods.[4]
It was not well-understood why their beaks were so adapted until Peter_and
Rosemary_Grant studied their feeding behavior in the long dry season, and
discovered that when food is scarce, the ground finches use their specialized
beaks to eat the seeds that they are best suited to eat and thus avoid
starvation.[4]
The other finches in the Galapagos are similarly uniquely adapted for their
particular niche. The cactus finches (Geospiza sp.) have somewhat longer beaks
than the ground finches that serve the dual purpose of allowing them to feed on
Opuntia cactus nectar and pollen while these plants are flowering, but on seeds
during the rest of the year.[4] The warbler-finches (Certhidea sp.) have short,
pointed beaks for eating insects.[4] The woodpecker finch (Camarhynchus
pallidus) has a slender beak which it uses to pick at wood in search of
insects; it also uses small sticks to reach insect prey inside the wood, making
it one of the few animals that use tools.[4]
The mechanism by which the finches initially diversified is still an area of
active research. One proposition is that the finches were able to have a non-
adaptive, allopatric speciation event on separate islands in the archipelago,
such that when they reconverged on some islands, they were able to maintain
reproductive isolation.[5] Once they occurred in sympatry, niche specialization
was favored so that the different species competed less directly for resources.
[5] This second, sympatric event was adaptive radiation.[5]
**** Cichlids of the African Great Lakes[edit] ****
The haplochromine cichlid fishes in the Great_Lakes of the East_African_Rift
(particularly in Lake_Tanganyika, Lake_Malawi, and Lake_Victoria) form the most
speciose modern example of adaptive radiation.[6][7][8] These lakes are
believed to be home to about 2,000 different species of cichlid, spanning a
wide range of ecological roles and morphological characteristics.[9] Cichlids
in these lakes fill nearly all of the roles typically filled by a large number
of fish families, including those of predators, scavengers, and herbivores,
with varying dentitions and head shapes to match their dietary habits.[8] In
each case, the radiation events are only a few million years old, making the
very high level of speciation particularly remarkable.[8][7][6] Several factors
could be responsible for this diversity: the availability of a multitude of
niches probably favored specialization, as few other fish taxa are present in
the lakes (meaning that sympatric speciation was the most probable mechanism
for initial specialization).[6] Also, continual changes in the water level of
the lakes during the Pleistocene (which often turned the largest lakes into
several smaller ones) could have created the conditions for secondary
allopatric speciation.[8][6]
*** Tanganyika cichlids[edit] ***
Lake Tanganyika is the site from which nearly all the cichlid lineages of East
Africa (including both riverine and lake species) originated.[10] Thus, the
species in the lake constitute a single adaptive radiation event but do not
form a single monophyletic clade.[10] Lake Tanganyika is also the least
speciose of the three largest African Great Lakes, with only around 200 species
of cichlid;[7] however, these cichlids are more morphologically divergent and
ecologically distinct than their counterparts in lakes Malawi and Victoria, an
artifact of Lake Tanganyika's older cichlid fauna. Lake Tanganyika itself is
believed to have formed 9-12 million years ago, putting a recent cap on the age
of the lake's cichlid fauna.[7] Many of Tanganyika's cichlids live very
specialized lifestyles. The giant or emperor cichlid (Boulengerochromis
microlepis) is a piscivore often ranked the largest of all cichlids (though it
competes for this title with South America's Cichla_temensis, the speckled
peacock bass).[7] It is thought that giant cichlids spawn only a single time,
breeding in their third year and defending their young until they reach a large
size, before dying of starvation some time thereafter.[7] The three species of
Altolamprologus are also piscivores, but with laterally compressed bodies and
thick scales enabling them to chase prey into thin cracks in rocks without
damaging their skin.[7] Plecodus_straeleni has evolved large, strangely curved
teeth that are designed to scrape scales off of the sides of other fish, scales
being its main source of food.[7] Gnathochromis_permaxillaris possesses a large
mouth with a protruding upper lip, and feeds by opening this mouth downward
onto the sandy lake bottom, sucking in small invertebrates.[7] A number of
Tanganyika's cichlids are shell-brooders, meaning that mating pairs lay and
fertilize their eggs inside of empty shells on the lake bottom.[7] Lamprologus
callipterus is the most unique egg-brooding species, with 15 cm-long males
amassing collections of shells and guarding them in the hopes of attracting
females (about 6 cm in length) to lay eggs in these shells.[7] These dominant
males must defend their territories from three types of rival: (1) other
dominant males looking to steal shells; (2) younger, "sneaker" males looking to
fertilize eggs in a dominant male's territory; and (3) tiny, 2â4 cm
"parasitic dwarf" males that also attempt to rush in and fertilize eggs in the
dominant male's territory.[7] These parasitic dwarf males never grow to the
size of dominant males, and the male offspring of dominant and parasitic dwarf
males grow with 100% fidelity into the form of their fathers.[7] A number of
other highly specialized Tanganyika cichlids exist aside from these examples,
including those adapted for life in open lake water up to 200m deep.[7]
*** Malawi cichlids[edit] ***
The cichlids of Lake Malawi constitute a "species flock" of up to 1000 endemic
species.[8] Only seven cichlid species in Lake Malawi are not a part of the
species flock: the Eastern happy (Astatotilapia_calliptera), the sungwa
(Serranochromis_robustus), and five tilapia species (genera Oreochromis and
Coptodon).[8] All of the other cichlid species in the lake are descendants of a
single original colonist species, which itself was descended from Tanganyikan
ancestors.[10] The common ancestor of Malawi's species flock is believed to
have reached the lake 3.4 million years ago at the earliest, making Malawi
cichlids' diversification into their present numbers particularly rapid.[8]
Malawi's cichlids span a similarly range of feeding behaviors to those of
Tanganyika, but also show signs of a much more recent origin. For example, all
members of the Malawi species flock are mouth-brooders, meaning the female
keeps her eggs in her mouth until they hatch; in almost all species, the eggs
are also fertilized in the female's mouth, and in a few species, the females
continue to guard their fry in their mouth after they hatch.[8] Males of most
species display predominantly blue coloration when mating. However, a number of
particularly divergent species are known from Malawi, including the piscivorous
Nimbochromis_livingtonii, which lies on its side in the substrate until small
cichlids, perhaps drawn to its broken white patterning, come to inspect the
predator - at which point they are swiftly eaten.[8]
*** Victoria cichlids[edit] ***
Lake Victoria's cichlids are also a species flock, once composed of some 500 or
more species.[6] The deliberate introduction of the Nile Perch (Lates
niloticus) in the 1950s proved disastrous for Victoria cichlids, and the
collective biomass of the Victoria cichlid species flock has decreased
substantially and an unknown number of species have become extinct.[11]
However, the original range of morphological and behavioral diversity seen in
the lake's cichlid fauna is still mostly present today, if endangered.[6] These
again include cichlids specialized for niches across the trophic spectrum, as
in Tanganyika and Malawi, but again, there are standouts. Victoria is famously
home to a large number of piscivorous cichlid species, some of which feed by
sucking the contents out of mouthbrooding females' mouths.[11] Victoria's
cichlids constitute a far younger radiation than even that of Lake Malawi, with
estimates of the age of the flock ranging from 200,000 years to as little as
14,000.[6]
**** Adaptive radiation in Hawaii[edit] ****
An Ê»iÊ»iwi (Drepanis coccinea). Note the long, curved beak for sipping nectar
from tubular flowers.
Hawaii has served as the site of a number of adaptive radiation events, owing
to its isolation, recent origin, and large land area. The three most famous
examples of these radiations are presented below, though insects like the
Hawaiian drosophilid flies and Hyposmocoma moths have also undergone adaptive
radiation.[12][13]
*** Hawaiian honeycreepers[edit] ***
The Hawaiian_honeycreepers form a large, highly morphologically diverse species
group that began radiating in the early days of the Hawaiian archipelago. While
today only 17 species are known to persist in Hawaii (3 more may or may not be
extinct), there were more than 50 species prior to Polynesian colonization of
the archipelago (between 18 and 21 species have gone extinct since the
discovery of the islands by westerners). The Hawaiian honeycreepers are known
for their beaks, which are specialized to satisfy a wide range of dietary
needs: for example, the beak of the Ê»akiapÅlÄÊ»au (Hemignathus_wilsoni) is
characterized by a short, sharp lower mandible for scraping bark off of trees,
and the much longer, curved upper mandible is used to probe the wood underneath
for insects.[4] Meanwhile, the Ê»iÊ»iwi (Drepanis_coccinea) has a very long
curved beak for reaching nectar deep in Lobelia flowers.[12] An entire clade of
Hawaiian honeycreepers, the tribe Psittirostrini, is composed of thick-billed,
mostly seed-eating birds, like the Laysan finch (Telespiza_cantans).[12] In at
least some cases, similar morphologies and behaviors appear to have evolved
convergently among the Hawaiian honeycreepers; for example, the short, pointed
beaks of Loxops and Oreomystis evolved separately despite once forming the
justification for lumping the two genera together.[14] The Hawaiian
honeycreepers are believed to have descended from a single common ancestor some
15 to 20 million years ago, though estimates range as low as 3.5 million years.
[15]
*** Hawaiian silverswords[edit] ***
A mixture of blooming and non-blooming HaleakalÄ silverswords (Argyroxiphium
sandwicense macrocephalum).
Adaptive radiation is not a strictly vertebrate phenomenon, and examples are
also known from among plants. The most famous example of adaptive radiation in
plants is quite possibly the Hawaiian silverswords, named for alpine desert-
dwelling Argyroxiphium species with long, silvery leaves that live for up to 20
years before growing a single flowering stalk and then dying.[12] The Hawaiian
silversword_alliance consists of twenty-eight species of Hawaiian plants which,
aside from the namesake silverswords, includes trees, shrubs, vines, cushion
plants, and more.[15] The silversword alliance is believed to have originated
in Hawaii no more than 6 million years ago, making this one of Hawaii's
youngest adaptive radiation events.[15] This means that the silverswords
evolved on Hawaii's modern high islands, and descended from a single common
ancestor that arrived on Kauai from western North America.[15] The closest
modern relatives of the silverswords today are California tarweeds of the
family Asteraceae.[15]
*** Hawaiian lobelioids[edit] ***
Hawaii is also the site of a separate major floral adaptive radiation event:
the Hawaiian_lobelioids. The Hawaiian lobelioids are significantly more
speciose than the silverswords, perhaps because they have been present in
Hawaii for so much longer: they descended from a single common ancestor who
arrived in the archipelago up to 15 million years ago.[15] Today the Hawaiian
lobelioids form a clade of over 125 species, including succulents, trees,
shrubs, epiphytes, etc. A large number of species have been lost to extinction
and many of the surviving species endangered.
**** Caribbean anoles[edit] ****
Anole lizards are distributed broadly in the New World, from the Southeastern
US to South America. With over 400 species currently recognized, often placed
in a single genus (Anolis), they constitute one of the largest radiation events
among all lizards.[16] Anole radiation on the mainland has largely been a
process of speciation, and is not adaptive to any great degree, but anoles on
each of the Greater_Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto_Rico, and Jamaica) have
adaptively radiated in separate, convergent ways.[17] On each of these islands,
anoles have evolved with such a consistent set of morphological adaptations
that each species can be assigned to one of six "ecomorphs": trunkâground,
trunkâcrown, grassâbush, crownâgiant, twig, and trunk.[17] Take, for
example, crownâgiants from each of these islands: the Cuban Anolis
luteogularis, Hispaniola's Anolis_ricordii, Puerto Rico's Anolis_cuvieri, and
Jamaica's Anolis_garmani (Cuba and Hispaniola are both home to more than one
species of crownâgiant).[16] These anoles are all large, canopy-dwelling
species with large heads and large lamellae (scales on the undersides of the
fingers and toes that are important for traction in climbing), and yet none of
these species are particularly closely related and appear to have evolved these
similar traits independently.[16] The same can be said of the other five
ecomorphs across the Caribbean's four largest islands. Much like in the case of
the cichlids of the three largest African Great Lakes, each of these islands is
home to its own convergent Anolis adaptive radiation event.
**** Other examples[edit] ****
Presented above are the most well-documented examples of modern adaptive
radiation, but other examples are known. On Madagascar, birds of the family
Vangidae are marked by very distinct beak shapes to suit their ecological
roles.[18] Madagascan mantellid frogs have radiated into forms that mirror
other tropical frog faunas, with the brightly colored mantellas (Mantella)
having evolved convergently with the Neotropical poison dart frogs of
Dendrobatidae, while the arboreal Boophis species are the Madagascan equivalent
of tree_frogs and glass_frogs. The pseudoxyrhophiine snakes of Madagascar have
evolved into fossorial, arboreal, terrestrial, and semi-aquatic forms that
converge with the colubroid faunas in the rest of the world. These Madagascan
examples are significantly older than most of the other examples presented
here: Madagascar's fauna has been evolving in isolation since the island split
from India some 88 million years ago, and the Mantellidae originated around 50
mya.[19][20] Older examples are known: the K-Pg extinction event, which caused
the disappearance of the dinosaurs and most other reptilian megafauna 65
million years ago, is seen as having triggered a global adaptive radiation
event that created the mammal diversity that exists today.[3]
