Heat setting is a term used in the textile_industry to describe a thermal
process usually taking place in either a steam atmosphere or a dry_heat
environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric
dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher
volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, heat setting
is also used to improve attributes for subsequent processes.
Heat setting can eliminate the tendency of undesirable torquing. At the
winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, the increased
tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using
heat setting for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the
diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber
thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results
of the heat setting process. Heat setting benefits staple yarns as well as
bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. Heat setting often causes synthetic
fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as
"bulk development". All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give
textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as heat setting. The
term "thermal fixation" is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the
process is exclusively called "heat setting".

***** Crinkling tendency[edit] *****
The crinkle tendency is due to the technological conditions of the spun yarn
production and the physical fiber properties. Above all, the "technological
conditions of the spun yarn production" means the turning moment of the thread.
A twisted thread will always try to twist when it hangs freely between two
fixed points in the form of a loop. In doing this, it gives up a part of its
original twist which becomes spirals whose twisting direction is opposite to
the original twist direction. This development of twist in the opposite
direction occurs as the twisted yarn attempts to reach equilibrium.
diagram by MÃ¼ller
Twisting in the opposite direction is due to the tensions resulting from the
yarn twisting that Mueller indicated in the diagram of tension and pressure.
The total tension acting against the twisting is increased in relation to
increased twisting due to the increasing tension and pressure of the bundle of
fibres in the yarn. It may become so strong that the thread core buckles when
it can no longer withstand the compressive strains. The yarn curls, meaning
that the yarn tries to reach a state of equilibrium in which twists in the
opposite direction from the original twist direction balance the yarn's
torque.These twists are also called negative twists. In this state of
equilibrium, the inner torsional tensions cancel each other out. The thread
always buckles at a spot where the cross section is small due to the unevenness
of the thread. During the spinning process this spot took up more twists and is
therefore subjected to higher inner tensions, which ultimately break the thread
core. Although thicker yarns are less twisted than fine ones, the inner tension
rises opposite to the yarn size. Smaller yarn is more weakened by steaming.
Further positive aspects of steaming are the reduction of curling and, at the
same time, the setting of the physical properties of closeness and extension
imparted to the yarn by twisting.
***** The chemical process[edit] *****
There are completely different behaviors depending on the kind of yarn
material. Much is known about the steaming of woolen yarns but more research is
needed on the steaming behaviour of artificial fibers and cotton.
**** Wool[edit] ****
As soon as steam enters, the yarns quantity of moisture rises at once, caused
by the heating of the yarn and by steam condensation. According to Speakmann
the following phenomena can be seen in the stretched woolen fiber: The cystine
side chains are subjected to a hydrolysis at the sulphur bridge, where cystine
is dissolved into cysteine and a not yet isolated sulphonic acid.
Physical and chemical forces between two polypeptide chains
1. Hydrogen bridges between peptide groups (polar bond)
2. Cystine bridge (covalent bond)
3. Salt bridge between two amino acids (ionic bond)
4. Hydrophobic bond between a valine and an isolyeine rest (non-polar bond)
The broken ellipse shows the part where water is displaced.
An ionization can be seen at the bridges that were produced from salt
liberation. Due to the increase of temperature in the fibers during steaming an
oscillation of the molecules is produced which leads to the bursting of the
hydrogen bridges; now residual valencies are set free which are able to
saturate with the dipole water. The water then acts like a lubrication between
the individual molecules. Thus the bonds of the main chains between each other
are dissolved by the side chains, the individual polypeptide chains can shift
against each other and the tensions find their equilibrium (see illustration
4). When the steaming of the yarn is continued, new side chains are formed
between the individual components of the main chains. When finally the yarn is
dried, i.e. the moisture balance occurring within the yarn, salt is liberated
again and hydrogen bridges are formed. Now the individual polypeptide chains
can no longer be shifted against each other and the fibers regained their
former closeness, however without having remarkable tensions inside.
The yarn or doubled yarn twist is set. Of course, the morphological structure
of the fibers must be considered when equalizing the tensions by steaming.
Since the woolen fiber very quickly gets the temperature for breaking up the
hydrogen bridges and the steam for hydrolysing the cystine bridges, a
relatively quick twist modification is possible which roughly corresponds to
the values of an autoclave moderated yarn; however, the steaming quality of the
Steamatic steaming process is much better with reference to the evenness of
moisture absorption.
**** Synthetic fiber[edit] ****
Fiber strength and elongation
1. amorphous fiber domains
2. crystalline fiber domains
3. bonding force
Synthetic fibers can be divided up into two fiber domains, the crystalline
(organized) domain and the amorphous (unorganized) domain. In crystalline
domains physical forces of attraction are acting between the closely parallel
lines of polymers. These forces acting transversely to the fiber axis make up
the closeness of a fiber. If tension is applied to the fiber, these forces
hinder the fiber from breaking.
In contrast, the amorphous fiber domains act like links of the fibers. They are
responsible for the flexional strength of the fibers. Additionally, the
amorphous fiber domains make it possible for water or dye to enter.
[Properties_of_amorphous_and_crystalline_fiber_domains]
During steaming, the heating of the fiber causes its molecules to start
oscillating. The increase of oscillation that can be influenced by the degree
and the period of heating dissolves the electric bond forces in the fiber; at
first in the amorphous domains, later in the crystalline ones and at last in
the polymers. As with wool, the tensions brought in by spinning are set free.
During drying or cooling of the fiber, the binding forces are rebuilt without
having tensions in the inner part.
The problem of synthetic_fibers is that the reduction of the binding forces
only takes place between the so-called deformation point (start of changing the
firm solidified â amorphous fiber domains into a visco-elastic â easily
deformable state) and the distortion point (the crystalline fiber domains
change into a visco-elastic state, too) which is in a relatively high
temperature range.
*** Glass transition temperature â and deformation point of artificial fiber
[edit] ***
Material  Deformation point Distortion temperature
Polyester 80-85 Â°C       230-240 Â°C
Nylon 6   80-85 Â°C       180-200 Â°C
Nylon 66  90-95 Â°C       220-235 Â°C
This is also an explanation for the fact that wool mixed with synthetic fibers
is more difficult to set than pure wool. Setting synthetic fibers is only
possible beyond a temperature range of 85 to 95 Â°C. In contrast, pure wool can
set very well at these temperatures.
**** Cotton[edit] ****
In in-line steaming, cotton plays a more or less subordinate role. The exact
physical or chemical process in the fiber are not well known.
***** Applications in the carpet industry[edit] *****
The quality of cut pile carpets is improved significantly by a reduction of
inner tensions in the yarn. This essential benefit results from the effects of
steaming and heatsetting.
**** Carpet classification[edit] ****
Carpet styles are divided into two basic types. These types are loop pile
carpets and cut pile carpets. Especially for cut-pile and its variations
(Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance.
**** Tip definition (pinpoint tip definition)[edit] ****
"Pinpoint tip definition" after Heatsetting
Usually, when yarn is cut, the ends fray similar to the way the ends of a braid
or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying
must be avoided in cut-pile carpets by all means. A cut pile carpet with frayed
yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and ergonomic
disadvantages for the "walker" as scientific research has proven. The carpet is
less elastic and doesn't absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set
carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive,
durable and comfortable for the user. The added value of heatset carpet is
significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy
structure, which is called "pinpoint tip definition" in the industry. The
appearance of the cut pile ends is similar to pin points.
***** Current heat setting processes[edit] *****
Several different heat setting processes are known in the textile industry. The
most important are presented here.
**** Autoclave heat setting[edit] ****
Autoclave Heatsetting
The oldest heat setting process is autoclave heat setting. Mostly, it is a
discontinuous process.Autoclave installations use vacuum and/or pressure.
Textile material is brought into the autoclave either on bobbins, in skeins or
loose in a container. As nearly all autoclaves are exposed to certain pressures
they are usually built in cylindrical shape and mounted horizontally. Most
commonly, autoclaves are loaded and unloaded from the end of the cylinder but
some may be loaded from one end and unloaded from the other end. Autoclaves
mounted vertically exist but are less common. They are mostly used for the
synthetic yarns like polyester, polyethylene, poly propylene and nylons.
**** Steamatic process[edit] ****
For automation in link spinning/winding there is the so-called "in-line
steamer". The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by
Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring
spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has
finished spinning, the loaded bobbins are transported into the in-line steamer.
Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within
seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the
winding machine where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package.
The carpet industry currently utilizes two continuous processes, the Power-
Heat-Set process and the TVP process which was derived from the autoclave
technology.
**** Power-Heat-Set technology[edit] ****
The Power-Heat-Set process, formerly known as Suessen process, was developed in
the beginning of the 1970s and was the first continuous heat setting system
worldwide. The process itself was revolutionary in that it was the first system
not operated with saturated steam and pressure, but with a superheated steam/
airmix at atmospheric pressure. Using this innovative technology, completely
new carpet collections were created. In the Power-Heat-Set process, the yarns
and filaments oxidize slightly on the surface due to the existing oxygen in the
surrounding atmosphere and the higher temperatures. This capillary oxide film
causes the complete carpet later to be more stain resistant. Dirt particles
adhere less to the fibers.
**** SUPERBA TVP process[edit] ****
In addition to the Power-Heat-Set technology there is the SUPERBA TVP3 process
which is also a continuous process. In the TVP3 process yarn is placed on a
conveyor belt and inserted through a lock into a pressure tunnel that could be
up to 15 m long. Inside the tunnel, it undergoes a heat setting process with
saturated steam. At the end of the tunnel the yarn is taken out through a
second lock. The yarn which is still hot and moist is dried and cooled after
heat setting and fed to the winding process. Up to 72 yarn ends can be
processed at the same time.
***** Process description (exemplary with the Power-Heat-Set process)[edit]
*****
Frieze and straight Yarn after Power-Heat-Setting
In the Power-Heat-Set process yarn is heat set with superheated steam in an
open system at atmospheric pressure. All the materials normally used in the
carpet industry such as polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6, polypropylene, Acrylic,
PET, polyester and wool can be processed.
The unprocessed yarn is provided on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At
a speed of up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered
into the heat setting process. There are two basic ways of transportation of
the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a
"figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in
order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying
is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special stuffer box, the so-called
Twinroll-Box (TRB). The heat setting process takes place at temperatures
between 110 Â°C and 200 Â°C in a steam-air-mix. After heat setting, the yarn is
cooled and wound onto packages again at the winder. In general a heat setting
machine consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production
of up to 10.5 tons is possible.
