An altimeter or an altitude meter is an instrument used to measure the altitude
of an object above a fixed level. The measurement of altitude is called
altimetry, which is related to the term bathymetry, the measurement of depth
under water.

***** Pressure altimeter[edit] *****
Digital barometric pressure sensor for altitude measurement in consumer
electronic applications
Altitude can be determined based on the measurement of atmospheric_pressure.
The greater the altitude, the lower the pressure. When a barometer is supplied
with a nonlinear calibration so as to indicate altitude, the instrument is
called a pressure altimeter or barometric altimeter. A pressure altimeter is
the altimeter found in most aircraft, and skydivers use wrist-mounted versions
for similar purposes. Hikers and mountain climbers use wrist-mounted or hand-
held altimeters, in addition to other navigational tools such as a map,
magnetic compass, or GPS receiver.
The calibration of an altimeter follows the equation
         z = c  T  log &#x2061; (  P  o    /  P ) ,   {\displaystyle
      z=c\;T\;\log(P_{o}/P),}  [z=c\;T\;\log(P_{o}/P),][1]
where c is a constant, T is the absolute temperature, P is the pressure at
altitude z, and Po is the pressure at sea level. The constant c depends on the
acceleration of gravity and the molar mass of the air. However, one must be
aware that this type of altimeter relies on "density altitude" and its readings
can vary by hundreds of feet owing to a sudden change in air pressure, such as
from a cold front, without any actual change in altitude.[2]
**** Use in hiking, climbing and skiing[edit] ****
A barometric altimeter, used along with a topographic map, can help to verify
one's location. It is more reliable, and often more accurate, than a GPS
receiver for measuring altitude; the GPS signal may be unavailable, for
example, when one is deep in a canyon, or it may give wildly inaccurate
altitudes when all available satellites are near the horizon. Because
barometric pressure changes with the weather, hikers must periodically re-
calibrate their altimeters when they reach a known altitude, such as a trail
junction or peak marked on a topographical map.
**** Skydiving[edit] ****

An altimeter is the most important piece of skydiving equipment, after the
parachute itself. Altitude awareness is crucial at all times during the jump,
and determines the appropriate response to maintain safety.
Since altitude awareness is so important in skydiving, there is a wide variety
of altimeter designs made specifically for use in the sport, and a non-student
skydiver will typically use two or more altimeters in a single jump:[3]
    * Hand, wrist or chest-mounted mechanical analogue visual altimeters. This
      is the most basic and common type, and is used by (and commonly mandated
      for) virtually all student skydivers. The common design has a face marked
      from 0 to 4000 m (or 0 to 12000 ft, mimicking the clock_face), on which
      an arrow points to the current altitude. The face plate sports sections
      prominently marked with yellow and red respectively, signifying the
      recommended deployment altitude, as well as emergency procedure decision
      altitude (commonly known as "hard deck"). A mechanical altimeter has a
      knob that needs to be manually adjusted to make it point to 0 on the
      ground before jump, and if the landing spot is not at the same altitude
      as the takeoff spot, the user needs to adjust it appropriately. Some
      advanced electronic altimeters are also available which make use of the
      familiar analogue display, despite internally operating digitally.
    * Digital visual altimeters, mounted on the wrist or hand. This type always
      operates electronically, and conveys the altitude as a number, rather
      than a pointer on a dial. Since these altimeters already contain all the
      electronic circuitry necessary for altitude calculation, they are
      commonly equipped with auxiliary functions such as electronic logbook,
      real-time jump profile replay, speed indication, simulator mode for use
      in ground training, etc. An electronic altimeter is activated on the
      ground before the jump, and calibrates automatically to point to 0. It is
      thus essential that the user not turn it on earlier than necessary to
      avoid, for example, the drive to a dropzone located at a different
      altitude than one's home which could cause a potentially fatal false
      reading. If the intended landing zone is at a different elevation than
      the takeoff point, the user needs to input the appropriate offset by
      using a designated function.
    * Audible altimeters (also known as "dytters", a genericised_trademark of
      the first such product on the market). These are inserted into one's
      helmet, and emit a warning tone at a predefined altitude. Contemporary
      audibles have evolved significantly from their crude beginnings, and
      sport a vast array of functions, such as multiple tones at different
      altitudes, multiple saved profiles that can be switched quickly,
      electronic logbook with data transfer to a PC for later analysis,
      distinct free fall and canopy modes with different warning altitudes,
      swoop approach guiding tones, etc. Audibles are strictly auxiliary
      devices, and do not replace, but complement a visual altimeter which
      remains the primary tool for maintaining altitude awareness. The advent
      of modern skydiving disciplines such as freeflying, in which the ground
      might not be in one's field of view for long periods of time, has made
      the use of audibles nearly universal, and virtually all skydiving helmets
      come with one or more built-in ports in which an audible might be placed.
      Audibles are not recommended and often banned from use by student
      skydivers, who need to build up a proper altitude awareness regime for
      themselves.
    * Auxiliary visual altimeters. These do not show the precise altitude, but
      rather help maintain a general indicator in one's peripheral vision. They
      might either operate in tandem with an audible equipped with an
      appropriate port, in which case they emit warning flashes complementing
      the audible tones, or be standalone and use another display mode, such as
      showing either green or red light depending on the altitude.
Speaking Altimeter with helmet for skydiving
    * Speaking altimeters (also known as voice altimeters). Another type of
      altimeter that combines both audible and visual altimeter functions. Unit
      has all necessary altitudes used in Skydiving and announces it as a
      number in Skydiver's native language. These are also inserted into helmet
      (the same pocket size as for audibles), but emit voice with automatic
      volume adjustment depend on the speed to clear hearing. Speaking
      altimeters usually has software configuration via mobile application.
      Main goal of this type of altimeter is strong security feature for
      experienced skydivers, so they always know own current position that very
      useful for FS load organizers or AFF instructors as well.
The exact choice of altimeters depends heavily on the individual skydiver's
preferences, experience level, primary disciplines, as well as the type of the
jump.[4] On one end of the spectrum, a low-altitude demonstration jump with
water landing and no free fall might waive the mandated use of altimeters and
use none at all. In contrast, a jumper doing freeflying jumps and flying a high
performance canopy might use a mechanical analogue altimeter for easy reference
in free fall, an in-helmet audible for breakaway altitude warning, additionally
programmed with swoop guide tones for canopy flying, as well as a digital
altimeter on an armband for quickly glancing the precise altitude on approach.
Another skydiver doing similar types of jumps might wear a digital altimeter
for their primary visual one, preferring the direct altitude readout of a
numeric display.
**** Use in aircraft[edit] ****
Schematic of a drum-type aircraft altimeter, showing the small Kollsman windows
at the bottom left and bottom right of the face.
In aircraft, an aneroid_barometer measures the atmospheric_pressure from a
static_port outside the aircraft. Air pressure decreases with an increase of
altitudeâapproximately 100 hectopascals per 800 meters or one inch_of_mercury
per 1000 feet near sea_level.
An old Aircraft Altimeter
The aneroid altimeter is calibrated to show the pressure directly as an
altitude above mean_sea_level, in accordance with a mathematical model
atmosphere defined by the International_Standard_Atmosphere (ISA). Older
aircraft used a simple aneroid_barometer where the needle made less than one
revolution around the face from zero to full scale. This design evolved to
altimeters with a primary needle and one or more secondary needles that show
the number of revolutions, similar to a clock_face. In other words, each needle
points to a different digit of the current altitude measurement. However this
design has fallen out of favor due to the risk of misreading in stressful
situations. The design evolved further to drum-type altimeters, the final step
in analogue instrumentation, where each revolution of a single needle accounted
for 1,000 feet (300 metres), with thousand foot increments recorded on a
numerical odometer-type drum. To determine altitude, a pilot had first to read
the drum to determine the thousands of feet, then look at the needle for the
hundreds of feet. Modern analogue altimeters in transport aircraft are
typically drum-type. The latest development in clarity is an Electronic_flight
instrument_system with integrated digital altimeter displays. This technology
has trickled down from airliners and military planes until it is now standard
in many general_aviation aircraft.
Modern aircraft use a "sensitive altimeter". On a sensitive altimeter, the sea-
level reference pressure can be adjusted with a setting knob. The reference
pressure, in inches_of_mercury in Canada and the United_States, and
hectopascals (previously_millibars) elsewhere, is displayed in the small
Kollsman window,[5] on the face of the aircraft altimeter. This is necessary,
since sea level reference atmospheric pressure at a given location varies over
time with temperature and the movement of pressure_systems in the atmosphere.
Diagram showing the internal components of the sensitive aircraft altimeter.
In aviation terminology, the regional or local air pressure at mean sea level
(MSL) is called the QNH or "altimeter_setting", and the pressure that will
calibrate the altimeter to show the height above ground at a given airfield is
called the QFE of the field. An altimeter cannot, however, be adjusted for
variations in air temperature. Differences in temperature from the ISA model
will accordingly cause errors in indicated altitude.
In aerospace, the mechanical stand-alone altimeters which are based on
diaphragm bellows were replaced by integrated measurement systems which are
called air_data_computers (ADC). This module measures altitude, speed of flight
and outside temperature to provide more precise output data allowing automatic
flight control and flight_level division. Multiple altimeters can be used to
design a pressure_reference_system to provide information about the airplane's
position angles to further support inertial_navigation_system calculations.
***** Use in ground effect vehicle[edit] *****
After extensive research and experimentation, it has been shown that "phase
radio-altimeters" are most suitable for ground_effect_vehicles, as compared to
laser, isotropic or ultrasonic altimeters.[6]
***** Sonic altimeter[edit] *****
In 1931, the US Army Air Corps and General Electric tested a sonic altimeter
for aircraft, which was considered more reliable and accurate than one that
relied on air pressure when heavy fog or rain was present. The new altimeter
used a series of high-pitched sounds like those made by a bat to measure the
distance from the aircraft to the surface, which on return to the aircraft was
converted to feet shown on a gauge inside the aircraft cockpit.[7]
***** Radar altimeter[edit] *****
Main article: Radar_altimeter
A radar_altimeter measures altitude more directly, using the time taken for a
radio signal to reflect from the surface back to the aircraft. Alternatively,
Frequency Modulated Continuous-wave radar can be used. The greater the
frequency shift the further the distance traveled. This method can achieve much
better accuracy than the pulsed radar for the same outlay and radar altimeters
that use frequency modulation are industry standard. The radar altimeter is
used to measure height above ground level during landing in commercial and
military aircraft. Radar altimeters are also a component of terrain avoidance
warning systems, warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low, or if
there is rising terrain ahead. Radar altimeter technology is also used in
terrain-following_radar allowing fighter_aircraft to fly at very low altitude.
The altimeter on this Piper_PA-28 is seen on the top row of instruments, second
from right
***** Global Positioning System[edit] *****
Global_Positioning_System (GPS) receivers can also determine altitude by
trilateration with four or more satellites. In aircraft, altitude determined
using autonomous GPS is not reliable enough to supersede the pressure altimeter
without using some method of augmentation.[8] In hiking and climbing, it is
common to find that the altitude measured by GPS is off by as much as 400 feet
(120 metres) depending on satellite orientation.[9]
***** Other modes of transport[edit] *****
The altimeter is an instrument optional in off-road vehicles to aid in
navigation. Some high-performance luxury cars that were never intended to leave
paved roads, such as the Duesenberg in the 1930s, have also been equipped with
altimeters.
Hikers and mountaineers use hand-held or wrist-mounted barometric altimeters,
as do skydivers.
Diesel submarines have barometers installed on them to monitor vacuum being
pulled in the event that the snorkel closes while the diesels are running and,
as a consequence, sucking the air out of the boat.
