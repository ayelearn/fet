In dynamical_system_theory, a phase space is a space in which all possible
states of a system are represented, with each possible state corresponding to
one unique point in the phase space. For mechanical_systems, the phase space
usually consists of all possible values of position and momentum variables. The
concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by Ludwig
Boltzmann, Henri_PoincarÃ©, and Willard_Gibbs.[1]

***** Introduction[edit] *****
In a phase space, every degree_of_freedom or parameter of the system is
represented as an axis of a multidimensional space; a one-dimensional system is
called a phase_line, while a two-dimensional system is called a phase_plane.
For every possible state of the system, or allowed combination of values of the
system's parameters, a point is included in the multidimensional space. The
system's evolving state over time traces a path (a phase space trajectory for
the system) through the high-dimensional space. The phase space trajectory
represents the set of states compatible with starting from one particular
initial_condition, located in the full phase space that represents the set of
states compatible with starting from any initial condition. As a whole, the
phase diagram represents all that the system can be, and its shape can easily
elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise. A phase
space may contain a great number of dimensions. For instance, a gas containing
many molecules may require a separate dimension for each particle's x, y and z
positions and momenta (6 dimensions for an idealized monatomic gas), and for
more complex molecular systems additional dimensions are required to describe
vibrational modes of the molecular bonds, as well as spin around 3 axes. Phase
spaces are easier to use when analyzing behavior of mechanical systems
restricted to motion around and along various axes of rotation or translation -
e.g. in robotics, like analyzing the range of motion of a robotic_arm or
determining the optimal path to achieve a particular position/momentum result.
**** Conjugate momenta[edit] ****
Evolution of an ensemble of classical systems in phase space (top). The systems
are a massive particle in a one-dimensional potential well (red curve, lower
figure). The initially compact ensemble becomes swirled up over time.
In classical mechanics, any choice of generalized_coordinates qi for the
position (i.e. coordinates on configuration_space) defines conjugate
generalized_momenta pi which together define co-ordinates on phase space. More
abstractly, in classical mechanics phase space is the cotangent_bundle of
configuration space, and in this interpretation the procedure above expresses
that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a choice of
natural local Darboux_coordinates for the standard symplectic_structure on a
cotangent space.
**** Statistical ensembles in phase space[edit] ****
The motion of an ensemble of systems in this space is studied by classical
statistical_mechanics. The local density of points in such systems obeys
Liouville's_theorem, and so can be taken as constant. Within the context of a
model system in classical mechanics, the phase space coordinates of the system
at any given time are composed of all of the system's dynamic variables.
Because of this, it is possible to calculate the state of the system at any
given time in the future or the past, through integration of Hamilton's or
Lagrange's equations of motion.
***** Examples[edit] *****

simple pendulum.

speed.
**** Low dimensions[edit] ****
Main articles: phase_line_(mathematics) and phase_plane
For simple systems, there may be as few as one or two degrees of freedom. One
degree of freedom occurs when one has an autonomous ordinary_differential
equation in a single variable,     d y  /  d t = f ( y ) ,   {\displaystyle dy/
dt=f(y),}  [dy/dt=f(y),] with the resulting one-dimensional system being called
a phase_line, and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately
visible from the phase line. The simplest non-trivial examples are the
exponential_growth_model/decay (one unstable/stable equilibrium) and the
logistic_growth_model (two equilibria, one stable, one unstable).
The phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a phase_plane, which
occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension,
and where the two variables are position and velocity. In this case, a sketch
of the phase_portrait may give qualitative information about the dynamics of
the system, such as the limit_cycle of the Van_der_Pol_oscillator shown in the
diagram.
Here, the horizontal axis gives the position and vertical axis the velocity. As
the system evolves, its state follows one of the lines (trajectories) on the
phase diagram.

**** Chaos theory[edit] ****
Classic examples of phase diagrams from chaos_theory are :
    * the Lorenz_attractor
    * population growth (i.e. logistic_map)
    * parameter plane of complex_quadratic_polynomials with Mandelbrot_set.
***** Phase plot[edit] *****
A plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes
called a phase plot or a phase diagram. Phase_diagram, however, is more usually
reserved in the physical_sciences for a diagram showing the various regions of
stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system, which consists of
pressure, temperature, and composition.
***** Quantum mechanics[edit] *****
In quantum_mechanics, the coordinates p and q of phase space normally become
Hermitian_operators in a Hilbert_space.
But they may alternatively retain their classical interpretation, provided
functions of them compose in novel algebraic ways (through Groenewold's_1946
star_product. This is consistent with the uncertainty_principle of quantum
mechanics. Every quantum mechanical observable corresponds to a unique function
or distribution on phase space, and vice versa, as specified by Hermann_Weyl
(1927) and supplemented by John_von_Neumann (1931); Eugene_Wigner (1932); and,
in a grand synthesis, by H_J_Groenewold (1946). With J_E_Moyal (1949), these
completed the foundations of the phase_space_formulation of quantum mechanics,
a complete and logically autonomous reformulation of quantum mechanics.[2] (Its
modern abstractions include deformation_quantization and geometric
quantization.)
Expectation values in phase-space quantization are obtained isomorphically to
tracing operator observables with the density matrix in Hilbert space: they are
obtained by phase-space integrals of observables, with the Wigner_quasi-
probability_distribution effectively serving as a measure.
Thus, by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space (the same ambit as for
classical mechanics), the Weyl_map facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics
as a deformation (generalization) of classical mechanics, with deformation
parameter Ä§/S, where S is the action of the relevant process. (Other familiar
deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical Newtonian into
relativistic_mechanics, with deformation parameter v/c;[citation_needed] or the
deformation of Newtonian gravity into General_Relativity, with deformation
parameter Schwarzschild_radius/characteristic-dimension.)[citation_needed]
Classical expressions, observables, and operations (such as Poisson brackets)
are modified by Ä§-dependent quantum corrections, as the conventional
commutative multiplication applying in classical mechanics is generalized to
the noncommutative star-multiplication characterizing quantum mechanics and
underlying its uncertainty principle.
***** Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics[edit] *****
In thermodynamics and statistical_mechanics contexts, the term phase space has
two meanings: It is used in the same sense as in classical mechanics. If a
thermodynamic system consists of N particles, then a point in the 6N-
dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that
system, as each particle is associated with three position variables and three
momentum variables. In this sense, as long as the particles are
distinguishable, a point in phase space is said to be a microstate of the
system. (For indistinguishable_particles a microstate will consist of a set of
N! points, corresponding to all possible exchanges of the N particles.) N is
typically on the order of Avogadro's_number, thus describing the system at a
microscopic level is often impractical. This leads to the use of phase space in
a different sense.
The phase space can also refer to the space that is parametrized by the
macroscopic states of the system, such as pressure, temperature, etc. For
instance, one may view the pressure-volume diagram or entropy-temperature
diagrams as describing part of this phase space. A point in this phase space is
correspondingly called a macrostate. There may easily be more than one
microstate with the same macrostate. For example, for a fixed temperature, the
system could have many dynamic configurations at the microscopic level. When
used in this sense, a phase is a region of phase space where the system in
question is in, for example, the liquid phase, or solid phase, etc.
Since there are many more microstates than macrostates, the phase space in the
first sense is usually a manifold of much larger dimensions than in the second
sense. Clearly, many more parameters are required to register every detail of
the system down to the molecular or atomic scale than to simply specify, say,
the temperature or the pressure of the system.
***** Optics[edit] *****
Phase space is extensively used in nonimaging_optics,[3] the branch of optics
devoted to illumination. It is also an important concept in Hamiltonian_optics.
***** Phase integral[edit] *****
In classical statistical mechanics (continuous energies) the concept of phase
space provides a classical analog to the partition_function (sum over states)
known as the phase integral.[4] Instead of summing the Boltzmann factor over
discretely spaced energy states (defined by appropriate integer quantum_numbers
for each degree of freedom) one may integrate over continuous phase space. Such
integration essentially consists of two parts: integration of the momentum
component of all degrees of freedom (momentum space) and integration of the
position component of all degrees of freedom (configuration space). Once the
phase integral is known, it may be related to the classical partition function
by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of
quantum_energy_states per unit phase space. This normalization constant is
simply the inverse of Planck's_constant raised to a power equal to the number
of degrees of freedom for the system.[5]
