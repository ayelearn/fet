Tomato sauce (also known as Neapolitan sauce, salsa roja in Spanish, or salsa
di pomodoro in Italian) can refer to a large number of different sauces made
primarily from tomatoes, usually to be served as part of a dish, rather than as
a condiment. Tomato sauces are common for meat and vegetables, but they are
perhaps best known as bases for Mexican salsas or sauces for pasta_dishes.
Tomatoes have a rich flavor, high water content, soft flesh which breaks down
easily, and the right composition to thicken into a sauce when they are cooked
(without the need of thickeners such as roux). All of these qualities make them
ideal for simple and appealing sauces.
In countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South
Africa, the term tomato sauce is used to describe a condiment similar to
ketchup.[2] In some of these countries, both terms are used for the condiment.

***** History[edit] *****
The first person to write about what may have been a tomato sauce was
Bernardino_de_SahagÃºn, a Franciscan friar from the Kingdom_of_Spain who later
moved to New_Spain, made note of a prepared sauce that was offered for sale in
the markets of Tenochtitlan (Mexico_City today).[3] The use of tomato sauce
with pasta appeared for the first time in 1790 in the Italian cookbook L'Apicio
moderno, by Roman chef Francesco_Leonardi.[4]
***** Description[edit] *****
A tomato-based sauce containing tomato puree, diced tomatoes, and bell_peppers
(red, yellow, and green), with the seeds included. It is seasoned with fresh
garlic, basil, oregano, paprika, cajun_seasoning, crushed_red_pepper, parsley,
olive_oil, and possibly some additional seasonings.
The simplest tomato sauce consists just of chopped tomatoes cooked down
(possibly with olive_oil) and simmered until it loses its raw flavor. Of
course, it may be seasoned with salt, or other herbs or spices. Optionally,
tomato skins may be scalded and peeled according to texture (especially thicker
pelati paste varieties) and tomato seeds may be removed for aesthetic purposes,
leaving just the tomato flesh and pulp.
Just like tomato_puree or tomato_paste, tomato sauce may be one of the
ingredients in other dishes, like a tomato-based_soup. The sauce is thinner
than either the puree, or the paste (which is the thickest), and it may have
additional flavors.
Water (or another, more flavorful, liquid, such as stock or wine) is sometimes
added to keep it from drying out too much. Onion and garlic are almost always
sweated or sautÃ©ed at the beginning before the tomato is added, or purÃ©ed
together with tomatoes and then cooked together. Other seasonings typically
include dried mild chili_peppers (such as guajillo_chili or pasilla_chili),
epazote, basil, oregano, parsley, and black_pepper. Ground or chopped meat is
also common.
***** Varieties[edit] *****
**** Mexican[edit] ****

Main article: Salsa_(sauce)
Tomato sauce was an ancient condiment in Mesoamerican food. The first person to
write about what may have been a tomato sauce was Bernardino_de_SahagÃºn, a
Franciscan friar from the Kingdom_of_Spain who later moved to New_Spain, made
note of a prepared sauce that was offered for sale in the markets of
Tenochtitlan (Mexico_City today). Of this he wrote (translated from Spanish),
     They sell some stews made of peppers and tomatoes â usually put in
     them peppers, pumpkin seeds, tomatoes, green peppers and fat tomatoes
     and other things that make tasty stews.[3]
     â Florentine Codex (1540â1585)
Spaniards later brought the use of tomatoes to Europe.
Basic Mexican tomato sauce (salsa de tomate rojo o jitomate) was traditionally
prepared with a molcajete to puree the tomatoes. Food that is cooked in tomato
sauce is known as entomatada. Tomato sauce is used as a base for spicy sauces
and moles.[5]
**** Italian[edit] ****
Penne pasta served with tomato sauce
The misconception that the tomato has been central to Italian_cuisine since its
introduction from the Americas is often repeated. Though the tomato was
introduced from the Spanish New World to European botanists in the 16th
century, tomato sauce made a relatively late entry in Italian cuisine: in
Antonio_Latini's cookbook Lo scalco alla moderna (Naples, 1692).[6]
Latini was chef to the Spanish viceroy of Naples, and one of his tomato recipes
is for sauce alla spagnuola, "in the Spanish style". The first known use of
tomato sauce with pasta appears in the Italian cookbook L'Apicio moderno, by
Roman chef Francesco_Leonardi, edited in 1790.[4]
Italian varieties of tomato sauce range from the very simple pasta_al_pomodoro
to the piquant puttanesca and arrabbiata sauces. Tomato sauce with pasta can
stand on its own or it can also be paired with ingredients such as Italian
sausage, clams, bacon cubes, tuna, meatballs or vegetables, for a more lively
pasta dish.
Tomato-garlic_sauce is prepared using tomatoes as a main ingredient, and is
used in various cuisines and dishes. In Italian cuisine, alla pizzaiola refers
to tomato-garlic sauce, which is used on pizza, pasta and meats.[7]
**** French[edit] ****
Sauce tomate is one of the five mother_sauces of classical_French_cooking, as
codified by Auguste_Escoffier in the early 20th century. It consists of salt
belly_of_pork, onions, bay leaves, thyme, tomato purÃ©e or fresh tomatoes,
roux, garlic, salt, sugar, and pepper. Many times, butter and flour will be
listed in the ingredients, but those are only used to make the roux (thickening
agent).
**** New Zealand and South Africa[edit] ****
The most common use of the term tomato sauce in New Zealand and South Africa is
to describe a popular, commercially produced condiment that is a type of table
sauce, similar to American ketchup but without vinegar, which is typically
applied to foods such as meat_pies, sausages, other cooked meat (in particular
steak), and fish_and_chips.[8] Tomato-based sauces served with pasta would
commonly be referred to as "pasta sauce" or "Napoletana sauce".[disputed  –
discuss]
**** United Kingdom[edit] ****
The meaning of the term "tomato sauce" depends on the context; on a restaurant
menu the phrase "in a tomato sauce" means a freshly prepared tomato based sauce
as used on pasta, and colloquially it may refer to either the pasta sauce, or
American ketchup.[disputed  – discuss]
**** Australia[edit] ****
In Australia "tomato sauce" generally refers to the same style of Table_Sauce
as American ketchup but varies in mixture and doesn't contain onions[9]. Some
sources claim that Australian tomato sauce has less tomato than ketchup[10],
but this varies between brands and is not a universal feature. Australian
tomato sauce is used in the same way as American ketchup. "Tomato sauce" may
also be used in its generic English meaning of a sauce primarily based on
tomatoes, as in a menu item "Gnocchi in a tomato sauce" where it would be
understood that the sauce would be of the kind used in Italian cooking for
pastas.
**** United States[edit] ****
Ingredients to make a U.S.-style salsa
Ingredients added to the sauce without browning
In the U.S., "tomato sauce" refers to two distinct sauces. One is a tomato
concentrate with salt and minimal herbs, used in cooking. This product is
considered incomplete and not normally used as is. Related ingredients are
tomato_purÃ©e and tomato_paste, each of which is similar but paste has a
thicker consistency. Tomato purÃ©e and tomato paste have FDA standards of
identity (since 1939) for percentage of tomato solids, and generally do not
contain seasonings other than salt; tomato sauce is nonstandardized.[11]
The second use of the term "tomato sauce" in the U.S. is for a cooked sauce of
tomatoes, usually containing olive oil and garlic. This type of tomato sauce is
generally served with pasta, and sometimes with meat. Less commonly, it is
served with chicken or beef alone. One popular variety of tomato sauce is
marinara_sauce,an Italian-American term for a simple tomato sauce with herbs
â mostly parsley and basil.
Contrary to what the name might suggest ('marinara' is Italian for "sailor-
style") it is without seafood. In Italy, marinara refers either to sauces made
with tomato and garlic (as in pizza marinara) or to seafood-based sauces or
foods; in this case, the name does not imply that tomato is either included or
excluded.
Some Italian_Americans on the East_Coast and around the Chicago_area refer to
tomato sauce as "gravy", "tomato gravy", or "Sunday gravy", especially sauces
with a large quantity of meat simmered in them, similar to the Italian
Neapolitan_ragÃ¹. The term "Sunday gravy" derives from the Italian tradition of
having a large, family dinner on Sunday afternoons. "Gravy" is an erroneous
English translation from the Italian sugo which means juice, but can also mean
sauce (as in sugo per pastasciutta).[12]
The expression for "gravy" in Italian is sugo d'arrosto, which is literally
"juice of a roast" and is not specifically tomato sauce.[12] Sicilian_Americans
in communities like Buffalo and Rochester, New_York use the terms "sarsa" and
"succu" interchangeably for tomato sauces of all types used with pasta, and
"gravy" only in reference to brown meat gravies. The Italian-American community
of New_Orleans, however, is largely Sicilian in origin and takes great pride in
its Creole-Italian cuisine largely based on what is known locally as "red
gravy" (tomato sauce).
American supermarkets commonly carry a variety of prepared tomato sauces
described as "spaghetti sauce" or "pasta sauce." Common variations include meat
sauce, marinara sauce, and sauces with mushrooms or sweet red peppers.

*** Louisiana[edit] ***
A spicy tomato sauce known as sauce piquante is common in Louisiana Cajun
cuisine, that can contain any seafood, poultry, or meats such as wild game. It
is typically served over white rice. In Louisiana_Creole_cuisine, there is a
tomato sauce known as a Creole sauce. It is similar to Italian tomato sauce,
but features more Louisiana flavors derived from the fusion of French and
Spanish cooking styles. They both usually contain the traditional holy_trinity
of diced bell_pepper, onion, and celery.
*** Tomato gravy[edit] ***
Tomato gravy is distinct from the term as used by Italian Americans when
referring to a type of tomato sauce particularly where tomatoes were a staple
food. The cooked tomatoes, some fat (usually cured pork_fat) and flour are
cooked together until thick, and seasoned with salt and pepper. Onions or bell
peppers may be added as well. Typically, tomato gravy is served over pasta. It
is also eaten largely by Creole people in the Southern United States, who eat
it over rice.
**** Indian[edit] ****
Some Indian curries have a tomato based sauce, many vegetarian style dishes.
