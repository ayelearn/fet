Dimensionless quantity that is used to help predict fluid flow patterns
The plume from this candle flame goes from laminar to turbulent. The Reynolds
number can be used to predict where this transition will take place.
A vortex_street around a cylinder. This can occur around cylinders and spheres,
for any fluid, cylinder size and fluid speed, provided that it has a Reynolds
number between roughly 40 and 1000.[1]
George_Stokes introduced Reynolds numbers.
Osborne_Reynolds popularised the concept.
The Reynolds number (Re) is an important dimensionless_quantity in fluid
mechanics used to help predict flow patterns in different fluid flow
situations. At low Reynolds numbers, flows tend to be dominated by laminar
(sheet-like) flow, while at high Reynolds numbers turbulence results from
differences in the fluid's speed and direction, which may sometimes intersect
or even move counter to the overall direction of the flow (eddy_currents).
These eddy currents begin to churn the flow, using up energy in the process,
which for liquids increases the chances of cavitation. The Reynolds number has
wide applications, ranging from liquid flow in a pipe to the passage of air
over an aircraft wing. It is used to predict the transition from laminar_to
turbulent flow, and is used in the scaling of similar but different-sized flow
situations, such as between an aircraft model in a wind tunnel and the full
size version. The predictions of the onset of turbulence and the ability to
calculate scaling effects can be used to help predict fluid behaviour on a
larger scale, such as in local or global air or water movement and thereby the
associated meteorological and climatological effects.
The concept was introduced by George_Stokes in 1851,[2] but the Reynolds number
was named by Arnold_Sommerfeld in 1908[3] after Osborne_Reynolds (1842â1912),
who popularized its use in 1883.[4][5]

***** Definition[edit] *****
The Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a
fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid
velocities, which is known as a boundary_layer in the case of a bounding
surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the
introduction of a stream of high-velocity fluid into a low-velocity fluid, such
as the hot gases emitted from a flame in air. This relative movement generates
fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting
this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which tends to inhibit turbulence.
The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of
forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will
occur in a particular situation.[6]
This ability to predict the onset of turbulent flow is an important design tool
for equipment such as piping systems or aircraft wings, but the Reynolds number
is also used in scaling of fluid dynamics problems, and is used to determine
dynamic_similitude between two different cases of fluid flow, such as between a
model aircraft, and its full-size version. Such scaling is not linear and the
application of Reynolds numbers to both situations allows scaling factors to be
developed.
With respect to laminar and turbulent_flow regimes:
    * laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces are
      dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion;
    * turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers and is dominated by
      inertial forces, which tend to produce chaotic eddies, vortices and other
      flow instabilities.[7]
The Reynolds number is defined as[3]
          R e  =    &#x03C1; u L  &#x03BC;   =    u L  &#x03BD;
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho uL}{\mu }}={\frac {uL}{\nu }}}
      [{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho uL}{\mu }}={\frac {uL}{\nu
      }}}]
where:
    * Ï is the density of the fluid (SI_units: kg/m3)
    * u is the velocity of the fluid with respect to the object (m/s)
    * L is a characteristic linear dimension (m)
    * Î¼ is the dynamic_viscosity of the fluid (PaÂ·s or NÂ·s/m2 or kg/mÂ·s)
    * Î½ is the kinematic_viscosity of the fluid (m2/s).
The Reynolds number can be defined for several different situations where a
fluid is in relative motion to a surface.[n_1] These definitions generally
include the fluid properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a
characteristic_length or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation).
This dimension is a matter of convention â for example radius and diameter
are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by
convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in
a pipe, or for a sphere moving in a fluid, the internal diameter is generally
used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects
have an equivalent_diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as
compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian
fluids, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in
some circumstances, notably stirred vessels.
In practice, matching the Reynolds number is not on its own sufficient to
guarantee similitude. Fluid flow is generally chaotic, and very small changes
to shape and surface roughness of bounding surfaces can result in very
different flows. Nevertheless, Reynolds numbers are a very important guide and
are widely used.
***** History[edit] *****
Osborne Reynolds's apparatus of 1883 demonstrating the onset of turbulent flow.
The apparatus is still at the University of Manchester.
Diagram from Reynolds's 1883 paper showing onset of turbulent flow.
Osborne Reynolds famously studied the conditions in which the flow of fluid in
pipes transitioned from laminar_flow to turbulent_flow. In his 1883 paper
Reynolds described the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a classic
experiment in which he examined the behaviour of water flow under different
flow velocities using a small stream of dyed water introduced into the centre
of clear water flow in a larger pipe.
The larger pipe was glass so the behaviour of the layer of the dyed stream
could be observed, and at the end of this pipe there was a flow control valve
used to vary the water velocity inside the tube. When the velocity was low, the
dyed layer remained distinct through the entire length of the large tube. When
the velocity was increased, the layer broke up at a given point and diffused
throughout the fluid's cross-section. The point at which this happened was the
transition point from laminar to turbulent flow.
From these experiments came the dimensionless Reynolds number for dynamic
similarityâthe ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. Reynolds also
proposed what is now known as the Reynolds-averaging of turbulent flows, where
quantities such as velocity are expressed as the sum of mean and fluctuating
components. Such averaging allows for 'bulk' description of turbulent flow, for
example using the Reynolds-averaged_NavierâStokes_equations.
***** Derivation[edit] *****
The form of the Reynolds number can be derived as follows[8]
              R e     =   inertial forces viscous forces   =    m a   &#x03C4;

where:
    *    t   {\displaystyle t}  [t] is time
    *    y   {\displaystyle y}  [y] is cross-sectional position
    *      u =    d x   d t        {\displaystyle {\textstyle u={\frac {dx}

    *    &#x03C1;   {\displaystyle \rho }  [\rho ] is the density of the fluid
      (kg/m3).
***** Flow in a pipe[edit] *****
For flow_in_a_pipe or tube, the Reynolds number is generally defined as[10]
          R e  =    &#x03C1; u  D  H    &#x03BC;   =    u  D  H    &#x03BD;   =
      Q  D  H     &#x03BD; A    ,   {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho
      uD_{\text{H}}}{\mu }}={\frac {uD_{\text{H}}}{\nu }}={\frac {QD_{\text
      {H}}}{\nu A}},}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho uD_{\text
      {H}}}{\mu }}={\frac {uD_{\text{H}}}{\nu }}={\frac {QD_{\text{H}}}{\nu
      A}},}]
where
      DH is the hydraulic_diameter of the pipe (the inside diameter if the pipe
      is circular) (m),
      Q is the volumetric flow_rate (m3/s),
      A is the pipe's cross-sectional area (m2),
      u is the mean velocity of the fluid (m/s),
      Î¼ (mu) is the dynamic_viscosity of the fluid (PaÂ·s = NÂ·s/m2 = kg/
      (mÂ·s)),
      Î½ (nu) is the kinematic_viscosity (Î½ = Î¼/Ï) (m2/s),
      Ï is the density of the fluid (kg/m3).
For shapes such as squares, rectangular or annular ducts where the height and
width are comparable, the characteristic dimension for internal-flow situations
is taken to be the hydraulic_diameter, DH, defined as
          D  H   =    4 A  P   ,   {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4A}
      {P}},}  [{\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}={\frac {4A}{P}},}]
where A is the cross-sectional area, and P is the wetted_perimeter. The wetted
perimeter for a channel is the total perimeter of all channel walls that are in
contact with the flow.[11] This means that the length of the channel exposed to
air is not included in the wetted perimeter.
For a circular pipe, the hydraulic diameter is exactly equal to the inside pipe
diameter:
          D  H   = D .   {\displaystyle D_{\text{H}}=D.}  [{\displaystyle D_
      {\text{H}}=D.}]
For an annular duct, such as the outer channel in a tube-in-tube heat
exchanger, the hydraulic diameter can be shown algebraically to reduce to
          D  H,annulus   =  D  o   &#x2212;  D  i   ,   {\displaystyle D_{\text
      {H,annulus}}=D_{\text{o}}-D_{\text{i}},}  [{\displaystyle D_{\text
      {H,annulus}}=D_{\text{o}}-D_{\text{i}},}]
where
      Do is the inside diameter of the outer pipe,
      Di is the outside diameter of the inner pipe.
For calculation involving flow in non-circular ducts, the hydraulic diameter
can be substituted for the diameter of a circular duct, with reasonable
accuracy, if the aspect ratio AR of the duct cross-section remains in the range
1/4 < AR < 4.[12]
***** Laminarâturbulent transition[edit] *****
Main article: Laminarâturbulent_transition
In boundary_layer flow over a flat plate, experiments confirm that, after a
certain length of flow, a laminar boundary layer will become unstable and
turbulent. This instability occurs across different scales and with different
fluids, usually when Rex â 5Ã105,[13] where x is the distance from the
leading edge of the flat plate, and the flow velocity is the freestream
velocity of the fluid outside the boundary layer.
For flow in a pipe of diameter D, experimental observations show that for
"fully developed" flow,[n_2] laminar flow occurs when ReD < 2300 and turbulent
flow occurs when ReD > 2900.[14][15] At the lower end of this range, a
continuous turbulent-flow will form, but only at a very long distance from the
inlet of the pipe. The flow in between will begin to transition from laminar to
turbulent and then back to laminar at irregular intervals, called intermittent
flow. This is due to the different speeds and conditions of the fluid in
different areas of the pipe's cross-section, depending on other factors such as
pipe roughness and flow uniformity. Laminar flow tends to dominate in the fast-
moving center of the pipe while slower-moving turbulent flow dominates near the
wall. As the Reynolds number increases, the continuous turbulent-flow moves
closer to the inlet and the intermittency in between increases, until the flow
becomes fully turbulent at ReD > 2900.[14] This result is generalized to non-
circular channels using the hydraulic_diameter, allowing a transition Reynolds
number to be calculated for other shapes of channel.[14]
These transition Reynolds numbers are also called critical Reynolds numbers,
and were studied by Osborne Reynolds around 1895.[5] The critical Reynolds
number is different for every geometry.[16]
***** Flow in a wide duct[edit] *****
For a fluid moving between two plane parallel surfacesâwhere the width is
much greater than the space between the platesâthen the characteristic
dimension is equal to twice the distance between the plates. This is consistent
with the annular duct and rectangular duct cases above taken to a limiting
aspect ratio.
***** Flow in an open channel[edit] *****
For flow of liquid with a free surface, the hydraulic_radius must be
determined. This is the cross-sectional area of the channel divided by the
wetted perimeter. For a semi-circular channel, it is quarter the diameter (in
case of full pipe flow). For a rectangular channel, the hydraulic radius is the
cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter. Some texts then use a
characteristic dimension that is four times the hydraulic radius, chosen
because it gives the same value of Re for the onset of turbulence as in pipe
flow,[17] while others use the hydraulic radius as the characteristic length-
scale with consequently different values of Re for transition and turbulent
flow.
***** Flow around airfoils[edit] *****
Reynolds numbers are used in airfoil design to (among other things) manage
"scale effect" when computing/comparing characteristics (a tiny wing, scaled to
be huge, will perform differently).[18] Fluid dynamicists define the chord
Reynolds number R like this: R = Vc/Î½, where V is the flight speed, c is the
chord length, and Î½ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in which the
airfoil operates, which is 1.460Ã10â5 m2/s for the atmosphere at sea_level.
[19] In some special studies a characteristic length other than chord may be
used; rare is the "span Reynolds number", which is not to be confused with
spanwise stations on a wing, where chord is still used.[20]
***** Object in a fluid[edit] *****
The Reynolds number for an object moving in a fluid, called the particle
Reynolds number and often denoted Rep, characterizes the nature of the
surrounding flow and its fall velocity.
**** In viscous fluids[edit] ****

The high viscosity of honey results in perfectly laminar flow when poured from
a bucket, while the low surface tension allows it to remain sheet-like even
after reaching the fluid below. Analogous to turbulence, when the flow meets
resistance it slows and begins oscillating back and forth, piling upon itself.
Creeping flow past a falling sphere: streamlines, drag force Fd and force by
gravity Fg.
Where the viscosity is naturally high, such as polymer solutions and polymer
melts, flow is normally laminar. The Reynolds number is very small and Stokes'
law can be used to measure the viscosity of the fluid. Spheres are allowed to
fall through the fluid and they reach the terminal_velocity quickly, from which
the viscosity can be determined.
The laminar flow of polymer solutions is exploited by animals such as fish and
dolphins, who exude viscous solutions from their skin to aid flow over their
bodies while swimming. It has been used in yacht racing by owners who want to
gain a speed advantage by pumping a polymer solution such as low molecular
weight polyoxyethylene in water, over the wetted surface of the hull.
It is, however, a problem for mixing of polymers, because turbulence is needed
to distribute fine filler (for example) through the material. Inventions such
as the "cavity transfer mixer" have been developed to produce multiple folds
into a moving melt so as to improve mixing efficiency. The device can be fitted
onto extruders to aid mixing.
**** Sphere in a fluid[edit] ****
For a sphere in a fluid, the characteristic length-scale is the diameter of the
sphere and the characteristic velocity is that of the sphere relative to the
fluid some distance away from the sphere, such that the motion of the sphere
does not disturb that reference parcel of fluid. The density and viscosity are
those belonging to the fluid.[21] Note that purely laminar flow only exists up
to Re = 10 under this definition.
Under the condition of low Re, the relationship between force and speed of
motion is given by Stokes'_law.[22]
**** Rectangular object in a fluid[edit] ****
The equation for a rectangular object is identical to that of a sphere, with
the object being approximated as an ellipsoid and the axis of length being
chosen as the characteristic length scale. Such considerations are important in
natural streams, for example, where there are few perfectly spherical grains.
For grains in which measurement of each axis is impractical, sieve diameters
are used instead as the characteristic particle length-scale. Both
approximations alter the values of the critical Reynolds number.
**** Fall velocity[edit] ****
The particle Reynolds number is important in determining the fall velocity of a
particle. When the particle Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, Stokes'_law
can be used to calculate its fall velocity. When the particle Reynolds number
indicates turbulent flow, a turbulent drag law must be constructed to model the
appropriate settling velocity.
**** Packed bed[edit] ****
For fluid flow through a bed, of approximately spherical particles of diameter
D in contact, if the voidage is Îµ and the superficial_velocity is vs, the
Reynolds number can be defined as[23]
          R e  =    &#x03C1;  v  s   D  &#x03BC;   ,   {\displaystyle \mathrm
      {Re} ={\frac {\rho v_{\text{s}}D}{\mu }},}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re}
      ={\frac {\rho v_{\text{s}}D}{\mu }},}]
or
          R e  =    &#x03C1;  v  s   D   &#x03BC; &#x03B5;    ,
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho v_{\text{s}}D}{\mu \varepsilon
      }},}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho v_{\text{s}}D}{\mu
      \varepsilon }},}]
or
          R e  =    &#x03C1;  v  s   D   &#x03BC; ( 1 &#x2212; &#x03B5; )    .
      {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho v_{\text{s}}D}{\mu (1-
      \varepsilon )}}.}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho v_{\text
      {s}}D}{\mu (1-\varepsilon )}}.}]
The choice of equation depends on the system involved: the first is successful
in correlating the data for various types of packed and fluidized_beds, the
second Reynolds number suits for the liquid-phase data, while the third was
found successful in correlating the fluidized bed data, being first introduced
for liquid fluidized bed system.[23]
Laminar conditions apply up to Re = 10, fully turbulent from Re = 2000.[21]
**** Stirred vessel[edit] ****
In a cylindrical vessel stirred by a central rotating paddle, turbine or
propeller, the characteristic dimension is the diameter of the agitator D. The
velocity V is ND where N is the rotational_speed in rad per second. Then the
Reynolds number is:
          R e  =    &#x03C1; N  D  2    &#x03BC;   =    &#x03C1; V D  &#x03BC;
      .   {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho ND^{2}}{\mu }}={\frac {\rho
      VD}{\mu }}.}  [{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho ND^{2}}{\mu }}=
      {\frac {\rho VD}{\mu }}.}]
The system is fully turbulent for values of Re above 10000.[24]
***** Pipe friction[edit] *****
The Moody_diagram, which describes the DarcyâWeisbach_friction_factor f as a
function of the Reynolds number and relative pipe roughness.
Pressure drops[25] seen for fully developed flow of fluids through pipes can be
predicted using the Moody_diagram which plots the DarcyâWeisbach_friction
factor f against Reynolds number Re and relative roughness Îµ/D. The diagram
clearly shows the laminar, transition, and turbulent flow regimes as Reynolds
number increases. The nature of pipe flow is strongly dependent on whether the
flow is laminar or turbulent.
***** Similarity of flows[edit] *****
Qualitative behaviors of fluid flow over a cylinder depends to a large extent
on Reynolds number; similar flow patterns often appear when the shape and
Reynolds number is matched, although other parameters like surface roughness
have a big effect.
In order for two flows to be similar, they must have the same geometry and
equal Reynolds and Euler_numbers. When comparing fluid behavior at
corresponding points in a model and a full-scale flow, the following holds:
               R e   m      =  R e  ,       E u   m      =  E u  ,
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Re} _{\text{m}}&=\mathrm {Re}
      ,\\\mathrm {Eu} _{\text{m}}&=\mathrm {Eu} ,\end{aligned}}}  [
      {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Re} _{\text{m}}&=\mathrm {Re}
      ,\\\mathrm {Eu} _{\text{m}}&=\mathrm {Eu} ,\end{aligned}}}]
where       R e   m     {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} _{\text{m}}}  [
{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} _{\text{m}}}] is the Reynolds number for the model,
and      R e    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} }  [{\mathrm  {Re}}] is full-scale
Reynolds number, and similarly for the Euler numbers.
The model numbers and design numbers should be in the same proportion, hence
            p  m     &#x03C1;  m    v  m   2      =   p  &#x03C1;  v  2      .
      {\displaystyle {\frac {p_{\text{m}}}{\rho _{\text{m}}v_{\text{m}}^{2}}}=
      {\frac {p}{\rho v^{2}}}.}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {p_{\text{m}}}{\rho _
      {\text{m}}v_{\text{m}}^{2}}}={\frac {p}{\rho v^{2}}}.}]
This allows engineers to perform experiments with reduced scale models in water
channels or wind_tunnels and correlate the data to the actual flows, saving on
costs during experimentation and on lab time. Note that true dynamic similitude
may require matching other dimensionless_numbers as well, such as the Mach
number used in compressible_flows, or the Froude_number that governs open-
channel flows. Some flows involve more dimensionless parameters than can be
practically satisfied with the available apparatus and fluids, so one is forced
to decide which parameters are most important. For experimental flow modeling
to be useful, it requires a fair amount of experience and judgment of the
engineer.
An example where the mere Reynolds number is not sufficient for similarity of
flows (or even the flow regime â laminar or turbulent) are bounded flows,
i.e. flows that are restricted by walls or other boundaries. A classical
example of this is the TaylorâCouette_flow, where the dimensionless ratio of
radii of bounding cylinders is also important, and many technical applications
where these distinctions play an important role.[26][27] Principles of these
restrictions were developed by Maurice_Marie_Alfred_Couette and Geoffrey_Ingram
Taylor and developed further by Floris_Takens and David_Ruelle.

In a turbulent flow, there is a range of scales of the time-varying fluid
motion. The size of the largest scales of fluid motion (sometimes called
eddies) are set by the overall geometry of the flow. For instance, in an
industrial smoke stack, the largest scales of fluid motion are as big as the
diameter of the stack itself. The size of the smallest scales is set by the
Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller scales
of the flow are visible. In a smoke stack, the smoke may appear to have many
very small velocity perturbations or eddies, in addition to large bulky eddies.
In this sense, the Reynolds number is an indicator of the range of scales in
the flow. The higher the Reynolds number, the greater the range of scales. The
largest eddies will always be the same size; the smallest eddies are determined
by the Reynolds number.
What is the explanation for this phenomenon? A large Reynolds number indicates
that viscous forces are not important at large scales of the flow. With a
strong predominance of inertial forces over viscous forces, the largest scales
of fluid motion are undampedâthere is not enough viscosity to dissipate their
motions. The kinetic energy must "cascade" from these large scales to
progressively smaller scales until a level is reached for which the scale is
small enough for viscosity to become important (that is, viscous forces become
of the order of inertial ones). It is at these small scales where the
dissipation of energy by viscous action finally takes place. The Reynolds
number indicates at what scale this viscous dissipation occurs.

Poiseuille's_law on blood circulation in the body is dependent on laminar_flow.
In turbulent flow the flow rate is proportional to the square root of the
pressure gradient, as opposed to its direct proportionality to pressure
gradient in laminar flow.
Using the definition of the Reynolds number we can see that a large diameter
with rapid flow, where the density of the blood is high, tends towards
turbulence. Rapid changes in vessel diameter may lead to turbulent flow, for
instance when a narrower vessel widens to a larger one. Furthermore, a bulge of
atheroma may be the cause of turbulent flow, where audible turbulence may be
detected with a stethoscope.
***** Complex systems[edit] *****
Reynolds number interpretation has been extended into the area of arbitrary
complex_systems. Such as financial flows,[30] nonlinear networks,[31] etc. In
the latter case an artificial viscosity is reduced to nonlinear mechanism of
energy distribution in complex_network media. Reynolds number then represents a
basic control parameter which expresses a balance between injected and
dissipated energy flows for open boundary system. It has been shown [31] that
Reynolds critical regime separates two types of phase space motion: accelerator
(attractor) and decelerator. High Reynolds number leads to a chaotic regime
transition only in frame of strange_attractor model.

The Reynolds number can be obtained when one uses the nondimensional form of
the incompressible NavierâStokes_equations for a newtonian fluid expressed in
terms of the Lagrangian_derivative:
         &#x03C1;    D  v    D t    = &#x2212; &#x2207; p + &#x03BC;  &#x2207;
      2    v  + &#x03C1;  f  .   {\displaystyle \rho {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }
      {Dt}}=-\nabla p+\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v} +\rho \mathbf {f} .}  [\rho
      {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}=-\nabla p+\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v} +\rho
      \mathbf {f} .]
Each term in the above equation has the units of a "body force" (force per unit
volume) with the same dimensions of a density times an acceleration. Each term
is thus dependent on the exact measurements of a flow. When one renders the
equation nondimensional, that is when we multiply it by a factor with inverse
units of the base equation, we obtain a form that does not depend directly on
the physical sizes. One possible way to obtain a nondimensional equation is to
multiply the whole equation by the factor
           L  &#x03C1;  V  2      ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {L}{\rho V^{2}}},}
      [{\displaystyle {\frac {L}{\rho V^{2}}},}]
where
      V is the mean velocity, v or v, relative to the fluid (m/s),
      L is the characteristic length (m),
      Ï is the fluid density (kg/m3).
If we now set
           v  &#x2032;  =    v  V   ,   p &#x2032;  = p   1  &#x03C1;  V  2
      ,    f  &#x2032;  =  f    L  V  2     ,    &#x2202;  &#x2202;  t &#x2032;
      =   L V     &#x2202;  &#x2202; t    ,   &#x2207; &#x2032;  = L &#x2207; ,
      {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} '={\frac {\mathbf {v} }{V}},\quad p'=p{\frac
      {1}{\rho V^{2}}},\quad \mathbf {f} '=\mathbf {f} {\frac {L}{V^{2}}},\quad
      {\frac {\partial }{\partial t'}}={\frac {L}{V}}{\frac {\partial }
      {\partial t}},\quad \nabla '=L\nabla ,}  [{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} '=
      {\frac {\mathbf {v} }{V}},\quad p'=p{\frac {1}{\rho V^{2}}},\quad \mathbf
      {f} '=\mathbf {f} {\frac {L}{V^{2}}},\quad {\frac {\partial }{\partial
      t'}}={\frac {L}{V}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}},\quad \nabla '=L\nabla
      ,}]
we can rewrite the NavierâStokes equation without dimensions:
            D   v  &#x2032;    D  t &#x2032;     = &#x2212;  &#x2207; &#x2032;
      p &#x2032;  +   &#x03BC;  &#x03C1; L V     &#x2207;  &#x2032;  2      v
      &#x2032;  +   f  &#x2032;  ,   {\displaystyle {\frac {D\mathbf {v} '}
      {Dt'}}=-\nabla 'p'+{\frac {\mu }{\rho LV}}\nabla '^{2}\mathbf {v}
      '+\mathbf {f} ',}  [{\displaystyle {\frac {D\mathbf {v} '}{Dt'}}=-\nabla
      'p'+{\frac {\mu }{\rho LV}}\nabla '^{2}\mathbf {v} '+\mathbf {f} ',}]
where the term Î¼/ÏLV = 1/Re.
Finally, dropping the primes for ease of reading:
            D  v    D t    = &#x2212; &#x2207; p +   1  R e     &#x2207;  2
      v  +  f  .   {\displaystyle {\frac {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}=-\nabla p+{\frac
      {1}{\mathrm {Re} }}\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {f} .}  [{\frac
      {D\mathbf {v} }{Dt}}=-\nabla p+{\frac {1}{\mathrm {Re} }}\nabla ^
      {2}\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {f} .]
This is why mathematically all Newtonian, incompressible flows with the same
Reynolds number are comparable. Notice also that in the above equation, the
viscous terms vanish for Re â â. Thus flows with high Reynolds numbers are
approximately inviscid in the free stream.
***** Relationship to other dimensionless parameters[edit] *****
There are many dimensionless_numbers_in_fluid_mechanics. The Reynolds number
measures the ratio of advection and diffusion effects on structures in the
velocity field, and is therefore closely related to PÃ©clet_numbers, which
measure the ratio of these effects on other fields carried by the flow, for
example temperature and magnetic fields. Replacement of the kinematic_viscosity
Î½ = Î¼/Ï in Re by the thermal or magnetic diffusivity results in respectively
the thermal PÃ©clet number and the magnetic_Reynolds_number. These are
therefore related to Re by products with ratios of diffusivities, namely the
Prandtl_number and magnetic_Prandtl_number.

***** Notes[edit] *****
   1. ^ The definition of the Reynolds number is not to be confused with the
      Reynolds_equation or lubrication equation.
   2. ^ Full development of the flow occurs as the flow enters the pipe, the
      boundary layer thickens and then stabilizes after several diameters
      distance into the pipe.
