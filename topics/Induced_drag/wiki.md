****** Lift-induced drag ******
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump_to_navigation Jump_to_search
In aerodynamics, lift-induced drag, induced drag, vortex drag, or sometimes
drag due to lift, is an aerodynamic_drag force that occurs whenever a moving
object redirects the airflow coming at it. This drag force occurs in airplanes
due to wings or a lifting_body redirecting air to cause lift and also in cars
with airfoil wings that redirect air to cause a downforce.
Samuel_Langley observed higher aspect_ratio flat plates had higher lift and
lower drag and stated in 1902 âA plane of fixed size and weight would need
less propulsive power the faster it flewâ, the counter-intuitive effect of
induced drag.[1]

***** Source of induced drag[edit] *****
Induced drag is related to the amount of induced downwash in the vicinity of
the wing. The grey vertical line labeled "L" is perpendicular to the free
stream and indicates the orientation of the lift on the wing. The red vector
labeled "Leff" is perpendicular to the actual airflow in the vicinity of the
wing; it represents the lift on the airfoil section in twoâdimensional flow
at the same angle of attack. The lift generated by the wing has been tilted
rearwards through an angle equal to the angle of the downwash in three-
dimensional flow. The component of "Leff" parallel to the free stream is the
induced drag on the wing.[2][3][4]
The total aerodynamic_force acting on a body is usually thought of as having
two components, lift and drag. By definition, the component of force parallel
to the oncoming flow is called drag; and the component perpendicular to the
oncoming flow is called lift.[5] At practical angles_of_attack the lift greatly
exceeds the drag.[6]
Lift is produced by the changing direction of the flow around a wing. The
change of direction results in a change of velocity (even if there is no speed
change, just as seen in uniform circular motion), which is an acceleration. To
change the direction of the flow therefore requires that a force be applied to
the fluid; lift is simply the reaction force of the fluid acting on the wing.
To produce lift, air below the wing is at a higher pressure than the air
pressure above the wing. On a wing of finite span, this pressure difference
causes air to flow from the lower surface wing root, around the wingtip,
towards the upper surface wing root. This spanwise flow of air combines with
chordwise flowing air, causing a change in speed and direction, which twists
the airflow and produces vortices along the wing trailing edge. The vortices
created are unstable, and they quickly combine to produce wingtip_vortices.[7]
The resulting vortices change the speed and direction of the airflow behind the
trailing edge, deflecting it downwards, and thus inducing downwash behind the
wing.
Wingtip vortices modify the airflow around a wing, reducing wing's ability to
generate lift, so that it requires a higher angle of attack for the same lift,
which tilts the total aerodynamic force rearwards and increases the drag
component of that force. The angular deflection is small and has little effect
on the lift. However, there is an increase in the drag equal to the product of
the lift force and the angle through which it is deflected. Since the
deflection is itself a function of the lift, the additional drag is
proportional to the square of the lift.[8]
***** Reducing induced drag[edit] *****
According to the equations below, a wing of infinite aspect ratio (wingspan/
chord length) and constant airfoil section would produce no induced drag. The
characteristics of such a wing can be measured on a section of wing spanning
the width of a wind_tunnel, since the walls block spanwise flow and create what
is effectively two-dimensional flow.
A rectangular planform wing produces stronger wingtip vortices than does a
tapered or elliptical_wing, therefore many modern wings are tapered. However,
an elliptical planform is more efficient as the induced downwash (and therefore
the effective angle of attack) is constant across the whole of the wingspan.
Few aircraft have this planform because of manufacturing complications â the
most famous examples being the World_War_II Spitfire and Thunderbolt. Tapered
wings with straight leading and trailing edges can approximate to elliptical
lift distribution. Typically, straight edged non-tapered wings produce 5%, and
tapered wings produce 1-2% more induced drag than an elliptical wing.[9]
Similarly, for a given wing area, a high aspect_ratio wing will produce less
induced drag than a wing of low aspect ratio because there is less air
disturbance at the tip of a longer, thinner wing.[10] Induced drag can
therefore be said to be inversely proportional to aspect ratio.[11] The lift
distribution may also be modified by the use of washout, a spanwise twist of
the wing to reduce the incidence towards the wingtips, and by changing the
airfoil section near the wingtips. This allows more lift to be generated nearer
the wing root and less towards the wingtip, which causes a reduction in the
strength of the wingtip vortices.
Some early aircraft had fins mounted on the tips of the tailplane which served
as endplates. More recent aircraft have wingtip mounted winglets to reduce the
intensity of wingtip vortices.[12] Wingtip mounted fuel tanks or in extreme
cases, propellers, may also provide some benefit, by preventing the spanwise
flow of air around the wingtip.
***** Calculation of induced drag[edit] *****
For a planar wing with an elliptical lift distribution, induced drag can be
calculated as follows:
          D  i   =    L  2      1 2   &#x03C1;  V  2   &#x03C0;  b  2
      {\displaystyle D_{\text{i}}={\frac {L^{2}}{{\frac {1}{2}}\rho V^{2}\pi b^
      {2}}}}  [{\displaystyle D_{\text{i}}={\frac {L^{2}}{{\frac {1}{2}}\rho V^
      {2}\pi b^{2}}}}],
where
         L    {\displaystyle L\,}  [L\,] is the lift,
         &#x03C1;    {\displaystyle \rho \,}  [{\displaystyle \rho \,}] is the
      air density,
         V    {\displaystyle V\,}  [V\,] is the true airspeed, and
         b    {\displaystyle b\,}  [{\displaystyle b\,}] is the wingspan.
From this equation it is clear that the induced drag decreases with flight
speed and with wingspan. Deviation from the non-planar wing with elliptical
lift distribution are taken into account by dividing the induced drag by the
span efficiency_factor_____e___{\displaystyle_e}__[e].
To compare with other sources of drag, it can be convenient to express this
equation in terms of lift and drag coefficients[13]:
          C  D ,  i    =    D  i      1 2   &#x03C1;  V  2   S    =    C  L   2
      &#x03C0; A    R       {\displaystyle C_{D,{\text{i}}}={\frac {D_{\text
      {i}}}{{\frac {1}{2}}\rho V^{2}S}}={\frac {C_{L}^{2}}{\pi A\!\!{\text
      {R}}}}}  [{\displaystyle C_{D,{\text{i}}}={\frac {D_{\text{i}}}{{\frac
      {1}{2}}\rho V^{2}S}}={\frac {C_{L}^{2}}{\pi A\!\!{\text{R}}}}}], where
          C  L   =   L    1 2   &#x03C1;  V  2   S      {\displaystyle C_{L}=
      {\frac {L}{{\frac {1}{2}}\rho V^{2}S}}}  [{\displaystyle C_{L}={\frac {L}
      {{\frac {1}{2}}\rho V^{2}S}}}]
and
         A    R  =    b  2   S      {\displaystyle A\!\!{\text{R}}={\frac {b^
      {2}}{S}}\,}  [{\displaystyle A\!\!{\text{R}}={\frac {b^{2}}{S}}\,}] is
      the aspect_ratio,
         S    {\displaystyle S\,}  [S\,] is a reference wing area.
This indicates how high-aspect ratio wings are beneficial to flight efficiency.
With      C  L     {\displaystyle C_{L}}  [C_{L}] being a function of angle of
attack, induced drag increases as the angle_of_attack increases,[8] up to the
stall_angle.
The above equation can be derived using Prandtl's_lifting-line_theory. Similar
methods can also be used to compute the minimum induced drag for non-planar
wings or for arbitrary lift distributions.
***** Combined effect with other drag sources[edit] *****
Total drag is parasitic_drag plus induced drag
Induced drag must be added to the parasitic_drag to find the total drag. Since
induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the airspeed (at a
given lift) whereas parasitic drag is proportional to the square of the
airspeed, the combined overall drag curve shows a minimum at some airspeed -
the minimum drag speed (VMD). An aircraft flying at this speed is operating at
its optimal aerodynamic efficiency. According to the above equations, the speed
for minimum drag occurs at the speed where the induced drag is equal to the
parasitic drag.[14] This is the speed at which for unpowered aircraft, optimum
glide angle is achieved. This is also the speed for greatest range (although
VMD will decrease as the plane consumes fuel and becomes lighter). The speed
for greatest range (i.e., distance travelled) is the speed at which a straight
line from the origin is tangent to the fuel flow rate curve. The curve of range
versus airspeed is normally very flat and it is customary to operate at the
speed for 99% best range since this gives about 5% greater speed for only 1%
less range. (Of course, flying higher where the air is thinner will raise the
speed at which minimum drag occurs, and so permits a faster voyage for the same
amount of fuel. If the plane is flying at the maximum permissible speed, then
there is an altitude at which the air density will be what is needed to keep it
aloft while flying at the angle of attack that minimizes the drag. The optimum
altitude at maximum speed, and the optimum speed at maximum altitude, may
change during the flight as the plane becomes lighter.)
The speed for maximum endurance (i.e., time in the air) is the speed for
minimum fuel flow rate, and is less than the speed for greatest range. The fuel
flow rate is calculated as the product of the power required and the engine
specific fuel consumption (fuel flow rate per unit of power[15]). The power
required is equal to the drag times the speed.
