From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

"Specification" redirects here. For other uses, see Specification_
(disambiguation).
A specification often refers to a set of documented requirements to be
satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.[1] A specification is
often a type of technical_standard.
There are different types of technical or engineering specifications (specs),
and the term is used differently in different technical contexts. They often
refer to particular documents, and/or particular information within them. The
word specification is broadly defined as "to state explicitly or in detail" or
"to be specific".
Using the term "specification" without a clear indication of what kind is
confusing and considered bad practice.[according_to_whom?]
A requirement specification is a documented requirement, or set of documented
requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service,
etc.[2] It is a common early part of engineering_design and product_development
processes, in many fields.
A functional specification is a kind of requirement specification, and may show
functional block diagrams.[citation_needed]
A design or product specification describes the features of the solutions for
the Requirement Specification, referring to either a designed solution or final
produced solution. It is often used to guide fabrication/production. Sometimes
the term specification is here used in connection with a data_sheet (or spec
sheet), which may be confusing. A data sheet describes the technical
characteristics of an item or product, often published by a manufacturer to
help people choose or use the products. A data sheet is not a technical
specification in the sense of informing how to produce.
An "in-service" or "maintained as" specification, specifies the conditions of a
system or object after years of operation, including the effects of wear and
maintenance (configuration changes).
Specifications are a type of technical standard that may be developed by any of
various kinds of organizations, both public and private. Example organization
types include a corporation, a consortium (a small group of corporations), a
trade_association (an industry-wide group of corporations), a national
government (including its military, regulatory_agencies, and national
laboratories and institutes), a professional_association (society), a purpose-
made standards_organization such as ISO, or vendor-neutral developed generic
requirements. It is common for one organization to refer to (reference, call
out, cite) the standards of another. Voluntary standards may become mandatory
if adopted by a government or business contract.

***** Use[edit] *****
In engineering, manufacturing, and business, it is vital for suppliers,
purchasers, and users of materials, products, or services to understand and
agree upon all requirements.[3]
A specification may refer to a standard which is often referenced by a contract
or procurement document, or an otherwise agreed upon set of requirements
(though still often used in the singular). In any case, it provides the
necessary details about the specific requirements.
Standards for specifications may be provided by government agencies, standards
organizations (SAE, AWS, NIST, ASTM, ISO, CEN, DoD, etc.), trade associations,
corporations, and others. The following British_standards apply to
specifications:
    * BS 7373-1:2001 Guide to the preparation of specifications [4]
    * BS 7373-2:2001 Product specifications. Guide to identifying criteria for
      a product specification and to declaring product conformity [5]
    * BS 7373-3:2005, Product specifications. Guide to identifying criteria for
      specifying a service offering [6]
A design/product specification does not necessarily prove a product to be
correct or useful in every context. An item might be verified to comply with a
specification or stamped with a specification number: this does not, by itself,
indicate that the item is fit for other, non-validated uses. The people who use
the item (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify the item (building codes,
government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of
available specifications, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use
the item correctly. Validation of suitability is necessary.
***** Guidance and content[edit] *****
Sometimes a guide or a standard_operating_procedure is available to help write
and format a good specification.[7][8][9] A specification might include:
    * Descriptive title, number, identifier, etc. of the specification
    * Date of last effective revision and revision designation
    * A logo or trademark to indicate the document copyright, ownership and
      origin[10]
    * Table of Contents (TOC), if the document is long
    * Person, office, or agency responsible for questions on the specification,
      updates, and deviations.
    * The significance, scope or importance of the specification and its
      intended use.
    * Terminology, definitions and abbreviations to clarify the meanings of the
      specification[11][12]
    * Test_methods for measuring all specified characteristics
    * Material requirements: physical, mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc.
      Targets and tolerances.
    * Acceptance_testing, including Performance_testing requirements. Targets
      and tolerances.
    * Drawings, photographs, or technical_illustrations
    * Workmanship
    * Certifications required.
    * Safety considerations and requirements
    * Environmental considerations and requirements
    * Quality_control requirements, acceptance_sampling, inspections,
      acceptance criteria
    * Person, office, or agency responsible for enforcement of the
      specification.
    * Completion and delivery.
    * Provisions for rejection, reinspection, rehearing, corrective measures
    * References and citations for which any instructions in the content maybe
      required to fulfill the traceability and clarity of the document[12][13]
      [14]
    * Signatures of approval, if necessary[15]
    * Change_record to summarize the chronological development, revision and
      completion if the document is to be circulated internally[16]
    * Annexes_and_Appendices that are expand details, add clarification, or
      offer options.[16]
***** Construction specifications[edit] *****
**** Construction Specifications in North America[edit] ****
Specifications in North America form part of the contract documents that
accompany and govern the construction of building and infrastructure projects.
Specifications describe the quality and performance of building materials,
using code citations and published standards, whereas the drawings or Building
Information Model (BIM) illustrates quantity and location of materials. The
guiding master document of names and numbers is the latest edition of
MasterFormat. This is a consensus document that is jointly sponsored by two
professional organizations: Construction_Specifications_Canada and Construction
Specifications Institute based in the United States and updated every two
years.
While there is a tendency to believe that "Specifications overrule Drawings" in
the event of discrepancies between the text document and the drawings, the
actual intent must be made explicit in the contract between the Owner and the
Contractor. The standard AIA (American Institute of Architects) and EJCDC
(Engineering Joint Contract Documents Committee) states that the drawings and
specifications are complementary, together providing the information required
for a complete facility. Many public agencies, such as the Naval Facilities
Command (NAVFAC) state that the specifications overrule the drawings. This is
based on the idea that words are easier for a jury (or mediator) to interpret
than drawings in case of a dispute.
The standard listing of construction specifications falls into 50_Divisions, or
broad categories of work types and work results involved in construction. The
divisions are subdivided into sections, each one addressing a specific material
type (concrete) or a work product (steel door) of the construction work. A
specific material may be covered in several locations, depending on the work
result: stainless steel (for example) can be covered as a sheet material used
in Flashing and Sheet Metal in Division 07; it can be part of a finished
product, such as a handrail, covered in Division 05; or it can be a component
of building hardware, covered in Division 08. The original listing of
specification divisions was based on the time sequence of construction, working
from exterior to interior, and this logic is still somewhat followed as new
materials and systems make their way into the construction process.
Each Section is subdivided into three distinct Parts: "General", "Products" and
"Execution". The MasterFormat and Section Format [17]system can be successfully
applied to residential, commercial, civil, and industrial construction.
Although many Architects find the rather voluminous commercial style of
specifications too lengthy for most residential projects and therefore either
produce more abbreviated specifications of their own or use ArCHspec (which was
specifically created for residential projects). Master specification systems
are available from multiple vendors such as Arcom, Visispec, BSD, and Spectext.
These systems were created to standardize language across the United States and
are usually subscription based.
Specifications can be either "performance-based", whereby the specifier
restricts the text to stating the performance that must be achieved by the
completed work, "prescriptive" where the specifier states the specific criteria
such as fabrication standards applicable to the item, or "proprietary", whereby
the specifier indicates specific products, vendors and even contractors that
are acceptable for each workscope. In addition, specifications can be "closed"
with a specific list of products, or "open" allowing for substitutions made by
the Contractor. Most construction specifications are a combination of
performance-based and proprietrary types, naming acceptable manufacturers and
products while also specifying certain standards and design criteria that must
be met.
While North American specifications are usually restricted to broad
descriptions of the work, European ones and Civil work can include actual work
quantities, including such things as area of drywall to be built in square
meters, like a bill of materials. This type of specification is a collaborative
effort between a specwriter and a quantity_surveyor. This approach is unusual
in North America, where each bidder performs a quantity survey on the basis of
both drawings and specifications. In many countries on the European continent,
content that might be described as "specifications" in the United States are
covered under the building code or municipal code. Civil and infrastructure
work in the United States often includes a quantity breakdown of the work to be
performed as well.
Although specifications are usually issued by the architect's office,
specification writing itself is undertaken by the architect and the various
engineers or by specialist specification writers. Specification writing is
often a distinct professional trade, with professional certifications such as
"Certified Construction Specifier" (CCS) available through the Construction
Specifications Institute and the Registered Specification Writer (RSW)[18]
through Construction Specifications Canada. Specification writers are either
employees of or sub-contractors to architects, engineers, or construction
management companies. Specification writers frequently meet with manufacturers
of building_materials who seek to have their products specified on upcoming
construction projects so that contractors can include their products in the
estimates leading to their proposals.
In February 2015, ArCHspec went live, from ArCH (Architects Creating Homes), a
nationwide American professional society of Architects whose purpose is to
improve residential architecture. ArCHspec was created specifically for use by
Licensed Architects while designing SFR (Single Family Residential)
architectural projects. Unlike the more commercial CSI (50+ division commercial
specifications), ArCHspec utilizes the more recognizable 16 traditional
Divisions, plus a Division 0 (Scope & Bid Forms) and Division 17 (low voltage).
Many architects, up to this point, did not provide specifications for
residential designs, which is one of the reasons ArCHspec was created: to fill
a void in the industry with more compact specifications for residential use.
Shorter form specifications documents suitable for residential use are also
available through Arcom, and follow the 50 division format, which was adopted
in both the United States and Canada starting in 2004. The 16 division format
is no longer considered standard, and is not supported by either CSI or CSC, or
any of the subscription master specification services, data repositories,
product lead systems, and the bulk of governmental agencies.
**** Construction specifications in Egypt[edit] ****
Specifications in Egypt form part of contract documents. The Housing and
Building National Research Center (HBRC) is responsible for developing
construction specifications and codes. The HBRC has published more than 15
books which cover building activities like earthworks, plastering, etc.
**** Construction specifications in the UK[edit] ****
Specifications in the UK are part of the contract documents that accompany and
govern the construction of a building. They are prepared by construction
professionals such as architects, architectural_technologists, structural
engineers, landscape_architects and building_services_engineers. They are
created from previous project specifications, in-house documents or master
specifications such as the National_Building_Specification (NBS). The National
Building Specification is owned by the Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects
(RIBA) through their commercial group RIBA Enterprises (RIBAe). NBS master
specifications provide content that is broad and comprehensive, and delivered
using software functionality that enables specifiers to customize the content
to suit the needs of the project and to keep up to date.
UK project specification types fall into two main categories prescriptive and
performance. Prescriptive specifications define the requirements using generic
or proprietary descriptions of what is required, whereas performance
specifications focus on the outcomes rather than the characteristics of the
components.
Specifications are an integral part of Building_Information_Modeling and cover
the non-geometric requirements.
***** Food and drug specifications[edit] *****
Pharmaceutical products can usually be tested and qualified by various
Pharmacopoeia. Current existing pharmaceutical standards include:
    * British_Pharmacopoeia
    * European_Pharmacopoeia
    * Japanese_Pharmacopoeia
    * The_International_Pharmacopoeia
    * United_States_Pharmacopeia
If any pharmaceutical product is not covered by the above standards, it can be
evaluated by the additional source of Pharmacopoeia from other nations, from
industrial specifications, or from a standardized formulary such as
    * British_National_Formulary_for_Children
    * British_National_Formulary
    * National_Formulary
A similar approach is adopted by the food manufacturing, of which Codex
Alimentarius ranks the highest standards, followed by regional and national
standards.[19]
The coverage of food and drug standards by ISO is currently less fruitful and
not yet put forward as an urgent agenda due to the tight restrictions of
regional or national constitution.[20][21]
Specifications and other standards can be externally imposed as discussed
above, but also internal manufacturing and quality specifications. These exist
not only for the food or pharmaceutical product but also for the processing
machinery, quality processes, packaging, logistics (cold_chain), etc. and are
exemplified by ISO 14134 and ISO 15609.[22][23]
The converse of explicit statement of specifications is a process for dealing
with observations that are out-of-specification. The United_States_Food_and
Drug_Administration has published a non-binding recommendation that addresses
just this point.[24]
At the present time, much of the information and regulations concerning food
and food products remain in a form which makes it difficult to apply automated
information processing, storage and transmission methods and techniques.
Data systems that can process, store and transfer information about food and
food products need formal specifications for the representations of data about
food and food products in order to operate effectively and efficiently.
Development of formal specifications for food and drug data with the necessary
and sufficient clarity and precision for use specifically by digital computing
systems have begun to emerge from some government agencies and standards
organizations: the United_States_Food_and_Drug_Administration has published
specifications for a "Structured Product Label" which drug manufacturers must
by mandate use to submit electronically the information on a drug label.[25]
Recently, the ISO has made some progress in the area of food and drug standards
and formal specifications for data about regulated substances through the
publication of ISO 11238.[26]
***** Information technology[edit] *****
**** Specification need[edit] ****
In many contexts, particularly software, specifications are needed to avoid
errors due to lack of compatibility, for instance, in interoperability issues.
For instance, when two applications share Unicode data, but use different
normal forms or use them incorrectly, in an incompatible way or without sharing
a minimum set of interoperability specification, errors and data loss can
result. For example, Mac OS X has many components that prefer or require only
decomposed characters (thus decomposed-only Unicode encoded with UTF-8 is also
known as "UTF8-MAC"). In one specific instance, the combination of OS X errors
handling composed characters, and the samba file- and printer-sharing software
(which replaces decomposed letters with composed ones when copying file names),
has led to confusing and data-destroying interoperability problems.[27][28]
Applications may avoid such errors by preserving input code points, and only
normalizing them to the application's preferred normal form for internal use.
Such errors may also be avoided with algorithms normalizing both strings before
any binary comparison.
However errors due to file name encoding incompatibilities have always existed,
due to a lack of minimum set of common specification between software hoped to
be inter-operable between various file system drivers, operating systems,
network protocols, and thousands of software packages.
**** Formal specification[edit] ****
Main article: Formal_specification
A formal specification is a mathematical description of software or hardware
that may be used to develop an implementation. It describes what the system
should do, not (necessarily) how the system should do it. Given such a
specification, it is possible to use formal_verification techniques to
demonstrate that a candidate system design is correct with respect to that
specification. This has the advantage that incorrect candidate system designs
can be revised before a major investment has been made in actually implementing
the design. An alternative approach is to use provably correct refinement steps
to transform a specification into a design, and ultimately into an actual
implementation, that is correct by construction.
**** Architectural specification[edit] ****
In (hardware, software, or enterprise) systems development, an architectural
specification is the set of documentation that describes the structure,
behavior, and more views of that system.
**** Program specification[edit] ****
A program specification is the definition of what a computer_program is
expected to do. It can be informal, in which case it can be considered as a
user manual from a developer point of view, or formal, in which case it has a
definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms. In practice,
many successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune
applications that were already well-developed, although safety-critical
software_systems are often carefully specified prior to application
development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that
must remain stable.
**** Functional specification[edit] ****
Main article: Functional_specification
In software_development, a functional specification (also, functional spec or
specs or functional specifications document (FSD)) is the set of documentation
that describes the behavior of a computer program or larger software_system.
The documentation typically describes various inputs that can be provided to
the software system and how the system responds to those inputs.
**** Web service specification[edit] ****
Further information: List_of_Web_service_specifications
Web services specifications are often under the umbrella of a quality
management_system.[29]
**** Document specification[edit] ****
These types of documents define how a specific document should be written,
which may include, but is not limited to, the systems of a document naming,
version, layout, referencing, structuring, appearance, language, copyright,
hierarchy or format, etc.[30][31] Very often, this kind of specifications is
complemented by a designated template.[32][33][34]
